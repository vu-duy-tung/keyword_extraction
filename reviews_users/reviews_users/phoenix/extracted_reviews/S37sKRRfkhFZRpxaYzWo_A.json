I ordered the egg rolls which were very \"meh\" but the noodles more than made up for it.

We also got a small plate of fresh veggies and pig ear. The food was fast, tasty, and cheap. I was a little disappointed with the seafood pasta dish in that it seemed to just be some corn, shrimp, and crab meat in alfredo sauce but that was more my fault on picking the wrong dish.   The noodles were soft and tender. You can also watch the guy match the noodles too. The small dishes or veggies and pig ear taht we got was a lot more than what I was expecting. I also liked that they give you a small dish of peanuts and radish. Overall the food was cheap and tasty which is what I like and look for.",

I can never finish an entire bowl, but get to have them for lunch the next day.  Ohh...the dumplings.  Best I've ever had and they are huge - and cheap.  Very casual, good service but not hovering.

People don't always know how to react to my food choices.  Yes, I'm sure I'd like the fish sauce, thanks.  I like it.  Yes, I know it stinks.  Its good.  The sliced beef was cold, which was unexpected, and it was super fatty, which was a bit weird.  I enjoyed it anyway.  The only fail was the spring rolls, they were cabbage egg rolls.  Ew. Inedible. The fried rolls with sweetened condensed milk were an amazing new find, I've not had those before coming to the hand tossed Chinese noodle places here in town.  If you aren't adventurous enough to try the more exotic items on the menu ( hot and spicy pig ears...ew! I'm not even that brave), you have to try these little fried dough balls of happiness! Yummy! Will definitely be back for more!",

I lived in China for a year and I ate more than my fair share of dumplings...and I will tell you that these are the only ones I've found in the US that we're even close to resembling what I had in china.  No, they aren't the same as the pre packaged skin, tiny, flavorless gray meat filling ones you get at nearly every other restaurant in the states. They are made fresh and legit. The skin is thick and chewy. The meat highly seasoned. And fried to perfection.   If you call Chinese dumplings by a Japanese spelling, that should tell you something. And ordering them steamed is a fail in itself, but that is user error, not a fault of the kitchen.   In short: go here, order the dumplings, get them fried. You can thank me later.",

    "text": "Background on Egg Soup Supper Club: We are (for the most part) white, American, Chinese speakers. The majority of us are ASU students. We are all between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. We meet once a week at a different Chinese restaurant around the Tempe/Chandler area for Chinese food.  _______________________________________________________________  China Magic Noodle House is some of the best Chinese food in the valley. The noodles are excellent, the broth is flavorful, and the dumplings () are as big as your hand. Literally. These things are HUGE.   The food comes out quickly, and is fairly generously portioned. Between the six of us, we ordered six kinds of noodles, ranging from stir fried (), to traditional noodle soup. I don't think anyone was dissatisfied with what they ordered.   We also got drinks. I think there were three milk teas with boba (), and a banana slush (). They were all very excellent. Well, I assume the milk teas were good. I had the banana slush. It was good, although usually with banana, they add milk instead of water for consistency. It was also very sugary. Not bad, by any means. It just wasn't quite what I was expecting.   The dumplings: We got pan fried (), as opposed to steamed (). They literally were 4 inches long and 3 inches around in the middle. The filling was very delicious, and they were perfectly cooked. They were not burnt, but they were not soggy. They were deliciously crunchy.   We also ordered the meat sticks (). They were basically little bites of heaven. One of our club members noted that she thought they should be spicier, but they everyone agreed that they were very flavorful, and cooked just right. No one regretted ordering them.  All in all, the food was VERY good, for a very decent price. I will definitely go again.  Note: The restaurant is mostly Asian customers. American customers will not be turned away, but like some reviewers said, they're not super nice if you don't speak Chinese.  Miscellaneous stats:  Number in attendance: 6 Cost per person: ~$14 Food: 9/10 Service: 6/10 Authentic: Yes.",

This place is all about the good. Fresh noodles.   The place is very casual and either you pick  a table or they will pick a table for you. The table already has a bunch of chop sticks and soup spoons stack on each table with paper napkins for your liking. The servers there speak mostly Chinese but can speak English. Sometimes you have to repeat yourself to make sure they got the order right.   I always order the seafood noodles with shrimp, squid, and fish balls. It has cabbage, carrots, onions. I have order the different noodle types. Usually order the normal or thick noodles but any noodles you order are always good. They have four or five different noodles you can choose from.   Oh yes, the pan fried dumplings are huge. It comes with eight in an order. They are so juicy and always cooked perfectly. I always have to order their dumplings. I think they are probably the best that I've found in Arizona or California. It's that good.   Overall, I love this noodle place and have no problem coming here all the time cause the noodles are so fresh. Yum yum. Enjoy",

It was also a lot of fun to watch them make the noodles through the big picture windows.  The portions are VERY large - definitely enough for left-overs - and the prices are very reasonable.  The food is good, but not necessarily special or memorable.  The appetizer menu is nicely diverse, but as far as main dishes go it is essentially a choose your meat and sauce kind of gig.  For my tastes it may have been a bit too salty, but hey some people are in to that sort of thing.  Health wise the food is probably 80% carbs (I mean the restaurant name has noodle in it so no surprise there right), 19% meat, and maybe 1% veg.  They do have a gluten-free option of rice noodles FYI.   TLDR: If you are looking to fill up the tank quick and cheap then give this place a try.  If you are looking for something more healthy or tasty then maybe keep driving ;-)",

They rapidly provide a small plate of side dish (steamed peanut and pickled daikon) right after we sit down, even though the water tastes really bad!

You can easily see the noodles being made through the window from the dining room, looks like fun :)  Had read about the pot stickers (aka dumplings) so ordered those and I have never seen dumplings this big before, full of delicious meat filling. Also got the green beans which were crisp and fresh cooked with garlic.  The Hong Kong buns are like having a little dessert before the meal, lightly fried pillows of dough dipped in a sweet sauce, so good.  For the main dish and trust me after all the other stuff hardly had room, but ordered the stir fried chicken and wide noodles.  Very tasty big portion.  Have enough leftovers for another full meal for 2!!!!",

    "text": "A nice sit down restaurant despite it not being anything fancy. I wasn't expecting too much when I went to dinner here with the boyfriend and his family. I did get excited when I saw that they hand make all their noodles here.   The menu is pretty extensive with a variety of different noodle dishes with \"less Americanized\" appetizers and veggies such as marinated pig ears, beef tendons, and yu choi. But that doesn't seem there isn't something for everyone. Their menu also lists the different types of noodles you can choose with your dish, along with a close up photo of each.   Since I'm normally not a huge noodle soup fan, I decided to go with #22 which is the Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. I LOVE minced pork so I thought it would be hard to go wrong with this dish. Andddd, I wasn't wrong. First off, the dish is HUGE. They definitely do not skimp out on the portions. It was a very filling two meals for me, and for only about $8! I recommend getting the thick noodles since they are so chewy and delicious. My boyfriend opted for the regular noodles since his friend mentioned that that was his usual order, but he didn't like it as much as mine. The noodles come with a generous topping of minced pork, slices of cucumber, and cabbage. It gets even better near the end with the collection of sauce on the bottom!   I also got to try #34 which is the Beef with Stir-Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce. Also very good and more like a chow mein dish. (So a good rec for someone who isn't used to eating different types of Chinese food).",

HUGE plate of food comes out.  We were going to order a couple of items, but the waitress said \"You can share one.\" And she was right. We ordered beef noodles and it was quite tasty.  The noodles are hand pulled and there is a window into the kitchen where you can watch. When he is not pulling noodles, he is watching the customer crowd. He seems to really enjoy that as he has a smile on his face.  The service was outstanding. Our appetizers and entree came out zippity fast! I noticed that for all the other customers that came after us that their orders came out super fast, too.  When you order, you pick what size of noodle you want in your dish. There is a picture in the menu with brief descriptions. I can't remember them all, but there were five selections from regular to thin to flat, to thick, etc. I wish the pictures were better so you could really tell better.  The prices are outrageously cheap for the quality and quantity that you get. My only beef was with the beef as it was a cheaper cut of beef. But I guess that just adds to the authenticity? :)",

Granted, this was only my second time here, and that's a big soon for a five-star rating, but I'll be duckfucked if this place doesn't make me smile in a big way.  For starters... they serve BOILED PEANUTS and daikon radish as soon as you sit down. Did you hear me?? I said:  THEY SERVE BOILED PEANUTS!! When's the last time you had some boiled peanuts!??! Have you EVER had boiled peanuts?? I know it's a Southern thing, but it's just one of those unexpected treats in life where you're like:  \"HOLY SHITSTEAM! This place serves one of my favourite foods without me even asking for me!!\"  Yeah.  So anyways- their noodles = I crave. Especially the 'hand-shaved' noodles (style E). THey just absorb whatever sauce they're in, and their texture is just MM MM MMM goodness.  Yeah. I'll shut up now, but I really have to say that you need to at least try this place. You owe it to yourself to try this place. And bring your mom.",

There were more bean sprouts, celery, and onions, than there were noodles. I could have boughten a pack of top ramen for 25 cents and made it taste better. I was so excited to try this place because of all the reviews on here but oh well!

Really, the worst part about this place is trying something new when all my favorites are so awesome. The pork dumplings, the pan fried noodles, and the beef soup are just heavenly.

The noodles (esp the shaved noodles) are still great, but the portions are smaller and the quality has just gone down.   On our latest trip, the husband decided to venture from our norms\\ and ordered the lemon beef noodles - which was really really.... interesting. Not terrible, just interesting. The beef is the cold sliced beef you get on those appetizer plates, and is bathed in a sweet-lemony sauce. It was alright. The saving grace was the shaved noodles we got. I basically ate this dish because I love the noodles.   We also ordered the combo seafood noodles with the thick round noodles. I think it was composed of maybe 4 super looooooong noodles and couple teeny pieces of shrimp, 3 miniscule baby scallops, and a couple slivers of octopus/squid. and a whole lotta celery and cabbage.   The best thing we ordered was the blistered long beans. Sigh.

    "text": "tldr; extremely rude service, slightly below average food   Had the worst experience here last night. We arrived at 9:05pm. Well aware of their closing time, and not wanting to be assholes, we decided to order Togo. The waiter came over, and asked us if we were ready after less than 30 seconds with the menu. When I asked him to please give us just another minute, he made a face, harrumphed, and said \"come on guys we are closing\". Fair enough, but I'm not ready to order. Please give me just another minute. Even more impatient now, he repeated \"no we are closing come on guys hurry up.\" I am a server myself, and I know the dismay of having a table walk in late. But the first rule of being a server is having common courtesy. After all, you are working for tips. After his rudeness we promptly left, at which the other waiter yelled thank you to us, thinking we were a happy, satisfied table who was leaving after their meal, as there were still SEVERAL other tables inside eating. Sorry to say that wasn't the case. Will never come here again.   Side note, I have been here twice before. Each time the service has always been typical small restaurant asian service. You sit, they bring you water, take your order, and bring you your bill. Nothing extraordinary and certainly nothing like where they are checking on you to make sure everything is okay. Being Chinese who grew up in the industry, this is the type of service I actually prefer when I go out to eat, simply because I don't want all the fuss. This last experience was on a whole new low. Aside from that, the food is alright. Nothing extraordinary. The broth tastes like msg and the noodles, both times, were underdone and slightly doughy. In China, there is one of these noodle stands on every single corner and they all blow this place out of the water. I kept wanting to see what these great reviews were about to see if they stood up to the challenge, but I guess I'm just the unlucky one.",

The vegetables and noodles were very salty. Vegetables were only cabbage and bean sprouts. The only reason this got two stars is the noodles were good.  Decor is basic- one step above school cafeteria.",

Fellow yelper Kevin H had the spicy pigs ears which proved that he is more adventurous at ear chewing than I am.

    "text": "The Magic Noodle was our first stop after getting off the plane for our AZ weekend and we were pleasantly surprised at how good the noodles were. In particular the \"seafood with cream sauce\" dish which sounds totally disgusting (and not much better looking) but was the best dish of the day. Of course, be sure to order all of your noodle dishes with the hand pulled noodle option.  Back to the seafood with cream sauce dish: I am not a fan of cream sauces. I hate alfredo, bechamel, etc. but this cream sauce was the BEST medium to bring out the natural sweetness and full bodied flavor of the hand pulled noodles. This cream sauce did not have any cheese in it and the seafood wasn't the highest quality either (just ignore the seafood). Our young waiter recommended this dish as the best of the house and my mom decided to give it a shot. No one touched the dish until we ate all the other food and were forced to acknowledge its presence.  Overwhelmingly, this dish became our favorite. Luckily it was generously sized so everyone got enough.  The hand pulled noodles were thinner than I expected, about ramen width sized and I enjoyed watching the noodle man smack and twist them into my order.  Something I could never do and the packaged stuff just doesn't compare. If you really want to appreciate the flavor and texture of these noodles, I highly recommend trying out the seafood cream dish.   Overall, this place is a bargain. Besides the above referenced dish, we had the oxtail noodle soup (not a lot of meat in it although the broth was delicious), stir fried noodles with XO sauce and a fried fish special. All were very good!  I always rate small hole-in-the-wall places solely by the food because service is usually dismal and this place was no different.",

It is as close as you can get, as far as the noodle.  As far as the soap base,  It is good enough for me.  The price is reasonable.  Beef noodle is around $7.30. I love Wonton noodles.  I have been buying them at the Lee Lee store or the 99 Ranch Market in LA.   After searching good wonton noodle for over 30 years iin the US, I found it in Las Vegas.  It is the Louie's Noodle Shop. You can google. It is a noodle factory.  Their noodles are not sold in Oriental Markets.   I freeze them because I buy over 10 pounds every time.  I defrost them and cook in boiling water in 15 seconds.  If you happen to be in Vegas, get a few bags and check them out.  You could have the best Wonton noodle soap at home.",

I have gotten a little bit of everything. Love their stir-fry noodle, I would say this is the perfect consistency and thickness for a noodle dish. I have tried their wide noodle and it is just too much, not to mention because it's so wide a smaller portion is served. When it gets cold it seizes up pretty bad and becomes unmanageable. I love their soups, however, I feel like their beef soup had shaved pieces of beef that have those clear almost tendon-like pieces of cartilage that are inedible and quite gross. However, a solution that I will try next time is to get the vegetable soup (which comes with an egg) and a side of steamed wonton so that they can be added to the soup. The wonton have the minced meat and are huge and soft. I love their egg rolls but I was disappointed that they don't have actual teapots of hot goodness to go with your meal. If you order hot tea they bring you individual huge mugs from some bread company in Atlanta(?). Anyway, I will keep coming back for the soup and the stir-fry noodles and maybe even some boba tea.",

You can customize your order if you like (i.e. add fried egg)  Handmade noodles are made at time of ordering. This is ever so apparent in the window to the kitchen where all the \"magic\" ;) happens.  All the noodle soups I've tried have been very good. So far the only broth I did not like was the chicken which I did my best to doctor up using the condiment carousel of soy sauce, vinegar, hot chili oil and sriracha. My favorite dish they make is noodles with minced pork sauce....I drool just thinking about it.  For my personal experience, dine in customer service was more enjoyable than take out customer service.  Don't forget that Lee Lee's market is in the same plaza so you can pop in there while you're in the area.  This one of a kind noodle place is definitely worth the drive across Valley!",

If you doubt that these noodles are hand-pulled, just look through the window into the kitchen and get a glimpse of the chefs freshly making your noodles for you.  This is a pretty authentic Chinese restaurant that had many dishes to choose from I was in the mood for noodle soups so that's what I went for. I ordered the beef noodle soup and was offered a choice of 5 different noodles. They all looked good but I went with Option E (knife-cut) and absolutely did not regret my decision. The noodles tasted extremely fresh and the soup was quite brothy. I did add some Siracha sauce for extra flavor but the soup was good on its own as well.",

Service was mediocre, but you expect that for a casual spot like that, esp considering the pricing.  We had to get up and get our own utensils a couple of times, and didn't get water refills quickly enough.  Food - dumplings came when we were almost done, which was odd.  Beef stew - flavor was great but we could not eat the beef.  Very odd scraps with fat/cartilage and veins.  Next time we will order the sliced beef.  Rest of the food was very flavorful, esp the beef stir fry, so we will definitely be back.",

I also ordered the seafood noodle soup and specified rice noodles.  The rice noodles were pretty bland, which was not the best choice for a dish with relatively delicately flavored seafood; but keep that in mind that this is one dish that was really meant to be made with wheat noodles (the default version of the dish), which would also have given the dish the proper chew texture. Nevertheless, the broth was tasty and I will remember to order the wheat noodles next time. The dining area itself very basic but spacious, service was efficient, and the offerings are pretty inexpensive.",

You can actually see them make the noodle through the window. The prices here are reasonable.   What I love about the X.O. Noodles are the spices and fresh noodles mainly. I am not really a big fan of the beef here it just taste slimy for some reason. They probably use some type of flour to make the beef wet and slimy. I think it would've taste better with hand cut steak.   The service here is great the food came out quickly and we got our water refilled before even having to ask. Good job on that!",

All three dishes came with a heaping mound of noodles and none of us finished.   Prices were great! $5.75-$9 for a ginormous serving.  Good service! Ladies were super helpful and nice.

Taste the broth and add more if needed.  After you've achieved perfection, sprinkle some white pepper on there.  It's so much better than ground black pepper.  Trust me.  Especially with the soup, they're pretty much handing you a blank canvas.  It's up to you to personalize it to suit your taste.  --------------------------------------  For those who like to order appetizers and have a little time between your first course and your main course:  In this restaurant, you have to be proactive.  You have to take the timing of your meal into your own hands.  Order your drinks and appetizers first, nothing else.  Wait until you finish your appetizers before you order your main course.  It usually comes out very quickly anyways.  If you order all of your food at the same time, most likely it will all come out at the same time.  --------------------------------------  This is just an update of my first review of China Magic.

    "text": "The menu at China Magic Noodle House represents the school of thought that if you're going to make just one thing, it's got to be good. They pretty much only serve one thing -- noodles.  Located in the Lee Lee shopping center in Chandler, the owners have done a great job of making the interior bright, clean and welcoming. Greeted with a smile, we were seated in the one of the generously sized booths, as if they knew about the feast we were going to order.  On the farthest wall a large window provides a view of the kitchen where the magic happens. After you place your order, you're welcome to go to the window and watch the noodle master go to work. Each order is hand pulled, something that's amazing to witness. I was put into a foodie-induced trance while he twisted and beat the dough. The noodle master makes it look so easy, but it takes a ton of practice and skill honing.  Wanting to attack the menu from all sides, we ordered a Chinese noodle feast. When the first dish arrived we knew we were in for a treat. The huge made-by-hand Pan Fried Dumpling ($4.95) was stuffed with seasoned minced pork. Alongside was a bowl of a vinegar-based dipping sauce, which brought a bright tang to each pork bite. I enjoyed the fact that the skin was thick since each bite was substantial and toothsome.  The Hot Spring Beef Tender ($4.50) was kind of a surprise when it arrived. My impression when ordering this dish was that it would be tender sliced beef, but when it arrived it was a plate full of paper-thin slices of spiced marinated beef tendon. I love beef tendon, so it wasn't much of a problem. Our waiter explained that the tendon is tender, and pointed out that the Marinated Beef ($4.50) was sliced beef.  There's a choice of five types of noodles, but we homed in on the hand-pulled version. They also offer wide noodles, shaved noodles, thick noodles and vegetable noodles.  Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce ($5.50) offered chewy bites studded with green onion and little pieces of ground pork. The noodles did a great job of absorbing all of the flavors of the dish. I'd order this one again.  Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce ($7.95) is similar to a house lo-mein, but this was bursting with taste. The Spicy XO Sauce added a salty and savory dimension to the noodles and tender beef that was indeed spicy, but not overly so. If you need additional spice there is a jar of red chile oil on every table.  I jumped at the chance to try their version of Homemade Lemonade ($2). Sweet and tangy, this is how good lemonade should be made. The Homemade Lemon Tea ($2) pretty much bests any other Arnold Palmer. Both drinks did a great job of cutting through the richness of the highly flavored noodle dishes.  Similar to Vietnamese pho, Ox-Tail with Soup Noodles ($5.95) were so comforting, I can imagine these on a cold day warming your belly and your soul. The broth was complex and each bite of fall-off-the-bone tender ox-tail and chewy noodles were a joy to slurp.  The only negative thing I can say about China Magic Noodle House is that they aren't closer to where I live, though on second thought, this might be a good thing.",

    "text": "This place is the best for noodles - hands down.  You'd pay three times this amount for noodles this delicious.  The noodles are not only made fresh, they're freshly hand-pulled before your eyes.  Watch through the glass window in the back of this small, no frills space as the noodles are stretched and pulled to the perfect thickness, then cooked up fresh to order.  Can't get noodles like this anywhere else in the state - the last time I had them was NYC's Chinatown, and I'm not convinced this place isn't better.  Make sure you remember to specify what type of noodles you want when you order:  handpulled are standard, but the shaved noodles are also a favorite of mine.  The shaved texture helps pull sauce into every nook and cranny - and the sauce is fantastic!  The XO sauce has great spice and flavor, the oyster sauce has a delicate sweetness, and the beef and lemon noodles' tangy, savory sauce - although unusual - has a strange addictive quality.  Although going just for the noodles is reason enough, don't miss the pig ears, either.  Served hot or cold and good either way, they are chewy, spicy, oily, and a great way to snack during the short wait for your food.  They pair nicely with the complimentary boiled peanuts.  You may also want an order of the dumplings, either steamed or pan fried.  While not the best dumplings in the Valley, an order is plentiful and not unsatisfying.  The dumplings' texture and flavor is great, but they are so plump and large that the seasoned meat flavor overpowers the dumpling.",

Everything was so fresh and awesome, and the service was so friendly!!! They have really nice people working here and helpful in suggesting what to eat.   Now, the fried rice did come out a bit bland....but, just add a little soy sauce and it's *perfect*. I actually prefer it when restaurants let you control the saltiness of your food, so that wasn't a big deal to me.   I'm so excited about this place!

We went there because we had read Howard Seftel, ( AZ Republic food critic) article about them on Feb. 19, 2014, and decided to try it.  It was horrible!  The two dishes he had recommended in his article were tried and ugh!  The cream sauce with seafood and corn was tasteless and was the consistently of milk. They brought each of our dishes separately and almost threw them on the table.  Tried the dumplings which were ok but not outstanding.  We did not really feel terrific after meal, AND will never go back or recommend it to anyone.",

I think six came in the order, so there is a bunch to share with your friends.  We also ordered marinated pig ear, cold. It was good, but you have to like that kinda chewy texture. Maybe just a novelty to try, but good nonetheless.  I ordered the seafood soup with wide noodles. The noodles were fantastic - firm and chewy and fresh. You can even watch the guys make the noodles by hand through the window in the kitchen. The soup was loaded with shrimp, scallops, fish balls (like chewy meatballs), and a few veggies here and there.   My dad got the standard beef lo-mein or some such thing - he enjoyed it (and had a ton left to bring home). My mom got the beef soup with the skinny noodles - she enjoyed it also, especially the noodles.  I will definitely be back to try more stuff on their menu. It was busy at lunch time, but we only had to wait for like 10 minutes. Well worth it!",

Service is quick, but the service itself is almost nonexistent but the most Asian restaurants are like that so I don't expect anything more or less.  I ordered the seafood noodle dish. The broth was tasty and the noodles had a great texture with chewy perfection.  The hubs had the lamb with noodles which he enjoyed and the toddler had the beef noodle soup.  All were pretty good.  We also ordered the pan fried dumplings and holy cow they were huge.  It was also very good and juicy.  Wish this place wasn't so far from our house because we'd frequent it very often.",

I love the vegetable stir fry noodles. They put lots of fresh, crisp veggies in there, including sprouts which I love. We ordered potstickers once and were taken aback at how big they were! Would love to see the addition of more vegetable options (eggplant, potato, beans, bok choy, green beans etc). I'd still give them 5 stars because as they are, everything is fresh and delicious :)",

I got a little nervous when we pulled up because the front isn't all that inviting (in a strip mall with a vacant tenant next door). We pressed on.  I'm really glad we did! Our 3 kids shared the chicken noodles (we chose the flat thick noodles, which was a great choice), and my husband and I shared the beef noodles... which was way better than the chicken. Both were good though. We also got the famous dumplings which were really delicious and huge.  Our food came super quick, which is awesome when you have little ones. We got the boba teas for desert and we were full and happy. We still had left overs, even with the two dishes and 1 app. Oh, and the bill was awesome, around $25. Can't beat quality food for that price. We had good quick service too. Totally happy, we'll be back :)",

Hand pulled noodles is like home made pasta, you can taste the freshness. maybe is not the best I had  but its solid 7.5 out of 10. So you get an idea.  For you people who have big appetite think one bowl is not enough but two is too much, you can add more noodles. What about meat lover? Yes! you are covered as well. Customize the way you wanted it, Go big or go home!  Few side notes: Quality of the meat are good, broth can use a little more flavors. under the cold cut meat (appetizers) they use some daikon radish to \"propped it up\" so don't act like \"OMG! that's so much food for what they charged\" Sorry! they are not giving you one pound of roasted beef for $7.95 (I am not even sure that's how much they charged). Overall its a legit Chinese noodle house.",

Now get your magically delicious noodle butts to the WESTSIDE!!!!  ***Original Review*** We saw this place when we were at Lee's having Bahn Mi and we decided we were gonna try this place next. I am SO GLAD WE DID! This place makes their own noodles on site and I have to say they are the absolute best! We started out with the fried dumplings. These things were so big they could be a meal in itself. They were filled with well seasoned pork and served with a tangy vinegar soy sauce. I have a hard time with dumplings because most places seem to have a weird taste to the pork. They are not that way here. Very fresh!!! I had the Noodles with minced pork and it was amazing! My husband had the pan fried noodles with beef and XO sauce. Both dishes we rediculous!!! The noodles were just out of this world! And the portions are extremely large!!! No complaints here, since we now had leftovers. And living in Glendale makes it quite the trip but a trip I am happy to make!",

Family style seating, clean orderly seating, open windows, and you can even see them cook in the kitchen from your table!   I ordered the hand pulled noodles with spicy noodle sauce and the pork pan-friend dumplings. I wasn't enthusiastic about what I got though. I think what I expected was more of a Southeast Asian style, but what I got was East Asian. I wasn't a fan of the noodles in the sauce, but knowing where it was coming from, I think it would be excellent for the right person. The dumplings were large and intense. Two could have been a meal easily and were great for a side or appetizer, the sauce was sour and complimented the dumplings well, but the dough was almost too heavy for me. Again, I was expecting something lighter, but knowing now what they are, I'll get them when the time is right, but probably will go with a HK style dumpling next time.  The soups looked incredible, and I believe that most people in the restaurant had soup ordered, so I'll come back again and get that immediately. Each table was stacked with everything you'd need to eat: chopsticks, soup spoons, napkins, Siracha, soy sauce, etc. It was such an efficient place and the waiting-staff was great. If one was with a customer, the other was right there to help me out!  Thank you CMNH! I'll see you again and try something new!",

    "text": "I was cranky on a Saturday morning and the only thing to pull me out of the funk was the promise of good Chinese food.  This place has been bookmarked for THREE YEARS and I finally pulled the trigger because - noodles.  We ordered the following: 1. Pan fried dumplings 2. Assorted cold meats 3. Oxtail noodle soup 4. Minced pork noodles  Quick tip - they have several different kinds of noodles here, but we didn't specify which type we wanted to they just defaulted with the skinny ramen-looking kind - such a shame and should be addressed with the order!  Certain dishes would definitely taste better with thicker noodles.   The appetizers were awesome.  Dumplings were huge and meaty and fried to perfection.  The assorted meats were well marinated.  Make sure you dip it in vinegar and chili oil.  YUMMM.  The noodles were unfortunately such a letdown.  They had great texture and I love that they made them in house.  The flavors, however..... ehhhhhhh.... sad.  If you're Chinese or Korean you know that zha jiang mian is one of the ultimate comfort foods.  Every household has a different way of making them but it's usually minced pork with either yellow or black soy bean paste as a base and garnished with cucumbers and sooooometimes cilantro (if you're adventurous).  My family has always added scrambled eggs in the sauce (highly recommended).  I took a bite of the minced pork noodles here and tasted NOTHING.  And for some reason Magic Noodle House garnishes this dish with iceberg lettuce...? Ick!  Why put that on anything?  Oxtail soup wasn't much better.  The broth was okay - but the oxtail was definitely not stewed long enough.  The soup had the teeniest pieces of oxtail and the meat was so rough.  Pass on this.   I usually judge a Chinese restaurant by how it compares to my mother's cooking.  This I couldn't even compare to mine.  Three stars because the service and appetizers were good, and the noodles had great consistency.  I wouldn't be back, though.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the Valley! The atmosphere is casual and unpretentious, the service attentive, and the food phenomenal and homey. Lots of parking spots in the strip mall too!  I've tried 4 types of noodles-- and they were all delicious. The thick noodles were my favorite, kind of like an udon noodle in thickness. The wide flat noodles were also superb, though a little hard to eat times because it was so long and wide. My s/o found the regular noodles yummy, but a little too long to handle (though I had no trouble with it). Because of this, I suggested he try the shaved noodles. He much preferred these because they were shorter noodles, but I found their texture a little off.   Noodles with minced pork sauce have been one of my favorite dishes since childhood, and though the ones at CMNH didn't blow my mind, they were solid and the best I've had in the US. The beef with fried noodles in XO Spicy Sauce didn't have a strong XO flavor, but was great, with lots of veggies.",

I give the place A-OK just because the noodle bowls didn't impress me much flavor wise. The saving grace was the fresh noodles made in house.",

We ordered egg rolls, pan fried dumplings, the Seafood (Shrimp, Scallops, Squid & Fishball) with Soup Noodles,  and Beef With Stir-Fried Noodles In Xo Spicy Sauce.  Everything was delicious but the order of served dishes was funky!  After just a few minutes they brought my son's soup, hot and steaming.  He thought he could wait until they delivered my noodle dish and of course our appetizers.  About ten minutes later out came my noodles, hot steamy and delicious.  Another 10 minutes and the eight huge dumplings were brought to the table.  We were finishing up our food and asked what happened to the egg rolls and they replied they were coming.  Five minutes later they brought the egg rolls which we ate as our dessert!  The food is too good not to return, but I will be sure to quarterback their delivery so I can eat in the appropriate order.",

You can choose what size and type of noodle you'll like and you can even watch them make it. The noodles can come with vegetables, meat, and either on a plate or as a soup.  We ordered The Beef Rib Noodle Bowl and The Beef Noodle with Oyster Sauce plate. Both were very delicious! I did however find the plate more flavorful than the bowl, so I recommend that one more.  The service was exceptional! A young woman helped us who had an incredible amount of patience and was very sweet. Also, our order did not take very long at all.  Also, the bathroom is gorgeous. It's gold leafed so definitely take a look at that.  I actually look forward to coming back very soon. I'm so happy that we have an authentic Chinese noodle house in the valley.",

Dip it in the sauce and it was comfort food at its finest!  I love how you can choose 4 different noodle thicknesses.  Go for A, the thinnest, for your noodle soup, go for B or C for stir fried noodles.  Their noodle soup was like pho but they don't call it that.  It was like chicken soup for the soul.  Their fried rice uses more sesame oil than soy sauce so it was a nice change.  It came with seafood, veggies and chicken.  The portions are generous.  We took some home and ate it all.

I discovered this place just by surfing online and when I learned that one of my Elite Yelp friends, on whose opinion I rely religiously, had given it a 5-star review I knew we had to try it as soon as possible.  My girlfriend and I were pleasantly greeted with a small plate of pickled daikon and boiled peanuts. We the shared a small order of Spicy Hot Pig Ear appetizer, Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce, and Ox Tail with Soup Noodles. The portion sizes for all the dishes was very generous and more than enough for the two of us.  The texture of the pig ear was delectably tender and satisfying and it was served at a perfect slightly warm temperature with just the right amount of spice. We ended up mixing some of slices of pig ear to both noodle dishes to add an extra dimension of yumminess, We ordered regular pulled noodles with the minced pork and shaved noodles with the ox tail and we thoroughly enjoyed the excellent consistency of both as we watched the chef pulling more noodles in the kitchen The soup broth was yummy with good depth of flavor, the ox tail was tender, and the minced pork was nicely seasoned, and the veggies were properly cooked.  My girlfriend, who is a native of mainland China, vouched for the authenticity of all the dishes. The service was prompt and courteous and the prices were reasonable. This restaurant is now on our list of favorites and we will definitely return.  Photo design by Billie Z.",

I enjoyed with noodles minced with pork! I even told my friend I was going to save some for dinner but I ended up eating the entire plate to myself. YUM!!   The portions are pretty huge too, enough to feed two per plate. We split the bill and it came out to $7 each -- not bad! =)",

    "text": "It's due time I write a review for this place.  I come here and pick up food twice a week.  Like others say about it, I crave it hours after I am done eating.  I always get the same thing because I love it.  The sliced beef soup.  I am not sure why.  I am not one to eat the same things all the time, however... this is my favorite meal of the past 6 months.  My wife loves the chicken stir fry.  Yesterday we tried the dumplings and they were splendid as well.   This place also always has a crowd.  It's not like Jong Wah where you're lucky to find one person dining in.  The family that runs the place is very friendly and accommodating.  They remember me and my son when we go in there.  Some conversation is struck up with the owner, he is a very nice man.  My son loves watching them make the noodles, they always smile and wave to him.  He also LOVES the smoothies.  SLICED BEEF TIP OF THE DAY Word of advice with the slice beef soup for take out... take all the noodles and put them in a bowl.  Spoon out all the veggies and beef (I also add a marinated egg every time) now you have a cup of broth.  Add one packet of soy sauce, a tsp of sirachi and half a ramekin of the homemade chili oil they give you.  Stir it up and pour over the noodles.  It will have a tiny kick but will not be over bearing.  Do not try this if you don't like spice.",

    "text": "I live about 1000 miles across town from this place, but was driving my husband to the Mesa Gateway Airport, which I swear was in western New Mexico and needed to take a detour here on the way home. I had heard and read so much about it plus I am a sucker for Asian food and noodles, so not really a choice.  I took some time to learn the menu, full of dozens of options plus LOTS of authentic Asian delicacies, such as pig ears and tendon (neither of which I fear) and after a recommendation from the waiter, settled on the ground pork in sauce (over noodles of course). The food literally hit my table in less than 5 minutes! It was hot and delicious and I got to watch them making noodles while I ate. There were so many combinations I would have like to have tried. Next time I have a few hours to kill, I will grab some friends or family to go with me so I can try more entrees by stealthily eating off their plates. If you are lucky enough to live near by, GO. NOW! And think of me...  PS: In multiple subsequent visits I would have to say you should not miss the XO sauce on either the wide or shaved noodles and the not to be missed dumplings, steamed or fried (though I think I preferred the steamed) are mind boggling in the amount of flavor packed into those puppies and the amount you get for the teeny price is incredible.",

Seriously, they're very good. If you go, you have to have their noodle dishes. My favorite noodle dish is the minced pork....so good! Also, idk why, but every time I go, I have to get the chicken teriyaki on a stick. So simple, yet so so good. I also always get one of their smoothies, usually with the tapioca or the coconut jello. Great place! You won't be disappointed.",

They were nice enough but they seat you,, get your drinks/food to you and that's IT. We aren't high maintenance so it wasn't a big deal for us but I can see this being an issue for others.   3 of us got soups with different width noodles. I ordered the same type of noodles as my husband but when received, my noodles looked at least twice the width as his. The broth was ho hum just not enough of a savory type flavor and the noodles bland and tasted doughy. There were a couple things that were good (like the potstickers YUM, teriyaki chicken, fried tofu) but the general feeling at the table was an ehhhhhhhh :/  My  family politely chatted about maybe trying other items next time but I felt like there was alot of disappointment around the table (not to mention leftovers that no one wanted to take home).

Take out is nice for the soups because the noodles come in a separate container from the broth, I usually keep some noodles in reserve and have used them to make my own stir fry noodle dish the next day or freeze them for later. The beef stew is my go to for the soups, but I also like the beef stir fry in spicy Xo sauce! We always get an order of the dumplings, they are huge and we always have left overs.   I overall would recommend this place, but as always it's not for everyone.

Nice job, and I will see you next time when I drive to Phoenix.",

I like that you can watch the chef make the noodles through the window. Because they're freshly made in house the noodles tend to be long, which I like.  The wait staff is very attentive too.

The ox-tail noodle soup hand-pulled noodles caught my eye.   My server was very polite and took my order and also bringing me some hot tea and water. The ambiance is very quaint and traditional looking like Chinese hole in the walls. I got my order and found it to be very delicious, authentic, and hearty. It definitely fulfilled what I was looking for.   As I paid for my check, I was told that my credit card wasn't working. It appeared that because my credit card had a chip, it was giving them trouble charging it. They asked me if I had any other forms of payment. I only had enough cash to cover my meal, but was only able to give a 5% tip with what I had. I apologized profusely and they told me genuinely that it was okay, and not to worry.   They are very kind, but I would recommend bringing cash just in case, or another credit card as backup. All in all, a great experience!",

This week, I mistakenly returned to this restaurant not knowing I had been in before until my order came and I remembered the taste of their broth. It is realllllllllly bland. But I notice their clientele is on the older side and maybe these older Asians prefer their soup on the more watery side (I've had asian soups that taste intentionally bland before) so I can't dock them completely because it didn't fit my taste. And their noodles are very good. They have a nice texture to them. But their lamb soup was just filled with bones and I felt rather shorted for my meal because I barely got any lamb meat to eat. And I had to work for my meat by sucking it off the bone, which was not easy! I did give them credit for hospitality tho because when I brought it to their attention, the server said he would bring me more meat. Sadly tho, the extra meat was just extra bones, so I was still extremely disappointed. I am now bookmarking this restaurant as a restaurant not to return to. But if you like bland soup with tasty noodles, I'd say come here and experience their noodles. I really want to give them 1-2 stars for food taste in my personal experience but feel that would not give them some credit for their hospitable service after serving me my gross (and dangerous!) food.

They were like a cross between buckwheat soba and pho noodles in texture.  I want them all the time.  Three of us had soup noodles.  You pick your sauce/topping, then one of five kinds of noodles to go with it.  All three soups were super, with not too salty, flavorful broths and lots of meat.  I only wish there were more vegetables in my soup, but I guess it's a Chinese thing.    We also got the spicy pig ears.  The large is a waaaay big plate, and they come with a little bit of pickled vegetable slaw too.  My first time, I think, having pig ear.  I don't know how to describe it... gelled?  Firm?  It's worth trying just because the texture is so different from other animal parts, and because it's an interesting animal part, but I probably won't get it again.  Too much meat for me.  Quick, tasty, cheap.  Not the healthiest though.",

I had the D noodles with beef.  Very bland.  With the chili oil and a little srirachi, it was ok, but still not a lot of flavor.  When I go back, I'm going to try one of the soups and get one of the stir fried noodle dishes to see if I just chose the wrong dish.  We also had the chilled spicy beef tendon which was ok, but not great.",

The noodles are really good, and the soups are pretty good too, although I am still not sure what exactly fish balls are. I recommend the sesame paste noodles if you aren't feeling too risky. If you are feeling risky, go for the fish balls and let me know how that goes.",

    "text": "Must have some Asian food....  Okay, I packed up the kids and headed for Lee Lee's Market.  As I turn into the parking lot I saw the Noodle House.  \"You guys want to have noodles for lunch?\"  I asked my niece, nephew and son.  \"Yes!\"  they replied.  Almost all kids love noodles.  I only know of one kid that does not like any type of noodle or pasta.   We were seated right away.  My niece informs me that the table smelled funky.  I had them re-wipe it once more.  Then out comes the boiled peanuts and sweet pickled daikon and carrots.  That explains it!  The vinegary pickled daikon is to blame.    There are poster sized pictures of the dishes on the walls in case you want to know how your dish should look like.  It's about 100 degrees and we felt like eating Ox tail soup and seafood soup ($5.75 each).  I asked for 3 extra bowls for sharing.    Hours of boiling soup bones lend to the beefy broth of the ox tail soup loaded with ramen, baby spinach and other greens.   Not much meat, but I really like the broth.  The seafood soup consisted of shrimp, bay scallops, fried fish balls, squid, ramen noodles, spinach and other greens and herbs.  The kids enjoyed their meals.  We'll be back to try the other dishes.  Awesome prices, too!",

They were even given a dough ball by the very nice chef to try their hand at it. Overall, quite impressed!  I would suggest the \"Hand-pulled\" noodles over the other variety.",

There was a nice balance of noodles, beef, and vegetables and the portion size was very generous (only 7.95!). We ordered egg rolls for an appetizer and they were your standard egg rolls with pork. The only thing I could give constructive feedback on was that the egg rolls came out after the noodles. The service was friendly and attentive and it was so much fun to watch the noodles being made in the kitchen. I think this will be my new go to carry out restaurant when I am craving chinese food. I definitely want to try the soup next time.",

    "text": "Just tried this place on Friday night for the 1st time...and loved it. Very much like the little noodle restaurants hidden on little side streets all over Hong Kong. Just a small dive eatery, basic tables and minimal decor, chopsticks and spoons sitting in holders on the table for patrons to get themselves. The clientele was heavily Asian when we were there...as every table looked to have at least one Asian person, lending a degree of authenticity to the place. The menu is minimal, maybe 40 items in total, including soups and appetizers, and split in to four primary sections: appetizers, \"special\" noodle dishes, soup noodles, and fried noodles. The noodles are made fresh for each dish, and after you order, you can watch the noodle guy making your noodles through a big window that separates the kitchen from the dining room. He pulls and stretches the dough, and 5 minutes later you're eating those noodles. Great noodles too! For soup, we had the fish ball soup, which is roundish, white balls of fish stuffed with a ground pork mix, and cooked in soup. Very good.  The first dish that came out was the shrimp with corn noodles in curry, and that was great. We simply devoured that dish. We also had the seafood noodle soup, and that was good. Not as full of flavor as the curry dish, but a nice, standard Asian soup. A nice feature was the amount of squid included in the soup, and the cuttlefish ball. Finally, we had #34 on the menu, the spicy beef with the XO sauce (though we actually substituted chicken for the beef), and it definitely has a little bit of chili powder and kick. Not extremely hot, but just enough spice to mix with the flavor to produce a great dish. The only thing I'd change is that they were pretty heavy on the amount of onions in the dish, but overrall great dish. Service was quick, efficient, tables are turned quickly, and food came out quickly. On top of that, the place is CHEAP! Most of the dishes are $5.95, at best, and several are under $5.",

We asked the server what kind of sauce was included with the fried tofu with we had ordered and waiters response was \"tofu sauce\". That's when we asked him why he was being so rude and he literally began to use vulgar language towards us in front of multiple families with small children.

When we sat down and looked at the menu, both of us were almost overwhelmed -- there's quite a bit to choose from and it all sounded so good.  We ordered the potstickers as an appetizer, and they were really yummy... and HUGE. I've never seen potstickers that size before. The noodle dishes we ordered were excellent. I got a beef/lemon noodle dish. He ordered noodles with a seafood blend. Really impressed with the quality of the food (and it helped that you can literally see the noodles being made right behind you in the kitchen). Our server told us to \"mix up\" the noodles right away so they wouldn't stick together, and that advice was appreciated.  We'll definitely go back.

This place reminds me of the Taiwanese delis that I used to go to in LA, as well as noodle houses that I've frequented in Taipei.  They have a great selection of cold noodle, hot noodle and soup noodle dishes. And, a variety of ways to have your noodles (I typically order the thick noodles or shaved noodles). There's always a veggie on the whiteboard to try and the fried tofu is very tender and tasty with the dipping sauce.  If you're looking for a reasonably priced, ethnically authentic meal in Phoenix (especially the East Valley), China Magic Noodle House should be near the top, if not first, on your list. the only negative that I would have about this place is that there isn't enough choices where chicken is the main protein.",

    "text": "I've finally found a decent, authentic Chinese place to replace two other Chinese restaurants that have gone waaay downhill (refer to my other reviews in case you're curious). Here are the things that I've had here:  1) Crispy tofu - 8 pieces of tofu fried to a nice, golden crisp with the texture of silk on the inside. Love the contrast of textures!  2) Crispy swai filet - again, fried to a golden crispy but with a little bit of kick from the jalapenos. Served over a bed of lettuce, which didn't really add much to the dish.  3) Minced pork noodle (shaved noodle) - I would say this was my favorite dish of everything I've ordered here so far. They did not skimp on the meat and it was not too wet nor dry. Sauce to noodle ratio was perfect. The noodle was al dente - just the way I like it!  4) Beef stir fry noodle - Personally, I didn't care too much for this dish. It was like a glorified version of the chow mein you would find at a typical Chinese buffet - only with a ton of bean sprouts at the bottom. If you're having trouble deciding between this or the minced pork noodle, definitely go with the minced pork noodle.  5) Pig ears - Yes, I can understand why non-Asians may find this a bit difficult to eat but personally, I love the texture of anything cartilaginous/tendinous. If that's your thing, this is definitely worth getting. They give you a LOT (with the exception of the biggest of appetites, you may want to share this with at least one other person) and it has just the right amount of kick without burning your tongue off.  Can't really say anything about the noodle soups, but that's certainly something I would try at my next visit here. Come here for some really good noodles, but just don't expect great service (then again, what authentic Chinese strip mall place would offer that anyway?). My general rule of thumb is - if the service is great, it likely ain't authentic Chinese!",

The steamed dumplings to start were ginormous! Beautiful flavor and done just right. From the menu you pick what you want and then your size of noodle. I got the seafood soup with wide noodles. Hot and fresh it arrived with so much parsley on the top it over took all of the soup flavor. Seafood was done right but no flavor whatsoever to the broth other then parsley. Next time I will considering ordering chicken or pork so the broth will have flavor. Make sure to bring your chopstick skills, not a fork in sight. (I'm sure if we asked we would have gotten one). Tables were slightly sticky.... all and all, good fresh food at a very reasonable price. AND you get to watch them make noodles!!!",

It was cool to watch the guy make the noodles, I had huge expectations but completely let down.  I wanted a soup so I ordered the oxtail soup (tasted like pho broth) with wide noodles. I should have been able to slurp the hell out of those noodles but I couldn't do squat! The noodles were extra chewy and soooooo long. I mean, I get it the noodles are made in house, but sheeeeesh this ain't lady and the tramp.  You can barely cut them with ur teeth, I promise u, this place is over rated for the noodles.  Oxtails------ total fail. This was super small slivers of oxtail. Don't expect much meat at all   The only thing that was super delish was the spicy pig ears. Yes, pig ears cuz I'm nasty like that!!!  It's sliced thinly and hot pan fried with chili oil and pretty darn good. It was so good we got another order to go for later.  Only thing is they pile it on top of some pickled veggies so it seems like you're getting a lot, but you're really not   Bottom line, if you're in the neighborhood and nothing else seems yummy, I guess try this place so u can say u had it.

I wasn't a fan of the dumplings , not any fault of China Magic Noodle; I just don't think Im a fan of dumplings haha..   The #34 was delish!

    "text": "I like this place. Each time I eat here I'm thankful Ryan K recommended CMNH to me years back. Ryan, hope you're doin' well on your unfolding Colorado adventure. Let's catch up soon ya big loser!  ANYWAY!  First, don't be scared away. Yeah, at first glance, it's a bit authentic for most Arizonan's comfort zone. Chin up, Imma get ya through. And it will be worth it for ya. We're talkin' lookin-back-years-later-in-fond-remembrance-of-a-life-changing-growth-experience type worth it.  5 Steps to Success. Do this:  1. Grab a seat. Under most circumstances you will be shown your seat with grace and a smile. Understand though, that CMNH isn't the type of place to fawn all over you with appreciation that you have arrived. If the seating is brusque just roll with it. It you find yourself having trouble \"rolling with it\", try \"getting over yourself\". One of those approaches should work for ya. Just remember, they aren't trying to offend you.   2. Order some Eggrolls. They're in the OK range of the eggroll quality spectrum. Just do it so you know for next time.  3. Order some Pan-fried dumplings. You could go Steamed, but I prefer, and recommend, the Pan-fried. They are made with Pork, Napa Cabbage, Happiness, and a smidgen of Blocks-Out-The-Freakin'-Sun. Seriously, these things are huge... and damn tasty. Dayum!  4. Order #34, Beef with Stir-Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce. It's not very spicy, relax. You'll need to give them a noodle type. I like the \"C\" Regular. Hard to go wrong with this choice, just go where ya want on this one. All the noodles are fantastic, hand-stretched on-premises, and undeniably chock-full-a-magic.  5. If feeling adventurous, pick something else off menu. Whatcha got to lose?  That's it. Give it a shot. No need to be intimidated.   Sometimes you just have to jump in. The water's just fine.  Branch out of your next visit. Yeah, I said your NEXT VISIT. That's how confident I am you'll be back.  CMNH tends to be my Pre-Lee-Lee's Supermarket go to. It keeps me from buying up the whole store when I go to Lee Lee's. ;)  Enjoy the Magic.",

    "text": "I'm happy to discover Magic Noodle exists. Moving to the area, I thought it might be difficult to find a Chinese place with decent noodle soups and homemade dumplings but I was wrong. Now China Magic Noodle isn't exactly the fanciest place, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I lend the five stars because the quality is great, and this cuisine with this level of quality is rare in these parts.   Obviously the most important part, the noodles, are homemade on the spot. There's a window into the kitchen where you can actually watch them roll and hand pull the noodles. Not only are they homemade but there are 5 different kinds depending on your preference for thickness and length. I had the beef noodle soup with shaved noodles and the broth was excellent, as were the homemade noodles. Truly well done.   We also ordered some dumplings which were also very good, but given the portion sizes there was no way we were finishing everything. The dumplings are huge! Great homemade wrappers and they come either steamed or fried.  You could probably share an order of these and be satisfied without having to order anything else.  The menu items are all priced very fairly, especially given the massive portions they dish out. If you order like two entrees and an appetizer, be prepared to take a bunch home or feel really uncomfortable at the end of the night.   Overall, I'm a bit biased because Chinese noodle soup is one of my favorite foods, and also hard to find, but I think Magic Noodle deserves recognition for its great homemade noodles and dumplings. They also offer some more traditional fried rices and noodle stir fries which are every bit as good, but if you're in the market for a nice Chinese noodle soup, this is your place.",

    "text": "I Have To Try This Again. Loved the Hand Pulled Noodles! Hated the Dumplings.\"  I visited China Magic Noodle House with mixed expectations, but an open mind. The reviews are on the spotty side, but I really wanted to try their hand pulled noodles.   Once I found the restaurant (on the back side of the building) I was immediately pointed to a nice booth by a smiling server and brought water and a menu. I had heard that the lemon tea was good, so I ordered it and settled in to consider the menu.  I had brought a few suggestions from the reviews I had read, and after some consideration, although I knew it was too much food, I decided on the dumplings (pot stickers) and the #34 XO Sauce Beef Noodle Stir Fry so that I could try more than one thing. I only had to wait a couple of minutes for the server to return with my lemon tea (wonderful!), and to take my order. When asked about the heat level of the heat of the XO sauce, the friendly server indicated that it was a little hot for her, but that they can tone it down to be sure it was not to hot for me. I agreed to that.  The dumplings came out first, and fairly quickly, but were a huge disappointment. They didn't look very good and I could tell without touching them that the wrap was dry. The wrap was tough, and where it wasn't tough it was hard. I initially tried to use chop sticks to pick one up, but it was large, heavy and awkwardly shaped. I tried to cut it with a fork I had been brought, but in was too hard to cut. I gave up and picked it up and took a bite. Even that was a bit of a challenge because along with the toughness of the wrap, the meat inside was very densely packed. I tried dipping it in the accompanying sauce, but it wouldn't absorb any of it. Granted, it was a large serving (8 dumplings) but inedible and not very tasty. I didn't even finish the first one. This was starting to look like a bad idea.  As I decided to give up on the first dumpling, my #34 was brought to my table. It smelled great, and was a HUGE portion. As I blended the ingredients together, it felt to me that the dish needed a bit more moisture to keep the ingredients from sticking together. I also realized that the noodles were extremely long and that I had forgotten to order them shaved (easier to eat), but that was my bad.   The dish was, however, delicious. The meat was tender and tasty, I really liked the noodles, and that they still had a slight chewiness. Per my request, the dish was spiced to a perfect heat level for me. The heat was present, but not overwhelming. My HUGE serving had a nice balance of noodles, meat, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. Eating the unshaved noodles was awkward, but I didn't let it slow me down. I only managed to eat about 1/3 of the dish.   I was provided take-out boxes and a plastic bag (helpful), and for what reason I don't know, I took even the awful dumplings with me. I later tossed the dumplings, but found the noodle dish reheated well in the microwave given several minutes at power level 4 in a covered microwave dish.  Overall, I'm glad I came and plan to return again because I loved the hand pulled noodles and lemon tea. I will not be having the dumplings. I still want to try the Ox Tail Soup, and the Noodles with Minced Pork.  I rated this as 4 stars instead of 3 because it is interesting to see the noodles made while you eat, my main dish was REALLY good, and I received prompt friendly service.",

I ended up tossing all of the salt and pepper flavor and ate plain shrimp because of the shell. Maybe you're supposed to eat the shell but I didn't found it appealing.",

Yes, right on Dobson and Warner is where all the my Asian peeps hangout - haha!  CMNH is both a specticle and an eatery.  The man behind the glass window stretches and spins noodle dough while you watch in amazment.  How does he do that!?  Needless to say, he is spinning your noodles up and around the air.    This time around I ordered the Stir Fry Noodles with spicy X.O. Sauce, while my bro ordered the Ox tail soup with noodles.  I must say my noodles were a tad bit hard, but I ordered the \"D\" noodles which were the large flat noodles.  I would recommend the spaghetti style since I think they would cook better.  With 5 different styles you can't lose!  My bro's Ox tail soup looked interesting, but he said it was OK at best so I'm going to have to take his word for it.    Overall, I really enjoyed the hand made noodles and the different ways they cook it up.  The best part is being able to watch them make the noodles.  For what you pay for I think it's awesome.  Some dishes start at $5 -- where else can you find that aside from Mc-d's! - Enjoy!",

It was such fun to watch noodles being made that I couldn't wait to bring Mom over so that she could see it herself.  Service was friendly and helpful, and the place (and restroom) looked very clean.  Really loved the egg rolls!  They're so good, I'm going to have to order them every time I visit.  The noodles were good, but the meat portion of this dish was pretty dismal-- the noodle to meat ration had to have been at least 3 to 1.  No exaggeration!  (I had hoped it was a fluke, but it wasn't-- more detail to come later.)  Once I'd exhausted the beef content (and there wasn't much), I wasn't satisfied enough w/ the noodle flavor to continue.  (If only the noodles were as tasty as those I'd tried at Saigon Bowl the night before...)  There was no doubt, however, that these noodles were freshly made--  I really enjoyed its texture!  Took Mom w/ me on my second visit.  Decided to try the steamed gyoza and a noodle dish w/ ground pork.  Wished I'd ordered the eggrolls, instead :(  The gyoza dish was, without question, the worst WE'D ever tried!  Too heavy on the batter, and steamed was definitely not the way to go.  (Once you have a look at the photos, you'll agree!)  Same thing w/ the pork.  Too crumbly and unexciting flavor (salty and lemony), and again, the meat to noodle ratio was very low.    Two visits, and it's Hit-1, Miss-1.  At least I'll know that the app will be a hit (egg rolls), and if I remember to order a double- or a triple-serving of meat, maybe the noodle portion won't be a miss...",

So you can only assume there is some history to what they are doing here and it shows in the food. I got the ox tail noodle bowl and pan fried dumplings. Both were delicious and decent portion sizes. I have seen some negative reviews about hospitality here, but it was not an issue for me. It definitely was not the over the top American family chain style restaurant service, but it was not bad service by any means.

We started with the Pig Ear and eggrolls as appies.  The eggrolls were pretty typical for a chinese restaurant, kinda blah.   I couldn't eat the pig ears, because, uh, I just wasn't in the mood for pig ears. Yeah, that's it.  Of course, the platter came to the table with a HEAPING serving of pig ears. We ordered a small, so I can't imagine what the large size looked like.   I had the spicy noodle with beef in XO sauce, and my guy had the spicy noodles (vegetarian).  The noodles had the perfect chew, and the sauce was really good. I would recommend the XO sauce, the spicy sauce was good, but the XO was just better.

I've tried their beef lo mein and chicken lo mein so far.  The seasoning is decent not overly salty maybe a tad too much oil but the star of the show is definitely the noodles.  I also had an order of dumplings and they were the best I've had in AZ.  The filling was seasoned just right.",

It would be great if they could add some veggies in there though. So you chose the type of noodle you want and then the flavor. The prices are super cheap and the service is fast. The portions are huge and I could have eaten the whole plate if I didn't stop myself. I am curious to know if they use MSG because it was that hard to stop eating.",

The noodles were tasty but i suggest cutting them a bit so its a little easier to eat.  What i happened to love the most out of our full order was the fried pot stickers and the sauce that came with it was amazing!! i cant wait to go back to order more of the pot stickers and try their boba smoothies and milk tea because i love GOOD boba spots worth going too.   upon arriving i could tell they seemed irritated i had come last minute. i personally am not a fan of staying later than what avg store hours are because i know how it feels.  But only thing was that it was probably half an hour before closing time! i understand you want to go home, everyone does! but to make me feel rushed is not a benefit to your establishment IMO.  I will give it another go one of these days but not just yet.",

We were greeted promptly with menus and a small dish of boiled peanuts and pickled cabbage. Our food came out very quick!  My son ordered a seafood soup that had a thick, round noodle. I selected the wide, flat noodle in the beef stir fry dish.  My meal was lovely...I tried to use the chopsticks but could not manipulate the heavy noodle with the sticks. The egg rolls we ordered were a bit dry and they did not 'wow' me...I cannot blame the restaurant because I am very picky about egg rolls and have only truly enjoyed them a few times dining out.  I was grateful to have leftovers for lunch the next day. Our service was prompt and the dining room was pleasant and clean. My son treated and he walked out the door paying exactly $20.00 and I left the tip.  I hope to return soon as I saw several selections that I want to try on my next visit.",

Every time I visit Arizona, I have to make a pilgrimage here. I don't care if the weather is blazing over 100 degrees in the summer or dropping down to 20 degrees in the winter desert; I just have to come and get my fix. The lady owner is super sweet and the waiters are also very attentive and nice. (Also if you're feeling under the weather and need some soup, this is such an ideal place.) Otherwise, for all the Cantonese people in the area who need their soup fix, this is it. Lastly, the food is very affordable, hence why I love this place!",

Not because I thought the magic noodles would make my cold go away... but because I had heard of the fresh, hand pulled noodles.  And those noodles were craziness - soft and chewy with great texture.  Who knew that the little man behind the window could stretch and slap the dough to create these fabulous noodles?  We also shared pan fried dumplings - huge dumplings with a savory filling.    My friends and I were pleased with the meal.  Nothing is better than a great bowl of noodle soup.  I know some people complained about the meat to noodle ratio.  Personally, if I'm eating noodle soup, I'm there for the noodles, so no complaints from me!  This place is a great value as well.  3 noodle dishes with 1 appetizer ~$25.  Happiness for your tummy without breaking the bank!",

Handmade noodles make a big difference, and you can literally watch the noodles being pulled here.  Shaven-style is my favorite, but there are plenty of other options to choose from.  The beef with spicy XO sauce was good - could have been a little more spicy though.  Jia Jia Mein here is also good.  Surprisingly, the restaurant is reasonably clean, which is unexpected for the typical small, strip-mall type chinese restaurants.  Prices are also reasonable and the service as decent.

The host was cordial, and willingly walked us through the menu explaining the different types of noodles and dishes.  We each ordered something different.  I had the shredded pork with shaved noodles...which are toothsome and tasty.  The sauce was full of flavor and it was hard to stop well after i was overfull.  Husband had a spicy dish with a thinner noodle.  He managed to eat it all!  Daughter had yet another noodle and another meat.  We enjoyed them all immensely.  Nice touches -- the pickled veggies they bring out to snack on while you wait for your dish, being able to watch the noodle maker through a window into the kitchen (he likes to wave at the kids), and great fruit smoothies.",

I've only been once, but I can't wait to go back!",

It makes their food experience more interesting and made for great table conversation.  The noodles are hand pulled so don't expect what you would get out of a package. There are inconsistencies in the noodles sizes and separation and that's what makes this place so awesome! it's amazing to watch the process and unique in our cookie cutter machine operated day and age. I felt like I was watching, wait for it...MAGIC! If you don't like thick noodles then be sure to order the thinnest option on the menu.   My opinion, yummy and worth taking the family!",

    "text": "Who doesn't like noodles?    While you can get noodle-based dishes almost anywhere, China Magic Noodle is special.  Theirs are hand-pulled to order, by someone I can only describe as a Magic Noodle Man.  From the window between the dining room and kitchen you can watch the stretching spinning process as they are created, just for you!  While I love the noodles (and I have tried four of the five varieties offered), the real attraction for me are the steamed dumplings.  They also have a pan-fried version, but I like the steamed ones better.  They are amazing - beautiful, huge, pork-filled packets of goodness.  I have at times skipped the other dishes entirely and just had dumplings - they are that good.  What would happen if that Magic Noodle Man decided to go on vacation?  Or realized that hand-pulling noodles was no longer his career calling?  I can tell you that for me, the world would be a little less Magic.",

Mine was so bland and the noodles too chewy. I had to add chile sauce and soy sauce to taste it. His tasted good, but was missing the beef. There was only one other table in the place and three people working in front, but nobody came to check on us until we were through and they all were engaged in their cell phones. One employee was even watching videos, and very well could've been on a break, but I didn't care to hear them. The magic noodles weren't enough to bring me back.",

The broth tastes good and tastes more or less what I expect it to taste like.  The hand pulled noodles are chewy (This is how noodles should taste) and matches the noodle soup perfectly without making it ever being soft and soggy.  The Pig Ears were also plentiful and packed into a nice small hill.  The price is a bit more than what I am used to, but it's a great restaurant and I will return again.",

The white sauce was akin to \"Campbell's Cream of\" soup. Our waiter was unfriendly and borderline rude.     Atmosphere was cold and unwelcoming, will definitely not be returning.",

    "text": "This place is kinda no-frills, but it deserves five stars because it is a tremendous value and a rare treat. I mean, it's all about the hand-pulled noodles, which makes any other pre-made pasta develop a severe inferiority complex. Enough anthropomorphizing the noodles though... the window into the kitchen to watch the noodles being made is such a cool feature! The dude I saw working the impossible noodle slinging had really impressive forearms... I'm sure he earned them from years and years of pasta wrangling.  This is the kind of under-celebrated hidden spot that is worth showing off... and picking up the tab will not hurt you dearly. I blew my roommate's mind by trotting this one out, although I had only been once a couple of years prior. What reminded me about this place was another friend raving about the potstickers. The pan-fried dumplings are huge... and essentially pure meat inside. The only \"filler\" is a smidge of green onion. Share these as an appetizer and then pound your delicious entree (I had #22 - noodles and minced pork). And then the Oompah-Loompahs can roll you out the door afterward, because my friend, you will be stuffed blissfully full with noodle goodness!  Do yourself a favor and pool your couch change. Then come down here to see the Asian Popeye whip your noodles from fresh dough. Get the fried dumplings as big as your fist! Stuff an ungodly pile of steaming pasta down yer gullet! But you might want to wear a bib, if you're hesitant to cut your luxuriously long noodles. The need to slurp them up is very strong indeed... and you know it's just that good when you soil your shirt.",

It's been a bit since I have been here and my memory is a bit fuzzy on the details but I do remember some amazing potstickers that were enormous and enough to make a meal out of at a fair price. I remember they were full of meat and the noodle case was not to thick but enough to hold things together when you cut into it and provide solid doughy goodness not the slimy sort found elsewhere.    Half the reason I'm doing this review is so I remind myself to come back with a group of friends to try some more of menu items and share an order of potstickers so I don't leave over stuffed.   I will be sure to update my review when I get back over there.",

Tucked in a strip-mall with a funny (yet somehow appropriate) name, this little humble place offers 'hand-pulled' noodles made all day (you can see through the window in to the kitchen where they are pulling the noodles.  Been here several times already and I must say, they are a) very friendly b) very quick  c) affordable for going a few times a week and... most importantly d) have tasty food. The atmosphere is mostly of asian families and couples, also enjoying their meal here.  I was impressed with our party of, yes, FIFTEEN co-workes (my idea!) who sloppily put together 2 round tables and 1 square so we could all fit and who were promptly served... it wasn't even a few minutes after I had said my order that I got my dish... the only bummer was that we all got our dishes super quick except for our boss (who actually paid for all of us! poor guy!).  They were apologetic and he's a nice guy, so it worked out.  Their tapioca milk is yummy and perfectly sweetened, too.  Like I said, this is a great spot if you're looking to fill your noodle cravings... I absolutely will be coming back.  PS: I would not recommend take-out of the noodle soups... did this and, though it was filing and such, it wasn't as flavorful that the noodles hadn't melded w/ the broth long enough.",

It's simply mesmerizing to watch. Not only was there prime window watching going on but the rest of the place was crazy busy too.

The regular sized noodles were huge (but not too big), I can't imagine how big any of the larger noodles are! The seafood soup had lots of seafood and a good variety. I like that they served the soup separately of the noodles and that I could add the amount of noodles to the soup as I wished. The serving was large enough to have a whole bowl leftover for the lunch the next day. I dare say it was even better the day after!  We also had an order of egg rolls, and spring rolls. I though the egg rolls a little bland and dry but the spring rolls were phenomenal! Highly recommended. Looking forward to trying more dishes.",

The lamb flavor was still very good, it was just not what I was hoping for. The broth on the hand was really yummy; normally  I'm the type of person that just eats the noodles and leaves the soup, but this time I kept wanting more of the broth.  The service here was really good, they were quick to take the order and patient in telling us about the different types of noodles. I love the boiled peanuts and pickled veggies the brought out for us to snack on, and they were kind enough to give us more when we were done. They also gave us sesame balls with red bean paste inside (complementary) to try as well.  We definitely be back again!",

I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, at least I thought. It's not the cuisine I usually pick to eat. However, this place is amazing. The flavors are on point.  My husband just kept saying over and over how good it was.  I definitely agree with him.  The noodle are delicious, the perfect chewy bite.  I had the noodles and beef in oyster sauce (18) and my husband had the beef with stir fried noodles in xo spicy sauce (34). We shared an order of pan fried dumplings. It came out to $27! Each dish was big enough to feed 2 people. You definitely get your money's worth here.  We both preferred the noodles with xo sauce.  It's advertised as spicy so we were apprehensive to order it, but it wasn't spicy at all. Our 5 year old even loved it. We will definitely be back.  They serve boba tea and juices too.

We opted for two of their noodle soups, oxtail and beef. Our waiter helped us choose regular noodles for the noodle soups. He said it pairs better and he was right. The broth was so smooth and full of deep flavor. It is a comfort food.   We also tried their pan fried noodles with XO sauce and it was really tasty. The noodles had perfect chewiness and the vegetables gave the dish perfect balance. It also had Chinese chili oil which gave it a nice kick.   As appetizer, we ordered the cold spicy beef tendons. Small is plenty to share as an appetizer. This dish was amazing. The pickled vegetables that came with the tendons gave a nice balance for the dish. Fried tofu appetizer was also nice. It came out piping hot almost burned my tongue, but enjoyed this dish and the sauce was perfect with the tofu.   Overall had great meal here. We came around 3 pm on a weekday and they still had lots of people eating here. I can't wait to go back! I probably order exactly same dishes again next time.",

Food & Service: Service is okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Food is good.  Order recommendations:  Spicy pig ear (cold dish) - it's pretty popular. Can't really feel any of the cartilage. Definitely give it a try for a new experience and don't let the name freak you out :) XO Sauce Noodles - I think this dish can satisfy any customer. It's like a stir fry beef noodle and u get to choose the type of noodle. I personally like noodle letter E.   I have been here twice now. First time I got the beef stew noodle soup which was great, but I think I really like the noodles with XO sauce one better. I would come back again to get my same order haha.",

I can definitely appreciate this place more now.  I had their potstickers which are clearly made \"in-house.\"  They had a nice sear to them and the wrapper was nice & thick with some bit/chew.  I tried their Noodles (style c) w/Minced Pork.  The noodles were very fresh and cooked well with some bit/chew as well.  The sauce was ok, not a lot of complexity but had flavor.  The service was ok.  Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad.  I could see coming back and trying other dishes in the future.",

They have other noodles dish, which i had only once a long time ago, it was ok, but I don't remember what i got the first time.   bottom line: they don't skimp on quantity of noodles. but if the overall dish is bland or just high sodium, the noodles does no good for me.  I suggest trying a different dish.   plenty of seating inside. parking lot outside.",

It's not the suavest-looking, spotlessly-clean interior here at the end of a Chandler strip mall next to the Lee-Lee Asian Market, but the taste of the food they serve is pretty incredible.  We ordered the pan-fried dumplings, and the #24 (beef and noodle soup) and #34 (beef and stir-fried noodles in spicy XO sauce). Portions were pretty big and perfect to share.   The noodles are made by hand when you order. There's a window where you can see them being tossed, pulled, stretched, wound, and cut to be cooked.   The flavor of the filling inside the dumplings was not at all like the likely frozen and re-heated dumplings at most asian restaurants. It was more savory, meatier and had a lot more depth. The texture of the fried dough on the outside and the softness of the inside of the dumplings is also unique. If I didn't know better, I'd say they were roasted instead of fried.   The noodles have the perfect chew and sublime al dente, it's hard to stop eating them, no matter how they're prepared. I did like the flavors they absorbed with the XO sauce and the hot chili oil, and would definitely recommend trying #34 if you visit.   I don't live anywhere near Chandler, but I'm looking for excuses to come back to China Magic real soon.",

    "text": "China Magic Noodle House is one of my favorite names of any restaurant ever. Tucked away in a corner of the plaza, the worst part of the China Magic Noodle House experience is decidedly the parking. Even so, you can usually find a spot pretty close to the entrance because it's fairly far from the Lee Lee's.   The first thing you should do for yourself after you sit down is order the dumplings. For real. They are gargantuan and hearty and wonderful. I prefer them pan-fried, but the steamed are also great. They are probably my favorite dumplings in the entire world. Strong words, I know. Another appetizer I'd recommend is the assorted marinated meat platter. I couldn't for the life of me identify which meats they are, but are served cold and are excellent, and come with pickled vegetables that pair perfectly.   Also highly recommended are any of the stir fry noodles. My personal favorite are the beef with XO sauce, because they are just the perfect amount of spicy, in my opinion. We also had the noodles with spicy sauce (a separate menu item) and would probably pass on those next time. They're good, but just don't hold a candle to the stir fried.   This place is great for a casual meal, and super affordable. Things come out quickly, so you can get in and out in a reasonable amount of time. If you're looking for an affordable, authentic Chinese meal (that consists almost entirely of various shades of brown foods), then look no further.",

    "text": "The first thing you might notice when you walk up to China Magic Noodle House (assuming you survived the horrible crush that is the Lee Lee's parking lot) is the cute caricature of man holding noodles painted on the window. Then you walk in and... HE DOES EXIST! There really is a man in the window that is hand stretching fresh egg noodles. This is real life people. My personal favorites are the cut noodles - they're a little thicker than the regular, and always have a bit of a chew to them that I love. If that's not your jam, they also come in regular, thick, narrow flat and wide flat. We always order the beef stir fry with spicy XO sauce. The dish itself isn't spicy in a mouth-burning way, but just plain savory and delicious. The sauce is a little on the salty/oily side, but I think the veggies and the thicker noodles help to balance it out. They do not skimp on the meat, either. The beef is the same as every other Chinese restaurant - exactly what kind of magic do they perform to get it that tender? On second though, I'm not sure that I want to know, but I'll definitely keep enjoying it.   Though the noodles are fantastic, the real star of this place are the dumplings! China Magic Dumpling House doesn't quite have the same ring to it, but I'd still be a loyal follower. Like the noodles, the outside of the dumpling (I don't know the technical term - wrapper? skin? dough?) is always perfectly cooked and has a nice bite to it. The pork mixture inside is SO delicious, definitely juicy and flavorful. My sister and I shared an order of 8 between the two of us and couldn't finish - these things are massive! Oh, and don't forget to load up on the chili oil on the table. Put that on EVERYTHING. I'm pretty sure it's the magic ingredient in the spicy XO stir fry, because that stuff is addictive. Somehow I always seem to lose all self control and willpower when I walk in here. But China Magic Noodle always satisfies by inner glutton, and I always walk/roll/waddle out of here a happy little dumpling myself.",

    "text": "I'm obsessed with Chinese Magic Noodle House. I have to admit, after growing up in Beijing and finding only decent hand-pulled noodle restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, I didn't have high hopes for Chinese food in the Phoenix area. Admittedly Chandler is a half hour's drive away, but I've happily made the trek three times in the past couple of weeks, and I definitely haven't been disappointed.   Located in a small strip mall, the restaurant is simple yet functional. The furniture may be a bit dated, but the food more than makes up for that. There is a little window where one of the cooks is hand-pulling large hunks of dough for the noodles, and that reminds me so much of similar displays in Beijing.  There are several options for which kinds of noodles customers would prefer, but I highly recommend the thick hand-pulled noodles for almost every dish. The noodles here are amazing, and I'm especially a fan of the noodle soups. The beef noodle soup is probably my favorite, followed by the ox tail noodle soup, dry tossed noodles with ground pork, and XO sauteed noodles with beef.   Beef noodle soup: This is a heavier soy sauce based noodle soup with large chunks of tender beef. I like that the soup is slightly saltier to allow for the flavor to permeate through the noodles, but not so salty that the broth is undrinkable. This is hands down my favorite preparation for the thick hand-cut noodles.  Ox tail noodle soup: This is a much lighter noodle soup when compared to the beef noodle soup, as the ox tail is sliced into thin pieces and the broth is clear. I thought that some of the cook on the ox tail was uneven, as there were pieces which were overly chewy and others that were tender. A good choice for when I'm hoping for a lighter broth, but I felt that the beef noodle soup was a hard one to beat.  Dry noodles with ground pork: This was a decently good dish, although the lettuce strips on the bottom instead of cucumber strips were a bit unconventional. The thicker noodles can be harder to navigate in this version, but they were still tasty. I could have used a bit more sauce, but the ground pork was seasoned well and paired nicely with the fragrant noodles.  Sauteed noodles with beef and XO sauce: I was so impressed that the thick noodles weren't overlooked or undercooked in this dish, as I've had so many versions where the noodles were mushy and falling apart. The XO sauce was a bit heavy for my taste, but I could tell that the wok breath was fragrant and ingredients timed well. This was a far step up from the stir-fried noodles at Cherryblossom Cafe in Phoenix.   Potstickers: These were huuuuge! I don't know if I've seen potstickers this big, and truthfully they were more of dumplings than anything else. I thought that with such thick wrappers and hand-made, these would probably have been better if prepared in the traditional boiling of dumplings; it's just hard to steam such large portions adequately through pan-frying. The flavor was still good, but I'd pick noodles over these potstickers without hesitation.  I'll be back soon!",

We usually order them because its $4 for 8 pieces, and its not the regular size you are use to, they are \"Super-sized.\" Don't waste your time with the boba, they are not prepared well.  We come here every week, because we get full off of a large bowl of noodles, for cheap! The average entree is at most $7-8 which I think is a great value for fresh noddles.",

    "text": "It's good to finally see a food place making hand pulled noodles. That is definitely one of the more artistic things around in cooking, using their hands to make different noodle thickness in less than 20secs.  This place is not that big, but decent size enough for a casual restaurant. I like their variety of soup noodles, stir fry and appetizers. For appetizers, they have my favorite marinated beef tendons. That's a nice dish, as it has some spice to it and nice and chewy. They also have some classic HK dishes like the mantou gok.  . As for the soup noodle, their bowl size is not the biggest, but the flavoring was pretty good. I liked the ox-tail soup with the hand pulled noodle.  Overall nice change to the chinese food scenery in Phoenix. Glad to see we are getting more LA style variety and not the cookie cutter dim sum places and chop suey.",

    "text": "I was intrigued by the reviews that indicated handmade noodles, and the storefront prominently advertises on its windows , Lanzhou-style hand-pulled noodles, so I stopped in before my usual Sunday night meeting, hoping to make it in time, ordering a starter of pan-fried dumplings and the XO sauce beef fried noodles with shaved noodles as others have recommended. This is a technique where the noodles are shaved from a block of dough, and it can be pretty theatrical, but, wasn't here for the theater tonight. Both dishes came out pretty quickly. The dumplings were a meal in and of themselves, lightly pan fried, stuffed with seasoned beef, but a bit dry, and served with a kind of vinaigrette-like dipping sauce: recommend using that and also a combination of the black vinegar, soy sauce, and hot chili oil as well to taste. The noodles were very good -- I've only Chicagoland's Katy's Dumpling House to compare against -- possessed of a springy al dente texture that is the hallmark of the hand-pulled noodle and very well seasoned, but a bit light on the beef. Nevertheless, a carbolicious meal. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "The China Magic Noodle House is down the street from my house. Since I couldn't think of any other place to grab lunch today, I thought I would check out the noodle house to see what all the fuss was about. What fuss am I referring to? This place was voted in the Phoenix New Times as one of the best places to get hand made noodles in 2010.   I'm not a small eater. I make it a point to try a few things on the menu to get an idea what the place is like. China Magic Noodle House offers more to customers than just noodles. That being said, my order consisted of 2 egg rolls, 8 steamed pork dumplings, and a bowl of beef with hand pulled noodles. To drink? Water. Gotta keep that palette cleansed.   After placing my order and waiting for about 10 minutes, all of my menu items appeared on my table steaming hot. The bowl consisted of sliced beef, cilantro, green onion, beef broth, and of course the hand pulled noodles. The bowls are huge and for $5.75, I was getting more than I was paying for. Not a bad thing! The flavor of the bowl was good. There was a little too much cilantro for my liking, but not enough for me to complain about. So, if you are NOT a fan of cilantro, beware. For me though, I like spice and I added two spoonfuls of chili oil with chili flakes to my bowl of beef and noodles. Just to ensure that I had enough spice, I added just a teaspoon of Sriracha sauce to the bowl. The broth stayed hot the entire time in the bowl and the hand stretched noodles were amazing. You can definitely tell the difference from their noodles verse the crap you buy in the store. You know what I am talking about!  The steamed dumplings were great as well. They served a mildly sweet sauce with the pork dumplings. Honestly, the dumplings on their own are amazing. All of the dumplings were about the size of a golf ball and definitely enough to fill you up.   Finally, I had the egg rolls. They were filled with pork and veggies and served with hot mustard and sweet & sour sauce. They were the best egg rolls I have had in a long time. My total bill for all of these items was $15 and some change.   I would definitely go back again. The food was great and the front of house staff were very nice and friendly. The China Magic Noodle House is tucked away in the Lee Lee Market Center on the southside of the property. I was very pleased with my experience and even more excited they are down the street from my house.",

    "text": "I came here based on the positive reviews. How is this place still operating?  I ordered the Beef Noodles w/Oyster Sauce. It tasted like something a college freshman put together in his dorm room. I was shocked that they were serving something like this in a restaurant.  The sauce was a thick gravy that was not characteristic of any type of cuisine I have ever tasted. It was sweet and very SALTY; it kind of tasted like a blend of soy sauce, mushrooms, and milk. Once again, I can't put my finger to it, but it was gross. The beef was extremely starchy and rubbery. I tried to cover the taste up with hot sauce, but that didn't work.  One of the ladies (probably the owner or a manager) was nice enough to replace it with their Beef Noodle Soup. This was not disgusting like the first dish, but did not taste good either. The broth was bland and tasted like boiled water with cilantro and a splash of soy sauce.  I left very unsatisfied. I hope readers will take my review seriously and not waste money there.",

    "text": "Pinch me... I must be dreaming!  A real hand-pulled noodle place here in the desert?  Wow... and it's not a mirage...! We visited on 2011-06-02 after yelping for restaurants nearby.... gotta say, this place will make you both happy and sad! Happy... Found the place... Sad... It's hidden around the corner from Lee Lee and we almost missed it... Happy... Watching the guy making hand-pulled noodles in the kitchen... Sad... Wish we'd ordered more variety to see how he does each... Happy... Good variety to choose from on the menu... Sad... can't decide... Happy... Really yummy, fresh noodles... Sad... I overate.... Happy... Each dish could easily feed 2 people... Sad... No leftovers to take home... Happy... Great prices for what you get... Sad... Cash preferred... Happy... Bright, clean interior of restaurant... Sad... the outside doesn't reflect the inside... Happy... There's now a real noodle house in the valley.... Sad... I live about 20 miles away.... Seriously... once you've had fresh hand-pulled noodles, you'll never be satisfied with dry-packaged noodles again.  The texture and taste is amazing.  We decided to try two preparations; a soup noodle (beef brisket), and a dry-style noodle (spicy beef with XO sauce).  We stayed with the one preparation (the pulled noodles) just to see how the noodles are under each preparation.  Verdict: Both rocked!   Okay, I know it's a noodle house, but as good as the noodles are, they need something to convey flavor... and this place delivers.  The noodle soup has a nicely flavored broth, chunks of brisket, and vegetables.  As others have stated, the ratio is about 3-1 in favor of noodles, but hey, it is a noodle house.  Oh yeah... it's a big bowl.  The spicy beef with XO sauce really stands out... the XO sauce wasn't very pronounced, but it was there.  It's a huge plate... and it's served in front of you (translation: you eat the whole thing).  It really can serve 2 people... I thought I'd take some leftovers home... but somehow, everything evaporated off my plate and I was somehow a bit heavier... it was just that good! The complimentary boiled peanuts and pickled carrot radish appetizer does wake up your taste buds.  Nice touch. Ambiance?  Hey, it's a chinese restaurant.... pretty austere... but it is clean, and it is fun to watch the guy through the kitchen window as he stands in front of the window and dazzles you with his noodle pulling skills... man, he is fast! Not ready to give it 5 stars yet... but mainly because I've eaten all over the world and have had some amazing food in a lot of cities... but this place is darn good and could compete in SanFran, Toronto, LA, and a few other asian centers known for good food.  I'll also reserve a star after a couple more visits when I try some of their other offerings....",

    "text": "This place is legit.   It's probably one of the few noodles houses in the Phoenix-area, unlike the myriad in California (which I so dearly miss).  I'm glad to see that the varieties of food are diversifying more and more now.  Anyways, grabbed lunch here with my mom earlier.  I got the zha jiang mian/noodles with minced pork sauce and my mom ordered the beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce.  The prices were relatively reasonable and the portions were generous, as you'll see from the pictures uploaded.  We both stuffed ourselves pretty well and still had leftovers to take home.  The dishes themselves were quite delicious, unlike anything else in Phoenix (at least in the East Valley).  The zha jiang mian/noodles with minced pork sauce wasn't too salty or overwhelming.  Just lots of thin noodles with ground pork with bits of garlic in a light brown sauce.  The dish was garnished with some green onions and raw cucumbers.  Definitely a good lighter dish.   The beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce was also quite appetizing, but a little on the oily side.  The waitress suggested we try the dish with the \"shave noodles\", which are hand-cut noodles that are wide, flat, and do not have a consistent shape unlike ordinary noodles.  The dish itself has a slight kick to it with some dried red chili peppers in it and contained a good helping of veggies and beef.  It even had a slight shiitake mushroom flavor to it, but there were no mushrooms to be found.  Either way, it was delicious.  Overall, my experience at this restaurant was pleasurable and I'd recommend it to anyone else looking to try a more authentic, less represented style of Chinese food here in the Valley.  *As an addendum: Food tends to come out quickly here so that is another big plus for this place.",

    "text": "I don't like to give places a 1 star review unless I have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience. I sort of had a combination of the two at China Magic Noodle House. I saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so I went ahead and bought it. I am always in the mood for noodles so I was excited to try this place, and it was right down the street from my house. So Sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch. I have been sitting on this experience for two days now and I feel that I am not giving a harsh review based on my experience.   We walk in around 3pm and there were only a few tables being served. The first thing that hits me is the smell of this place. My first thought was that it smelled like urine. I'm sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen, but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant. I should have turned right around and went home, but we stayed. So we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables. I still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles. It was a little weird. So I decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish, and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie. I see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well. There is a language barrier here with the waiters so when I asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought I was ordering them, but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian I think she finally understood what I was asking. So I was a little bit concerned about these.   Everything came out really fast. Like around 5 minutes fast. The spring rolls were vegetarian, but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. And the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all. A couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls. I didn't use either. How hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls? My noodles come out first and at first they look really good and I was excited. However as I am eating them I am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce. It tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty. I didn't finish it and when I asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce, neither of them could tell me. Which is concerning. I can't feel good going back to a place that can't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce. My husband liked his noodles, but he isn't as paranoid about what his food is made out of as I am. His smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at 7-11. I am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries. Sickeningly sweet as well.   About an hour later we are walking around Target and my stomach starts to burn. I feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days. I think there is some kind of issue with MSG here possibly. I don't know what else could have made me feel like that. I also didn't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt.   The only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant. Prices are also pretty cheap. Its cash preferred as well. Other than that, I am sorry to say I won't be back.",

The dish ordered with the handpulled meant I had to hold chopsticks high into the air trying to separate a portion of noodles out onto our plates.  Not bad but wasn't special... but the shaved noodles, loved the chewy texture.  I unashamedly used my baby godson as an excuse to get a mini noodle pulling show at the window.  I'm going to work my way thru the fresh fruit juice offerings...  I used to drink that daily while working as an expat in HK.  Speaking of which, the bathrooms are sooooo HK grand (Amy L, you and I think alike!)...  Overall the stir fried dishes were a bit greasy and the flavors decent, but the draw here is the shaved noodles (can I plug this anymore?!) and the fresh fruit juice.",

And ordered the #56 Salt and Pepper Shrimp.  Wasn't sure what to expect with that one, but it's basically tempura shrimp with sliced jalapenos on a bed of lettuce.  Good enough for me - I topped my noodles with the extra roughage from the shrimp and kept going.  I'd go on, but I really need another drink and something to keep my nose from running - it was nice and spicy, oh so worth it.  Will be going back to explore more options!",

After all they have a dude in the back tossing noodle up and down and slamming them on a large table. You can see him through the kitchen window.  The menu here has a large assortment of different types of both noodle sizes and shapes. You can basically pick the type of noodle you want and they will make one of their tasty dishes to your specifications.  Inside is very nice with all the condiments you need right at your table. Some of the tables are bigger and can suport those crazy noodle parties that can spontaneously erupt.  Started with the Pan Fried Dumplings with dipping sauce. The plate was gigantic and could be a meal just by itself. Ordered the Seafood Noodle Soup with one of the larger flat noodles. Both dishes were delightful and I really enjoyed getting to doctor them up with their homemade hot sauce.  So many different things on the menu with several choices of flavors and textures. This place is really fun and a delicious treat. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other items. Hear that the Spicy Pig Ear is also very good. No Pun intended.  Located in the same parking lot as Lee Lee's. See ya there next time. MAGIC TAKES THE SHOT ... SCORES!  4.5 STARS",

    "text": "What's magical about this place? It's the actual making of the noodles and its authenticity! Oodles of noodles!  The skilled chef and the art of noodle making can be seen in the back of the restaurant as you are eating. My fave dish is #22 minced pork noodles with julienned cucumber slices, on a bed of lettuce and sprinkled with scallions. You're able to select the type of noodle but I always go with the hand pulled noodles. It's a great take-out item. I've also tried the beef noodle stew with the hand pulled noodles. If you're dining in you will most likely be served with a plate of steamed peanuts lightly salted and de-shelled. Try picking it up with your chopsticks for those of you that are chopstick challenged. ;)  This place is awesome because it's considered a cheap eat! Who doesn't love that?",

What I like about this Chinese restaurant it's a noodle house that means all the noodles are fresh made here on site they come in different sizes and when ordering your food whether it's stirfried noodles or in your soup you pick the size of what type of noodles you'd like! I had the seafood noodle soup #27 for $7:35 it was delicious it was clean clear with plenty of shrimp scallops squid and fish balls! Wow!! Didn't know fish had balls! Anyway try it you'll like it very good!  Yea!",

The hand cut noodles are thick with a great chewy mouth feel. The pot stickers are fantastic, we get an extra to-go order every time. The orders are prepared quickly and it's fun to watch them through the kitchen window as they pull the noodles and the stir-fry flames up.  This place has authentic Chinese noodles and to me it's well worth the hour it takes to get there! I usually order a watermelon slush and drink it with a straw because I am used to it.

I had knife-sliced noodle (if it's what it's called in English... Anyways it's ) in lamb soup. The soup was just average.

The noodle master was the guy in the faded paint on the window in the front of the store, with the backward baseball cap. Just a short time after being voted Phoenix Best....It was Really awesome food.         I got to know everybody...Ate there 2 or even 3 times a week.....as time went by, the Noodle Master was gone, staff changed....food quality decreased, on Cristmas Eve 2017, went for some dumplings at around 7....told me \"we are out of food\"....I said its \"okay, you can make anything, were hungry\"....they said nope....no food for you, on Christmas Eve.      Went back alot less, over 2018....maybe once a month....honestly, the Dumplings were at one time, the best Dumplings I ever had. I lived near San Fran Chinatown....dim sum lunch on Saturdays...I lived near LA.....I have had some of the best dumplings on the west coast.             So here is why I'm writing this post, and why this restaraunt was EMPTY at 7:20 on a Friday night.  First, the star of the show is the Noodle Master behind the window, unfortunately...the window was Filthy Dirty.         I couldnt help but notice the noodle maker didn't wash his hands, and had touched his ear and his hair multiple times, and handled a cell phone in the kitchen. I do not know if this person washes his hands. The old Noodle Master washed his hands Every Time.        As I watched him make noodles, my eyes focused on the smashed outlet plate right below the filthy window, held on by Scotch Tape.         As I looked closer my eyes focused on the ceiling of the kitchen behind the Noodler with the blackest, greasiest ceiling tiles I have Ever seen in a restaraunt... Then I couldnt help notice the grease and dirt built up on everything in that kitchen. Just plain Filthy.   Then I looked at the dining room with the old and destroyed seat upholstery, and I couldn't help but think ..\"WOW...they don't care here anymore\"....      I got my bag, #22 and #5 ...the usual.....The guy put four staples on it. I already had a bad feeling about my food.      When I got home....I knew why. I can honestly say, these were the Worst Dumplings I have ever had...I never include photos...but I took two...one of the Dumplings, and the other of those same Dumplings in my trash can.      First....look at the older pictures of Dumplings from here.....thats how these used to look, what they gave me was Soaked in Grease, burned, to the point some had holes. These could not be classified as dumplings, and tasted so bad....I was really hungry, I wanted to eat them but couldn't. Just Nasty, Soggy, grease soaked un identifiable mushballs.              I am sad to see a Restaraunt just a couple years ago, my favorite, Best of Phoenix....now a shadow of what it was. I seen the owner roll in a Fat Benz....Sell the Benz and invest some money back in your Restaraunt before you loose it for good. I may Never be back. Ill be watching.  So Sad. Take a look at the 45 reviews not mentioned if you scroll down. My #22 had ZERO pork juice/gravy like it used too so the noodles had nothing to loosen them up and was just a starchy ball of clumped up noodle. Just a Massive disappointment compared to what the community used to love China Magic Noodle for. The charm is Gone in my opinion. Put some effort in.",

HIGHLY recommended along with the XO spicy beef plate. The hype is real. I was blown away. These noodles are no joke. The beef,  the sauce ..all just sooooo good. We got there at 11m on a fri, right when they open. By noon, place was absolutely packed. You choose the kinda noodles you want. There is a window where you can see the chef back there flinging around this wad of dough, making the noodles by hand. 5 stars. Don't order the corn dish.

I don't wanna hear the annoying vocal stylings of eminem when dining at a wonderful, highly-rated Chinese noodle restaurant.",

I've never actually had this before but I would definitely order again.  I also liked that it came with boiled peanuts on the side (something I used to eat as a kid).  Service is great and the price is definitely reasonable.  Will be back again!",

We got there at 12 right when the lunch crowd was coming in, we were greeted and seating. Service was very good, contrary to past reviews.  We ordered the Pan Fried Dumplings (8 in an order), Beef Tripe Noodle Soup with Wide Flat Noodles and the Beef Stew Noodle soup with Thick Noodles. The dumplings were big, though the dough was so very thick, tasteless and chewy and the meat inside was dry and I did not like the dipping sauce. The Beef Tripe Soup looked good when it arrived, again was a large portion, though the broth was tasteless/bland and the noodle texture was good but again tasteless. The tripe was good after I dipped each piece in Sriracha and soy sauce. Don't know what all the HYPE about this place is... SORRY  Atmosphere: typical Chinese restaurant, Service: good, Food: looks good but dull and bland",

    "text": "It was 8:30 pm when we stepped on in and it was still pretty busy. The girl working the front, quickly ran up to us, took us to a table, and dropped off the menus.   We were given water right away and it hadn't even been 5 minutes of us being there, and we were hastily asked what it was we were going to order.  After that I started to feel rushed and I felt like I had to order right away. There were three employees serving tables and they would all three glance at us as if to hurry up..  I ended up ordering a sliced beef noodle soup, an order of their fried dumplings, and we also got a sauteed chicken with noodles plate. All with their regular noodles. (You can pick what noodle type you'd like)  We found it pretty cool that they make their own noodles there on site. They have a window that allows you to see them making all the noodles which is nice.   Our food was brought out fast. The dumplings are HUGE. The dumplings themselves can be considered an entree. (no joke) We ended up sharing them and we were already kinda full when it was time to eat our main plates.  My soup was ok, nothing special. The broth lacked some flavor and I drenched it with soy sauce, chili oil, and siracha to make it taste better. The chicken noodle plate was super bland and it had no flavor. We didn't like it...  Service was ehh ok. We had all three different servers serving us.  Neither of them friendly. Our check finally came to the table and we ended up splitting it in half. The girl came around to pick them up and said she would be back.   I paid my bill in cash and was expecting my change back. I always tip servers at the table and so I of course expected my change to give her that and a few dollars more.. The girl never did come to the table to drop off my change. I'm guessing she just kept it for herself.   I didn't bother asking her for it because I was going to tip her anyways. Since she wanted to be greedy though, she ended up getting less then what I was gonna leave her..  rude.",

The delivery service called the restaurant and they did nothing, thankfully the delivery service took responsibility but because of this will not be returning. I understand mistakes happen but not even owning up to them is another story. Be wary of delivery from here!",

And honestly, fun to play with, since the noodles stretched on forever.   We ordered the steam dumplings, beef stew with noodles, and noodles with pork sauce. The steam dumplings were surprisingly huge and filling! Made with the same dough as the noodles, the dumpling wrapping was soft and hit my carb-craving stomach with a filling punch. :)  The noodle dishes were also good, you can never go wrong with their noodles! The beef stew was very flavorful; I enjoyed the feel of the stew with the spiced pieces of beef. As for the pork sauce noodles, they could have used more sauce.",

The soup has no flavor and the lamb is too salty. Well, that combination works quite well I guess but still, the whole bowl is rather flavorless to me  Service? The waitress gave us really little time to look at what we wanted to order. However, the food is served very fast. Making me wonder if they already prepped it before hand.   Price?

What she got was lettuce on the bottom of her plate with oyster sauce over it the beef prices mixed in the think noodles and diced up green onions.  She asked the waiter why they put lettuce, its pointless to have it. It gives it no flavor and she asked for a discount off her bill and they had no problem saying no, she said it's not what they are providing on the menu and she gladly said it's an old menu. For these reasons I would not receive this place or go back there again. It's was flavorless and not even close to how it looks on the menu. I would have rather spent our $25 at Panda Express instead",

Being in the Venetian and on the strip though the prices are high.  So when I heard about China Magic Noodle House I was very hopeful.  Looking at the menu the prices were great, very reasonable even cheap.  They did have a Beef Noodle Soup and a Beef Stew Noodle Soup.  Wasn't quite sure of the difference but neither were spicy.  All in all, I was pleased with the taste of the Beef Noodle Soup.  It had a good flavor not bland at all like some of the reviews suggested of their dishes.  I was disappointed I was not asked what type of noodle I wanted since they had a few to choose from I was not given the choice, I would have preferred the thicker noodle than what I got.  Also, putting some of the hot sauce from the table in the soup spiced it up quite a bit which made it that much better.  In the end it's no Noodle Asia but for a cheap bowl of Noodle Soup I would go back.  I would have given it 3.5 stars but they don't do halves so I rounded down since I didn't get to pick my noodle.",

I come from LA so I've definitely had better but after living out in Arizona for the past 5 weeks, I've been craving some authentic Chinese food.   The noodles are fresh and chewy. Soup base for the beef noodle can use improvements though. More pickled vegetables, please. And the vegetarian sesame noodles had nothing but sesame paste and noodles so it was a bit disappointing. Usually, I'ld expect cucumbers and carrots or something. The stewed beef cold dish was alright also. The drinks on the other hand are very good and sweet, just my liking. However, I wished they used real fruits for the smoothies rather than just flavored high fructose corn syrup. (total 3 stars)  So, for the pat on the back for opening one of the first authentic noodle house in Phoenix (+1 star).",

They did not speak a lick of English. The food was relative inexpensive, but then it was just some noodles with a few pieces of meat. Fresh noodles are very sticky and hard to eat if you allow it to sit. Will try the soup noddle dishes next, they looked better.",

I like the food, but some dishes are definitely better than others -- the noodles with lemon was not to my taste.  The big draw here is the fresh hand-pulled noodles.  It's a unique experience to watch them being made through a window into the kitchen.",

I ordered a noodle soup with beef. The noodles, I will agree, are very good. I'm so used to eating dehydrated noodles for years from a can or at restaurants. This was a treat. The meat quality was not great, in fact, the majority of my beef was just cartilage. But with noodles so good, I didn't look to having meat to distract me. I would definitely go back and try another dish, preferably vegetarian so that I can focus on the noodles again.",

    "text": "This place is right around the corner from my house but I had never noticed it. I saw the groupon for it and thought we should try it since my husband loves Asian noodle dishes and the groupon made it seem vegetarian friendly (I'm a vegetarian). I won't be back! I was really looking forward to trying the \"vegetarian vegetable and egg noodle soup\" which they advertised on the groupon. However there aren't any vegetarian soups and only TWO vegetarian dishes!! So I got the vegetarian spring rolls which were actually very good (although they came with a sauce packet) and the spicy vegetarian noodles. The noodles had cilantro and seaweed, which I think is the reason it smells and tastes \"fishy.\" at least I hope that is the reason! I did not like the seaweed and only ate a few bites of my noodles. The smell was really grossing me out. My husband said his dish was pretty good but he wasn't as excited about it as I had hoped. I was totally disappointed!! And yes we both got the hand pulled noodles which were supposed to be awesome but I didn't think they were anything special :( To top it off, no one refilled our waters the entire time we were there!",

    "text": "My friend and I went to China Magic Noodle after buying the Groupon deal. The place was nice with plenty of tables and the service was prompt. Our waiter was very helpful in picking out the right dishes for each of us.   We started with the Spring Rolls which, oddly enough, came out after our entrees. The Spring Rolls were a bit of a disappointment... a bit too greasy and kind of plain in taste.   I got the Fried Noodles with Beef and my friend got the Friend Noodles with Beef in Spicy XO sauce. Both dishes were very tasty and filling. We each went home with a to-go box of over half of the dish left. The noodles were good - I had never tried hand-made noodles before and was pleasantly surprised.   I also tried the Honey Peach drink. This was very good if a bit sweet. I will definitely try another flavor next time since they have 5+ flavors to choose from.   Note: China Noodle does accept credit cards, but they prefer cash.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "4.5 star for certain!    Man I really like this place.  I dined there for the first time with my family this evening and none of us were disappointed at all.  The noodles are very good and have a lot of texture to them.  The broth that they used in the soups was very flavorful but not greasy or oily.  It felt really healthy and fresh.  The cooks were making noodles in the back and it is very entertaining to watch.  There smoothies are freaking wonderful!  I would however shy away from the tapioca balls unless you know you like them.  They are pretty gummy and do not dissipate or melt in your mouth like I expected.  . We also had an order of pan fried pot stickers which is one of my favorites and these were the best I have ever eaten.  The dough was perfect, light, crispy, yet moist.  The filling was very meaty and had nice flavors of lemongrass and ginger.  The sauce was excellent as well - lighter than most butt this is good in this case.    I am very excited to have found my new lunch and dinner place.  The bill for a family of four was $40 and that included three smoothies, four entrees, and a large app of pot stickers.    The setting in the only drawback but as a foodie I do not go to places often for ambiance.  It is clean and the kitchen is visibly clean as well which is great to see. The service was efficient and and prompt.  I swear they will get you your food faster than Mc-E-D's which just adds to the place when dining for lunch when you only have an hour to burn.  Go, and enjoy it!",

    "text": "OK, I'm somewhat between 3 stars and 4 stars on this.  I really want to like this restaurant a lot so maybe I will have to return again and try another dish.  Positives:  Price!!!!  Wow, the prices are amazing.  I got the hand pulled spicy noodle dish ($4.00), my boyfriend got the hand pulled pork noodles ($5.95) and we shared the pork dumplings ($4.95).  The dishes provided rather generous portions (we ended up taking half of our meals to go).    The dumplings were quite tasty (approx 8 large dumplings)  I got the passion fruit smoothie with boba which was quite good (I love bubble tea so much and this place is pretty legit).  The restaurant was really clean and the window to watch the noodles being made was really interesting and ingenious!  Negatives:  My noodle dish just really didn't have a whole lot of flavor and was not even remotely spicy for being titled 'spicy noodles.'    All of the food was really rather greasy.  The sauce for the noodles was pretty much pure oil and the dumplings/sauce were pretty oily too (but still tasty).  I was just hoping for a bit of a cleaner feeling meal instead of heavy greasy food.  Maybe if I try one of the soup dishes next time I will have better luck!    The experience was overall a good one and I would like to try this place again, I was just a bit disappointed with the grease content of the foods which gave me a bit of stomach ache.  Regardless, this place is worth a shot!",

I had the Beef Stew Noodle Soup with a marinated egg and mom had Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce. Mine was really good, the broth was tasty and noodles were chewy.  They were very generous on the amount of beef stew in the bowl! Just the marinated egg was kinda cold, wish it could be warmer. Mom really liked hers as well, the sauce was really tasty, and the portion is BIG. And the price is really good!!! It's $13 for both of us including tax!  Why are the noodles so good? They really make their noodles on site,  you can see how the chef hand-pulls the noodles through the window in the inner side of the lobby. Also, the restaurant is next the Lee Lee's supermarket, very convenient for majority Asians who go their for groceries.",

    "text": "I went here with my husband on our date night and I must say, the noodles are delicious.  The texture had a nice bite to it, but not too al dente.  I had their beef noodle soup and my husband had their vegetable and beef fried noodles (lo mein).  Both were very good.  Best noodles I have had in AZ, hands down.  They only make one kind of noodle, but you can choose from a variety of shapes.    A warning however to those who have an aversion to certain meat sinew.  The beef that came in the my beef noodle soup came from, I believe, some cut of rib, straight off the bone.  So, although the beef was nice an tender, there were some pieces of sinew that were attached to most of my pieces of meat.  They were mostly tender, but some were a bit chewy.  Some people, like myself, actually enjoy eating these pieces of meat, but for those of you who don't, you might want to order a different kind of noodle soup.      We also ordered the pork steamed dumplings and the beef stick.I was not a big fan of the beef stick.  I think the cut of beef they use for the beef stick is not ideal for that type of treatment.  It was overdone, tough, and I wasn't too into the sauce.  I can't quite describe it except that it was a light soy sauce marinade, on the slightly sweet side, with little to no depth.    The steam dumplings were okay.  The dumpling skin is not typical; thin and delicate.  Simply based on the skin, they were very \"hearty\" dumplings.  I think they may use the same or similar dough recipe for their dumpling skins as with their noodles.  The filling was okay.  A bit on the mushy side for me and the sauce that they serve with it is lighter in terms of sweetness than most sweet and sour sauces.    The staff is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable.  Like my husband said, \"any time I am in the mood for some noodles [Chinese wheat noodles specifically] I am coming here.\"",

You can get them without the 'boba' for those who has an aversion to tapioca pearls.  The milk tea one was a bit on the sweet side but it was still good.  The dumplings were VERY VERY good.  I haven't had anything better in Phoenix.  Even thought it's under the appetizer category, these dumplings (8 of them for $5) were humongous!  Not only were they huge, the dough was home made.  Very chewy and fresh.  They were the best I've had in restaurants in many years!  They were so good that we ordered 'to-go' order for the dumplings!   The noodle soups were really tasty too.  I think for noodle lovers, this place would be heaven (at least in Phoenix).  The home made noodles are very fresh, chewy, and oh so tasty!!!!    You can also see how they make the noodle through the window inside the restaurant.  The place is a simple table/chairs and booths.  It seemed as the place ran on swamp cooler so it was a bit humid inside......not a big fan of that but the food made up for a bit of uncomfortable stickiness.  I'm looking forward to going back there again to try other noodles!",

Whichever dish you order you will taste the same consistency in the noodles!  Comes in various shape, style and sizes! You can order it soupy, brothy or stir-fry!  I had the minced pork dish and a taste of a seafood and beef stir-fry.  Overall great tasting flavors! Most Chinese joints is about the sauce, here it's the opposite, it's the noodles! When you take your first five bites, you almost forget about the other ingredients! It's that yummy!  I also ordered the pan-fried, dumplings! Delicious! I assume they used the same dough to make them!  It's situated in an Asian mecca of Chandler, so do not be surprised if you see many Asians around.  Its True per other reviews and pics, you get to witness one of the cooks twirl and toss around the fresh dough behind a glass window!  I plan to return for more magical goodness, next time, I will try  the broth/soup style!",

    "text": "Been here twice now.  Was introduced to it by a coworker when we decdied to take a bit of extra time for lunch one day.  First thing I tried was the seafood with corn, and was happy to find the noodles were tasty and stretchy; there is a big difference between this and buying them dry at the store.  And, yes, it is a completely different texture than what most people here are used to.  They are Chinese noodles after all, and not pasta.  The dish as a whole was good, even though they used imitation crab, which I usually avoid.  The fact I enjoyed it regardless is saying something.  I also stole both some of the steamed and fried dumplings from my lunchmates, and both were great, although I prefer the fried.    Second visit I went for the seafood noodles and, this time, it was straight up what I love: fish balls, shrimp, squid and scallops, all cooked perfectly in a flavorful sauce.  Also ordered the spicy pig ear, which was quite good, even though the portions are a bit much for an appetizer.  My wife enjoyed her beef noodles with oyster sauce, and I also sampled from my friend's \"mixed meat\" platter (largely marinated beef and pig ears).    All-in-all a great place so far, and it's nice to have an Asian place to eat again that's not a buffet.",

    "text": "We all have those iconic food moments in our lives and one of mine was in a small noodle shop off the Hibaya subway line in Tokyo where they made noodles by hand, scraping noddles off a huge block of dough, with a pastry scraper, into a large wok of boiling water with huge clouds of steam rising up into the cooking area (they also made one hell of a pan fried Gyoza that I still dream about), and I've spent the last two years thinking how great to have a place like it in Phoenix.   Well, wishes do come True because I was flipping through the 2010 best of Phoenix from New Times earlier this week and China Magic Noodle House was in there as a place to try so today, after watching the early screening of the movie Social Networking, I headed over to Chandler to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised to see it in the same shopping center as Lee Lee's, an Asian market that people have been telling me to check out for ages.  Well, I walk in and a fairly large space with plenty of tables. The menu had several types of noodles and through a glass window in the back you can see cooks making fresh noodles. I chose the scraped noodles with minced pork since that seemed the closest to what I had in Japan. I also noticed that they had a variety of fresh fruit drinks (included a special of watermelon for $2), but stuck with water so I could focus on the noodles. The ones that came out were scraped and somewhat longer than the ones I had in Tokyo and they seemed a bit drier as well, though when I mixed up the bowl there was some great pork broth, along with shredded lettuce. I added some hot chili paste that was provided on the table and a splash or two of soy sauce, did another mix, and well, started eating.  Okay, different from the noodles in Tokyo but...I had one of those great food experiences where you sort of zone out a bit because you enjoy what you are eating so much. Something about the fresh made noodles, the flavorful mix of pork meat and broth, and the slight bite of the chili paste was, as we say in Hawaii, Ono (good)! I don't know if I am willing to say I love the place yet but from a first try, I am definitely a fan. The best part, after the meal you can go cruise around in Lee Lee's for a bit and see specialty food items from just about every Asian culture you can imagine. Next time I go to the noodle shop I'll try the soup noodles - the soup noodles with lamb is on my radar! All I can say, I hope they expand and open a place in Tempe. Their food is inexpensive, fresh, and tasty, perfect for college students.",

All the noodles are handmade fresh, and they are delicious!  Cooked just right, and you can even watch as they are being made.  They let you choose the type of noodle you want with your dish.  My favorite so far are the thick noodles.  Similar to udon noodles.  Their steamed dumplings are HUGE (and also handmade) and are probably the best I've ever had.  The staff is very friendly.  No complaints at all about this place.    My most recent time, I got the spicy beef stir fry.  The beef was tender and seasoned perfectly.  And of course, the noodles were excellent.   My one suggestion is that if you are with a big group, do carry out instead.  It's a very small location and you might be in for a long wait if you're with a large group.  Just make sure you try it!

The soups are flavorful and refreshing (and clean!), the meat tender, and its fun trying the same soup but with a different noodle type!  And man those peanuts are addicting!  They also make boba/juice drinks and have a variety of appetizers.  If you can get past what it is, their pig ears are exceptional and come in a pretty decent-sized portion.

The peanuts and veg were meh.    We ordered the egg roll appetizer.  They served it piping hot with to go packets of \"duck sauce\" and \"hot mustard\". I expect more from a place with hand pulled noodles. They should really take the time to make their own sauces. Which more or less was a foreshadowing of things to come. The rolls themselves were good but greasy.  Our drinks were brought out quickly. Boba Milk Tea for me, iced tea for my husband. (Which I later had to ask to be refilled. Yes, one more please).  Our entrees soon followed. Both dishes were cheap, hot, and heaping. As with many Asian places, they provide condiments for you to customize your food. This tray had hot chili oil, vinegar, soy, and sriracha sauce.  The food itself was rather bland though.  It needed doctoring.  I wish they had added more flavor at the beginning during cooking.  We ended up taking about half of our food home. I reheated in a pan with some stir fry sauce and a little fish sauce. Much better.  We probably won't be back. I'd rather spend my money on a lot more flavor.",

The restaurant is pretty much standard Chinese hole-in-the-wall...nothing remarkable.  It wasn't packed but had a good lunch crowd there.  The waitress was also nice & polite and came by a couple of times to see if we were ready to order (since it was our first time, we didn't immediately know what we wanted upon arriving).  When ordering noodles, they have a list of about 5-6 different types of noodles...first you pick your noodles, then you pick how you wanted it prepped...pretty neat.  I got the beef stew w/the wide noodles and it was so wide I had a hard time eating it.  Each noodle strand was almost an inch wide so it wasn't easy trying to stick it all in my mouth.  I should have stayed w/my original thought of getting the hand pulled noodle...and will get it the next time I'm there.  Although the wide noodle was slightly difficult for me to eat, the beef stew & the pickled greens that came w/it were really good.  I also had the boba milk tea and it was okay.  Complete lunch for me came out to ~$10...I was a happy camper  :)  There are also several vegetarian options so our vegan friends weren't left hungry.  Our friends' vegetarian noodle plates came out to only $4/each...what a deal!  They felt their meal was very satisfying and we shall be back.",

I had heard about the fresh noodles stretched by hand in a window for diners viewing pleasure...sounds like a rare gem of a place and in a few ways it is! The problem is the physical experience while you are in the restaurant. It's just plain ugly. You feel like you can't trust the food that is about to come your way. The paradox is that the food is really good and for the price, it's excellent! We had the Pan Fried pork dumplings and they were enormous, tender and very well seasoned. The dipping sauce was almost unnecessary, they were that good! The Beef and Pan fried noodles with XO Sauce was REALLY good! Spicy, flavorful, tender beef and their special soft noodles. I think this will be our take out special place from now on.",

The decor is typical little-Phoenix-strip-mall, but the environment is NOT why you come to a place like this!  I like noodle dishes where you can actually taste the noodles...can't go wrong with the beef chow fun.  I am excited to return to try some of the other noodle dishes.",

    "text": "Finally, an authentic Asian noodle house in town, I really hope they stick around for a long time.  I wouldn't see any problem if the line of people continue standing out the door waiting for a table on a Saturday night.  I had ordered their pan fried dumplings, but somehow they came out steamed. I had to request to take it back.  I normally don't like to refuse food; you never know what you end up.   As for the noodle dishes, the shaved noodles were okay, it wasn't what I expected.  I was thinking of thinker noodle in ball shapes instead of long strips.  It was sort of difficult to eat.  The beef noodle with lemon topped with garlic was delicious according to my Sis-in-Law.  It just doesn't look like an Asian dish.  The noodle with Minced Pork was the best.  However, I wish they had cut the noodles so it would be easier to pull by using the chopstick.  The beef tripe noodle soup wasn't bad either.  One thing is that they actually ran out of wontons.  WHAT?  Wonton and noodle are like bacon and egg.  How can you run out at a noodle house?  As for the service, we had friendly waitress, but very forgetful.  If you want to sit and enjoy a long meal, don't come on a Saturday night.  I felt the wait staff was rushing us out after we paid.  I know there are people waiting, but you can't rush people out like we didn't pay.  I didn't even get to finish my dumplings.  Boo Hoo!  I thought the guy making the noodles deserve more tips as he was entertaining the kids. Great babysitter as the parent dines.",

    "text": "I'm not easy to please, in fact I'm quite picky when it comes to food, but I have to give this restaurant 5 stars.    I could easily go for some China Magic right now, and I'm not even hungry!  This is a great little restaurant in an area full of tasty places to eat.  Kind of an Asian enclave in Mesa, near the great Asian grocery store, Lee Lee's.  This place faces Warner road and is directly across the street from the fantastic Lee Sandwiches, possibly the best (maybe only?) Vietnamese/French bakery in the area.   But back to some China Magic, my friends.  Why do I like this place?  First of all the restaurant is clean and welcoming, which is essential.  I don't care how good the food is if the place is skanky, sorry.  Friendly and quick service.  Inexpensive.  They give you little dishes of boiled peanuts and pickled daikon and carrot before your meal.  I haven't worked out if these are appetizers or condiments, but who cares?  They are tasty!   Home-made noodles.  Have I got you yet?  HOME-MADE NOODLES.  The food is very basic, nothing crazy.  Delightful and satisfying, nice choice of vegetarian or meat entrees.  The specials board is worth a look as well, especially the Chinese greens, which are absolutely wonderful.  Probably my favorite Chinese vegetable, and here they are expertly cooked to perfection.  Oyster sauce is light and flavorful, not that goopy nasty stuff you probably know from your local Chinese take-out.  You have your choice of noodles, as if you need that, as they are all wonderful.   The love doesn't stop with the food as they make lovely smoothies and drinks, with or without tapioca (sorry, reminds me of frog spawn).  The smoothies are made with soy milk, so even the vegan can get some joy at this place.   Tip the noodle makers too, they deserve it!!",

This is as authentic as Chinese noodles get.  If you don't like this place, you're just not a fan of homemade noodles.",

Thick noodle in soup with beef slices and regular noodle with spicy sauce. I did not care so much for my noodle with spicy sauce which seemd to have a really oily texture and overwhelmingly fishy taste. We also shared an order of pan fried dumpings: very large with tasty filling but required plenty of vinegar to cut the greasy coating. Overall, the food was overwhelmingly oily. I'd try again as perhaps we didn't hit the jackpot on our menu items. The boiled peanuts with daikon appetizer they bring you is pretty damn good, though!",

For soup I prefer the traditional hand pulled (its easier to eat). For fried noodled dishes I like wider noodles. For the more adventurous try the mixed appetizer plate. It has marinated beef, beef tendon (they have it as beef tender) and pigs ear. I was surprised that the taste was on the traditional side and not too westernized. I have to say I tried the pot stickers and didn't care for them. They were too chewy and did not like the taste or texture of the filling. But, to each his own. Overall I like this place and I will go back.",

The sauce is a fish sauce, the fish smell is pretty strong, but it doesn't taste strong, the citrus and garlic are more evident.  The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because the water taste really funny here.  Opt for a soda.",

I'm not really a noodle or soup person and would typically order fried rice over anything, but the #34 really hit the spot. Earlier today when I was sober, from bite 1, I was sold on the dish. The only criticism is it can be a tad spicier and next time I visit I'll ask them to kick it up a notch. My sister's soup was also great (she had the beef and noodle soup), I kept begging for sips of the broth alone. The pan fried dumplings were nice crispy and big. The dough of the dumpling was the thickest I've ever had but you won't hear complaints from me. I'll be back for sure, might be a new fave until I eat it so much I'm sick of it.",

I'd categorize food as Asian comfort food. There's nothing incredibly flashy about any of their dishes, but it always hits the spot. The prices are also incredibly low, even by Arizona standards. You're pretty much guaranteed to be really full while spending less than $10.   Despite the low prices, the service here is actually very good. Waiters are patient and will get your food out to you very fast. They don't have that slightly rude attitude that a lot of Chinese places will have. The employees are also really helpful and will make suggestions if you are overwhelmed by the incredible number of noodle options. There have also been many times when someone at our table orders some sort of combo and our waiter has suggested that he order it in a different manner that would produce the same results with cheaper pricing. The one problem is that, once in a while you get a waiter who speaks mostly Chinese. This isn't usually an issue for me, but if this is your first time coming here as a nonChinese speaker, I'd imagine it could be a little off putting.  I recommend this place if you're looking for someplace cheap, fast, and filling. I know I definitely will be back next time I swing by AZ.",

Best I've ever had. There was 1 person when we walked in at noon. They sat us at a booth that had holes ripped all in it. I guess for a hole in the wall kind of place it makes sense but still. It quickly got packed though within 20mins! They brought us cold noodles and peanuts to munch on till we got our meal. It was decent. My kids ( 7 & 5 yr old) shared the teriyaki chicken appetizer w/white rice. It was good but basically tasted like fried chicken without the breading. Again, good just not what I expected because there was little to no teriyaki flavoring. I had the shrimp & noodles. Shrimp was very rubbery which is a let down. Not much spice (which it did not say it would have any) so next time I will ask if we return. So 50% of the dish wasn't good. Saving grace was the noodles of course. My fiance did have the spicy beef & noodles. Wasn't spicy AT ALL!!!! So that was a huge let down. I excepted that to be spicy. We love super burn your mouth spicy and this was basically good seasoning....that's it. So overall my whole experience became a let down. I hate to do this to small business owners but I think it it's important to know True experiences so you can decide if you want to do anything about it.",

Perfect for pairing with their other entrees like the salt and pepper shrimp or fish.  Both I recommend, so crispy! I always go with the shaved noodles. Their regular ones are a bit thick and hard to eat and for a place that serves noodles, no one has scissors for you to use.   The establishment is small, but you can definitely fit a big party there and if you have kids, they can entertain themselves by watching the noodles being made!",

Lightly chewy and crispy at the same time, very thinly sliced, and nicely flavorful. Lunch and a show! Totally will be returning.",

    "text": "This review comes long overdue but hey, it's better late than never, right?  The entourage and I came in one rainy monsoon night to tuck into some delicious noodles.  I've been hearing about this place for a while --- about how their noodles are all hand-stretched and made with love.  I wanted to experience that for myself!  Walking to the restaurant was like walking into your typical cha chaan teng.  Service is speedy and not very personal and they do seem to treat people who speak Chinese a lot better from what I've observed.  Lucky me for being the table's representative, right?   After ordering an assorted marinated meat combination plate with pig ears and other succulent pieces of cold-served meats, we all got our noodle dishes.  Honestly, I wasn't too wowed by my dish.  I had ordered something that they assured me was similar to dandan noodles, what I was really craving for on this rainy night but it didn't really taste like it.  I think it was more like zha jiang mian.  Don't get me wrong, it was still delicious but it just took me by surprise.   Anyways, this is a pretty solid place and it definitely makes you feel like you're eating in Chinatown, San Francisco or something.  Place gets packed around dinner time so unless you want to rub some elbows with strangers, come for a late lunch or early dinner!",

This visit we got the server who doesn't seem to want to be there.  She's mostly indifferent but if you ask for stuff she will bring it.  The food is good.  Some of the best noodles anywhere.

We kept going back because of the sliced beef with noodle soup and tolerated the service. We didn't get the usual peanuts and salad at the beginning and I had to get up and get our own straws for our water. We weren't asked if we wanted something to drink, they just brought warm water without straws and immediately we were asked what we wanted. I keep asking myself if it's the culture difference that makes them act so indifferent towards the customers. Anyways we ate and left because we were being watched by the lady at the cashier to see when we were done from the beginning of our meal. We felt rushed to say the least even though there was still 45minutes till they closed. The worst part was halfway home when my girlfriend and I had to make an emergency stop at a bathroom because of the beef noodle soup we had. We have had it before but this was the only time our stomachs did not agree with the food. I don't think we will be returning. Decent noodles but gawd awful service. Hope this helps.    Oh and I kept noticing the noodles chef messing with his phone between stretching the noodles without washing his hands. (No gloves either)",

Our  meal was okay we order noodle B and it was too thick for our taste but if we order another type of noodle I bet we would've liked it a whole lot better. The spring rolls were amazing especially with sriracha sauce! We also order dumplings and they were huge we didn't finish them all it comes with 8 per platter and we only finished 2 dumplings. The food affordable and you get a big serving for the price.

The food was okay not as good as i expected it to be based off the reviews. Expecially since this place has been reviewed by food critics (Howard Seftel to name one) which i think might have been paid off by this restaurant. That critic must have not been a True food critic and is most likely looking for a free meal because this place is at best a 3 star and thats if the staff had any normal manners.",

I had ordered iced coffee with boba, as well as #34- Beef with Fried Noodles in XO Spicy Sauce.   The order seemed to have been brought to us fairly quickly, and the portion was fairly large; thus a good amount for the price of $7.95. I have a high level of spice tolerance, and so the level of spice was not very high for me, and I had ended up adding Sriracha sauce. However, it tasted good, and I would recommend trying this dish.  Also, the server was very friendly and professional.",

    "text": "I met a couple of my AOB buddies for lunch here. This joint is really close to my house and I frequent Lee Lee market plus meet buds for coffee at the Micky D's which is practically next door. We got there a little after 1 on a Friday. We were the only ones there. Now, when you talk about Chinese or Asian restaurants in general, one of the \"I'm freakin out\" moments is when you walk in and you're the only one(s) there. Immediately I confer with my comrades and we decide to hang out. \"What's the worse thing that could happen\", T says. \"You've had food poisoning before, it didn't kill ya\". Geeez. The 3 of us grabbed a booth and checked out the menu. Pretty straight forward. The cool thing is you see some of the standard Chinese fare but you get to choose the type of noodle that's in it.  There are 5 different sizes of noodles which are all hand pulled by the noodle maker right behind the glass window. So, if you have kids, bring them here. They can watch the guy making the noodles they're about to eat while you explain that REAL food doesn't come out of a box. But I digress. My one disappointment at this point is that there was no Rice Noodle. My favorite.  T ordered the Pan Fried Dumplings (8) $6.35. You can also get them steamed. Whoa. This is a meal in itself. The dough wrapper, lightly fried around the beef filling was yummy. We each had 2 and were already getting full.  I ordered the Spring Rolls (2) for $3.25. These were ok. Nothing special. I would have preferred a lot more vegetable stuffing. I would not recommend these. Because T, S & I were yapping away and not paying attention to anything but the noodle maker, we didn't realize that we pretty much ordered the same thing. I ordered the Beef With Stir-Fried Narrow Flat Noodles ($8.65). T ordered the Beef With Stir-Fried Shave Noodles In Xo Spicy Sauce ($8.65). So aside from the XO spicy sauce and the size of the noodle, we basically got the same dish. Oooops. With so many yummy things on the menu, this was a major goof on our part. S didn't order anything else which is a good thing because the portion size is plentiful.  Both dishes had plenty of sliced beef, the sauces were quite good and of course the noodles were amazing. S & I devoured the non spicy dish. Be prepared, the narrow flat noodles are VERY long. Which is a good thing because that represents long life and all, but it does make it hard to move from the serving plate to your plate. Plus, the noodles stuck together which made them more of a clump then individual strands. I also helped T with the XO spicy one. This dish was not as spicy as I thought it would be. T was sweating pretty good though and for someone who's family is from Myanmar plus he eats spicy food all the time, I chuckled just a little. This dish was made with shave noodles. These were much easier to move from the serving plate to my plate so yippee there and it was really tasty. Winner winner hand made noodle dinner. I would say that for an empty restaurant, the service was slow. Plus, the waiter brought out my entree first and after a very long pause the two apps, and then finally the other entree. Strange way for the kitchen to put out the dishes. I'll chalk it up to a cook that was maybe woken up from a nap when we walked in. Sorry. The other thing I didn't really like was that the noodles were piled on top of the veggies and sauce. This made it hard to really get the full flavor and texture with each bite until we ate enough of the noodles so we could actually get to some of the veggies. Strange way to present the food. Good food, good portion size, fair prices, cool to watch the noodles being made, friendly staff, slow, out of order service, sticky noodles, upside down presentation. 3 Stars",

Your first time here (and if you are not used to authentic Asian noodles) you may feel like the noodles are undercooked and a little chewy but once you get used to it you'll realize they are much better that way! If you order the thinner noodles then it is less noticeable. I can recommend anything off the \"stir-fry\" section of the menu. Even those used to American style PF Chang's will like those options. I love their dumplings as well but as other reviewers have mentioned they are humungous and you get six of them so only order that if you are with a group of hungry people!",

I have gotten beef tripe stew here and it was awesome; it felt like I was eating Asian menudo and that's a great feeling.  Service was good, but this place is just not special inside.

My kids liked the Deep Fried Tofu for $3.50 and it was a good portion size.  8 large chunks of tofu.    I tried the Braised Noodle with Sesame Paste (vegetarian) for $4.  It was so plain with very little taste.  Tasted slightly like peanut sauce.  I had to cover it in srarachi to get it down because I was so hungry.  Kids liked the Beef with Fried Noodles for  $7.95.  With the tofu it was enough food for my 3 kids that I brought home leftovers of both the noodles and tofu.  I tried the Vegetables with Fried Noodles on my first trip for $7.25.  They were just okay.  Even though the noodles are being made right there and you can watch through the window the taste was very similar to Panda Express to me.  Had three of the smoothies- Watermelon, Papaya and Strawberrry- all with boba.  The boba was pretty good but the smoothies weren't great.  I prefer Boba House around the corner in the same shopping center.  I don't think I will be back.",

The time we came in to eat we waited and sat down first. A group of Asian guys came in after us and were greeted and served small dishes before the meal they were more helpful with them than us. We got water and then they left us alone till they brought out our food. After we sat there eating everyone was just staring and I got very uncomfortable so I told my husband let's go. I probably will not dine in here again but the food was great so maybe To go is easier for non Asian people.",

I was initially suspicious when our orders came so quickly. After tasting it, I realised that the noodles were a little too hard (undercooked). I allowed the noodles to sit a little longer in the broth to soften up, but it's just not as good as digging into a perfectly prepared bowl of noodle soup.",

However, don't let the lack of decor fool you. The food more than makes up for it. This is the only Chinese restaurant in the greater Phoenix area that makes real hand pulled noodles. The last time I had noodles of this quality, it was in Hong Kong!   There is a big picture window where you can watch the chef stretching the dough and making any of the 5 kinds of noodles. I started off with the marinated beef tendon. Usually, you get a small plate with a little portion of the tendon on it. Here, I was surprised to get a big plate with a huge portion of tendon on it. To be honest, it was more than I could possibly eat, but we all made a good stab at it.  Next, I ordered a portion of noodles with XO sauce. This is a spicy sauce that really brings out the flavors in foods, and I was not disappointed. It was fun to watch the chef prepare the dish through the window. All my guests were mesmerized watching the preparation. Each person ordered a different dish, and all were pronounced flavorful and excellent.  Service is simple, but quick. Considering the prices, one has to wonder how they can stay in business. Big plates of food at very low prices.  Were it not for the simple decor, this place would easily rate 4 stars.  3 stars for portion size and quality.  A good place to eat your fill at a reasonable price.",

The two dishes I normally order are the noodle with minced pork and beef noodle with spicy XO sauce. Both are delicious have different taste. This is definitely my go to spot when I'm craving Chinese noodles. Reasonably priced as well.",

Be aware, this place is not Panda Express so don't come here and complain they don't have orange chicken.  That's not what this place is about.  It's about the noodles!  They do have a smaller menu with the variety really about the kind of noodle you can order (different widths and thickness of the hand made noodles).  Thus the aptly name of the shop.    My favorite things to get are their garlic green beans, mix of thinly slice beef parts (tendon, ear, and shank) and and their XO beef noodles.  The pan fried dumplings come out nice and hot and every time I have had them, it is crunchy on the bottom as it should be!  I have tried many of their noodle dishes and other than the XO noodles, the minced pork with sliced cucumbers noodles and beef noodles are my second and their favorite.  They do give a hearty portion of noodles.  I don't know why but I feel that the thinner noodles are better because the sauce and other flavor coat them better but that's just a personal preference.  Ultimately, what drives me back here even though it is in Chandler (and I live in Tempe, right next to ASU so it is a 20 min drive) is the reasonable prices and fast service.  They really do a great job and I have never in my years of eating here had to wait very long before the food comes. Yes, it is True the inside decor, chairs, and table are kind of worn and well-loved but who cares?  The chopsticks are clean and the food is awesome - that's all the Asians care about when it comes to food!  Just like in Taiwan - we'll happily sit on a bucket and  slurp down the cheap and great tasting noodles with the greatest of joy!",

Decided to give it another chance and glad we did. Maybe the first time we did not order the right items.   A must item are the pot stickers, you get 8 to an order and they are huge monster size and could easily be a meal by itself.  Must item 1A - The fried fish fillet is also very good and has a nice minor kick to it but is not spicy but good and flavorful.  There are quite a bit of choices for noodles which are freshly made on the spot and good entertainment. You can get thin, thick, regular, flat thin, flat thick. I like the normal or thin, the thick is too much for me.  We had the #22 and the #19 Noodle dishes, the #19 was the Seafood with an Alfredo style sauce which was a bit thick and just okay sauce.   Would recommend the #22 Noodles with Minched Pork which has good Sauce.  We also ordered the green beans which came out as a huge serving and were pretty good.   Keep in mind this is a no frills place so come for the food not the decor and the service is pretty good.   Glad we gave it a 2nd try and will be back again",

Initially I thought well...that's just bs because the top 100 chinese restaurants in American should all be locate in San Francisco/Bay Area, Los Angeles/San Gabriel Valley and New York City. I figured I'm in the general Phoenix area and will need my Chinese food fix so why not give it a shot?   Food:  Hand pulled noodles! In Phoenix! I ordered the Ox-tail hand pulled noodles (wide noodles) in soup. Absolutely delicious. Very al dente texture. Soup and oxtail had good calm flavors.   Beef tendon - Sliced and soaked in a sweet vinegar sauce. Slices were a bit too big, but it was very well made.   Service: Very plain robotic service. Not bad. Nothing stood out of the ordinary.   Environment:  This placed is tucked to the right of Lee Lee market. Clientele is 50% Chinese which is impressive considering this is Arizona and Asians seem fairly rare.   Price:  Fairly well priced. Two dishes ended up being less than $14.   Food: 5 Service: 3 Environment: 4 Price: 5",

Been here a few times, always liked it, this last time was the best and finally bumps it up to 5 stars.  We ordered marinated tendon, hot and spicy pig ears, an oxtail noodle soup, and a beef rib noodle soup.  The marinated tendon and spicy pig ears were both good.  Chewy, well-seasoned, no complaints.  The review mainly goes to what should be the star here - the noodles.  Sometimes the broth here can be a little salty.  Not today.  Clean, beefy taste, balanced, with herbal notes from cilantro.  The noodles were plentiful and perfectly cooked.  They were long, good chew, good thickness.  The meat in each of our bowls is kind of an afterthought.  You can order whatever meat you want and the broth and noodles are going to taste the same.  The meat is a welcome but unnecessary addition to this excellent bowl of noodle soup.    I also heartily recommend the noodles with XO sauce.  These are a fried noodle and the sauce is great.  Really delicious.  A little oily, but delicious.  Hand-pulled noodles are just superior in most ways to factory noodles, and the noodles here measure up to great pulled noodles in NYC and LA.",

    "text": "First things first, potstickers.  I don't care that this place is called a noodle house, and a magic one at that, get yourself some of those potstickers.  And fried too, none of this boiled business.  Heck, just order that and have that as your meal, they're definitely big enough.  Okay now on to what the name says they're good for, noodles.  The hubby ordered the stir fry beef with spicy XO sauce (#34) with thick noodles and well, to put it simply, he was extremely satisfied with his order.  However, I had a try and though I'm no noodle connoisseur, the noodles were a little tougher than I was expecting, reminding me of undercooked spaghetti.  I'm not sure if this was the correct texture of this noodle, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I did however, really enjoy the spicy XO sauce which definitely gave it a little kick, but nothing too overwhelming which was much appreciated.  My beef stew (#25) with flat noodles, was more of a soup (who would've thought, you know, being a stew and all), and flat noodles were a mistake.  The noodles aren't cut up to fit on your spoon so you're left to fend for yourself against these absurdly long, flat noodles with a pair of chopsticks, and in my case, some feeble chopstick-wielding hands.  I made a mess, with noodles falling back into my bowl of soup ever so often, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  The soup which is broth-ier than pho was delicious - I finished every last drop, and the meat which was so flavorful and soft, was gone seconds after I got my bowl.  Now that's saying something, cause I'm a carbs girl and would go all out for them noodles but, but!  I am really sad to say that in either noodle dish, I felt that there wasn't enough meat.  I probably got 4 slices of beef in mine, and there was probably 5 slices in the hubby's dish.  Otherwise, the portion sizes are substantial, as long as you like noodles.  I mean seriously, if you don't, you shouldn't be here.  Oh well they do sell fried rice, so there's that.",

This is the only of the restaurant in Arizona that matched the quality.  We ordered Steve Jobs links, two flat noodle beef stews, medium sized noodle chicken stirfry, and sauteed  Chinese broccoli. The dumpling casing was so good and fresh that you could've eaten it even without the stuffing.  The soup bowls were packed with noodles and other ingredients. The flavor was flawless.

    "text": "Fresh, just from last night review :) our very first time here. We arrived just before 6 PM and just missed the dinner rush. My little family was seated immediately and served with waters and a small plate of pickled daikon + carrots and peanuts. I LOVE pickled daikon + carrots so that was definitely a treat for me. We ordered spring rolls, the seafood stir fry noodles, and veggie stir fry noodles with SPICY sauce (a modification I made). We have the choice of narrow, thick, regular, wide, or shave noodles. We went with regular for both since it was our first time. While waiting for our food, we took our one year old to watch the HAND-PULLED NOODLES being made fresh before our eyes. Besides, Din Thai Fung, which we don't have here, this is the first time we have had fresh handmade noodles like this. Our family are all noodle lovers so this was very very exciting for us. In about 15 minutes or less, we received our veggie spring rolls first (one order = 2 spring rolls with sweet and sour sauce). They were perfectly crispy. Slightly bland, but still good enough. Our one year old loved it. Just moments later our noodles came out. We were definitely floored with how much noodle came in one order! I thought to myself, \"we are definitely going to have leftovers!\" The flavors for both noodle dishes were just right. The seafood was cooked to perfection. Adding spicy sauce to veggie noodles was the kick I needed. Not too spicy that I couldn't enjoy them. They were very generous with the vegetables. Needless to say, I was wrong about having leftovers -- we ended up finishing all of our food. It was just that good. I'm not sure what took us so long to come here because we really do love noodles but we will definitely be coming here on the regular from now on! The reason for 4 stars is that the water did not taste good. I would stay clear and order a drink next time.",

The wife and I share a #34 - Beef w/ Stir-fried Noodles in Spicy XO sauce, and a #24 - Sliced Beef with Noodles Soup. We also share an order dumplings (which can be ordered steamed or panfried) with the kiddos, who typically enjoy chicken with stir-fry noodles and dumplings.   They also have a HUGE selection of boba options, which is always nice after a great meal!",

Went during the lunch rush so it was pretty busy in there & only 2 waiters working! Service was quick though.  I ordered the pan fried dumplings & the spicy xo beef with wide noodles. The dumplings were huge! The outside dough of the dumplings you can tell were made using the same dough for the noodles. They were generously stuffed with meat & pan fried to perfection. The noodle dish was also such a huge portion. Not as spicy as I expected it to be. My coworker loves spicy food but he was afraid it would might be too spicy but when he tried a bite of mine, he said it was just the right amount of heat. I on the other hand would have liked It a little spicier.  Overall flavors of the noodles were amazing. Just wish it had some more veggies in the dish. The noodles had a nice chewy texture to them. & You can even watch the guy through the glass hand tossing noodles!",

He seemed to enjoy his dish, but when I tried it, the noodles seemed a bit hard like they were not cooked long enough.  That's why I enjoyed my soup better, because at first the noodles were a bit hard, but as they sat in the broth longer they softened up.  If I come back, I would get another soup.  We also tried the steamed dumplings.  The dumpling skin is VERY thick, not necessarily in a bad way.  Overall, the dumplings are tasty and filling, but not my favorite I've ever had.",

They make the noodles onsite through a window where you or the young ones can watch and there are choices.  What I enjoy is that there is around 40 choices limited to a few types of dishes and your. It overwhelmed with 1000 items that are impossible to quality check.    Today we ordered the steamed dumplings (a favorite), slices beef stew (see pic) with amazingly tender and quality beef and noodle and egg roles which are delish.  I rated a four because there is always an awkward aroma when you arrive which makes the event somewhat difficult at first.  The other reason is that I find the noodles to be a little bland but that may just be preference not quality.  Note: No adult beverages served and very family friendly.",

If you aren't used to firmer and fresh made noodles don't come here. If you prefer over cooked store bought noodles you will be disappointed.   Culturally if you disapprove of the food you don't outright complain as it is seen as extremely shameful and rude! If you disapprove then don't eat the food and leave. A full plate left is also insulting but a more acceptable way to show your dissatisfaction. If you don't care about cultural customs then just be a typical un cultured person and whine.   Besides all the formalities this is truly a gem of a restaurant as most(99.9%) don't bother making their own noodles.

The service was friendly and I will return :)",

I ordered pan fried pot stickers, which were easily the best I've ever had.  Then the fresh mango juice, best I've had since I lived in Brazil & cut the mangoes off the tree.  The spicy pan fried noodles with beef (#34) were flat out incredible.    With prices that are pretty close to what they charge at Panda Express, the food is easily ten times better.  The noodles are scratch made, fresh for every order, and you can watch them slapping & pulling the noodles through the window if you have the right seat.  Go here, even if you order ahead & take it to go.  You won't regret it!",

    "text": "I've been here 3-4 times now, visited again today and the other times were a few years back.    I went at about 12:30pm, and it was well attended for being the middle of lunch.  The service was good, took a little bit of time (~10min) for the food. Tried the XO spicy beef noodle dish (#34) with shaved noodles, as I recall liking the chewiness of those thicker noodles.  I feel like the noodles here are good - delicious, but the sauces are lackluster.  I tend to like my dishes fairly flavorful.  The dish I tried today was moderately spicy, but aside from the spicy taste, that there wasn't much flavor to it.  A good array of veggies, bean sprouts, lettuce, carrots. The beef was good, but not remarkable.  The price was ~$9, more expensive than I remembered (and for lunch), but the portion was large and fitting of the price.  My key determinant for food is the flavor/sauce of a dish, though, and since I haven't recalled being wowed by the dishes I've tried so far, I probably will not be back for awhile.  Side note:  When I visited years earlier, I had a dish that was very flavorful, but primarily because it was mainly a slightly diluted oyster sauce.  If you are familiar with that sauce, it is tasty but very strong by itself.  While that dish definitely had a lot of flavor, it's too much flavor such that it is hard to eat large portions of it.  Not sure if that dish has since changed.",

One of the fun aspects of this place is the window in to the kitchen where they pull noodles. I had my back to it and managed to get a good amount of sauce on my short trying to catch a glimpse of the noodle artists in action.   The menu is a pretty good size, however there are only 3-4 vegetarian options.  The waiter was nice enough to make a few recommendations and modifications.   Prices are low about $7 per dish. The dishes are a bit on the Smaller side for us big Americans so if you have a few people get 1 extra and share.  We had the veggie noodles and noodles with sesame paste. The veggie ones were quite familiar with the wake taste beansprouts and other veggies  The one with the sesame paste was great, but could have used a veggie to offset the texture.  bottom line fun place good food but limited veg options.",

I got the seafood soup one, which was a bit bland without me adding a bunch of sauces and pepper to it, but the beef noodles with oyster sauce that my brother got was quite tasty. I totally stole a few pieces of beef from him. The noodles in both were chewy and fresh. If you don't request a specific type of noodle, I think they default to the ramen ones--a little thicker than \"normal\" ramen but much yummier. We also both got boba milk tea, which was decent (you could tell it was made from real tea) and reasonably priced at $2.50.  I will be back.",

Overall first impressions of the restaurant were mediocre at best, as the decor isn't anything special.  We were greeted promptly after walking through the door and were seated right away.  Based on previous reviews, we ordered the pot stickers as an appetizer.  The reviews definitely didn't disappoint, as these were BY FAR the best I've ever eaten!  They were fried perfectly, large in size and the dipping sauce they came with was delicious.  My husband ordered the beef w/stir-fried noodles and I had the chicken w/stir-fried noodles w/the spicy sauce.  We both ordered different noodles with our dishes and both were delicious (wide and flat & thin noodles).  Overall, we were VERY happy with the quality of the food and the portion size - very generous and we took home lots of leftovers.  When we visit again, I'm going to order just the pot stickers, as they are a meal in itself.  As for the service, the restaurant wasn't busy, yet we didn't have anyone checking on us and we had to wait for our check to be delivered (servers were sitting in chairs on their cell phone).  Luckily, the food made-up for the  poor service and will not prevent us from coming back again.",

My family loves getting the green beans as a side dish. While I know Hong Kong rolls are listed as an appetizer they are a great dessert. I do find the soup broths a little bland.   I admit I have not liked everything I've ever had here but I was exploring dishes. I am an adventurous eater though so I don't blame the kitchen in those cases.  You need to be aware that you're only coming for the food. It's a small hole in the wall location. There is no fancy decor. Most of the wait staff does not speak English. I find a lot of times the behavior some people find rude stem from a difference in culture. You're not going to get a waiter who is super perky and grovels for you if you're the slightest bit displeased. You will instead get basic service that gets your delicious food to you as quickly as possible.   The noodles are amazing. So amazing. No matter what dish you get. Nothing can beat a fresh noodle. I know some people not used to fresh noodles can sometimes find them a bit oddly textured. It's ok. Don't try to compare them to your dried noodles at home. These are different and wonderful.  Everything is super cheap. The food is hot, quick, and delicious. The noodles are amazing and fun to watch being made. What more do you want?",

These are Chinese 'pot-stickers'.  These are the remotely the same dough or preparation.    These pot-stickers are very, very good.  Pan fried - for once they are not too crispy or dried out, like most valley restaurant prepare them.  The dipping sauce that accompanies them is good, but add a bit of red chile oil to your plate, a splash of black vinegar.  Now you've got the real Chinatown pot sticker good stuff.    5 different kinds of noodles -ask the waiter which one goes best with your choices.  The beef with shaved noodles was terrific - beef just melted in your mouth.  How do they do that with beef?  We also ordered the curry with thin pulled noodles.  The shrimp were large, sweet and perfectly cooked.  The curry sauce was not all that great, and I wouldn't order it again - but I'd order another dish with those shrimp without hesitation.  Chicken fried rice, no usually one of my favorites, was a shining star in this place.  Again, the meat was tender, moist - and all white meat chicken.    Beef soup with noodles.  Again, that superb tender beef.  Broth was deep flavored, with a distinct tinge of anise.  Just wonderful.    Service is friendly, helpful and anxious to please.  Excellent service from Charles, and nice guy to chat with.  If you like authentic Chinese noodles, don't miss out on this place",

    "text": "I like this place.  Hand pulled noodles are awesome and I love how fobby it is!    This place gets awesome-points for hand pulled noodles, looking like Taiwan, inexpensive pricing, big portions, and the large window that allows you to look into their kitchen and watch the guy make noodles.  I must say I'm hard on Asian restaurants because I've eaten lots of Taiwanese/Chinese cuisine in the bay area and LA.    The food here is authentic.  The taste is pretty good if you order the right things.  The beef noodle soup could be better; if you do have a hankering for \"hong shao niu rou mian\", this will allieve it but you'll probably think there's something missing from it.  Favorites:  Noodles in spicy sauce (vegetarian) Beef noodles with oyster sauce",

    "text": "Handmade noodles, pretty much as good as it gets  Remember that just like Pho, you need to add vinegar, white pepper, chile paste, sirachi, soy, to the flavor profile you desire - it may take a few attempts to create the perfect flavor profile  However once you unlock your hidden combination it is fantastic  The best soup is the beef stew, it is superior to the ox tail, the oxtail is good but the beef stew is a better overall dish, and I highly recommend getting the salt and pepper shrimp, they serve you a huge plate of shrimp  The boiled peanuts and daikon are for texture and palate cleansing to break up the soft noodle and salty broth, great combination",

As I was 5 mins away, I quickly got into my car and dashed over there!!!! When I got there, there were 2 other people in the restaurant and the waiter, understandably was telling them they could only order take out as it was so close to closing time.  Of course, I was crest fallen. I mean, I was STARVING!!!  It was a busy day- the last time I had something in my stomach was before noon- and now, I have to have take out and eat the noodles in a darkened parking lot inside my car?!?! What's a girl to do in a situation like this?  I pulled out my best sad puppy eyes and my best Chinese!!!!  And I asked them if I could PLEASE eat the noodle soup inside the restaurant. I think it was the Chinese that did the trick as they were surprised this banana spoke Chinese!!!! Ha!  You can bet this bowl of noodle soup was the best tasting one I had ever had!!!!! Oh so tasty and satisfying for my growling empty stomach!!!!! Yes, be impressed as I ate furiously away at my noodle soup while 3 people watched me, waiting to close. And I finished my bowl of lamb noodle soup, noodle style D in slurping 15 mins so I was belly full satisfied by 9:30pm closing time.  That's right, fastest noodle eating ever!!!! Thanks wait staff at China Magic Noodle House for having a little compassion for this (was) starving little 'ole me to let me eat in the restaurant when really, what you wanted after a long day of working was to close up shop and go home!!!!",

The beef noodle soup is very filling.  The sauteed noodles, fried rice and appetizers-the garlic shrimp and fried fish are generous portions, so we always share.  Food is very affordable and delicious.",
