I am so pleased that I did.  We sat in a bck booth (luckily away from the live musician).  We ordered baked ziti and spinach lasagna.   The hubby go a sald yo go with his ziti and I got Reisling with my spinach lasagna.  The dishes came piping hoy and cheesy.   The hubby's ziti was the perfect texture, sauce amoubt and crispy cheese was amazing.  My loaded spinach lasagna was firm, full of spichach and covered in cheese.  I have to say the salad and wine were noyhing spectacular but functional.   The garlic toast was soft and buttery as well.  The service was adequate; perhaps a little slow even though it wasn't super busy.  The biggest complaint the live musician who was a good background music piano player but when he sang it was embarrassing.   He wad not good.  Would have been had he not sung at all.  Otherwise it was a terrific Friday night dinner out.",

I've ordered delivery twice so far, and both times they've been earlier than they estimate (first time they were a minute early lol, the second like 20 minutes).  They even call to let you know they're on their way, and the drivers are super friendly.  The pizzas are tasty, especially for their price point.  The first time I ordered a cheese/half pepperoni pizza, and it was ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Oddly enough there was one super tiny slice that had no cheese on it lol.  I couldn't explain it.  Second time it was the margarita, which was good.  The wings are big and meaty, and have always had tons of sauce.  Great experience.",

I didn't know they had it and was stuck getting lousy Z Pizza when I was eating with my vegan or lactose-intolerant friends.  Not only does it get the job done, it gets the job done well enough that no one, not even me, misses the real cheese.  Second:  Not only is Pizza Heaven is open on Sundays, it's open until 10 PM on Sundays.  All those pizza restaurants that think that no one really NEEDS pizza on a Sunday can suck it.  Sometimes no other food will do.  And luckily for Phoenicians, they have an excellent family-owned option when that Sunday craving hits.",

You could chuck a rock from the front door and break the glass of one or two other pizza places, but you wouldn't be able to find anything else within walking distance worth eating....   The kid behind the counter was really nice and the slice I had was delicious... spicy pepperonis and tasty crust. My only gripe would be that it tasted a bit re-heated, but those of you familiar with pizza by the slice joints will probably enjoy that. I can't expect them to cook an entire fresh pizza for me just to eat one slice... especially in the mid-afternoon.   The place was clean and the bathroom was pretty nice. I'll be back.",

    "text": "My last review was hard to swallow, it wasn't something that I particularly liked doing. Having said that, I am proud to say I can't possibly give Pizza Heaven anything less then 5 stars now. This is why:  Two days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).  I am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.  I am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix.",

I have always loved their vegan calzone and their vegan baked ziti, but recently they actually added a whole separate vegan menu with extra vegan options and the last time I was there the wait staff told me (or rather, they told my omnivore mother, who is much less shy and much more talkative than I am) that the owner was so pleased with how well the vegan menu was doing that they were planning on adding even more options in the near future.  So far I have had (that I can remember) the vegan calzone, the vegan baked ziti, the veggieballs, the hot veggie sandwich with vegan cheese and the angel bites. If you ask, they will also make you vegan garlic bread, although I don't believe that's actually on the menu yet. All of it is great, although the angel bites could have been a little bit sweeter or more interesting considering that's their only vegan dessert option so far.  Also, the vegan calzones make for great leftovers, especially if you ask for a little to-go container for the sauce as well so you can dip it. I have done this multiple times.",

That would be about the only thing i could find wrong. They used to be a small little dive restaurant and have now moved several years ago to the location they are now. Food has always been good though. Sometimes dives are the best! It is family owned and run so  i think that is why they take such pride in the place. A very good thing. They have their own parking lot but, not many spaces on a busy  night. Great place for a meal at any time.",

    "text": "Pizza Heaven = Service Hell I had not heard of this place and decided to take a chance on it because they had a Groupon. We ordered our dinner and asked for the starter dinner salad add on as a Caesar. 30 minutes after we ordered (with less than 50% of the restaurant filled), I asked where the starter salad was and was told that it would be out soon. It was delivered 10 minutes later and was a huge dinner salad. It looked great and I commented that this was a huge salad for a starter. The server told me that it was not the starter salad, it was the entree salad. I asked why I received this when I asked for the add on to the entree. She said that the Caesar was not the same add on and I would have to pay for the entree salad. I asked why she would assume that we wanted the entree when I asked for the $1.75 starter with Caesar dressing and she said that a Caesar wasn't an option and they only had the entree salad. She took it back without an apology and brought back a really small bowl salad with a small portion of Caesar on the side. Dinner came out burned and hard to cut with a knife, but after 45 minutes we weren't about to send it back. The food was ok, but nothing to note. Then we got the check and the dinner salad was $2.75. When we inquired why it was $1.00 more than the menu price, our server said that Caesar Dressing is a $1.00 up-charge (more than 50% upgrade) for the salad. Our table was blown away by the fact that there was an up-charge for a standard dressing, especially after the long wait and attempt to charge full price for the error that our server made. We paid the full price for everything and let her know that the service was horrible. She seemed to really not care and let us leave without offering to speak to a manager or an apology. BE WARNED: This place has ok food, but horrible service that really doesn't care if you like it or come back.",

The Italian dressing, supposedly vegan, was just bad. According to Jason, the steak sandwich was like what you get in a package at Costco. Not bad taste, just generic.

    "text": "I came here on a Saturday night, with a Groupon. It's a small establishment with a compact parking lot, and both were jam-packed. Luckily, someone was leaving as I was pulling into the lot, so I was able to grab a spot. (I don't know if they have an overflow lot, but they should.)   Once inside, I quickly observed the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign.  We were asked how many were in our party, after which the hostess/waitress (they seem to be one in the same) scurried off to assess the availability.  As said earlier, it was packed, and there were others also waiting.  I was thinking we'd have to wait forever and that my starving spirit animal would come bursting out of my abdomen, like in those beef jerky commercials. But we ended up waiting no more than about 5 minutes before we were shown to a booth. (I love booths!)  DESIGNATED VEGAN MENU: There's a vegan menu inserted inside of their regular menu.  The waitress said that patrons keep taking them out, so if you want the vegan menu and don't see it, just ask for one.  The vegan options include appetizers, hot stuffed sandwiches, pasta, calzone, pizzas, and desserts.  It wasn't listed on the menu, but they also have a vegan cheesecake, which you can get topped with chocolate syrup or mixed berry sauce.   My order: Veggieballs in buffalo hot sauce -  They are described as vegan meatballs, so I'm thinking faux-beef \"meat\" balls. I was pleasantly surprised when I cut into one and found actual vegetables: peas, string beans, carrots, & corn. They were positively delicious. A slightly crispy coating covered in a proper buffalo sauce, which had a legit heat level. Excellent dish for only $5.95. Comes w/ vegan ranch and carrot sticks.   Vegan Spaghetti with soy sausage, $8.50 - (Beautiful presentation.) The pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. The sauce and the soy sausage were bland, however.  Aside from flavor, I don't know what to say that it was lacking. A dash of this? A splash of that? Not sure, but it was a pretty big boring bowl of blah. I kept furiously twirling my fork in the saucy mix, thinking that maybe the flavor was at the bottom somewhere, clicking its heels thrice and trying to get back home, but no luck. If you avoid salt/seasoning (and flavor), as well as meat, then this is your dish. I liked the vegan garlic bread though.   Dessert- Vegan cheesecake w/ mixed berry sauce, $6.50 - I never ate cheese before going vegan, but I used to eat cheesecake (weird, I know), so I do have something with which to compare vegan versions. I have had some better-than-real-cheesecake vegan cheesecakes, but this isn't one of them. I did not like it. The cheesecake had a weird, grainy, earthy taste to it. And it was like, almost smooth & creamy, (*singing* Ooooh, we're 1/2 way theeeere...) but it didn't quite make it there.  Silver lining? The crust and mixed berry sauce were both good.  Angel bites, $4.95 - (If you've ever been to France or New Orleans, think beignets, except here, they are vegan.) They cover theirs with cinnamon and powdered sugar, and they offer you one of 3 dipping sauces: agave, chocolate, or caramel. (The caramel is NOT vegan, fyi.) I chose the chocolate. O-M-G. These suitably named bites of awesomeness brought me life. They came out hot, fresh & ready to be devoured. This is one of those treats that you want to eat right away because you know they won't taste the same later. But they give you so many! (Which is a great thing!) You can easily share this dessert with 2 or more people.  Non vegan: My non-veggie DD got the Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer, and the Cajun Chicken Alfredo pasta w/ shrimp added. She liked the pasta, but said it was definitely spicy.    Nice ambience, especially for dates. I don't know if they take reservations, but I suggest asking, especially for busy weekend nights.  As busy as they were, the staff was still nice and attentive. The owner was making rounds and asking patrons how their meals were. Cool little bistro. Great for vegans dining with omnivores.  I'll go back for more buffalo Veggieballs and Angel Bites.",

The guy moved them and sat us without cleaning the table. Then he disappeared for a while. During this time I asked another sever to clean our table. She sprayed the table and got the cleaner all over my pants and continued to spray near our drinks. Then we waited and waited. We had two little kids with us who were getting hungry and after 20 minutes of waiting for him to come back to even take our order, we decided to leave. Horrible first impression. Horrible service. Horrible hygiene. We won't be back.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to find a good italian place around town and decided it was time to drop into Pizza Heaven. We started with 10 bone-in wings in the agave bbq sauce. The wings were sauced nicely and my husband ordered the milder version, I think the hot agave would have had just the right flavor. The wings were the perfect crisp and very tasty overall. I ordered the spinach and chicken alfredo which was served with two huge pieces of foccacia. OMG! I am super picky, especially when it comes to cream sauces but this was one of the best alfredo sauces I have ever had. It had a ton of white meat chicken and fresh spinach. It was surprisingly light for being a cream based sauce and I couldn't get enough. My husband built his own pizza with hand tossed crust, the marinara sauce, pepperoni and sausage throughout and jalapenos on half. The crust was perfect and the toppings very flavorful. Our service experience was a bit strange but we had some recommendations and the food will bring us back for more. They offered a few drink specials and looked to offer pizza by the slice and other lunch specials during the day. I just found my new go-to italian place in Central Phoenix. Yum!",

Baked ziti and soy sausage was incredible, and their calzone was one of the best ive ever had in general. Patricia visited our table and offered us to try their angel bites as a desert, which was scrumptious. Since my experience was based strictly off of their vegan menu, they definitely earned the stars. This was my first time visiting and would definitely stop by again when i get the chance.",

Very unique dishes and it's not plane Jane food!  Flavors will pop in your mouth and you will quickly become addicted!  Homemade breads and crusts that you won't believe!  I want to eat everything at once!  From the pizzas, to the calzones, the meatballs, the pastas, everything is amazing here!  If you haven't been, I strongly encourage you to drop by and then you will for sure be a regular!  Oh, I left out the yummy desserts too!! Amongst the non-vegan desserts, they also have homemade vegan cheesecake and doughnuts!  Absolutely the best restaurant I've found in town, seriously!

I'm a server myself, so I know when the restaurant is slow, I tend to forget more. No biggie :) mozzarella sticks are yummy, hot, and waaay more filling than you think! I took half of those home (order of 6). I asked what pasta the waiter recommended out of the two I was on the fence about and ended up with the tequila lime chicken... AMAZING. Spicy, succulent sauce that made the whole dish. Jalapenos that are sauteed and add a nice level of heat and texture as well. The sauce was super delicious dipped in the focaccia bread!!  I've ordered to go as well. Got the same pasta and the hot wings (extra crispy). They delivered so quickly! The hot wings are hot, but have actual FLAVOR and depth unlike a lot of \"hot wings\" out there, so they appear less hot than you would think. (Highly recommend). The pasta was just as good as the first time, but the noodles got a little softer in the delivery process.  I seriously love this place. Good lunch specials, awesome, authentic food, and fast delivery. I still need to try their pizza and a bunch else, cause everything looks so good! Thank you, Pizza Heaven Bistro :)",

Their substitute for Meatballs is creative yet I find the Veggieballs to be better non fried and the buffalo sauce could use a lot less salt. The Pizza starts at $12 and looks delicious yet lack flavor.  The Tequila Lime Chicken was not very good, rather disappointing. A lot of pasta and the chicken was over cooked and hard.  Perhaps this was a dish they whipped up close to closing time yet, come on... really?",

I suggest asking for extra sauce on this pizza (their sauce is good).  I think my new favorite pizza is the BBQ chicken pizza.  It has a good taste and has nice big hunks of chicken on it.  I have not tried their other menu items yet.  Pizza Heaven is the only pizza place I keep coming back to.  They were also able to take care of my order of 4 pizzas in a timely manner.",

They were excellent in the marinara sauce That's all I had here. It was okay. Just had to give it a try and see if it was good. I don't  know if I would come here again.

Anyway, talking standard pizza here, the ingredients are quality, service is good (20 minute turn around whenever I take out), price is reasonable, and it tastes delicious.

Owner passes by your table to check on things and live music on weekends is terrific. The musicians even paused from their set to sing happy birthday and present us with free dessert. Cute! Sure made his day :-) Dough is made fresh here, sausage is made fresh here ...and if you have a special request or a diet restriction? No problem, just mention it and you are in good Italian hands.",

There were pieces of plastic in my food.  I almost choked on on them. ended throwing most of it out. I called to complain and was given, *Sorry*. I figured that staff probably can not make a *corporate decision*.  Also figured the lazagna was frozen  prior, the reasoning being, the plastic container, when food was frozen, broke off into the food.  2nd problem. Ordered a WORKS PIZZA. It was delivered with less items than usual. Called and another pizza was delivered but the rest of our meal had to be re-heated.               3rd problem.      ordered a Greek salad. it was delivered w/the box half empty. called and another salad was delivered.  My family started    their dinner before I received my salad.    seems care is not taken with delivery orders.",

    "text": "Went here with 11 of my friends on an early Saturday night. They had plenty of room to accommodate us all... they only messed up 1 order, considering our group size that wasn't too bad.  I got the hand tossed pizza... I think I would have preferred the thin crust. I was told they had NY style pizza but to me the standard hand tossed crust was too thick to be called NY style. NY style needs to fold easily and you need to give it a minute in its folded state to drip out the excess grease. The folding action was challenging and not nearly as greasy as I expected... I have to say that I still very much enjoyed my pizza. The sauce had a nice spice and the cheese was gooey. I think I'll have to try it again with the thin crust and perhaps my 4-star will go to 5-star. Others ordered entrees from the menu and everyone was quiet when eating (always a good sign of good food when you're too busy eating to talk).",

Go to this place and indulge on anything on the vegan menu, which is vast. My cup of wine runneth over for the clandestine food that tricks my belly into believing it is enjoying a fatty treat, which it is not. You can access the vegan menu by going to their Facebook page rather than their website. SERVICE- The owner is kind and helpful and gets really jazzed up about the vegan menu too.

Are you serious? \"Better be some damn good wings\", I thought to myself..  Homie on the phone said my delivery would take 30-45 minutes. Ya.. No. Add an hour to that.   Pizza and wings finally arrived, and I was fucking starving.. Honestly.. the pizza was bad. I want chewy crust, flavorful sauce, and stretchy cheese. Pizza Heaven offers none of these mandatory pizza components..  The wings were soggy on the outside, and over cooked on the inside. The meat was tough, and stringy.  What a waste of time, and money. Don't be fooled by some of the reviews on here.. What I experienced was nothing short of Pizza Hell-",

I'm a fan because if I am (gasp!) not in the mood for pizza, I can get a small salad and breadsticks.   Everything has been fresh, quality and presentation solid - and I am consistently a happy camper!  Definitely a nice place to have in my work and home area - and so much better than any of the chains!",

Then waited over an hour - the appetizers did not even come.  Someone came by and said they would check on it for us and nothing.  I went up after an hour with no food and said we wanted it to go and the check.  It took another 10 min to get the food to go and they charged us the full amount. The servers kept saying the restaurant was so busy but at 9pm we were one of only a few tables.  The tables around us got served before us.  I asked for a manager and they said they were getting one.  Then they said only the kitchen manager was present and there was nothing he could do.  They refunded $10 to the bill and now we are driving home with soggy cold food at 9:30pm.  Absurd.  I will be calling the restaurant tomorrow and hopefully getting in touch with a manager.    Why does this thing make you put one star?  This is a zero star review!!!!  ................ UPDATED:  I just spoke with the owner Patricia who is going to make this right for me and my family.  She is a sweetheart!    We have to give business the opportunity to right a wrong and she went above and beyond to turn the experience around.    I will return and thank you to the owner for caring enough to reach out to me!",

    "text": "I LOVE this restaurant! They are one of only a handful of restaurants in the Phoenix area who serve good vegan pizza- and a variety of them, too. They have some other vegan dishes which I haven't tried, but the fact that they offer vegan ranch to accompany fries or pizzas is AWESOME!  An issue came up recently, however, and I hope someone with the restaurant reads these reviews and takes it as constructive criticism and makes a change. I was leaving a movie with my family when we decided to order take out. I checked the menu on my phone so we could choose our order and noticed there weren't sizes, only 3 prices. We wanted two medium pizzas, so when I called in that's what I ordered. After I placed the order my BF wanted to verify we got the right size, so I called back and asked to confirm we got mediums and how big those were. I was told mediums are 12\", larges are 14\", and extra larges are 16\". They don't carry a \"small.\" The smallest size they offer is called a medium. Let that sink in.   Had I not called back to check, my family would have been very disappointed. The person I spoke with over the phone offered no sympathy or explanation of why the middle of the three prices on their website (again, the menu they have available to view on their website gives three PRICES, not size names or measurements) is the SMALLEST PIZZA. I get wanting to have branded sizing but even at Starbucks if you ask for a small coffee they know you want the \"tall\".   My recommendation- just call the smallest pizza you offer a \"small,\" the middle size a \"medium,\" and the largest a \"large.\" Or call them 12\", 14\", 16\" and know that if someone asks for a medium, they want a 14\". Also, and this is important, put that information on your website, not just the prices.   I love this place and I hate to criticize, but I doubt I'm the only one this has happened to.",

Wanted a calzone because I haven't had one in so long, but ultimately I don't like vegan cheeses (except nut cheeses like cashew and almond) so I got the ravioli. It came with tomato sauce, tofu filling and garlic bread. For some reason I had it in my head that they would have a cream sauce, there was no reason for this, so I was a little disappointed when I saw the tomato sauce. That was my own fault for not asking and just expecting it to be a certain way. I didn't think to ask but should have asked if they would consider doing a cashew cheese option in the future. The dish was really good, couldn't finish the whole thing so did have leftovers. Would come here again, they have vegan pizza, apps, and baked ziti too so plenty more to try!",

Pining (yearning deeply) for my wife, as we enjoy our evening together in this beautiful Friday evening.  It was hard to withhold my emotions when the apartment across the street, brought back a memory of what seemed like ages past.  I was in college then, and I was picking up some friends at that complex - since I was always the designated driver. As I waited for my friends to get ready, I would sing this song out in the balcony.   And when my friends came out of their apartment, they would immediately make fun of me stating, \"There goes Stephen again singing to the trees!\" They'd get a big laugh out of it, and encourage me to quit singing and go meet some girls.   Little did they know that my heart was already smitten by then, and all these years later, that girl sits across from me to this very day! Many years may have passed, but the passing of time hasn't diminished my passion for her.   Her presence still moves me in ways that I can never explain, nor ever take for granted!  We wound up here because this was finals week, and she wasn't wanting to endure the normal prolonged wait for any of our regular haunts in Mid-Town Phoenix. Also, we just wanted a change in venue, and the promise of Live Music was as much a draw, as the promise of great pizza and wings.  We ordered a Large Special with Mild Wings. For added measure, we also ordered a small dinner salad.  Juan, our server, was just so friendly. He was polite, prompt, and propitious. He was attentive to all the pertinent details regarding our dining experience, and was careful enough to explain all the particulars. He really seemed like he enjoyed what he did, and it really did show.  An added bonus to our dining experience was the addition of the promised Live Music entertainment. A pretty young lady, with an angelic voice, was singing a variety of songs while playing her guitar. Her musical accompaniment was a gentleman playing a Yamaha Keyboard, who at times also sang the background vocals.   Both entertainers were very adept at their craft, and the variety of their selection of music was quite pleasing - especially some of the love songs that she belted out. It truly made for a wonderful backdrop to our overall experience.  When the pizza and the wings arrived, they were as good as the other reviewers had mentioned. Perhaps, not the very best that we have ever tasted, but certainly well above average.  We like thin crust pizza, with all the toppings, and the crust not being overdone. And our pizza was just perfect in this regard - neither under-cooked or overcooked. This then, resulted in the toppings retaining their wonderful flavor; as well as, the crust not having that burnt taste that often accompanies a poorly prepared pizza.  The sauce on the wings were not overly saliferous, which enabled my wife to enjoy them - even though she doesn't often eat wings. This was a  good testament to their moderation when preparing the wings bathed in hot sauce.  It was just a perfect dining experience to share with my Beloved!  And as we walked up to pay at the front counter; the manager, the other servers, and Juan all asked us if we enjoyed our dining experience. It's one thing to ask, but they all seemed so sincere about their inquiry that it gave us a warm feeling that this place not only serves great food, has great entertainment on the weekends, but they also have staff and management that truly cares about their customer.  This may not be the fanciest, or largest dining establishments in the area; but their diminutive building size belies the immensity of their caring service!",

Placed online order on Valentine's Day and I expected a longer wait. It's a busy night, I get it, but after an hour and a half wait I called to make sure everything was ok and was explained it was busy, the online order system sometimes doesn't work, and my order was next to go out. After 2 hours from order time it showed up. Fine. Water under the bridge.   Tonight ordered again and basically the same thing happened. Had to call 20 minutes after expected delivery to make sure they received the order, and was told it was out and should be 5 or 10 minutes. By this point I'm annoyed but hungry so wait another 20. At least they beat their last time by 20 minutes.   A side salad was missed, my sandwich seemed like it was soaking in itself for an hour and the pasta ordered was soggy and just kinda gross. Strike out for now.  Until they fix their issues I'll be staying away.",

    "text": "We placed an order online, which was set to arrive at 7:06pm. When it didn't arrive, we waited ten minutes to give leeway since it was raining. When we called we were put on hold, only to be told at 7:20 that our pizza would be here in 15 minutes, but that they forgot to send part of our order. We were also told that this was the fault of the online system, and that they were really busy. It is 7:30 and I'm typing this still waiting for my pizza. We weren't offered any discount for the prolonged delivery time or  for our order not coming all at once.  7:35 and still no pizza.  7:40 and my pregnant in my third trimester self is starting to feel more monster than human as my hangry-ness elevates to a thus far inexperienced level.  7:45 and I'm regretting already tipping online, only to remember that it's not the delivery person's fault and I need to be nice to them still when (if) they come with our food.  7:50 and I'm thinking maybe this is a conspiracy to make everyone ordering pizza instead fast for the beginning of Lent.  7:55 and I'm starting to have hallucinations that I hear a car pulling up to my house. Every time a neighbor drives by I get a tiny sparkle of hope that quickly turns into a little rage flame. My sweet husband and dog are on our rainy porch looking forlornly out into our street waiting for the food to come.  8:00 Eff it. I have nothing left to say about the store's far too Einstein-ian perspective on time.  8:05 and I'm on hold again to cancel. I was offered $10 off and a free medium pizza next time (why not for this order?) For double the time.  8:12 and as we are pulling out to get food the delivery driver pulls up, I go to tell him we canceled the order, but he told me that the manager called him and told him to give us the food and a refund in cash. Well done on the recovery!  8:15 and I'm enjoying what really is some of the best pizza in Phoenix. Thank you for stepping up in a great way (even at the very end) and to the awesome delivery driver.  Minus one star for DESPERATELY needing to update your online ordering system. But this is about food, and your pizza is the best.",

It's a cozy little bistro with its own parking area - a plus for this part of 7th Avenue. The staff is very friendly and service was quick.  My order, penne al greco (I chose the gluten-free option with brown rice penne), had feta, spinach, calamata olives, sun dried tomatoes, and zucchini; it can only be described as heavenly.  It was truly ambrosia, and I chose beer as my nectar. I'm looking forward to trying more dishes at this restaurant really soon!",

I would like to say that the taste and quality do not match the price.  If the management is paying attention, I would like to suggest that you do something amusing and put bible quotes, or something along those lines, on your pizza boxes since you are 'heavenly'.

    "text": "Pizza Heaven has been on my list to try for quite some time now & I honestly haven't gone because I initially thought it would be more on the comfort food side rather than healthy quality food, boy was I wrong.  Last Saturday night after I over worked out myself, my body just needed some... CARBS!!! I decided to finally give Pizza Heaven a try. I was hesitant at first & I asked the waitress too many questions. My diet is vegan so I am always used to fresh quality food & as of a couple of months ago, I dropped sugar out of my diet as well. I was hesitant on the vegan cheese, because it stated that it was soy so I wasn't sure if it was non-gmo or if it contained sugar. The waitress was amazing, she brought me out a folder that had all the ingredients of the foods that they use. The vegan cheese brand is Follow Your Heart & it did not have any added sugar nor genetically modified ingredients. I started to be more opened to this menu & decided to order a vegan calzone w/ mushrooms, onions, & spinach.   Oh my gosh, DELICIOUS! And, it's also huge so I will have lunch for a few days too. The calzone bread was amazing & it only contained four ingredients, sugar not being one of them. It was topped off with EVOO, not butter, so it was just as vegan as it could be. The sauce was amazing, it complimented the calzone perfectly.  I talked to the owner for quite a bit, who is wonderful. She informed me that her French fries are not fried in the same frier where wings or other meat products are fried. That is beyond amazing because not many restaurants will invest in a separate frier to accommodate to their vegan population, not even big cooperate restaurants, & I know this for a fact. She also uses purified water when she cooks & not tap, she is very passionate about her business & the quality of her ingredients.  I cannot wait to go back. This was exactly what my body needed last Saturday. I really enjoyed my experience & the amazing food.",

I had no idea so when I go to the restaurant and was served a glass of their house chianti- which I'd recommend highly. I was given great service through out the entire meal and they were so great in making me feel special on my birthday! I did't even mention yet that they have GREAT vegan options! If you are a vegan/vegetarian you know how hard it is to go out to eat, but I was able to get an appetizer, entree and delicious vegan cheesecake dessert without hassle.

It appears to have been an issue with a phone outage and Patricia wasn't contact by Yelp about it.  So I guess I need to give Yelp a 1 star review!!  Patricia has made me an offer for a free entree for my troubles and due to this I will change my review to 3 stars.  Once I order from the Bistro I will change the review again based on what looks like really good food.  Thank you, Patricia, for your prompt and friendly response!!!  Received my order today and it was DELICIOUS.  I love the chicken on the salad, very flavorful and moist!!!  Thanks again to Patricia and I will definitely be ordering again soon.",

Upon entering we found that there was an area to wait for take out orders and small adjoining dining area that we found dim and cozy.  Pizza Heaven not only has Follow Your Heart soy cheese but also vegan sausage.  In addition, if you're looking for gluten free crust they've got you covered. Personally I've never been a fan of sausage so there was no interest for me to try the vegan sausage, but I did go for my trusty stand by of double pineapple.    The pizza was truly awesome and it was nice to have a bit of a change having the cheese since it had been so long. Note: from what I could see the smallest pizza I could get was a 12 inch, which is a size my husband and I would usually share.  My husband went non-vegan calzone that was HUGE and plenty for 2 meals, but he was pretty darn happy with his choice too.",

While the owner had NO SERVERS she got us our drinks and took out order without any attitude, or bad tone. She was so helpful and courteous and quick. We weren't the only customers there so her speedy service was amazing. The food was amazing, as usual, the service was great(considering), and the owner was incredible.

No one was around. I waited some more... No one was around. Finally a kid comes out and asks what I need. I tell him, he gives me my order and then I pay and then I leave. The staff seems unfriendly and the establishment felt uninviting.   This is not pizza or any edible form of what any Italian would call pizza. No passion, no care, no zest for or importance placed on quality of ingredients.  Really? I cannot be the lone wolf that tastes how bad this is? Lack of quality.   I am sorry to be so harsh but it just gets annoying to see all of these business get away with mediocrity. Sometimes I feel like we need a champ. Someone to step up and fight for the little guy. Well here it is.... \"Rocky music playing in the background\"   Don't go. If you like pizza and respect yourself then do not go. Raise your hands high turn around and walk away.   Sorry, not sorry.

I've ordered the soy cheese and soy sausage three times - once was it made well.  I'm not a fan of so-called real pizza and I'll bet the traditional pizza there is good. BUT If a restaurant charges these higher price for gluten & soy options (of which I'll pay) - you'd better do them at a C level not D-.  4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options.

A favorite of mine up until I quit eating meat is their Italian Salad, which is loaded with cold cuts of salami, pepperoni and cheeses. I MISS IT SO MUCH!!!   For dessert you should order the brownie ala mode. At one point we were ordering it every other day, it's THAT tasty.   The service here is always on point.

We had to constantly track down our waitress for water and basically anything else we needed because we were not checked on once the entire time we were there. I am not sure if it is because we went later in the evening but, I do have to mention the waitress seemed overwhelmed.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. As a vegan it was challenging for me to find a pizza that reminded me of the \"real thing\". I had come to terms with knowing that I would never find a decent equivalent of my all-time favorite food. All the other vegan options I had tried really just made me sad, even NYPD had an okay option for me but the \"cheese\" would stick to my teeth. Then I found out Pizza Heaven Bistro has a whole vegan menu and although I was skeptical at first, I'm very happy to announce that I finally found a delicious pizza suitable for my lifestyle. I highly recommend it along with their other Vegan Options. I have been eating there like 2-3 times a week since I first went and I haven't tired of it, nor do I think I will.",

Mainly because of the crust (too hard, flavorless) and lack of sauce (could've used more), the toppings were great though (we got the veggie pizza). Our server was good, attentive, funny, helpful in answering our questions. I did find the vegan veggie balls to be absolutely fantastic! The vegan cheesecake was eh (too dry/flavorless).  The vegan baked ziti was pretty good too. Overall it was just ok for me. I'm kinda picky when it comes to pizza and the crust and sauce I feel make it amazing or just bleh.",

If I didn't know I was eating Vegan, I would not have known I was eating Vegan.  That is seriously how good the food is here.   Shared the Vegan Queen Margherita Pizza and just WOW! The cheese they use was incredible.  The tomatoes were so flavorfully sweet and fresh and had the most beautiful bright red color.  Tomatoes just don't taste like this but they actually take the time to marinate them before adding them to this pizza.  Who does that?  Thankfully, they do!  Plus, OMG, they even add an abundant amount of (chiffonade) fresh basil and it was amazing!!! It looked and tasted beautiful!  The crust was as good as it gets also.  It is obviously, homemade and stretched.  The crust made this pizza spectacular! The Vegan Ziti with Soy Sausage was another dish that you would not know is Vegan. This is a spicy dish so if you like spice, this is a must try. I literally thought they gave us the regular and not the Vegan.  That is how good it was.  They individually make the pasta so not premade and scooped out onto a plate.  It is freshly baked and worth the extra wait to get freshly made food here.   The Vegan Veggie Balls are another must try! They are definitely fresh made here!  You can look at them and taste that they are.  You can choose from 3 sauces and we chose the buffalo and loved it! If you don't like spice, they have a vegan ranch option or marinara.   This is not the place to bring your screaming hungry kids because they take the time to prepare the freshest tastiest food from scratch so it takes time for that.  This is not slow service.  Don't confuse it with that.  Just like it takes time to cook a good meal at home, it takes that same amount of time here.  So just sit back and relax and enjoy your company while you wait and enjoy your meal when ever it arrives.",

The only thing I didn't like was you can't do half and half on an order because the server said the owner doesn't like doing that. However, since it was my first time, I didn't mind paying an extra $1 to get 2 separate orders so I can try the different flavors. I also got fried zucchini as an appetizer and it was deliciously fresh. Be careful to not burn your tongue because everything will be hot and freshly made.

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time, seeing as though they have options for vegetarians like me. We get there and there are only about six people in the restaurant. Our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered the veggieball parmigiana , now here's the tricky part apparently. All I asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese. I wanted the  whole sandwich to be meat free and just have non vegan cheese. Simple enough right? Wrong, I thought the server's head was about to pop off. He simply could not grasp this simple order, the sandwich comes with a side so I ordered the salad. So time goes on and he brings out my order, ya not so much. He brings out veggieballs I will give him that, but it's an appetizer not the sandwich I ordered. So he takes it back and brings out my salad. Then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries. I didn't ask for fries I asked for the salad side. So now I'll be charged for a salad and fries. I'm with my boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian, and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable. It wasn't a busy night and I was not being unreasonable. I will never be back here again.",

Not only do they have vegan options, they have a full vegan menu that accompanies their standard menu. This place is an awesome go-to regardless of dietary preferences, but don't knock the veg options. I've had other guests stop and ask what I'm eating because it looks so good, only to find out I've got the vegan option! I definitely recommend the stuffed sandwiches. They're HUGE (I always have enough to save half for later) and only end up costing about $7-8. Plus, Pizza Heaven offers both cheesecake and angel bites (fried dough with chocolate sauce or agave), which are delicious and vegan.",

Too cheesy? Just like their amazing pizza! We were greeted with friendly faces and you can tell that they loved their jobs! We were immediately seated at a table, I asked our server if we could move to a booth as a family just left and the live music was a tad bit too loud. She quickly cleaned up the booth and let us move! The music was still a bit loud, but it was much more cozier in the corner booth.   We ordered a pepperoni pizza, mozzarella sticks and baked medium chicken wings. A-H-MAZING. Their marinara is homemade and delicious. Their wing sauce had just the perfect kick and the pizza was absolutely delicious, so ooey and gooey!  Our server was awesome. Sadly I do not remember her name. But she was on top of her game. Very welcoming and personable. She checked in on us a lot but not too much. And she didn't ask how the food was as we took a bite ;)   By far the best part about this experience was finding out it is family owned and operated. The owner actually checked in on us as well.   It was a great experience for a great prize. We spent under $40 and found the perfect date night spot!  I am from Chicago, so I know what good pizza is, and this was fabulous.",

Also stoked because they deliver to my neighborhood, which I would've guessed is outside the delivery area.   Pizza was good. Crust good, not too doughy or crispy. I would suggest not going too crazy on the custom toppings because they can add up and be pricy. Luckily the girl at the counter was nice and warned us the pizza we were crafting was going to end up being pretty expensive, so we took her suggestion to revise and it was much more reasonable. They're definitely my go to pizza in the neighborhood. Have ordered from them several times and they're always consistent.  Their wings are good, salads are good--really haven't ordered anything that's been a disappointment yet. They also have a good reasonably priced lunch slice special. Definitely worth stopping by if you're craving a slice and in the area.",

The quality of the food never deviates from the first fateful time I tried it in the summer of '16. Whenever I'm in the mood for pizza or a calzone or one of their awesome apps, but also not really feelin' dining in, I'll call in an order, pick it up, and enjoy it at home. However, the last 4 times I've been here was to sit down (and again, the quality of the food was awesome every time), but the service was down right horrible. Once, me and my friends were seated at a dirty table. Another time, I had to get up to get us some silverware. And on another occasion, we had to repeat our drink orders 2-3 times. Mind you, most of the drinks ordered were water. Last time, the server seemed pretty aloof and if someone in our party got up (i.e. restroom) he just swooped right in and cleared their plate. No questions asked, even with a half-eaten piece of pizza on the plate. Since it wasn't my piece of pizza that was cleared (sorry, C), and the food is still good, none of this is enough to deter me from eating here but I've pretty much decided that to go orders is what I'll be doing in the future.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying the vegan menu is excellent! I honestly did like everything and I would recommend vegans going there for sure because they use better ingredients than most other vegan restaurants. I had the vegan meatballs and they offer a few sauces to try with it and they were all good.   I'm also a meat eater so I ordered the cajun chicken alfredo because thats what was recommended popular. I tried it and it was just grainy to each bite and not at all what I expected. If you like cheese with a side of spice and chicken then this would be your go to (but remember; grainy texture).   I politely told my server that I was not satisfied with my order and to just swap it out with the spaghetti and meatballs. He completely understood (from what I could tell) and about 10 minutes later I got my new order. My first bite was amazing, totally worth it. After a couple more bites, even better. But this is what got to me, and this is EVERYONE'S worst fear at a restaurant. I spooled my fork to get a nice spoonful of everything and stared at my next bite and saw a nice thick black hair in it!!  This was flipping gross and what was worse is that it didn't look like it fell out, it looked like it was plucked out and placed in my plate because a nice white ROOT tip was on the end. I stayed calm (unlike most people) and I already felt bad I swapped out my plate but my friend said something to our waiter and he apologized and said he would he get my friend dessert (I guess for us all??). Instead of me FREAKING OUT, I was calm and making it an eventful experience. At the end he still billed me for the appetizer I ordered earlier (which I know is fair, but at the same time; a hair. come on.)   I will not be going here again because aside of the big thick black hair in my spaghetti and meatballs, I left hungry. (They didnt offer another plate for me to have or anything).",

You'll easily eat through the whole plate with a few people. Too many for just a single person though.  This is a great place for a cozy dinner out at a great-tasting, casual Italian bistro.

They've only accidentally given us real cheese on a pizza once (out of the hundreds of times we've ordered food here), but as always check your order before you leave with takeout! In addition to pizza they have huge hot sandwiches. These vegan options are not healthy, but they are amazingly good. And this is a great place for mixed families/groups to go because they've got vegan and non-vegan options and everybody's happy.  Our favs: Salad - so we start off feeling healthy, and have extra vegan ranch.   Veggieballs - vegan \"meat ball\" appetizer - fried veggie balls with Buffalo wing sauce (we prefer over red sauce) and vegan ranch dressing. Not what we expected - they're not fake meat. They're almost like Pakora's with little chunks of veggies in them.   Vegan Vegetarian pizza - check out the different crust options. We prefer the regular crust and if we have extra vegan ranch, that crust gets dipped in it.  Vegan Delight - this cheesy, sausage and veggie pizza has great flavor. The sausage texture and spices are very realistic - I'm not advocating for tricking any meat eaters, but they would probably enjoy this and not know the difference.  Vegan Sausage Parmigiano - huge hot sandwich with vegan Italian sausage, vegan cheese, and veggies. Half of one of these can be a meal, but you will eat the whole thing without regret.  Angel Bites - this is basically a huge pile of donut holes with powered sugar and chocolate syrup. And like donuts, they aren't as good as left overs, but you will not have room to eat them all by yourself so get them to share with about 6 other people. There's also cheesecake, and it might actually be the healthiest thing on the menu other than salad.  They can also make vegan breadsticks by request.",

    "text": "The food was decent - we had pizza and salad - nothing special. Impressed by the gluten-free and vegan options. What really disappointed me was the customer service. Early on in our meal, when the waiter was delivering the salad, somehow the dressing flew off the salad plate (it was in a container) and landed on the floor by my feet, getting dressing all over my skirt, shoes, and feet. I had to spend 5 minutes in the bathroom cleaning myself up before I could go out and enjoy my meal.   The thing is, I don't have a problem with mistakes. People make mistakes all the time. But besides his profuse apology for the mistake, there was no action taken to rectify the situation. When our bill came, there wasn't a single discount or credit. In my estimation, when you work in customer service, you have a responsibility to make sure the customer is happy and wants to return to your establishment again. I was not left feeling this way, and for that I am very disappointed.",

However, the service staff gets overwhelmed easily and it's hard to get refills sometimes, we've waited a long time for our bill more than once, and there doesn't seem to be a good reason for the delays.  The food is aces, and they have terrific options for vegans, unlike most pizza places.  EDIT: We ate there tonight, and it was really, really busy, but they did a much better job of attending to us, so I added a star.  I'm a fair-minded person.  The food really is aces.",

Nothing special but still good, decent food.  Pizza had a good amount of cheese and not too much sauce.  Wings were just standard. Nothing too special about them  Chicken alfredo was good but only had enough room for a couple bites.  Anyways, in review. Good, but not great.",

The garlic bread with Follow Your Heart cheese was really, really good.  We forgot to order the Mediterranean Pizza with whole wheat crust, but it was still good.  The veggie balls starter is a potato/veggie fritter and very good.  The prosecco is a good deal.  The salad was very nice and big.  Will absolutely go back!!!",

The owner, Patricia, was very attentive and accommodating since we sat outside and one of the heaters wasn't working. It didn't stop there, though. She and her staff were great, even the in-training waiter that served us. The baked ziti, spaghetti with meatballs, slice of pizza, jalapeno poppers, and angel bites were all perfect for us. The restaurant claims to make everything in-house and the taste of it made it hard to deny. Great local Phoenix spot!",

It was all extremely delicious! The waitress was wonderful and the food was great. I believe the owner or manager was going around and talking with customers and making sure they were having a good time.

The Vegan delight pizza was really delicious. The cheese wasn't slimy and greasy like some vegan cheeses. They use Follow your heart cheese and it was very flavorful. topping were spot on. Soy sausage was surprisingly delicious, the taste was very similar to meat sausage. I even enjoyed it and im not vegan my girlfriend is. Service was very attentive and knowledgeable. he was even kind enough to ask the cook what kind of cheese was on the pizza. All in all i give this place two thumbs up and will be dining here again soon!",

I called at exactly 10:30am when they opened on Saturday morning, and the person on the phone was so awesome and patient with me, not only agreeing to include a personalized note (which I was hesitant to do and he convinced me it was a cute idea), but he let me think about what to write and call back when I finally figured it out.

    "text": "Vegan pizza..that's actually good?! I am shocked and very pleased! I love pizza and I am vegetarian so I do eat cheese, but I try not to eat too much dairy. I've been searching for a place that makes dairy free pizza that's actually good, and I'm glad I could have it here! I went with my sister who is lactose intolerant and my mom who has celiacs and can't have gluten. We were all so excited to try this place after hearing how good it was, and weren't let down! We got zucchini fries and vegan breadsticks for my sister and I, my mom and sister got a gluten free pizza with vegan cheese and basil, and I got a vegan calzone with tomatoes. My mom really enjoyed the pizza! My sister wasn't crazy about the cheese on the pizza but loved the appetizers. My calzone was the size of a football I couldn't even come close to finishing it and I usually have a pretty big appetite!! And it's only $11 for that massive calzone. I couldn't even tell it was vegan either (until later when I ate it cold and the vegan cheese kinda cools differently). But so good! And the server there was awesome, double checking about everything to make sure our food fit our dietary restrictions. Definitely recommend to vegans in Phoenix!",

He was literally yelling the whole time, so so annoying!!! He couldn't read his own handwriting after writing our order and had to ask us what we wanted again. We had a party of 8, and 7 out of the 8 were served around 10 minutes before the 8th person. By that time, our food was no longer hot. The waiter never asked how the food was, or checked to see if we needed refills. The food was mediocre, lacking flavors, and seasoning. It was very expensive considering how mediocre it was. I didn't want to tip because I was so disappointed with the service, but they forced us to tip because we had a party of 8. I won't come here again or recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Oddly enough, I came here twice in two days after driving past it for months on end. Sometimes you just need Italian, I guess.   The first time was near the end of the night on a Thursday. I ordered the sausage parm sandwich. I expected a whole sausage on a bun, with cheese and sauce. Instead, I got a bit of sliced up sausage with cheese and lots of sauce on a giant bun. I ripped open the bun, laid the two sides flat, and evened out the insides on it. I basically had french bread pizzas. Not exactly what I'd wanted, but it was fine.   The next day, my coworkers decided to go to lunch here, so I thought I'd give the slices a try. Those were solid. Two slices of pepperoni pizza, which filled me up and were on special. Good deal.   Both times, the servers weren't very attentive. At the lunch, I waited 20 minutes for the server to walk by before I finally got up and handed him my card. He seemed overwhelmed, but there were only two other tables with people in there.   I'm down to come back regardless. I like pizza and their wing prices don't look so bad either.",

My Caesar salad barely had any dressing on it so when I asked for a tiny bit more dressing I was shocked to see they charged me $1.50 on the bill - overall lack luster appearance. The pizza was just ok, good flavor but the crust doesn't hold up.    In addition I was exhausted after a 12 hour shift and did the math on our bill wrong because I wanted to get out of there - so we will see if our serve is honest and actually puts the tipped amount or what I totaled it as, our server was Yaslin - if not I will Be making a call.",

He was so upbeat, helpful, and kind. He made our dining experience a fantastic one! Recommending this restaurant to anyone who appreciates old-World Italian charm and delicious food.

In my opinion there were too many, or not cut finely enough, because I could actually chew little chunks of garlic which was unpleasant to taste.

The pizza was delicious and tasted great the next day, absolutely loved it!  My buddy had told me they had awesome sandwiches as well.  So today I decided to bring two friends and make the trip to eat there, it unfortunately was not the same experience..  I ordered the Veggieball's rolled in buffalo sauce as an appetizer, came out quick and tasted very good!   Based off this I decided to get the Veggieball Parmegeano Sub with fries.   When the food comes out she puts it down and I wait for it to cool off only to notice this was the wrong Sandwich, I had gotten the \"veggie baked sub\" by mistake, when I lifted up the sub, the marinara was so watery that it caused the bread to turn to mush and instantly the Sandwich fell apart..  At this point I had to get up to FIND our waitress and let her know I got the wrong order. She offers to get me my correct order witch ended up taking quite a while.  By the time my correct order came both of my friends were done with their food. The sandwich itself was forgettable. Pretty much almost no marinara, and the veggie balls were way over fried and crunchy.   After it was over I had to once again GET UP to find our waitress (twice nand get a box and our check.  And when we get the bill I notice nothing was comped. No discount or appetizer taken off for the inconvenience.. Nothing done to make it right. Full charged for everything.   Moral of the story is from now on I'm going to stick to the pizza, and stick to carry out instead of dining in. Very disappointed that today was the opposite experience that I had from the first time.",

We got the Vegan Delight which comes with savory soy crumbles, the vegan mozzarella, and subbed bell peppers for pineapple. Also tried the vegan BBQ pizza which was a home run. (Don't forget to grab some VEGAN ranch). A must-stop for any vegan! Thanks, Pizza Heaven, for the best vegan pizza we've ever had.",

    "text": "I wish I could remember or count how many places I have had pizza, probably be in the hundreds.  Well, I love pizza so when I hear about a place or someone suggests going out for dinner, a pizza place (or Italian) is always at the top of my suggestions. So, there is the background.  Pizza Heaven is a pretty nice place. I was there with a group, primarily senior types who are usually not very adventurous and stick to bland, minimally spiced food. What they mostly had, or appeared to have, was just that. So, I ordered a pizza and piled on the red pepper.  The pizza was good on a scale of 1 -10, I would give it about a 7.5. Nothing really stood out, but it was basically put together well. I tend to rate pizza on the high scale as I can usually find something redeeming about most pizza. However, if it is a 5 or below, I would never return. I think I found one of those places about a year ago. Well, if it is a above a 7, I consider the pizza to be good enough to return for and at least give it another try.  Pizza Heaven Bistro had a bit of atmosphere, was doing a pretty good business with casual guests and a birthday party going on one of the side areas. The party goers seemed to be having a good time.  Service was good, food was served quickly and the place was clean. They had a outdoor area, but it was too cold to be out there. Anyway, a good enough place to give a try.",

Being a Friday evening, it was busy and loud, but that didn't bother us at all. What felt like a little hectic of a start (lots of people in a small space) turned into a very enjoyable evening. From the live music, to the huge vegan section of the menu, delicious food (we had the vegetarian pizza, and salad with vegan ranch) and a personal table visit from the owner-- pizza heaven won me over!   Vegan Foodies- it's a must try!",

    "text": "A fun lunch joint close to the Central corridor, but with restrictive parking, so their delivery service is handy for those in-office events.  The menu is easy to navigate, and if you're a \"slice and a soda\" kind of guy, this is your place. Well, two slices, anyway. The counter help was efficient and suggested several combinations he preferred, which we fond helpful.  We were sorted through the ordering/payment process in under 30 seconds, start to finish.   I had a great Chicken Florentine sandwich, and my companion ordered the Meatball Parmigiana. Both were a little slow in their preparation, but were put up to the window piping hot and with a fresh bag of Lay's potato chips.  The chicken was properly cooked, and the sub roll it was served on was slightly crunchy, but mostly chewy, and tasted fresh-baked. The mozzarella was a tad lacking, and the mushrooms tasted blanched, but the fresh spinach made up for all that.  The meatball parm was a delight, as the meatballs lacked that disgusting MSG-esque aftertaste and filler so common with cheap, frozen commissary-style meatballs. The sauce, well, that was just delightful - a little acidic and sweet, but tasting fully of ripened tomatoes all the way. This sandwich was adorned with kalamata olives and roasted peppers. Yum.  The ambiance is \"deli-meets-Olive Garden\" (in a way), and count on waiting in line for the bathroom facilities when it's lunch rush. There is room to have a bunch of people in the back room, but it will get incredibly noisy. Screaming children have no place here.  Bottom line:  Reasonably priced, decent ambiance, awful parking, delightful staff.",

I've been to this place several times... it's family owned, it's clean, but pizza heaven it is not.  Their pizza is good and nothing more.  I liked it, but it wasn't out of this world, I had the Pizza Bianca and it does not deserve 5 stars. It's OK. that's it.  I really don't understand how places like this on yelp get such high reviews, but I have a theory:  People who do not venture out beyond their safe zone develop a relative reality.  Let's just say this about Pizza Heaven: There wasn't anything bad about the place.  They have music sometimes, but it's a duo fronted by the owner's son.  They're so-so, just like the pizza, no wrong notes, but I won't be buying their album soon.  I wouldn't come here unless I was invited by someone, in which I would still come, but I can think of 20 pizza places that are better than this and many of those 20 are cheaper.",

If I can make a better pizza by throwing a frozen one in the oven, that doesn't bode well for your restaurant.  Will not be returning.",

The Baked Ziti is my favorite and my husband loves the Calzone. We both love the pizza and the baked wings as well.  I'm drooling as I type this.   Our love of this place does not stop at the food though. We actually had Erick Hasbun, the owners son play at our wedding and had the food catered from there as well. They brought it all the way to Gilbert and it was amazing! Erick is an awesome singer and guitar player and we couldn't be happier with how the food turned out. Everyone loved it! The Spinach Chicken Alfredo (I think thats what it was) was something we had at the wedding that I had never tried and it was amazing too! That pan was eaten up first! That was a hit!  I will end this by saying Thank You Pizza Heaven for always being worth the drive! Can't wait until we can make it down there again very soon!  Thanks! Kathy and Bob Vidican",

There was nothing special about the gf pizza, the mozzarella cheese was barely past melted. I also ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta which was #1 way hotter than it needed to be (only took a few bites) and was brought to my table with 2 pieces of garlic bread (shoved into the pasta an sauce) which makes me wonder if the kitchen staff know anything about gluten sensitivity, even though the website seems to boast about their gluten free and vegan options. The waiter was polite and did remove the pasta from my bill which I greatly appreciate! My brother and his wife had the Chicken Parmesean which was NOT homemade. The chicken was more of a chicken patty or chicken nugget type of texture! The frys and the wings were also noticeably from a bag. Anyway, if I could give negative stars I would, I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

We had the chicken alfredo pizza, which I was skeptical of. Alfredo has a tendency to be rich and over used. But it was a perfect balance. Absolutely wonderful. The Queen Margherita pizza was awesome also. Again the ingredients were fresh and flavorful and the cheese was awesome (they use buffalo mozzarella). I say pizza is like sex.

    "text": "My wife and two kids went to PHB on 5/8/15.  We were in town picking up our son from ASU.  Our first choice was a one hour wait. So we went there and arrived at 9:25 pm, it closed at 10:30.  Our hostess set us down in the main dining room.  There were 6 other tables being used, and two or three had dirty dishes from previous patrons.   We were asked if we wanted something to drink, my kids had sodas, my wife and I had a beer and asked for a glass of water.  The sodas and beers arrived and we asked for the water again.   10 minutes later our waiter arrived and took our order.  We asked for the water again, and he said it would be there shortly. They brought an appetizer to our table, but no water, so we asked again..this time he brought it for us. We waited and waited for our food, and it did not arrive, but the waiter came to see what kind of dressing our son wanted on his salad.  We informed him that he had not ordered a salad. He had our table confused with someone else.  During this time, there was another couple sitting next to us, that was trying to get someones attention to pay their bill.  Finally someone came by. Our food arrived at about 10:25.  My lasagna was in a dish, tasted like Mona Lisa's (costco brand) lasagna, that they cut a slice and put into a dish and put it in the broiler.  Everything was totally melted down, the pasta was so over cooked...it was not very good.  The pizza was just basic pizza. About 10:45 our bill arrived.  BEFORE THAT NO ONE CAME BY TO SEE HOW OUR FOOD WAS OR IF WE NEEDED ANYTHING ELSE.. We put our credit card on top of the folder visible to anyone walking by.  OH YEAH, when our food arrived we were the only ones left in the restaurant, and they started cleaning the place up.  knocking dishes and glasses all around us, then they started to mop the place with some foul smelling cleanser, which is probably OK as long as no one is there eating or digesting their food. We waited about five minutes for someone to pick up our bill, finally we just got up and paid it and left.  Terrible service...Food, just ok..nothing special...We should have stayed at Oregano's down the street.",

The pizza is amazing...the prices are great and the employees are awesome.    Pizza Heaven offers wheat crusts on request and has a really substantial list of vegetarian options.  The sandwiches are tasty and the pasta selections are generous and definitely hit the spot.  The staff is great - The owner is very consistent when it comes to making her way to each table to welcome the guests and ensure everything is satisfying.  I would be remised if I didn't mention the waiter Juan who has been there for a number of years...I don't think anything compares to his cuteness -and to top it off, he's attentive, and kind.  Last night we dined in and ordered a large 3-toping pizza, two salads, two cokes and a beer and when we left we were more than satisfied with the food and extremely satisfied with the bill as there are very few places left that you can get a solid dinner and enjoyable atmosphere for under 30.00!  So can I just say, when your looking for some good eats and you're in the Central Phoenix area...you should definitely check this place out.    Word?  Word!",

    "text": "I moved to Phx in July 2001, having only visited once during December with friends from Ohio/Michigan. When it came time to escape Ohio, initially with a very good friend who wanted to move to Tucson to acclimate us to city life (I was raised in a village of 500+- people, including the rural setting of my parents) and within five years move to Phoenix, just so we didn't suffer culture shock. Remember, I'd only been in Phx for 3 days up to that point in my life, with neither friend nor family binding me to Arizona. However, he decided the week before our departure date that he wasn't ready to move so far away from family. I, however, had turned in my month's notice to both my full-time job as a journalist and part-time job at Wal-Mart (don't judge me! The employee discount was worth it) so had to make a decision: Tucson or Phoenix. It was during the final minutes, literally, that I mapped out my trip to Phoenix. See, my dad's a truck driver and I have some of his ability to navigate through cities and states using this amazing invention called an atlas. Thanks to Grandma O'Neill, I had such a magical device in my possession, and wrote out in a matter of minutes the best route to drive my Kia Sportage and U-haul trailer from Northwest Ohio to Central Arizona, avoiding toll roads and steep inclines. Unfortunately, I had to drive through the panhandle of Texas, where I almost decided I'd had enough and was going to return to Ohio. But, I drove on. And on, and on...   What this has to do with Pizza Heaven is simply background information. After 2.5 days of driving and sleeping in a truck stop one night, I was ready to settle in and have a filling meal. A pizza, actually. And something that would inaugurate my coming to a new home: Mexican Pizza. Refried bean and cheese and green onions...it's a shame I couldn't find it on their menu after returning a year later. But, PH managed to offer specialty pizzas that filled that void (almost :( ) and has been a stand-by for several events at a friend's house. [My friend's house is outside their delivery range and we gladly pay the extra fee, which says a lot.]   Although I've only eaten inside the restaurant twice, and must agree that service tended to be on the slower side, this did allow our groups to mingle more and enjoy the pizza and wine at our leisure.   Thanks for the memories, Pizza Heaven. You've remained solid in my heart since the day I drove into town and stayed at the only hotel on the only street I could recall in this wonderful City.

One of the first things I noticed at Pizza Heaven was that it is family run.  It was such a pleasure to see the whole family chipping in to make such a great place, down to the son of the owner playing music for all to enjoy!  I came to Pizza Heaven specifically to try their VEGAN pizza.  I have had Vegan Cheese before and I was a little apprehensive to try it, but to my amazement it was AMAZING!  This was the first time since I have been vegan that I have had a pizza that actually tasted like a traditional pizza.  I was blown away!  The next day while I was in town I did go to Z Pizza and tried their Vegan Cheese.  Though I did also enjoy Z Pizza's establishment, hands down PIZZA HEAVEN blew their pizza away!  Sincerely,  Rick D.",

I was greeted by a stylish and friendly staff, pizza was ready within 20 minutes of my phone call, and WOW!! Such a great pie!! Fresh basil in the sauce!! A mix of nice cheeses! Great pepperoni!!! Exquisite crust!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT MOAR.",

(They only play on Fri and Sat nights...) Hey, the music isn't Top 40 radio play. But when I go there for the food, its nice to have \"life's backdrop\", (which I thoroughly enjoy, BTW) going on. And if I stop by for WiFi, which I have on occasion, I mean, really, PUT HEADPHONES ON IF IT BOTHERS YOU. lol Whats even better, if you think you can do better, liza, they always invite folks to jam with them. Overall, its a fun, family environment not intended to be a 'library', as the Ricky C put it. As a loyal customer for many years, I will miss this place when I move (Including Eric & Jimmy Lee play those oldie hits). I stand by my last review...best pizza anywhere around. Great atmosphere (yep, even the music)",

For around $5 you get a slice of pizza, salad, and drink - and for a small up charge you can get any toppings you want on your single slice. Most places in the area charge way more for pizza of this quality and you can't order just a single slice the way you like it. I'm a fan!",

    "text": "Phoenix seems to possess many pizza gems. Add this joint to that list. Most of the time I made delivery orders from these guys but occasionally I did go and eat there with friends.    Since I have been eating here for the past two years I have had a chance to sample a lot of their menu. In terms of pizza the best thing on it is the Queen Margherita. In terms of components its a fairly simple pizza: tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. However, the pizza is well put together and you can taste the quality of the ingredients. Its a little on the pricey side in my opinion but its well worth it.   My second favorite pizza is the bianca which is an amalgamation of different cheeses. They offer ricotta on the pizza for a little extra but in my opinion it takes away from the bianca experience so don't bother with it. Now the Bianca has no red sauce which means it lacks a certain zest in my opinion. This is why I recommend getting a side order of marinara  to dip the pizza in. Eat the pizza fast though because like many things it does not taste good cold.  Im doing this review ass backwards here but in terms of appetizers their mozzarella sticks are pretty damn good. Make sure to request that they are the last thing out of the oven so that they are piping hot. Their other appetizers in my opinion are not of the same caliber so I would avoid them.  If you aren't in the mood for pizza try one of there delicious calzones which you can easily make two meals out of. This place has without a doubt the best calzones in the phoenix area.  Like their appetizers Pizza Heaven's pasta dishes are not one of their strong suits and should be avoided unless you enjoy the taste of mediocrity.     Your best bet when it comes to dessert is the Chocolate Mousse which I gotta say is pretty damn good. After having ordered from them over 50 times I asked if I get any sort of reward for my commitment and so they hooked it up with a slice of the Mousse. The cheesecake on the other hand was unimpressive. If you want cheesecake go to the cheesecake factory.  On balance Pizza Heaven is a decent joint and while its pizza is far from heavenly its kinda close, like one notch above purgatory...just kidding.",

A gluten-free trifecta!  It is great to have so many options, and the pizza and honey-hot wings were fairly tasty... but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  Just a basic casual pizza spot, where you won't be terribly embarrassed if your 4-year-old throws a temper tantrum.  Umm.. not that that happened to us, or anything...

The live music was nice but lots of breaks for the singer, as she would do 1 or 2 songs and disappear for a bit and come back :20 later and do another few. Not impressed this visit.",

The atmosphere is warm and inviting with True ambience (rare in the strip mall Phoenix culture).  Orders are placed in the front and a number is provided to you.  I have to say that the guy taking the order was helpful and courteous.  I had some questions and he answered them with a smile - not an attitude!  I ended up sharing a Greek style salad (it had artichokes and a red vinegar/oil olive dressing = Greek style).  The portion was generous and the salad as delicious.  The main course was an extra large thick crust pizza.   It was cooked perfectly and the sauce was simple, yet tasty.  Pizza Heaven is suitable for adults and children alike.    I will be back.................!",

Had the lunch specials--a couple of cheese slices and a drink ($4.50, but extra for toppings) and the 1 slice (one topping), salad, and drink ($5.50). Salad was small and fresh--lettuce, tomato, carrots, and even some bacon bits! My slice was with sausage and cooked perfectly--very tasty! My partner in crime had olives and mushrooms, which looked good and there definitely weren't any complaints.  Service was great, although it seemed as though one person (Drew) was the only one there, along with the chef. The atmosphere was smallish but cozy, nice ambiance overall.  Prices are really reasonable and this place is apparently a great option for vegetarians/vegans. Will definitely go back to give the sandwiches a try when we're back in the area!

    "text": "I've tried Pizza Heaven three times (Takeout with family, lunch eat-in with co-workers & lunch eat-in with in  laws) and each time I've not been disappointed.  Quick Summary: Large portion sizes, affordable, flavorful, courteous service.  The services: Each time we have received courteous service at the counter. There is really no waiter during lunch hours, and I'm not familiar with their dinner service, so I can't speak to this. You walk in, order at the counter, get your drinks, and find a table to sit. Once the food is ready, it is brought to your table along with plates & forks.   The wait time: Medium to Long. Depending on what you order, it can be on the long side. The longest we waited was 30 minutes to get 2 veggie and 2 meatball hot stuffed sandwiches, and 1 pizza (which we requested upon ordering to have it packed as 'to go'). If you are in a hurry or have a larger group, I suggest calling ahead and placing your order for eat-in.  The food: Dedicated Vegan Menu? Yes, please. Large portion Sizes? Absolutely. Tasty, flavorful comfort food? Right on target. This place was a hit with both my carnivore family members and co-workers, and my vegan preferences! Portion sizes are in fact very large, the hot stuffed sandwiches can easily feed 2 people, and if you order the calzone make sure you are going to share!   Vegan Menu: High ratings to the vegan veggieballs - they are flavorful and full of veggies! I was expecting them to have a consistency of seitan or soy, but that is not the case (as alluded to by the name...). Must try in their hot stuffed sandwich.   Carnivore Menu: \"The Works\" pizza has an admirable # of toppings - these slices are packed with cheese, meat, and vegetables--definitely a winner. Also make sure to check out their Meatball Parmigiana hot stuffed sandwich - hefty portion of meat, sauce, and cheese - it's impressive.",

The place is pretty small and would have a hard time with a large crowd as the dining room might seat 50 people at capacity.  But the intimacy made it perfect for a family or a date night.  Oh and the jalapeno poppers were yummy too! Good job Pizza Heaven.  Ask for River too. He knows that menu in and out and will help make great suggestions.",

The menu has just enough variety to make anybody happy and if you want good pizza stop throwing your money away elsewhere and just come here.",

What yelpers in Los Angeles might rate 4 stars could be totally different from the 4 stars a place might get from locals in Phoenix and I learned that all too well during my 5 week stay in AZ.   But Pizza Heaven Bistro? It went above my expectations. At hearty servings of pasta complete with chicken and bread priced at $10, i was surprised at how good it actually was. Because sometimes quantity does not equal quality.  Must Try: Cajun alfredo with chicken pasta, Chipotle cream with chicken pasta  Although I'll probably never return to the oven that is Phoenix, if I ever did Pizza Heaven Bistro would be a place I'd come back to.",

I've passed by this place time after time; I thought it was a regular pizza place, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!!! The owner here has dedicated a portion of her menu to the vegan community, and the crazy thing is non vegans even order vegan items because they can't deny the taste, flavor and that extra umph, their secret ingredient LOVE. That goes into all her dishes made here. This place is one of, if not the only place that doesn't use diaya cheese for their vegan pizza and the difference is astronomical!!! By far one of thee best pizza I've EVER HAD vegan or not! Please treat yourself to this place it's a guilty pleasure for vegans and non vegans alike.",

My only thought is that all of the good reviews is due to the fact they have so many gluten free and vegan options, which I assume is hard to find at restaurants.    Went in tonight for dinner around 5:30pm and although there were only 4 tables filled, it took 10 mins to get seated - including 3 employees all passing by saying they would be back to help us.  Our waiter had no personality and was invisible most of the time.  We ordered mozzarella sticks to start but never got them  (I know he heard because he asked if we wanted 6 or 10).  He finally came back at the end asking how my drink was... I just wanted our check and pizza packed up so I didn't tell him how awful it was - hence the reason it was barely drank.    We got two of the smallest sized pizzas to share - Bianca was decent but tastes exactly like every other pizza places version of it.  Thin crust pepperoni was very blah.  We have at least a full pizza worth that will probably end up going to my dog or the trash in a few days.  No interest at all in eating it - not worth the calories.    I'm quite annoyed that I wasted $50 for dinner tonight.  My daughter and I always try to go to local places and want to try new places when possible.  Bad customer service + bad food = FAIL!",

She also better explained their computer system as to why she couldn't give me a refund and it made more sense. It's because they use GrubHub, a 3rd party transaction system.   She kept her word to comp our entire meal and we ordered a Margherita and Miko Miko, both larges. She apologized again and even rushed our order. It was 6:30 on a Friday night and the delivery driver was at our door by 7:15.   I appreciate owners who own their business in more ways than one. She definitely did and I'm satisfied with calling our previous experience with Pizza Heaven a \"one off.\"",

I had the beef and she had the spinach. Our waiter Lorenzo was great and was happy to provide a few suggestions for my wife.

Last night we had the opportunity to chat with the owner and we learned that our favorite vegan item, the veggieballs (a meatball alternative) are handmade every day. No wonder they're so good!! She told us she didn't like the commercially produced vegan meatballs and didn't want to serve a subpar product so she made her own veggieball recipe with fresh ingredients. They're the absolute BEST! You must try them, vegan or not.   We also learned that everything is made to order, even the angel bites (pictured). Nothing is reheated. Again, no wonder it's so darn good!!! (By the way--try the angel bites for dessert. Even the non-vegans in our group loved them.)

This time ordered wings, crispy and dude called, super late, soggy wings, no apology, no nothing.  Never again Pizza Heaven!  Honestly it's more like Pizza Purgatory!   Go eggplant yourselves!",

    "text": "My family and I purchased a Groupon for $40 worth of food for $20. We decided to celebrate my recent new job offer I accepted. We were immediately greeted by our waitress, Renee, who seated us at a table. She took our beverage order, while we perused the menu; she was back quickly with our drinks and she asked if we had any questions. We had questions about gluten free for my daughter and what recommendations she has off the menu.  My husband chose the spaghetti with meatballs, my son chose the cheese lasagna, my daughter decided on the chicken Alfredo and I selected the 10 mild chicken wings. Our order took a little longer to prepare but it was worth the wait as it arrived in large portions and piping hot. Every bite was delicious, fresh and authentic. If you enjoy eating Italian food, this place is for you: simply recipes, the finest ingredients and the nicest employees working for them. We will be back to taste more of their menu. Renee was the best waitress, always checking on us and inquiring if everything tasted good-of course it did! We highly recommend this restaurant,",

Although the waitress that serviced us was not rude she seemed to kinda disappear a lot when we needed some things.   We ordered a pizza with bacon and pepperoni. Which was really good! The dough for the pizza had a nice flavor and a 12in was enough for 3 of us along with the wings. I love that they have parmesan, crushed red peppers, and GARLIC powder. I always love when a pizza place has all three. I believe they also had oregano but it wasn't at our table. They also had a lot of vegetarian options on the menu with some vegetarian dessert options. Which was really neat to see.   We also ordered wings to go with the pizza. Unfortunately we werent allowed to try one of the wing sauces before getting it which kinda sucked. We got the hot agave bbq sauce and medium for our wings. Our party didnt really care for the agave bbq which was the one sauce we wished we were allowed to try before getting. Worth a try!",

    "text": "Pizza Heaven brings so much joy to the Phoenix vegan community. The owner has created a vegan menu that complements the normal omni menu. It's not an after-thought, it's an informed, exciting menu for those who grew up eating Italian classics.   To start - the veggie balls are incredible! They are crispy and filled with mixed veggies. I love the \"crunch\" I get when I bite into one. I'm torn between the marinara and Buffalo sauces. Both are so good! While I've tried the vegan pizzas, sausage parm sandwich, calzone and ravioli before, the vegan baked ziti is hands down one of the best vegan pasta dishes I've ever had. A good baked ziti is a work of art. Theirs is a Da Vinci. I think they make the sausage in house. The cheese is Follow Your Heart, which melts well and doesn't have too much flavor. They somehow managed to get the right crispness to flavorful grease ratio - just like classic baked ziti. The bread they serve with it just acts as a sponge to scoop up the remaining sauce/sausage combo at the end of the meal. Oh, and it's HUGE. It's usually at least three meals for us.   The service at Pizza Heaven is usually great - no long waits for food and prompt service overall. If you order to go, they will have you phone number in their system after the first order, for ease of ordering.  We haven't tried their vegan desserts yet - we never have room. Maybe on our next trip, we'll bring some home!",

I enjoyed the cozy decor with brick wall accents. Lots of vegan options and even a gluten pizza. My only disappointment was the gluten free crust.... it only comes in a 10\" size and almost too thin and crunchy around the edges. Best to eat it fresh from the oven and not reheat it later at home.",

All the places downtown seemed to be focused on traditional Italian pizza but we were craving a pie covered in meat and cheese.  After a 10 minute drive down 17th street we spotted Pizza Heaven and decided to give them a try.  It was right around 6 on a Friday and we grabbed the last 4 top.  Ordered beer and fried zucchini while we figured out which pizza to order.  Went with a deluxe minus the bell peppers, and we decided on a 12 inch, we were really trying to not have any leftovers.  It turned out to be the perfect amount for 2 adults and a 6 year old.  The pizza itself was very good, nothing skimped on, crust was not an after thought, and the pepperoni had a great kick to it.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Lighting in the dining room is dim but light was pouring in from the entryway.  Would recommend for anyone looking for traditional American pizza.  I also noticed a pretty decent sized vegan section on the menu, if you're into that.",

When we brought it to her attention she questioned what my friend ordered as if he didnt know what he ordered and then after a few minutes came back and asked us to clarify. When she brought out the correct dish she apologized saying that a lot of the menu items start with \"P\". Who would of guessed at an italian restaurant. She didn't offer to take anything off the bill and made. no effort what so ever. Don't get me wrong I love this restaurant it has amazing food and Patricia the owner is a sweetheart.

Funny story, we were there during a bad dust storm, and the power went out. The staff was incredibly accommodating (we had just gotten our food and were happy to stay and wait for the power to come back on). They made sure we had enough to drink and had enough light (candlelight), even though there was probably stuff to deal with considering the power outage.

We ordered the veggie meatball sub and the vegan cheesecake.  Delivery.  The pizza was inedible. They used so much sausage you couldn't taste anything but the sausage. It was hardly warm.  The sub was alright. Not enough sauce on it, the meatballs were dry. The fries that came with it were soggy and cold.  The vegan cheesecake was disgusting. I mean, I don't expect vegan food to be that amazing, so the bar wasn't set very high.  SOOO all in all, everything was cold and tasted gross  So I decided to call the place. I talked to the manager on duty and explained to her the situation. She told me that she couldn't do anything at the moment because she didn't have that type of authority. She told me that she would contact her boss and explain to them the situation and she would give me a call back. She gives me a call back and says \"yeah there is nothing I can do but offer you a discount on your next order because the only thing we messed up on our end were the fries\". COME ON! You had your chance. You could have remade the pizza. You could have took it off. You could have offered a gift card. You could have not been condescending. You should take pride in your food and the quality standards.  It could have been fixed in a number of ways, but this place chose not to.  I will never be back.  Also, you should have an email on your website, so customers can contact the owner or management. As an owner you should give your managers authority to make things right, but you have chose not too. If we were dining at the restaurant, we would have sent those items back. Would they have made us pay for the inedible food if we were to dine there? Would they have said \"we'll get ya next time\", instead of remaking the food so that it was at quality standard? I have no clue, but I highly doubt that I wouldn't have to give them a one star rating on yelp.",

    "text": "Went there today for the first time since living in Phx. This pizza place was the closest to my house, that was a huge plus. I went with a group of friends (total of 4) and decided to sit outside since it was overcast and nice weather. We all got appetizers and a large pizza to share.   Jalepeno poppers - were so amazing!! the cream cheese inside was melted so perfectly.  Wings - were a little vinegary for my taste but still enjoyed the mild sauce dipped in my ranch  French fries - so golden and delicious   Pizza - we created our own and added our toppings. Big slices and satisfying   We also went during happy hour so their beers special was nice and cheap   Overall, a nice little place to dine in. The prices were really affordable and the timing with the food was not questionable. We just wish they had more selections with their alcoholic drinks, but that was really no biggie",

They use a soy-based sausage that was so yummy, spiced so it wasn't bland. The boyfriend had a calzone with pepperoni and he was very happy with it. Items are a little pricey-especially the extra charges for adding extra items like veggies-and the service could have been faster but it still deserves five stars for that perfect vegan pizza.",

We then got the Vegan cheesecake for $7 a very small slice. Oh my gosh please why do they even sell this to the public. I had one bite and in that same bite I wanted to spit it out. It was extremely dry and tasted like cardboard. It was chalky if that makes sense. Please do yourself a favor and don't get this. I told the waitress that they shouldn't sell the cheesecake because it was extremely dry. She said ok I'll let her know. She said that's weird you're the first to say that. I was thinking she probably would take the slice off my receipt but she didn't.",

The total was $27. I swear, I felt my wallet twitch. The crust was crunchy, slightly dry (but that's the gluten free life). They add a lot of cheese, which I love, and there were plenty of toppings. Overall, satisfying and delicious. Just wish it was a liiiiittle cheaper.",

It was amazing the calzone omg the crust was to DIE FOR!!! Ugh I love pizza and as a vegan it's so hard to find good pizza so when I had this you know it was going down , the ranch was amazing Didn't even taste vegan , and the pasta was good too but I have to say then calzone was my fav!

This time I went in with my boyfriend on a Friday night to indulge and try out some new items. We ordered the veggie balls for an appetizer with both wing sauce and marinara, the Mediterranean pizza with soy sausage and the baked ziti.   Wow! I was really missing out by not exploring the menu. The veggie balls were huge deep fried hush puppy- like balls with whole veggies inside. The marinara was made in house but the wing sauce complimented it the best. We ordered an extra large pizza that was way too big! It had generous portions of follow your heart vegan cheese and veggies. Not bad.   My favorite though was the baked ziti. If you haven't gotten it order it now and it is the only thing you will ever want to order from there! It's served in a hot dish with large pasta noodles, chunks of melted cheese and soy sausage along with two huge servings of bread. AMAZING. My server was very helpful and there was plenty of room inside. I love how it feels like a really cozy mom and pop pizza shop. I will definitely come back for that ziti.",

Honestly, everything I've tried from the vegan menu was amazing.

This place is perfect for the whole family, Vegan or not. My husband who is not vegan enjoyed the veggie balls and even liked the vegan ranch. He also thought the pizza was good. He really enjoyed his though which was the works. It was great to see al the vegan options and even better to see that the pieces weren't ridiculously high for the vegan options. Staff was a bit slow but they were very friendly and given that there was only one guy doing it all, we understood. Restroom was clean and the overall atmosphere was nice. Not a super big place but big enough to accommodate large parties. Would definitely recommend this place if you are vegan and according to my family if your not they have great choices too.",

I chose it because my dad is an omnivore, whereas my husband and I are vegans. Everyone was happy because the menu had a lot for everyone!  We split a garden salad to start, which was plenty big for three people. The vegan ranch was excellent, and dad was satisfied with the Italian. For entrees, my husband and I shared, splitting my vegan baked ziti with soy sausage and his calzone with soy sausage and roasted red peppers. Both were delicious, but the calzone was out of the world!  The server, Lorenzo, was really nice and upbeat, and the atmosphere was great. We will definitely make this a regular spot for us!",

The pizza was very good with lots of taste and the sauce was excellent. Bread sticks were  topped with garlic butter and Parmesan cheese were very good. The right amount of garlic and so hot when they reach your table that you can not pick them up. Ordered chicken wings, the Agave barbecue were delicious and the medium hot were very good.`The salads were very good and plenty of salad for two. The Parmesan Fries were excellent cooked just right. The Insalata Caprese  could have used more Balsamic Glaze. The service was excellent with everyone caring that you had everything you needed. Will definitely go back again and recommend to everyone to try this place. You will not regret it. Our problem is that we live in Raleigh NC and as yet have not found anything quite as good as Pizza Heaven Bistro.",

With loads of Vegan options like Vegan sausage, cheese, pizza, calzones, ziti, and more, Pizza Heaven Bistro has easy access to 7th St., and ample parking. Have no fear, they also have other kinds of menu items, so non-vegans can dine with their Vegan buddies. Ambiance is meant to be old world Italian. There is a surprisingly spacious dining area, bar, and a front order and waiting area. There a paintings and murals. The place is clean, feels quaint and confortable. I ordered a Vegan Delight pizza, Crispy Tenders, and a Vegan Calzone. Each was well prepared, baked, and delicious. Another wonderful establishment with great vegan food! Cya there sometime. Postnote: the pizza is deliciously fresh and flavorful. You know a pizza is great when you put it in the fridge and then come back a couple of hours later, take a now cold slice, bite into it, and it's still light fresh tasting, and delicious!  Excellent.",

If you have time to wait for a calzone do that but be prepared to share it a big serving. The staff are friendly and helpful. They know me as the crazy meatball lady I am almost sure of it but I have always had great service and great food from this little joint in midtown Phoenix!

For me, I ordered the vegan sausage and cheese pizza; it was so horrible looking I took a picture.  I found a couple slices that looked almost baked so I ate what amounted to one slice; pretty flavorless as well.  $33 for pizza that no one liked.  Will never order again.",

I prefer to think of it as neighborhood Italian kitsch, but on a crabby day I might be less kind. The food is good, a must in any vegan's rotation. Both the pizza and subs are amazing. They use a superior vegan cheese, and I am not a fan of other fake cheese, especially on Italian cheese-centric dishes, but this stuff is amazing. My complaint is that your only side dish option for the sub is french fries - carbs with carbs; a small salad would be appreciated. Also ask for the additional veggies on the subs, they come with them but don't ask don't get. Prices are reasonable, pay at the register after the meal. Service is attentive, youthful, and helpful. Seems to be caught in between wanting to be a nice sit down restaurant and a pizza by the slice joint, but love it, even in the dark.",

    "text": "In my quest to try all the restaurants on 7th Street near my house, I decided to check out Pizza Heaven. Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.  You can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you're in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that's been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.  I first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I'm trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I've specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn't one item that they delivered that didn't look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding \"Suicide\" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.  I had actually eaten Pizza Heaven's dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  \"Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley\". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award and although I haven't tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.  For those of you who don't want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won't have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion, and I'm sure will require a larger tip.",

    "text": "Now, I can think of several places in town that serve amazing pizza - La Grande, and Pizzeria Bianco come immediately to mind.  But Pizza Heaven gets 4 stars for other reasons.  It's cheap, tasty no-frills kind of pizza , with something for everyone.    The pizza itself is thin crust with a nice crispy, yet doughy taste.  The ham, cheese (very good cheese, btw) and mushrooms I had on pizza tasted fresh and the toppings were generous.    Something that sets it apart is the wide variety of toppings and the restaurant's perceived desire to offer something for everyone.  The menu includes more than 20 veggie toppings, lowfat cheese and soy cheese upon request - something you don't find much of at a pizza joint - much less the fancy pizza palaces of Phoenix!    The decor inside is very simple - chairs and tables - no booths.  They had the basketball game on TV in the background, and even have a live band on Friday and Saturday night - not sure on the type of music.  Give them a call to find out.   They serve the normal selection of pizza, pasta, subs and salads and even have a limited offering of beer and wine for the tipplers out there...  BTW: The location is new - having relocated up the road to bigger digs (now at 5150 N 7th St. betw. Camelback and Missouri).",

The chicken alfredo pizza is amazing. It has just the right amount of everything- moist chicken, alfredo sauce, spinach, parmesan- and nothing is overwhelming or too rich.   The Queen Margherita was a hit too- basil, tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella- wow. I could have eaten the entire pie myself.   The prices are on par with what you'd expect to pay at Z Pizza, and it's worth it. The crust isn't greasy at all- it's perfect.   They have other things- sandwiches and salads, etc. but I haven't ventured beyond the pizza section of the menu yet.   They do deliver, but sadly for me I live two blocks south of the cut off point. Boo hoo.",

I used to eat at Pizza Heaven when it was further south along 7th St and always had a good meal. I called in and order for the works pizza and picked it up a short 20 minutes later, starving.  The pizza was ready when I got there and the counter girl was friendly.  These guys know how to make a pie!  Very tasty and an abundance of toppings.  Getting ready to have some for lunch!   I think my girlfriend and I will be eating there with more frequency in the future and trying some of the other menu items.  I can walk there from my house, they have live music every Friday and they serve beer and wine!  And for those who might be interested, the offer vegan cheese and gluten free crust.  Not for me though.  I want the real stuff and Pizza Heaven can definitely provide that.",

Although this is a little place, quite cramped, with loads of tables and chairs, the staff was extremely friendly and the server was sharp as a tack, and super attentive.  We had a simple pepperoni pizza and a Greek salad and we were both quite impressed. The pizza came out of the kitchen hot. The crust was thin, chewy and crispy on the edges.  I really like this place because it's a no-frills pizza place that uses fresh ingredients. I also like it because it's family-owned and operated...so tired of huge chain places, you know? I grabbed a magnet (which boasts delivery service, heck yes!) and a to-go menu on my way out the door. We'll surely be back.",

However, as I could very nearly hit it with a baseball from my condo, I had to at least give it a shot.   I was not disappointed.   The pizza, wings, pasta and sandwiches are all excellent, and every employee I have encountered has been very friendly. The restaurant has now moved up 7th street to a new location that is more representative of the quality of the food and service. A great place to grab a quick slice for lunch, or a full pie and a beer (or six) in the evenings. A flyer in the restaurant claims they have live music on the weekends, although I haven't yet witnessed this.    Overall, great quality and variety. Pepperoni, mushroom, pepperocini on wheat crust FTW!",

With it being on 7th St, the cars go by so fast, its hard for me to slow down my car to check it out. So, today I stopped on it. (Please note there is limited parking) So I walk in, pleasantly surprised to see a really nice establishment. Nice waiting area for To Go orders with 2 high top tables and a lunch counter. The menu is displayed really largely above the entrance to the dining room, so easy to read. They have take away menus to look at too. The guy at the counter was really pleasant as well. Now on to the food!  There was so much to choose from, including homemade lasagna, pizza, pasta, ravioli, sandwichs etc.  Very appealing menu options, I could hardly decide! Please note, they have gluten free and wheat options for crust and vegan and organic items too!! Great for ANYONE! I decided on the meal deal: 1 slice of pizza (1 topping), side salad, and 1 pop (or soda as AZ people say). All for $5.50 ($6.01 total) Great deal. So it only took around 5 mins and my order was ready. The pizza looked great! Not greasy and it had quality cheese and toppings and a good size slice! I got the mushroom as my topping (so good). The crust was crisp and delish. And the side salad was a nice healthy size as well. It has carrots, tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage slices on it. And the dressing, I chose was ranch. In fact, the dressing was that \"restaurant ranch\" that only True ranch dressing lovers will Truely understand. :o) Great flavor  (not a glue-type quality like some places serve)  Overall, great staff, nice setting, and good food! I will definitely not just drive by this place anymore, I will stop in more often!! :o)",

The relaxed an unpretentious atomosphere is refreshing, as most restaurants in down town Phoenix you can easily feel out of place if you walk in with jeans and a tee-shirt (in my personal opinion). I am a self proclaimed crust snob, but pizza was absolutely phenomenal...we had the Mediterranean. We also could not pass up the opportunity to try their vegan cheesecake. Made with a cashew base.. it's decadent, yet balanced, and a hint of cinnamon. Divine!!! All the while we were kept entertained by the wonderful tunes of KSM, Michael Jackson, Journey and many other classics. While all of this was wonderful in its own rite, what took the experience above and beyond was when the owner, Patricia, came over to our table and struck up conversation. What started as a simple \"how did you like the vegan cheesecake? I bake it myself!\" Led into an amazing talk about her passion for the restaurant, the food, and her community. 35+ years open, she's obviously doing something right! If only I lived closer, I would probably never leave (on second thought, it's probably better that I don't!!). This place is a gem and 100,000% worth stopping by, even if it's out of your way.",

The calzone was especially delicious and I have been thinking about it ever since. Even the spaghetti was fantastic. In fact, I'm eating it cold right now which is my inspiration for writing this review.   My husband opted to not go the vegan route and built his own pizza with double Canadian bacon, mushrooms, and some other items I don't remember, but he was extremely satisfied and had his own set of leftovers he finished today.   I will say that if you are on a diet, this is a terrible option, but if you want an incredibly delicious and hearty meal, do not skip this place; especially if you are vegan!   Ps they cater to all eating types including gluten free and vegetarian as well. They also have vegan cheesecake which I've always been too stuffed to try.",

    "text": "Great vegan options! The baked ziti with soy sausage was delicious. The focaccia with marinara sauce was scrumptious. The Mediterranean pizza was yummy too. They use Follow Your Heart cheese which makes all of the difference. This will be our new go to Italian place since we have a vegan, vegetarian and carnivore, all of whom have many delicious options.  The service was not quite up to par though. The server couldn't answer fairly simple questions about the menu and we waited a long time to order, then for the food to arrive and then for the check. It was frustrating but the food was so yummy it made the poor service easier to cope with.",

I am not a vegetarian but I have dabbled in a few of Pizza Heaven's vegan items and I must say that they are pretty delicious. Another great food item at this place is their wings and breadsticks are incredible. When it comes to lunch the meal deals are affordable and filling. Not to mention the portions are Pizza Heaven are amazing. You definitely get more than what you pay for! Also the wait is never too long and the service is always friendly.

Drinks were out about 5 minutes later ... When asking for tea ... Advised it had to brew ... And NEVER received it ... however by the time we were done eating ... Was advised the tea was ready and would be right out ... Why bother by then ? Almost an hour later ...   Food came out at different times and in an erratic order ... Ordered a salad with a calzone ... 2 companions did the special of a slice of pizza and wings each ... And the 4th did the 2 slice special ... And breadsticks ...   The salad came out ... Then about 10 minutes later the wings for one person came out ... And about 5 minutes after that the 2 slice special came out ... With the slice a pizza for the other person who ordered the pizza and wings ... Another 10 min go by and the wings finally come out for the other person ... And about 10 minutes or so more after that the other slice of pizza finally showed up with the calzone ...  By this time the drinks were empty and asked for refills ... NEVER GOT THEM !!! And the breadsticks ordered ... Never got them ...   When a complaint was made to the manager ... He made the excuse that the servers were busy with helping to answer the phone as well as helping other tables ... which there were a total of 4 in all ... and 2 of the tables had a different server ... She was polite to the customers she had and apologizes when it did take her a few extra minutes due to having to answer the phone, etc. ... But she did bring refills to them when asked and she did check on to make sure everything was ok ...   The manager did not want to take responsibility for the lack of service provided by our waiter ... And didnt even seem to be phased when advised the table behind us was complaining about the lack of service as well ... All this time ... The waiter was standing at the cash register doing nothing ... And then we had to even ASK for the check to be brought out since he was just standing ... Doing nothing ...   Upon leaving ... The manager did provide a discount ... However he still did not want to take responsibility for his waiter who was doing such a crappy job ...   All in all ... Food was awesome ... Would definitely eat it again ... But if we do ... It will be for pick up so we never have to worry about such horrible service again ... Or the wrist slitting music playing ...",

One of which was missing and didn't make it to the table for at least 10 minutes. I had to track down oir waitress to get an update on the food and to ask for more water. Finally we received all of our food and asked for the check only to be given another tables check. When I walked to the front desk to get the check it had no discount and there was no apology for the terrible service. It was almost like they hoped that we would just accept crappy service since the server was new. I mentioned the awful service and all that they offered to do was take half off of the entree that took forever to make it to the table. The food and service are normally good, but tonights fiasco has turned me off of this restaurant for a long time if not forever.",

He knows I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food. It's a little small place. However, excellent service. Our waitress was very good. Our Groupon was $40.00 worth of food. The food was out of this world. We had mozzarella sticks,the meat lovers pizza, and 2 pasta dishes . Very reasonable pricing. Owner is very well mannered and came over to us. Honestly I typically don't go to a resturant twice unless I really like it. This is going to be my regular Italian place. Make no mistakes about that.",

We also ordered wings, half medium and half honey hot BBQ, both were HOT!!   They don't have milk for kids, if you have kids you know that this is important. They don't have draft beer but they said they were working on getting some.   I would visit this place again.",

I absolutely loved the spaghetti. Perfect pasta, a nice simple delicious marinara. The meatballs were done perfectly. They were juicy, tender, seasoned perfectly, and the star of my meal. I will definitely order again and again.",

It was ok, but maybe better with thin crust? All in all a decent little pizza place, but hard to compete with the likes of Pomo and some other pizza options downtown.",

This is because of my preference for plant based foods and not many places create a suitable pizza, and those that do use Daiya, which I find disgusting! Well, Pizza Heaven uses Vegan Gourmet. On pizza I don't even know if omnivores could tell the difference!  My son ordered a pepperoni pizza off of the \"regular\" menu said it was good too. Our 2nd time there we shared a vegan pineapple pizza (light on the \"cheese\") and we both enjoyed it, just wish there was even more pineapple on it.  Pizza Heaven has a separate Vegan menu offering which earns tons of bonus points in my book!  The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is clean!",

It ain't a hippie joint so meat eaters won't care. It could get a 5 star if the beer tap was colder and had a few more options. Think traditional Italian place that for some reason has awesome vegan pizza.",

We split a calzone with pepperoni and basil, a side of meatballs, and an order of garlic bread. Total? 18$...whaaaat?!?! Awesome! and it was a ton of food too. The meatballs were really good, soft, but not too soft, and flavorful. The garlic bread was nothing too special, but it was standard. The calzone was very good. They loaded this thing with basil, it wasn't like a little bit here and there, so I appreciated that. Additionally, it had a lot of pepperoni...too much for me, but the husband loved that. They top the calzone with garlic and bake until it's golden brown.... this thing was so delicious and large, we certainly had leftovers. I also found out that this place will deliver all the way out to my house at 15th ave and mcdowell....awesome! This may be my new go to pizza.   PS this place is very accommodating, they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!",

Sean was always around, refilling our cups, getting us ranch, asking us if we needed anything. Got the angel bites with hot chocolate= HOLY MOTHER OF GOD. They were warm and tasty and the hot chocolate was good. I just can't. Go but tell no one else. This is fight club.",

The pasta was very good and the potion was decent. The restaurant is small and the lights are dimmed giving it a romantic feel. I enjoyed my visit and am glad we spotted this Pizza Heaven Bistro.

Our server, Renee was quick and attentive to our thirsty ice tea needs :p always having a smile asking if all is ok. Now the food? The wings were super crispy like we requested and just enough sauce to keep them that way. Got the Caesar salad and focaccia bread w/ mozz. Nothing Stand out but still good. We had the Bianco pizza with pepperoni (and ricotta that is request only) and was some of the best pizza I've had in a while. Not too thick or thin. Cooked just right  def going to be coming here instead of Humble pie from now on. Knowing it's family owned is also a great deli point as well. Full support!",

I have heard good things about it so I figured I would give it a try. I ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza and 10 hot wings to go. When I got to my car I took a couple bites of the pizza and was pretty disappointed. It had very little flavor, and the crust was to crispy with very little flavor.      After I got home I ate a couple more slices and ended up throwing the rest away. I then tried the wings. Disappointed again!! Extremely strong pepper flavor and very little sauce. It tasted like pepper flavored backed chicken.     The worst part about this was, this was a splurge for. I haven't been off my diet in a very long time. I guess I won't be going back to pizza heaven.",

He made sure my dietary restrictions were met and confirmed each item was vegan. I will be returning!",

We LOVE restaurants that not only serve, but actually make plant based options from scratch- just like Pizza Heaven! Their homemade veggie balls are to DIE for! We dream of the mouth watering Vegan baked ziti and they have vegan cheese and make the most amazing pizza! We also love the friendly service and Lorenzo is our favorite server- he always greets us with a smile and calls me sweetie- always a nice touch for a 40 year old woman! Thanks Pizza Heaven and staff for giving us a reliable place to always fill our hungry Vegan tummies!",

I called in my order and the lady who answered was a bit rude. My food was supposed to be ready in about a 1/2 hr but that was not the case. One of the guys gave me and my brother-in-law a piece of pizza to sample since we were waiting so long. Apparently there was some confusion about my order being pick up or delivery. An hr after I called in the order, my food magically appeared. It was sitting on top of the oven. I was angry. But when I bit into the vegan delight, all my anger subsided. The BEST vegan sausage and vegan cheese I have ever tasted.   My husband and I fell in love w the vegan menu and I'm embarrassed to say we went there 4xs in one week. It is that good!!! We picked up the same pizza 2 nights later and then dined in and our waiter was phenomenal. Not like the lady who answers the phones. The vegan starter w veggies and bread was so Delish. I think it was called the Mediterranean Medley. The next time my husband picked up vegan sandwiches and the veggie ball sandwich was out of this world!!! Food is fantastic!!!! Now if they could just give the phone answerer an attitude adjustment, this place would be perfect!!!",

When it arrived it was lukewarm and very dry. It took forever to receive and pay our check and it seemed all of the servers were clustered around the cashier area in mass confusion.  Our water was never refilled and I had to go up and ask for refills for beer and wine. Overall a real disappointment.

Had to be the of the best vegan pizza's I've ever had.  From the moment the cashier placed my food in my hands I knew it would be good.  Just the smell of it alone had my mouth watering. I had intended on taking it home but I had no patience. The smells kept poking me in my shoulder saying eat me,  eat me,  eat me NOW!!! So I did.   I sat in my car and at all 6 veggie balls with my fingers with no utensils or napkins.  I can say they were finger kicking good,  but I would have preferred a fork.  But no biggie,  they were thoroughly enjoyed.  I then proceeded to attempt my 18 min ride home with the pizza riding in the passengers side staring at me but I broke down and had a slice on the way home.  I just couldn't resist.  As soon as I got home I ate 4 more slices.  I'm stuffed and am a happy camper. But I will have my running shoes on in the morning.   Would highly suggest to amy vegan/non vegan customer.  Customer service was cool too. I'd put bible scriptures on the boxes too. Heavenly idea .",

Love the lasagna, whether Bolognese or spinach, chicken or beef (I'm not much on sausage with flavored with anisette  - always hated licorice!), and can speak just as positively of the baked ziti with ricotta and marinara, perfectly spiced Cajun chicken Alfredo, and fettuccine  Alfredo with a perfect, not excessively rich creamy sauce, all currently $8-$9.  I've never even tried the pizzas but my friends have and seem to enjoy them all - and I can attest they look and smell great - and as I'm so hungry right now it's going to be tough to not re-route my trip home for one of those tonight.   Sub sandwiches at $7 or $8 also a pleasure. The ones I've tried include the Meatball Parmigiano, the Heaven's Ham, and I think the Italian Stuffer, well-filled with salami, pepperoni, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato and mayo.  A bonus for the gluten impaired, brown rice pasta available as a substitute on most pasta dishes, at no discernible loss of taste or texture.   Service is always friendly if not exactly spot-on.  The young wait staff may not ask if you want wine, dessert, or a refill on your tea or soft drink, but it otherwise so affable and everything so affordable, you can overlook it - and just look forward to that cheesecake or tiramisu on a return visit.   Very good food. Very affordable priced.",

It was a cool little hole in the wall back then. Now it is more like a cool little family restaurant.  They play live music even on certain days. THe food is good, the atmosphere is not too bad.It is a nice place to go and not too bad on the wallet. On a busy day or night parking can be tight. But,  other wise it is great. Check it out one day when you are on the East side of pghoenix. You just might like it.",

    "text": "We like this place because it is right down the road from our apartment and works well as a meeting place for friends.  The best part is they have both Vegan and Gluten Free options.  This makes it great for when we want to gather with our closest friends who run fall all over the food spectrum.    The pizza is good.  I'm from Chicago so I'm picky about my pizza as nothing is ever as good as my home town staple.  But I enjoy this place.  The crust is good, not too dry and airy.  The only thing I don't like is that their thin crust is not a True thin crust in my eyes.  I like crispy thin crust but it is still a good crust.  The pizza was not oily or greasy at all.  We've had pepperoni,  sausage, and ham and pineapple on our pizza.  My boyfriend has had the wings and they smelled good to me and appeared to taste good as he polished them off.  We've had their pizza dine in and carry out and really have no complaints.  My only other dislike is that the pizza is not as good the next morning.  Yes I judge pizza based on it's taste as cold leftovers.  But, I love cold pizza so this is a huge scoring point for me.  It's a great little neighborhood spot that we will continue to visit.",

We got the caprese salad, hot agave BBQ wings, I got the calzone (with sausage and bacon) and my girlfriend got the chipotle chicken pasta. It was literally the best Italian food I've ever had. I feel so strongly that I am sitting in the parking lot writing this review right now. We met the owner, Patricia, who was a delight and our server Lorenzo was very cool as well and had some great suggestions. We will definitely be returning. Do not pass this place up. The atmosphere, food, and service are all top notch. Side note, there's an Oregano's down the street but this place is far superior. Far. Superior. Do not sleep on this place. Spend your money here on better Italian food in greater quantities. Thank you Pizza Heaven Bistro!",

I think one of the hardest things about not being able to eat dairy is not being able to eat pizza, so this place is a dream come True for anyone who is dairy-free.  The style of the cheese (melts well), the thickness of the crust (tastes very similar to many East Coast pizzerias), and the subtle taste of sausage (it's made with fennel to give it taste without tasting too meaty) make this piece of pizza a serious slice of heaven.    They have gluten-free pizza and the crust is from a local bakery.  If you happen to have a problem, talk to the owner.  She's very receptive.  Also, she's appreciative of inputs from vegans.    Yum, yum, yum.  Go here.",

The fries looked like they were handmade and very salty which I enjoyed. I rated this place a 4 but would have probably given them a five if:  1 - The food didn't take so long. There was no one in front of me and it took 19 minutes.  2 - If they actually got my order right. Note that I am reviewing the meatball sub, however I ordered the chicken parmesan sub which it clearly read on my receipt. When the kid brought the food to my table I noticed he picked up the receipt, noted the mistake, got nervous and crumpled it up. I would have sent it back but I had limited time on my lunch hour.   Overall I would go back but would allot more time in the event of a mistake.",

We ordered a little bit of everything, the caprese salad was good, I liked that you could poor your own amount of balsamic on it...the wings were just ok, pretty messy and our server did not leave us with any extra napkins and I had to eat HOT wings without a drink...I had an empty beer glass and was never offered water. I noticed waters on all of the other tables though. The owner looked at our table several times so I thought she noticed but nothing was done. The pizza was good, but need a little more sauce(i'm a sauce fan). We also tried the sausage lasagna and thought it was delicious.  We will probably go back again for a nice relaxing dinner but only order a pizza or pasta dish. I would recommend making reservations on a Friday night as after we were seated, the place got very busy.   Overall it's a nice place and worth a try if you've never been or if you are on a vegan/vegetarian diet.",
