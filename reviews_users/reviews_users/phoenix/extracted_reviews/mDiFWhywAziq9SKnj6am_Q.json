It took 1 hour to get our appetizer s, then another 20 minutes to get our entrees.  Extremely slooooooooo service.  We were all dying of hunger until the apps came.  Maybe they just had a bad night,  but we will not return.",

Ziggy, the owner, and chef, came to greet us and check on us. When I asked about a specific Italian dish, (which is a challenge to make) he said if I gave him lead time of a day  he would work to make it happen.   Love that!!! Great experience!",

The Lounge has been transformed into a hip \"must go venue\" with acts Tuesday through Saturdays from Standup Comedy, live guitar and jazz. So great to have this in \"the slope.\" Businesses like this are going to drive up this neighborhood. Well done Ziggy ... and thank you.",

I have had their gnocchi, eggplant rollatini, pasta with sausage, etc. and all has been good. Sitting inside is a very different experience than sitting outside; tonight there was no outside seating so we were forced indoors and the experience was not as good. I highly suggest outdoors if possible. The servers are usually young kids who don't have much experience, so don't expect a lot in that department. But the food is great, as is the ambiance.",

    "text": "Il Posto is very close to my house, so I'd been jonesing to try it again. I had been here years ago when it was known as Our Gang, and I was as impressed with the actual restaurant now as I was then: it is big, but has lots of nooks and crannies and a cool outdoor area with a fire pit and outdoor bar, it's pretty nifty for Phoenix. They've made it feel very Scottsdale with the new decor inside. I can take that or leave it. The food is what matters, and the food was good, but not great. I can't remember how good it was back in the Our Gang days, that was like nine years ago, but the food now is hit and miss. It is definitely more hit than miss.   The meal starts with a complimentary basket of bread with a garlic/parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is just plain FABULOUS. We had the crab cakes appetizer. The flavor was absolutely delicious and the remoulade it came with was decadent, but the cakes were ruined by being ridiculously mushy. I had the seafood manicotti (see my uploaded picture) which we both agreed was blameless and wonderful. My wife had the veal parmesan which we both found bland and somewhat overcooked, with too much breading. It came with an abundance of pasta on the side, soaked in a sauce that was a lot like thickened tomato soup. I like tomato soup, she doesn't. It was pretty unforgivably mediocre.   All in all, we didn't feel like our experience was worth sixty bucks, but we think we might feel different if we came back and ordered more judiciously.",

The decor outside is great, one wall has doors, windows, and a balcony to make it look more like new York. There is also a big statue of liberty replica. The server greeted us quickly and brought waters right away. She was knowledgeable on the drink and food menu.  The music on the patio was modern acoustical hits, and we found it to be very enjoyable.  They have a nice selection of beer and wine so I decided to go with the craft beer out of San Diego called Sculpin IPA. We decided to start off with calamari and the breaded mozzarella.  The apps came out very quickly. The calamari was cooked perfectly and the marinara dipping sauce was so delicious.  The mozzarella was equally perfect on a bed of marinara with fresh basil on top. For the entree, I ordered rigatoni bolognese which was delicious.  I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back soon.  FYI, they have an adjoining lounge called The Lounge which has a wonderful selection of signature mixed drinks and after dinner cocktails.  We decided to pop in after dinner where I enjoyed a Moscow mule serve in the copper cup, we had a great evening thanks to I'll Post and the lounge!",

As part of a large group of about 20, I was concerned there would be too much confusion over drinks and food orders. Such was not the case. Our servers were prompt and attentive and were able to remember our names. Amazing! The bread and pesto they start you with is great. Even better was the insane amount of garlic they use. The bruscetta was wonderful. The NY Spinach White Pizza was out of this world!!   Our one friend is moving out of this area of town, but we'll be back for Il Posto.",

    "text": "I went to Il Posto last night because I wanted to eat there one more time before I wrote my review. I go there for lunch with the work bunch on occasion. They have a popular lunch special with pizza and salad ($7), but I especially like the goat cheese sandwich. It's a flavored pita folded over marinated veggies and loads (I mean LOADS) of goat cheese! It's called a panini, I think, which threw me the first time because a hot pressed sandwich comes to mind when I hear the word but this one is not hot. Let me tell you: that is NO REASON to skip the burst of flavors this provides!  A few weeks ago, I was there to grab a quick drink with a friend. We sat out on the cute patio that is set up to look like a street in Little Italy, U.S.A. These people can pour a drink! I already had a dinner commitment, so I just noshed on the bread and pesto that was provided. The pesto was loaded with parmesan... soo delish! And, the warm bread was better than any I've found in Arizona so far!  Last night, I had a crab cake appetizer as my entree. I got three for $11. Not much filler, but lots of diced veggies like onion, peppers mixed with the crab. I was full by the time I finished and could not have taken another bite! All together, I had two (generous) vodka sodas and the crab cakes (plus more bread and pesto, of course!) for just under $30.  I hear from a lot of people in the neighborhood how they miss Our Gang (what this place used to be called) and they lament the old meat sauce or some other menu item that got dropped when they changed the name. Last night, I found out the meat sauce is back! And, Matt, the manager has been very accommodating and open to suggestions every time I've had a minute to pester him about what's going on with the Lounge (the '60 era-Sinatra style venue they plan to open next door).  So, now I have my eye on the white pizza and can't wait to go back!",

The patio is still a nice place to dine and our waitress was very attentive and sweet, but the dishes we ordered were bleah. Its a bummer because they were things we had eaten here before and were favorites.   We had the calamari appetizer and it was a smaller portion, better for 1 person, served on a too big mound of romaine. Was too rubbery.  My wife had the chicken parmigiana and they put waaay too much sauce on it. The breading was ruined by that and just sloughed off. The sauce was bland.  I had the mussells marinara with an ok caesar salad. The marinara was a very tasty wine sauce. I ate about 8 mussells then bit into a bad one. Had to spit it out since it was rancid. Was on a date night with my wife with the kids at home which is rare, so i decided to try and power through it without sending it back and wrecking the flow. I ate 2 more mussells and then hit another bomb. I had to tap out and call it a wrap at that point.  Hopefully they get new cooks back there or new kitchen management, or the existing ones  can get their sh*t together.",

    "text": "The only problem I had was with my charge card which is a Big deal!  I've only been there about 4-5 times & the last 2 times I've ordered  the eggplant parm which I love since I'm a vegetarian.  The service is horrendous!  Our waitress was ditsy & couldn't get everyones order straight.   She did get help much later... which was a tad better.  I met friends there & we each had separate orders but 3 of the receipts were with my bill.  Then to top that off,  a day later I noticed she charged me again on my statement  for someone else's order.  THAT shouldn't happen!  That's the 1st time that has happened to me.  You shouldn't play with people's money!!!  It eventually was taken care of but shouldn't have to go thru that!  Now I know NOT to eat there being afraid it would happen again....  I don't want to take the time & energy to fix it again.  And the manager doesn't get back to you like he says he'll do...  I waited 1 1/2 hrs.  for his call.   Ziggy has to hire more experienced wait staff sorry to say, as I've read on previous reviews. Slow service!  But the food was above 2 stars...",

Owner came round and asked how our meal was which is a nice tough. Had the same server on both our visits there now and he is very friendly and helpful.   Great that they own the lounge next door which is a great spot to have a quite drink whilst listening to some chilled music. Bar man Chris is more than willing to make any drink you want even if not on menu, which they are changing as they are new owners.  Looking forward to seeing what they do to drinks menu in the lounge previous owners had some strange drinks. Mojhito is a definite with summer coming.",

Things we did to try to get service....put our menus down, smiled at the waitress, watched them walk by. The waitresses even chatted for a bit at their station. WTF?

The weather was beautiful so we asked to be out on the patio that had a few empty tables. Service was terrible. We didn't get to finally order an appetizer until over half an hour of sitting at our table, which we decided to order our food at the same time to save our server another trip. While sitting with empty drinks for 1.5 hours and a different server attending us because she noticed our anxiousness, we finally got our plates. Still no appetizer or refills. Our original server then came up to us and assured us our appetizer was still on its way and she ensured they were making it fresh. We had ordered mozzarella sticks. When we got them the cheese had hardened on the outside and they were hardly warm. Disappointment is an understatement. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "This review could have gone a very different way this evening....  We live in the area and love supporting local restaurants. Better food, unique experiences. We tried out Ziggy's for the first time tonight.  My review tonight may have ended with a 1 star review. The service was very poor. Perhaps a new waitress. Perhaps a little understaffed. But regardless, it was poor. We placed our order. Appetizer came out a tad slow, but not noteworthy. Bruschetta. Very good. Crisp, fresh crostini with a tomato/basil/Parmesan topping that obviously was made with a lot of love and care.   However, our entrees took forever. Almost 45 minutes after ordering, I approached the counter where I could see that \"Ziggy\" himself was running the pizza oven. I commented to him as constructively as I could that we had been waiting a long time and that nobody was really taking care of us. He apologized sincerely. I realized at this moment that our pizzas had not even been made yet or placed in the oven. He assured me that I would be next up.  Now, the pizza itself was extremely good. Perfect chewy crust with a crisp slightly burnt exterior. Not sure if they pull their own mozzarella or not, but it tasted extremely fresh. However, no pizza is worth waiting nearly an hour to receive during a dine in visit. This review gets 5 stars because of how the chef treated us. He made the bill right with us (least of my concern), came and set with us several times to discuss our satisfaction and the struggle of the evening in the restaurant. He was pleasant, didn't react negatively to the experience and stressed the importance that repeat customers are his priority in running the joint.   The food itself deserved 5 stars and while the service itself started out miserable, the chef/owner really saved the day and assured we will come back and give the service a second try. The food and care by the owner earned them as much!",

    "text": "After having a great experience here for our company Christmas party last December my husband and I along with my best friend returned here tonight for our anniversary dinner. To say we were disappointed is an understatement! It took 5 min just standing there to be seated, plenty of open tables just no one came to seat us. Another 20 min before anyone came to get our drink order. We ordered our dinners at the same time. 15 min to get a soda and 2 scotch on the rocks. another 30 min to get a warm pizza, not hot out of the oven, 10 more min to get the 2nd meal and 10 more min to get my lasagna, also warm not hot, after she brought me the wrong order. The lasagna was no where near as good as it was when I ordered it at our party in December. The server ignored our attempt to flag her down and I ended up asking a busboy to get me another soda, then our server came flying over to the table. 10 more minutes for another scotch, and she NEVER came to ask if our food was OK or if we needed more drinks or wanted desert. The restaurant was busy but not that busy, now we know why. When we finally received our checks and she took them to run the credit cards it was another 10 min before the busboy brought them back to us. Our server couldn't even do it herself. The 3 of us agree this was the absolute WORST SERVICE we have ever received anywhere. Needless to say her tips were practically non-existent. I will no longer recommend this place to anyone. I wonder if the 5 star reviewers were compensated for writing them.",

There were eight of us and I did not hear why it was so slow. It didn't seem that busy.      Now with the negative out of the way so many Great things. Ed, manager was wonderful, our server short haired female girl wonderful very very good server!! I loved it I had gluten-free pizza it had good cheese fresh basil big mushrooms and sausage. They start you with bread it was amazing and warm great pesto butter. We had everything from Caesar salad to basic spaghetti and meatballs and piccata chicken with an amazing sauce.      I really enjoyed the atmosphere it had low lighting good combination of decor and different entertainment each night they had an outdoor court and beautiful seating outside.      They had a great variety of wines in a good bar it was a great celebration place for our October birthdays!",

We explained that we had not been there previously and we were just checking it out. She was very friendly and said \"come on, I'll give you the nickel tour!\" The first stop was the pizzeria section with an open area kitchen. Next came the outdoor seating area which was very quaint and had a wonderful ambience. Beyond that was The Grotto which was quaint as well and had outdoor seating with a fireplace where you can smoke or vape. We ordered a white pizza which was unbelievably delicious! My Appletini was just perfect as was my friends gin and tonic. For dessert we had amazing calzones that were perfect. They have live entertainment every night of the week with Sunday being an open mic night. Overall it was a great experience and we will definitely be back!",

First, shouldn't take 10+ minutes to get a bottle of beer. Second, the waiting period to get our food was close to an hour and to top it off, they forgot the kids pizza.  That took an extra 20 minutes.  They are more focused on getting the uber meals out than the people in their restaurant. Server kept apologizing for the wait but didn't even comp the kid's pizza.  I didn't even see a manager on duty or at least one that resembled a manager to express our concerns but I'm sure they knew since the whole restaurant was complaining to their servers.  At one point we noticed no one had a plate in front of them except 1 side salad.   My frustration tonight wanted to give 1 star but their food was really good.  I hope they can improve on their service so I can give a better review next time.",

The outside patio is cozy especially when the fire is burning and the weather is chilly, combine that with a nice bottle of red wine and it creates a warm and comfortable ambience.   Last Friday's dinner the atmosphere was just right, the sounds of cutlery, dinner chatter and my husband and I were gearing up to enjoy our favorite, the seafood house special and meat lasagna-until we learned the restaurant had been sold. Our experience with our server Devon was hands down the best yet we were leery of the change. As patrons we questioned the intentions of the new owner and we were doubtful, but by the end of the evening we had a change of heart.   The new restaurant owner, Executive Chef 'Ziggy' was wearing a maroon colored, double-breasted culinary jacket, he appeared fresh-faced and excited and his energy exuded charisma. I watched him crank up the fire pit to enhance our dinner experience and to our delight he suggested background music which we definitely agreed. He also expressed fresh ideas yet maintain the winning menu with a few tweaks here and there and even attested to staying faithful to the True character of \"her\" meaning the restaurant, as he looked around at his new haven.   Immediately, we took a liking to him especially as we watched him in action with the guests. He was courteous and welcoming from young to old, he demonstrated genuine appreciation for the patrons and reminded folks to sit down and relax. After all, that's why we come out to dinner right?  Needless to say, we enjoyed our experience that night and felt the future of Il Posto will not only continue to thrive but exceed success. We are excited and ready for the fresh energy and the few new faces, yet experience the same great Italian food on planet earth. This is a must try-period.",

I have taken different friends there, dates there before I met my husband, and no matter who I have gone with,have always had a pretty positive experience.  That said, last night I went there with my husband, immediate family, and best friend to celebrate my birthday. There were 6 of us. This time I ordered a simple spaghetti & meatballs.  I was surprised that I did not really like it.  I gave 1/2 the meal to my brother to eat after and 1 of the 2 meatballs to my dad.  I was also really surprised at the response we received when we asked for more bread.  We had eaten 2 small baskets each with a single little loaf of sliced bread, and when we asked if we could have more, the server said, \"I'm not sure. How many have you had?\" I thoughts he was kidding. But we were told we could have 1 more loaf of bread but after that we'd be charged $2.50 for each additional loaf.  What a crappy policy.  I guess everyone else liked their food ok so I gave them 3 stars. Also my husband. Enjoyed a bottle of wine for a great deal because it was a Weds. special they always run.",

When I served, I would have rolled my eyes and been short as hell with the ONLY customers on the patio, but she was gracious, outgoing and friendly the entire visit!

They have a fantastic patio, inside seating in the restaurant and a lounge where you can also order their full menu.  They continually bring in fun local talent and are definitely becoming a neighborhood hotspot as well as the Italian restaurant of choice for travelers.  In addition to fantastic food, you won't find a place with a friendlier staff or better service anywhere.

My husband ordered the special, shrimp scampi on linguini with mussels.  He loved it!  Our waiter, D.  was helpful and attentive.

It's authentic Italian food! The servings are on the larger side so this makes the family sharing and trying is a fun touch! They even have gluten free options. When Arizona has nice weather the patio is so charming, cute little courtyard, fire pit. The servers are always sweet and great service. If you are looking for a place this is it! Soooooo yummy",

A tablet that came in after us received the appetizer we had ordered an hour ago.  I had to request our good be served. Then the food came and it was poor. The mussels were the smallest I had ever seen. Main dishes mostly melted cheese. The table next to us had to ask where their wine order was. It final came and a bug was in one of the glasses.

Grilled shrimp over pasta was good not great. Little did we know that at 8 a live combo starts playing. It was mo town night. So much fun. A lively if older crowd. Headed back on a Saturday for Jazz.

Pizza was incorrect, missing pepperoni on half of it.  We'd each taken a slice when we noticed it.  They took it back, put pepperoni on the other side, threw it back in the oven and brought it back to the table; the same pizza, 2 pieces missing and over cooked.  Who would do that?  A decent place would have replaced the pizza with the correct order.  Then, we were charged a 2 x $2 'entertainment fee'.  What?  No disclosure of this fee and I wonder if (and sincerely doubt that) it is applied equally.  Not like a door charge where you know everyone gets dinged.    Service seemed ok until after we pointed out the messed up pizza, then became a bit icy.  Probably why we got charged the 'fee'.  And a month or so ago, ordered some manicotti to go (usually awesome) but the pasta itself was hard (didn't seem over cooked, just weird pasta).  I won't be going back.  There are too many other places in town that know how to deal with their own screw-ups decently.  Re-fired pizza!  What a joke!  How small-minded.",

We were seated quickly and greeted by a friendly server. She brought us delicious bread and pesto dipping sauce and I was anticipating a great dinner. Then the \"dinner\" arrived. The spaghetti I ordered was hard, undercooked, and bland. The (2) meatballs had a soggy texture and were completely flavorless. I sampled the fettuccine Alfredo and was again disappointed by the bland noodles and flavorless sauce. My daughter who usually voraciously devours all noodles refused to finish the Alfredo. My wife ordered the eggplant Parmesan and was also disappointed. Considering the price of these items, my whole family was thoroughly disappointed. Our attentive server was the only bright spot of the night. Our disappointment was wholly with the food itself.",

The service is average and for a small place, that is sad. The decor is quite lovely and they have a beautiful patio. The food is pretty good. Although the specials seem to be the same both times we went. So obviously the chef doesn't much do local and variety. Prices aren't bad. Here's my two biggest complaints- 1. classic rock Really? 2.TV with football on. Are you trying to be a neighborhood pub (which is strange since I understand they own the Lounge next door) or a quaint neighborhood, indie restaurant? Either is cool, but pick one and do it well. My suggestion is go for the later since you have all the makings and so few of those up there in Sunnyslope. If you want good food with friends and family, this is your place. A romantic evening, chose elsewhere.",

Clearly whoever owns it has thought about the decor, the outdoor patio is very cool. On friday evening we had the large booth on the right as you walk in, my guess is no one has cleaned the table with anything other than a damp rag for months, i bought this to the attention of the server and guess what a quick wipe over witha wet rag. The table had so much grime on it when i passed my cc over it, it bought up a large film of who knows what, that really set us off in the wrong direction. I dont get why the simple things like tables being clean get overlooked. We have come to expect the food to be a bit hit and miss, the bread and olive oil with pesto is great. I ordered pasta it was ok not great but prices are very reasonable, we sent one of the salads back ...... Sadly i think we will not return, big shame its close to our home and someone clearly cared enough at some point to create a great environment but food quality and cleanliness are really wanting.",

    "text": "I first tried out this place with my boyfriend, and shared a pizza and salad. Our waitress was super sweet, and the food was pretty good. Having this experience, I decided I would have a group dinner here, to celebrate my friend's birthday. 20 people confirmed, so I decided to call to make a reservation. Not only was I given the run around as to whether they actually accepted reservations, but the hostess on the phone was extremely snotty. I ended up having to call the place 3 times, to ensure my tables would be held. We were assigned one waitress to our table, who acted annoyed the entire time. Our entire party was drinking too, so I was not sure why the attitude. Don't servers want their tables  to rack up a bill?? Aside from the service, everything else was great. I just wish our business had been appreciated more. Maybe next time we will stick to a restaurant chain who knows how to handle large parties, and appreciate people who spend money with them.",

    "text": "My husband and I went there on 10/26/10 to eat. We have been going here about every other month for years (back when it used to be Our Gang Cafe and now is Il Posto) and have always enjoyed the food and the service up until tonight. We have even brought others with us on occasion. I had originally called to make sure they were open and the person that answered the phone just said \"hi\". She did not identify the place so I had to ask is this \"Il Posto\" and got silence. I asked again and she said yes and gave me their hours of operation. Then when we got there we asked to be seated at a booth inside. (Did not want to take the chance that there were smokers on the patio.) The first booth was right behind the hostess station and on the other side was a prep station with plates and misc items that looked like the busboys used to set up the tables. The noise from the clanking of items was too loud so I asked for another booth. The next booth we sat down at the table was dirty although there were fresh settings. So we got up and went to a third booth. There were several large crumbs of food items on the seats and the table had a greasy sheen to it. There was a busboy (waiter?) nearby so we asked if he could clean the table again. He came to the table and took the seat cushion and upended it and flipped it over and slammed it down loudly and gave us a look like we were bothering him. We also told him the table was greasy, so he grabbed a cloth in a huffy way and pushed the cloth around on one small spot in a circle near the end of the table and then threw the cloth on his station. So I went over to the hostess and started telling her what had happened and then stopped and asked for the manager. I was told the manager was busy. I told her I couldn't believe the awful treatment we were getting. A gentlemen with a long apron came up and tried to help us but all he really did was give us lip service. His attitude was not one of someone who cared if a customer had a good experience. He pointed out a table instead of a booth and we pointed out to him that the table also had a greasy sheen to it so he ran his hand over it and saw that his fingers left a trail on the table like ours did on the other tables. We just decided to leave because it seemed that no one there cared about us having a quiet and enjoyable meal. This just is not acceptable and I'm sad to say I will most likely never eat here again and I will tell everyone I know about how badly we were treated.",

    "text": "This place has been around for a while-had a different name-remodeled and I could probably count the number of times that I have been here on one hand. I have some mixed reviews on this place. The stars keep falling as I keep going back there though.   First couple of visits were pretty good-yummy foods, good portions, tasty drinks on their beautiful ambiance of a patio.   Had a big birthday party on their patio back in April-it was very delightful and the waiters were pretty attentive to our large party(20+people)-they just keep bringing more and more bottles of wine-great time, but I was a little afraid of what the bill was going to look like since they weren't even asking anyone if we wanted more wine bottles opened.   I have enjoyed a nice satisfying meal in a booth with a friendly waitress on another occasion.   This past weekend I arrived on a Saturday evening at 6:15 with 4 other party members. We generously accepted red wine when we sat down, but had to wait over 45 minutes to get our starter dinner salads. One of my friends ordered a vodka cranberry and 2 of us tasted it and it tasted pretty \"nonalcoholic\" so we had to send it back to \"The Lounge.\" I felt like we were just filling up on their complimentary bread a pesto the whole time while waiting forever for our food to get to our table. The pizza selection was interesting-I think I could only find one with red sauce and the waitress was surprised to find the same results on the menu when we double checked. For dinner I shared a small pizza, and it didn't come out looking like what the description had said and I looked over at another friend and her husband's \"split\" dish dinner-it consisted of 2 ravioli's on one plate and 3 on the other-I felt so bad for them that I offered to share some of my share of pizza to them and they accepted with more satisfied bellies in the end. I don't know if the kitchen was backed up or what not, but I have recently heard from friends that it has not been a great experience at this restaurant for them either.   All in all the food and wine is good, but don't expect quick service or larger portions these days. I'm not sure you'll be getting what you're paying for, but hey I can't complain on the price too much since I used a QUICK TIP: RESTURANT.COM coupon on the last evening I spent there!",

I was hoping for something resembling huevos rancheros but was left with dry scrambled eggs on dry tortillas. the cheese was mildly flavored and the salsa did have a kick but not enough to make the dish. never again. this place while trying to be different failed. top it off, the waitress was annoying and ditzy. meanwhile, Scramble next door had a long line almost out the door.",

We pretty much ordered off the pasta menu. I ordered the baked tortellini with a white and red cream sauce, it was missing any king of flavor, one of my friend ordered spaghetti carbonara, although it was not made in a traditional way and although the pasta was way over cooked , it had a pretty good flavor.  Like i said the place has a little charm but with very pricey food, 15 average for entree' , and very little flavor  it deserves just two 1/2 stars.",

    "text": "I'm assuming everyone was there for the Smart Shopper deal for 1/2 off menu items excluded the drinks and desserts.  It was a busy Friday night.  We seat by the open kitchen.  Every dish looked and smelled so good.  We got to watch the Suns vs. Lakers game on nice big screen TV.  The kids enjoyed the Chefs cooking, especially when the pans were on fire.  I had tried their White Wine Flight (InfmGoose  - Sauvignon Blac, New Age White, and NapaCreek Chard) - $9.00.  I like the flight, however the New Age White was over ice, and it was sort of diluted.  I'm glad that we ordered the appetizers crab cakes and soup/salad.  The clam chowder was full with crabs, so worth the $2.00 add-on to your meal.  I think they forgot us after the appetizers.  Our food took a while to arrive.  After sitting for about 15-20 minutes, our food finally arrived.  I had ordered the Four Seasons pizza that came with 2 slices of the seafood (scallop/shrimp), margherita, mushroom & plum tomatoes, and prosciutto with shaved parmesan.  The seafood pizza needs cheese and sauce.  It was basically scallop and shrimp on a pita bread.  The rest of the pizza was just OK. They do have excellent paste dishes.   My friends had the Seafood Manicotti, Linguini with clam, and another pasta dish, which I can't remember the name.  They were all phenomenal.  The Chicken Marsala was a bit dry.  As the weather cools, they have a great patio area to unwind.",

    "text": "For those wondering, the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupons work fine, however the incompetent staff at Il Posto couldn't and/or wouldn't figure out 18% for the included gratuity.  The coupon clearly states that it would be included, so no surprise there..... ...but a big WTF when I realized looking at the receipt that they had either purposefully or accidentally calculated exactly 20% as the autogratuity.  Now by saying it may have been an accident, I'm really pushing things and trying to be nice because I overall liked the place.  I cannot honestly come up with an explanation as to how a person who'd graduated 4th grade math could read a peice of paper saying 18% and then calculate 20%, unless is was blatantly done on purpose with the idea that the customer wasn't going to figure it out.  SHAME SHAME SHAME  The decor here is a mish-mash of old and new, good and bad, nice and ugly.  They've recently done (some) remodeling, since I saw a huge dumpster in the parking lot, but they aren't finished inside.  There are huge areas where exposed surfaces are in need of paint or drywall, and a huge sheet of plastic hung in a doorway behind us, swooshing with every breeze of a server walking by. The outside patio area did indeed look very neato, like a street in italy or new york.  Inside, they have a dining area with warm wood accents, a lit-up fountain, and dim lighting (which i liked, but the mrs said was making her feel woozy) right next to the kitchen area's flourescent light fixtures and flourescent lime green paint.  What classiness the first area had was lost with barely a shift of your glance, since there's no wall or anything separating the two areas. The very uncomfortable booths have hard wood back and a butt cushion that's token at best, with the bottom of the seat being way too long, so your back can't reach the seatback so you are forced to chose between sitting upright with no backrest at all, or slouching so badly that a painful arch is in your middle back.  The food had good and bad, as well.  The bread basket with pesto dip was superb, and like many others have said, we should've simply eaten that until full and then left.    The lady's ceviche was a huge portion, and said to be very good (didn't eat it), but the tortillas I did sample were overcooked, looking only slightly dark but tasting burnt.  My NY strip pizziaola - after being ordered as \"tell the chef to aim for between Medium and Medium Rare\" - arrived at barely even MR, but was tasty enough with all that garlicy marinara (*SLICES* of shaved garlic, like in Goodfellas!) that the extra juiciness was okay with me.  I used more of the appetizer bread to soak up the bloodiness.  Mmmmm aus juis  The other had a penne dish with chicken and mushrooms in a brown sauce.  This was said to be all just fine, but my keen eye saw the chicken going untouched and a few peices of penne being pushed around.  Probing proved that all was not just fine, since the chicken was quite dry, and the penne was so barely grasping to reach al dente doneness that she thought at first it might be whole wheat pasta (the dim lighting may have contributed also).  Service was 'eh'.  Yes, that's right.  It was so generic, by-the-book, make sure we cover all the requisite phrases and checking in moments -- but nothing more than that -- that I cannot even warrant the \"M\" to give them the entire 'meh'.    When inquiring if we'd like wine, and asked for Spumante, the server replied, \"you mean Spumoni?!? We don't have that.\" We looked at each other.....I so badly wanted to ask \"so, you don't have the wine, or you don't have the ice cream?\"....but we both just gave a tentative \"okaaaaaaay...\"    Chose not to try getting any wine.   8^ |  There was nothing too horrible about the service, but nothing great either......  EXCEPT of course there was the fact that someone involved in making up the bill decided to _*help themselves*_ to a 20% gratuity when the coupon states that an 18% gratuity is included.  Even with the mediocre service, I would have added a personal table tip to the auto-gratuity, but I certainly did not do that once I saw the 20% on the bill. I also chose not to bring it up with the server, because it was obvious that they already knew that it was calculated at 20%, and I wasn't about to play the whole Pretend It Was An Error game. There was no mis-reading the coupon. There was no mistake in the math. It was *calculated* at exactly 20% with intention. So that's what they got from me.  Nothing else.  ...except this review.",

    "text": "That has got to be one of the coolest patios in town for a get together.  I was another of the Yelp group (and friends) in attendance last night for happy hour.  We had a long table reserved for us.  The bartender was also our waiter for the evening.  To my knowledge, with all of us moving around, I don't think he screwed up a single order of food or drink.  The manager, Matt, came by to check on us several times.  I arrived fairly early and before I was tempted to work my way through multiple baskets of the wonderful bread and pesto I ordered a serving of crab cakes.  They were quite good, certainly not enough volume to replace an entree.  I was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious.  Of the many pizzas ordered I did not hear one person that was less than satisfied.  I do of sort regret not trying the white pizza but I was at that not full but no longer hungry point where I should, but don't always, stop.  We did cause one hiccup in the evening, many of us decided it was time to go at the same time and with all the separate bills to figure out at once it swamped the entire staff to the point a couple of people at the bar complained they couldn't get a drink.  Most of the night we ordered as individuals or pairs as we saw fit so we never overwhelmed the kitchen or the server.  I have yet to figure out why groups of people (non business) that are going to be there for a couple of hours anyway have to all order and get served at the same time.  We must have at least looked like we were well behaved, Matt invited us back.",

    "text": "After having driven past this charming little place every day for months, my boyfriend and I finally made it in for dinner. We were in the mood for a good thin crust pizza, but were open to whatever sounded good on the menu.  We sat on the patio and found it really charming, even though it was on the cool side that night and started to rain just as we were leaving. The fire pit was nice and warm and added a coziness that definitely added to the ambiance.  We did have a bit of a wait until the server greeted us, but after that it was pretty smooth sailing. The bread and pesto is, as everyone on here says, delicious!! It's how pesto should be....simple, fresh and garlicky!! We ordered one of their signature pizzas and that nights seafood pasta special to share and we were so impressed!! The pizza was perfect! The crust was just thick enough to support the generous toppings of spicy, Italian sausage, pepperoni, black olives, red peppers and onion. The crust was so crunchy/chewy/balanced and good that not a bit of it was left on the plate! The sauce and cheese were also perfectly balanced and delicious. Now on to the special. It was an amazingly generous and glorious mix of clams, mussels, calamari, scallops, and shrimp. All of the seafood tasted very fresh and was cooked to perfection...not overdone or chewy at all. The sauce was a bright, fresh and tasty tomato sauce that supported the seafood, but did not overwhelm the different flavor of each type. The presentation was amazing and it tasted even better than it looked. We also enjoyed a nice Sangiovese that was not too badly priced and are looking forward to returning for their Wednesday night wine special. It's nice to have found such a great little place in our neighborhood!",

The fresh bread and delicious pesto dip they brought out was a good sign of things to come. We decided to share 2 dishes, and ordered a baked pasta dish along with the eggplant pamigiana based on Sarabear's yelp review - who I hope spelled parmigiana right cuz I'm just copying her spelling =).   Well the eggplant was every bit as good as she said! All three of us were very impressed by this dish. The pasta, however, seemed to be lacking in flavor. It was decent, but paled in comparison.  We had a very hard time deciding what to order as there were many mouth-watering items on the menu from salads to sandwhiches, and ofcourse the pizza and calzones. I will definitely be back to try out some others. They are also in the process of opening a lounge attached to the restaraunt, so Iook forward to checking that out as well!",

    "text": "I have to say this is the very first time in my life that I have ever been so disappointed in a restaurant. First of all my family and I got there half and hour early by mistake, which was our fault but instead of just letting us sit down and look at the menu and grab us waters or something they sent us over next door to The Lounge. The Lounge was very nice but we felt bad going in there and not buying a drink so we ended up spending extra money there. The hostess also said she would come get us when they were ready and she never did. When we went in there was already another table seated... Remember throughout this that this restaurant is labeled \"INEXPENSIVE\"  The waitress was really nice but she didn't really seem to know much. Maybe she was new. Anyways,we ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. It was $7 and there were only 4 small mushrooms and they were BATHED in cheese sauce. It was not very good...and I love stuffed mushrooms. When the waitress asked how we liked it I was politely honest and let her know that it was just \"ok.\"   For our entrees we ordered a kids pasta with marinara ($4, didn't include anything else) and I have never seen such light marinara at an Italian restaurant! The sauce was definitely not made there, tasted like a grocery store brand sauce. My husband got the chicken marsala ($13) - the chicken and sauce were adequate, but we have no doubts in our mind that they used instant mashed potatoes. I ordered the clam linguini ($14) which came with a choice of red or white sauce. Now, when you have a choice between red or white don't you think of a creamy white sauce? Well, that was not the case. The dish came out and the sauce was light yellow and clearish; kind of like a butter sauce. I'm going to blame it on my pregnancy but I was really looking forward to the creamy white sauce. So, I told the waitress what I thought the menu meant and that I would like a bowl of creamy white sauce to put on it instead. No problem right....but oh wait, they charged me two dollars for a few ounces of alfredo sauce! Are you kidding me!? From the look of all the other cheap ingredients I'm sure it was cheap sauce, from a huge jar that they probably paid 5 bucks for. What happened to satisfying your customer? Especially after we did not enjoy our appetizer...  Il Posto is mislabeled and should have 2 $ signs instead.  I think when yelp said \"inexpensive\" they actually meant \"cheap.\" They charged way too much for their cheap ingredients and not so great customer service.  Needless to say we will not be going back...",

His crust is super. Every once in a while Ziggy's wife makes a bread pudding to die for. Always ask if it's available and if it is get it. You won't be disappointed if you like bread pudding. We've had very large parties at Ziggy's and never been disappointed with the food and the service.",

I grew up going to this restaurant and have watched it go through numerous changes in ownership (and names) to end up the very mediocre place it is now. They used to have the best pizza on the planet here, and now it's extremely bland and unmemorable, along with the rest of the food. The service here especially is absolutely dreadful now compared to what it used to be. The current owners have really changed this place for the worst. The whole restaurant has zero charm, and it was once a great neighborhood family Italian place with fun New-York-themed decorative touches.",

Can't comment on the food as we never ate there, after over an hour of waiting for our appetizers, we decided to leave and go somewhere else.   No manager ever came by, the \"lead\" server (I'm assuming as she's the only one that seemed to have a clue) attempted to handle the situation but ultimately the lack of service and the record breaking wait time for food were too much.

    "text": "We discovered this place last night from the door man at The Nash downtown. We were deeply disappointed to find out that the show we wanted to see was sold out. So I was in a grouchy mood when we got to Ziggy's. There were no tables available, they were all reserved...but the server kept an eye out for us and made sure we got a seat. I REALLY appreciated that! (She had no idea I was down in the dumps.)  Tony Vacca was playing sax and Delphine Cortez was singing jazz. Even though I know nothing about music, I could tell she is incredibly accomplished and has a very pure sounding voice. After some classic jazz songs like Girl from Ipanema (in which she lighheartedly rearranged words) she sang Ode to Billie Joe as a request for someone that was having a birthday. Wow! Amazing range to go from an ehterial jazz sound to a kind of earthy, deep bluesy, slightly twangy tone. There was a high school age boy (Tony's son?) playing trumpet who was really great. Delphine was challenging him to a duel with notes and he was able to emulate her high pitched challenge on the trumpet...which was really cute.  The prices were very good and the food quality was excellent. The Wine Lover's Board was beautifully presented. They rolled the prosciutto up into a little rose which was very charming. Then, they artfully drizzled a balsamic reduction over it. I get these types of boards all over the Valley and this one really stood out. (Some of the chef boards are pricey and lame...where it's more about charging a lot for a small amount of food atfully displayed.) My glass of wine was a very generous serving and was $11.00 dollars but it was one of the most expensive on the list. It was really nice to see wine by the glass that started around $7.00. Everyhting doesn't have to cost a fortune!   Considering there was live music and great food...I'd highly recommend this place. It has a really nice, friendly, kind of neighborhood vibe. Good cocktails too at reasonable prices.",

When we arrived we were given a menu without one. When I asked about kids spaghetti he told me that it would cost the same and be the adult serving. I said okay, then can they split it? I was then charged a $3 split fee on top of $12 for my two young children's spaghetti.  I understand split charges especially when there's salads or something involved but to literally put the spaghetti on two plates for my children to share was ridiculous. I should have just ordered one and split the plate myself.  I ordered the chicken piccata...now I like salt but this was ridiculously over salted. It's like they regularly salted the dish and then added the caper juice to it as well. I was hopeful that we had found an alternative to Carrabbas because we prefer locally owned businesses but unfortunately that wasn't the case.",

There are Christmas lights strung about in different locations, a small bar area, a lil fountain and some other cool decorations. It's worth a trip just to hang out in their decked out patio area, if only to have some drinks.  The service was awesome. Our waiter was totally cool, friendly and accommodating.   The fresh baked bread and oil with cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. Loved it.  They had local beer (Kiltlifter) on tap for only $3 a pint. awesome.  The salads and pasta entrees were just ok, which is the reason behind my 3 star rating. I just wasn't wowed by the main course.

Although it was my first visit and I generally like to sample a place a few times before reviewing, there were so many of us there that I felt that I had gotten a pretty well-rounded experience and had enough information to provide input.   Phoenix is known for its host of strip mall restaurants, but few can actually transport you to another place. The restaurant interior is a mix of kitschy Italian and moderately nice mainstream. The main patio is actually about the same size as the restaurant interior and is flanked by two cute NYC street scenes (think universal studios city scene) with each window telling a different story and the Statue of Liberty holding court. Very quaint! The back of the patio is taken up by a complete bar. The fire pit that others have mentioned is situated in the middle. The patio is clearly the place to be at this venue!  Service was spot on, which was unexpected for such a large group. I have to echo Georgie S., the bartender seemed to single handedly (with the exception of bussing support) kept our brood quenched and fed with no errors. He asked each guests name upon their initial order and remembered them throughout the remainder of the evening. No simple feet, if you consider that we had at least 20 people in our party and he was also serving the numerous other guests that shared our al fresco setting.  The manager Matt, came out to thank us for coming by and informed us that there is a separate patio in the back to accommodate private parties/functions. What a divine setting for almost any family or business gathering!  In addition to the ambience and service, there is the food... Oddly one of the best things of the evening was the free appetizer provided to each table, which consists of bread and a parmesan/pesto dipping sauce that is so infused with garlic that its sweet fragrance swirls in the air. Now as Bacon B. points out, this will stay with you (i.e.: if you are on a date, you should both eat some) but it is seriously out of this world! I also really enjoyed the bruschetta, which is a classic take on the dish in every aspect except size. More often than not you will receive four or six small slices of toast with some tomatoes and basil carefully assembled on top, but not here... instead you will be served a small flatbread mounded with fresh hand cut tomatoes, chiffonades of basil and more of that dreamy garlic.  I was also able to sample two of the new pizza offerings. The Roberto's (ironically offered up by the fabulous Robert M.), which was set off by a sprinkling of pepperocinis offering just a little kick, and the White pizza which had more of those rich garlic undertones. Although I enjoyed the toppings on each of the pizzas, I was left wanting more from the crust. Both were uniform in size and shape and a little on the tough / dense side, which made me wonder if they were not made in house. That said, it was not enough to detract from the overall experience and I will definitely be back in the near future.",

I'm surprised more hasn't been mentioned about their delish homemade potato chips.  I've been known to skip the salad so that I could fill up on more chips. I'm usually like meat, but went with the margherita pizza last night and I can say I'm impressed.  The bread and pesto sauce were also excellent. With great atmosphere and good food, I'll definitely go back.",

My favorite Yelper, Christina P, put together a UYE here last night, and the event could not have been more perfect.  The bartender and staff were really friendly and made us feel very welcome. They have a fantastic patio with a fire pit in the middle which made for a perfect happy hour setting.  We happened to be there on the night they unveiled their specialty pizza line. I had the pleasure of trying both the margharita and the goat cheese & onion, both of which I thought were fantastic. They also serve bread with a cheesy pesto dipping sauce that was to die for.  Our group ending up trying a lot of different pizza's and everyone seemed to really enjoy.  I was pleased with their happy hour specials ($2 off specialty pizzas; $1 off appetizers, well drinks, house wines and draft beers) and especially pleased that they extended those specials for our group for the entire time we were there.  This is another time I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I would give Il Posto a 4.5... and I will definitely be back to grab another glass of the Chateau Ste. Michelle Riesling and snack on one of those delish speciality pizza's on the patio!",

    "text": "3 1/2 Stars  Alright, I'll try and make this one short and sweet and follow the old expression \"If you don't have anything nice to say...\" because I really did like parts of Il Posto...  Let me start by saying that the staff was incredible!  About 20 or so of us Yelpers gathered yesterday for a Happy Hour organized by the fantastic Christina P and the staffers were very pleased to oblige.  Like Bacon B said before me, I'm always nervous about being a part of a large party because it is practically inevitable that they are going to screw up at least some of our orders, and it is guaranteed that mine will always be one of them.  That said this was sooo not the case here.  I was shocked!  We sat outside and were all served at our leisure by 1 bartender who I from here on out will refer to as Superman, because he obviously had some sort of magical powers to serve all 20 of us individually, simultaneously, and screwed up no one's orders mind you...  I'll continue to touch on the good.  The patio was great.  Very spacious area with a fire pit in the middle which added some lovely ambiance to the evening, and hey, who doesn't look better by firelight??   Now on to the less than good...  The Happy Hour specials were okay, to be honest I'm not thrilled by $1 off of things, I think it's kind of weak.  However, many of Il Posto's drink prices were already fairly low, so the $1 off could sway some.  First of all, I will say that their fresh bread and pesto dip which was free mind you was delicious.  The pizza though, not so much...Let me preface this by saying that I am from NYC and I take my pizza very seriously...it is a bit of an art for me  I don't want to say too much because I do want to go back and try some different things because the rest of the experience was lovely, but no, unfortunately, I did not enjoy my pizza.  It was undercooked, the dough was unimpressive, and I had to use a knife and fork because it was so soggy.  All in all I had a nice time at Il Posto, mainly because of the company, but I would be willing to go back and give it another shot.",

Small bar, lots of tables, some open space, hearty gas fire pit in the middle, screened on all sides (with some very ornate facades, a wall painted like a billboard, hilarious \"laundry line\" replete with underwear and socks over head, and so on to break up the boring \"screen wall\" and add ambiance).  They have a gate towards the parking lot that keeps it from being claustrophobic, but the gate is small enough to keep out the noise from nearby 7th St.    I didn't personally try the food, but it did look good.  Definitely want to check it out sometime soon.    The one area they really need to improve would be the bathrooms.  With as much effort as they put into the patio, the bathrooms should be a few steps up from the nearby gas station.  That's really my only quibble at this point, and I won't deduct stars b/c I don't typically spend a lot of time in the bathroom.    Anyway, Il Posto is a great place, I'll definitely be back.  I may even brave the an evening or two during the coming summer months under a mister on that awesome patio, beer in one hand and pizza in the other...",

The first thing I missed when I had been here a month or 2 was good Italian food.  There are plenty of people that have claimed they found good Italian food here or there, but when I tried it, i found the places were serving something that may have included pasta, but had nothing else in common with Italy... so now after years of searching to find really good Italian food in the Phoenix area,  I can count all the really good places on one hand...  Il Posto is one of them.  In addition, it is a very reasonably priced place with a wonderful patio.  Their eggplant parmigiana is some of the best I have ever had.  The layers of eggplant are thin and perfectly crispy before they bake the whole thing in cheese and sauce.  The pasta on the side has a wonderful light fresh marinara.  Their scampi sauce is garlicky, but not too much.... and their Alfredo is made per order with the best cream, butter and cheese.  It's so rich that I have to limit myself to a once a year thing when I order their tortellini.  For lunch, try a Caesar salad, or a paninni.  This is one place where you don't have to explain what you mean if you want a white pizza.  It's already on the menu.    The patio is well placed and has fountains and plants to keep away all parking lot noise.  The decorations are fun and endearing to people who have spent any time in NYC's little Italy.... right down to the painted Mulberry Street sign and the laundry hanging on the lines overhead.  Now, I hear they have rented the storefront that is immediately east of their place and are opening a bar called \"the lounge.\"  I hope it will be as fun to go there as it has been to sit at the bar on their patio.  I will be thrilled to have another neighborhood hangout.",

I didn't much care for the crust of the pizza, but the pizza itself was very flavorful. My drink of the night was a strawberry lemonade alcoholic beverage that the bartender was having trouble getting right. Each time I had to help him out with the formula of sweet to sour, but he was a good sport about it. Our large group sat out on their clean a pretty patio. It grew chilly so they lit the fire pit for us. I can imagine sitting on the patio and enjoying drinks with friends here.  I would most certainly visit Il Posto again.

The location was nice for the Happy Hour we all attended because it was a short drive from work.  Parking was adequate as well.  Everyone was out on the cool patio enjoying drinks that they have a couple bucks off of at this time.  They had Peroni on tap which was a plus.  The pizza I had was only so-so.  I love and know pizza and have had some fabulous pizza in my day.  This one, not so much.  The potential is there, but something was missing.  Not sure if it needed to be cooked longer or what, but it was a little soggy.  The mushrooms were fresh which was nice, as opposed to canned.  The only other thing I had was the bread and pesto dip.  I should have and could have eaten this all night!  The bread was warm and crusty on the outside and soft inside.  The \"Green Goo\", which I called it all night, was awesome!  I would like to go back and try some different dishes to get a better sense of the food.  Very cool patio with a neat sand fire pit.  Perfect for the nights we are all enjoying right now.  3 stars for now...",

The meat tortellini with alfredo AND marinara sauce covered with their thick smooth mozzarella is one of my top 10 dishes of all time.  I get extra of their tasty marinara.  You can't get this anywhere else and the mix of flavors and textures in this pasta dish are unbelievable in your mouth.  The only thing I don't like about here is the service... we have been going here since it was called Our Gang Cafe and the teenage hostesses are pathetic and the servers are a bit douchy.  They chill in the back gossiping like schoolgirls looking around at everyone in the place. When it looks as if your table might need something, they casually get up from their seats as if a burden of service has come upon them. I don't like it.. but I've never known them to be any other way so ehhh.  A good little Italian restaurant, while it may not make you feel all warm inside while their indoor center fountain splashes you throughout your meal, they have good foods so I'll be back.",

The bread and pesto is something both my wife and I always look forward to, as well as the friendly and very attentive staff.  My wife almost always has the baked tortellini: a great mix of tortellini and bubbling cheese thats always filling and satisfying. The linguini with clam sauce really should be clam with linguini -- the clams are so plentiful that you can barely see the linguini and quite garlicy to boot. The lasagna is huge and quite good, as are the regular specials of Zuppe de Pesche (a huge platter of seafood over linguini) and the Veal Sorentino, a wonderfully tasty dish of waffer-thin veal and eggplant with cheese and a delightful mushroom sauce. Recently they've had Manhattan clam chowder as a soup special, and its really fantastic -- I'm not a fan of the red chowder normally, but theirs is really top notch: plenty of clams, nice spicy broth. Its a must-order if its a special, as is the Veal.  The standout desert is the hazelnut tortufo, with the cheesecake and creme bulee being good and nicely dressed.  The decor is a bit odd -- they've recently redecorated with weird \"fairy\" wood and glass sculpture things that really need to be tossed out, and a few odd \"rustic farm implements\" that clash with the modern crisp decor.  But the food is top notch, and the decor is just a point of dinner conversation.",

The menu, as MOST Italian restaurants done on the West coast, lacks authenticity. It seemed bare. Not bare enough for me to not want to leave, just lacking the stuff I want to see from NY/NJ menus.

Beside the point anyway, for me. The food is fantastic, especially their seafood dishes and the PIZZA,  love the thai pizza. Atmosphere i great, cute patio area with a bar, not to hot later in the evening. They have specialty cocktails that are all great and  unique.

We noticed two servers attending to tables on the other side of the room but they never came around to our table. After about 10 minutes the head bartender came over with water and said he'd be back for our drink order. About 20 minutes later a waitress finally came to our table but told us she was ONLY getting drink orders and would \"be right back\" for food orders. We got our drinks about 15 minutes after that and then around 7:40 the waitress returned to take our order. At that point my husband asked for a refill on his water and the waitress said someone would be coming around to fill our waters. At 8pm my husband went to the bar for water because surprise! No one came to our table to refill water. At the bar, he noticed a lot of bread baskets and he asked if we were supposed to get bread. Another server said yes and was surprised we didn't have any. He brought some out to us promptly and it was hot and tasted good. Real butter was a nice touch. Around 8:20 we got our calamari appetizer. It was ok. Over salted but luckily not overcooked. At 8:45 we noticed the waitress apologizing to a few tables near us for the wait and was answering questions they were asking her. She got around to our table about 5 minutes later to take our appetizer plates and just said sorry it's taking so long it's not my fault. I asked if she knew how much longer it would be and she gave a very curt, agitated reply that the order is in and it's not her fault, then she walked away. We finally got our food around 9pm. Luckily it was hot, and the waitress who brought it (not the one who had been tending to our table) also got more bread for us very quickly. The food was good, extremely generous portions, but ultimately not worth the wait. At that point the band was taking a break and when we had finished eating didn't even feel like staying for the second set. My husband went to the bar for the check (because who knows how long we would have waited otherwise), and we left 2-1/2 hours after arriving. Not once did the waitress ask how our food was or stop to check on us. I get it, they were super busy and normally I'm pretty forgiving when it's obviously busy but to basically ignore our table while people seated at the bar came, got food, and left before we even got a status update on our order is inexcusable. The main restaurant may be good, but we will not be returning to give it a shot. The music was good, but not good enough to deal with that level of service again.  TL/DR: Don't go to the lounge for the music if you also want to eat.",

Our server, a gentleman I'd guess to be in his 50's, seemed to be new to food service.  He was timid, never introduced himself, and didn't seem to know the menu.  We had to repeat our order, and even point it out on the menu.  He was not meant to be a food server.  The food was okay, nothing spectacular.  We started with the calamari.  We've had worse, but we've also certainly had better.  It didn't have any real flavor and wasn't as golden in color as we like.  For entrees, I had the Baked Ziggy's Ziti with a meatball ($5 extra for a meatball - yes, just 1 apparently - and our server actually wasn't sure if it was $5 for just one. He never actually answered that question.).  The ziti was very cheesy and just ok, and the meatball was unexciting.  Not a lot of flavor on that either and made me question if it was homemade or previously frozen.  My husband had the rigatoni Bolognese.  I tasted a bit of the sauce and it had some decent basil flavor, but other than that,  he wasn't all that impressed either.  Overall, I don't think we'll be back since there are a number of other really good Italian dining options in our area that we like.",

I caught the servers eye and waved, She like turns around and acts like she didn't notice and commences to put silverware away. That pissed me off! I flagged down a bus boy and literally said WTF! Our waitress has become a ghost. Wel we finally got our drinks. And my Second refill I noticed was Cheap Scotch, It was darker and had a totally different taste, Not as smooth.

They were not that busy and yet we waited an hour and a half for our orders to arrive. Our very apologetic server told us that they were short handed in the kitchen. I heard other servers apologizing to other guests. It is sad that servers get put in that position. They ran out of one of the pasta dishes that we ordered but we weren't told about it until 45 minutes after we ordered and that point we just went with 3 entrees. I will say that the food that we did get was good, but, based on past reviews where long waits for orders happened I seriously doubt that I will roll the dice on this place again.",

The main dining area was cozy and lit just right for a relaxing atmosphere, with Italian-American songs playing softly at the background. After our very friendly server took our orders, we had a bit of time for conversation as the dishes were prepared; fast food it definitely is not, but it is worth the wait. The seafood manicotti I ordered was delicious: a variety of tender seafood packed in pasta tubes cooked just a little softer than al dente - just the way I was hoping it would be. The creamy, cheesey sauce was heavenly -- and thank goodness the freshly baked bread they provided allowed me to wipe up every little bit from my plate. A good chardonnay made for a perfect pairing, and because we came at 6 pm, it was offered at a happy hour price (happy hour ends at 7 pm, even on Sunday). In all it was a delightful way to cap another year of yelping with my friends.",

The Fra Diavlo appetizer calamari was very rubbery, a shame cuz the sauce was very good and kind of spicy. The arugula salad with apples that we ordered, came with really no arugula. It was nothing more than stems and look like a bunch of weeds in our salad. We sent it back and they comped it for us. We have had it many times before and it was delicious . Our server was very nice, told us that she work there three days a week, yet did not know anything about the menu, anything about the special that night or had no idea what the bar had to offer for cocktails and or beers! If it wasn't for the amazing ambience of the patio and the fact that we have had amazing meals here before, I do not know if I would return. We might try it one more time in hopes the food, service or any combination will be better.  Shame..this was my lil hidden gem back in the day....They need to train their staff and get back to the quality they used to have.  Miss it!!",

It came with home made potato chips. ( Always a plus-yum) and greens to boot (Because you know your body needs those vitamins) The meal was great. I ordered a side servng of an Italian sausgage( My weakness and hard to find good in Az)  One was enough to feed 4. A little spicy and good. The only thing I did not care about was the sauce it was served on. I come from a place where sauce is called gravy and I like sauce thick not thin. But hey, I did not expect the sausage to have any sauce on it so no big deal to me. It was delish!I ended with Tiramusu, always a nice ending. I went home with a 20 extra pounds on my hips and in leftover doggie bags. AHHHHH sweet heaven!",

Try it out. You will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "This place is just OK.    I'm not sure why everyone, despite whether they like this place or not, seems to think the bread and pesto/olive oil dipping sauce is so spectacular.  Its didn't strike me as that great.  Though I've had homemade pesto (yum) so I'm a bit spoiled I guess.  Our server was great.  She was very friendly, energetic and attentive.    The portions here are small.  I ordered the ravioli.  For the price I would expect more than 6 small ravioli.  Had they been larger, homemade and absolutely delicious I'd feel differently.  But these were your run of the mill, frozen grocery store ravioli.  And I was hungry when I was finished - wishing there were a few more ravioli on the plate.  The hubs had the manicotti, which was slightly better than the ravioli but also a small portion.    The highlight of the meal was dessert.  I had the chocolate tartufo (chocolate ice cream with nuts, chocolate chips and whipped cream) which was delicious.  The hubs ordered the creme brulee which came topped with fruit.  Different but very tasty.",

Found this place via <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> so we decided to check it out. Place appears to be a cute little mom and pop shop, we walked in shortly after 830 on a Saturday so it was an hour and a half  before closing.  The hostess was super nice and sat us right down and said the waitress would be with us soon. A long while passed and it took a reminder and apology from the hostess, but our waitress finally stopped talking with the other waiter long enough to come take our drink and food order.  While we were waiting for the food to come the real show started.......the waiter was coming in and out of the back to the waitress station eating what appeared to be chicken wings, our waitress and the hostess sat down at a table and shared a plate of pasta, and the most concerning item was the bar tender from the lounge side.   He came over to pick up a salad and as he has the customers salad in his one hand, he's sucking on his e cigarette with his other hand. I tried to grab my phone to catch this but he quickly walked back to the other side with the salad.  When he came back to the kitchen he was waiting for a pizza in the pizza oven and the was running his hands through his hair and rubbing his nose, then handled the pizza. Gross!!!!  Then the food came and somehow it made all the horrible service worth it.  It was amazingly delicious.  We had 3 dinners, an appetizer, and a dessert and all of them were perfect.  The 4 men in the kitchen working totally made up for the 4 slackers working the front of the house.  I would say if you like waffle house, you will love this place because based on the front, service, and sanitation habits of the front of the house, I would rate it a 1 star. If you base it on the food alone I would give it 5 stars.  If you can ignore poor service for good food, give it a try.",

I was thinking that the bad reviews were from people who were used to corporate chains and processed foods.  I really got that wrong. If you are expecting Italy or Naples style food, you too will be greatly let down as I was.  I had several texts to warn me when I checked in here for dinner.  I should have listened. Pasta was overcooked.  Floating in a butter sauce, literally.  So much poor quality cheese on everything.  Pizza was like frozen style maybe before it was frozen.  Smothered in greasy cheese on a boring crust. We had 2 dinners and 2 pizzas.  We ate about 1/3 and felt sick from the heavy, cheesy, oily, buttery and greasy food.  I may have to have a cholesterol medication after this.  Even my dinner salad had about a cup of cheese pellets on top of it.  I've not seen mozzarella in this form before.  What is going on here?  Maybe I would have thought this was good when I was in my teens.  I think that this place has a lot going for it, but not it's food.",

You really feel like you have a little piece of New York in Phoenix.    We got the bruchetta which was very good. My husband got a seafood special which was loaded with all different kinds of shellfish. I had the pizza and while it was good, I would suggest getting a pasta dish. All of the pastas looked amazing and the pizza looked reminiscent of a frozen pizza.",

They also don't serve cappuccino or espresso so plan on going elsewhere for desert.    The lounge next door is apparently under the same ownership, and is a great place to enjoy a glass of wine and some anti pasta before dinner.",

In fact, it was the best thing I had.   I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, and the stuffing was repulsive. It was dark black  and resembled mushed up soggy bread. I had to ask what it was, because besides tasting like bland mushy yeasty dough- it looked disgusting. They assured me it was mushrooms and bread crumbs cooked in white wine with seasoning- it may have been mushrooms and left-over stale bread, but I am certain there wasn't any seasoning- not even salt. Not good. I removed the stuffing and just ate the mushroom in the rich, cheesy orange sauce the shrooms were drown in. The sauce was tasty, but it's hard to make cream and melted cheese taste bad.  I actually make some pretty killer stuffed mushrooms at home- I would not serve Il Posto's  in my  kitchen- they were just bad.  I also had a simple dinner salad. It had canned olives, processed, maybe pre-shredded mozzarella- it came with a pre-made dressing. When they said, \"raspberry vinaigrette\"- I was not expecting a creamy pink pepto-bismol looking dressing. So weird...  Maybe I am just too much of a foodie... sheesh. I rarely eat canned olives, processed cheese and I make all of my salad dressings... it's pretty easy to make a vinegarette- there's usually only 2 main ingredients.   My wine was also not very good.  My server was nice, the hostess was nice, the manager was nice- I will say that although my server was nice- she presented herself very ditsy. I asked what was good on the menu and mentioned that I am vegetarian, but on occasion eat seafood- she was not able to recommend anything- she said, \"It depends on what you like... tee hee tee hee hee\". She sort of spoke in a baby talk way and giggled quite a bit- she also kept calling me \"Doll\", which was annoying. I think I caught her about to twirl her hair at one point. All the servers looked very young- almost like a harem of female teens. It is an interesting dynamic. I would not be surprised to find out the hiring manager is a man in his 20s to early 30s. Anyhow, they were nice- it's just the ditsy act is off-putting, unprofessional.  All in all- I have always wanted to try this place as I hike in the area often and have tried all the other restaurants around. The patio looked pretty cool- if cactus weren't wilting outside at dusk (summers in Phoenix- ugh). I will not be back though- The tacos next door are about 75% less expensive and 200% better tasting.",

    "text": "This is by far the best Italian food I have had in Phoenix. I went there for a date with my boyfriend, he had the spaghetti and fried mozzarella (made in house fresh). I had the seafood manicotti (best I've ever had by far), stuffed mushroom caps and a caprese salad. First of all I want to kiss the genius who created the brandy cream sauce for the mushrooms. It was phenomenal. Second the seafood manicotti actually had a bunch of seafood in it which is rare and appreciated. The caprese salad was more than the basic tomato and cheese  with basil combo. They added roasted red peppers and artichokes and it was large enough to share. The friendly bartender Mel helped me choose a great wine that paired perfect with my meal . She also kept the man happy with great mixed drinks that didn't taste watered down like most bars. The atmosphere was beautiful . We sat on the patio and enjoyed the decorative lights and Italian themed building in the background. For a second it really took you out of Phoenix and made you feel like you were on vacation. The owner introduced herself and treated us like family. It is everything I miss in restaurants these days. The family operated , great food, great music, great decor and awesome overall environment. I Definitely have found our new Friday spot.",

The front patio has a big fire pit that warms up the area on a chilly evening. The atmosphere is great, doesn't feel like you're in a plaza or anything. The food has been on point. The baked tortellini is awesome! The warm bread is amazing! Friday's seem to be pretty busy. Ziggy, the owner, is super personable and chatted with us for a bit. Our new favorite spot!",

Our service was wonderful our waitress was amazing our lunch was perfectly cooked, we had two appetizers, fried calamari, and the stuffed mushrooms they were both to die for. While we were waiting to order chef Greg Ziggy took his time out to come over to ask us if we had any questions regarding the menu, Or to see how we were doing. In all my years I've never had a Chef  himself come to our table, made us feel real special. My husband ordered a seafood manicotti and I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and I asked the Chef if he can substitute the chicken for shrimp instead and he was very accommodating and my daughters split a meat lovers pizza. The food was amazing everything was well cooked, Can't wait to go back. Thank you Chef Greg Ziggy",

Ziggy & his family/staff are all great people. They let us throw a pre-wedding family mixer, and accommodated us so well! Food came out fresh & hot, and the family had a blast.  As for the food, the restaurant includes some of the best sandwiches I've ever had. My parents' favorite is the Italian Bistro, and for me it's a toss-up between the BMTA & grilled chicken club. Ziggy's bread is homemade and very tasty! Crusty on the outside, and seasoned nicely. You can tell he puts a lot of love into his food.",

    "text": "I had such a great time at Il Posto!  We came here for dinner.  The weather was nice so we sat on the patio.  I love the ambience of their outdoor space.  It's like you're at a cafe in Little Italy.  They start you off with warm crusty bread and served with the most delicious dipping sauce.  It was olive oil with pesto and garlic.  So good!  For appetizers we ordered calamari and the seafood fra diavolo.  If you can handle a little heat I highly recommend the seafood fra diavolo.  It's calamari and shrimp in a spicy marinara sauce.  It's served with grilled bread for dipping.  It's out of this world!  For my main dish I had the cheese manicotti.  It was good, but I could barely touch it because it was so full from the appetizers.  I did take it home and I ate it for lunch the next day.   They were very generous on the cheese.  That's awesome because I really love cheese!    My husband ordered the chicken marsala.  I didn't try it all, but I snuck in a taste of the mushroom sauce. Mmm!  Our server was so attentive the entire night.  We were there with our Aunt and Uncle and between the four of us we devoured 3 baskets of their crusty bread.  (I told you it's good.). I loved how the servers were so willing to bring out more for us.  Excellent customer service.  Generous food portions.  Flavorful comfort food.  Il Posto has it all.",

After meeting up with my \"little\" brother, I decided to take him to dinner there and check the place out.  Ambience: old world Italy mixed with Lady and the Tramp and a pizza joint. The patio is lovely, especially at dusk and in the evening, and was the popular place to sit. Try and get seated near the firepit if possible, as their portable heaters appear to be out. Reservations accepted (that's why we weren't able to sit near the firepit).  Service: below what I expected though not below average. Our server took quite a long time to take our order and also took a long time to bring out another basket of bread. There's also like, 3 separate menus: one for drinks, one for pizzas and one for the rest of the food.  Food: I ordered the mussels appetizer, but requested that they cook it in a white wine sauce, as opposed to the marinara/basil sauce offered on the menu. They obliged. It was pretty tasty, though some of the mussels were overcooked and very tough to get out of the shell. My brother ordered chicken alfredo (wah wah) and surprise, was not that impressed with it; he claims it was bland and tasteless.   Price:  both of our meals were in the $12-15 range, a fair price considering the large portions. I didn't finish mine and my brother took half of his home.  For best success: reserve a table for 6PM near the firepit on the patio, bring a smokin' hot date and share a big bottle of their finest wine. And their delicious pesto/olive oil mixture with a basket of hot bread.... molto bene!",
