    "text": "I placed a take out order thru Yelp and it was a great experience.  When I placed my order, I added an additional note and asked for all white meat and extra sauce.  Normally when I order online with a special request, it is always ignored.  Not here though.  They were able to accommodate me with no issues.  I knew there would be an extra charge but when I picked up my order, it was only $1 more.  I don't carry cash on me so I wasn't able too but told them to go ahead and charge my card if they needed too and the guy at the counter said not to worry about it.  I appreciate that.  I ordered enough food to last a couple of days and the portions were perfect.  I ordered the fried dumplings, lunch combo of orange chicken with brown rice and an order of crab puffs.  (they might be called crab angels here).  Everything was great from ordering, picking up, to eating it.  I would recommend and I plan on going back.  Thank you .",

I don't even think they got the delivery right. I'm on the second floor and no one ever knocked or called. I get a text message saying your food is by the door and I left it there. There was no food by any of the doors at my complex. On top of that when I texted back and asked why they just didn't call. They replied with F*** Y***. I called the restaurant only to have the person hang up on me. I called back twice. Answered the third time. Said I couldn't get a refund. They then said I can call Eat24 for a refund. I asked for a manager and they said there is no manager. Then they hung on me. I've never been treated this way. I'm also repeating this place to the BBB and Paypal because that's how I orders. Worst experience of my life after waiting an entire hour for food! Wow.",

The staff are really friendly and the heart behind it all is the young asian cashier who's really awesome.  Order by phone and the meal will be ready for pick up in 15 minutes! I've only ate my food once in restaurant but I would do it again because they gave me the wifi password and hot and sour soup as I waited.   As for the food, I stay consistent with my selections. The fried dumplings (potstickers) are really good and plump with no skimping on the meat. The lo-mein and fried rice are essential dishes that are done well. The beef broccoli, honey walnut shrimp, Chinese eggplant with brown sauce are my favorite dishes that I recommend.   All in all, if you live in Tempe this is the go-to Chinese spot.",

Restaurant does not serve fountain drinks, but does have a varied selection of bottled and canned beverages. 2 litres of soda also available.  Lunch specials come with egg drop soup and fried wontons. Egg drop soup was a little bland, but overall not bad. Wonton chips were crispy and not oily. Husband ordered teriyaki chicken with brown rice, I ordered Szechuan chicken with brown rice. Teriyaki chicken was full of flavor. Sauce tastes of honey! Szechuan chicken had good spice, but was not as flavorful as the terikyaki sauce. Would probably order something else in the future.  Brown rice was very dry and seemed slightly undercooked.  Vegetables appeared fresh and were not overcooked and mushy.  Would certainly eat here again based on customer service and prices alone. Food was decent.",

I had intentions of apologizing and providing a $10 tip. I hadn't tipped on my card in advance, planned on using cash or adjusting when we signed the receipt.. (I never do tip in advance, after once tipping $7 for a pizza that was a 45 min late.) Again, this was a complete accident and I felt horrible for my mistake. But when the driver showed up he was so angry, he shoved the food at my boyfriend, and walked away while he was trying to apologize.   The food was great. But I'll never order from here again. Which I'm sure is fine with them. They don't seem to want my business because of an honest mistake. My freaking bad!! I tried to make it right and they didn't give a shit.  I can understand that this was frustrating. But you shouldn't be rude to paying customers. Even if they screwed up. You have no idea how bad I felt, or what my intentions were.",

The beef was not as tender as some of my prior encounters with this dish and slightly larger than bite sized pieces (yet no knife to cut the meat was provided). The brown rice was slightly dry and not seasoned. The sauce was a brown thin gravy type sauce. The portion was large and included the obligatory fortune cookie. The meal did not include any soup nor crab puff nor egg roll (I ate in, this was not a to-go order).   This appears to be a family business. The young man taking my order smiled and was friendly. The facility was clean and the tables and chairs were clean. There was only one other customer in the restaurant and only one take out order while I was there. It was quite warm and there was a portable air conditioner a few feet away from me, but it was still warmer than comfortable.There is ample parking close to the door. I would categorize this business as an average Americanized Chinese food establishment.",

    "text": "I spent several weeks looking for a good Chinese restaurant to compare to the ones I loved in the Atlanta area.  I finally stumbled on Beijing Express for lunch and was greatly pleased.  In Atlanta, for lunch, many Chinese restaurants offer a number of entrees at reduced prices and lunch portions from dinner.  The lunches usually come with a cup of soup (small bowl) and a spring roll.  The places I tried first were of mixed quality and taste.  The best one had great quality food and wonderful flavors, but you bought a dinner portion for lunch.  They only had two soups - dinner portions also.  Then, I found Beijing Express.  The decor is nothing to write about, and the restaurant is small, but I was met at the door by a young man with a smile who proceeded to take my order (you do that before you sit).  He was helpful with my choices.  The meals are lunch-sized and come with a spring roll.  The soup is separate, but the prices are very good, so I always order the won ton.  The pork Egg Foo Young I ate there was very good, as was the Mongolian Beef the next visit.  The flavors are very good, especially for the price.  Both times I ate there, the price was under $10!  There are other places I've read about and want to try, but Beijing Express has made me very happy!",

I had sweet and sour pork and the other 2 people in our party had sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  All of the entrees were great.  White rice and brown rice were both perfect.  We got an appetizer of fried dumplings.  I would usually prefer these to be a little more crispy when they're fried but they were quite delicious.  The restaurant is very small, you order at the counter and they bring you the food to your table.  No public restrooms that we could see.  Staff were busy in the back but did come take our order and deliver food.  Beyond that we didn't see them.  Food was really good, prices were fair for what you get.  I'd definitely eat here again if I was in the area.",

The restaurant is clean, but not air conditioned, so delivery is best. Customer service is okay as long as you don t need to communicate anything too complex. Keep it strictly  to ordering menu items and drinks and you'll be good.  These folks are straight from the old country, and their English, or lack there of, definitely shows this to be True. Overall the food is pretty good except for , ironically, the  3 main staples of Oriental cuisine --Teriyaki Chicken,  Fried Rice & Egg Rolls.  These are some of the worst I have had anywhere.  So,  if these are what you had your heart set on, Jack in the Box does it better. (I love Jack in the Box Egg Rolls...to die for)   Now there are some things that I order ALL THE TIME  that DEFINITELY make up for their misgivings and they are:     The #T- 6 House Special Won Ton Soup ---some of the best  Won Ton soup I've ever had. Just make sure you say \"HOUSE SPECIAL\" Won Ton Soup or they will  give you plain Won Ton Soup, which is still good, but the house special has chicken, shrimp, beef, pork and FRESH veggies. This soup is OUTSTANDING and worth coming in for if not for anything else. Also good are the Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken, Moo Shoo Chicken and S & S Pork. I know it is weird that they don't have the 3 staples, but the rest of the food on the menu MORE than makes up for it!  Did I say how awesome the \"House\" Won Ton Soup is here?",

    "text": "Good American style Chinese food, nice service.  I was in town for work, and one night I wasn't feeling well and did not want to leave the hotel. So I found this place on Yelp and luckily they have delivery service. I found their menu on the Yelp app and ordered over the phone. The lady on the phone was very nice and patient with me and answered all my questions. I ordered the wonton vegetable and pork soup as well as the broccoli beef, my favorite. She informed me that delivery will be no extra charge! woohoo, but it will take about an hour, which is totally to be expected.   about 40min later, I get a call and soon after a knock on my room door and I got my food. The guy who delivered was very nice and things was packaged well. I did give him a fat tip for his troubles, and they do accept credit cards. The food tasted great and my soup was full of veggies and meat. The broccoli beef dish was loaded with soft stir fried beef, slightly salty but good with brown rice. My only complaint is that the to go bag did not contain ANY eating utensils, which was a huge problem. I had to ask the hotel to bring me a fork.",

I was really only wanting the pork fried rice but there's a 15$ minimum for delivery.  About a third of the way in to eating my rice I discover a BUG. A FLY looking bug with like a stinger on the end. I am so disgusted by it that I Dont think I can eat the rest of the meal.  I called Beijing Express and they said they'd refund me the rice, but I had to contact GrubHub because that's where I ordered off of.   I am currently talking to a GrubHub customer service rep to try and get my $$ back.    All in all EWWWW",

I have ordered from Beijing Express about a half dozen times and have never been disappointed,  In fact, I have had nothing but amazing food and service from them.    Is it \"authentic\" Chinese food?  I dont know, I have never been to china.  but it is delicious, fresh, and the portions are huge and  make for good leftovers.    So far my favorite is the Mongolian beef, extra spicy, and an egg roll with the home made spicy mustard.  I am a big fan of spicy mustard, and this stuff is HOT!!  Make sure you ask for the home made stuff, as they also have the standard issue packets of hot-ish mustard.  So is it a five star take your  business clients from China out to lunch to impress them restaurant?  Probably not, but its the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona.",

    "text": "Make no mistake, this isn't fine dining, nor is it authentic Chinese food. Beijing Express excels in your typical Americanized Chinese fast food, with old stand bys such as General Tso's chicken and chop suey. We stopped by for an eat-in experience, and browsed through the menu before deciding on kung pao chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, and tofu with broccoli. Service was friendly, fast, and efficient as our order was prepared and served in near record time.   I appreciated that we were served a little bag of crispy wonton strips with sweet and sour sauce, with some egg drop soup. The soup was piping hot and a generous portion. When our meals came out, they were a heaping portion on the styrofoam plate, with plenty of rice to go with it. The kung pao chicken had a nice heat to it, from the added mixture of whole dried red chilis, while the eggplant and tofu had more of a sweet brown sauce. While our food tasted fresh and flavorful, make no mistake this isn't in any way healthy, as the sauces were an unctuous mixture, glistening with oil.   There were plenty of leftovers to take back from ordering 3 dishes for just the two of us. Each dish was under $10, most of them hovering around the $7 range. They do not have a soda fountain, and all drinks are by the bottle.  Generally, if you are craving some fast food Chinese, this is definitely a good option for price, freshness, and quantity.",

If you're in the PV area, go with Golden Wok. That place has been stellar for decades.",

Two - I'm eating with my Asian friends and would not offer to go to any resturant in category One.  Bejing Express falls into category One.  This is not a bad thing, it just means I look at the food different and compare it to the tastes that may not know better.    I had a delivery and it was really fast.  Food came hot and the order was correct. Now the important part the taste.  Overall it was good.  If I had a double order of noodles I would have happily devoured it with no regrets.  The other dish Mao po tofu was spicy and good.  It did have a different flavor then what I'm used to but that it never surprises me when it's outside my norm range.  To me their food stilled retained an authentic type taste but there is a different taste in the more authentic resturants.  It's not something I can pin point exactly so this may not make sence to some people.  So let me put it this way.  I can eat the best potstickers in the valley and will enjoy every bite.  But compare that to good potstickers in Asia, that's where I want to eat more.  I plan on adding this place I to my rotation I enjoyed the food and service.  I would highly recommend stop going to that place with the panda and come here insread.  You get more options and the food is better.  I understand some people need their fix but why not get your fix with better tasting food.",

I've had veggie dishes, beef, and chicken, all of which were very good, and a really delicious lo mein as well.  Also, all of the dishes come with steamed rice, so you don't have to order it separately.  Cheap, fast, hot, super tasty.",

After checking out the menu, I placed our order and within 35 minutes it was at her door!  We ordered the sweet & sour chicken & pepper beef lunch combos and an order of crab angels (aka crab rangoons).   I have to say this was some the best Chinese food I have found in the valley. The pepper beef was cooked perfectly and full of peppers & beef. My daughter also loved her sweet and sour chicken.  Beijing Express was a great find on Eat24!",

Today i came here and ate in for the first time as i was having my car stereo installed near by.  It was good fast service. Only thing i can critique about the food is that the fries rice has to be better.  Anyways this place is a solid 4 when it comes to chinese restaurants in AZ but would be like a 2 if compared to a lot of hole in the wall chinese restaurants in LA.",

Delivery is quick, but I live close by and sometimes opt to go pick up the order so I can eat quicker! Don't forget the handful of fortune cookies that makes Chinese take-out complete.

I was a little nervous as there were no online reviews at that time but we were pleasantly surprised. I had the moo goo guy pai which was really good and my fiancee had the orange chicken which was good but a little bland.  I ordered white rice but the accidentally put pork fried in with the meal but realizing the mistake also included a side if white rice. I did end up eating a bit of both rices which were both good....esp the pork fried.  The crab angels where my favorite part....they are delish.  As beijing express is just down the riad from us I think this will be our new go to Chinese place as long as the quality stays the same.",

We ordered online around 5:30 pm and they delivered within 15 min. 15 MINUTES! The food was packed perfectly and carefully and neatly. Egg rolls were perfectly fried and tasty, sweet and sour chicken was light and crispy, mixed veggies was a good variety and sauce was great, fried rice , steamed rice fluffy, egg drop soup good and hot and sour soup . I haven't liked the hot and sour soup at any of the other places I tried. Good job Bejing Express! You are my new go to for Chinese delivery!",

    "text": "Wow!  Dare I say I've experience the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona.  The best! In my experience with Chinese restaurants in AZ is, the food is almost ALWAYS old.  They normally cook it earlier then throw it right into the fryer when you order. You can tell.  You can taste the old grease.  This is NOT the case with Beijing Express.  I dined in.  I ordered the Wonton Soup and the Sesame Chicken Combo.  Within minutes (probably less than 3). I was served my Wonton Soup.   It was pippin' hot and absolutely delicious.  My goodness!  I'm not sure what kind of crispy noodle chips things that comes with the Wonton Soup but that are so good.  I tried taking a few bites of the Sesame Chicken but it was too hot to handle :)  Once everything cooled off I took a few bites and fell in love.  It was so hot and fresh!  The portions were huge.  I had enough for lunch the next day.  While I was dining, a woman came in speaking the same language as the people working there. She ordered a lot of food, hugged the pregnant woman behind the counter and left.  That made me feel good.  I'll definitely come back!",

The cashier quickly greeted us upon entering and she handed me over a menu and told us we could take a seat wherever.   We looked over their lunch menu and everything was under $10. Any plate came with rice (fried rice, white rice, and brown rice) and a spring roll.   We ended up ordering a large won ton soup, one plate of mognolian beef, one chicken teriyaki plate, and one shrimp with lobster sauce plate. Oh and three canned sodas for $1 each. My total came out to be close to $27.   Our won ton soup came out right away and it was delicious! The broth was sooooo good! Our food came out right after and everything smelled and looked so yummy.   The mognolian beef was a tad bit spicy (yumm) and it had such great flavor! The shrimp with lobster sauce was my favorite and it tasted even better along with the steamed white rice. The chicken teriyaki wasnt too sweet so it was delicious. Everything was very good!!!   If your craving good Chinese food come here! We enjoyed it and will be back if in the area",

Growing up on the East coast, there is an abundance of Americanized Chinese food that is amazing! Moving to Arizona, it was tough to find one of my favorite foods to eat until I found this place.   Beijing Express is fast, low prices and the entire restaurant is clean. We usually only order our food to go from here but every time we have been, we are always blow away with how clean the kitchen and everything is. So if you want quick Chinese food on the go, this place is ten times better than any Panda Express you will go to.  Top food picks would have to be the Crab Angels, Steamed Dumplings, Lemon Chicken and their Sesame Chicken. Everything is always piping hot when we get it and pretty tasty.",

Should have figured no from the start of the delivery boy not bringing change- thankfully between my hubby and I we had enough and little more for the tip but it decreased his tip amount (but I wasn't about to tip $12 on a $28 order). The egg roll was just cabbage filled not much more to it. The angel crab ragoons were ok but slightly undercooked and didn't have much filling.  Sad to say the egg drop soup was the best thing- it needed salt and didn't have much crunchy treats for it.  My Hubbies chicken fried rice was bland and he only ate a few bites.  My general tao's chicken wasn't good at all :( I ordered it medium but there was no spice to it at all- it was very sweet with lots of soggy breaking :(",

Delivery after ordering off of GrubHub was prompt and on time, and the sweet and sour chicken was not bad at all, neither was the egg roll. However , the hot and sour soup was disturbing, slimy, and cold, and the 3 fried cracker things had a hair in them, a nice long one. The fried rice and lo mein were boring. I'm mostly wishing right now I could take back my order. Will not be going back.",

The beef and broccoli has a really non over powering sauce, not too much sauce and not too little. Perfect amount. The broccoli is fresh and crisp and not soggy at all. The egg rolls and crab Angels (rangoon) were perfectly fried and not soggy and they even gave us an extra one. Rice was excellent as well as sweet and sour chicken. This place is GREAT!!! I highly recommend it and it will be our go to spot for all Chinese cravings.   Ps - the price is awesome too!",

It was somewhat spooky that nobody was dining-in, but I saw the cashier preparing a few carry out orders so at least I had the comfort of knowing I was not alone.  Beijing really nailed my order, and I was in and out within 5 minutes. Express indeed. The chow fun was served piping hot and truly made to order. I asked for things to be extra spicy and it came out at spice level of about a 7/10 just right for me. The flat noodles were both tender and plentiful. Beef was also generously applied thinly sliced and not overcooked. The support cast of onions and cabbage added to the delicious dish.  Pretty hyped that I found a new non-corporate Chinese spot. Will be back to try a few of their discounted lunch specials. Prices are just right.",

It's standard Americanized Chinese fare, so the menu is familiar if you've ever had Chinese before. I read some complaints about the minimum delivery charge and service, but I've never had poor service as it's merely delivery food so am unsure what folks are expecting in terms of service when it's just food being dropped at your door. Also, without a minimum fee people would abuse the takeout for small orders that would be counter productive to any revenue model. That said, it's fast and tasty Chinese food.",

No super greasy, overcooked food that tastes like oil and salt.  The dishes have a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked.   The first time, my partner and I shared broccoli beef and cashew chicken with an order of pot-stickers.  Even after being in the take-out box, the broccoli was crisp and green.  We both thought the dumplings were hand-made and he loved them. The leftovers lasted us two more meals.   Last night, my friend and I ordered takeout. We shared the kung pao chicken, an order of crab angels, and egg drop soup.  Great prices, and again, still leftovers! My only complaint is that there wasn't more filling in the crab angels.    Great food for a good value.",

I had the Szechuan Beef and my husband has the Dragon and Phoenix and fried dumplings.  It was all very delicious and hot.  The only downside was we wanted spicy and it appeared to be quite mild, but still very good.  I would definitely recommend Beijing Express when you are craving takeout.",

    "text": "At the time of this writing I am 6 months pregnant.  Full disclosure.  I was previously a huge fan of Golden Eggroll, and their food is still decent, but one day I was browsing through GrubHub and found Beijing Express.  We ordered your staples:  Sweet and sour chicken - FRESH!  The chicken is freshly fried and the sweet and sour sauce is delicious.  Beef or Chicken lo mein - my husband loves the noodles and says they are delicious.   Egg rolls - Hot, flavorful, and they always add those little packets of spicy mustard that complement the egg rolls perfectly.  Egg Drop Soup - Just egg and broth and absolutely delicious!  Crab Angels - I know, this order is starting to be a little cliche, but these are my guilty pleasure.  Again, freshly fried and delicious.  They deliver quickly, the food is always piping hot, and the quality of their ingredients cannot be beat by any other delivery Chinese establishment I have tried in Tempe.  If I have to choose between Golden Eggroll and Beijing Express, I'm going Beijing all the way!",

    "text": "Delicious! The food came early and was super hot still! We ordered fried wontons, crab angels, wonton soup, egg drop soup and almond chicken.  Expected the standard food in cardboard boxes and lukewarm at best. What we got was in plastic containers, super hot, and delivered ahead of schedule!!! Thoroughly impressed to say the least.  Everything was delicious. The soup had flavor. They included the extra spices I asked for. The fillings on the wontons and crab angels were all flavorful as well (and real meat in the wontons, not just fried wraps!).  It was so good, that I just ordered from here again tonite!",

    "text": "As soon as I called in my order, I became obsessed!! The customer service was amazing. They were courteous and friendly, which mean everything to me! I was told my order would be ready in 10 minutes, I got there in 7, and my food was ready!!  The place was very clean and smelled clean, which is also a plus for me. I loved the open kitchen area, which allows an OCD person like myself to check out everything that is going on. But nonetheless, I ordered Tofu and Broccoli with garlic sauce!! It was sooooo good! Everything  was cooked perfect, especially the tofu..I love fried, firm tofu and they delivered!! The garlic sauce was good....a little sweet for my liking, but still good. And for $6.95, I was able to get leftovers popping!!! I am happy...the end",

    "text": "If I could review with ZERO stars I would..first the food is sub part. My General Tso chicken is mushy and lacks any flavor. House Fried rice was greasy and had almost no meats. The chow mein is disgusting literally there is 7 pieces of chicken.  I counted.    Now that brings me to the pathetic customer service. Ordered chow mein..where I usually order from it is noodles. So I call back explain I'm here at a hotel my food is soggy and the chicken isn't in noodles... he says well that's the chow mein many people make that mistake.  I offer to pay if they can just bring it please. Mind you I just spent $35 and tipped driver  $4. The guy says minimum delivery is $15!!!!!! I said I just ordered he said oh well you order wrong thing minimum $15. I told him that fine I'll order 2 , now I have to pay ANOTHER delivery fee. I informed him this was horrible customer service and he said . ok literally he said ok. So needless to say NEVER ORDER FROM THEM. YOUR MONEY IS NOT APPRECIATED and they're completely flippant about customer service.",

Get it to-go. Go eat on a park bench. Or on your couch in front of Netflix. Anywhere but here. It was about 90 degrees inside the restaurant and the atmosphere was like a cafeteria. We were all drenched with sweat when we left.",
