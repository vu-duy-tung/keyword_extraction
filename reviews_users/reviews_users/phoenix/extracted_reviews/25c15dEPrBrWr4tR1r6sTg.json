I wasn't greeted upon entering; had to wave down a waitress for me to sit down and once I got seated...I sat there for about 10mins b4 anyone asked if I was ready to order.  Once they took my order, 20 mins passed and no Bon Chan nothing. I had to ask for water and that was it. Another 10 mins passed and the waitresses just pass me and say nothing.   People who came in after me already had their drinks and Bon Chan and there I am...still waiting and nothing on my table.  From there, I said screw it and walked out. They lost my business and will never get it!  Never going here again!",

    "text": "First of all I want to say that we are never eating here again. My friends and I just finished eating at this restaurant and I am so PISSED OFF right now. Before you consider eating at this restaurant, read this post first.  The service is absolutely horrible. At first I thought it was OK but then when we needed to go because we were in a hurry but then our waitress just did not want to assist us at all. OK I get it, more customers have arrive but she was obviously avoiding us, even after making eye contact, not once but twice! I get that you are busy but at least have the courtesy to say you're sorry and will help us in a moment. But no! You tell us to fuck off by walking away! By the time we got our check about 15 minutes have passed already. And we even had to request several times for a to-go box and still forgot it when we got our check. Because of the unsatisfactory service I decide to give a low tip to let them know that we were unhappy.  But even after all of that has happened...and the soggy sushi...we would have still been willing to give them a second chance because we love Japanese and Korean food. But then as I was backing up in my car the same waitress decides to bang on my window then demand that I erase the tip I gave her and said she \"does not accept low tips.\" Talk about UNPROFESSIONAL! A tip is still a tip. And is based on the quality of your service.  All I can is we will never again eat here and I will be making sure my friends and family stay away from this place so that they will be saved from the bad experience that we had.  The owner needs to seriously start thinking about changing or fixing his/her staff, or this business is definitely going down.",

I've heard that the service is what stinks, really (which is what prevents it from getting solid stars)... but during my time there, it didn't feel like we were served poorly. Obviously we didn't feel as if we were tended to hand and foot with gracious, loving attention - but we were served, in a timely manner, and we didn't feel unwelcome or confused.  Perhaps it depends on the waitress? Or perhaps they've improved since then.  The food was great, definitely tasty. I'm sure I don't need to get into detail about their foods, as all the others here described them well enough. There's not much I could add to them.  The only thing that really prevents this from getting five stars is... Well, frankly, I've had /better/ Korean food elsewhere (outside of AZ). Quality of ingredients and what-not. This is by no means terrible, and it isn't sub-par, and hardly is it average. It's great! But it isn't BESTTHINGINTHEWORLD-status. Added with the okay service, the decent parking, the exceptional cleanliness: the max I can give this is 4-stars.  If you're in AZ and want darn good Korean BBQ. Come here.",

(We didn't do that this time... but I do plan to return.)   We ordered the Las Vegas roll, which I've had better versions of elsewhere, but it was still delicious. My partner ordered the vegetable roll and the cucumber roll because she is vegetarian. They were a bit bland to me, so I wish they had more vegetarian options, but maybe Korean/sushi is not the best option for vegetarian meal options.   I also wish they had a better beer selection. It was fine, but nothing special.",

    "text": "Amazing place!  I'm new to the world of Korean food and sought this place out due to YELP reviewers.  I've had the Seafood bibimap that comes served in a heavy, stone bowl. i had read online what to order and it didn't disappoint. A word of caution - don't dig in right away. Wait a few minutes to allow the rice that's at the bottom of the bowl to continue cooking and become crispy. Yum! Also, the bowl keeps a high temperature so be careful you don't burn your fingers or arms when reaching to try the tasty side dishes.  My companions ordered kimchi soup (spicy is too mild a word) that was pretty flavorful but it's hard to taste food when you're tearing up and your nose is running, right? Note to self: don't ever do that again!  We've tried the barbecue where it's cooked directly at our table and the waitress demonstrated how to assemble everything. Try the sirloin and the shrimp BBQ, both are fantastic!  I mentioned earlier the side dishes which change each time, but still delicious. I had never tried kimchee before this place and I'm glad I tried it because I love it!  Each time we've returned the service has been great. We weren't in a rush to eat so didn't mind the wait time for the food.",

I love korean food and have to go back. But can someone tell me why bulgogi is so expensive? $17-something... really? Why? Just bumms me out because its one of my favorite dishes. Anyway, two different ladies were serving at our table. One of them was super nice and helpful, but the other one was kind of grumpy, to say the least.  There are some other sushi places in the area with great happy hours they are competing against and this experience was only worth 3 stars to me in comparison. Maybe the expensive bulgogi will blow my mind. I guess I have to go and find out.",

This was my brothers first time trying Korean food and he enjoyed it but was quite surprised to see that you cook your own bbq.  I am always pleased with the serving sizes they have and also with the side dishes they offer.  The last few times I went they would refill our side dishes pretty quickly and would ask us if we wanted them refilled as they walked around, this time however they didn't ask once about refilling and I honestly didn't ask myself since we were getting full but there were a couple of side dishes I wanted more of.  When we went it was a very busy night we waited around 20 minutes to be able to get a table and realized while waiting that you can call ahead and reserve a table so I'll probably end up doing that next time we go.",

Being the first time in we had barely cracked the menu and tried to tell her no, we weren't familiar with the menu or food and needed help. All she heard was no and walked away. 15 minutes later no one had come back and we walked out.   Really really disappointed with this place. Most places take the time to ask if you've ever been in and help out, regardless of cuisine. We definitely won't be back, and we can't recommend it to anyone either.

My wife and I visit once a week to watch the games during happy hour and we tend to eat our dinner after we've indulged in some sushi, soup and drinks. The service is very homely because the owner and staff take an interest and remember your name. You're greeted on your way in and out.    Lastly, the popularity of this restaurant amongst locals will make it hard to get a seat so make sure that you call ahead and ask for a reservation because some nights they have a line out the door.",

    "text": "First time visiting this location. Loved it! We ordered the table top bbq beef and chicken bulgogi. The meats were seasoned perfectly. The meats were lean (like I like them). We received the standard array of sides: rice, kimchi, pickled cucumber, bean paste, sprouts, etc. We also received lettuce to make lettuce wraps. The servers were very nice and attentive. We promptly received refills on drinks and sides without needing to ask.   On a side note- the ladies working were impressed and giddy that our 6 year old loves kimchi.    We'll be returning soon!",

However, our friends have ate here previously and they helped us with ordering our food.  Our appetizers were fried dumplings, Tempura shrimp, and Taka Set Sushi. My son ordered the Vegetable Yakisoba and we ordered the Kalibi Dolsot Bibim Bap (Marinated Rib Meat served with vegetables over hot sizzling rice in a stone bowl).  Our waitress brought out a series of pickled vegetables that was very good as well. The food was fresh and prepared well. We had a very nice waitress who was attentive and quick. There were 6 of us in the group, so she was busy bringing out a variety of carefully prepared dishes that we ordered. We ended our meal with a ice cream dessert for our friend's birthday. I recommend ordering the hot tea, its very good. They have offer both Korean BBQ and Japanese dishes.  We will return in the future. TIP: If you come in before 7:00 pm, the appetizers are half off.",

In comparison to the other Korean places that I've tried here in Arizona this place has the most authentic sides! I liked all the sides except the daikon. The daikon has a perfume like after taste. I order the rib meat bibimbap. It came out in a big stone bowl, which was filled with more rice than the veggies and meat.. The meat was marinated well, juicy and tasty! I probably won't order the bibimbap again, personally it tasted a little bland... One of my friends order the mandoo dumpling which was delicious! My other friend order the rice cake dumpling soup, the broth was flavorful! The staff was kind and friendly! We came in a Tuesday night, customers started picking up around 8pm. The only downfall I'd have to say is, it's not an all you can eat Korean BBQ! :(",

    "text": "I am third generation Korean born in Hawaii and miss real good Korean food.  I was used to Cho Dang in Chandler where my favorite was the Bhi Pam Pap (Korean Fried Rice) in the hot stone bowl and the little dishes of kim chee but was severely disappointed with Takamatsu on Dunlap in PHX when I order the same thing.  Hardly any meat, chopped lettuce filler was used and the stone bowl was not HOT enough to scorch the rice on the bottom.  I didn't know of any other Korean restaurant to go to near me in PHX so went again when I was hungry for kal bi ribs, I paid unknowingly $26.95 for the dinner portion so I could get the little dishes of kim chee and I got around 5-6 little band aid size pieces of meat over onions with 2 very large bones that had little or no meat to pick off, and the stone platter WAS NOT sizzling.  They don't take the extra measure of getting it right, will not go there again, googled PHX Korean restaurants and found another on on West Olive Avenue Cafe Ga Hyang near Takamatsu, just returned, food great but service was so SLOOOOWWWWW!  When I asked for a refill on the kim chee dishes she said they don't refill and reluctantly did so for just 2 kim chee's. But the stone bowl was SIZZLING HOT and the rice scorched and lots of BBQ meat, the best yet is Kim Chee Time in Tucson, they have a killer Bhi Pam Pab with a special mixture of rices that is to die for which gets so crispy it's insane and no problem refilling kim chee pun cheon little dishes.  If anyone knows of anywhere else to try for good Korean food in PHX pleas let me know.",

It is a Korean BBQ restaurant which also has 9 or so Japanese dinners, and a rather limited sushi menu.  Hubs and I had a Royal California Roll ($5) which is a deep fried CA roll, a Crunch Roll ($8.50):  shrimp tempura, cuke, avocado, crab salad and tempura batter outside; a spicy tuna roll ($5)  an eel roll. ($6.50), and saba nigiri sushi ($3.50)  The rolls are all average size, and were quite tasty.  Better than Sushi Koi and Mr. Sushi.  Finding decent sushi on the west side, south of Thunderbird, is almost a miracle!  My husband had the spicy tuna roll, and said the tuna was minced, and he wasn't too crazy about that, but really enjoyed everything else, as did I.  The crunch roll was warm all the way through which was nice.  The saba had a good flavor.  The waitstaff are all very friendly; English is a challenge for some, and we felt our server was somewhat inattentive, but someone else took over.  Not outstanding, but hit the spot quite nicely.  On the west side, beggars can't be choosers.  We will definitely return to Takamatsu.",

Apparently Korean food hasn't really caught on yet here. Went on a Sunday night, completely crowded but I was still impressed with the speed of service. If you want to find a real hole in the wall, authentic asian place this is it. The strip mall is all asian owned businesses. Anyway they had 2 sections for the menu, one with a few Japanese dishes, sushi, udon etc and the other completely Korean, I wanted Korean barbecue but my boy wanted something else.....Loved the food, except my boy, he thought his Chicken Teriyaki was a bit grisly even though it was served in an iron skillet plate. They also brought out about 7 dishes of what looked like small sides of pickled vegies etc...very good....The gyoza was awful and not the Japanese kind, but rather the more crispy, oily Chinese kind. Anyway I finally found my little slice of Asian food in the west valley. BTW finally went with my brother, visiting from Denver, and we had Korean BBQ, you cook it right there on the grill and they bring all the little plates of Korean Pickles and Kimchi--OMG it was so good. My brother says it was the best food he'd had in a long time! They also serve Sochu along with Sake and other Japanese Beer.",

I think I prefer the one in Tucson because of their all-u-can-eat special but all and all it was a fairly good experience.",

    "text": "Things have changed at this restaurant.  What a disappointment. This restaurant has been in business for many years with authentic Korean food with outstanding service. Still the food is fair. However the way the food is served was terrible, especially with barbecue.  We have waited around 20 minutes for the side dishes are served and barbecue came about 45 minutes later even after our noodles and rices. Servers were not helping us barbecue and anything that we have asked to servers has been re-asked and delayed. No wonder there are not many Koreans. Role of servers is extremely important  for  Korean dishes, especially if it is for a barbecue. Even though it's foods are still fair, the way the food is prepared and served is a total disaster and I would not call this authentic Korean. If you are satisfied with this restaurant, you will be amazed with how the authentic Korean foods are prepared and served in Korea or even in Southern California.   A definite thumbs down!  Try somewhere else for Korean foods.",

We ordered a shrimp, chicken, and beef dish (I believe #22, 23, and 28) to try a good mix of everything. The food  came with a great deal of veggies and sides so we did not need any sushi or appetizers at all. The food was pretty good. The beef and chicken had a lot of flavor but the shrimp was a little lacking. It was fun to cook the food on our own table grill! The staff was friendly and brought everything quickly. My friend had her baby with her and the place was very baby friendly. The final bill for four people was $52.00 and we were all stuffed which was a very reasonable price. The decor left something to the imagination but overall we enjoyed it and I would go back.",

I have been to the Dunlap location at least 3 times, simply because it was close and my hubby doesn't eat a lot of sushi.  So, what we usually do is I order sushi and he orders the teriyaki.  The sushi I do have to admit it, is not worth the money at all.  I ordered sushi from the place mat menu and since it doesn't list prices, I thought it would be more reasonable than $12.00 for the small amount of fish that was in my sushi.  I was ok with this place until I went there with a friend who was familiar with their Korean menu.  We wanted to cook the pork ribs ourselves, but the lady said that we had to order two orders, so we didn't.  I had such a great experience doing to cooking at the Chandler Takamatsu that I thought it would be fun again, but oh well.  The ribs came out and it was chewy and the portion for the one order was a lot smaller than the Chandler location.  Even the Tucson Takamatsu had better sushi and food.  I just don't get it about this location?",

I never ever eat sushi at a place when their sushi bar is smaller than my table. An exaggeration of course, but just an observation I've made in many of my sushi bar experiences.  The portions for the cook it yourself KBBQ is pretty generous. I've had the neung myun and its refreshing on a summer day. All the meats I've had here are pretty well marinated and juicy. Bulgolgi, kalbi ribs, the chicken and pork. Yum! The waitresses are cute and accommodating, just ask and they'll see what they can do for you! The ban chan is pretty tasty too.  Wish it wasn't so far from where I live though, I'd go more often. But then I would be broke! So I guess it cancels out. I hope they stick around. Places are closing down like wild fire. :(",

Nothing can compare to Southern Cali Korean food but this place has been a favorite for the family. There are other places but this is the closest and never had anything bad. I love the table top grill and can never say I no to this place.   I don't know about the sushi here since I always known it for just the Korean food so I will just stick to that. Anyone wanting to try Korean food do it right and go all out here!!!  Another cool thing about this place is, during spring training there are a lot of Korean Baseball players in the majors, when they are in town they are known to frequent this place more than once a week, who knows they might even bring their teammates.",

LOL...shoyu is the Japanese word for what the Western world calls \"soy sauce.\"   Anyhow, I have tried both the Japanese and the Korean dishes here, and wasn't impressed with either of them.  Neither one is quite authentic.  They have this all you can eat sushi deal which is a total rip off.  You pay $21 and you order whatever you want, but the service is so slow to bring you your items that by the time you've waited so long, you're full already.  They also have this rule that you MUST EAT everything you order, even all the rice, or they will charge you full price for those items.  I wound up having to sneak off some sushi and toss it in the garbage in the bathroom for my friend who got in over his head.    The miso soup is terrible--tastes like it's from a package and they added too much water.  Sushi is average at best, nothing special.  It's very Americanized sushi.    Probably won't eat here again because the price doesn't match the quality of the food.  Service can be slow.",

    "text": "I went for an early dinner on a Saturday night. with two friends. There were only three other tables and two already had their food.  They asked if we wanted one of the BBQ tables, we said yes that is what we came for. Here is how the dinner progressed...  1) Asked for the sushi  menu and ordered iced tea.  2) 10 minutes passes (maybe more, I am feeling generous) and the drinks come. We handed her the sushi order and placed our BBQ order.  3) 5 minutes later we get our teas.  4) Maybe 20 minutes later (still being generous) and they bring out our BBQ order...COOKED!!!! and COLD!!!!! We said we wanted to cook our own. (We were sitting at the freaking BBQ table and...they asked us when they sat us!!) We get some comment that it was too hot inside. Now get this, the table that had just left next to us had cooked their own!!  5) Then they bring us the miso soup...luke warm at best. (Did I say there were only three other tables??  6) 15 minutes later they bring the sushi.  7) Absolutely-appalling-yuk-disgusting-gag-a-maggot. The rice was not sticky and the whole thing fell apart when put in the soy\\wasabi dip. The rice they served with the BBQ was stickier. I should have disassembled the sushi and made my own at the table using that rice. The nori was chewy, like the sushi had been sitting for too long. I spit most of it out into my napkin. I question the freshness of the tuna and scallops as well. I hope I do not get food poisoning.  8) The service was horrible. When I needed a refill, they never came. I was sucking on the straw loudly trying to get their attention. (yes, uncouth, but come on!!!) My buddy got so frustrated he got up grabbed our glasses and took them to their drink station to fill them up. The servers were on the other side of the partition eating and having a conversation.  I will NEVER eat at this worthless dump again.  They were lucky I left them a ten percent tip. I seriously thought of stiffing on the tip and in hindsight I should have.  Eat at this place at your own risk!!",

Food is definitely authentic and has the \"homemade\" taste. All the servers are all warm, loving Korean moms and and will always bring you more cold dishes. Everything is delicious and never an issue with food or the sushi. Yes, they do sushi too! My favorites are the bim bim bap, kalbi short ribs, and the spicy tofu soup. All of their cold dishes are really good too, best one are the spicy cucumbers. Seriously one of my favorite places in Phoenix!",

The first time we went during happy hour at around 630 we finally put our order in at 710.. happy hour ends at 7..we just forgot about it and paid regular prices and didn't say anything about it because it has been one our favorite restaurants near our house and family owned.. the type of business we go out of our way to support. The second time they had a fairly large sized group and pretty much said we couldn't order sushi. We wrote that off too as they did seem fairly busy.. so tonight we go there without the kids so we are in no hurry it took about 20 mins to be seated, no big deal. The party seated after us and right next to us had their drinks and food order in before they even brought us water. I will probably give this place another try maybe our luck will change and we can get the type of service we did every other time before the last 3 visits but we've thought that the previous two times we have been there. We just walked out tonight.",

Within an hour there was not an empty table in sight.  It was my first Korean BBQ experience and I enjoyed it.We sat at a table that did not have do it yourself BBQ because we didn't want to wait.  The meat was super tender and my friends said the kimchi was on point!  Service was a little gruff but attentive. Our drinks refilled and everything was fresh and tasty.  The decor is outdated and the neighborhood is on the sketch side but it didn't deter us from giving this place a try.  Next visit we will definitely try the BBQ table and get a little more adventurous with our menu choices.",

The menu is fairly extensive to include a lot of your favorites of each of the cuisines.  Tonight, I opted for all Korean food, granted they still offer complimentary Miso Soup with your meal along with the regular Korean side dishes they have created.  All of them were tasty and flavorful.  I ordered the Kim Chee Hot Pot rice bowl, which is similar to Fried rice and this one offers the egg on top.  However, the egg is fully cooked so, you don't get to mix the soft cooked yoke into the rice.  I also ordered the spicy sauteed chicken & vegetables which had a nice punch to it, which was very good.  All of the wait staff was friendly and courteous, that was a plus; considered the entire place was basically full except a few tables here and there.  They do offer the grill tables, if you want.  It's a great novelty thought, but I would always prefer their chef to cook; just a personal thing for me.  I would definitely come back again.",

I'm originally from the greater DC area, and we have a lot of amazing KBBQ there, which I miss a lot. My boyfriend took me to Takamatsu and now we're addicted. The staff is amazing - all the waiters and waitresses are very friendly and attentive. They make sure your glasses are always full, will tell you about the meats you're eating or strike up a small conversation. I always feel very welcomed there. In the 4 or so times we've been there, my boyfriend and I have had almost every meat on the Korean BBQ menu. The bulgolgi and corned beef are our favorites. I love all the side dishes as well. I HIGHLY recommend his place!",

I think I've tried almost all of the Korean dishes, including bbq and this place always delivers...I've taken countless friends and acquaintances here, and we've never had a bad experience, ever. Is it the best Korean food I've ever had? While I can't say that it has, as I've been to too many places in Southern CA and downtown LA/Koreatown that are superior, Takamatsu is probably the best place in AZ that I've personally been to. I guess technically, my review should be 4.5 stars, but since I can't seem to leave a half star review, I am rounding up for how well they've always treated me.  Some of my favs here include (please forgive the phonetic spelling) Kalbi Tang (regular and spicy), Sul Lung Tang, Kim chi jjigae, Daen jang jjigae, Kalbi dol sot bibim bap, Dduk mandu guk, Yuk gae jang, Nak ji bokkeum...all of the meats for the bbq including shrimp and squid, as well as some of the sushi offerings (spicy tuna!). This review is long overdue. Don't confuse this location with the one that used to be near Luke Air Force base, that one was just awful, and I see that that location has since closed, shocker. But this location is completely different and I would suggest that anyone who is curious about Korean food to check it out.",

We picked two different kinds of meat, the kalbi (shortribs) and the bacon, both were amazing. The sides that you get are great too! Such a wide variety of flavors. The staff was also very friendly, which is also great. They made some menu recommendations and also informed me that leaving chopsticks in my rice bowl is bad luck. (Good looking out!) Overall, a great experience as its pretty fun to cook your own food. We will definitely be back because I saw a bunch of other meals on the sirrounding tables that looked amazing and have also heard their sushi is fabulous as well!",

I had the bulgoki and brisket, however it was a small portion considering the medium to high price.The bulgoki was fantastic with a lot of flavor, but the brisket was very dry. I understand that the meat came with a sauce, but it was very bland and not very tasty. On a good note, the side dishes were good, and the meat was easy to cook. If I had to grade the service, I would say that it was alright, the food came fast (although it was un-cooked) but the lady serving me was a tad on the rude side.

I'll be honest, I don't love the sushi here, but the Korean dishes are very good. I used to live near Ktown in LA and have some experience with Korean food- I like the food here, it's good.  As for the Japanese dishes besides sushi that I have tried... they have been okay, but not my favorite.  I guess ultimately, I would give 3 starts for food- if they only served Korean food I would give 4 stars- However, since the service is always so friendly I think they deserve a solid 4 stars. Hospitality, smiling faces and politeness really add to and make an experience memorable. For that, they get my business... However, if I ever find a bug in my meal... everything will change!",

I've gone to this place several times, as it was introduced to me by my employer who is from China but lived in Korea for a few years. My husband ordered off the Korean menu and enjoyed his entree very much. We've yet to try the BBQ but will next time we go. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it doesn't have a very big dining area, so if you are going with a large group you may want to call ahead and make sure there is room. It also can be very loud in the restaurant but that isn't an issue for me (but may be for others). Their lunches are really good, in my opinion, so I would recommend going for lunch. I've been there for both lunch and dinner and both are good but lunches seem to be more value for your money.",

    "text": "Finally came back after a lackluster first impression, this time for KBBQ!  Things to know before hand: - A minimum order of two plates of meat will allow you to use the grill - Your clothes will smell after dining here - Probably one of the only places I know that does KBBQ in the Phoenix area  Decided to have a post-study dinner with a friend and what better way to nom away and replenish ourselves with good ole BBQ. We ended up ordering the pork belly and marinated rib eye or thinly sliced sirloin (bulgogi). It came with rice per person, side dishes (banchan), dipping sauces for the meats, onions, garlic, chili slices and even lettuce (sang chu). I was so happy to finally find a place that had KBBQ with all the appropriate accompaniments!   Good amount of food for two people to share, though I felt their side dishes were a bit underwhelming. I usually look forward to the Kim chi, bean sprouts, sliced fish cake and potato dishes but feel like their sides aren't top notch. Nonetheless, the bulgogi was marinated well and super flavorful and delicious. The pork belly was thick and cooked well, albeit being frozen. For those unsure how to have KBBQ, there's no wrong way ... though I usually have two strategies: eat the cooked meat with your rice and a bit of sauce/side dish to cut through the savoriness or add your cooked meat to your lettuce leaf, add garlic, chili slice, kimchi then wrap it all up and dip it in the soybean/chili paste! Absolute yum!  The service here is quick to clear things away and refills on waters. It's also a little drab on the interior and can smell musty at times, but the KBBQ totally makes up for it! For $15 or so a person, the price is alright ... it's no KBBQ like back in California where it's all-you-can-it, but it'll do for Arizona. It will do.",

The Japanese was the sushi while the Korean was the BBQ and entrees. I had sushi for lunch, so...  Between the three of us we ordered Pork Bulgolgi, Beef Kalbi, Bipimbap and two teas. The total came to $63 plus tip, which was a good deal.   There was plenty of food. The Bipimbap was okay. The meat was a bit sparse but it was tender and moist. The egg was over cooked too. The Bulgolgi and Kalbi were excellent. They each had tons of flavorful, juicy meat served on a sizzling platter and lots of sides like pickled kimchi, boiled and sauced potatoes, pickled sprouts, fish cakes, etc.   The Kalbi in particular was so tender you'd never know they were mostly collagen.   I recommend Takamatsu for a fast, inexpensive flavorful and authentic Korean dinner. Try the BBQ menu!",

We have seen this in many anime's like Naruto, and after research online, this is the only place who does something like it.    You must order two meals to use the grill, but the portion of food provided was well worth it. It was fun, fast, and very tasty. The restaurant isn't huge, maybe 20-40 tables but serve a combination of Korean and Japanese dishes.    A little expensive but not too bad if you share some plates in a big party.

I used to think their food was top notch but throughout the years, I feel like I have frequented far better korean barbecue places throughout the valley and in California. This place isn't bad by any means, but it's definitely not the best either.  The particular day we visited Takamatsu, the restaurant smelled fishy for some reason. The complimentary appetizers tasted okay. They give you a pretty decent amount. For korean barbecue, we usually order the Beef bulgoki which is always so good and tasty. We ordered the marinated squid as well which was just okay. Unfortunately, they don't give you a lot of seafood; you get a lot of vegetables with it. We got a few pieces of shrimp but the shrimp was marinated well. We ordered the kalbi and the seasoned ribeye and they were both okay too. I do wish they had a better dipping sauce on the side. We've ordered the sushi before, like the salmon nigiri and it wasn't anything memorable as expected.",

It was simply deep fried in a heavy oil that coated your mouth and not the tempura batter found in upscale restaurants. The soup was simply beef onion broth with soggy thick noodles. We were sorry after we got home that we ate the food at all. The service was good though and the eatery was sufficiently clean.",

I live in California where you can get cheap kbbq or get super expensive high quality kbbq. This place ranks way above average if it where to be competing in California.

The couple things that could be improved were service related. They gave us a little flack for not ordering more alcohol, and couldn't quite get the regular drink orders right. We asked for two ahi tuna rolls and one yellowfin roll along with a few other sushi. We ended up with three orders of ahi and extra ahi (that's a lot of ahi) on the plate with the other sushi and no yellowfin roll. They sent a few different people out to explain but never fixed it. We just ate what we got because we like ahi. Plus the sushi was all well made and delicious... so... it wasn't too horrible hahah  We asked a few times to have our sushi come before the food that we cook at the table.Overall they were nice and checked to see if we needed anything over and over. Our raw meat came before the sushi anyway. Then they insisted that we start cooking. Our sushi came about ten minutes later.  Overall though, it was a really fun experience. The food was excellent. All the little dishes of goodies (kimchi cucumbers, marinated fish cake slices, salt and pepper sesame dip... and so much more) really made the meal. We had an octopus salad appetizer that was one of the best of those I've ever had. The sushi was fresh and lovely. We had two types of beef to cook on the burner and they were both amazing. Even with its little quirks and communication errors, I highly recommend this place. It's an adventure for your mouth",

The portions are reasonably large and the side items are plentiful and delicious.  We always opt to cook table side at dinner time - it's a fun experience, which our kids also look forward to. At lunch, I usually order the regular Bibim Bap or the seafood Bibim Bap which is served in a hot stone bowl - where else are you going to get something like that? As far as \"atmosphere\" is concerned - well, there really is none. But, there is definitely no better Korean food in Phoenix.",

Their jap chae is good but a little sweet which I am not used too. I still order it though. I have had their hot pots (Dolsot Bibim Bap)  and they are all good... the bulgolgi and kalbe are good as well. My mom orders the broiled milk fish and she loves it. They have a great selection of kim-chee and give you more if you want some. I am always asking for this seasoned seaweed and seasoned fish cake.  The staff is good and always attentive. We go here soooo much that they know us.   They also serve sushi and sashimi. I order the Sashimi if I am really feeling hungry. The cuts of meet taste fairly fresh.... I am picky about my fish especially since the closet ocean is a couple hundred miles away. This place does a good job of it. The sushi rolls are decent. Nothing spectacular.... Their smaller than what I am used to but then again I come here for their Korean food not the Japanese food.   All in all the best Korean Restaurant I have been to since moving to the valley.",

Having just moved to the PHX area from SoCal, I was hardcore craving some Korean food. A few weeks back, I scoured yelp to find this place. I ordered the Kalbi tang to-go and was charged 15 dollars. I was a bit surprised at the price seeing as cost of living was so low here but happily paid while giving a tip to the lady working the front because I didn't know any better. I went home, opened up my mediocre soup and continued to stew. 15 dollars was a lot for the soup I got. Something didn't seem right. I went online and low and behold, the price wasn't right. I think the lady charged me extra because she thought she could and pocketed the difference. Horrible!!! So not a fan of shady practices and this place seems to take the cake. I really wish she hadn't done that though. I would have been an excellent customer seeing as choices for Korean food are limited in this area.",

We wanted both sushi and Korean BBQ so we sat at one of the grill tables.   We got the marinated thin sliced beef, sooooooooooooo good! We also got the chicken, which was all dark meat and I am a white meat only girl, so I was sad that I didn't get to eat any of it since that was what I ordered.   When you order Korean BBQ you get all these tiny little random side dishes, some were good, some were questionable. You also get a miso soup that is just all right.   The hubs and our friend got down on 4 different kinds of sushi, I'm not totally into it, so I didn't eat any, but they cleaned the plate and said it was awesome!   We paid $99 for 2 dishes of Korean BBQ, 4 different kinds of sushi, 3 large beers and two saki's. Not to bad if you ask me.",

The first time, had the kalbi which was pretty good - good flavor.  The second time, I had the rib eye was overcooked (even though I asked specifically for medium rare), flavorless, and completely bland.  I barely finished half the plate.  Also, there was no sear on the meat.  It was completely soggy becasue I only ordered one serving and they did not BBQ it on the table.   It looked like they threw it in a pan.   It was $17 and I was so disappointed.  I could barely eat it without the bean paste.",

Being former chefs, my parents like to cook the meat at the table. We have always gotten great-tasting, fresh meat everytime we come here. We typically order a plate of shrimp, and a plate of pork. We also start with a large plate of fresh sashimi too.   The service is pretty good, but we did have an issue with the manager one time. My brother left behind a memory card for his camera on the table in the restaurant. When we went back in to ask for it, he said he hadn't seen it - with a smirk on his face.  We still continue to eat here because there aren't too many choices around our house for good Korean food.",

    "text": "I swore I had already reviewed this place. But I must've been hallucinating (again.) I had stopped in here quite a while back, to pick up some sushi, gyoza, and seaweed salad to go. I was pretty unimpressed, and I remember thinking I'd give it two and a half stars.  However, I went back on Friday, and went for the full-on Korean BBQ experience -- a first for me. And I am so glad, I gave Takamatsu a second chance, especially where they can show off their star attraction.  I was a little early, and decided that while I was waiting for my dining companion, I'd sip a G&T. Bad idea.   First, I had to point out to the server which bottle on the bar was the gin. Then, I tried (and failed) to explain what tonic was. I got a gin and soda, no lime. I doctored it up with a sugar packet and the lemon wedge from my water, but ulgh.  Again, my bad for not playing to their strengths. I should've gotten a beer, or heck, a plain ol' shot of booze.  Since it was the first Korean BBQ experience for us, we decided to pick one thing we'd heard of and one that was kind of healthy. We went for the bu-go-ki beef and the shrimp.   Our server returned with about a dozen little dishes full of fixins, and placed a grate on the grill and turned it on. The dishes contained kim-chee, fish cakes, something spinachy, something bean sprouty, little minnow jerkies, bean paste, tofu, pickles, jalapenos, and garlic cloves. I may have forgotten a couple of things.  I don't know if we were getting the short shrift, or if our server assumed we were pros at this, because the process was not explained at all. Luckily, I'm a grilling fool, so I just dove right in and started cooking some meat. We also had to flag her down in order to ask what some of the things were as well.    In addition, when we were done with our beef, and were ready to move onto shrimp, she didn't change the grate. I didn't even know this was an option, until I saw a neighboring table have it done. I tend to think it was just shoddy service, since we waited ages for drink refills as well.  I don't want to say it was because we were some of the few non-Koreans there. I think it was more likely that it was because we were just a two top, and not doing mad shots of shoyu = less opportunity for a big tip. Either way, the service part of the experience kind of sucked.   Nonetheless, I'd readily come back -- maybe with a group.",

I ordered the dolsot bibimbap which is sizzling hot stone bowl filled with rice and topped with a nice medley of vegetables.  The key is to mix in the hot sauce and quickly mix everything together while the bowl still sizzles.  This was a major disappointment because there was just SO MUCH rice and so little veggies and the veggies that they did use were very uninspired.  They could have used some traditional korean greens but instead it was just the plain stuff...  I can easily make it better at home.  Also, the banchan was bad as well.   The marinated garlic stems were horrible and tasted way old...  so did the kimchi..  It's not worth the drive but if I'm in the neighborhood maybe I'll try it again one day.  I'm used to the great Korean food in LA so my standards could be too high, but I really think this place could put a little more effort into their food.",

The food was good, but definitely overpriced compared to LA or DC area Korean. The ban chan was great, as was the kimchi chigae.   The real problem was the service. They were friendly, but waaaay understaffed. As a result, we ended up having to cook our own meat, which is atypical. Also everything came out slowly.

Of course, I was also comparing it to it's sister location in the East valley which no Korean bbq location in the valley compares to.    Since I am stuck in the west valley I was limited to my korean bbq choices.  I have gone to locations where im ignored to areas where you are given rice by the grain count.  stingy.  I felt it fair to come back to this particular location despite reading the other warnings....still....I kept it in the back of my head.  I made sure my 5 and 3 year old daughters were as polite as possible and they were acting extra respectful and cute.  That got more attention that probably stole from other yelpers dining on this particular evening and hence see their review score drop.  I dont care...survival of the fittest you mongoloids....I was not to be devoid and robbed of good service and constant need of replenished side dishes and attention.  I came here to seek that for my only mission was to stuff my face with no letting up.   It worked.  The family was full, food was fantastic and service was great.  Reason for 4 and not 5*s? They charge a dollar for every side past the ones you've devoured already.  Since my girls were cuter than your kids and I was extra polite.....They didnt charge me for the extra sides.  sushi was also great.  I tipped good and thus did not encounter a crazy Korean waitress chase our minivan down for the gratuity.  Life is good.  Korean bbq makes it sooo much better.",

Edible, but a bit gummy tasting.  The lunch special is a pretty good deal - comes with a few cali rolls that are decent, a dumpling and a little bit of salad.

Food-wise: I ordered the Spicy Tofu Soup and my friend had the Bi Bim Pop.  They are both pretty much standard.  Both good.  I was very disappointed by their side dishes though.  It lacked selection and it didn't taste that fresh.    Bottom line: Coming from the Bay, we have a lot of great selection, especially authentic cuisines...so I guess I'm pretty spoiled here.  So for AZ standards, this place is not bad.  I would come back, but not sure about the sushi though.",

We've noticed little things here and there where corners have been cut, such as we no longer get a bowl of miso soup with dinners. The real problem is the decline of polite service here. There's a certain waitress who seems to run the place, screaming through the dining area and in the kitchen. Every time we go we cross our fingers that we won't get her as a server, but she's always there, dammit. She throws the food down then takes off before you can say anything so I end up having to go to the station and get utensils or drinks myself because she's in a daze of running and yelling. Last time we went, she and the male manager were screaming at each other across a crowded dining area, with the man stopping directly behind my chair and screaming into the back of my head.

I was in a party of 3 and my bill came out to $80 and we'd had no alcohol. They also don't really have a spicy option. Sriracha is what they use to spice it up.",

I have eaten that particular entree four times!! I would like to try other items on the menu next time.   The only thing I don't like is the location. It's too far from house. I only go there to eat, if I have to drop off my husband at work. Other than that, I love this place!!",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Takamatsu since 1998. This restaurant was one of my first reviews when I started Yelp but guess it disappeared since it was so long ago. It's been a couple years since our last visit, and went for dinner on a Saturday night, in early February. Thankfully, there were some open tables, despite the large party in the back room and busy dining room. We took a grill table booth. Be careful of the gas lines and metal under the table. It reduces leg room, but the four of us managed to fit. We intended to order two grill items to grill at our table but decided to amend our order once we got an eye-full of the menu. To use the grill, you must order two items. Since we only ordered one, they cooked it in back, which I was fine with too.   We started with the Hamul pajun (seafood pancake), no jalapenos, unless you can handle that level of spicy. It's huge and very intense if you get it with jalapenos. We also had an order of Jap chae. For the main course I had the amazing Galbi (or Kalbi) with lettuce, garlic and fermented bean paste. My hubs had teriyaki sirloin. With the delicious banchan and hot sake, it was a decadent meal.   Service was fast and super efficient. The ladies are the same ones from 20 years ago. I am sure they don't remember me but they always recognize me 7'1\" stepfather when we walk in. I introduced my mom to Takamastu and she loves it just as much as we do. My stepdad used to travel to Korea, Singapore, and the islands, for work and is happy to help me demolish a seafood pancake anytime I want to go, when we visit the Valley. Found memories built around great food and great dining experience.   They also have a great sushi menu but we opt to save our stomach capacity for the other great menu items. So.Much.Food!  Definitely a family place or casual date night.",

    "text": "Cook rib-eye traditional style at Takamatsu! My son and I popped in to grab a bite. I had heard that they served Korean food and wanted to try their banchan or side dishes. I was surprised to find a grilling table.   Tip: Minimum of 2 orders of barbecue to grill the meat yourself. So we ordered two orders of bulgogi or thinly sliced rib-eye steak. ($16.75 per order)  Banchan: Napa cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, fishcake with jalapeno, thinly julienne pickled radish, radish kimchi, greens, seasoned potato.  When you grill bulgogi, season the grill with the raw onion and the garlic. Then, I usually spread pieces of mean on top of the onion and garlic. I like cooking it on a little higher heat to get that nice char. You can eat the cooked meat wrapped with green lettuce. I suggest adding a bit of gochujang sauce, napa cabbage kimchi or kimchi of choice, a piece of grilled onion or garlic. You can also eat your grilled meat with rice and other kimchi.  My son and I enjoyed our meal very much. Our servers were very friendly. They were quick in filling our water glasses, and they were hospitable when we asked for more banchan as we devoured the tasty side dishes.",

There's always a strong family vibe when you walk in this place which makes it a comfortable environment to eat in. Therefore, encountering the staff whenever I come always makes my day and I'm thankful for that!      Secondly, the food here is AMAZING. It never fails me whenever I'm craving Korean and/or Japanese food. I highly recommend those to try the Royal California Roll as well as their Bulgogi or Daeji Bulgogi! It's hands down the best you'll find in Az. Personally, I've been to many kbqq places in Arizona and California but Takamatsu is always #1 on the list! I'd give them a 20/20 if I could so good job and keep up the good work! p.s. love the owner, he's just as amazing",

    "text": "So far, so GOOD! After I was wronged by Seoul Korean Grill, I tried to find another Korean place, failed! Then I turned around to go to Wendy's and it was like the Gods had shone upon me. A Korean restaurant? Right in front of my face? I took directions to another on yelp and it took me back to Seoul! It must have shut down. The tragedy!  So here I am, It looks like a dive bar from the outside and I mosey inside and the waiter is all class! Great sense of humor. Ask for Kyle, he's a swell guy!!!  I'm like starving, and the bimibap arrives in no time! It's great, but a fried egg? Not for me! I was brought out a raw one in seconds with no charge. The tender rib meat was amazing. Mmm... I'll be back.",

The people here and really nice and try there hardest to bring happy service, I like how the waitresses act like aunties and are always glad to help with food advice or bringing something to us. When I go I always use the stove top booths cause its more fun to cook and chat with friends plus this is the only best stove top Korean BBQ I been to. The price on some stuff is a little more pricey but it comes with a lot, such as side dishes and the main is a ton. So you defiantly get your monies worth.  Down sides would be the parking lot very small and private lot so it's like first come first serve. And if there is a full house you might have to wait a little longer to be served but they do good at making sure everything is taken care of.  This place is amazing.",

    "text": "Overall, I had a very unpleasant experience. I decided to check this place out because \"Cafe Ga Hyang\", which I was planning to go to, is now closed on Mondays.  When I walked in the restaurant, I was greeted by the sushi bar chef, but had no idea if I should seat myself or wait for someone. The restaurant was almost completely empty...there was only one other person dining in. Eventually a lady walked over and sat me down at a table with a menu. Then, the waiting begins...  Within a minute, I already knew what I was going to order, but unfortunately for me, the waitress had her back completely against me and was socializing with another waitress. They were chatting it up, laughing, and having a great time, while I was sitting there trying to get the other waitress' attention. At some point, the phone rang, and she walked over to the sushi bar area to pick up. I somehow thought that she would finally come over after the phone call, but instead she walked back to the other waitress to continue her exciting conversation.   I couldn't take it anymore and walked up to both of them and gave her my order. She did say \"sorry\", but I was still appalled at how unprofessional they were.  I ordered kalbi tang, which is something I usually get when I go to korean restaurants. It was overly salty and peppery and tasted like they added fish-flavoring to the broth. The beef was also tough. The banchan (side dishes) tasted very old; the kimchi was really weird. At korean restaurants, I usually ask for more side dishes, but in this case, I couldn't finish any of it. The best thing on the table was the white rice that came with the kalbi tang. I will not be back!",

Now I know why they offered the bbq each time, it was just amazingly delicious!! My friend and I shared short ribs and tenderloin with onions. Sides included were kimchi, potatoes,  bean sprouts, spinach, pickled radish, rice and my favorite fish cakes. It was all phenomenal. I had a lot of questions about all the dishes since this was my first time eating Korean. The servers were knowledgeable about each dish, the ingredients and how they were prepared. Being from NY where you could spent four hours at a table, it was refreshing that the servers didn't give in to Arizona's love of rushing through a meal. It was a great experience, I'll be back for more. Oh, side note, I removed a star because they had no desserts.",

The place felt a tinge divey, but the service was really quick and my order was accurate. I arrived early (5.15p), but by 6.30p, the place was packed with a mix of people. I ordered the stone pot bibimbap and added a lot of the red pepper sauce. The order also came with the traditional pickled radishes, seaweed, kimchee, pepper-lemon chicken, etc which were all very tasty. The loss of a star? A combination of cleanliness and price point on the bibimbap ($14). Though a huge portion, I thought it would be better around $12.50, which is what I pay for the same size in Boston. Overall: Tasty and easy to access.",

I had a lunch menu which had none of the grill options on it and I think there is yet another menu for the sushi bar.  Directly behind me I could hear a grill being used and saw a couple of carts of food go past me to the table.  Would have been nice to see how all the food was used but I probably would have watched closely enough to intrude on their meal.  I ordered a sliced beef lunch box ($8.95) and an iced tea ($1.25).  First up was a cloudy bowl of soup with green onions in it, pretty tasty.  After a while lunch arrived in a compartmented  tray.  Front and center was the beef, several gristly pieces.  Off to the near left were some pickled veggies and in the far left were, I think, 3 slices of California roll, a piece of apple, some sort of deep fried thingy and some ginger?  In the far right was sticky rice and in the very center was some Wasabi.  And in the near right was I think a couple of different kinds of bean sprouts, some sort of green leafy veggie and some sort of cake thing.  Even though I couldn't identify most of it I ate it all.  Obviously it didn't taste bad or I would have ignored some of it.  The service was ok but not friendly like it was with the regulars.  I would have liked to ask some questions about what was on my plate but got the Big Box store lack of eye contact with every employee that walked past.  Oddly, when they brought my entree they did not take away my empty soup bowl.  I noticed they did that at all of the tables, only busing once.  It looks like the back section of the dining room could be partially closed off for a group.  It was an ok experience.  I think I would rather go with somebody who knew the foods better.",

I tasted my friend's beef.   It was tasty as well, tasting similar to some of the stir fry dishes I prepare.

    "text": "I have a lot of affection for Takamatsu. Korean food is experiencing a surge of interest, and is likely to explode in the coming years with bulgogi being a popular introduction. But before Phoenix had a popular introduction to Korean food: there was Takamatsu. It's branded as a Japanese restaurant, because sushi was (and still is) a more popular cuisine in the valley. But the moment you open the menu, the real focus of the restaurant becomes clear, and the Korean conventions are confirmed after the banchan dishes are brought out. Bits of pickled garlic potato, kimchi, bean curd that had been made into a kind of pancake and then served in small slices -- they're all a little different in terms of texture, but all savory and interesting.  Sushi bar is decent, with quality nigiri. Their lunch combos are a good deal.   I'm used to bibimbap served in a hot stone bowl, such that it continues to cook the dish after serving and the edge of the rice gets crispy. The bibimbap here is instead served in a regular bowl that is not heated, so if you were counting on the rice having a crust: sorry. However, the ingredients are still quality and it remains an amazing deal.   Interior is usually quiet, except whatever lunchtime banter is happening at the sushi counter.  For dessert, I'm a fan of the green tea mochi.",

Now the restrooms smelled pretty bad, and they also need TLC and an upgrade.

Our waitress was very nice and funny and even gave us suggestions on what to try! The food was out fairly quick and you get a lot of food for what you pay so 10/10 would recommend!",

I've been to an extremely nicer BBQ places but I give them a double thumbs up for wonderful tasty authentic Korean dishes. I haven't tried their sushi but the menu looks great too. In one week I've been there 4 times and each time bringing a different friend. My favorite is Kalbi Dolsot Bibim Bap.  It's a bit pricy but they are always busy, friendly, and absolutely authentic soup dishes, etc. worth going casually or on a date to experience authentic Korean/Japanese food.",

We had to wait for for a bbq table which was fine but we were seated in a regular table and our orders were taken in advance (which was a good step to get our food on time when we made it to the bbq table) servers made sure our food was good and drinks were filled. Loved the Kirin beer of rose and as for food we got the Kalbi, bul go ki, and the deaji bul go ki.   All the fixings that came with the mains were delicious and we went ahead and ordered a sashimi dish as well which was heavenly.   One thing I'd like to mention was the ventilation, I don't think it was on, or it was but wasn't fast enough, as we left with all clothes smelling like bbq, but in my opinion it was worth it and will definitely come back.",

We have gone as a couple and sat at the bar and we have brought 5-7 family members ad used the BBQ tables. We have never ordered much alcohol and have gone and shared a small meal, they were very gracious and let us sit for a while and didn't rush us.   My favorite thing on the menu is the Sashimi Salad, it's really just a bowl of lettuce and raw fish and it's so delicious. The dressing is so amazing. If you want a BBQ table you often have to wait - it's a very popular place. It's worth the wait, and the server will help you select some nice meat options for your group. We recommend the Rib Eye.  I think the cost is very reasonable and we love Korean so this is one of about 15 different Korean restaurants we have visited in the last 3 years - across a few different states.  This is one of our top finds for yummy  and value.   Enjoy",

    "text": "We took our two roommates to dinner here the other night and it was one of the best experiences ever. There was a bit of the wait and the owner apologized many times and assured us a table was coming soon. He was very friendly and fun to talk to. While waiting, we watched the sushi chef and it was like watching an artist. The only word we could come up with to describe his crafting of the sushi was \"lovingly.\"   They quickly got us to our table and got our drinks. We ordered some meats for the BBQ table, an appetizer, kimchee chigae and some sushi. Everything was delicious. We eat a lot of sushi and frequent places in Little Tokyo in LA for sushi whenever we are there, and this was better. I honestly can't say I have ever had better sushi than here. All four of us were amazed and can't wait to go back for more. The meats for the BBQ were large portions and one plate of meat each was too much for us, but we ate until we were stuffed anyway. All of the sides that come with the Korean BBQ were great too, especially the pickled cucumbers and the kimchee.   The staff was wonderful as well. The sushi arrived fast despite the crowd, and the waitress did not treat us like we didn't know what we were doing. (I've had several experiences at other places where the wait staff watched us constantly as if we couldn't cook our own meats and one place where the waitress stood at our table and cooked it for us, never offering to let us do it, even though others were.) They were attentive with refills and the owner even stopped by as we were finishing up to joke with us and make conversation.   We were actually there a while after they \"closed\" since it was a busy Friday night, but they never rushed us or started to neglect us. Even as we were boxing things up to go, they stopped by asking if we needed anything else and was everything to our liking.  We can't wait to go back. This will probably be one of the places we hit every month or two because the service, the food, the atmosphere was all so great and the prices were amazing too.",

Unagi nigiri-surprisingly scorching when it arrived. It also tasted off, like it was old and reheated.   The '21 roll'-Standard tempura with eel sauce and spicy mayo that you can find anywhere. It has four or five different fish in it, but it's not like they really shine. Admittedly tasty.  007 roll-Avocado and shrimp on top, spicy krab filler. Nothing mind blowing. Very watery for a roll of its kind. Questionable.  Takamatsu charges decent sushi prices while delivering sushi that just ain't up to snuff. I promised myself not to review this place until I tried the Korean BBQ side that most people come for, but I can't wait that long. Friends don't let friends eat bad sushi.",

Grilling veggies that were marinating with the meats.   We also order a spicy soup, we asked them to make it \"medium\" - glad we did, it was just right - I've had my run in with Asian spicy soups in the past, and didn't feel like choking on my own tears that night.   We visited the Dairy Queen across the street  for desert, was cheaper -but don't worry we tipped very well, our waitress was incredibly kind, big smiles - offered recommendations and even made our soup \"medium\" despite not being traditional.

After walked in, no one was at the front desk to greet us. We waited for 10 min and the waitress are all walking around with no glance at us. We waited over 20 min after made the order and the waitress finally brought us the food. A huge BUG was found in the dish! A terribly huge bug! We asked them to come and take a look. They came and took the dish away with no apologies. It seems that they do not care at all! We got No Refill Water , No paper Napkins during the dining, actually they didn't even eye contacted with you or they just pretended to not see you. My friend had to stand up and found a napkin by herself!!! They rushed us to pay afterwards and I asked the old short Korean lady if she told the owner about the bug and she said yes. I asked her if I could speak with the owner plz and she seemed very nervous and asked me why. Then she ran to the owner and spent like 10 min talking and pointing at us. The owner finally came and smiled to us said what can I do for you. We told him about the bug and he said: oh, I know I know, that tiny little bug. We were so shocked and told him its not a teeny tiny but a pretty huge one. It seems he doesn't care either! I also noticed that that waitress was standing at the corner and staring at us , pointing at us, talked about us to other waitresses in an angry face...I can't believe that they treated customers like this! Seriously the service is the most unprofessional one among all restaurants! And you should always keep an eye on your food for bugs! We will definitely avoid backing to here again and I'm quite sure, if we came here, that waitress will spit into our food for sure because she's mean and hated us so much. I will make sure to report it to the local health department and Better business bureau.",

    "text": "Being this was our first time here, the wait staff was extremely unhelpful. When I asked the waitress what she recommended for some Korean BBQ she answered \"number 18,19,20,21,22,23,24\". Lol wtf?! Same thing when we asked for recommendations for a seafood plate which was very unhelpful.   We ended up ordering a crunchy roll, an order of cooked bulgogi, and a plate of sizzling jumbo shrimp. All of our plates came out in a timely manner except the bulgogi. When asked about it, the waitress played it off as though it accidentally got delivered to a different table. Now if you know bulgogi, it comes out in a loud sizzling plate that's pretty hard to miss. Being that this place is pretty small itself, I'm sure I would've heard it when my bulgogi came out - which it didn't. We tried to cancel the order since we were already done with our food anyways, but our waitress insisted that the plate was already being cooked. We waited for ANOTHER 20 mins before they finally brought our meat out, and by that time we were stuffed.   The food itself was ok, my only favorite was the flavorful bulgogi. Aside from that everything else is mediocre for the price.   The place wasn't crowded at all when we went, but the staff was a disorganized mess nonetheless. The lady took my sprite for a refill and didn't come back with it until we finished paying for dinner! Definitely will not be back.",

These two orders are the only two I am willing to order from this establishment and know that I will get the quality and safe food that I want. As for the other food, I can not say how good or safe it is because I haven't tried.   If you are coming here for a nice meal with acceptable customer service, you made a horrible mistake. This place has always had bad customer service issues. We have come multiple times and customer service is always an issue. Today, we were seated without menus while another party seated after us received their menus and were able to order before us. My husband had to get up and get menus for us himself.  Do not assume the waitresses knows the menu by item names. Order by the numbers. K9 or something to ensure they order in the right thing for you. Do not assume that the waitress put in your order. I have personally seen two occasions where the waitresses forgot to put in the orders.   This is one years worth of observation as a customer. As much as customer service sucks, I try and bear through it until the food comes out.",

When you walk in, you have the option of a regular table, or one with a BBQ grill built right in ;) of course I had to go for the grill option. I opted for the beef tongue that I will soon grill myself, and I went for the Pork Tripe and Intestine Stew that I requested extra spicy. Everything was phenomenal. The beef tongue was sliced paper thin and was so tender that it melted in my mouth. The stew was spicy but not too spicy, the tripe was tender and delicious and the intestines were absolutely amazing. The stew had the affirmations as well as pork, rice noodles, veggies and a spicy broth. This all came with a bevy of vegetable sides provided prior to the food arriving, such as kimchi, seaweed salad and many others. I would definitely recommend. I also can and will be back.",

After reading all the great things about this place, my family decided to try it out. When we walked in, there was no one to greet us. No sign indicating whether we should sit ourselves or wait to be seated. Then this short lady who was cleaning tables in the back, started walking towards the front door, no smile, no eye contact, rag in hand, we weren't sure if she was coming to clean a table, greet us or just getting something from her car. I asked her if we seat ourselves or wait for someone to sit us. She cut me off, pulled out a few menus placed them on a table and walked away. No indication that someone will be with us, for us to follow her or anything. We walked out, it seemed to be a good place being that there were many people there but with that rude service, I can not imagine how the rest of the experience could be. If restaurants are run that way in Korea, is fine, but not in the states where service is as much important as food itself. We decided to come to Kyoro Korean, which is close by, and had delicious food.",

    "text": "Ok i have been holding off on reviewing Takamatsu because how do you really write up your favorite restaurant? Obviously i love the place! The food is out of this world and my sushi chef is like extended family. My favorite food is sushi. I love to try new and fun places but it all always comes back to Takamatsu.   Ok so first : they have everything from sushi to Korean BBQ- to noodle bowls. If you love sushi and Korean - and a great noodle bowl - this is the golden goose of spots to eat. Yes they have cooking @the table or you can order it to taste. Yes they have ALL traditional Korean plates and yummy sides. I suggest the pork belly!   Second: i go there to eat SUSHI - this is my sushi spot. My safe place with amazing food. Its a perfect date spot! I sit @the sushi bar with Jon and i know im about to love everything that touches my lips. This is my happy place.   First fav: Tuna mango Nigiri and Spicy Tuna Mango Nigiri - this was created by head sushi chef Jon :) it is an amazing pairing of flavor and a not miss!!!!  Second fav: Sashimi Salad - this is a mix of tunas,salmon and smelt! With a spicy twist! The thought makes me salivate!   Third fav: Screaming Orgasm - a take on tuna tataki that is mouth watering and makes me literally moan how good it is. Its amazing!   And the last thing i love about takamatsu is that Jon shops for his Customers. He cares about quality in the fish and veggies and is always keeping the menu fresh. Now reading the yelp reviews i see the number 1 complaint is service time  - no Takamatsu is not a Fast Food Spot- the food here is made fresh and with love and that takes time- this is a Meal place - you come and have a Food Experience. If you are looking for a quick meal - i suggest you slow down and start appreciating what you let touch your lips.",

Have had 3 different types of BBQ at the table orders, and each has been top notch, of course this also depends on how YOU cook and season the grill and meat.

A group of us met here for their happy hour pricing, which allowed us to order mountains of sushi for an amazingly low cost. Considering the quality of the fish, we were all very happy. Especially the birthday boy, whose favorite roll is also mine: Spicy Scallop. O. M. G. So good!",

However, I had passed by here a few times and heard it was very good.   We came inside during the game and it was playing on one of their many TVs. The place had an alright amount of people inside. It wasn't loud inside. We ordered a bunch of items and beer.   The pricing was decent but we eat a lot even though we're average-skinny. The bulgoki was delicious, kalbi was delicious, and sul long tang was very good. We fried  up the meat ourselves on the built-in grill in the table. They also offer some Japanese cuisine as well.   Their selection of Asian beer is decent I guess. I wanted some Tsingtao but they have some regular Kirin beer.   The interior looks like they could fit quite a lot of people. Ambience was casual and well kept. The customer service was pretty decent. The parking lot was plenty of space though it was shared with nearby shops.  I didn't use their restroom but I'm sure it's clean. There's no smokers patio but you can just walk outside and smoke.   Overall, I would recommend this place. It's a good date night place and the food is good. Pricing is decent. Like I said, we ordered a lot because we eat like fat asses, heh.",

It's just that Americans are used to this western style, \"the customer is always right\" service that basically doesn't exist anywhere else in the world, or the really authentic places in the US.

It was packed when we arrived, so we sat at the bar and waited the 40 minutes for a grill table to open up, but enjoyed some delicious sushi while waiting. The sushi master made up a new roll just for the gentlemen next to us who was a regular and we requested the same. The sushi master said he'd name it the \"Santa Roll\" because of the holiday coming up. It was really tasty! The boss guy (owner?) and the sushi master were both extremely friendly, with playful senses of humor and all the staff were smiling and having a good time. They were walking very fast and hustling to serve all the tables. When we got our table to cook our BBQ, it was a good experience and flavorful food as well. Would go back again. (Afterthought. Very thirsty all night, must have been the seasonings they used in meat, whatever it was, my body can't get enough water).",

Both Korean. A city block apart. Only one can rule them all... Let's go!!!  Takamatsu:  Positives  +Fantastic restaurant atmosphere bright and open +full sushi bar in addition to your regular Korean favorites (sashimi salad is amaze balls shot out to chef John!!) + bbq at table  Negatives - service is can sometimes be subpar. ***message for the white people ( they're Korean, don't expect them to come over with a fake smile asking  \"how's everything tasting so far!?!? Every 5 minutes. No. This is not TGi Fridays)  - flavors are sometimes not as deep - not as spicy as regular Korean. If you don't like spice could also be a positive.  Cafe gang ha:  Positives    + stronger Korean flavors  +more unique sidedishes  + has dishes you can't get at takamatsu. (Du boki being my personal fave!) +open til the wee hours of 2am  Negatives   - restaurant is dark boarder line eery and less welcoming - does not have bbq in the tables  -crappy korean soap oprahs blaring on tv  I give both restaurants 5 stars because I love Korean good or bad! I go to both so take it from me! Takamatsu is the place you go to on a weekend if your with a companion and want to have a great night. Cafe ga hang is the one you go to during the week solo after work, just to enjoy a great meal.",

I would always get kalbi and sushi, or yukgaejang, anything.  It's all good, the table is always loaded with banchan and main dishes, the staff has been the same for years and they are awesome, this is the best Korean BBQ in Phoenix.",
