He looks at me like I'm crazy, then starts naming things off slowly...   him: \"you wanna know what's IN the burrito?\" me: \"yeah\" him: \"ummm, machaca, beans, cheese\"  me: \"nothing else?\" him: \"ummmm, naaaa\"  Well, I got it, not really any beans in it, and there was a liquid that looked cheesy, but not sure if it was actual cheese.  It did have some sort of sauce though and plenty of meat.  Overall, cheap and not bad, but also fell apart too easily.  It needs a stronger tortilla.",

    "text": "It's OK.    I hate to always be bitching about Mexican food in the Valley, but what can you do?  It's a disgrace.  The fact that this place appears to be some kind of Holy Grail of Mexican food here in Phoenix just seems to emphasize that point.  Let's deal with the food first.  This isn't really Mexican food. It's Tex-Mex food.  That means you've got your choice of tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.    We tried the \"Oaxaca\" burro (massive air quotes around the \"Oaxaca\" part of the name), which was just fine, but very, very small.  I mean seriously, i'ts beans, cheese, potatoes and a bit of chorizo - we're not talking ahi tuna here.  Why not give a normal sized portion?  We tried the menudo which was delicious but again, a miniscule portion. And they can't even be bothered to give you a plastic bowl, so you have to eat it out of the styrofoam to go container.  I mean, for F's sake, they give me a plastic bowl at my favorite taco truck.    Still hungry, we ordered a combination plate, which was the same sort of tex-mex crap that you can get pretty much anywhere in town.  Not so great.  It was all fine for what it is (I guess) but nothing that I would particularly go out of my way for, with the exception of the homemade flour tortillas, which were awesome.  I even bought some to go.  And that's about it for the food.  Now as to the restaurant itself, it's actually pretty disgusting, to the point where one has to conclude that they are just showing contempt for the customers.  The place is filthy.  The bathrooms, in particular, are vile. As Tony Bourdain says, \"I may not be able to look in the kitchen but I can check out the bathroom and that let's me know how much they care about the restaurant.\" Uh, exactly!   And the answer in Carolina's would seem to be, \"not very much.\"  The surly and uninterested staff add to that special ambiance.   We eat in lots of small ethnic restaurants and just because a place is \"in the hood\" doesn't mean it has to be gross.  Our favorite Salvadorean restaurant is in the hood but it's also hospital clean, which makes me pretty confident that the kitchen is also clean.   Finally, the neighborhood.  LOL.  To describe this street as \"in the hood\" is an insult to \"hoods\" everywhere.  This street is one of the most blighted streets I've ever been on, anywhere.  I'm actually thinking of going back there today to do some documentary photos to send to my friends in Cambodia whose visions of America are mostly derived from CSI Miami.  Seriously, it's appalling.  The main thing I was thinking about driving away from there is that the Phoenix city government needs some kind of federal intervention.  So would I eat there again?  Yeah, probably, if I was in the neighborhood.  Would I go out of my way to drive there?  No way.",

The machacha plate was good the meat was slightly salty, the beans and rice were good also... i like the tortilla though! it made the food better... i just like tortillas when they are placed over open fire i guess.",

    "text": "I was so upset about this place that I had to write my first review today.  I went to Carolinas today and placed my order.  I waited for about 15-20 minutes.  People who ordered after me started to get their food.  So I went up to the counter to the lady calling out numbers and giving the food to the people.  She couldn't find my order.  She was starting to tell the cooks to make my order but at this point I asked for my receipt back because I wanted my money back.  The girl said without being apologetic that I needed to go over to where I ordered to get my money back.  So I went back to the guy who took the order and asked for my money back.  He didn't ask what happened just opened the cash register and handed me money.  No apologies from anybody or acknowledgment of the fact that we waited and had no food.  I think this place has okay food but I will never go back because this food isn't SO great that I need to deal with the service that doesn't care about keeping customers happy.  There are much better places that I don't fear food poisoning from that are really nice to their customers.  I say the previous sentence because people who have been the place know that it isn't the nicest place.  In fact, it is the worst looking place that I have ever seen.  I can't believe I've eaten here in the past due to the way it looks.",

Consider the fact that I am a huge fan of my own cooking as you read this review.   Normally, this is a pretty good joint. It's not bad if you're jonesing for a taco or some really good beans (and don't want to make it yourself). It is considerably tastier than any Filiberto's, and more authentic tasting than places like America's Taco shop.   My faves are the butter-soaked tortillas, bean burritos, and chicken tacos. I keep it simple in simple joints. Today, unfortunately, it wasn't even close to as flavorful as it usually is. It wasn't worth the hour I put in at the gym afterwards.   But hey! Normally it is worth a stop, especially if one is deprived of Mexican food at home.",

    "text": "After reading some less than flattering reviews of Carolina's, I thought I would come to the defense of this iconic Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix, named after the kind owner. You see, I was craving some good Mexican after this bowl of cheap ice cream I just had for dinner (don't ask), and harkened back to a time when I'd frequent Carolina's while working in Phoenix in the 90's.   I think I have the bad reviews figured out, save for the gal whose rear end turned into a fire hose: The people were SCARED of the place, the area, everything. Yes, Carolina's is what you would call a dive, with a capital D. And, it is in the HOOD. I mean no disrespect by that, it's just what it is. When you consider the whole package- the neighborhood, the building, signage, interior, etc. it could definitely put some people off who are not used to such a thing. I mean, I understand, because I'm a guy, I'm not small, and the first time I went there I thought I'd be gunned down or kidnapped by MS-13 or something. Seriously, driving there I was aghast as I had never seen people in the US living in 40 year old, busted up cabover campers sitting on the dirt, with plywood shacks surrounding them. Not kidding.  But the food, the handmade flour tortillas, it's divine. When somebody cries that their soft taco just didn't hit the spot, I wonder WTF they were expecting. Maybe Taco Bell? How about get an imagination and order the Machaca Beef and Bean Burro and turn into an absolute wild animal because you can't eat it fast enough? That's what I'm talking about.",

First, it is not a restaurant per se but a fast food place where one orders from the counter.  Oh well, that is OK if the food is good but the menu was much like a Taco Bell with very little variation (tacos, burritos, chimichangas, etc.).  I ordered the beef enchiladas but to begin with I was really put off by all the styrofoam, everything was on styrofoam, the drinks, and the meal even if you were eating inside and then plastic forks.  No chips and salsa to start with just styrofoam!!  Then I had to take it back as they gave me chicken enchiladas even though it was marked correctly.  With that, I was looking forward to the meal but it was just 'blah', it was OK, nothing was wrong with it just not very flavorful (maybe it was the styrofoam! JK).  On the pro side, they were busy but got the order out quickly and they were nice enough.  However, if you are looking for a 'restaurant', this is not it, and you can pick up something on your lunch hour quickly and take it wherever but certainly not a dining experience so go with that in mind but there are too many good flavorful Mexican restaurants to go to than to hit Carolina's except for quickness and grab and go.",

The #10 Enchilada plate was delicious and the #5 Mechaca plate was incredible. For two people, we were easily out the door for under $15 with plenty of food. Definitely not a frilly atmosphere but the food is great, tortillas are made fresh out back and I can't wait to go back for more.",

I figured five minutes to get there, five minutes to drive back, I'd have 30 minutes to order and eat. BIG MISTAKE. After waiting 25 minutes for the burrito I ordered and paid for, they still hadn't managed to assemble a bean and potato burrito. I had to get back to my training class so I left without my burrito - just a flat Diet Coke in-hand. I definitely will not be ordering and dining in at this location again. Lesson learned.",

    "text": "If aesthetics were a measure of a restaurant's quality, this place would probably get a minus 5 stars.  I've been to tons of dives in my time, but this may very well be the divyest dive I've ever dived headfirst into.  That's not meant to be mean spirited to owner Carolina Valenzuela and her establishment, because in this case its part of the charm of a legendary Mexican establishment that I finally got the chance to try for the first time.  What this place lacks in aesthetics, it more than makes up for with its fantastic food.  The original Carolina's location is just south of Downtown on 12th Street.  Its an old weathered building that looked like it could've been a pawn shop or a tire dealer in a past life.  I think its fair to say the neighborhood surrounding the restaurant is somewhat impoverished, though theres a fair amount of industrial business nearby too.  Let's just say that Carolina's building blends in with the neighborhood.  That said, you'll be waiting in line forever at lunch as this place gets jam packed during the work week.  I opted to come here after work around 4:30pm.  Still, worried about the lines, I called my order ahead before I arrived.  When I arrived for my pickup?  Dead.  I was the only one there.  Maybe my timing was awesome?  I wasn't complaining as I was able to get in and out in two minutes.  There's a little bit of seating inside, but I was getting it to go this time around.  I decided to get a dozen of their tortillas since everyone seems to rave about those.  As for a meal to take home it seems that the chimichangas are a popular staple, so a beef chimichanga combo it was.  A big hearty beef chimichanga topped with guacamole and sour cream with a side of beans and rice.  Total for the combo plus the tortillas was $13.    The chimichanga is exactly what I was hoping for.  A thick crispy fried tortilla with plenty of shredded beef and spices to boot.  Goes great with the guacamole and sour cream, though the beef is truly the dominant flavor with this one.  The beans were also very good and had some good chunks of bean I could pick up (not a bean puree like other Mexican food spots I've been to).  The rice was pretty much what I expected.  Nothing wow about the rice, but met my expectations.  And the tortillas I got were enormous.  I decided to make a homemade quesadilla with one of them and I'm already stuffed.  But I agree with fellow Yelpers that its worth getting some of their tortillas.  They're made in house (you can see where they make them behind the front counter), and have a much different texture than the stuff you get at the grocery store.  Barrio Cafe remains my favorite Mexican spot in the valley, but comparing Barrio with Carolina's is apples and oranges.  Barrio is essentially gourmet, whereas Carolina's is Mexican for the masses.  Its inexpensive, the quality is excellent, and its been drawing every demographic imaginable for years.  Its not hard to see why Carolina's faithful turn to this dingy location again and again.  You can damn well be sure I'll be one of them.",

It has a little kick to it, but not too much, and although it's a runny salsa (as opposed to chunky), it has great flavor.  Have I had better Mexican food in my life? Yes. But Carolina's is a place that everyone should try once. It's an institution. I get the #13, which is an enchilada, taco, tostada, rice and beans. Awesome beans and rice. I suggest getting a chicken or beef enchilada rather than the standard cheese enchilada that comes with it.  The last thing I'll say is that a lot of people will look at the location and decide they're not going to go because it's in the middle of a neighborhood in downtown Phoenix. It is not dangerous. I'll rephrase that... It's no more dangerous than going to a chipotle in Gilbert. Cops and firefighters frequent the place, too, so don't let the location keep you from going.",

However, since Im giving 4 stars I obviously like the food very much. The chimichangas are the best we've ever had. My son over ordered (as always) and we shared both shredded beef and chicken wet with guacamole. We also ordered some tacos.  The food is tasty, and doesn't skimp on the protein. Excellent traditional mexican food. Service is friendly, although not too fast. They make the food to order and there's a line to expect to wait. It's worth it. A trip to Phoenix isn't the same without Carolinas.",

I can look past the neighborhood, and appearance. The counter was disorganized, people just elbowed their to the front of the line in front of others who were waiting to order. Staff behind the counter seemed to want to be somewhere else. Food came out relatively quickly for as busy as they were. Chips were on the edge of of being burned, very hard and unpleasant taste. Hot sauce, tasted watered down, different from what we love at the other store. Food was average at best. Chimichanga over fried, shell was inedible. Filling was just ok. Beans and rice ok. Friends meal, he said it was ok, but I think he was just being polite. Had half a bag of chips left and threw them away, neither of us wanted them. I think I'll stick to the Peoria ave location in the future.",

The floors are bare and seating tight so you wonder why it gets four stars?  The answer is simple, the food is absolutely spot on!    There are about a half dozen elderly Mexican women making fresh tortillas at any one time, the kitchen though sparse, turns out food you can't wait to eat and everyone dining seems happy with what is in from of them regardless of having to bump elbows with your neighbors at times.  One of my pre-travel rituals is a red chile chimichanga combo, which comes with rice, bean and a side of shredded lettuce, cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  Let me tell you this, they STUFF that freshly made tortilla with generously sized cubes of beef bathed in a delicious red chile sauce.  Refried beans may be refried beans but these just work, great consistency, texture exactly as it should be and taste \"just like momma would make\" (if momma was Mexican!)  I'm a fan of Carolinas and though you don't start to find \"frills\" in restaurants until you head several mies North or East, I make it a point to take visiting family or friends by to taste some of the best Phoenix has on offer.",

I will eat at a dive if the food is good but Carolina's is dirty, the neighborhood is sketchy and the food was really bad. I can't imagine how anyone could think the food at Carolina's tastes good. Did I order the wrong thing(chicken tacos)? I think not because my friends ordered other items and they were equally bad. The tortillas were stale and the chicken was so bland. It tasted like they threw some chicken in a crockpot unseasoned and cooked the heck out of it. I feel bad for Arizonans if this is what they consider to be good food.",

She said the chicken was juicy and delicious. So I ordered a chicken taco and a shredded beef taco to go. (I also ordered a dozen flower tortillas, because you know...flour tortillas!)   The chicken was good but was not my favorite. The shredded beef taco was amazing! Not too greasy, full of flavor with just the basics of cheese and lettuce.

    "text": "We landed into Phoenix last night and I have been craving a breakfast burrito with chorizo. I make my own from a recipe that is amazing so my expectations are pretty high. After reading the reviews for Carolina's, I was excited to try the food! Overall, the chorizo breakfast burrito with egg, potato, and beans is just okay. The tortilla is amazing, but the flavor is lacking a lot with the chorizo. The egg is mashed up into the potato, and then the chorizo is mixed up into the egg and potato. The burrito is pretty small too, so for $4.10 it's kind of expensive for a hole in the wall joint. The sauce is just okay as well. I would eat here again but wouldn't become a regular.",

    "text": "The customer service is extremely unacceptable. Providing background content, you must know Carolina's is ALWAYS popping. 9 times outta 10, there's a long line for dine-in and pick-up orders and that's a good sign when searching for bomb, cheap Mexican food. I can accept all the above because I'm ALL about supporting local hole-in-the-wall, Mom & Pop businesses. As much as I love their tortillas, burritos & flavorful red salsa; I'm upset about my recent experience. This review is to provide warning for future customers. Customer service is in need of major improvement!    I placed a phone order for Red Menudo, a quesadilla and 1 chicken/green chilli/rice burrito. Upon arriving the staff at the pick-up window didn't have my receipt order. She took my order over again and placed it for the kitchen. 20 minutes later I decided to speak up since lots of orders placed for guests that arrived way after me got served before me. Remember, my order was easy and quick to fix up. My instincts told me something wrong happened. Here's the fucked up part, I was standing right in front of the register counter the entire time watching for the staff to give me my order. I know they noticed me standing there longer than others but they didn't think to see if I needed help. So I calmly asked for an update on the order and the staff couldn't find it. They asked their co-workers where my order was and the cook said they already placed it out. They looked and looked for about 3 minutes and finally found it on a counter away from where phone orders should be. The staff gave me my order and I said, 'my order has been sitting out while I was waiting. I'm not going to be satisfied, I'd like to speak to the manager.' The staff said, here just take it. It's free. That meal would of cost $12 dollars and that staff's arrangement didn't fulfill my request for a manager. I wasn't pleased with the way my situation was handled. They didn't even get tSo in order to find the light in this situation decided to write this review and asked for a free dozen of flour tortillas (which they gave to me).  Foodies to remember to get your hard-earned money's worth. Yes, their food is bomb but your experience at their establishment should be better than mine. Management, prioritize customer service & satisfaction trainings. As humans, yes mistakes happen and we understand. However, what's the plan to ensure the customer still feels valued after the fact. How can you be better? I'm taking a long break from y'all. The experience was very unpleasant. Por favor, necesitas a cuidar su gente.",

I had to get some hot sauce out of the ketchup dispenser, which didn't look too clean, but I took my chances.  I would like to stress \"hot\" since it seemed like it was just \"sauce\".  I can't say too much about the taco since it felt like sustenance.  My sister's enchiladas weren't too bad.  Coming from the barrios of LA I definitely had better Mexican food.    The place itself is pretty simple. Basic tables and chairs nothing to wow and pop anybody, but I gather they weren't trying to.

The burrito was runny and soggy and the inside was almost like a can if Dinty Moore, the tamale was dry, very little meat, too much masa and didn't taste very good. It was a complete let down after hearing so much over the years and I would say that any local Filabertos has better food after my first visit. I'll give it another shot and that might change my review some.  The other reviews mention it's legacy and the dive location so I'll let them cover that as well as the butter tortillas.",

After getting off the freeway, I was a little confused on where this little Mexican joint was located. We were passing by random houses in a questionable neighborhood before we finally found it. Now, if this place isn't a dive, I don't know what is. The building reminded me of the old, rundown ones in LA, except this place was in the middle of desert.   We walked in and got some weird stare downs from locals. I guess we stuck out like a sore thumb in this neck of the woods. The restaurant reminds me of an old-school cafeteria. The tables/booths were are like ones from the 70's. You might know what I'm talking about, some old donut shops still have them. Our plan was to just eat a little bit because we had dinner plans a little later that night. We decided to get 2 tacos and an enchilada with a side of chips. Although Mexican isn't anywhere close to my favorite type of food, I thought the food here was lacking compared to all its' rave reviews. Even my boyfriend who loves Mexican food thought it was just alright. Unfortunately we didn't get to try their tortillas that they're famous for.   I don't know if Carolina's can beat the Mexican in SD. That's a tough call, but I can see how Carolina's would be a good spot if you're just in the mood for Mexican or maybe if it's late and you're piss drunk.",

The young man who took our order was very patient and helpful! We tried to order a little bit of everything so everyone could sample. (and yes...the tortillas are crazy-good!) Not a single food item was less than delicious...a couple were MORE delicious in our opinion. The shredded beef is amazing...so anything with that.  In particular DO NOT MISS the red and/or green chile burros! Everyone's favorites out of all we sampled. If you are a tamale and enchilada lover...then don't skip those either. The soft chicken taco was wonderful as well.  The salsa is thin but tasty...and the heat sneaks up on you after several bites...so don't immediately dismiss its impact! If you are feeling especially adventurous, try the two Agua Frescas flavors at the soda fountain! (Yummy and unlike any soda flavors in the USA) Between the crowds and the intense desert heat, I think this place really struggles with keeping cool...so either go before the hottest part of the day, or during a lull in the crowd to minimize your 'sweat factor'!",

Don't get me wrong, I'll eat anything, anywhere if it's good, so the totally sketched out location, and dive-y no frills decor (decor is the wrong word, there is no decor) didn't bother me. But I have to say, I've had vastly better Mexican food. We got the machaca hard tacos and the machaca was so bland. The chicken soft tacos were ok. The cheese enchilada was awful. The killer for me was the tortillas used in our dishes weren't fresh. Also, they ran out of tortillas which I wanted to purchase and I was bummed about that.  My husband, who used to work in the area and frequented Carolinas says that this experience was a fluke, perhaps because we were there fairly close to closing time (although I don't think that's a valid excuse).  I wasn't impressed. Hubby wants me to return for breakfast with him and give this place another shot. Eh, I won't go out of my way to come back but if I'm in the area (unlikely) I guess I'd be willing to give it another try :/",

No American ham, sausage, or bacon and you won't miss them at all.

Yes there were people waiting for their to go orders but I would think with the amount of time they've had of being a popular restaurant & being opened for business that they would have come up with a designated person or better phone order system. Not only that - the place needs a serious renovation. With the amount of money (multiple locations) I'm pretty sure they could afford to do a little at a time because it's seriously needed.  The food though, is pretty damn good. I'm not a big fan of their rice or beans. I usually come for the buttered tortilla, chorizo & egg burrito & my husband gets the machaca, egg & bean burrito.",

I'm a Az native and have gone to here for years. Only reason to go is the food as the service and housekeeping has been bad since they opened. I have seen the help change several times over the years but you get the same crappy service. With a little direction and competent management they could put the US treasury out of business because they would be printing money!!so visit them with a empty stomach a lot of patience and tolerance and you should have a mediocre experience. Good luck. If you want a sit down dinner with food just as good if not better go to Comedor Guadalajara on Central and the 17. Check it out.",

Once we ordered though there was a huge line that was forming.  I order a beef tamale and a machaca hard taco for under 5 dollars.  Even though they say soft only for the machaca taco, they will do a hard taco for you. I ate the taco at work and I brought home my tamale and decided to give it to my husband and he ate it seriously in 2 mins. What a fatty!  Yes, the place is a hole in the wall.  The place may look shady. However, I must say I would make the trip down here any day of the week so I can eat their food. I used to eat here 2 times a week when I worked down the street. Tip: When you want to go during lunch, make sure to call ahead and place an order because you might be waiting for a while or if you go after 1:30 it calms down more so you can find a seat and enjoy your food.  These are the only 2 things that I have gotten when I go here. Next time I will branch out and get something else to try it out.",

It's proximity to the airport made it an easy jaunt after landing.  The place is not much to look at, but I choose to believe that's because they are focused on a great product and not touching up the paint.  I had a hard time choosing, but I ultimately settled on the Oaxaca Special burrito.  It comes with beef chorizo, beans, potatoes, and cheese.  Generally I prefer a few more ingredients in my burrito, but they did a lot with a little.  I thought I would miss having rice or pico de gallo or hot sauce in my burrito, but I did not.  The ingredients were all quality and were liberally apportioned.  Even the tortilla was high quality.  I also give their salsa (located between the soda machines in a pump) high marks.  I'm glad I made it in.",

The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. It's an eat-in or take out place. It has several tables and booths, but its a relatively small place. That being said, the times that we have gone there, we've always been able to find a spot to eat. The only reason that I gave it a 4 stars is because the outside and inside isn't the best to look at. It could use an upgrade, but then again, maybe that's what appealing about this place. I would rather have a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place with tasty and delicious food rather than a fancy chain restaurant that is appealing look-wise but mediocre food. I hope this place continues to prosper because it deserves it.",

    "text": "So, I have been doing well on my diet the past month or so, but it was about time for a cheat meal.  Tacos were definitely in order!   I had been to the other Carolina's locations before and have loved their food.  I decided to come down to the OG location today for lunch.  About that....I would highly recommend that you don't come here during lunch hours lol.  I got here around 11:40 and thought I would be able to beat the major lunch rush.  NOPE!  Walked inside and there was a line about 30 deep!  It took a little while to place my order.  Once I got up there, I went with 4 shredded beef tacos and an order of chips and salsa.  I had $12.00 in my wallet, and my total came out to $11.98!  Score!  Since this place was a madhouse, I decided to get my stuff to go.  I took it out to my car, threw up my sun shade and turned on the A/C and went to town.  Here is how they were........  Shredded Beef Tacos-  These things are fantastic!  Like I have said before, next to Tito's Tacos in Culver City, these are probably the best shredded beef tacos I have ever had!  They fry these tortillas crisp, then stuff them with well seasoned shredded beef, cool crisp lettuce, and a ton of shredded cheddar cheese.  Top them with their awesome red hot sauce, and you have damn near perfection!  I mowed these down pretty quick and honestly, could have ate about 2-3 more.  My first taste of carbs in a month was damn delicious!  Chips-  Their chips are great!  They are incredibly crunchy and always fresh.  They could probably use just a little more salt on them, but if you dip them in their amazing sauce, that makes up for the lack of salt.  Definitely pick up an order of these when you come.  They are fantastic!   I'm glad I made it down to the OG location.  I might not be heading back to this one (The Cactus Rd one is closer to home/work and tastes the same...excellent!) as often as I would like, but if I am near downtown and want some tacos, this is THE spot!",

Someone in line behind me said the chimichangas are amazing so that is what I had.  Chicken with guacamole.  The prices are good but the food is amazing!  The chicken was hot and juicy.  The tortilla shell was crispy and fresh.  The guacamole hit the spot and the red sauce super spicy and delish.  What a treat!!! So glad I found this place.  It may have taken 8 mins to get my food which is not long to wait for such a treat!   Will definitely come here again.  Well done Carolina's!",

I have a rule of thumb when it comes to ordering Mexican food: order a bean burrito upfront, if they manage to f@(k up a basic bean burrito don't bother ordering anything else and never come back.  Undoubtedly THEE best bean burrito I have had EVER!!! That said, I ordered the 3way, PSA-this is not some freaky style sex act so don't get your hopes up pervs, it is a combo burrito of red chile, green chili, and beans. Fantastic combo to have wrapped in the house made tortillas. The tortillas BTW are what holds this place together, yes that pun was in fact intended. I will definitely be making another trek into south Phoenix to visit this little gem of a place and will post pics.",

    "text": "Usually Mexican food served out of an outdated building with numerous building code violations is always the best. Not so much in the case of Carolina's. I arrived on a Saturday about 11 am to a short line and I had heard from one longtime Phoenix resident that this is the real deal. I had to try the famous tortillas right? So, I ordered up a cheese quesadilla and a red machaca burrito. How does it end up that Arizona and Nevada have completly different ideas of what machaca is. It is supposed to be dry beef grilled with onions, peppers, tomatoes and eggs. But in Phoenix, it is basically shredded wet beef doused in red or green sauce. Regardless, the Carolina's version was miserable. It was mushy and tasteless and since the thin tortillas could not hold all that beef inside, it turned into a knife and fork thing. I barely ate three bites of the mess and some fat was also discovered lurking in that meat.  Not good. Same thing with the quesadilla. Due to the tortilla being so thin, the cheese overwhelmed the item turning it into a cheese wafer. If I want Machaca, I'm heading back to Nevada next time to a state that knows the True definition of the dish.",

The neighborhood will scare you if you are not comfortable eating amongst the Hispanic community in their own backyard but if you can get past that you will not be sorry. Building is dilapidated practically and the flooring just old concrete. But dont be scared....  Dont make the same mistake some other reviewers made and order stuff thats not on the menu.  And please people dont take your kids there and order chicken nuggets for little Timmy because he doesnt like spicy food.  If its not on the menu its not their specialty.  Order the red or green chile \"anything\" and chips and salsa and it will be fine.   Homemade tortillas the size of a flying saucer and hoemade chorizo too. Did i mention this place is super inexpensive??  It can get super busy at lunch time so get there early.  You can find Phoenix's finest here for lunch (from law enforcement to other government/city employees).    If you are Hispanic and venture out to eat the kind of food your mom makes you....this is the spot you go too.",

On a 6 day vacation, we ended up here 3 times and our drive was about 20-25 minutes each way. It's that good folks! If I lived closer, I would have been more adventures and tried more things on the menu...but the feeling of not eating more machacha made me want to cry.   A #7 combo is where it's at. The machaca is AMAZING. I also had a bite of a chorizo burro, also amazing but I had to stick to the tacos.   Pro Tip: Don't be fooled by the horchata in the fountain drink thing-a-ma-bob....it's awesome! Give it a swish in your cup and you're good to go!",

First of all, I am not scared off by the way the place looks, at all, yes, it might not be located in one of the most affluent or desirable of neighborhoods, but that doesn't present a problem for me. If there is good food, it doesn't matter. Second of all, the tortillas ARE very good, no doubt about it, but that might be the ONLY good thing we got out of our visit to that place. Me and my family were looking for a place to go eat menudo, we wanted a real good, flavorful menudo, and while we were driving, Yelp! took us there, with the promise of good menudo. When we got there, there was a line, but that only meant to us, that there was good food too. We were looking at the menu, while moving up to the cashier, and noticed that they do not serve menudo... like EVER! So, that was a little deceiving. (The website says they have it on Saturdays, but that is the day we visited and NADA!) When we got there, my kiddos got a bean and cheese burrito, which, if it wasn't for the good tortillas, it would have been the same as ordering one at taco bell. My hubby ordered the Oaxaca style burrito, that had nothing very \"Oaxacan\" about (\"Beef Chorizo with Beans, Potatoes, Cheese\"... Oaxaca, me think not!), along with a tamal, don't remember what kind, didn't mater, wasn't good either. I ordered the green chile beef, which I was looking forward to. When we got our order, our kids enjoyed their burritos, my husband was OK with his, enjoyed the tortilla very much, but said that nothing special, and me, when I started eating it, a white goo came flowing out... it looked like the sticky goo we use to make home-made pinatas called \"Engrudo\", which is a mix of hot water and enough flour to get a gooey consistency, and I think that's what they served me with some chunks of tenderly cooked beef. I went up to the cashier, and told her that my green chile wasn't green, that it looked like \"engrudo,\" she said that was the green chile, I asked \"Is it supposed to look like this?\" she gave me a little shy smile and said yes... the ladies making the tortillas just looked up and smiled at me, and I went back to my seat, opened up my burrito, picked out the beef chunks, scraped off the goo, and ate my tortilla... So, no. If you ask me if I am going back to Carolina's again, my answer is no. It too long of a ride, too bad of a food for me to do that. Like I said, I've had better... and will post pics to show you the whitish \"engrudo\" goo they served me... yuck! ** Good thing I didn't get a cockroach in my burrito, like the other lady, that would have been so terrible!",

As much as I'd like to make this a five star review I just can't, I've been visiting this location for years and stop in as often as once a week at times. With that being said the last three visits I've noticed a significant change in how full my burritos have been. I understand many establishments have taken different measures to balance the raise in minimum wage, if this is the case for the change of quality and size of the servings of food here at Carolinas, as a customer it would've have been nice to have received a heads up or even a small price increase rather than be treated like business as usually when theres clearly and noticeably there has been a change",

They changed the parking a little bit so it's difficult to park on Mohave, but the lot on the west side of the building usually has a few spaces.  Although the surrounding neighborhood is a little run down and the wrought iron door can be a little intimidating, there is plenty of great food inside.  Ordering is pretty straightforward and they're great at the basics.  The tortillas are always made fresh and you can see them prepare it.  Machaca isn't too common in the midwest, so it's always great to get some eggs, salsa, and machaca breakfast burrito.  It comes out hot and the tortilla is a little floury.  The value is always great here and there is plenty of spices and seasoning in anything you try.  The chorizo and potato breakfast burrito is also one of my faves.  A great place to start the day!",

I got in at 11:40 am and ordered. 20 mins later (Still Waiting for my order) they announced that they ran out of Beans and Rice. How does a Mexican Restaurant run out of beans and rice before lunch? People came in and they took their orders not telling them there was going to be an hour wait. It got to a point that when people did get called to get their order the people that were waiting Cheered. After another 20 mins and most of the people getting angry, I went up to cancel my order and get my money back. The person behind the counter said that my order was 5 mins from being done. I decided to wait and 20 mins later they still did not have it ready. I had been there 1hr, so again said I wanted my money back. they said it would be a few mins to get a manager. after 15 more mins I get my number called just so they can tell me that they could not fill my order. I said, I know I want my money back. the person behind the counter said sorry, the order was ready except the bean burro I ordered. I said just put in a taco in the bag. They said OK and as I stood there they got it ready. The food is good at Carolina's but they lost a customer from bad service. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN.",

This isn't the Biltmore B!+@#3$; this is Carolina's, take or leave it!  I've been eating the burritos from here for years, thanks to my work. When you need to feed a hungry crew of construction guys, this is the place to order from!  I finally made it over to Carolina's for the first time about a week ago. The parking lot was packed, big dog included, (waiting for his share no doubt) the line long filled with suit wearing business men, utility workers, even the Maricopa County posse knows where to go for good food. You won't wait long, the 20 plus employees make this joint roll like clockwork. Watching them roll out  dozens of tortillas, (probably thousands per day)is amazing. These tortillas are enormous and melt in your mouth like butter. They sell them at only $5.25/dozen $3.25/half, definitely worth every dime! You can't beat the burritos, great flavor and cheap at around $4. My favorite is the Machaca w/egg and the chorizo; add a little jalapenos for kick, top it with their delicious salsa and you've got a fiesta in your mouth!  Step out of your neighborhood and come to Carolina's!",

Arrived at 11:15 and was told my order was not ready and that I can pay when I get my order. Register girls have no personality by the way. I proceeded to the already full waiting area, and this is where my 50 min wait began. 2 registers, one for in store orders and one for to-go. There were two customers paying for 10 separate orders individually, which took forever, while food was sitting there getting cold.   When my number got called at 11:50 by the not to go order register, I told the I cannot smile girl that I had called in my order almost an hour ago and had been waiting over 45 mins, she said not one word and took my card, and handed me my order.  The burritos were falling apart as clients were eating them and felt really bad. They did love the flavor! I would love to bring them more burritos, but really can't find myself going that again.  The whole order process is in dire need of some organization and friendly people!",

    "text": "First off, I should mention that I am from Tucson, which I consider the Mexican food capital of the United States.  On a recent trip to Phoenix for a Diamondback's game, we decided to try the very well reviewed Carolina's for a bite to eat.  I am very glad we did.  Carolina's isn't a nice, sit down restaurant where you are going to take out of town visitors for dinner.  It's got tables, chairs, and a walk up counter for ordering your food.  Oh, and a huge menu, with some of the items available in bulk (pounds of chorizo, dozens of tortillas), and it seems to have all these items available all day.  I tried a combination plate with enchilada, taco, beans and rice.  The taco was great, with a homemade shell and very good shredded meat (which seems to have been formed into a patty) inside.  The beans had a good flavor, and the rice was fluffy.  While the enchilada tasted fine, I prefer my sauce to be a bit more orange (this was blood red), and less bitter.  My husband had a footlong chorizo and bean burro, which he said was very good.  Now, about these supposed \"best tortillas in Arizona\".  That title is still held (in my opinion), by St. Mary's Mexican food in Tucson, but these were very good.  Huge, and a little thicker than St. Mary's, they were good enough for us to buy a dozen to take home.  Overall, the prices at Carolina's were great, the food was very good, and we will be stopping back on our next trip up to Phoenix.",

While there, order some tortilla's (either corn or flower) to take home.  They're fresh baked, still hot when you get them.  This isn't a restaurant to sit around and socialize with friend's. It's located in a cinder block building with bars on the windows. Also, they do not serve alcohol.  Try to get there while the sun is still shining. If working near downtown Phoenix and going to Carolina's for lunch, get there EARLY! The place is packed for lunch.",

If you have been Carambas, it's exactly the same tihng except it has more hype and there is more seating. Otherwise, the setting, format and style of Mexican food is exactly the same.  Carolinas is good but I heard amazing things about this place....along the lines of Best Mexican in Phoenix and nothing could be further from the truth.  Again, it was good food but if someone served you this food and made no mention of Carolina's, you wouldn't be able to distinguish this food from several dozen Mexican style pseudo fast food eateries.   The salsa is also overrated. There is nothing special about it. Imagine if you took pico de gallo and regular runny salsa and combined the two.  That all this salsa is.  It's as if they poured the two into a vat and just mixed it.   Sure, if you live near this place or your work place is near it, you should certainly check it out. You will enjoy it but you will not be mesmerized by it. I would definitely not go out of my way to eat there or take people there.  In short: Highly Disappointed but still enjoyed the food.",

    "text": "As a Southwesterner, I'm inundated with Mexican food restaurants. American fast food mainstays like McDonald's are drowned out by hole-in-the-wall shacks ending in \"-berto's.\" But the fact of the matter is, for all their ubiquitousness, most of these taco stands are downright awful. I mean, they'll do in a pinch, such as when you're drunk at 1AM and looking for something to compete with tequila for the remaining space in your stomach, but no one ever says, \"Man, the burrito I had at Filiberto's was stellar!\" That's just not the itch those places scratch.  So, you can imagine how apprehensive I was when I walked into Carolina's Mexican Food and found that it did indeed look \"dive-y.\" Would the food fit the atmosphere? No way, Jose! Carolina's served up some of the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona. This is the real deal: tortillas that melt in your mouth, chorizo that hits just the right savory/spicy notes, and a red chili sauce that bites back.  I ordered the Oaxaca Special, a savory symphony of chorizo, potatoes, chese, and beans. For a burrito that fit snuggly my hands - at a price of $3.50 - it filled me up just as well as a $5 burrito from a \"-berto's\" joint, albeit with more flavor and better presentation.   Having dined with three other family members, I had the chance to sample three other dishes. The quesadilla melted in my mouth like butter. It's no wonder people line up out the door just to buy Carolina's tortillas. My wife's chimichanga, through some sort of black magic, was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Does the kitchen staff practice brujeria? Maybe. I'm not sure.  I am sure of one thing, though: when I have an itch for great Mexican food, I'll be making the trip down to Mohave Street. You won't find better Mexican food in Phoenix at such an attractive price point.",

We checked out the menu, made our selections, and ordered; he got the beef enchiladas and I got the flautas with beans & rice, plus a tortilla since they have such a reputation.  We only had to wait a few minutes before our food was ready.  IT didn't disappoint!  The flautas were crispy, the shredded beef was flavorful, and the sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese were just right.  The rice was really good, but I think I'll skip the beans next time.  My fiance's beef enchiladas were good and he finished them all.  The best part, though, was the tortilla.  Amazing.  Before we left, I picked up a dozen to enjoy later. Oh yeah, baby.",

If you like the ambiance of a mess hall with grungy concrete floors.   No pictures of anything on the walls.   And you don't get turned off by this.   If you want  to take a date here, don't.     Personally, we love to try places in the heart of a Mexican neighborhood because you get the real deal.  The real folks who come to this Phoenix institution, however there are quite a few gringos like us.     As soon as you get your order you will find the food is oh so good.  You know you are in the right place.  You order at a counter and can see into the kitchen.  There must have been 20 ladies making homemade chips and tortillas.  The prices are really great and they have a rather basic menu.  I had the chicken enchilladas which were wonderful.  Usually, I get the green sauce but I forgot to mention that and so it was the red sauce which was incredibly good.  Hubby had the enchilladas with beef and it was equally as good.  Going to Carolina's is not just for the food.  It is the whole experience which you get upon entering it.  I took home some home made tortillas.  They are without a doubt the best ones I've had.  You can get lots of food by the dozen, but being I live in Tucson it is too far to have them make the trip back home.  Besides I would have nibbled on them going home.  So all in all, if you can deal with the ambiance of the place and just want some \"down home\" Mexican cooking, by all means give Carolina's a try.",

    "text": "Carolina's is likely the most 'authentic' and delicious Chihuahuan-style food in the Valley, at least that I've come across.  This is the style of Mexican food that I grew up eating, and although I love the whole spectrum, this type is my favorite due to its greasy-ness, inclination to corn tortillas, and beef ... lots n lots of beef.  Carolina's is certainly the bare-minimum of establishments.  There is an order-counter, almost soup-nazi-esque as far as the intimidation factor goes, but the staff is extremely friendly and will help you customize your order.  You then have to wait for your number to be called as you stare at your oozing tiny dixie cups of salsa in anticipation.  I always get the machaca burrito (holy smokes, my mouth is literally craving it now -- dammit, why did I write this so close to lunchtime?)  with sides of rice and beans.  I'm a bitchy critic when it comes to the latter, as the entire female familial line of P.'s can work out some magical rice and beans, yo ... and these compare favorably.  I wish Carolina was in my family.  Oh, and they rock red Fanta as a soda option because they F'ING KNOW that the Mexis love their strawberry bubblegum flavored drinks.  I can never pass up this option no matter how hard I want Dr Pepper or Sprite instead.  Some sort of congenital condition, like its a vital fluid, that red Fanta.",

The food is great hands down and the prices are almost the same in Mexico getting street tacos.

To those who gave 3 and 4 stars because it's not shiny clean and chain-like: who cares?  The machaca burrito may be the best burrito anywhere - and I'm from Southern California.  I grew up eating SoCal Mexican 1-2 times a day (and it is still the best in the US on average).  I ordered another one halfway through the first, along with a stack of fresh tortillas to take back to New York.  This place is right by the airport and I almost want to route myself through Phoenix sometime just to go back.",

They have the best beans, tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it, I promise you will thank me.    This place is streaming with professional business people, police officers, firemen, construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.    The only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that add's to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolina's recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek, same food but much nicer location.    As an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!",

I was even happy when my family moved - we ended up closer to Carolina's.  I love the authenticity of the food but the lack of grease. I admit, sometimes I do like that greasy, fatty Mexican style food, but Carolina's is just as good without all that.  I may be a bit boring, but my favorite is the #9 - the two machaca beef tacos plate. it's simple but perfect and always hits the spot. We also love to get tortillas and chorizo and make our own breakfast burritos to take to work or on the go. I also can't get enough of their hotsauce - quite possibly the best thing to come out of a ketchup dispenser since... ketchup.  Be careful when you go. It's the busiest right in the middle of lunch - I've even seen a full fire engine take up the parking lot on their lunch break, and parking is limited. My secret? Call in a to-go order, and beat the long line when you arrive.   While the location may be a bit out of the way, I recommend everyone make the trip just to try it out. This hole-in-the-wall taco joint definitely stands out against other popular stands (I'm looking at you, Filiberto's!!)",

I'm going to pretend like I didn't read some of the reviews about the place being in the \"ghetto\" and not wanting to be there after dark, etc. My office is just across the street, and while I will admit that the neighborhood is different than the one I live in, I've never felt nervous about being there. Most of the residents of the neighborhood whom I have met and worked with are hardworking individuals just trying to make ends meet. Ok that's the end of my soapbox tirade.   Moving on, we eat at Carolina's quite often since there aren't a whole lot of other options within walking distance and I'll be damned if I give up my covered parking space in the summer! I actually like the \"cafeteria\" type style of the place, and will occasionally eat there instead of ordering food to go.   I love the Machaca burritos, and the breakfast burritos are to die for (and at $3 a pop, you can't beat it)   Bottom line, I highly recommend checking out Carolina's for some good Mexican food!",

Yes, it's 'dirty' (although it has yet to fail a health inspection), and yes, it's not in a gentrified neighborhood where every building looks the same,  but it is some of the best 'home-cooked' Mexican you'll get this side of the border.  Personal favorites include the machaca, chorizo, and of course the tortillas.  So if you want great street style Mexican food, this is the place for you,  but if you're uptight drone  who value style over substance stick to the tex-mex joints in your generic suburban strip malls.  Remember to pick up a dozen or so of  their home made tortillas you take with you.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are amongst the best tortillas in the world!",

More specifically, there are VERY few dishes that one would exert extra effort/distance to enjoy. The chorizo, egg, potato burro is one of those dishes, second only to St. Mary's (Tucson) carne seca, egg, potato burro.",

I also like the cost of tortillas which are good enough to grab two dozen of and run to your car and devour them until you feel the need to put the seat back into the food coma position.  When I worked close by, I would stop in sometimes for the Oaxaca for breakfast...hangover be GONE!  Lunches usually steered me toward the green chili beef enchiladas. I once found a small rock in them and was not even swayed. Sometimes you just have to eat a rock, though I spit this one out.

Why is there cheese always on my tacos? The cashier even selects the no cheese button and they still pile it on. I even mention this when I place my order and they still get it wrong. Not sure why this very simple process is such a hard task?   If your going during lunch plan on waiting. The lines moves fast as they have plenty of staff cooking the food.

Use to be one of my favorites for red chili until I was introduced to Ritos red chili burritos. But other than that everything is good, can't leave here without taking a dozen tortillas and at least 1 quesadilla!!!",

    "text": "I was responsible for ordering lunch for my department and this place was chosen by popular vote.  I ended up going the catering route as we had quite a few people to feed.  I worked with Irene over the course of 3 days to finalize our order.  I found her to be curt but was helpful and patient nonetheless.  We ended up ordering the mini burro platter with sides of rice, beans, and pico de gallo.  We made an appointment for the pick-up time of 11:30am on Friday and it was ready when I walked through the doors a couple minutes before 11:30. The staff was friendly and took the time to make sure I had everything we ordered.  The burros were very much enjoyed by my team (myself included) and they are really miniature and cute in size.  I really liked the tortilla chips and the rice was my second favorite.  Very nice flavor on both items.  I would consider ordering from here again for lunch on my own but may be awhile as it is a little bit of a drive from work and I don't like driving far for lunch.  I agree with other comments mentioning its appearance.  It is quite rough and old to say the least.  The pictures provide a really good idea of the appearance but I think it's quite a different feeling when you're there in person.  But don't let the scary appearance drive you away; this is really good Mexican food and that's saying a lot because it's my least favorite type of cuisine.  Tips:  They do have a separate catering menu that you can request by email or phone if you are wanting to order for a large party.  This is recommended for 15 or more guests.  They do offer delivery of your catering order for a $25 fee.  Delivery is only offered for parties of 15 or more guests.  Call to see if they will deliver to your address if you are interested.  Utensils are an extra charge.  It may be more affordable to provide your own rather than purchasing it through them.",

The burros are excellent, green chili, machaca green chili, bean and cheese and chorizo are favorites.  The tamales have gotten smaller as the years have gone by but still tasty and a must, I prefer the red tamale.  The tacos are the real type, not the current trendy street tacos but real hard shell deep fried with lettuce and cheese and of course grease.  If you are looking for a trendy upbeat place to eat this is not for you, it is hot in the summer with the horrible swamp cooler and if your chair has a back you are lucky.  Come for the food and t all E home a dozen tortillas.",

I ordered the @3 way burro - green chile, red chile and beans wrapped in a tortilla made here. The heat level was just right for me and I thought the green chile was excellent. The red was good but just average. I also ordered a hard shell beef taco which was on par with homemade.   The location is not in one of Phoenix's best neighborhoods but it feels safe here nonetheless. The staff was friendly, the prices are cheap. The dining room is worn down from their legions of fans and definitely needed some attention after a long day of diners. Overall, good authentic Mexican food at a price that's more than fair.",

The food is always tasty, I recommend any burrito, as they're huge and wrapped in homemade tortillas.  Remember to take home a bag of chips and/or tortillas! They're cheap and super fresh.  Four stars for never having carne asada and the weird salsa bar.",

    "text": "I love Carolina's. Just not yesterday, November 11th, @1:45pm at the Mohave St. location. Just to be sure.   It's not my fault I only have 30 minutes for lunch so I went to Carolina's at the Mohave St location and I ordered a taco and enchilada, both beef. 14 minutes later my food arrived. The place was not crowded and that's too long for a taco and enchilada.  My God, there's 10 people - minimum - in the damn kitchen...  SO SLOW AT THIS LOCATION. This horribly slow service has NEVER occurred at the Cactus or Sun City locations and I've been eating there for years  The taco was delicious, the enchilada not so much.  Three small cubes of beef in the whole enchilada!  The corn tortilla was old and tough. Or very tough and old. There was lots of gravy (red sauce) which is good, but not to cover the less-than-minimum amount of beef. It's not a beef enchilada if it doesn't have any beef.   But the really bad news is the food made me ill: 90 minutes later: cramps, diarrhea.   And I've got a cast-iron stomach so it isn't me, it was the food.   So let's review what we learned: slow service, 1 hit (taco) and 1 BIG miss on the beef- enchilada-with-very-little-beef, that, oh, by the way, made me ill.  Thanks for nuthin'!  Never again this location.  You either, if you're smart.",

I don't know who told these people how to make tortillas, but the ones my daughter bought were extremely large, limp, and thin--not at all like the authentic Mexican tortillas that I have gotten at many many other places.  Flour tortills are supposed to have some substance to them, and they shouldn't be tough and hard to tear, like these were.  The place is a dump--I fully expected to see roaches crawling up the walls.  I didn't see that, but things like access to the ladies room by walking behind the beverage dispenser are totally unnecessary and not very appealing.  I ordered tamales--they were just okay -- not as good as the frozen ones I buy at CostCo!  The beans were fine, and the unlimited beverages is a plus.    I didn't have the ability to give this place only 2.5 stars, but would have if the ability had been there.  I know that this is the \"home base\" and \"original\" of this chain, but I felt very uncomfortable in the neighborhood and the restaurant, and I believe that the owners could clean the place up and turn it into a more appealing building/eatery.",

Carolina's is located in the most ghetto neighborhood in all of Phoenix. It doesn't matter how hard they try to make this neighborhood look good with new fire stations and the like, it is still going to be ghetto.   I had three tacos. I was hoping for taquitos but they were no where to be found on the menu. The tacos I did have cost $2 each and they weren't any better than what I could have gotten at Dell Taco. If I had gotten three tacos at Dell Taco I would have only paid $1.28, but here I paid $6. Tacos don't even have tomatoes on them! The food comes in take out containers regardless of whether or not you are eating in or out. Don't expect a lot of food because the containers are not that large. The food my co-workers got didn't look that much better than mine.   The inside of this place is a real dump. For as much money as this place brings in, you think they could update it or add more seating. Even a new paint job on the interior and exterior would go a long way. Somehow they think people enjoy the charm of a dirty Mexican restaurant. I don't think that many people care, because they are there just to eat and get back to work as soon as possible, not to enjoy themselves.   If you go here for lunch, you will end up waiting in a long line. And seating will be hard to find as the place is packed during lunch. Carolina's is probably better suited for take out. They serve food like a cafeteria; you order from the menu and they call your number. It is quick authentic Mexican food, without the fast-food nostalgia.",

The only issue I have with this place is that its very well used, and looks very dirty, I did find it a bit sticky. Maybe this is a better place for pickup.

Well, I review the exact address, and note that the address (1202 Mohave Street) matches the \"ghetto\" building with all the nice cars parked afront.  \"Well, that must be it!\"  I park. Then I walk up to the door. The entrance reminded me of a homeless shelter or food bank.  As I entered, the restaurant was filled with people.  Since then, I have repeated visits to Carolina's with a few favorites...  - Chips and Salsa - Shredded Beef Taco (Crispy) - Cheese Quesadillas - Cheese Enchiladas  The food is low-priced. For example, tacos are about $2 each. Burritos are about $4 each.  Additional Notes:  - Closes relatively early in the evening. - Serves breakfast.",

    "text": "Ah, the grating, whining sound of privileged white people who accidentally wandered outside their stucco-and-Xanax gated communities and saw what the real world looks like. Here's a news flash: Carolina's is a Mexican food restaurant in a neighborhood where--shh!--actual Latinos live!! In their native environment! How breathtakingly edgy! We could be killed at any time! Oh my stars and whiskers! Someone protect the Escalade!  Enough already. It's not the Ritz, sure. But by LA or San Francisco or New York or Jersey or Philly or even Denver standards, this rapidly-gentrifying South Phoenix neighborhood is a walk in the park. Grow a pair and go get some of the best Mexican food you'll ever have. Carolina's tortillas are sublime, widely hailed as the best in town if not the entire Southwest. The machaca tacos will knock your socks off. Their beans are deliciously flavorful but not too heavy, and their rice is perfectly seasoned.  The chips and salsa are likewise fantastic, and the service is fast and friendly--especially if you're a \"regular\". They do a brisk business all day but expect an especially good crowd at lunchtime. Carolina's has a second location on Cactus and Cave Creek, and it's much less terrifying to poor whitey--cleaner, more upscale, in a nice safe suburban strip mall, and their food and staff are likewise great--but confidentially? It's even better here, at the original Carolina's on Mohave. Besides, with the number of EMTs and police officers who eat here all day, you're in good hands. There are a lot of good people and good things outside of Arizona's endless, funereal, racially and economically segregated gated housing developments. Get out of those self-made prisons and live a little.",

Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but that's way too long for simple taco truck orders.  The salsa cups are like the size of a THIMBLE so I had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town. The gauc is good.

I just know that some folks are willing to eat quite a bit of food that they might not eat if they saw where it was from.  Now that they are converts - I am tempted to take someone with me next time I grab their food - or maybe send them alone.  But I don't want to ruin a good thing.   For the price of this food, you could get Taco Bell.  But if you can get Carolina's, why would you ever get Taco Bell?  I've always grabbed it on the way home from work - so around 6ish.  I have to say, besides the fact that it's in an older neighborhood, I've never seen any of the other things that seem to scare some of the other reviewers.  Maybe I'm just lucky.  Who knows.    All the food is so good I don't even know where to begin on what to suggest.  Something with a tortilla.  They are just that good.  Or - get whatever else you want and buy some extra tortillas to go.  Eat one on the way home like McDonald's Fries.  And just like Fries, they are SO much better when they are still warm.    5 stars for food, but losing some for parking and then their limited and spotty seating in the restaurant.  Wish I could go 4 1/2.  Special note - They have some of the best Christmas Tamales in Phoenix.  But don't think you can just walk in and get them.  I'm not sure how soon the waiting list goes up, but you'll want to get on that list ASAP.  They sell out quite quickly.",

Even trying to explain how fellow Yelpers loved it, did not ease her fears.  After a unanimous \"Defnitely, it's awesome!\" amongst the three battlers of the flame in response to my \"Is this place worth going to?\", we parked the car and walked on in.  This place is a definite hole in the wall (read: DUMP) and I/we LOVED it!  Great chicken tacos, awesome machaca (shredded beef) burros, delicious chorizo and the tamales were equally spectacular (homemade of course).  It's located in a somewhat dicey area of Phoenix, due west of the airport, but it's totally worth going to.  It has become my new \"first stop\" after I get off the plane at Sky Harbor.....unless I land too late at night....",

I was amazed to see two hummers, a porsche, two beemers and a handful of trucks at \"7: 30  AM\" Breakfast burritos (Machaca+eggs) were so good, I drove back from Scottsdale for breakfast. This place is unbelievable. I highly reccommend a visit and buying a few dozons of tortillas (they freeze well, but separating the tortillas with a layer of plastic wrap will make your life very easy). If you have \"done\" Carolina's - SHOUT OUT!",

I was ok that it was a run down looking place, was even willing to go in 115 weather knowing they only had swamp coolers, this is how bad I wanted to try it. I ordered the red chile and bean burrito. The red chile had no flavor and was not even a touch of spice. Either they forgot to put beans in my burrito or they put a very small amount. I was dissapointed in this burrito. I also ordered a dozen tortillas, heard these are sooooo good.  These were good and a huge size. I wouldnt go out of my way for these. I know plenty of other mexican bakeries that make good tortillas. I may try this place agian if someone I know really wants to go, but i will not go out of my way and this is not a place I reccomend as good mexican food. I think alot of the good reviews were people who think taco bell is mexican food. Sadly dissapointed :(",

My hands down favorites are the green chile burro and chorizo potato burro, but I'd probably take anything they threw my way.

People will bitch, and let them bitch; if they don't like this place, stay the fuck away, then.  This is MY joint.    Pretty much the best thing they've got going on there is the green chili cheese tortilla.  It is something to behold.  Every single time I've been there, I've ordered one.

Do I bring out of town guest to this location on purpose?  That would be an affirmative.  When I first went to Carolina's 4 years ago with coworkers for lunch, I thought \"you people must be outta your damn mind.\"  But then I considered that one of my coworkers was nearly a septugenarian with a bad limp from a war injury, and I told myself to put on my big-girl panties and walk in.  And boy am I glad I did!  I've tried several things: tacos are awesome, the green machaca is amazing (frankly, it makes me happy in my pants it's so good), the Oaxaca special is great, the enchiladas are eh to me, but lots of people freak out over the sauce, so def try it.    As many others have said, the proof of how good the food is in the tortillas.  When my boyfriend (still living out of town at the time) brought some of the tortillas home, his roomie joked that he could wallpaper his house with them.  They are big and beautiful.  Another thing to note, when I took my man here for the first time, there was a grandma-type coming in with two HUGE stock pots.  I figure, that has to be a good sign that it is worth it to her to hoof it in and out of that place for that much food.  Yes, 12th and Mohave is well, for lack of a better term (and I apologize for the un-PC-ness) is in the barrio.  But for some reason, the sketchiness adds to the experience.  It's always busy, not matter when you go, and ladies, there usually ARE hot firemen there on Fridays for lunch.  So go for a happy tummy and some eye-candy.  Truly, a can't-miss experience in Phoenix.",

It was a chinese restaurant, which become clear as soon as you walk in the door and see the crazy colors and zodiac symbols.

I come here at least once (more if I can) whenever i visit.   Their flour tortillas are HUMONGOUS. Like, kind of out of control. The fold them over twice to get them in the plastic bag when you order a dozen. Here's a tip! Don't store them like that or they start to crack from being folded/unfolded over and over again when you want to take one out of the bag! And nobody likes a burrito warpper with structural flaws   They are so fresh and warm when you get them, the bag steams up with their goodness Another tip: rip a small hole for the trip home or else that steam makes them gummy and stick together - again endangering the structural integrity. Yet another tip: Don't throw them into a suitcase which shortly goes into an airplane's hold, or you'll arrive at your destination with frozen tortillas due to the moisture in the bag+high altitude cold air   Refried Beans: Carolina's Unsung Hero Seriously delicious. When you can order something as simple as a bean and cheese burrito and feel like it's the best meal you've ever had, you know you got something special.  Fair warning (and I'm sorry in advance veggies): both the tortillas and beans have lard in them.  If you're planning to eat in, be aware this is not really a restaurant. It's like a small tortilla factory/ordering counter that has some card tables and plastic chairs strewn about. I sort of took this for granted while talking Carolina's up to my (British) husband and mother in law. By the time we got there they must of thought I'd lost my mind. Then they took their first bite and never doubted me again :)",

My two friends got the tamales and I got two machaca soft tacos. My friends said the tamales felt like it was just soggy bread and that there was too much dough and that the chili wasn't spicy. They added that the beans were good but the rice was a little stale. My two tacos were a good size for the price, bigger than most at equal prices. The meat was seasoned very well but the meat to lettuce ratio was off...I didn't order a salad. I should have gotten the hard shell because it was so greasy, just looking at the soaked tortilla I could feel the grease seep into every orifice in my body. The horchata came from the soda dispenser and was awfully bland. Actually, that sums up our experience here...\"awfully bland.\"",

It was a bit unorthodox for my managers who usually eat at much 'nicer' places. But it wasn't long before they opened up and said that this reminded them of home! I was impressed with the food, a bit disappointed that they don't have carne asada. I had to settle for machaca, which was good. My new office is located a quarter mile from here so I have a feeling that we will be visiting more often!",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying out this restaurant as many rave about the delicious food. I moved from CA & in search of delicious Mexican food.  Boy was I disappointed! We drove over 25 miles for dinner at Carolinas. First and foremost, if you are into Bean & Cheese burritos then this is your type of eating place. But if you're looking for authentic Mexican food with a variety of dishes then this isn't for you. In my opinion it seems as if Flour tortillas, Machaca, Beans & shredded beef is the main dish. Meaning, be prepared to decide on Burritos/Tacos/Tostadas or Combination plates that consist of just that: Machaca, shredded beef or beans. The chorizo tostada was not all that either. It comes with Beans, chorizo, shredded lettuce & tons of cheddar cheese. The chorizo is Not meaty as I hoped it would be. Do expect it to be oily. Your choice of drinks are fountain drinks, so expect what can be a delicious home made Horchata drink to be a watered down fountain Horchata (awful!!) You will not find Carne Asada or a variety of salsas in this place. In fact, there is only 1 type of salsa & that is red.   By the way, not sure what region of Mexico this food is from but the Beef Green Chile has been thicken with flour. Which makes the chile more of a gravy. Seriously! Not what a True Mexicana like me is used to eating.   In my opinion this restaurant has incorporated tex mex into the dishes. Overall, I'm glad we didn't pay an arm & a leg for this meal as that would have made the drive even more upsetting.    I will continue my search for another authentic Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "Oh burrito, where art though?  I haven't had a good burrito in quite a while and decided that I wanted to visit Carolina's in South Phoenix (12th st and Mohave - just south of Lincoln) . I hadn't been to Carolina's (Cave Creek and Cactus) since we moved from North Phoenix a while ago. As my first visit to their downtown location, I was quickly reminded why this is one of my favorite Mexican food spots in Phoenix.   I waited in a line filled with of \"out of place\" business casual, police officers, and Mexican nationals alike. This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.  With ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me. The fresh made tortillas are super thin, tasty, and never seem to break when you eat them, like many others will do.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, Carolina's serves up some mean Mexican delights!",

Ate here for lunch immediately upon our arrival at PHX airport and again for breakfast the next morning.  Portions are plenty big but not overwhelming.  Huge menu to choose from, and everything is very reasonably-priced. On both visits there were all kinds of customers: locals who lived and/or worked nearby; locals who probably drove in from a ways; people walking out with huge take-out orders for multiple people; and plenty of tourists like us.   Located just a few blocks from PHX, if you have a long enough layover and a strong enough hankering you just might be able to get there and back to the airport in time.  Definitely try Carolina's if you get to Phoenix.",

However,  The customer service is terrible! They almost never answer the phone. And when they do, they immediately put you on hold. For a long time. But If you don't pre-order, your order will most likely take about 25-30 minutes. They currently do not have an option for ordering online. In person, the employees are not very friendly. Granted, they are  usually pretty busy, and so everything feels rushed. But when you arrive to the counter, they usually don't even acknowledge your presence.

My favorite is thing getting their crispy beef tacos. I either will get the meal with beans and rice or just the tacos a la carte with chips and guacamole and salsa. Their salsa is HANDS DOWN the best in town. It's a red chili that has a garlic spicy taste to it. I absolutely crave it. It's delicious.   They are very reasonably priced. And very authentic. Again, you're going to wait a long time, but their employees are nice and the good is WELL worth it. I highly recommend any of the Carolinas.

The chicken soft taco was good but the liquids made the home made tortilla disintegrate when I tried to pick it up. Save the soft tortillas for things you stuff yourself like carnitas or as a side. The tamale was a little disappointing. Good flavor but a lot of masa to beef ratio. Also, the meat was a bit tough and there was some unappetizing gristle.",

This has to be HANDS DOWN one of THEE BEST MEXICAN FOOD spots in the city! Known to have the best tortillas in town!! And I must say, they live up to the HYPE!  I enjoyed a bean burrito with a chicken taco and a side order of rice!! Sooooo <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb.com</a>!!   My cousin HIGHLY suggests the machaca meat! And red Chile.  While picking up my order from the counter, I over heard the employee taking a phone order and asking if they had any more chicken. They were running out of food items for the day! Which obviously is saying something!!   This place is a WIN if you're looking for some good home cooked tasting Mexican food!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! I'm feeding you no lies here at all!",

When I read some of the reviews I actually got out of my way to stop by this spot before heading to the airport, what a disappointment.   Both the machaca plate and the beef tacos had no flavor at all. The beans were bland so was the meant, a stupid amount of lettuce that I could've shared between 2-3 more plates... YES that much lettuce.   Did I stop by it on a bad day? I do not know, but I do know I did not like the food, also the workers not friendly whatsoever! And I'm Mexican lol   Sadly I won't be going back to that spot. Didn't like the food nor the service. Too bad.",

My mom says that she ate nachos w/ jalepenos on a regular basis while pregnant with me.  Maybe that explains it.  Anyway, I've been wanting to try this place forever since they claim to have \"the best tortillas in town.\"  I seized the opportunity to check it out since I had to drop a friend off at the airport this morning.     The exterior certainly leaves a lot to be desired, and the ambiance is about on par with the drunk tank at the fourth avenue jail (a good friend spent a most unfortunate night here and described it in detail).  The cold, stained cement floors, nasty old booths and 70's McDonald's style swivel plastic chairs which likely  needed a new coat of paint back in the early 80's.  I decided on a green chile burrito and my companion ordered the egg/chorizo/potato/cheese burrito.  After waiting for about 5-10 minutes, our number was called.  The first thing I noticed was that the burritos were quite small.   I knew, however, that I was in for a real treat with the piping hot, super chewy freshly made tortilla, and I was not disappointed.  The green chile, while tasty, had too much liquid and after inadvertantly puncturing my tortilla, I was left with a handful of sauce.    I certainly felt more than safe inside this place (despite the somewhat scary clientele) based on the table of twelve Phoenix police officers sitting across from us.  Overall, I would give the atmosphere 1.5 stars, and the food 3.75 stars.   It was definitely different than what I'm used to, and it gave me a small taste of the cultural melting pot known as South Phoenix.",

Sure, the neighborhood is rough, but the real shocker is how dirty this place looks, inside and out.  Why 5 stars, then?  At Carolina's, it's all about the food.  The tortillas are, as already stated, to die for.  They're soft, yet strong.  Your burrito probably won't be exploding all over itself mid-meal.  I'm a huge fan of the Oaxaca Burrito, which contains generous helpings of chorizo, potato, and other delicious goodies.  The machaca is also very good.  Back to the dump factor (that sounded gross, sorry).  Normally I am easily creeped out by restaurant filth, but not here.  Carolina's reminds me of Christmas Eve parties at my Nana's.  Everyone sitting at shoddy tables in a little room, eating delicious food.  The only thing missing is the mariachi.",

A few other things, seating can be quite the pain when the place packs up, and it really gets packed around noon.  However, I do think the atmosphere is definitely part of the experience, I have been to the other locations, and there was something lacking there.

    "text": "I noticed just today that I still haven't handed out the coveted fiver to any Mexican restaurants yet, which is probably because I've only been rating places in Dallas.  For Mexican at its finest Phoenix is my city of choice.  And in this fine city is Carolina's, the epitome of everything a Mexican place should be, the gold standard for Mexican food if you will.  Here's why ...  1) Cheap - Carolina's does to money what Jesus did to bread and fishes.  Find some change in your car or couch and you can feed a full family.    2) Delicious - Pick anything that rhymes with maraca (i.e. Machaca Burro or the Oxaca Special, my two faves) and get ready for it to blow you freaking mind!  Oh, and how could I forget ... The buttered tortilla is a piece of heaven, especially once you get to the middle.  My wife once made the mistake of having me hold her tortilla while she went to the bathroom, and after several minutes I just couldn't help myself and ate the butteriest middle bite.  She still to this day has not forgiven me for that.  3) Ghetto - Every time I come here I'm worried the roof is going to collapse.  There's no back on my chair that's been bolted into the floor.  I would not come here at night for fear of getting my burro stolen, among other things.  All this adds to the experience.  This place is as good an excuse as any to plan a trip to Phoenix.  If I lived here Carolina's would be the sole reason for me weighing 300 pounds, it is literally that amazing.",

This place isn't much on the eyes, but your taste buds will probably spontaneously combust with enjoyment.  If you're going durring lunch hours prepair to stand in line, and it'll probably be out the door. Apparently more, and more people are finding out about it. Dispite the line, it moves relatively fast. You can also call in your order before you get there too. Mine is speed dial 5 with the brail on it in case I go blind one day.  While you're there, try a butter tortilla...Carolina's make they're own tortillas fresh.",

The outside of the restaurant is a bit run down and could scare potential customers away. However, that is what gives it great character and makes for a great  place to stop by. The food is amazing and the customer service is excellent. Would recommend to anybody looking for authentic Mexican food.",

The tortillas themselves were awesome, but the bean/potato burro was way oversalted and the green chili chicken burro was missing....the green chili (even though it was marked as such on its wrapper). When I discovered this oversight, I headed back to the counter but by then the line was 25 deep so I gave up and sat back down. Hot sauce is dispensed into plastic cups the size of the top digit of your pinky finger, which defies all logic. Why make them that small? I ended up filling 6.   And that famous weekend menudo special? Sold out by noon.   Anyway, I don't mind the diviness of the place at all. I understand that it's not in the most savory of neighborhoods, so I wasn't expecting anything fancy. But the fact that there was a whole lot of trash scattered about the floor and none of the employees in the dining room were bothering to clean it up was a little strange to me.   Maybe it was an off day for them. Or maybe I'm tired and cranky after what was already a long Saturday. I'll come back and give them another shot, but for now, I'll be heading back with lowered expectations. Hope they prove me wrong the next time around...",

    "text": "Wow- another Phoenix area Mexican food disappointment. Went here on my way back from the airport. I was told I had to try this place near the airport- \"looks  like a dive, but the food is awesome.\" Nope- the food tastes like how the place looks.  I ordered a chicken \"burro\" dinner- which is a burrito in this part of Phoenix I guess. It had boiled, \"runny\" chicken and some salsa in it. The chicken water was running down my hands as I tried to eat it and all over the table. The beans and rice were good- but not the best. The chips were okay- again not the best- and served in a bag with a tie around the top, like buying some chips form the grocery store. (I prefer warm chips) The red hot sauce was very good, though. The staff was pleasant.   I think this place has more of a cult following than food that is good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I went to a similar concept restaurant in Mesa- Backyard Tacos- and it was in different league than this place.  Oh- the place is worse than a dive. (physical building)  I don't know why the city doesn't condemn the inside of this place. I've been to many dives- but this was a sub-dive. Please someone tell me a good Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. 2 years and still haven't found one....",

Otherwise, they would be hurt by their terrible location, old worn out building, and lack of accommodations for groups larger than 4. Having said that, the food obviously matters above all because there is a constant flow of people from all classes of life walking through their door.   I've tried the enchiladas, tacos, and tostada (all excellent). I even purchased a dozen flour tortillas to go and enjoyed a piece of Carolina's at home the next week.  Don't expect to sit down and be served but you can expect great food and a piece of Phoenix history. I recommend phoning in the order and picking up. I see a lot of people walking in and grabbing their phone order to go.",

    "text": "The restaurant was founded in 1968 by namesake Carolina Valenzuela, who still presides over the kitchen.   It was first at 105 W. Hilton Ave. and later at 1519 E. Mohave St.   Since 1986, it has been at 1202 E. Mohave in a building that also has housed a coin-operated laundry and a grocery store.        No one is bothered by Carolina's vague pricing.   People just order what they want with the understanding that their tab, including a large, refillable drink, likely won't exceed $5.        The tortillas, which are available by the dozen for takeout, are churned out by a crew of workers who stand before a bank of hot griddles, deftly flipping the paper thin rounds of dough and piling them up for packaging.      I am particularly partial to the soft-shell machaca taco.   It's a simple affair with a warm corn tortilla wrapped around a generous portion of the subtly spiced shredded beef filling.   It's a perfect starter before tackling the main course --- one of Carolina's incredible burros wrapped in a homemade flour tortilla.    The plain bean burro is majestic; the green chile burro, marvelous; the red chile burro, legendary; but the Oaxaca special with beans, chorizo, potatoes and cheese is pure heaven.    The rich, piquant flavor of the chorizo is enhanced by the cheese and potatoes and tempered by the beans and the chewy tortilla wrap.    Carolina's burros can be ordered enchilada-style with red or green sauce, lettuce and cheese, or deep-fried like a chimichanga.     Reprinted from an Az. Business Gazette article:May 1, 1997,",

    "text": "The best machaca burrito I have EVER had.  This place is a dive amongst dives.  No expense was spared decorating the interior... literally, no expense.  But the food?  Divine.  When I'm in Phoenix, no matter the purpose or the duration, I swing by Carolina's for a quick bite and a quart of machaca or red chili to-go (about $21).  I've sampled several things over the years and now make a b-line for just one thing:  I order the mixed machaca burritos ($3.50).  That \"mixed\" refers to the shredded beef AND a scoop of homemade refried beans, all wrapped into an incredibly tender/fresh tortilla (which they also make that day, ON-premises) along with a good dose of cheese.  Together, these three simple ingredients -- the cheese, beans and slow-cooked machaca -- create a flavor symphony that my palate would turn it's nose up to if approached by the fanciest French restaurant with a free dinner offer.  I get two of these and plop my butt down on the dirty plastic booths, close my eyes and (try) to savor each bite as slowly as possible.  Sadly, I'm always done in about 5 minutes.  I have eaten these on the road as well, but they are messy!  The bottom will almost always begin to leak juices from the shredded beef before you can even get halfway done.  If you dare to eat/drive, be sure to have some kind of tray (not a napkin or their thin paper plate, but a TRAY) on your lap... and wipes for afterwards!  With a location that is barely 1 mile or 1 minute off of the freeway, on the southern edge/entry to Phoenix, it is a mandatory stop for me when I'm in Phx.  There is a large parking lot that surrounds two sides of Carolina's and the interior is swamp-cooled (so it'll be muggy-hot during the summer months).  Drinks are fountain/self-serve style and utensils are all plastic/self-serve as well.  Note, there is a single bathroom, but it is very cramped (just a bit larger than an airplane) and it is less attractive than a Chevron's (I probably wouldn't even let my labrador use it... but I still love this place!!)  Oh and one more note, this diner gets very, very packed during lunchtime (11:30a - 1:30p) with suits, blue-collars, cops, everybody!  Even during the afternoon there is a constant, albeit shorter stream of patrons.  But do NOT hang out in this neighborhood after dark... let's simply say, it is a very, very tough part of town.",

I find that a lot of Mexican restaurants tone it down when it comes to the level of spiciness they add to their food, to match some American taste buds, I guess but not Carolina's! I've been living in the valley for 8 years now (moved from California) and this is the best Mexican food in the Phoenix metropolitan area.   Their tortillas... HUGE. And I mean it... HUGE, biggest tortillas I've ever seen. They look like XL pizzas! And don't you think they're big only. They're big and flavorful. Reason why they've won awards before.  Now, say it with me: TA-MA-LES. You've never had a better one than the ones they make at Carolina's. Seriously. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I could eat there every day for the rest of my life.",

    "text": "Wow. If you're looking for some basic, delicious Mexican eats this is the place to be. Went for lunch and the line was crazy (for a reason). They have a walk-up ordering system where you order and pay and then wait for your order to be called. There's somewhat limited seating inside (only because this place is crazy popular) but people cycle in and out pretty quickly too. The air conditioning was struggling on the 110' day I showed up but the heat was soon forgotten as i was eating the food.   I opted for the chicken chimichanga which was phenomenal. There's very little flair about the dishes, they're quite basic but TASTY. The chimichanga was a little crispy pocket of fluffy tasty chicken heaven.   I'll be back to this place next time I'm in town.",

I am not sure what authentic Mexican food is because I've never been to Mexico...but it felt like if Taco Bell was to ever become an authentic Mexican fast food chain, it would be Carolina's. Not in a disrespectful way, but the food came out fast, really cheap for what you get, the flavors were amazing, and you had to grab your own drink.  I would definitely come here again.",

I've had the for breakfast, lunch and dinner - not in the same day - that would be crazy.   The place doesn't look like much, and is very bare bones inside, but don't let that dissuade you.  It is minutes from the SkyHarbour airport rental car center.  You'll find all kinds of people dining there.   The menu is big, you order at the counter.   I've tried other things, tacos, enchiladas and flautist are good, chips are homemade, salsa (aka hot sauce) is too - its a little different tasting, but good. But the Tamales......amazing.

You will not find a better place for Mexican fast food in midtown; no matter that it's looks as if it's never been remodeled since it was established.   This is the spot I hit up for the best tasting chorizo with potato and eggs burrito, the smoothest, tastiest tortillas, the tamales (try the #11 combo) and the machaca.   Service is slow everyday, calling ahead can be frustrating because you're always placed on hold for MINUTES.  But hey, it's worth it all after a few bites of that chorizo burrito.   This is the only place we buy fresh tortillas for our parties and during Christmas and New Years we order tamales, although the tamales have become woefully smaller through the years.   I promise, once you get a taste of this food, you'll return again and again. Enjoy yourselves.",

    "text": "Well, this is the place. Off the beaten path, just south of CenPho, serving family recipes since 1968. The food is to die for, it's the real deal.   I remember my mother discovering this place more than 30 years ago, introducing me to green chili for the first time. A nearby project has allowed me to stop by often lately.  Today I tried the 3 way burro which is loaded with red, green chile, signature beans and melty cheese shred. The piquant first bite of either end will set the tone. The handmade tortilla is thinner than most, but you don't seem to mind as the flavors burst on your tongue. Today it was red chili first. After 2-3 bites you can expect the other end to start leaking, so watch out! The beans are whole and add character and substance to the most excellent combination of flavor and tortilla snap.    The whole thing took only a few minutes to wolf down, wishing you had slowed down to savor it a bit longer.   At $5.25 a dozen, the handmade tortillas to go are a bit pricey, but they are big burrito size and have the feel and texture of rural south of the border. Hmmm? What to load them up with when home? Half dozens for $3.25  There are mex choices for anyone who likes good home cooking. Breakfast in the morning, lunch and dinner available all day except Monday. There are Burros, specialties, tacos, tamales, enchiladas, combination plates and some light items for the discerning kiddies. There's something for everyone. At the end, you'll find yourself licking your fingers and chops for more.   This unique place is not easy on the eyes. It's rough hewn, comfortable enough, stark seating and practical. I imagine they do a half a million $ in takeaway a year. Authentic food takes leaps over the ambiance.   You'll never know who you will see here. All walks of life know good food by history, word of mouth, not to mention the family element through the years.   Not a miss on any mex foodie list!  I'm going back for more! 02/21-19 Went back 2 weeks ago and still agree with what I wrote!",

The food... ugh. I don't even know where to start without going into a food fantasy, where I am the queen and the chimichangas are my edible servants. *10mins later* anyway, the chimichangas are clearly my favorite, they're always so hot and fresh and stuffed with so much meat and flavor one could probably faint. The rice and beans, which is hard to get wrong but does happen, NEVER happens here, they're always delicious and tastes like actual beans. Another one of my favorite things about coming here, is their option to buy a pack of FRESHLY HANDMADE TORTILLAS!!! I buy a pack EVERY TIME and happily put myself in a cheese quesadilla comma for the next couple of days. I don't even mind the 5 extra pounds. Love this place.

Not about YOUR Expectations. Its a tortilla factory in a sketchy part of town that sells food from a counter. its also very busy, because everyone else who knows the deal is there willing to suspend their \"restaurant experience \" for some awesome food.  This is about the Tortillas, the red chili, the Machaca, the beans, the chorizo and potatoes. Did I mention the Tortillas?  I grew up in Southeastern Arizona, and have a certain level of expectations about Mexican food, and about Tortillas in particular. When the wife and I were young,  dumb (me not the wife), newly married and moving down here to finish College at ASU, we tried all the \"local\" Mexican food places. I won't call them out by name, because it's not worth drawing their ire or making them feel bad. You don't talk badly about people you went on one date with and realized it was all their was ever going be five minutes into the date. You just move on.  Likewise after choking down  several different versions of bad \"locally made\" tortillas, i just realized i would have to be nice to the rural relations in hopes their visits would include tortillas.  THEN, i attended a work party, that the boss had graciously picked up 50 red chili mixed burros for. WHAAAT? where the heck did these come from? did someone make a trip to Globe or Tucson? Using every bit of my best Spanish inquisition impression, i found out where and when this great secret was located. Seeking the holy grail, i found it and make repeated pilgrimages since.  The best are the burros, although the other items are good also. Breakfast burritos, particularly the chorizo potato and eggs are heavenly, right amount of spice and portions.  Machaca is best in town. You heard me, the best. good flavor and portions. right balanced. tender  The secret menu item not a secret, is if you are going to just order tortillas to take home, and believe it or not it happens, get  a hot buttered tortilla for a snack. So Good! its the best part of your childhood revisited.  So, if you are jonesing for some real sonoran mexican food, especially for takeout, go do yourself a favor and go get some. And pick up a dozen tortillas to eat on later in the week.",

Maybe the owners will put some money into the location that has made them millions. An air condition would be a good start. I am sure your customers and employees would really appreciate it. I will check back in 10 years. Hopefully they will have soap in the mens room.",

Some of the best tortillas I've ever tasted and i grew up in the southwest.  price is cheap too.  i recommend ordering the Oaxaca (pronounced...Wahaka) burrito or the #13 combination plate.  The Oaxaca is filled with homemade chorizo, beans, potatoes and cheese.  The #13 plate comes with a beef enchilada, a beef taco, a bean tostada and beans and rice.  All for about $6.  Also, did I mention their tortillas are that good??  order the butter-tortillas for about 90 cents.  Place is located in the heart of the barrio, but around lunch time you'll find people from all walks of life in there.  firefighters, police officers, academic counselors, business men from corpo america, etc...",

The description said that we might fear our surroundings.  They were right!  There are bars on the windows!  But oh well.  Because you know you are in a good Mexican restaurant when there are more Mexican-Americans in line than anything else and you can see them making the tortillas in the background.  Oh yum, you are in for something good.  Adding to the ambiance is that your order off a very large board where there are no descriptions, only names of foods written in Spanish.  And you won't recognize LOTS of the words.  But why order a burrito when there are 15 things you've never heard of up there.  Go for some adventure!  I did and wow was it a good choice.  Delicious tamales.  Awesome pork burritos.  The rice and beans are amazing.  And they have a nice variety of Mexican fountain drinks for the adventurous.  Stop #1 on vacation was a good one.  Go and don't worry about the neighborhood ... they will know why you have come!",

I have had most things on the menu (no menudo though) but my fave is the machaca burros and crunchy tacos with a half dozen of the 1oz salsa cups. And after filling up on this I snuggle up to a dozen of warm fresh giant tortilla's (still in the wrappings of course). I like to order a quart of the machaca for later consumption in burro's, over rice, with eggs, my list could go on.   You would think with the mounds of money they have to be making from the constant lines of people they would do some upgrades to the place. Oh well, keep the food great and we will keep coming.",

None of this matters when good Mexican food is to be had. But nothing in the #6 or #8 combo was above average. The edible items were the rice (average), beans (below average), and the chorizo/potato combo which was better together than the sum of its parts as the chorizo itself was below par. The tortillas, despite their reputation, are average at best and only if you like the paper thin variety. The enchiladas were inedible as the sauce tasted worse than store-bought and there was no cheese to be found. In fact, I left most of it where I found it.    Being Hispanic from San Jose and having eaten homemade Mexican from both my grandmother and during a two-week trip at age 19 to the middle of Chihuahua where no one who served me food spoke English, this is neither authentic nor tasty. Hate to give Mexican food bad reviews anywhere but this place keeps popping up on ten-best lists where it should be on a ten most overrated list. As a first timer who visits from California if I had to try something else from the menu I would go with the breakfast burros, but doubt I will ever go out of my way to give it a second chance.",

    "text": "Upon arrival at Carolina's Mexican Food, one might be a little distrusting of the location. Although they're placed in a sketchy neighborhood in downtown phoenix, Carolina's food is far from bad. Their building is painted white with red lettering that informs newcomers about their famous tortillas. On the inside there are AC ducts completely visible on the ceiling, next to their multitude of ceiling fans. The cement floor and old walls are equally run down.  Although this may seem very displeasing, the food definitely makes up for the lacking interior design.      The food at Carolina's is best described as delicious, authentic Mexican cuisine. They are best known for their large and thin flour tortillas, for which they have won multiple awards. The chicken and machaca (beef) is delicious in any of the dishes they have. My personal favorite was the chicken mix burrito (which includes beans and cheese) and chicken quesadilla. The chicken burrito is filled with delicious refried beans and gooey cheese, along with juicy chunks of chicken, all wrapped up in their glorious tortillas. The chicken quesadilla was very large, with some dry spots of no cheese near the edges of the tortilla, but the center was packed full of savory pieces of chicken and cheese. Their salsa that is made on the spot is also incomparable to any other salsas I've ever tasted. All in all, everything I ordered was delicious and authentic tasting.      So in short, Carolina's Mexican Food is a 4 out of 5. The only reason that it isn't a 5 out of 5 is because of the location it's in and the condition of the interior. If you don't mind going to a worn down restaurant and you're looking for some great food, Carolina's is the place to be. It is now the standard by which I rate all Mexican food, making many other \"Mexican\" restaurants taste like McDonald's. Also it would be valuable to note that although it may seem like a bad portion of town, police are a common sight in the restaurant and so is anyone else that knows where to get an amazing burrito! I will definitely be coming back to Carolina's in the future.",

It all adds to the overall charm of the place.   The food, of course, is top notch. As good or better than their West Valley location. Service is quick, and sometimes even friendly, though not uniformly. It was an experience I hope to repeat soon. Just great, basic, Mexican food.",

    "text": "Those of us that work in the downtown Phoenix area usually stick to places that are within walking distance when going out for lunch (we don't want to loose are good parking spot, right?!). However, a couple times a year, some lovely soul will decide to make a run to Carolina's and offer to get lunch, or breakfast, for a few people.   This is where you can tell if you are in the cool crowd at work. We all know what it is like when you have to order and pick up food for 20 people = NOT FUN! If you get invited to join the \"let's order from Carolina's\" group, you know your haven't made anyone mad that day!   I've only had the burritos and tacos but both have been delicious! The breakfast burritos are great.  If you let the tacos sit too long, they will get a little soggy/greasy, but in that really good way! =) Hot sauce is the perfect amount of spice, just about a medium I would say.   The best part is the tortillas (corn or flour) that you can buy by the half or full dozen an take home to enjoy with your own creations. Warning: The flour tortillas are HUGE, yet soooooo good!!!!   If someone at work mentions Carolina's, and I am lucky enough to be on the invite list, all previous lunch plans are in the trash and I am reaching for my Carolina's menu to scope out my selection!",

There were a handful of Mexican restaurants that really impressed and did not seem like the TexMex you come to expect.  Carolina's is the top of that handful of restaurants.  It gets packed quick at lunch time and often times you have to send someone to hover over tables while others in your party order food.  It makes for a weird atmosphere, but the food has always been good.  I no longer live in Arizona, but this and a few other restaurants are on my list to try and make sure I make it to when I travel back there.",

My favorites are the bean and cheese burrito and the green corn tamale (I'm a vegetarian, so I can't provide feedback on the meat, but I'm sure it's just as delicious). The tortilla's are handmade pieces of heaven, which you can purchase in bags for your own home-made delights.   Today, I put my order in around 11:30, and the place was practically empty. But within five minutes, it completely filled up, so get there early if you don't want to wait! It took about 15 minutes for my food to come up (2 bean and cheese burritos and a tamale) which wasn't bad. The people watching is interesting enough to keep you entertained until your food is ready. If you're looking for some cheap, tasty Mexican food, and you're in the downtown area, I would definitely recommend Carolina's.",

When I asked the young lady at the counter how they were getting their food before me when I called in 20 minutes prior she said it all depends who takes your order and who is making it... Well as I had an appointment to be at, that is why I called ahead and asked how long it would take, I told her to cancel my order to which she said \"Okay!!\" with a big smile. I sure hope their food quality never gets to low because their customer service won't save them. See them again in a year... well if they are still there.",

On the morning of the pick up, we learned the tile was delayed. I flew into a panic, but Khalid assured me it was on its way. He had the truck deliver the tile to the job site later in the afternoon much to the relief of our contractor from Square Foot Tile!

A place like this will amaze you or leave you feeling let down.  For me it was the latter.    It may not be fair of me to hold the hype factor against Carolina's but it's hard not too.  The food was not bad by any means but it was nothing special compared to Mexican joints elsewhere.  I ordered the beef enchilada and taco meal.  It was good but not great.  I've had better at other Phoenix eateries.  It's on the larger side for a divey Mexican joint but the eating area is drab and lives up to the grimy reputation of hole-in-the-wall restaurants.  This does not bother me in the least as I come for the food but this may be an issue for some.  If you're overly picky about cleanliness be sure to avoid the bathroom.    I won't go out of my way to return to Carolina's but if I find myself in the area again I will be more than happy to drop by, try something else off the menu and see if I can't be swayed to update my review.",

    "text": "Excellent Burritos and tortillas.  I had a Chorizo/Egg/Potato/Bean and a Green Chile and they were both super-tasty.  $7.98 total.  The chorizo is different in a GOOD way than what I have had elsewhere in town.  The spices they use give it almost a \"signature\" taste.  A lot different than most I have had, possibly the tastiest.   It's easy to see why they sell the chorizo uncooked for people to take home - they know they have a winner on their hands.  The green chile is very good too, and very close to Rito's flavor, which I have always considered the best green chile burro in town.  Rito's burros are a little bigger than these though.  I'm going with a big-time thumbs up on Carolina's, a solid 4.5 stars.  Can't wait to go back.....:)  P.S.  UPDATE !!! After going for breakfast here about 10 out of the last 11 weekends, I still LOVE this place.  I normally now eat the Chorizo Tostada for breakfast, and get one of the burritos to take home - any flavor is good.  HOWEVER, I tried one item today that was sub-par and I'd like to warn people about.  The Hard Taco was not good AT ALL.  First, it was one of those taco shells which is not crunchy, and not soft, but kinda.....stretchy?  The meat was shredded beef, and it was greasy with no apparent seasonings.  Quite unexpected from a place where SO many things are GREAT.  Anyway, stay away from THAT one item, but everything else I have tried is great.  P.S. UPDATE NUMBER 2:   The best time to eat at Carolina's is on Saturday.  They have the \"Menudo Fixins\" put out for you to use:  Chopped cilantro, chopped green and white onions, oregano, and red pepper flakes, and lemon wedges.  You don't have to eat menudo to use these fixins, and I like to put them on my tostadas or burros and it really takes the flavors to another plateau.  A must-do.",

They have their awards on the wall for all the times they have been voted Best Tortilla in Phoenix, in case you don't wanna take my word for it.  On to the food. I absolutely LOVE the food here! I have yet to try anything here that I didn't love. The tacos don't come in these pre-shapen, dried out, hard shells like some other places. You can see some of the grease on it form the very recent deep-frying, and it is perfectly crisp without being dried out. The meet is always cooked perfectly. I have never ordered something and been disappointed by dried out meat. Some of my favorite things here are the chimichanga and hard-shell beef tacos, which is shredded beef, not the crappy ground junk that a lot of places use. The Chimichangas have to be my favorite, though. I have never had a chimichanga this great. Be careful, though, because the inside of it is REALLY HOT. You will burn yourself if you don't let it cool a little. I would love to talk about the taste of the food more, but I'm making myself too hungry, so I'll move on.  The best part about Carolina's is the price. You cannot beat the price for the quality of food you get. Tacos are all $0.75, all the time! I guarantee you will be filled up from tacos before you feel like you spent too much on them, and you won't be disappointed with the taste! I can't remember the exact price for the chimichangas, but I do remember that it is much less than you will pay anywhere else, and much more delicious!  The location isn't the best, but who cares. The best stuff is always hard to find! If you don't think it's in a safe area and that is what's deterring you, don't let it. There are cops in and out of there all the time to eat. Plus, nobody wants to pull any crap here because it's just too good!  EDIT: Tacos are not $0.75 anymore. I guess they are up to $2.00 now. New price is disappointing, but this doesn't change my rating because they are still the best tacos around!",

From longsleeved office workers to utility company uniformed types to gold chained and tatooed tough looking chaps, this place has it all.  Fret not because everyone's here for the good food :).   I had a machaca plate and I like it very much.  The beef was nicely cooked, juicy and tender and full of juices.  The tortillas are home made and very elastic.  Yes elastic, cause u can pull on it and it will stretch, it's almost a little rubber band like.  Unlike most tortillas at other places that simply tears off and crumb when u pull on them, this one will flex with your pull :)  I will be back for sure, can't wait to try their green chili burro :)",

The last 6 times that I have placed an order for an event, my order has not been ready by the time I was told. Recently, we ordered dozens of tamales about 5 hours in advance. We arrived and they had forgotten about our order once again. The women at the front, didn't seem to care and never apologized. Half hour later, we were still waiting. We had to cancel the order and called Comedor Guadalajara right down the street. They were amazing and saved the day. I shared this story with many people at the event and it was recommended that I write a Yelp review. It's with great regret that I say I will not go back to Carolinas again.",

I was raised on Mexican food, having lived in the Phoenix area for over 44 years. These are hands down the best tortillas around. Do yourself a favor, stop in and pick up two dozen flour tortillas. A good portion of the first dozen will likely be consumed on your way home. Then don't waste them making burros, rather lay one out on a cookie sheet, spread a sparing quanitity of shredded cheese on one half and fold the bare half over the cheese. Now place under the broiler set to low until a few golden brown blisters appear. Remove and flip the entire  tortilla over and return the the broiler until this side looks like the first. Remove, slice and enjoy a little slice of heaven right there in your very own kitchen... mmmmm... Yep, they're THAT good... Now excuse me, I've gotta make a Carolina's run for a few dozen...",

My review is based on a catering order of breakfast burritos that my company did.  The burritos were poorly labled and was difficult to tell which ones did not have nasty chorizo in them.  The burrito I had a bite of and spat out was a salty, greasy mess.  Of course I picked a burrito with chorizo.  So glad I did not waste any calories on this.",

The tortillas were so thin and the burrito was wrapped so lose that just picking the thing up already had the tortilla ripping. After the first bite I just gave up on picking it up since the bottom had completely ripped open.  I ended up having to eat it with a fork and a knife, which would've been fine if the food was anything special, but the flavor wasn't any better than the chain mexican food I could get anywhere.",

You might ask \"Well, why even offer them?!\"  You're right, but in practice, I think the subset philosophy works well.   Which brings to me to their Machaca. Outstanding. Just outstanding. Machaca mix has t going on. Sometimes the burro is a bit too wet, and sometimes the tortilla is a bit thin and the burro breaks. But even with those, it's still an excellent meal.  Machaca yourself!",

    "text": "So once again, I ordered the wrong thing. I must have. Everyone loves this place, so it must be me. Most Yelp reviews are great (which is why we met there), the people I was with loved their food (a burro & a chimichanga), the various police officers who swiftly came in and out seemed to enjoy their food, but I thought mine sucked! This smarts, particularly because I was so looking forward to eating \"good Mexican in a sketchy neighborhood,\" as I had told my cousin weeks ago was high on the to-do list for our trip to Phoenix.   The barbed wire behind the building, the rugged neighborhood, and the jammed paper towel dispenser in the restroom sure made it seem sketchy enough to be good, but the food disappointed me. So what gives?  Does it serve me right for not ordering off the giant menu on the wall?   I asked if they could make enchiladas verdes and they said yes, so I went for it. The chicken, by the by, was fantastic--very white and tender and it looked great, especially in my cousin's burro, but the sauce on my enchiladas was not green, it was more of a MRSA-discharge yellow. In addition, the sauce was so creamy that it was goopy, it was flavorless, and it was not hot. (Er, it was not hot temperature-wise, nor was it spicy).  My cousin ordered chips and salsa with her burro (an enormous bag), so after I finished picking the chicken out of the enchiladas, I ate some of her chips using my refried beans as a dip. The salsa was good, though, and the kind of spicy that accumulates and sneaks up on you. Also, their pop machine dispenses horchata.  Still, I would not go to Carolina's again.",

FYI the red sauce packs heat so if you don't like spicy, order without this sauce. I happen to enjoy a little flavor kick so it was a pleasant surprise.  The restaurant is set up with a counter to order and pick up with a separate room with tables and chairs to eat. Carry out is offered but no delivery.  When your food is ready they call your order number over a microphone for you to pick up.  Park on the side away from the main road as it may be difficult to get back out. Parking on the main street is only supposed to be for compact cars but I saw several large pick up trucks.  Overall a good experience.",

She provided me with many suggestions. I went with the chicken taco and chicken enchilada. I know. Boring. Wrong!! The taste and texture were amazing. Did I mention, they make fresh tortillas there? People, get out there, relax, enjoy what this restaurant has to offer. I don't give a damn that this is in a bad neighborhood!!!

A Oaxaca burro consists of potatoes, beans, chorizo and cheese, and it's Sonoran bliss.  I also love the red chile burros.  I'm a burro guy so I pretty much stick to anything rolled in a tortilla.    Criticisms:  Seating area sucks.  Inefficient use of existing space (what's up with no seating in that first room area?), that's about it.  Definitely go there.  And give me a call or a PM when you are so I can give you my order.",

The food is amazing... everything is made fresh to order and the tortillas are to die for. The place isn't in the best location but to grab a pick lunch there or early dinner (during the day) is the best. The burritos are so awesome, you just have to try it to understand what us Yelpers are talking about here. This is legitimate GOOD Mexican food, not that Americanized crap that we see all too often.   I you have a stomach, check out Carolina's. I can't imagine anyone having anything bad to say about the deliciousness that's created here... oh yeah and did I mention it's unbelieveably cheap? Yeah, that's right. Go here.",

It's tasty food served up with a side of beans in a building that under other circumstances would be better suited to an auto mechanic. But therein lies the charm. Carolina's seems to consciously embrace chaos by not having queues for customers to maintain an appropriate line and a menu that has seen better days (not to mention, some of the missing prices cause some confusion). It habitates in South Phoenix like a buoy in a hurricane, yet it fits and belongs and to perfectly complement the gritty reputation of its surroundings.   When I used to work at 48th Street and Southern Ave, I would stop by here after calling in my order and treat my coworkers to the most amazing breakfast burritos this side of the border.",

And do yourself a favor and get a order of the fresh tortillas to go. Amazing! At $3/dozen you will not be sorry.

In hind sight I kind of wish I had gone for a burrito (next time I visit I will do that) but I had been craving red chile enchiladas the day I went.    Upon entering I knew not to expect anything fancy about the place, for me it's a non issue that does not even get factored into my evaluation. Knowing I wanted to try a couple of items I ordered a combo of Enchiladas, a crunchy taco with rice and beans, and  I also ordered a tortilla with cheese, to-go.   When I got in I dug into the enchiladas, mehhh they were ok, The sauce was definitely underwhelming (slightly disappointing).  After about 3 bites I decided to dig into the taco.  It was good.  The highlight of the take-away was the tortilla with cheese and the beans in the combo meal.  Oh my!! These were great.  I would go back over and over again for just these 3 things in their various forms.    Yes I will go back but now I have a better idea of what I will try on the next round.",

The green chili plate is also really good (and popular). The prices are super cheap- I ordered a 3-way, chips, salsa and a soft drink for $7. I couldn't finish my plate either- so much food.The house red sauce is awesome, and they serve Pepsi products to drink. Don't expect much from the staff in terms of warm-n-fuzzy.

He told me to get there early for lunch because the line ends up out the door for the rush. This is the information I had and I was stoked to get lunch at a hidden gem in Phoenix that had \"amazing\" Mexican food. I walked into this this little dirty building, everything was old, but it smelled pretty good. I overlooked the cleanliness because of the things I've heard... I ordered a shredded beef chimichangas and my father in law got a carne asada burrito. After a few bites... I felt nothing... I felt like I had been kicked in the sweet spot, or just learned that Santa was not real, or like the Easter bunny was my parents, or that  in fact my ass does look fat in my favorite jeans... I felt lied, deceived, hurt all at the same time. The food was mediocre at best... then it hit me, i'm eating a mediocre chimichanga in a dirty building! I felt like I had left my morals at the door for what I thought was going to be the best Mexican food IN THE WORLD! All I know is my mom and dad would have been disappointed in me for continuing to eat this poor excuse of a chimi, but the would understand seeing as I couldn't return it... The guy that recommended this place and I are no longer friends... Because with friends like that who needs enemies!!! HA!",

The outside of the restaurant doesn't look like much, but walk in here during lunch and you'll witness a cross-section of Phoenix society - old and young, black and white, rich and poor. People of all different walks come here to enjoy the food, and it takes just a few bites to understand why.  My favorites are the red and green sauce burritos and the chorizo/potato burrito. They sell for under four dollars, but they are rather small (think Taco Bell-sized burrito rather than Chipotle size rotund burrito). You can make it a meal with rice and beans for a little bit more. In terms of beverages, I was skeptical of the horchata being dispensed from a fountain drink machine, but it's actually very good. I definitely filled up my cup before leaving to take on the road.",

    "text": "How Good Depends On What You Order.   I have been to Carolina's a few times, after all it's close to where I work.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Carolina's is a small one story white stucco building with barred windows and doors. The side of the building has huge letters spelling out \"Carolina's\".  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entree from a large menu above the windows.    As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel mustard/ketchup pump dispensers.  The hard-shell machaca taco, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas a in the past were amazing. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese, However, the red sauce is  tasty).  Today I ordered the beef tamale plate and to be honest my entree was  pretty awful more fat than beef in the tamale, and the tamales had an overwhelming taste of oil. The meal just wasn't very good.  It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's.",

Carolinas has been here forever and is an institution.  I see they have several other locations but this is the only one I've visited so I can't speak for the others.  Odd place you have to sneak out to but do what you have to do to get there.  Prices are beyond reasonable and the tortillas are super fresh as they make them right there.  Takes a bit of a wait as the place is always full and only one person taking orders.  Seating sucks as the furniture looks like it came out of the original Taco Bell.  Hard modular seating and in a room that looks like the paint still has a good amount of lead in it.  Don't care though as there #13 always rings my bell.  Another constant is that they could really use a water filter on their fountain drink machine because the water in Phoenix is not very good.",

While mostly all their food is still rock solid, it seems like every employee got a memo that said if you ask for any potato in a burrito, then make sure you put 99% potato and 1% anything else. I am not over exaggerating here. This is like the 5th time or more where I have ordered a Oaxaca burro and a full baked potato with a chaser of beans and chorizo. This is not how it used to be but it is definitely not a one off occasion.  I buy like 6 burros at a time. The last visit my wife got a chorizo,egg,bean, and potato, enchilada style. Her meal was all potato, I ordered two Oaxaca burros to go, both of them were almost all potato. If I hadnt got the 3 way burro I would have not had anything that wasnt garbage. You guys need to fix your crap, this cant be only me getting the raw end of the stick here, fix whatever is wrong with portioning in a damn burro.",

My go to is the chorizo and potato plate, but I've had quite a number of their offerings and have never been disappointed. Anything with their house made chorizo is great.  One other tip: You can buy both their tortillas and chorizo (uncooked) to take home ... and you should.",

So on the outside the place looks scary,  on the inside the place looks scary  I've read many reviews about Carolinas & decided it was the perfect day for a burrito.    The parking lot is very small lucky me I had my grandpa with me & used his special parking privilege.  I wheel him in & he picks the chorizo and egg burrito right away! He tried to get me to pick the same as him but the Machaca with egg was calling my name.    The line was very long but it moved quickly I was surprised to see such a wide-range of customers from police officers, construction workers and men in professional suits.  I knew we were in for a treat.    The tortilla was thin, warm and fresh it was pretty big, but grandpa almost ate the whole burrito he must have been real hungry.  He said it reminded  him of his mothers tortillas that she use to make   and these were the best he's ever had from a restaurant!! What a compliment !! He actually said it was beautiful !! WTF grandpa beautiful ?? Was he taking to his burrito or me,  funny I didn't know a burrito could be beautiful and I thought he was giving me a compliment JK.    My Machaca & egg was delicious ! The meat was tender and juicy.  I don't really eat bread so I can't comment on the tortilla but I'll take grandpas word for it.   Not really liking that the hot sauce is in a ketchup container but that's ok we got some to go & it was yummy !!   It's not fancy & not in a great neighborhood,  but if your in the area and are in the mood for authentic Mexican food I'd say give it a try.    Enjoy",

There is nothing fancy about it so please don't come in your Sunday best. Mainly this is a spot for you to swing by on your lunch break or on your way to or from work. I see cops and business locals here all the time. Any foodie local knows this is the spot. Many a times I have swung by after work to pick up a huge 32oz tub of enchilada sauce for dinner. It's about $10 but it lasts at least throught two different meals and it saves me time from having to make my own or (God Forbid!) have me crack open a can thing of bitter mess.  Try anything here once. Maybe to go and not dine in, this please is really not asthetically pleasing, but it's up to you.",

The restaurant's skin has been pockmarked by bullets and its windows and doors outfitted with heavy metal security bars.\"  I decided I've been to worse (downtown Cincinnati) and that there was a nice mix of clientele so I gathered my cash and my camera and crossed the threshold. The floor was concrete, the walls chipped and dirty and the atmosphere...authentic. I felt like I was in Mexico. I stared at the menu but I already knew I wanted...Machacha and Eggs (recommended on Yelp). I was extremely relieved when I got to the counter and the young girl taking my order spoke perfectly clear English, so asking questions was easy. You order, you get a number, you wait, you eat. Easy enough.  Oh and cash only!  After making my order, I wandered into the large, adjoining room to find a seat. It was just as shabby and the atmosphere buzzed with chatter. Carolina's is best known for its flour tortilla - a large, delicately thin and slightly chewy affair that makes the most elegant wrap for the restaurant's divine burro.  The tortillas, which are available by the dozen for takeout, are churned out by a crew of workers who stand before a bank of hot griddles, deftly flipping the paper thin rounds of dough and piling them up for packaging. So I had a machaca and egg burrito and a taco. The burrito was yummy, the tortilla soft, but I'm so glad I got that taco. The shell was so crunchy, so fresh, so good. I really want another Carolina taco.",

Who would ever make a burrito with just a couple small pieces of meat and sauce?!! I was extremely disappointed. The ONLY reason I gave it one star is because the buttered tortilla was tasty. But it was exactly what it sounds like, butter on a wadded up tortilla. Why am I paying almost $2 for butter on a tortilla?!  I would probably not give this place another chance.

I spent 30 mins calling while the phone rang & rang. I even called the other locations to ask if Mohave was closed & they said only the Cactus one was closed for remodeling. So needing my fix I drove all the way to Carolina's on Mohave & the place is open and not busy at all. I asked one of the many workers who were just standing behind the counter if I was dialing the right number then the chick tells me \"oh they told us not to answer phones\". Carolina's you almost lost me to La Canasta for good!!!",

    "text": "My time in Phoenix wasn't going to be complete without some Mexican food.  It didn't have to be \"authentic,\" just a local's eatery.  I was already tired of the airport Mexican food, so instead of venturing straight there on my way out, I took a 20 minute detour to visit the city's top rated Mexican joint, none other than the infamous Carolina's.  Ever have that uneasy feeling of \"I don't know about this...\" while exploring a new neighborhood?  This was exactly one of those times.  I already knew it was a dive, but I didn't know it was going to be a scene from the movies, almost as if Compton was ever smack dab in the middle of desert.  Even when we questioned our GPS directions, it never lead us astray.  Within a few minutes into a ghost town of project like homes, we found Carolina's.  There wasn't any windows, some minor graffiti, looking something like a warehouse with a bare parking lot.  The doors were painted black on an all white building, I was just waiting to open the doors to find bikers and extras from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.  Instead, I found a mix of patrons from all social classes, some waiting in line, and many sitting quietly enjoying their meal.  After a quick peak at the menu, I noticed nothing was in Spanish.  The guys behind the counter were all speaking flawless English and then I realized none of the clientele was Hispanic.  Could access to decent Mexican food be any easier?  I decided to ask the guys behind the counter for things that weren't on the menu and they jokingly retorted, \"Go to Mexico, this is Carolinas.\"  The entire menu reminded me of the fast food Mexican joints (a la Muchas Gracias in Oregon) I've seen throughout the west coast, thought he prices weren't as dirt cheap as I had hoped but still a good deal nonetheless.  Without abandon, I ordered a mix of enchiladas, tacos, tamales, and their infamous tortillas that were made in house.  In short, I did not come away disappointed.  The tamales were fresh, steaming away as I unwrapped the corn husks.  A quick cut into the masa revealed the fine starch hugging the bits of shredded chicken just perfectly and spiced with the perfect amount of salsa verde.  They were good enough for me to consider ordering a second one, but I was on a limited time frame.  The hard shelled taco was totally what I was used to back home - deep fried, packed, and super greasy - producing an unmistakable crunch without falling apart.  The enchiladas were drenched in a salsa roja sauce, meshed with a bed of frijoles and cheese.  This was greasy Mexican at it's finest, the kind where artery salvation was never part of the agenda, sinful with every bite.  A surprising thumbs up goes to their tortillas, simple yet hearty.  The tortillas con queso were undoubtedly cheesy and though nothing like the ones I've eaten in Mexico, were worth their weight in saturated fat.  If I somehow warrant more visits to Phoenix, I can see myself coming out here for my greasy Mexican fix.  I still need to try their burritos, flautas, chimis, and tostadas.  If I like what I see and more importantly what I taste, I might be able to award this lil dive another whole star.",

    "text": "I am really torn about this place. It has all the markings of a top notch food joint. Hole-in-the-wall characteristics that gives it a certain \"feel\" of authenticity. I've been to Mexico several times and the best tacos ive ever had were from street vendors, not the restaurant adjacent to the (insert touristy hotel here).  So i had high hopes, and everyone told me if i wanted legit mexican food in Phoenix, this is where you roll to.  The pricing is unbeatable, especially for the portion sizes.  So i get the salsa/hot sauce, and its great. I went here right before close so ill give them a pass, but the tortilla chips were no bueno. They just tasted like bulk chips you would get from taco bell or something like that. Or like some bulk generic chip bag from Sams Club. Enough with crappy analogies, they just weren't that good. So on to the tacos... The crispy tacos were ON POINT! Amazing, great flavor, crispy shell, exactly what i had hoped for. Some of the best crispy tacos id ever had (in mexico i had only seen and eaten soft tacos). The soft tacos were good but way to soggy. Like you would take a bite and the soft shell would disintegrate in your hand. So why if the chips sucked and the soft tacos were sub par do i give it 4 stars? The chips, its like who cares. If i go to red lobster and the rolls arent warmed all the way, im not bashing the whole meal.  And for the soft tacos, im not sure what was up with those. But from some of the other dishes i tried with the party i was with everything else seemed fantastic. So.... you need to go here.... just lower your expectations on soggy soft tacos.",

It's not \"authentic\" in a LA food truck or tacqueria way, but more like your Mexican grandmother's kitchen (if you had a Mexican grandmother).  I think they put crack in the tortillas; usually the tortillas are just a vessel/carrying case for tastiness, but the tortillas here are amazing. The stuff inside is great too and the hot sauce is typical Mexican. Thumbs up!  Especially the Machaca.",

As the employee was taking my order, I could tell they were very annoyed with me, possibly because I had a large order.  When I was done reading off the twelve orders, I kindly asked the employee if they could repeat the order to make sure we didn't miss anything.  At this point, the employee pulls the phone away and says \"oh my god!\".   Obviously I heard and asked \"is my large order annoying you?\"  The response was \"oh no, I was talking to a friend.\"  When I went in to pick up my order I asked to speak to a manager.  A woman walks up and asks if she can help me.  I explained what happened and she said she would find out who took my order and talk to her manager about it so that they can \"talk to the employee about it\".  Not once did she apologize for the horrible service. Needless to say, I will never be ordering from this place again.",

They have both coke and pepsi products...so that's good.  Overall I'd say good.  Not the best, but good.  I guess it all depends on what you come here for.  Some things (tortillas and price for instance) are as good as you can find.  Other things (beans) are just average.  Going with a 4 but because of the drive I have to make to get there its somewhere between a 3 and a 3.5.",

But when it comes right down to it, it's all a matter of opinion.  When it comes to Carolina's Mexican Food, mine differs from most.  I've mentioned in other reviews that I love the idea of a mom-n-pop place where local owners are doing their own thing, contributing to the local economy with jobs and paying their taxes.  Plus, this place makes their own tortilla shells. so that's a nice touch.  The food isn't especially memorable.  The machaca or chicken tacos are appropriately sized overall, but contain mostly just iceburg.  See for yourself with the posted pics.  The chicken was flavorless, but the machaca was a bit easier to discern.  Also, the size of the cheese quesadilla was fine, though proportionately had little cheese.  In the interest of safety, I would NOT recommend coming here at night alone.  If you must, be sure you're with a group of people and at least one or two of you have sobered after a night of drinking.  This place is OK for taking care of the munchies.  Just be sure you're careful to be safe in this less-than-stellar neighborhood.",

To top that off, all the fuss about their tortillas is True. They were extremely good. I liked that they were super thin and humongous. I even ended up buying a dozen of them (only $4).  I'm looking forward to introducing some of my friends to this place. It's cheap, delicious and very satisfying.",

I ordered 4 breakfast burritos.  3 of them with Chorizo, egg, potato and beans. And 1 with with machaca. The burritos were small and pricey but very good. The potatoes were a tad hard so maybe needed a little more cooking but overall burrito was great. My brother had the machaca burrito and he was raving at how good it was. It definitely had alot of meat so they didn't skimp. The tortillas are hand made so definitely enhanced the taste. They also sell handmade flour tortillas for you to take home. Might have to pick me up a few dozen to take back to California.  Overall was satisfied with the food as they have a great breakfast.  The place itself was very busy and looked a bit messy. I took our food to go so can't comment on the location ambience.  Recommended!",

Not like this place is still a secret, which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere.   I should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting. But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's. I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions. The problem is, I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito, so I just end up getting both. And finishing both. And it's not even difficult!   These have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here. I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC, just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist! It's just all, sadly, located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal, or in actual Mexico).   The wait to order is never very long, but the wait to get your food does seem endless. It's only because they make everything fresh to order, though! And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food, and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive.   They have something here that I have never seen before...a Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain! And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas. So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi, they've got it all covered.   I could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place, but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP! And if you're heading to NYC, bring me some tortillas! :)",

Prefacing our wolfing session, he informed me the meal might not be the greatest, but how the tortillas were the absolute bomb. He said they were the best in the valley, and how when he was in line to pickup the order, several people were there for only tortillas.  Everything he said was accurate. My red chile was ok, nothing special. Refried beans, above average.  The tortillas?  Unbelievable. Growing up in south Phoenix, and having a plethora of Hispanic friends whose mom's all made homemade tortillas, Carolina's took me back to those happy days when mom sent me out into the hood looking for my father every weekend.  I almost always found him at the Granillo residence, slurping menudo, drinking beer and eating Mrs Granillo's tortillas, which were the best in the hood. Carolinas reminded me of Mrs Granillo, my dad, and my mother yelling at him for coming home drunk. That is until he whipped out some of Mrs Granillo's tortillas, then she lost her mind and all was forgiven.  If you go to Carolinas, order a dozen flour tortillas, and eat one or two. Then go out clubbing and get sloppy drunk. When your wife presses for where you've been all night, whip out the tortillas. They'll save your bacon. I know this first-hand.",

The lines can get crazy at times, but it is a popular place by all.  You cannot go wrong by visiting this place and sampling the food. Take some tortillas with you, too, if you get the chance.",

    "text": "Well everyone here is gai for Carolina's, so am I and I am thrilled that they opened a 2nd restaurant in my neck of the woods (Cave Creek and Cactus) because I don't go down by the airport that much.  As others have stated, however, the original location has a lot of, shall we say, local color. A little too much for me. I felt like I was eating at a prison cafeteria; hell, a prison cafeteria probably has more ambience and is cleaner.  On the few occasions I find myself going that way, I do take-out. I regularly buy tortillas by the dozen from them, they beat the hell out of supermarket-bought tortillas. The Cave Creek/Cactus location is a lot cleaner and in a much safer part of town, I have no problem eating in at that location.",

The best explanation we could come up with was a Goodwill version of Taco Bell. Obviously a lot of people really enjoy it, but it is definitely one Mexican restaurant we will never think about eating at again. If there's a Cafe Rumba or Revo burrito in your area, hit either of those instead. They will knock your socks off!",

    "text": "In a town with a lot of great Mexican food, Carolina's sits at the top.  I have eaten my way through most of the menu, and determined that my personal favorite is the Machaca Burrito (enchilada style).  The wife craves their Chorizo/Potato burrito.  Anything that has a flour tortilla as and ingredient here is wonderful.  That is their specialty.  We always get a half dozen to take home for later.  Something really special (if not particularly healthy) is their flour tortilla with butter.  Their salsa is wonderful as well (and goes well with everything).  I would bathe in tub full of the stuff if I could get enough of it (I always take a small tub or two home with me to go with the tortillas).  Carolina's always, always has a line out the door (but don't worry, it moves quick - and if you are in a real hurry, you can call ahead).  Tasting their food, I understand why.",

I like the fact they give generous portions and you can buy their home made tortillas and other items in quantities to take home and prepare it to fool your guests....did I say that out loud?
