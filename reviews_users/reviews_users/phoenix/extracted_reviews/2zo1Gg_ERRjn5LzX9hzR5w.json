I love their pizza because not only is it thin but it's also topped generously. Given, I do pay to add the extra cheese but still, I don't like biting into plain dough and even without the extra it's still good. As far as price, I've only ordered from Grubhub so it is a bit pricey. Don't expect to leave with anything below $20, but I feel it's worth it. Ive always had my food within 30-45 mins. As far as dessert, I opt only for the chocolate chip brownie...its delicious! It's a fudge-type brownie so it has a bit more texture than just a regular brownie, but maybe it has to do with the refrigeration system. I won't lie and say that every order has been perfect, because it hasn't, but for the most part I've always had an 8/10+ experience every time.",

    "text": "My family loves clockwork pizza. The Slice app could be a little more intuitive but that's not on CP. we love that this pizza has a thinner crust. My daughter absolutely loves the Garlic Knots, they are super good, expect a lot of Parmesan sprinkled on top of them. The pizzas are not overly saucy but they are very generous with the toppings. My husband said the Honey medium wings are really good as well. When you order through the app you can pay online so it's a very quick in/out when you get the pizza. It is a very small shop designed for takeout primarily though they have a couple small tables for you to wait at or possibly eat a slice.  Be sure to ch do the whole app to find the coupons/specials there's pretty much always a deal to be found.",

Now, what really sets this apart are the wings.  The wings are my favorite hands down.  I normally like hot or BBQ, but plain here is hard to pass up.  Flavorful and crunchy without being over done.  Juicy inside!",

The person answering the phone is always courteous and friendly and they have your address on file if you have ordered with them in the past - they know it right away by your phone number when you call.   They actually took my order 20 minutes before they close which is awesome for a pizza place; most places deny you if you do not order within 45 minutes of closing time. At least that has been my experiences with other pizza joints in my neighborhood including Gus' Pizza.   The pizza itself is great and the dough and toppings are fresh. Their prices are reasonable to and the pizza is better than something you would get from a dominoes or Papa John's.   Their delivery time is also pretty fast.   This is definitely my go to pizza place.",

They are fast, reliable and when we order online, seem nearly always to get the details right, (no onions, extra mayo, etc.). Have enjoyed subs, gyros, salads, desserts, and fries or chips visiting kids numerous times.  They have us covered for snacks, (Oreos, snickers, monster, Gatorade) we don't keep around the house, when there are hungry kids over with friends. Great customer service, and very good subs ( Italian, ham and turkey are favorites) and other items above.  As they are our go-to delivery for very casual food, it must be said that with their strengths, we have learned over several tries to entirely skip the wings, surprisingly even the kids, (just too much vinegar, too little flavor), and the pizza.  The small pizzas are consistently sodden. Medium thick dough, undercooked every time, are just a mess, and they go uneaten.  Requested well done, and then thinner and well done but had the same undercooked really awful result.  The dough just doesnt get cooked.  It's just bad.  We don't think of them as a pizza place, but do think of them as terrific for good delivery, sandwiches salads snacks desserts.  Kids love the brownie, friends like chocolate mousse cake, the very light if untraditional Tiramisu is a favorite.",

    "text": "The only pizza I've eaten prior to this regularly  is nasty chain pizza so keep that in mind when I say this is the best pizza I've ever had thus far. I'm not quite sure what to name the style other than f'in amazing. Having alot of cheese on it, I expected it to be rather greasy but surprisingly it wasn't really greasy at all. While the pepperonis were a little greasy, it's definitely acceptable when they appear to be really fresh (you'll notice the deep red color too). You'd really just have to try it yourself because it's so much more different than what's readily available out here.   The wings too, my god, are amazing as well. Even though a place like buffalo wild wings is known simply for their wings, they can't compare with Clockwork's meaty and well sauced wings. Whatever fat is on the wing is minimal and doesn't impede the enjoyment at all. There's just enough sauce to be able to dip your wing in the little puddles in the box. Only downside: just one ranch per 10 wings. Then again, I had no problem enjoying the wings by themselves.  Food aside, the employees (which I think are all family, or at least closely connected) are all very nice. When waiting outside for my pizza, one of the employees brought my food out to me and wished me a good night.   The environment is very nice for what appears to be a low-traffic strip mall. LCD TV on the wall for the table inside and a few tables outside. Clean and neat sums it up well.   The taste alone has kept me coming back since I started with them just a week ago thanks to an ad on my door (who would have thought that stuff worked ha), but the prices slaughter the chain pizza shops, especially once you factor in quality of food.",

I asked to speak to a manager. 1st off, the \"manager\" told me I should have noticed the bill was oddly high when I ordered. Not the way for her to handle it in my opinion. I would have left it at that but then the girl was rude & to hang up with me said, \"I'm busy, bye\". Ten minutes later I called back and asked to speak to the manager, again. The girl hung up on me almost immediately. The third time I called and asked for the manager -the \"manager\" was now a man. He accused me of being racist (15+ times) without knowing my race. He refused to tell me the owner's name or corporate number. I finally found out who the owner was by looking up the business license through the state of Arizona's public records. I went in to the restaurant to speak to him about the incident. He started coming up with excuses for their behavior. He said she was under a lot of stress. As for the man, he admitted it was his brother, and I quote, he said, \"my brother, he's a little crazy\". His brother was upset because they were busy and I was calling in. The owner also told me I should have called back later and not that night when I noticed the bill was wrong. Eventually, he admitted that the woman was his wife. Then, he said the reason she was short with me was that their 7 month old who was behind the counter in the area with the ovens had just hit her head. Therefore, she had to go check on the baby. My response to all of this was that it could have been handled differently. She could have said there is an emergency I need to go. His brother could have apologized for her and tried to help me himself. Then I said all I would like them to do is apologize for being rude to me when I called in with a question, not demanding a refund or trying to be rude. I still wasn't looking for a refund or free pizza. I, as a costumer, wanted to be treated with respect when I speak to employees. He took down my name and number and said he would have them call to apologize. That was last week. I have not received an apology or heard from them since. I am shocked that a small, local business, whom I was trying to help support, would treat a customer like this. Thank you for your time.",

They have only one seat inside and three little dirty seats outside. I was traveling with two children and this place wouldn't even let them use the restroom. I guess I should have read a few more reviews before I decided upon this pizza joint. The menu is way different than the one they show on line and the food is not at all what I expected. Well better luck next time. Hope your experience is more exciting than mine.",

The food was inconsistent at first but after March, I tried it again, off-handedly, and it was spot on and it's been spot on ever since. Zero complaints, even the driver's are 90% on time if not early. (noticed one younger man who usually is late but I tend to just avoid those days he works according to my patterns.) Keep up the good work, if this is the 'only' delivery option that you have in the area, you can do MUCH MUCH worse. Consistent, quality, doesn't skimp on topping and temperature is on spot 9/10. Thanks for the great service.  High quality items, Calzones, GARLIC CHEESE BREAD IS ZE BEST in the valley if you ask me, Pizzas.  Med quality items - wings bones/bonless... found the same. The sauce is a bit harsh and very arroatic (if you like that, I prefer temp and flavor usually) seems a bit off on texture. Tried 3 different kinds, still the same.   Low quality items - nothing",

I ended up ordering from clockwork pizza. It came super fast even with how the weather was, the guy was very nice and my order was all there.   I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half gyro meat. It was very good. I finally found a pizza place that I can get the pizza with marinara, normally (at other places) I get light sauce, no sauce, or buffalo sauce instead of marinara because the flavor is overbearing or tangy. Clockworks marinara is definitely to my liking, yay!  Also got the Italian salad which was the best I have had in a long time! Even compared to Italian restaurants, such as Rigatony's, that tend to not give you many toppings in the salad. This salad had so much meat and cheese, as well as other topping like banana peppers, bell peppers, and onions.   Very happy with my experience and will definitely order again :).",

She said the pizza would be there \"as soon as possible...\" and we got it almost exactly an hour later, which was a little disappointing.

They also had fabulous prices on a special board outside. The Greek Salad I ordered was advertised to have romaine lettuce, however there  was only iceberg lettuce beneath the noticeably canned toppings. I'd definitely pass on the salad next time. Additionally, I ordered a 2 liter pop that was not given in my order to go. Apparently, although the beverages are not in the waiting area, it is expected for you to go behind the counter and take matters into your own hands. When I called in to inquire about it the manager said, \"I thought you got it\". Yummy pizza, poor customer service.",

The staff was very friendly, and most importantly, my food was tasty! I ordered pizza and breadsticks. You shouldn't be disappointed here. Also, it smelled like really fresh French fries when I walked in. Definitely plan on trying them soon!",

    "text": "I just moved to the area 3 days ago, I have now eaten at Clockwork twice. The first time I had their slice, salad & drink special for $5. Tonight I ordered a large calzone. First let me start by saying, I am from Chicago, so I would consider myself a pizza aficionado. Their pizza was the best I have had in the 4 years I have been in AZ, hands down. It's a thin crust, sliced NY style.  The \"side\" salad is a nice size with a generous amount of toppings. Every bite was more than just lettuce.  Tonight I had the large deluxe calzone for $10, it's a monsterous size and enough for 3 meals. They slice it into strips so you can eat it without utensils. (Which was nice for me since I have no idea what box my silverware is in!) It was also extremely delicious.  Overall, the food is outstanding and the portion sizes are generous, great value for the money. I will be eating there alot!!",

The pie is hot, the salad is chilled, and the Coke is ice cold.  I typically order the Pendulum White Pizza. I don't eat meat or poultry and the combination of ingredients on the Veggie Pizza aren't my favorites, so when I'm not in the mood for the Pendulum White, I order a Cheese Pizza with my choice of one or two ingredients.  The unfavorable reviews of Godfather's Pizza seem suspicious to me. They're too laconic to be earnest critiques of the food or the service. Conversely, the favorable reviews are generally thoughtful, thorough, and descriptive. To me, they seem written to be genuinely helpful and are therefore more trustworthy.",

As far as the ingredients, I've had three of their pizzas.  Simply pepperoni, a Green Pepper, Onion, and Sausage, and their BBQ Chicken pizza.   Firstly, the pepperoni.  As far as their sauce and cheese, it was more or less on the bland side, but the pepperoni was nice and crisp on the edges.  It's kind of hard to screw up a pepperoni.  So the pepperoni wasn't so bad. Next, the sausage, onion, and green pepper.  My take on their sausage; buy something else.  It's awful rubbery cheap little globules.  If I had a recommendation for the owner;  get like the progressive privately owned pizza places in the valley and buy from the Schreiner's.   Otherwise, if you're not buying quality you're wasting your customers time.   In terms of the BBQ chicken pizza, I definitely stress the quality of cooking this correctly, because Clockwork isn't.  First, I don't know if it was because of the cook that night or what, but the dough was not done, pretty much ruining the whole thing.  The BBQ was too sweet, and the chicken to top it off was cheap and had lots of cartiledge.    I think that if Clockwork started buying more quality ingredients they would be a better than average joint, but there are numerous factors holding them back.",

But, LC doesn't deliver.  I did not like the wings.  They had no crispiness and I like wings a little crispy.  The bread-sticks were decent but again, LC has a better bread stick.  I would recommend the sandwiches here.  They are better than the pizzas!",

The workers were nice and easy going. Overall it was ok.   I went back for a second time and tried the calzone. Got to be honest it did not blow my socks off. I was looking forward to a great calzone and it just did not do it for me. Most likely I will not be going back, there are just better places to get pizza.",

The pizza was ready on time when I showed up to pick it up. They helped me load it all up into the car and the pizza looked and tasted AWESOME!

Now, this place is very small so done in is very limited.  They have one table and a bar shelf for 3.  We ordered 2 kinds of pizza and bone in wings.    They brought us boneless wings by accident.  It was ok and my family and I was ok to eat them but they were quick to correct the order and brought us the right wings at no charge.  The service was tight and on point.  We will order from them again for sure.  Oh yeah... the brownie.. I saw previous reviews that said the brownie was rock hard...well that is because it was cold.  The refrigerate them so they stay fresh.  By the end of our meal the brownie was warmer, softer and chewy.  So yummy!",

I even remember having low expectations thinking that no place that serves gyros could possibly serve a decent slice of pizza. And I was right. Clockwork pizza does not make a decent pie; they make a phenomenal one. I was absolutely blown away when I took my first bite of pizza. High quality mozzarella, a delicious and complementary sauce, all atop a nice well done flaky crust to boot.  From the outside Clockwork looks like any other pizza shop, but inside is an exciting welcoming atmosphere that seems to always be busy. That being said no matter how busy they are, whether it be the owner or his wife, there is always someone inside to greet you with a smile and GENUINE hospitality. I've been many places where a hostess has greeted me with a smile and are doing there job, maybe they will ask how your day is going, but they don't actually care. It's nice and appreciated , but always seems to be surfes level. Not with the winners of clockwork. My problems are their problems and I am saving a ton money on a therapist because I can just talk out my problems with them.  The prices at clockwork pizza are very competitive for a regular pizza and the deals that they have for their lunch specials are unbeatable. A giant slice 6 wings and a beverage all for 8 dollars? Are you kidding me? I leave them a tip most times because it feels like I am robbing them otherwise!  The inside is very modern and has a cute up to date look to it. The whole business seems to be transparent, you can see the whole kitchen from the waiting area. I've been places and even worked at places that didn't want you to see what goes in behind the scenes but this place not only allows it, but invited you to see how the pizza is made. It's always clean as can be and I've never had a single complaint about the interior, the atmosphere, the food, or the people. I couldn't have asked for a better pizza shop on my block. I don't want this place to be any more busy, but I couldn't go another day without letting the world know how impressed I am and have been with this place.",

I don't know what the heck is going on with CW but the last 3 pizzas I ordered were disappointedly disgusting. The cheese and toppings tasted old and sour. Their garlic knots are hit or miss. The last time I ordered the knots they were raw in the center. Their traditional wings are amazing, their boneless wings are gross. The last time I ordered their boneless wings I received what looked like chicken strips with hot wing sauce on it.   I used to love Clockworks. Now that they're \"Nosh\", or whatever they changed their name to, the food is trash. Order at your own risk.   Clockworks, if you see this PLEASE get it together and go back to making great tasting amazing food!",

I got the garlic knots that smelled slightly better than they tasted (they were a little more bland than I expected, but otherwise good) and had a little more oil than necessary and a small Godfather clock pizza (which was all good, except the olives were a little off). I appreciated that the pizza came with a free side of ranch and all this together was just a little over $11 with tax.  They have slice specials in-store, too, that look to be a pretty good deal.   Mostly, nothing too terribly special to write home about. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I definitely would choose it over some of the other options in the area, especially now that Papa John's has decided that a few cents per pizza is too much to pay for health insurance for his employees.  I'm much happier supporting local anyway.",

It is the best pizza we've found in the area with unique flavors and outstanding customer service. This pizza rocks!    It's our third or fourth time ordering from here and our new favorite pizza is their white pizza. If you have it, you will be addicted too. The pizza has tons of mozzarella cheese and what I think is ricotta cheese beneath the cheesy layer. There are sweet tomatoes on top with spring of spinach. Is it weird that I like the cheese bubbles that sometimes form on top? I love them and always pick the piece with these crispy, tasty morsels.   We live close by so pick up our pizza. It's faster than delivery we think.   Glad we found this local pizzeria. We will obviously keep getting our pizza fix on here!",

    "text": "I LOVE me some Clockwork Pizza. I will be very sad when I move out of the delivery area. I'm a big fan of the Green Time Veggie Pizza, which I always add pepperoni, bacon or ham to (like the carnivorous savage that I am). Plain pepperoni is deeeelicious too. The caesar salad is great, and the dressing is better than the caesar I've had at many a swanky sit-down restaurant. The wings come in excellent flavors. BBQ Hot and Sweet Chili are especially lovely. I've seen a handful of reviews complaining that the wings are small and \"burned\". Small, maybe... but burned? No. No, SIR. I've never had any of their sandwiches but the day will come I'm sure. The garlic knots are alright but not my cup of tea really. I'd pick the plain cheese bread over the garlic bread and be plenty happy. Believe it or not the plain cheese bread dipped in marinara is a world apart from the cheese pizza.   The only orders from Clockwork that I've ever been disappointed with are the calzones and the spinach tomato cheese bread, which arrived soggy. Still, I will stand by my 5 star rating til day that a restaurant delivers me a calzone and/or topping heavy cheese bread that DOESN'T arrive soggy from heat and condensation during travel. No restaurant I've ever ordered from has ever managed to pull off a hot and crispy order of said items without the breads reverting back to dough during transportation. Until the day an establishment delivers me a perfect (in-restaurant quality) calzone, Clockwork remains the 5 star king, queen and whole d*mn royal family of my pizza and pizza adjacent cravings. LONG LIVE THE CLOCKWORK!",

The food arrived fresh and I was surprised that they cater to diet needs like the paleo, keto and gluten free.  I went with the veggie pizza and the pizza was pretty good. I like olives in my pizza and it had a good amount of it. The crust seemed perfect, it was not too thin or thick. It was definitely a decent pizza.  The wings was the surprising element of the foods we ordered. It was so tiny and barely looked like chicken wings. The flavor was good but it lacked the fulfillment of having a chicken wing.   I am not sure of the price range here, cause it was ordered for the team. Overall an alright food experience.",

No complaints - it's fairly inexpensive and not gourmet, but it's not professing to be - it's solid comfort barfood type of fare, so get your order delivered, grab some beers from the fridge, and enjoy a movie!",

The pick up went very smoothly and the guy behind the counter was very friendly (I think it was the same guy).

I remember about 3 months ago i ordered 4 large pizzas and the lady who took my order gave me the best deal for only 34 bucks. I mean come on dude you are getting HALAL chicken pizza in Tempe for so cheap.  So all jokes aside i would recommend the pizza to anyone because they are pretty good.

The first item was a large calzone with; chicken, bacon, and garlic. I have ordered calzones from a lot of places in the area and this was by far the best. It was quite large with generous portions of all the ingredients, for less than what most others in the area charge for a pitifully small calzone. The marinara was a bit bland but that was easily fixed.   Next I had an order of 10 boneless wings in bbq hot. I was surprised with how large each one was, the smallest one was an inch around and about an inch and a half long, most were much bigger. The sauce was tasty and generous, but for me was more of a mild. As others have said the ranch that comes with it is good.  Last I got their garden salad with greek dressing. I recommend getting extra dressing because it's a large salad with a lot of toppings. I got 2 extra containers by ordering extra. Everything in the salad was very crisp and fresh, and the dressing was very good.   I ordered at 8:50 on a Saturday night and got everything about 30 minutes later. All in all I'm going to be coming back quite often and seeing what else they have.",

They cook their pizza with some type of garlic in their sauce or something so garlic lovers, you will love this place. And try a gyro if you want something other than pizza.

Their crust is light and crispy (doesn't go soggy while they drive it to your door!) Plus, the prices are decent and the delivery is fast.  I have never eaten in the restaurant so I can't comment there.  Garlic knots are amazing! Pizza is fresh and delicious.  Their crust is just how I prefer it and the sauce is tangy. Cheesy bread (we've tried the tomato cheese and the Jalapeno cheese) are heavenly. Salads are fresh and crispy and they keep the salad separate from the warm items so it doesn't go limp.  I LOVE this extra precaution. The clock theme they have for the pizza names is pretty creative (Godfather, Alarm, etc.)  The website is easy to use to place your order, and the delivery guys have all been super friendly and efficient.  If you're tired of chain pizza, don't want to pay the premium price for Venezia's, or just want to try something new in the area, I highly recommend them.  The ONLY criticism I have is the first time we ordered from them, I asked for ranch and the ranch tasted like that Kraft stuff.  Kind of gross.  The last time we ordered, though, they gave us ranch even though we didn't order it, and it tasted like the homemade stuff you expect from a pizza place, so I did not remove a star.  Ranch is important to me.  Give them a try!",

Whatever you call it, it was really good pizza.  When I order again, I will likely ask to have the pizza cooked a little longer as I like my crust a little crispier - but again - what I got this go round was excellent.

When the food arrived the driver and i had a good laugh becuase it had just started to rain when they were pulling up. The food was hot and tasted really good.   Havent had a bad experience yet. Will definitely be on my list of go to places for pizza.",

Lunch specials are ok, pricing is too high because they only give you a can of soda with it rather than a fountain drink like normal. Seriously, get that fixed. Location is SMALL. Only 3 tables that share the lobby, I'm not going outside in AZ! Don't plan to come with many people. Best items on the menu weren't pizza, their fries and garlic knots were KILLER and well priced too.",

    "text": "The main reason for the perfect star review is not only great tasting pizza, but their commendable consistency in taste, customer service, and time.   Imagine this: A lactose-intolerant foodie craving some good hearty pizza on a Friday night. Sounds crazy doesn't it? But it DOES happen folks! I'm here to tell you that I am living proof of the scenario described above. But what's a gal to do when she can't eat that ooey-gooey-melt-in-your-mouth-what-makes-a-good-pizza CHEESE!? I'll tell ya what; she goes to Clockwork!   Let me tell you this IRL story. So I get off work, it's 5pm on a Friday and like I said, my stomach's growling \"pizza, pizza, pizza!\" I ring up my good old buddies at clockwork, (such good buddies that I have them saved in my contacts... Yea, that's right), and I say \"hey dudes, I need a godfather pizza, XL, and hold the cheese!\" And you know what the cool part is? They don't even question it! They're just like alright, cool. And that's that! Other pizza places just give you an awkwardly judgmental silence on the phone and say \"wait, no cheese??\" So discriminatory!   Anyway - 30 minutes later, I've got my amazing cheese-less pizza with such powerful flavors, you would seriously think cheese was on this. So if I know that a pizza from here without cheese is possibly the best pizza I've ever had, well, think of the possibilities YOU have WITH cheese! For all you pizza lovers out there, cheese tolerant or not! Order from here! I'm telling you, you won't be disappointed.",

Delivery order (made online) around 11/20:  2 large pizzas (1 cheese, 1 bbq chicken with onion) 1 order of garlic knots.  Order was delivered within 30 minutes of ordering, delivery driver was courteous. Order was 100% correct and the pizzas were cooked perfectly.  Pick-Up Order (ordered online 12/7):  2 large pizzas (1 cheese, 1 pepperoni) 1 order of cheese bread  The store front is a little small, but the staff are so kind and it smells AMAZING in there!! They were extremely busy and still found time to give us a warm welcoming. Order was 100% correct and waiting for us when we arrived, pizza was perfect.  Conclusion: This pizza is amazing and the cheese bread and garlic knots to die for!!! The price can't be beaten, and with the right search tools you can find coupons online! Why waste money at those chain restaurants when you can have handmade deliciousness! I will never get my pizza anywhere else but here again!",

I've never complained and usually ask for lightly baked.. but if we don't they always burn the pizza and then the kids won't eat it and that's money and food to the trash you shouldn't have to ask for your pizza to be lightly baked to be able to eat it!!! It even smells burnt!! Very bad",

I have been charged $2 for extra meat prior but this time asking me to pay $5 extra was a tipping point...it's a matter of principle not 2 or 3 $ extra....very disappointing for such a great place!
