The batter was a perfect crispiness the only problem was that the sauce was super sweet and was more like a syrupy glaze of orange flavored sweetness. I love that they have the option of brown rice. The food came out quickly and everyone who worked there seemed very pleasant. I'd go here for a quick convenient inexpensive bite to eat but not necessarily when I'm looking for a great meal.",

I went there last night when the owner wasn't working and received the worst customer service I have received in a long time. They messed up my order multiple times and told me I was wrong when I clearly wasn't. They gave me an attitude when I was attempting to be polite and didn't listen to me. Worst of all this was a takeout order and I had to drive there twice and then deal with their rude employees. Even the cook gave me an attitude. I have never received less than perfect customer service when the owner was there, but I am sad to say that me and my co-workers will never return to Tott's again. Best of all, when I got home they did not give me any soy sauce, sweet & sour sauce or pot sticker's sauce which I had asked for extra of each one on both trips... And I had just given them 50 dollars of my business...",

The portions are very large for one person but some items are complete with starch, protein and vegetables. Entrees included Thai and Japanese types in addition to American-Chinese  and Korean dishes.  I had the chicken with veggies with chow mein; the rest of the group also ordered individually, not knowing that the items should be shared. So some food had to be taken home.  My food was not drenched in the usual oyster or other American-Chinese popular sauces but tasted, maybe a bit too much, of the cooking oil it was sauted in.",

I was able to order Singapore Curry, Dragon Noodles (most like Thai), Malaysian Curry, and Spicy Island Chicken all under the same roof and they were all uniquely flavored and tasty.  At many places when a dish has a little red chili next to it indicating spice, it isn't really spicy but these dishes definitely had a kick to them, yum.    The reason I give this place 4 stars is because the venue itself doesn't have much appeal although it is clean, and the food was a bit on the salty side.  However, the large portions, great variety, and overall tasty food make this place a great choice for your next group get together.",

I ordered the beef udon. I was warned it was salty. Man was it salty. Black bean sauce and oyster sauce... I would maybe say tone it down with some beef broth or utilize, dare I say, sugar to balance out the flavor. But the udon noodle texture was on point. Not too chewy, not overly starchy.   Hubby had the Orange chicken. He loves orange chicken and fried rice together but the rice felt was not complimenting the chicken.   The atmosphere. Clean and orderly no complaints.   What would I change? Tenderizing beef too long. It's weird when you don't have to chew your meat.",

They had a great variety of veggies and they were cooked perfectly. Not limp, crispy without being too raw. Brown rice was perfectly cooked as well. Trouble was the curry. There was a layer of sauce on the veggies, as opposed to it swimming in curry. Which would have been fine except that there was a gritty texture, no silky coconut milk, no hint of fish sauce, and NO FLAVOR. There was not even a hint of heat, nor any other discernible spice notes. When has a curry ever been bland? I'm the wrong person to ask. I guess. I also tried the chicken pot stickers. They wrappers had a weird texture, the filling was super bland, and the sauce they came with was just thin, sweet, and totally forgettable.   Decor was inviting, it seemed clean, and the staff seemed fine (ordered carry out, my order was waiting for me when I got there, both the guy on the phone and the gal on the register seemed competent & friendly-ish)... I may be back the next time my son bugs me for Pei Wei. :)",

    "text": "The Hong Kong Style Rice Noodles with beef dish ( gon chow ngau ho, fried wide rice noodles with beef) is the most authentic Hong Kong style dish I have found in the valley. Except Tott's improved on this dish by making it less greasy than it is traditionally made. It totally takes me back to NYC Chinatown and Flushing where I grew up eating this dish a few times a week. I wanted to call my mom while I was eating to tell her that I finally found an authentic and good Chinese dish in Phoenix but she was already in bed for the night.   My fiance had the Orange Chicken with fried rice and he enjoyed it. I tasted some and although Orange Chicken is a Chinese-American dish, I have to admit it was tasty nonetheless. I do a lot of Asian cooking since it is the cuisine of my culture and as far as I can tell that there are no questionable ingredients in the sauce, like weird thickeners, strange syrups, or MSG and whatnot. It tastes as homemade as you can get from a restaurant (not that any real Chinese person would make Orange Chicken at home).  The portions were huge. My fiance eats like a horse, usually he polishes off his plate and the rest of mine, but this time he finished his dish and was too full to help me eat the rest of mine. I actually ended up taking home leftovers, that's how much food there was per order!  The quality of the ingredients was good, the chicken looks and tastes like chicken and the texture is of chicken.  Definitely a problem at other Asian dining establishments, but not an issue at this one.  The owner was on premises and he takes the time to talk with customers. He is willing to customize the dish to your liking. Feeling like 1/2 chicken AND1/2  beef? No problem. Extra spicy? Sure! No onions? Ok. I liked that.  I could not tell the ethnic background of the owner, but he does speak Cantonese like myself. So, this would go to say that perhaps the dishes that are not chiefly Chinese may not be to your expectation because they are not actually made by a True Korean/Thai, etc. and they may not be employing True Thai recipes or cooking techniques. I will give some of the Thai dishes a try at my next visit, but I have a feeling that the real standouts at this restaurant will be the Chinese dishes.  Place was clean and service was great. They have some really authentic dishes here, and now I feel like I don't need to bother going to those upscale fast food Asian chains anymore. They overcharge for the portion size that you actually get and the food isn't as authentic as they claim.  This place is a little far from my house but I'll definitely come back, I can't wait to try out other items on the menu!",

We saw the Yelp Sticker and figured it was fate....  Tons of pan-Asian -fusion options.... suh-weet.  Spicy spicy me likey!   This place has a kick which I love... I got the veggie panang with brown rice (call me a hippie). Tons of veggies, spicy curry and all was cooked perfectly. Snap peas, eggplant, large chunks of bell peppers, asparagus all mixed with some tofu. I greatly appreciate the fact there is an equal ratio of veggies... usually Asian spots will give you five million chucks of onions and not leave much else.   The boyfriend got the crispy beef... it was a lil tough but the crispy and sweetness was a good combo with the spicy curry.     Bathrooms are clean, 10% discount for students with valid (current) ID and the food is a good deal for what you get.... If you ever want to expand to California come to SANTA CRUZ!!!!

    "text": "Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.  I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.  First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.  There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here.",

Tott's is  a very good neighborhood spot - not necessarily a Chinese food destination.  On the other hand, the menu doesn't stop there also offering: Curry, Thai, and Japanese.  Clean?  Extremely!  Best yet you can see your food prepared! Fresh food?  Yes, definitely! Friendly?  Very!  The owner himself takes your order and says \"thank you!\" Good prices?  Yep.  $7 to $10 buys dinner. Portions?  Dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow. Seating?  Maybe, maybe not.  It's small restaurant and they do a very good business.  A few outside tables though. Service?  Very fast!  Take out took less than 10 minutes. Food?  Good!  Yet I always kick myself at home with menu in hand wishing I had ordered something else... .......Guess I'll have to go back!",

Picked up the food and it was waiting for us when we got there.  The crab puffs were a little heavy and greasy for our taste. The egg drop soup was delicious - lots of egg! The chow mein also had a lot of vegetables, which I loved! The orange chicken was okay; a little soggy. My mom liked the beef and broccoli, but didn't really have anything to say about it (pretty average). Portion sizes were great and I had my leftovers for lunch today. I would order from here again, especially for the mein!",

I haven't eaten at this place since they moved from the Guadalupe/McClintock location to the Ray/McClintock location, but I'm sure it's still great.    Hopefully the landlord is good with them and Tott's thrives here.  We'll come by some time.  I just recommended them to some people at church and they ate there today!  Great food, nice ambiance, good customer service.  The Chinese food, however, does cater more to the American taste rather than the Chinese, but that's okay.",

I ordered it with pork.  Most places use grounded pork...but got sweet diced Chinese bbq pork.  You can tell the pork was old by the taste and hardness.  It was an interesting combo...sweet, spicy, and salty.  The potstickers didn't have any texture or flavor.  The best part was the skin and how little amount of filling used.  It reminded me of frozen ones bought from the store but not as good.  The menu said chicken potstickers...guess it could be or mashed anything.",

My favorite menu item, for only $6.25, is the sampler plate. Three spring rolls, four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce. Everything is perfectly cooked, with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers, cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like spring.  No MSG. Pure vegetable oil. Trimmed meats to reduce fat, and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks.  Easily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona.",

I remember when I finally went in there this past Saturday, that I had stopped by this place when I first moved to Arizona and really wanted a smoothie-but I think all their smoothies had dairy so I just left. A really nice warm environment-still totally a quick lunch place, but I still felt comfortable coming here at night-and judging from the full tables of ASU hipsters feeding each other tofu on dates, so did they.  I mean, the staff knows what is in all their dishes and I asked for the Tofu Yellow Curry with no fish sauce added in with rice which came within ten minutes and it was so good. Not very complex, but there were plenty of vegetables in it for once (not the usual onion and sad little pepper swimming in curry) perfectly sauteed and the rice was so good I kept eating it by itself instead of pouring the coconut in it.  I also really liked grabbing the fortune cookies before we sat down and we opened them up while waiting for the food, and like naughty children got to get another one when leaving. I had a huge take-out container and I kept thinking about that huge white container sitting in my breakroom fridge. If I was a cartoon character, it would be a series of panels doing a variety of activities while a big fluffy thought balloon of Tott's yellow curry.",

I called in my takeout order an hour ahead; the woman taking my order repeated it to me twice over the phone [always a good sign]...I show up at the appointed hour and BAM, there's my order[repeated back again, thank you], screaming hot. This was a first visit and as reported by other yelpers, the manager greeted me with a smile and affable chit chat about my 4 different chicken dishes! He made me feel like I was the only one there and he was happy to be of service. What, I ask you, could be bad about THAT??   We tried the Bangkok curry, orange chicken, bourbon chicken, sweet and sour chicken [mainstay for the kids] and the potsticker appy. Large portions all, I gotta say I loved the curry as I am a total curry suck-up; but all of the others were really good. Of the non curry, I'd say the Bourbon was my fave. Potstickers and sauce were deevine. Could have made a meal of just them and probably will on a return trip.   Immaculately clean space with tables in and out, its my new go-to place for Chinese. Top notch service, four entrees, each with an accompanying rice container, potstickers and the harbingers of my future, fortune cookes, I walk away smiling, having spent $36 before tip.",

Unfortunately, when I came, I wasn't able to see Yun on the day that I dined there, but I still enjoyed my visit.  They had an assortment of noodle dishes you can order from all over:  Japanese, Singapore, Korean, Hong Kong, Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Bangkok, and Malaysian styles to name a few.  Lots of reasonably priced appetizers and curry dishes.  We ordered during dinner with appetizers so it was over $10 a person, but their lunch specials are generally around $6-8/person.  We had Pork Roll (YUMMY!! I recommend this!!), Tom Yum Soup (tasty, but we won't order it again), Lemon Chicken (Yummy for the many tender cubed pieces of white meat chicken.), and the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodle (HUGE bowl of dry curry noodle.  It was good :) ).  One more thing, if you're looking to try this place out, it's next door to Starbucks.",

    "text": "If you go to Tott's enough times the GM will eventually know you by name. He's always there and lives on a cot located in the back room.  If you bring a date he'll know her by her name too and he'll have no qualms flirting with her.   Still, shouldn't every Mom n' Pop restaurant in your neighborhood be like that?   Tott's has more ambiance than your average Mom n' Pop place. I kind of see it as a small corporate place that just isn't named Pei Wei. After all, the restaurant is connected to Starbucks.   Remember, this isn't a Chinese restaurant. It tries to cover the Asian gamut by offering some choices of Thai and Japanese food. You won't find sushi here, but you can get a big bowl of udon and there are a variety of thai curry sauces to choose from.   I usually get take out from here but it's got an elegant little dining area and the outside patios with its metal tables really are quite nice when the weather allows. The dark wood tables and non-traditional flooring makes you feel like you're eating in a place fancier than you really are.   Tott's has raised its prices more than once over the last few years though. Pei Wei moving into the same parking lot didn't help matters.   Also, the workers who you see on the same regular basis are not nearly as friendly as the GM is. It's not that they're nasty, but you don't have to ask me my name on a take out order if I just paid with a credit card (with my name on it) or if I've been there (and seen you) multiple times that month.   People I've taken there like his personal, friendly approach and enjoy the food. Tott's serves some non-traditional dishes though and it's not for everyone.   Twins Pork has jalepenos and bacon. The Lo Mein has somewhat of a smoky flavor to it that I think blows YC's out of the water. Also, some of these dishes are spicier than people are used to at a Chinese restaurant. Other dishes are very thick and syrupy over meat (stir fried crispy beef).   There are a number of items I really enjoy on the menu. I notice that portions differ though. My black plastic box on take out never seems to be all the way stuffed and lunch specials are made to be bigger than they are by giving you half a plate of rice.   When prices go up and I feel I'm getting lesser portions I have an issue.   I've also never heard of paying extra for friend rice with a lunch special until I started eating here. The brown rice, which is free, is good though.   I don't eat here as often as I used to. It's tough to pay nearly $9 without a drink and not be completely filled up on a take out order.   I find that some of the thai dishes tend to be very saucy and are more of a value.   I give it 3.5 stars. A few years back I would have said 4.5, but it's just become less of a bang for your buck and in these recessionary times, that matters.",

It's not as crowded, therefore the noise level is conducive to gossiping or business talks. The Bourbon chicken is pretty good, and I personally like the Malaysian chicken, made with a dry curry sauce...oh boy, was it spicy...but the good kind.   Yun (the manager or the owner? not sure) is just too friendly and funny. If you don't see something in the menu, or you want to combine a number of things from the menu...just ask Yun if he can accomodate. And he most likely can hook you up with what you are craving for.",

They only serve to make you look like Fred Durst.  And trust me, no matter what dorky haircut you have under that cap, it is infinitely sexier than looking like that guy.  Luckily, my food arrived before I yanked the beanie off Marky-Mark's head.  Maybe all the thai food has just destroyed my taste buds so thoroughly that all inferior asian cuisines are rendered tasteless.  Or maybe Tott's just isn't all that good.  I had the orange chicken with brown rice.  A more accurate description might read, \"I had the carmelized sugar chicken.\"  It was so sweet that my stomach began to ache as I finished my 6th bite.  I had to leave my food unfinished.  Not because I was full but for fear of diabetes.  On the plus side, it's clean, fast, and the staff seem quite friendly.",

This meal did not disappoint! Covered in a lovely mild curry sauce were Chinese green beans, onions, mushrooms, eggplant, and sweet peppers. This curry really is mild, it was barely warm, but so delicious! The atmosphere is happy and busy. Judging by the conversations in line many were regulars. I should mention you will not leave hungry. Each time I have eaten here I have tried to leave some food for left over, but there is never any left over. I dont know why but this place reminds me of a NYC diner. Young knows his customers and greets them like friends. You will want to lick the bowl at this restaurant, but please don't your mom would not approve!",

Most of staff have worked at Tott's for years. Who wouldn't with a boss like Young! Although I have tried most of the dishes, a few of my favorites are the Pad Thai, sweet and sour chicken, (all white meat)!and Kung Pao chicken.  I like to change the Kung Pao a bit (add and delete veggies) and they never have a problem with this request. I almost forgot, the fried rice is one of the best that I have had.

It's Pei-Wei style restaurant, where you get your own silverware and such, and the owner and even staff would walk around and take your plate if you were done and even refill my drink. Very friendly.  I get the orange chicken like so many other people- and it's delicious. My favorite part was me and my friend COULD share a meal because it's so much food.

It's not your traditional \"everything is battered in MSG and fried\" kind of Chinese place.  Top items are Kung Pao anything, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.  Customer service here is also impeccable.  The owner is seemingly always on the premises and is concerned about the quality of your meal.  In fact, I see the same employees year after year, so I imagine he treats them as well as the customers.",

Not the kind where you get sexual satisfaction, although eating good Asian food can be orgasmic, which is why they won't let me eat at the restaurant anymore, but the taste and morning after effects are always the key.  Good, healthy portions make it half the cost because it becomes two meals. Great place for a date or just sitting alone, moaning in pleasure, which is why they won't let me eat inside anymore.  Many delicious dishes and the gigunda pork egg rolls are huge and give me pleasure like no woman can, which is why no woman will let me eat in the restaurant anymore.  Plenty of parking and a coffee place next door, which oddly enough also won't let me stay inside anymore. I just sit in my car, facing towards the restaurant and eat my take out meal, moaning in delight and starring at female diners, while my van is a rockin'. Yes, I see you putting that egg roll into your mouth, lady. Oooooooh YES!  TMI? I can never tell.",

I've been here twice, the first time being told by a couple of friends how good it was, but it was rather lacking. Same as Panda Express.  2nd time, much better. I asked for extra spicy and that's what I got, but the flavor wasn't compromised. Good job. Still, nothing great, but I would return since there really is nothing else around.",

Due to sparkling reviews of Tott's and the fact that it is located across the street from my home I decided to give them a try.   I phoned in an order for stir fry Mongolian beef with brown rice.  The order was ready upon my arrival so there was no wait time. The guys at the counter were friendly so no complaints about customer service.   However, I was somewhat disappointed in my Mongolian Beef as it was extremely sweet. It was full of tender slices of beef and lots of veggies but entirely too sweet for my taste buds.  I will definitely return and try other items suggested by fellow Yelper's but I will definitely stay away from the Mongolian unless I am craving dessert.",

They have a lot of options which would allow for any combination of asian food one can imagine or be in the mood for.  I ordered the Spicy Szechuan with Tofu which seemed to have  out too quickly is my estimation.  The vegetables were hardly warmed up  and suspended in a huge amount of viscous pink sauce that had no spice at all.  It was so dense and cooled so quickly the veggies were floating in it like jello.  I can;t say I would recommend this place or that I'll be back anytime soon.",

OK, so this pretty much means they buy the tofu already fried and don't cut it up and fry it themselves...   When I got home (3 miles away) the food was luke-warm.  The orange chicken appeared to have been prepared by dumping 1/4 cup of red pepper flakes into the sauce.  There's no veggies with the orange chicken, and it didn't taste any better than any other random Chinese place.  The steamed rice was dry and slightly hardened, another disappointment.    My girlfriend had the tofu curry which was ok she said, nothing special.    Inside the store it was all young people who seemed polite.    Really, it was nothing to warrant even 2 stars in my opinion.    Even the fortune cookie we received had broken English:  \"Like the river flow into the sea.  Something are meant to be.\"",

Mine was the szechuan chicken and my friend had the mushroom w/veggies. The dinner portion was large but half of it was rice.

To the employee that took the call thank you for being the adult over that child that you work for. Totts you get 1 star minus 4 stars you spineless snake.",

Come in and expect Chinese-American food, NOT traditional Chinese food.  They also have a smattering of curries and Japanese food.  I ordered a couple things for lunch.  Pork rolls, basically pork egg rolls.  These were just OK.  They are VERY big, so decent value.  But the filling is mostly cabbage with very little pork, in this case they use BBQ pork.  I appreciate that the vegetables still had crunch to them.  Also ordered salt and pepper chicken with a side of broccoli instead of rice or noodles.  The broccoli was well cooked and left crisp, nothing special.  The salt and pepper chicken maintained its crispy breading but lacked a little flavor otherwise.  They use dark meat, which I appreciate.  Kept it moist and had more flavor.  There are things to like.  They have a list of quality controls that they use which is nice.  None of the food felt greasy at all (a far cry from Panda Express), they say no MSG, and some other  health-related stuff.  All that is well and good, but none of the food excited me.  It was serviceable fast-casual Chinese-American food.",

The green curry consistency was thick and gelatinous, which I do not like. There was not much liquid in the dish like usual green curry. It was also very spicy and they did not ask my spice level preference so I assume it is pre-made. I also found a dark eyelash in my bowl while I was eating it. Not what I want to see in my dinner!  The pad Thai noodles were rubbery and it was just 'okay'. A little dry.   I got take out on my way home from work. Although the price was good ($17ish for the 2 dishes), I will not be returning here.

Not a good thing with Asian food. Pork rolls excellent. Really reminded me of the ones I had growing up in NYC. Chicken wings very good. Crispy beef was very good. Beef lo mein ok, I would have liked bean sprouts and more scallions in it. Lemon chicken really disappointed. Not lemony although tart. More breading than I would want. Because the broccoli was not packed separately it became overcooked and soaked up a lot of the sauce. While this is a risk with take out it can be avoided easily by packing the vegetables separately for dishes like this. All and all we did like it and will go back.",

We thought that PeiWei would do the trick, some kind of noodle something or other. Turning into the parking lot too early though had us passing this place, we yelped it and seeing its solid four stars after 40 reviews, we had to try.   Tott's does not disappoint.  The menu is actually pretty similar to Pei Wei with one outstanding factor, the owner of this place came out and talked to us, him and his family own and run it.  They've been there for six years now he says (2 before Pei Wei).  Pretty messed up that the property owner would put a second Asian diner in there.  Pretty messed up that Pei Wei would try to exploit a mom and pop shop's built up following.  Tott's still thrives he says, and thrive they should.  Service, ingredients and preparation are outstanding here.  The menu spans several nationalities, from Chinese to Thai to Japanese.  Pretty basic stuff but great if you have a craving for any of those, and easy to suit many palates in one place.  Lady had the Hong Kong noodles.  Wide noodles with cabbage and bok choy.  Wonderful flavor here, kind of a grill taste.  My choice was Udon noodles with beef as well.  Noodles were very soft and the fermented beans that made the sauce for mine were very flavorful.  Neither dish was particularly spicy, but both had great flavor.  Definitely better than any fast Chinese I have had in the valley.  Great atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food for very cheap.",

The sauce was not too heavy, but enough to coat the rice a bit.    The best part, however was that I called it in to go.  I asked for my curry to be very spicy and the GM (referenced in my earlier review) made me promise that I had enough water at home.  Cute and hilarious.

I can't really give much commentary on the menu because I always get the shrimp with walnut sauce but that is pretty tasty!  The prices are incredibly reasonable, comparable to most Chinese take out but minus all the grease and MSG.  Highly recommended!  EDITED TO ADD: I'm sad but I'm reducing my rating due to subsequent visits.  I don't know if it's me or the restaurant but I've been here at least 4 times and each time the food was less than stellar.  I tried the Pad Thai, the Vegetarian Fried Rice, a curry dish and the Sweet & Sour Shrimp and each time, I could barely finish it.  On the other hand, my fiance loved what he ordered so again it could be me.  I kept it at 3 stars because the service is still great and the place is clean.  I don't know what happened with the food though. :-/",

Here's the thing, the only vegetarian item on the menu is the Szechuan Tofu and Vegetables. A dish that is \"meh\" at best.   All the others have either chicken powder (WTF?), oyster sauce or both, thus making 'em not suitable for vegetarians.  Also: Was told the spicy tofu was veg the first time I tried Tott's. Found out it was not on the second.  The bummer is, these are ingredients that could easily be subbed or omitted.  Nowadays, the vast majority of Chinese restaurants are very accommodating to (the growing population of) vegetarians. It is easy to substitute meat with tofu and have the kitchen leave the animal ingredients out. Tott's fails to make the effort.  If you are in the area and are looking for great take-out Chinese that is super accommodating to vegetarians, than I recommend a certain \"Express\" not too far North of Tott's. You won't be disappointed.",

If you do, however, live or work in the area, I would highly recommend checking it for a fast and decent Asian lunch or dinner. And, yes, I use the word Asian, not Chinese - even though the dishes on the menu are primarily Chinese (although even that word is used loosely), the owners' inclusion of select Thai and Japanese dishes makes the cuisine more Asian than Chinese. Sort of like the food at Pei Wei, which just happens to be in the same center, but cheaper, more flavorful, and served with a little more heart.   I was in the area picking up some medicine at our vet, so I thought I'd stop in and try one of Tott's lunch specials. Parking was a little tight in that particular part of the center, but I lucked out and found a decent spot that someone was pulling out of. When I went inside, I was impressed by the clean and simple decor - the red/black loft-like ceiling and tile backsplash behind the register were especially nice touches.   I was also impressed by how amicable and helpful the GM was. When I placed my order (the $5.99 lunch special of Spicy Szechuan with tofu and brown rice) and asked how spicy it would be on a scale of 1 to 5 (since the signature chili symbol on a Chinese menu doesn't usually mean much), he took the time to explain that it was prepared medium-spicy and that if I really wanted to experience the full savoriness of the dish, I would probably enjoy having it spicy. He even added in a comment about how he approved of my choice since \"spicy is good for the body\"! Even though he was super-busy during the \"lunch rush,\" I definitely appreciated his willingness to assist me in making my food the way I like it.   I sat down and put my number card on the edge of the table, but I didn't have to wait long for my food. The GM came over with it just 3 or 4 minutes later. The portions of the tofu/veggies and rice were quite substantial, and I could see that the veggies were fresh by how crisp and colorful they were. I was also impressed by the flavor of the dish; while the sauce was definitely your run-of-the-mill Americanized brown gravy, the spiciness was definitely there and the tofu and veggies were cooked really well. When I was done eating, I felt satisfied but not too heavy.   Tott's is a clean, friendly, and flavorful alternative to other fast-food Chinese joints or to Chinese restaurants offering lunch specials. I will definitely be back if I'm in the area again.",

Please take some time out of your day to try some Chinese that's not poured out of a semi truck shipped from California(if not further).",

    "text": "Tott's gets five stars from me -- not as in 3 Michelin stars -- but as in \"this place is perfect for what it's supposed to be.\"    And what is it supposed to be?  Asian fast food, dine-in / take-out.  And why is it perfect at being that?  For starters:  - excellent recipes, delicious menu, lots of variety - top-notch ingredients (no fatty meats & bright, crisp veggies) - very generous portions (the dinner portions = 1.5 to 2 meals) - clean (including the restrooms) - friendly staff (managed by Yan (Yun?), the owner's brother-in-law) - the Bourbon Chicken, Twins Pork, and Dan Dan Noodles (yes, they deserver their very own bullet point)  The first time my fiancee and I ate at Tott's, it lasted for 3 days.  We went on a Sunday and ordered the Bourbon Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles with Beef.  They were so delicious, but the portions were so huge we got to eat the left-overs for lunch the next day.  Of course, when dinner rolled around, we were dying to try more of the Tott's menu...so we did.  The next day?  Repeat.  Pretty much nothing but Tott's right on thru Tuesday.  Yan, the manager, is a very friendly person, who obviously cares about the restaurant.  He takes the product and the service very seriously.  I'm sure he's a big reason why this restaurant is so spot-on.  I can't believe this place has been around for four years (as of this writing), and I've only just now discovered it.  If you haven't discovered it yet, do yourself a favor and order yourself some Bourbon Chicken asap.  Check out the web site (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftottsasiandiner.com%2Fsection.html&s=5834f5964d7ffceedc9164391c0dfd35ecaf6936b4ab032480ff92e0e02dda6d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tottsasiandiner.com/sect...</a>) to see the menu and pricing.  Did I mention the Bourbon Chicken?",

The owner is very friendly and greets and chats with most customers. If you become a repeat customer, expect to be greeted with a welcoming smile.    It's unfortunate that he lost the lease in Tempe just after the 1st of the year, but they are open again at their new location  4030 W Ray Rd E1, Chandler, AZ   Stop by and give them a try you won't be disappointed.  Update 1/16/13 Since moving the portions have shrunk, the prices have risen and the quality also has slipped.",

I really want to like this place because it's close to home, the service is friendly and fast, and it looks clean and well run. But the amount of sugar used is just bizarre. Today I got Twins Pork and there is more syrupy sweet sugar than pork (and they were generous with the pork). Before that, I got the Spicy Szechuan chicken, it wasn't quite this sweet but close. Funny thing is, I purposely ordered the pork dish because I figured there was no way they could make it that sweet. My bf got the Hong Kong rice noodles -- those were not sweet and they were really good.  Maybe you just have to experiment and find the right dishes here, but it still seems like an strange variation to be so heavy handed with the sugar. The other ingredients seem better quality than lots of Asian fast-food places.",

We've been coming there for years so on occasion, he'll bring us an extra dish to sample like the amazing Walnut Shrimp.  Some of my favorites are the Kung Pao and Orange Chicken.

The owner is a small Asian man who smiles a lot and always wants to know if he can get us anything else.  I see him every time I go.  Everyone I go with loves their orange chicken.  It is very tasty, but a little on the sweet side for me.  I like a spicy dish, so I go with the Malaysian Curry.  Chicken, red curry, fresh veggies, fried rice.  Amazing.",

My food was prepared quickly, the restaurant was clean, with a nice vibe, and the staff was very polite. The cool, rockstar-looking guy at the counter even brought my food out to the car for me.

Take out is great too though- hot food in separate dishes with lots of rice. We live about 20 minutes away and will drive there for their great Asian food over other places near us! Get over to Totts if you haven't tried it yet!",

I think it was made by someone who never tasted noodles, never mind Singapore Noodles. It was tasteless. Just boiled rice Vermicelli. Ordered a Thai Red Curry. Didn't even smell good. So you can imagine the taste. No lemongrass or nothing Thai about it. It tasted like a regular Curry with Curry powder.  Dragon Noodle, tasted like wax. Called the restaurant & told them about it immediately. They didn't seem to bother about it. Just said they will let the Chef know.  We had to get Burgers & that was our dinner. Before you start cooking food from another region you should first learn the taste. Taste it from other restaurants & then match it. Definitely won't be going here ever again.",

    "text": "Tott's is this amazing little neighborhood Asian restaurant that has quickly become a favorite of mine! The simple yet effective decor is vibrant without being tacky.  The service is very friendly and helpful.  They are always smiling and it actually seems sincere! This is one of those places where you order your food from a cashier and they give you a number and you choose your seat from one of the 16 or so tables.  There is a nice little patio as well.  There are a couple of tasks you must do before they bring out your order.  1. Fill your cup with your beverege of choice (Soft drinks and Tea only- no alcohol, hence only 4 stars).  Do get a beverege as the food can be very hot if you like that way-AND I DO!  And because I am a fool thinking it will never be hot enough, I grab a jar of the hot mustard and one of the Hot Chili paste to bring to my table.  You can, of course, choose chopsticks or a fork.  I usually start with the good intentions and select the chopsticks.  I pretend I know exactly what I am doing.  But these never work as I cannot get enough food into my mouth quick enough so I end up with at least 1 fork. I am impressed how quickly they bring your order to your table.  I barely have time to do all of the above and get back to my table and they are bringing out a gorgeous plate of steaming Hot Korean with black bean sauce and tofu, or the yellow curry \"panang\" also with tofu.  You can aslo get chicken, beef or fish.  The meats are hand trimmed and do not have that grisle part that is such a turn off at other places.  The vegetable are as bright and fresh as the smiles on the employees' faces. I must also confess my longing for PF Chang's or Pei wei has certainly  diminished after discovering Tott's. Tott's even has excellent Won Ton soup. Now if they could only get a beer and wine license.",

I order the Honey Walnut shrimp and it was perfect, not too much mayonnaise and crispy to the bite! So far the service I got was quick and friendly! Not too big of a restaurant! Perfect for the neighborhood! The place feels like a whole in the wall restaurant with good food. lol BUT its a modern and clean looking place!! The price is average for a meal around 10 bucks. A little high for quick Chinese take out, but worth it! I would say the restaurant without the host and waiters!! lol! I will be going back to try the other dishes and keep my review updated!",

He said the reviews were very good and he'd like to try. I had no interest for a long time, but the other day we went for dinner.  The food is a bit different than regular asian restaurants.  It is in the same center as Pei Wei and the food comparable. The atmosphere doesn't compare to Pei Wei, but that's not a factor most of the time. I ordered a crispy noodle dish with veggies & chicken.  It was yummy.  The thing that struck me was that they used fresh, fresh veggies - like right out of the produce truck fresh.  Everything was bright and crunchy and the mushrooms were fresh, big slices of yummy mushrooms. It wasn't super packed but there were a ton of pick up orders.  The place is clean, the cooks were clean, the food is clean. I will go here again.",

I wanted to try Tott's at least five times before I left a Yelp! review. Tott's has become my new go to Asian Restaurant and confidently I can call it the BEST IN CHANDLER!  Tott's is most importantly very consistent and has outstanding customer service! Everytime I have ordered pick up from Tott's the food is FRESH, HOT, and very FLAVORFUL. The portions are respectable and prices fair. My favorite entrees are the Chicken Pad Thai, Hong Kong Beef, Orange Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, Vegetable Lo Mein, and Pot Stickers.",

    "text": "There are a few times I wish I could give more than 5 stars, and this is one of them.  I can't believe I waited so long to give Tott's a try.  Just a little background on my experience with Chinese food.  My mother was not a great cook and the only time we had anything even remotely resembling Chinese food was when she would crack open a can of that LaChoy Chow Mein.  It.  Was.  Awful.  I had to wait until I was in college to get some good Chinese food and a friend took me to Yen Ching's in Waterloo, IA and set me up with sweet and sour chicken and mongolian beef.  Ever since then I've had a serious love affair with mongolian beef, and I'll get sweet and sour chicken if a restaurant does it up with the peppers, onions, and pineapple.  I've discovered over the years that very few places do that any more.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers and their pictures, I can see that Tott's does it correctly.  Right away I was greeted by the employees, and the dude who took my order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered my lunch to dine in, and then an order of pork lo mein to go, to take home for my husband.    The restaurant isn't very big, but it's organized well and very clean.  My order of cheese puffs was so nice and light and the sweet & sour chicken was perfect.  I loved that the owner came around and introduced himself and when I told him I like how they prepared my lunch he said, \"Isn't that the way everyone does it?\"  Nope.  Absolutely not.    The chicken was lightly breaded and fried and the flavors with the sweet & sour sauce and peppers, onions, and pineapple were delicious.  It tasted like they use a good quality sweet & sour sauce too.  Usually the sauces at most places are very syrupy and sugary, almost like someone did a Red Bull reduction, and I usually get heartburn after eating them.  Not in this case.  The sauce was nicely balanced and so far no heartburn.  With the cheese puffs, a fountain soda, the sweet & sour chicken, and the lo mein my total was $20.27 before tax & tip.  Excellent experience all around.  This is food and customer service as good as it gets for sure!  Can't wait to go back!",

Long story short: I wanted crab puffs, didn't get crap puffs in delivery, called restaurant, they told me to call grubhub, called grubhub, and the grubhub guy couldn't find my order and failed; so no refund... maybe the staff was off its game, or what not, but all I wanted was crab puffs. So if you try to deliver from this place with your priority being crab puffs - be wary. Aaaaand to top it off, there was a hair in my food. Teaches me one lesson though, don't tip before you get your food.",

I like that it had a little candied sort of chew to it instead of being mushy like chicken that has been sitting around. The Singapore noodles were nicely spiced but foe the vegetable option were lacking a bit. It is, however, going to fill you up. The spring rolls were good though I didn't have any soy sauce in the bag (I'm not a fan of the sweet chili stuff). The only thing I don't recommend is the chicken wonton soup, very bland. I'd def get the sesame chicken and the noodles again.",

    "text": "My goal here is a PSA to VEGETARIANS...    The menu at Totts seems to have a significant vegetarian menu, but eater beware that here, fish sauce, shrimp paste, eggs, and CHICKEN powder, is considered vegetarian.  You are best off asking for a \"vegan\" option.  ( I think there is only one).    I think I eventually got  the Spicy Szechuan with tofu/veggies. The portion was huge, the veggies were fresh.  It tasted ok. The restaurant is clean. The server / host staff was very nice.  The owner, I am truly disappointed in.   I got there, ordered what I presumed was vegetarian (asked if sauce had shrimp/fish paste -they said no).  Afterwards, I asked if the curries had fish/shrimp paste, and she said yes, and asked if I had an issue with animal byproducts, because the dish I had ordered, has CHICKEN powder in it.  Apparently they consider Chicken powder to be vegetarian.  Fine, whatever, we have different definitions. I appreciated that the woman went back to grab my ticket / ask if I could get the dish without it / what I could get instead.   Next the owner came over to me, and got really upset!  All I asked him, was to clarify what on their menu, did not have any animal byproducts.  His response was that your people come in here all the time and have different definitions of vegetarian.  This is my restaurant, and yes, here this is what I call vegetarian.  Fine, I'll agree to disagree on the definition of vegetarian, but by no means, as the owner should he have YELLED at me for inquiring what he considered to be vegetarian / what they had that did not have animal products in it.    If we had not already paid, I would have left.    So while, the place is clean, staff was nice, food was ok, the owner/GM was outright rude, and had extremely POOR customer service.  For that I go out of my way to write a review, give you a 1, and tell ALL OF MY VEGETARIAN friends to avoid your restaurant.    Thanks for the unpleasant experience.",

Much tastier than Panda Express and Pei Wei in my opnion. Comes with your choice of steamed or fried rice. Also, if you request it, they will make it spicier for you as everything is made to order.   Another good choice would be the Sweet and Sour Chicken, not as crunchy as the Orange Chicken but just as much flavor. It also comes with plenty of veggies and pineapple chunks, something that is really hard to come by at a place like Panda Exp.   I think what really makes this restaurant better than some of your other fast food Chinese type locations is their friendliness and service. Every order I have made whether it be take out or dine in has been correct and really quick. Even with young workers behind the register, they are on top of everything and pay attention to your order. The owner is usually on hand cooking or serving which gives it a local feel rather than a chain.   Check it out if your in the area",

We tried the crab puffs which we all agreed were the best we'd had, the wonton and egg drop soup came out so hot and had more than a few peas in it like most other places, the walnut shrimp was beautiful and creamy, the Mongolian beef was a favorite and the mushroom stir fry was chock full of veggies. We also did the teriyaki chicken, sauce was a little sweet but ok because it came on the side anyways. I had the lemon chicken which was a bit flavorless for me and came with broccoli, chow mein noodles, brown, white or fried rice ( your choice). The portions were huge and we took a ton home. Also, the lettuce wraps were amazing and the prices were fair for the amount of food you get.This is now our new spot and if you try it, it'll be yours too.",

I used to go to Tott's all of the time when I worked around the corner from their old location on Guadalupe/McClintock. When our company moved, I stopped going so I am glad I found them again!   Awesome Food and Great Service! Young has always been really nice and so has the other staff.  The Highlights for me: - Great Service! The staff has always been really polite and friendly - The food is always Excellent and the price is really good for the portion you get.  - Egg Drop Soup (only $2) - Always Piping hot and doesn't have nearly as much Sodium as other Asian places. - Kung Pao Chicken - Great flavors, not too saucy and the Chili Peppers have a smoky flavor that I can probably pop them on its own all-day long.  - The Curries - Bangkok & Singapore are really good! I usually get the Chicken or Beef and a side of brown rice. Much better then the local Thai restaurants who serve Curries.   Overall, Glad I found them again and Keep banging out Quality food and great service!",

I am in sales and have a keen sense of customer service and was thrilled to learn that Tott's Asian Diner not only delivers fresh, great tasting food, but exceptional service too.

    "text": "This was the second time that we have eaten at this restaurant. I've been looking forward to returning since our first visit because we all thought that the food and service was great.   Unfortunately our experience tonight was less than satisfactory.   When we arrived there was only one other table eating so I don't think that our experience had anything to do with it being a busy night.   We ordered chicken lettuce wraps, sesame chicken, orange chicken and chow mien. The sauce for the sesame chicken was overly gelatinous and the chicken was over breaded and soggy.   I didn't taste any orange in the orange chicken in fact, if I had closed my eyes, I would not be able to tell which was orange chicken and which was sesame chicken.  All of the dishes were sweet and none of them had stand out flavors. I guess they use the same sauce in every dish?  The chicken lettuce wraps would have been the best item of the night IF totts provided enough lettuce cups in the order. Standard order serves 4 lettuce cups. We asked for more cups and were told that they charged 2.50 for 4 more lettuce cups. We're talking iceberg lettuce, come on. I always ask for extra lettuce cups whenever I order lettuce wraps and I've never been charged.    My daughter found a bone in her chicken. When we were finished eating, my husband went up to the counter and told the woman who was up front about the bone. Her only response was \"Oh, okay.\"  He came back to the table and rethought what happened and Went back up to the counter to ask to speak with the manager. The cashier said the girl he just spoke to was the assistant manager.  The assistant manager asked if she could help him. My husband stated that he was surprised at the way she handled the bone issue. She told him that they receive all of their chicken prepped so it wasn't the fault of the restaurant. My husband said that all he really wanted was an apology and recognition that there shouldn't be bone fragments in their food. She did apologize at that point and did comp the one dish Which was nice of her.   We all agreed that the food and service did not meet our expectations.  Not sure if our first experience was lucky or if this was just a bad night. Unfortunately we probably won't be back anytime soon.",

It was pure dark fatty batter coated  sesame and orange chicken!  We were so hungry, that we decided to just deal with it (it was horrible!!)  and never come back to this place ever again.

I ate there on their second day of being opened and I have loved the place ever since. They had to move locations due in part to a Pei Wei opening up literally 100 yards away in the same shopping center. Besides location, nothing has changed with this wonderful place.   The food is really great. I would say Tott's food is like Pei Wei's except it tastes better, they have larger serving sizes, and there is a lot more choices on the menu ;) The service at this place is excellent. If you appreciate a business where they make an effort to get to know you and remember your name you will love Tott's.   Pros: - Awesome service - short wait times - great food - great selection - large servings - very competitive prices  Cons - not much seating",

I ordered the orange shrimp and received orange chicken by accident, but honestly I didn't even care because it was that good. Tender chicken and a well balanced sauce that wasn't overpowering with just enough spice.   We also ordered the sampler plate, which was equally good, and fried rice. The fried rice doesn't taste NY style (says this native NYer) but still good nonetheless.   The overall theme is simple, quality, well balanced flavors that don't overpower each other. You can taste each of the ingredients used in the dishes and there's a real harmony, which is a rarity. If your palate is used to cheap ingredients drowned in sauce to mask their quality and poor cooking technique, this isn't for you. Additionally, a single order is easily double the quantity that other restaurants offer. Definitely a winner for us.",

While I did get a student discount, my meal came out to be around $14 for cheese puffs, walnut shrimp, and brown rice.  I suppose it's a pretty standard price but here's what it breaks down to:  - Standard cheese puffs with very little cream cheese.  The scallions were a nice touch though. - An incredibly small portion of waaay overly-battered shrimp with plain mayonnaise based sauce.  All in all, I wouldn't come back again!",

But, after going here a few more times, it kind of loses its luster a bit with each subsequent visit.   One thing unique about this place can say is it's unintentional comedic irony. What am I talking about, you say? Most family owned Asian places have the tacky fake crystal lights and generic table and chairs but this place has attempted to go in a different but equally unoriginal direction by copying every detail of the interior of a Pei Wei Asian Diner! It's actually pretty hilarious once you think about it because there is literally a Pei Wei accross the parking lot from this place.  On to the plate, Ive ordered few different things but tend to order the \"famous\" orange chicken more often than anything. It is pretty good but the chicken is so breaded and the sauce so thick and flavor-neutral (if thats even a term, if not then Im making it one), that it I find myself bored with the dish after a few bites. I've gotten it with brown and fried rice, I'd say go with the brown because the fried rice is bland. One time, I attempted to liven up the orange chicken dish and asked them to add long beans to it, that was a mistake. The long beans are rubbery and cold and flavorless.   I'll continue to go here but not as frequently. I wish I could say I'd found a place to permanently keep me out of Pei Wei but looks like this place will only sway me every once in a while.",

The food was okay and I eat a lot of chinese food but I definitely prefer panda garden over in ahwatukee to this place. I did only try one thing so I will be back for sure but the salt and pepper shrimp didn't do it for me.. Shrimp was overly chewy like a well done steak and the dry rub spices weren't really there it was almost just like o was eating a plate of fried shrimp. Staff was very friendly however and this is just based off one time so I will be back and try something else",

The Hong Kong with beef is my fave dish, and their portions always leave me with lunch for the next day:):) definitely worth a try!",

The food is always hot and delicious, the chicken sliced perfectly and just the amount of \"heat\" in a 3 star heat level for me! (nice touch permitting you to choose your \"heat\" level!)     Not only is the food great, the staff is amazing! The young man at the front has the best personality of anyone I have spoken to in that position of a restaurant in a long time! I ran in today to get my food at \"halftime\" of the NFC playoff game and he took the time to discuss teams/playoffs with me while he got together my to go order!    The only complaint I have is their website doesn't permit alterations, such as taking away or adding ingredients to your selections.  I order online so I can pay ahead and take away quickly and each time I have to call them after I order to \"minus the broccoli!\"  Won't take a star away for it, but would make the owner a \"star\" in my book if he considered adding that enhancement!!     Not much time today to add smaller details like I usually do... due to Goff is my fantasy quarterback and just threw a 25 yard pass to my fantasy receiver of Cooks!! ..... chat later yelpers and GO RAMS!

My first time here, I ordered take out and low and behold, I was actually shocked at the portion size of my dish. I had fried rice filled to the brim of a Chinese to-go box and the Kung Pao shrimp was in an entirely separate container. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or the veggies. It tasted extremely fresh and was super flavorful.   My second time around, I got the lunch size portion (which still lasted me two meals) of Mongolian shrimp. It was out of this world. Absolutely incredible. I definitely recommend this.   What takes the cake for me, however, are the cheese puffs. They are absolutely INCREDIBLE and I would go back just for these alone.   Love that they're local too! Definitely becoming one of my regular spots.",

However, it should be eaten quickly because the sauce quickly congeals if not eaten quick enough. Then, the pad sew ew was a bit light on the flavor, so I added some of the chili sauce from the container near the condiments section. The pad sew ew noodles were al dente, which I like, but some may not like their noodles that tough. The pad sew ew had carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, celery, green onions, and white onions in it.",

I'm very picky when it comes to pork fried rice (it depends on how the pork is cooked) and thanks to so many helpful Yelpers posting pics of their food, I was able to see that it was exactly what I was looking for.   My boyfriend had the orange chicken which came with a side of fried rice, while I obviously went with the pork fried rice. The portions were great and we had food left over for the next day, however my rice was just a tad bland. I added a little saracha and soy sauce to give it some flavor and it helped quite a bit; next time I will make sure to ask for the rice to be cooked extra spicy. We will definitely be back (especially since this is about 5 minutes from our place) due to the generous portion sizes, perfectly cooked pork and very friendly staff.",

    "text": "Our first time here and we won't be back... Mostly because it was DISGUSTING.  I honestly can't understand why there are good reviews.  The customer service was bad. We ordered and paid online for takeout. When we arrived, the older Asian man there, (instead of greeting us or welcoming us to our first time in or something) scolded us for ordering via GrubHub. He said we need to call and not order online. He said GrubHub is only for delivery.  I imagine he's upset bc he pays a percentage to GrubHub. Unfortunately, in 2018, people like ordering online. If you don't want to allow online ordering for other than delivery, perhaps you can talk to GrubHub or another company about getting that for you. Uber Eats maybe? I dunno...but don't scold customers for spending money at your business. Maybe you could give a discount to people who call to order takeout or something. That might motivate them to do that.   Biggest issue was that the food was gross. I bought $50 worth of food. About 90% went in the trash. We all agreed that it wasn't worth keeping. What a waste of money!  It was all dry... As if it was old or had been  frozen for too long or something. The flavor was bad. The texture was worse. The cream cheese in the rangoons was sweet...like cheesecake sweet.    The pork in the fried rice was chewy. The wings tasted like floor cleaning solution and a ridiculous amount of salt. The spring rolls were filled with a mush of vegetables.   I'm very unhappy that I spent my hard earned money at this place. I will absolutely never be back.  I guess the good news here is that I won't be inconveniencing that guy with my online takeout order.",

Continued into Dragon Noodles, which were quite spicy, but the flavors were not melded well, and the wide rice noodles absorbed the moisture quickly.  The orange chicken was good.  The Kung Pao Beef was very good.  The Walnut Shrimp was probably a little too sweet for my taste.  Steamed rice was fresh, fluffy, sticky but not too sticky.  Overall a fair restaurant, and if you're in the mood for fast casual Chinese in that area, I would definitely choose there rather than the other fast Chinese restaurants that are right around there, and choose Tott's over Pei Wei.",

Nasty and missing something. Fried rice was bland and old.   Second trip had the chicken lomein, again missing flavor and tasted old. Noticed 2 employees eating lunch and they had Pizza from another restaurant?  There are way better choices around that area, no need to go back.",

The people who reviewed this saying it tastes like panda must be having the best panda in the country, cause this is miles above any panda I've tasted. All in all great place - awesome food, friendly service, and very generous portions. I'll totally be going back!

Ray Road, Suite 1 , Chandler, AZ 85226.  It is on the northwest corner of Ray Road and McClintock...and alas, again...a Starbucks is down two doors from it.  Should I even mention the Gamestop neighbor?  All I can say is that the grand re-opening was standing room only and the food is just as delicious as we left it!  This location is a bit smaller I feel from a seating aspect, and I anticipate it will feel that way for a bit while the family gets into place and the locals discover this place so be prepared to wait a little.  But isn't no M.S.G, high quality veggies and meats, pure veggie oil only, well trimmed meats and poultry to keep the fat content low, and the general care and expertise in preparation worth the wait?    I can only now celebrate the year of the rabbit! I'm a Tott's fan for life!",

You will see that there isn't a difference in the taste.  I expected more from this place but the food is just your basic frozen food cooked in a wok...or microwave. I will say that my wife the lemon chicken and it tasted like it was cooked, left out, and then reheated, you know it had that \"reheated\" taste.  Unless the reheated taste is just the taste of the food and in that case it's just bad.  The service I guess was nice. 4 people on staff at the time, all were standing around talking. One guy was standing in front of the register playing jewel craft and he didn't acknowledge I was there. A girl took my order after shooing the guy away so she could enter my order in the register.  We also got pot stickers and they tasted like chemicals found in cleaning solution. My only guess for this was that they were sprayed on accident when someone was cleaning but it ruined them. They were also still raw and very under cooked. One was still cold in the middle.  If you want really good Chinese food, I suggest going to China Palace instead. They are always nice and helpful. I like their orange, sesame, and lemon chicken and it has a nice crispy taste to it, not soggy like Tott's.  Overall, if you like soggy breaded chicken then this place is for you.",

When we looked at the menu, my bf and I were confused what to order because we were hungry so everything looked delicious, lol. I finally made my mind to order their Orange Chicken and my bf was still thinking, then I looked at the man, he immediately told me 'oh that's ok! Take your time, no rush!!!' that was so nice of him! My bf ended up order their Kung Pao Beef. (we both ordered with Fried Rice)  The orange chicken was DELICIOUS, I like it a lot! I tried the Kung Pao Beef too and it wasn't bad. Orange chicken is more to the sweet side, Kung Pao is more to salty side with a little bit of spicy taste to it. But I was kinda disappointed with the fried rice, I wish they put more eggs and vegetables in there. As you can see from the picture, they cooked the rice with soysauce, that's it. I'm not saying it was bad, it really wasn't bad. But I just wish they put at least more eggs.  Overall, I love the service here! The food. The price wasn't bad either. I will be coming back next time to try out their other menu, but only if I am in the area though, hehe.",

    "text": "This update is based on experiences from months ago. I'm not sure what is happening, but the quality of food seems to have changed; gone down. I ordered Pad Thai chicken, which I have had before. The chicken was typically slices of breast or chicken tender meat. The chicken this time was thigh meat because it had gristle fat tying chunks of chicken together, and was in tiny chunks. Dark meat tastes different than white. The green onions seemed old, dried and wilted. I had to take the green onions out. Chicken wasn't bad, but thigh meat is cheaper and less lean than white meat chicken. So I'm paying the same price for less expensive, lower quality meat. The next time I ordered beef and broccoli. After a couple bites I noticed the broccoli on my fork had a black spot on it. I looked at other broccoli and found another with a larger black, moldy spot on it. I took it to the gal at the counter. She thought it was burned, but I told her it was mold spoilage. You could still see some of the mold fuzz. She apologized and asked what I wanted to do. I had her refunded me, and went elsewhere for lunch.  I haven't been back. The two stars is because the staff and service are still consistently good.",

Lowered my opinion of the restaurant a fair amount such that I considered not coming back (and I tell others not to add veggies bc of this).  +(lunch) kung pao chicken was tasty with a variety of veggies  ++(dinner with date) dan dan noodles, similar to before but without added vegetable issue:  good flavor, but also pretty strong and spicy, but also gets a bit bland over time (could maybe use veggies or some other things with it to diversify the flavor).  The girl that came with on the date ordered some green tea with her food, and Tott's graciously refilled it for free a couple of times for her. This generosity helped changed my review of this place to generally positive.  My date and I ended up sharing some really good conversation and times, such that I am hopeful we can come back together again someday.",

Service: Outstanding  The owner saw that a group of people had arrived, and he made sure that we could sit together, even though all six of us were ordering separately. He was very friendly to us and answered any questions we had.  Atmosphere: Everything is pretty basic in terms of furnishings and design, but it has everything a restaurant of this type needs. There are umbrellas and space heaters outside.  Tott's delivers on taste, comfort, and value. Check it out!",

My tongue was literally on fire and I askee them if they could do something to make it less spicy. They made an entire new dish fresh. I have been a fan of this place ever since.

It was also nice when I got sick and still wanted food food, but the Wonton soup hit the spot and was light enough for my tummy to keep down. I do need to ask on certain dishes to have light amounts of sauce cause it can be overwhelming sometimes, but they are more than happy to put less sauce in if need be.

Right around Panda Express prices but so much better-- everything feels and tastes fresher and better. The veggies are crisp. The meat is flavorful and good. Sauces are thick and delicious. I can't stress enough that you should try this place. Don't go to Pei Wei. Support this guy and his wonderful Asian food.",

You order at the counter, and they bring your your meals.  You fill your own drinks.  All the \"Stir Fry Your Way\"s are delicious.  I haven't made it to their curries yet, but I'm expecting greatness here too.  But one real standout is their Orange Shrimp.   It might not be the healthiest thing on the menu, and of course it tends to the sweet side, but it's hand-battered, and let me tell you, the breading is out of this world.  I don't know what they do to make it so rich and light at the same time, but the magic works.  This is not a large place and I sometimes wonder if I'm going to have a place to sit, but it's never failed me or my family yet.  The proprietor seems to always be there and I think his son runs the counter much of the time.  They're both wonderful hosts and they seem to have set a tone of friendliness and helpfulness with the rest of the staff.   It's a really nice, but no-frills atmosphere with really excellent food.

There is also a pei wei in the same area and I wish we just went to them because it is a bit better quality then this place.  I even had it a couple hours later after the meal cold, and I dont even know why I just felt like giving it another shot, but nope it was still making my insides hurt.

Place can get crowded during lunch - sometimes people have to wait for tables before they can sit down. Parking is always plentiful though since it's in a big mall.

I got the honey walnut shrimp and it tasted as if it had been fried/cooked in old oil. It had a terrible after taste. I stopped eating it, it was that bad. I contacted the restaurant and Summer began defending the oil, stating that the oil is changed every day and my complaint had her scratching her head as to how this could happen. I was shocked at her defensiveness and thought to call and soak with a higher Manager in the morning as I felt I would get no where with her.   If customer service is their focus, she didn't meet that expectation for me.",

    "text": "Good neo-Asian food and service  Stopped in when we were nearby, hungry, and saw Tott's has a great rating on Yelp!.  Nice restaurant with a good pace of customers and very pleasant staff.  Dessert options were a step above the norm at a small diner like this, which is useful when you have little ones like my wife and I.  Food is good, but not great to my tastes.  The Hot Korean is semi-spicy and would do better with bamboo versus the carrots and more chili pepper.  My wife had the Pepper Chicken (name?) and thought it was tasty enough, but some pieces were warm while others were cool.  Dumplings are not meaty and are more veggie... and the sauce is a sweet vinegar thing that doesn't give much appreciable flavor.  Our daughters thought the Terriyaki Chicken was too dry to finish.  Pumpkin Roll was yummy.  Almond Cookie Cheesecake was left half-eaten as my wife said it tasted more like orange mixed with cheesecake.  I took a bite and have to agree.",

Singapore noodles-so salty! Flavor was decent but I couldn't get past the taste of salt. pork rolls-in my opinion, way too large with filling that is too chewy and hardly any pork. Mostly cabbage.  Pork that was present was chewy and dry. crab wontons-decent but was sweet tasting, which I don't prefer. That's what the sweet and sour sauce is for. Curry vegetables-loved the mixture of eggplant, peppers, onions, carrots etc. Was not overcooked which is where many other places make the mistake with vegetarian dishes. Curry sauce however, was massively disappointing. Not enough curry and too much corn starch to \"thicken\" the sauce. No no no. ordering process was easy and food was ready when promised. 2 stars for this and for not over - cooking the vegetables as well as the generous portions.  Most likely won't be back. I don't know why it's so difficult to find acceptable Chinese food in this area. Boo :(",

In my experience, places that seek to incorporate dishes from all of Asia on their menu tend to be doing too much at an average ability. I opted for the Traditional Singapore Rice Noodles with Chicken.   Portion Size? Plentiful.  Price? Inexpensive, slightly more than chains (e.g. Panda Express).  Taste? The chicken was overwhelmingly dry and the vegetables were bland. The seasonings and noodles were average.  Of course, there may be dishes on the menu that they do a better job with but that would involve making a lucky pick. With so many Asian options in Chandler that specialize in a particular cuisine (strictly Thai or strictly Chinese) it makes it hard to justify a return visit.",

Let me break it down by stars...  1st Star = It is NOT fast food crap. It is fresh, made in house, and tasty Asian fusion (influences that are Cantonese, Szechuan, Japanese, etc.)  2nd = They seem religious about cleaning up and having a very presentable atmosphere. While small, it is comfortable and inviting vs. the shit boxes your run of the mill take out comes from.  3rd = Friendly. My god were they all so friendly. The GM came by and talked with us for 10 minutes, the guy behind the counter was super nice and accommodating. They sincerely seem to care about their customers.   4th = Portions are very generous. 2 entrees and and app and we took home leftovers  5 = Value vs quality. You will be hard pressed to find food this good and delicious for this kind of money.   The pork rolls were amazing.  The orange chicken is literally award winning. I tried the walnut shrimp, just wasn't for me, but I can't ding them for my taste...it was expertly put together and the shrimp were friggin' huge!   I'm sending the wife over there for lunch as we speak to grab the Salt and Pepper Crispy Shrimp...and some other goodies.   Thanks Totts! Keep up the stellar work!",

The food is consistently delicious - way better than you'd expect from a \"fast food\" Chinese establishment.  I've spent WAY too much time on the hunt for decent Chinese food during my time in AZ (about three years now), and have yet to find anything rivaling Tott's except for one place aaaaaaall the way up in Cave Creek.  That said, Tott's is about half the price of its closest competition and MUCH more conveniently located. They work fast, their service us always spot-on, and the food is always really really good (especially the Orange Chicken!).  I've never once eaten in, to be honest. I treat Tott's as my go-to take-out Chinese, even though I'm driving 20+ minutes to get there. (The fact that I'm driving so far for take-out Chinese should be pretty telling!)  If, like me, you're generally sad about the state of Chinese food in the state of AZ, give Tott's Asian Diner a try. I'm pretty certain you won't be disappointed. I never have been.  Thanks, Tott's, for being so awesome! See you again real soon!  :)",

Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.  Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.  Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself.",

Many of them items are available with tofu and veggies for `6.25-7.  Stir fry, noodles curry classics and more can be had.  I tried the Singapore noodles, thin noodles with yellow curry and tofu and veggies. The flavor of the curry powder was bright and clean. The garlic sambal this place has was a great compliment.   I also tried the red curry, it was very rich and tick compared to other curries and full of deep flavors.   Service was fast and there was some nice patio seating in addition to the inside. Great for lunch or a fast casual dinner.",

I am beyond scared to try small, shopping center, Chinese because I'm very sensitive to MSG and dairy. To my surprise this place was not only delicious but I did not get sick. We have ordered Totts about 10 times and every time it's always hot and delicious. Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly. It's just a great family operated business. The pricing is amazing too, very fair and far less expensive than other \"faster food\" restaurants.",

The owner said that the wallnut shrimp was lightley breaded and was simalar to tbe shrimp that we wanted which they were out of. Once the shrimp came out it was lying on an unappetizing bed of dry, crusty rice noodeles. The shrimp was very heavily breaded WAY to sweet. It was Covered in a thick, mayonaise-like sause. It was simply a dish that nobody could eat. When we told the owner of the store that it was something that we could not eat  he took the plates and slammed them together leaving the the rice noodeles all over the tables and in our drinks. What was originally  going to be an enjoyable family dinner ended up being a list of complaints.  The forturne cookies and water were the only things to be looked apon with optimisim.",

I had the Salt and Pepper Crispy Chicken and asked if I can substitute the rice for steamed veggies. The gentleman said yes. My total was $8.00 and I took my order to go and waited for a few minutes until a gentleman walked over to hand me my bagged order which had soy sauce, napkin, fork, menu, and a fortune cookie.

I ordered 4 different things off the menu, way different - but in the end it was just sticky and quite tasteless. The chicken was rubbery, which sucked because 3 our of 4 items was chicken. The flavors was bland and consistency wise it was just not appealing.   None of my party enjoyed it. Maybe some people like this place, but i am far from a fan. Too bad, because I really wanted to like it too.",

I always felt like they were trying to copy Pei Wei but now they offer some different choices. I picked one that sounded good and to my surprise the person taking my order informed me that the sauce was a bit bland and in a round about way suggested that I order something else. I said I liked spicy so he suggested the Kung Pao chicken. This ended up being pretty bland and flavorless so I can't image how bad the other dish would have been.  At the time we went (around 8pm on a Thursday) it was pretty dirty and service was not that great. I do believe that their food is somewhat healthier than some other places so if I was in the mood for some fast food Chinese then I would return. However, I really don't get why some Yelpers seem to think this place is all that.",

My friend Vicky T. had tried this out and I know she has good taste, she's my friend.   It was pretty busy when I came in and I grabbed a menu as I waited in line.  It's the same premise as Pei Wei.  You order and they bring it to your table.  They guys in the kitchen were working fast and furious to get things out.  I wasn't sure what I wanted so the young women asked me a few questions and made some suggestions.  I went with chicken broccoli and brown rice.  It came to my table about 5 minutes later, piping hot and fresh.  It was delish!!!  The broccoli was cooked perfectly, still a bit crisp, and the chicken was so tender.  The sauce used was also very good, a nice combination of a liitle sweet and a little sour with a small bit of heat.  Ya, I know, but I'm a wimp when it comes to heat.  I devoured it all!    I watched as a steady stream of people came in, most got their food to go. The price point is about on par with Pei Wei too. I spent $10 for my lunch and a drink that was refillable. This was quality food and fast! This is a great spot, a local business, and I loved it!  Support local and go try it!!",

After reading the many great reviews on Tott's Asian diner my family and I decided to give this place a try. We ordered 3 plates of orange chicken with steamed rice and fried rice and also 2 pork egg rolls. The total came out to around $31.00. It was the most DISAPPOINTING Chinese food we have EVER tried in our entire lives. It literally made all of us sick to our stomachs after forcing ourselves to eat at least half of it since we paid for it. It was very very dry and the meat was extremely chewy. I had to chew it 100 times in my mouth because I felt like I would choke if I hadn't. The taste was stale and the fried rice was rubbery and lacked flavor. I do not recommend this place to anyone. Waste of money and left my family and I feeling nauseous!",

    "text": "Tott's is some of the best Chinese food in the area. It's insanely affordable, large portions, and NOT the hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop, lighted-pictures-of-the-menu-on-wall-against-a-floral-backdrop style place you've read about in Fortune Cookie Chronicles. (Which is a fantastic read if you like Chinese food & history.)  Instead, it's clean and modern inside, and Young, the insanely nice owner or brother-in-law of owner, is always very kind and generous and funny, to boot.  Now, the food. You'll need to check the menu before you order to make sure they have everything you're used to. While most Chinese restaurants all pick from the same playcard, Tott's bills itself as an \"asian diner\" and so standbys like moo shu pork are absent. To flesh things out, they add a handful of curries and some other pan-asian dishes you wouldn't normally see. (In the same vein, delivery service is also absent!)  Now that that's out of the way, ignore everything I just said and order the orange chicken. It is the best I have EVER had. (I make sure to order it \"not crispy\" since the shards-of-chicken approach is UNpleasant to me, which they abide by perfectly.) When it comes out fresh and uncrispy, there is no greater. It is just a bit spicy and has some red chile-type things in the sauce, so be prepared, or ask them to tone it down, but it comes out fresh, and hot, and amazing.   Their chow mein is also fantastic. It's chow mein as it should be: soft noodles, not dry at all, and with tons of vegetables. I have them throw in shrimp, and they always include a big portion of just-right cooked shrimp.  I usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs. They're a bit light on the \"crab\" side, and might be \"krab\", but the flavor is amazing and their sweet and sour sauce is fantastic. Some of my favorite cheese puffs, pretty much ever.  If you dare order the pork rolls, a word of warning: they are an entire meal in and of themselves. They are the about as thick as your arm and there are two of them, served with sweet & sour mixed with spicy mustard. They are so big that they have to rubber band the foam container.  The portions are huge for dinner, and at about $11 each, you EASILY have two meals out of them.  Take the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food. And if you ask Young for the orange chicken, not crispy, don't be surprised if he thinks you're me. (That's usually how he recognizes me!)",

    "text": "OMG TOTT'S IS BACK?! thank you Yelpers for letting me know. I found out Tott's left when I went on Yelp to leave an awesome, overdue review. Let me just say that I was devastated when they closed down and every time I craved chinese food, I thought about Tott's and fell into a slight depression.   This place is amazing because of the food and the very friendly customer service. The food is delicious and does not leave you with that \" i ate so much, i need to throw up\" feeling. The food isn't dripping with grease like most asian places.  The owner is such a nice man. I came here often when I was pregnant and everything sounded so good, I couldn't stop ordering. The owner (who i call Mr. Totts) would tell me to not order so much because the servings were so big. LOL who does that? He made me stop spending money, I appreciated that. Anyways, even after I had the baby, he still recognized us and remembered what we usually ordered. I love that.   Thanks for coming back to us Tott's. Life is complete again.",

    "text": "Passed by Tott's many times and finally decided to try it.  The menu has a good mix of various Asian fare, i.e. Chinese, Thai, Korean, etc.  There are a good number of spicy choices so I was happy.  We ordered wanton soup, Tom Yom soup, spicy stir fry with chicken and Singapore Noodles with chicken.  The wanton soup was loaded with veggies and shrimp (4) but tasted \"fishy\" to our son.  He only ate the wantons and a bit of the broth.  The Tom Yom soup was huge with tomatoes, tofu and shrimp.  It was very red in color which I'd never seen before.  The broth was somewhat thick, but very tasty with a good hot and sour zing.  The Singapore Noodles came very quickly as did the spicy stir fry.  Both were very generous portions, enough that we took some of each home. The noodles had just the right amount of curry flavor and the chicken was tender and tasty.  I'd ordered my stir fry extra spicy and I wasn't disappointed!  Overall we were very satisfied.  The price was very reasonable, food was good, staff attentive, and restaurant was clean.  My only criticisms are that the main courses came immediately after the soup so we had it all on the table at once and there was too much tofu in the Tom Yom soup.",

I ordered Kung Pao Chicken as spicy as they could make it.  The owner rang us up and asked who ordered the extra spicy and make sure I had water.  He was right!  Most places are afraid to make it as spicy as I like it, but not TOTTS.. Thumbs up for that.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered, even my picky 9-yr old who had the pan fried noodles with chicken.  The only minor complaint came from my brother in-law who said it was saucy.  Then he proceeded to eat the whole thing.  One thing keeping them from getting 5-stars is the tip jar at the counter.  I get tips at a service type meal, but not to give me my food and take my money.  Overall, it was great and we'll keep going back!",

I've tried a few different items, but my favorite dish is the Pan Fried Noodles served with beef.  The mixture of the noodles covered with beef, veggies and the oyster sauce is terrific. This item is FANTASTIC in my opinion! Each time I finish the dish, I wish I had more!   The staff is super nice and always go over your order to make sure you receive the items you requested.  One item that I've tried that I wasn't keen on was the Tom Yum Soup. The soup was spicy, but was about it. Nothing filling about it.  The food has always came quickly when I've dined in. Both times I've picked up for carryout, the food was ready as advertised. The food is usually ready for pick up within 10 minutes of your order.   The prices are very reasonable. Each main dish is generally between $6.50 and $9.00. Items with seafood will be a bit more expensive, maybe a bit over the $9 mark  A very good meal for under $10 (excluding drink)",

They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor.",

I have to admit, i was very satisfied and it changed my whole way of thinking about fusion restaurants.  I ordered the Singapore noodles with shrimp/chicken xtra spicy.  It was SPICY and loved it.  Usually when i order xtra spicy, it does not even make me sweat but theirs did :)  It was very flavorful and not greasy at all.  My only complaint was it needed more vegetables to balance out with the amount of noodles which is enough for plenty of leftovers.  My wife and kids ordered the Orange chicken which is another one of my querks as to me is not authentic chinese and is under the same category as General Tso.  Again i put my peeves aside and focused on whether or not it just tasted good.  I have to admit, i think i ate more of it than my Singapore noodles.  This place taught me a lesson in my food snobbery which i need to change and follow the words of Andrew Zimmern:  \"If it taste good....eat it\".  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes like the crispy beef and their curry dishes.",
