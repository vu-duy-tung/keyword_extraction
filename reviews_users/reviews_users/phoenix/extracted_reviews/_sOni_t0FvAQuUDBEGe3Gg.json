    "text": "This is a fun place to have a drink almost any night.  There is a very friendly vibe here.  It's not the kind of place you want to go if you are feeling antisocial.  And it's not the kind of place to go if you want to get rowdy.  I strongly disagree with the other review that said it's a rowdy crowd.  It's very friendly, open, and outgoing.  But \"rowdy\" would make it sound aggressive or violent, and I've never felt that vibe here.  If you sit outside or at the bar, you're going to end up chatting with people sitting next to you.  The staff is friendly, and usually pretty quick.  And the bartenders are always helpful, and willing to let you order things that other places might give you a hard time about (black and tan that's heavy on the black, or a mixed drink with any special instruction).  The bouncer is the coolest guy, but will not put up with anyone giving the staff or other customers a hard time.  If it weren't for him, I could see this place being rowdy.  He sort of sets the feel for the place, and does a great job.  It's not like he's never had to throw someone out, but he does and will the instant someone seems disruptive.  The live bands are usually good.  And when there isn't a band, the jukebox has a very wide range of music.  If you don't like what's playing, give it 5 minutes and you probably will like the next song.  And I've never had anything to eat here that I didn't think was great.  The thing I can think of that might be negative is parking.  But that's True of most places downtown Phoenix, so it doesn't really count against them.",

I was a little surprised that this place was legitimately an Irish dive bar (not that I'm an expert on Irish dive bars). For some reason I had this idea in my head that this was gonna be one of these places that calls itself \"Irish\" and a \"dive,\" but is actually kind of \"cheesy.\" I don't know why I thought this (location maybe?), but I just did.   Anywho, there's not much to say about the place. There's live music, which I like. There's a small patio for smokers, which is nice for them. The bartenders & drink prices are decent enough. Me and another friend did try and order food, but it was after midnight and the kitchen was closed. I won't knock them for this, since most bar/restaurants close there kitchens early.   When I'm back in Phoenix I wouldn't hesitate to come here again.",

The only thing to avoid at Seamus is their fried appetizers, they have no taste. Service was quite prompt and friendly. Overall, a great place to hang out after work for a beer and a bite.",

Seriously dive/irish pub bars are known for really REALLY drunk people (not saying that what I saw here, just saying in general) and those stairs up to the bathroom and down to come back have to have had at least a small army of boozers piled at the bottom at one time... those things just look like a bad time is about to happen. But other than that Its a great place exactly what you would expect from a irish pub.. and I might be in love",

They were just like every other frozen popper that I've come to despise. I was tempted to walk back and return them.   When put on the spot about a menu item...don't lie to me- that's just annoying as hell. The bar itself seemed pretty cool, and probably pretty hopping on the weekend evenings.",

    "text": "This is one of those places that I have driven by more times than I can count and always go \"I want to try that place\" but never do because it's not near where I'm going. And maybe that's the only thing that I could consider a bit of a negative, their location is just not the best for us locals. But that seems to be changing as the surrounding neighborhood is beginning to draw more and more reasons to go there.  For me, it was the opening of the new Hilton Garden hotel across the street. Frankly I wish it wasn't called a Hilton so I wouldn't have to explain in the next breath that we chose to stay there because it's NOT like any other Garden Inn ... it's a restored Art Deco building turned INTO a Hilton.  And staying there I can't imagine a better place to wander off to than Seamus McCaffrey's Irish Pub!  This was New Year's eve, and the pub was one of the few places anywhere that wasn't packed to overflowing with revelers. They had a modest $5 cover charge in place because there was live entertainment (compare that to $50-$100 covers some bars try to sock to you on New Years).  We didn't plan to stay (and didn't) but just to have dinner. So we got there about an hour before the band started to play.  I have never had Irish Boxty and as soon as I saw it on the menu it sounded great on a cold winter's night. Mine was the Steak & Guinness and my dining companion had the Corned Beef & Cabbage. Both were humungous portions for only about ten bucks (see photos).  Beer, at $5 each was cheap as well, especially considering what they could have gotten away with on this party night.  Okay, I admit, even before having a beer I was in love with this place. The first and foremost thing it has going for it is that it's not a chain!!!!!  Woohoo.  I pretty much detest chain (or theme) restaurants, and at first glance I could tell this was not one.  It reminded me of my favorite drinking hole (also an Irish bar) when I was just starting out in Chicago, and also reminded me of a favorite (Irish pub) in San Diego. Notice a theme here?  Irish bars don't have to be pretentious, so why make them?  Which brings me to the food.  I'm not going to rave about it or use a lot of fancy words or call Guy Fieri and tell him to get his butt over here to try this dive.  This is not Cordon Bleu, folks, this is pub grub so don't get snooty about it. No it wasn't the best meal I've ever had, but it was hot, filling and tasted awesome. And there was a LOT of it on the plate for the price!  The band started, the partiers started partying and, guess what, it started sounding like an Irish pub. Lots of great craic. Lots of people bumping in to each other. Lots of people singing to the music.  It is very hard to find places like this in Phoenix, Arizona and I'm glad I finally did. I love this place.",

Having been there myself. So today I ordered the French did which is supposed to be shaved prime rib. Idk about that it's the same meat for the cheese steak. If I made it at home I would have had at least medium done meat. But why should I expect better then from home ? Well that's just it...I should for the for the cost of $13.50. I can get a 1/2 pound burger for $13.00. So after all that had it been 10 bucks I wouldn't be writing this. For that cost there is no reason that I should have more bread then meat and not great bread at that.  Flavor was good but no where near $13.50 worth.  So great place to drink but maybe not value place for food.",

The wait staff was very attentive and it was a reasonable $5.50 for a pint of Stongbow cider.   Seamus loses a star for having the worst bathrooms EVER! The god-awful stench as you ascend the stairs is enough to make your eyes water and pass out from holding your breath.

    "text": "I'm going to go out on a limb here and give Seamus McCaffrey four solid stars. Given that I don't really like pubs or pub food, I think that four stars is a pretty high rating.   My rating is based on three major things about the place:   1. The outdoor smoking patio with high tables is really nice if you like to smoke when you drink. It's small but certainly serves its purpose. If you don't like being around smoke, you won't agree with this reason. But you have been forewarned and you can feel free to discount my review.   2. The patrons are a really interesting mix of people. When my husband and I went for happy hour, we saw business men in suits and pony-tailed, t-shirt-clad bikers alike enjoying themselves and relaxing after a hard day at work.   3. Maybe I haven't been too enough pubs to know any better, but I really felt like this place had some heart to it--maybe not soul, but certainly heart. When we went for happy hour, I felt like I was hanging out somewhere that had personality (something I can't say about pretty much every other place I've been downtown). While fun, chic, upscale bars have their appeal, sometimes it's nice to just enjoy a beverage in the comfort of a spot that's a bit more real.   Well, folks, these are my reasons. I fully accept that they may not appeal to you, but if anything I've said strikes a cord and you're looking for a chill place to hang out downtown, check Seamus McCaffrey out.",

I was able to find something veg to eat - Potato Skins, sans bacon.  The service was acceptable overall, but the waitress went out of her way to make sure that I was happy.  When the skins came out with bacon, she had the kitchen remake them right away.  I had to knock off one of the stars because Seamus' is a little bit dirty.

Last night I was at the opening night of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE. After spending about 30 minutes at the cast party, my friends and co-workers decided to wander elsewhere for another drink (or two). A few suggestions were tossed out, ranging from sports bars to hotel bars, but I recommended Seamus McCaffrey's and held to my suggestion strongly. So off we went.   The times I have been there before were fine. Great. Lovely. No complaints.  Then last night we had the most grouchy waitress I have ever met in my life, both in person and created by a writer on TV or in a movie. Seriously. She was so completely unaccomodating and rude, that I don't think I will ever think of Seamus McCaffrey's the same way.   Isn't it odd how one experience can affect them all?   It really is a fun place to go for a drink, so please do try it out. And, there was great live music last night that I enjoyed immensely.",

Its organized far too much like a restaurant and not enough like a pub, which sucks when all you want to do is cozy up to the bar and all the stools are taken.  The beer selection is fine, pretty typical, though i haven't dabbled in their scotches.  Just not the type of place I'd want to drink fine scotch, anyway.  Their smoking patio is cool if you get a sizable group together and you can complain about how dead downtown is and be irritated by the construction of Monroe 44.    I think once their highrise neighbor is established this bar will get much more lively and won't have that dreaded \"am I the only person drinking in downtown\" feeling that i always get there.    As mentioned on this page, its a good spot to grab and drink and go but not really a place to blow it out all night.",

Drinks were on the pricier side,  especially for a cocktail. We got the recommendation from a restaurant owner who said it was better then Rose & Crown, which we were looking for. They had a live band that was playing,that was kinda cool  It wasn't too hard to find, because the place next door had strobe lights and loud electronic thumping music and the pub was next more and much more quiet. Good thing bc the music next door was as cheesy as the douchey guys standing in the patio smoking, so we prob would've left",

They serve 18 year old Jameson and it is amazing. The fish and chips are really good, too. They have a good beer selection, one you would expect from an Irish pub. There are live bands that play traditional Irish music, a cozy dining room and patio tables and chairs right outside if you prefer to smoke and drink. The service has always been good and the staff is pretty friendly. Parking is a little tough sometimes since it is right downtown. Seamus' is always a great time, friendly crowds and great drinks.",

    "text": "Last night a colleague and I went to Twitter's Phoenix Friday Nights at this irish pub downtown. The location was easy to find, and for a Friday night it was a well balanced pub without too many people (as you can sometimes see in downtown bars on the weekends) but enough that it didn't look empty. It wasn't too loud but still had good activity, which made it great for a group meeting.  The full bar looked impressive and a bit authentic as you'd see in Ireland. The bars on the menu were well balanced with different types that I enjoy. I order a few half and halfs Guinness/Strongbow which were really good. After awhile the food people were eating around me looked really good, so I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. I enjoy this meal at many places, so I figured I'd try it here. The waitress was very amenable and highly recommended this meal.  When it arrived, the layer of potatoes was very thing and the cheese was sprinkled across the top instead of layered nicely. The meal was too hot so I had to wait quite a bit to begin eat it. When I forked into it, it was definitely tasty but thing and there wasn't a ton to it. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but I just expected more.  The wait staff was great, and since we had about a dozen people and they had to weave between us, they were great. We loved the staff. Nice people, good beer, ok food..",

We live next door to Seamus McCaffrey's and when we moved in, it was a good news / bad news situation: you live next door to a bar but it's an Irish pub. Oh well. We tried it, of course and have now stopped in at least once a week for a pint or two after work.  I can't speak to the food, but the bar is great for drinking. Plenty of seating at the long bar and a really nice selection of beers on tap (and reasonably priced too, especially if you go to the 3-6 happy hour). The really surprising part of this bar is the amazing selection of whisky. I have never seen a better variety of Scotch, Irish, and Bourbon. The other thing that is exciting about this great selection is that the prices seem to reflect availability and not necessarily cost (for instance, some of the one-off, independently bottled scotchs are pretty expensive, but Lagavulin 16 year is around $8 a glass!). Overall, a great neighborhood bar and worth stopping in if you want to grab a pint in downtown.",

It's a dive in downtown. Has that older (though a bit musty feel). I love all the trinkets at the bar and pictures on the wall. Obviously Seamus could use some new tables, bathrooms and carpet, but I don't expect this place to snazz up and become something it isn't. I find sitting at the bar to be the most fun area here.   Beers on tap are cold, they pour a Guinness right, have wine, and have large pours on hard liquor. Small patio out front can certainly be fun for some people watching! Sometimes they have live music, which certainly peps the place up. There is always an upbeat feel here. A vibe of people having fun. Varied crowd and I have always felt safe and comfortable. Be careful if you use the restrooms upstairs. The stairs are rickety, steep and I tend to feel like the toilet is going to fall through the floor. It hasn't yet! (knock on the wood the bar is made of).   Diverse menu with decent food. Always friendly service. Certainly not a place I would ever turn down going to. Just not my #1 pick for a night out. More like my #10. :)   Cheers!",

She complained a lot about having to deal with a large group (despite the fact that it also probably meant a large tip), as well as a number of other things.

I ask the server, she says that IS an Irish coffee, and that the bartender thinks so too. I say, no, an Irish Coffee is Irish whiskey in coffee with a little cream floated on top (and back in the day at Seamus, a little creme de menthe drizzled on).  She says she's never heard of such a thing but they could make me one \"if I wanted it that way.\"    (May I also say that, prior to the Irish coffee incident, she told me that my Black and Tan was actually called a \"Half and Half\" at Seamus's.

Along the bar they have patches from different law enforcement agencies.  Because of the downtown location, there are often meetings and conferences for law enforcement agencies.  They donate a patch to this bar.  I have seen patches from all over the country, including federal agencies.      The food is typical bar fare, with an Irish theme (go figure).  Some of the food is delicious, like the burger.  However, the Cobb salad leaves in a little to be to be desired.   Overall this is one of my favorite pubs in the Phoenix area.

I started off the evening with a delicious and refreshing tall glass of the one and only Guiness beer, off the tap of course.  It was amazing as usual.  5 stars.  Next I ordered a shepard's pie, which I'd actually been craving for quite some time.  When it came to me I knew there was going to be some problems.  It was tiny, and looked like something I could whip up in my kitchen in no more than 5 min.  And I guess that's all they did in the back of the bar, with little to no effort, it tasted as much.  Minus one star.  I was still hungry, so I decided to order another meal figuring it was still early and I could just eat the leftovers for dinner.  I elected the corned beef and cabbage.  5 min later I received an impostor.  This was no corned beef I've ever seen.  It was instead a shaved meat that tasted kinda like it, with obviously CANNED potatoes, surrounded with an abundance of cabbage and now I'm upset.  Minus two stars.  This is a PUB, NOT A RESTAURANT.  Guiness was great, food sucked big time.",

The staff is awesome, the atmosphere is welcoming and for a bar, their food is just awesome!! On Fridays they usually have a band playing and there hasn't been one that I haven't liked yet. Which is pretty rare. Only gripe about that is that its a fairly small bar and so when the band plays its extremely loud, to the point you can't really talk to your people when they play. On Friday and Saturday nights it gets really busy so I suggest getting there before 10PM or you might have a hard time finding a seat inside. Minor gripes, still deserving of the 5 stars though! Cheers!",

I only gave this 3 stars because it completely let me down tonight when I had food delivered. Normally the food is exactly what you expect from a pub--heavy comfort food that hits the spot if you're out drinking. It also has one of my favorite chef salads. Tonight I had a salad delivered for tomorrow and a beef stew delivered for dinner tonight. I've traveled in Ireland and the Irish excel at comfort soups and stews.   What I got tonight was sincerely bad. It was insanely over salted and heavily congealed. I picked out the three pieces of meat, two carrot slices, and one potato bit and left the remaining salty jelly for my begging dog. Even she didn't get past a couple of licks. Bad, bad. I expect better for both the price and the heritage of the dish.   There is a rivalry between Seamus' and George and Dragon. GND got its little feelers in a bunch over my review and asked for it to be taken down. I will say one thing...at least GND accurately reflects the horrible, bland, heavy food of the English...quite a low bar. The Irish have much better food and a correspondingly higher bar. Damnit, Seamus', I root for you in this!  You can do better...please do.",

What I experienced was mashed potatoes with enough gravy for flavor no meat in about 4 sweet peas. So basically I paid $13 for mashed potatoes. I will never eat there again, never.Typical loud bar scene. Very disappointed!!",

However, there are some things that make this place, just ok.  I've been here 3 times and it seemed like the same band was there each time. They weren't playing anything Irish and the singer wasn't very good. I could live with that, if the sound wasn't turned up so loud that I couldn't have a conversation.  Some nights were better than others. If you're with a group and wanna do Irish Car bombs and not have any conversation, come down on the weekend. If you wanna talk and have a couple drinks in a nice Irish place, maybe come on a weekday.   The food is basically just bar food. They do have a decent selection of whiskeys and scotch, however the beer leaves a bit to be desired in the variety department.   All in all, I stop in here once in a while when i'm downtown, but I don't really go out of my way to track it down, especially with healthy amount of bars downtown has to offer.",

Very friendly and Pleasant staff took care of us the subsequent three days. There is a mixed crowd of people. They have tables indoors and out.

On the one hand, the bar is well stocked with Irish beers on tap and all the associated \"Look we're Irish!\" crap, just like Rosie McCaffrey's.  From first impressions, I thought it was an iffy place trying a little too hard, but I must confess that I've spent some great nights holed up with a load of friends drinking in one of the corner booths.  Prices are pretty standard, around $5 for an import pint.  The food is good and they tend to keep the kitchen open fairly late (10:30 or so).    Still, the overall impression is of a place that's uncomfortably straddling the line between bar and restaurant.  Not quite homey enough to feel like a real Irish pub and without the eccentricities of the Bikini Lounge or even Bar Bianco.  Not really close to Casey Moore's or Rula Bula in terms of Irishness.",

The bar area is a bit tight and very loud. It's nearly impossible to have a conversation. The music is decent, though as someone else mentioned, very little of it is Irish. On my last visit, I realized the drink prices are high and the bartenders, perhaps not trustworthy.  My friend had opened our tab and thorughout the night I had 2 drinks while he had 4 - that's a TOTAL of 6 drinks, all wells. After closing the tab, he came over and told me the total bill - $60!!!!  I marched up to the bar to see how that could be and found they had added 4 more drinks to the tab, as well as charging an extra 1$ per drink because we'd asked for them tall (meaning a little more soda - most places don't charge for this). The bartender did not want to go through the hassle of voiding the CC transaction and instead said he'd refund us cash. The first refund was only for 2 drinks so we went back to ask about the rest. He said \"oops\" and gave us a refund for the other 2. We gave up and left at that point, but there still was no refund on the added $1 for those for drinks or the total tip which was based on a $60 bill that should have been $36.   I may be venting more than reviewing now, but take heed here and review your bill before paying it!",

I was also charged for two drinks that night when I ordered one drink and after much debate I was given a \"complimentary\" drink, which was not really free since I had already paid for an extra drink.

    "text": "The bar/building/atsmophere/service good. The food, well eeeewwww. I have no eating disorder but I have tried to pruge the Potato cake Steak, Mushroom Guiness sauce meal out of my belly. And not because it was rotten, but because it was that bad. The cake was decent. However, I think they went to Denny's to get the can o' sauce. Seriously the last time time I had food this bad was when my mom dragged me to Denny's 6 years ago. If this food didn't come out of a ten gallon can marked \"Irish Food\" I would be shocked. It tasted as if they made a pan out of a salt lick, pored in Cambells \"something\" mix and let it soak up the chemicals and salt for days. Eat at Mcdonalds before you come here, then enjoy the bar.",

    "text": "With the two restaurants closest to the Dodge Theatre not serving alcohol (you know who you are....bastards!),  finding Seamus McCaffrey's before the Margaret Cho show was like finding an EZ Bake Oven under the tree Christmas morning. Complete joy! I really don't know downtown so when we turned the corner and saw a bunch of smokers shwilling pints on the sidewalk, we ran like school girls chasing Zac Efron. Quickly and with our tongues out. We were thirsty and ready to catch a buzz before the show. Inside it was sort of narrow with a long bar on one side and scads of tables throughout. We spied an open table on the \"patio\" and were told we could nab that and our server would be right out. And she was. Delightful and speedy. We ordered two Stellas and a couple shots. Didn't see any food, but perused a pretty big menu. Usual fare with approachable prices. Thank you, though, Seamus, cuz the group on the \"patio\" was much more entertaining than Ms. Cho!",

    "text": "Hello!  I rarely will write a review about an establishment as I work in the industry and detest yelp. But I was asked to look into a certain review made here by kelvin h.   I have been coming to this bar for over 5 years. I started when I was around 24. I would come into the bar before my POS210 class and get two vodka sodas because the class was unbearable sober.  Let me start with the things I like.   I love that I can walk inside on a Monday morning and Dana will shout, \"Hey sugarplum!\"   I like that Malydia will let me smoke with her even though I know she is stressed from hearding waitresses and bartenders into position.   I like that I called Mike \"Matt\" for 3 years and he would just smile and ask me what I'm drinking.   I like that Liz always makes me feel like I'm a little brother that she hasn't seen and honestly listens to my adventures. Truly interested.   I like that I can talk to Brandon about dogs, mustaches, and ponytails, and he never mentions my poor shaving routine.   I love that the security always has my safety in mind and talks to me like I'm just as important as a celebrity looking for a reprieve from all the madness.   I like that Randy will come out from out behind a busy bar to hug me and ask, \"hey buddy. How are you?\"  I like that Jessa wants me to stay so she can finish her side work and grab a drink with me on the patio.   Most of all I like that when I'm inside Seamus I'm not a \"fag\", a \"sissy\" or \"unwanted\" I'm valued. And kelvin h. That feels pretty good.   Did I mention I'm gay. Oh yeah I forgot, I guess the staff here did too. They know me as Mattie.   Please patron this establishment and show them the same respect they bestow on you.   -Mattie",

I never had anything that I didn't enjoy and that wasn't tasty.  If you are in downtown and want a place to eat and drink, come here.

The bartender was great- even gave us his personalized mini-map of the area with all his bar recommendations. Very cool! We came back after the show and it was rammed, but the staff was still friendly and we had hardly any wait at the bar, event though we were standing 4 people back.  Great place!",

But, I've never liked my experiences here and maybe I just have higher standards but I'd rather go to any number of places for lunch or happy hour.   The issues start with the fact that Seamus is dirty, dusty, and has terrible food, warm beer and pretty terrible service. I just had lunch again here Friday and we had to wait over an hour for a couple salads and appetizers. It's honestly the worst.   The place hasn't been upgraded or had any money put into fixing it up in decades- it's just subpar in every way. And every time I see dirt or dust and have to use their rundown bathrooms I can't help but think - if this is how they maintain the areas customers see, what about the place my food is prepared?",

Rosie's and Hanratty's aren't too far behind but if you are downtown, Seamus is the place to get yourself a Guiness.  There is always a sea of quirky customers to befriend and the service is fast.  The bands that play do some killer covers and Irish whiskey keeps the spirits high.    Downsides:  Faint smell of urine and it can sometimes be a sausage-fest.  But who cares?  You go here to get drunk and have a laugh with good company.",

We sat ourselves and a server came over almost immediately to take our drink order. We looked over the menu and all of us decided on burgers.  We ordered mozzarella sticks to begin but place or meal order at the same time.  Unfortunately the server came back out to tell us they had run out of mozzarella sticks so we left it at just the burgers.  I ordered the Seamus pub burger with no extras (cheese, avocado and bacon are all extra charges) but I did upgrade to the onion rings instead of steak fries.  The burger as delicious with a great char taste that gave the burger that little something extra in the taste. The vegetables on the burger were crisp and fresh which also attributed to the yummyness. The onion rings were good but not necessarily worth the $2 upcharge. They were also just above room temperature.  Hubby ordered the garlic parmesan burger and said it was delicious. He got cottage cheese as his side and that was up to his liking.  Our daughter ordered the Western burger and she said it was one of the better Western burgers she's had. I smoked the BBQ sauce from the burger and it was slightly spicy with a great smoky taste to it. She got the steak fries which were good but I would have preferred a crispier outside. They were however very hot when they came to the table.  Drinks weren't filled as quickly as I would like but once we asked they were filled quickly.  Parking can be tricky as it is located downtown. We parked in the first spot we found and then walked to the restaurant.  A few missteps (no cheese sticks, lukewarm onion rings, slow refills) but I would give this place another chance only because the burgers were so delicious.",

They have this shot called the \"apple pie\" shot which was absolutely delicious! It was apple cider, with cinnamon sticks, brown sugar, and everclear and it tastes soooo sweet! Too bad I heard they stopped making them anymore. That was literally their best drink there!  The live music is cool! The food is so-so here. I've had a burger and fries there, and some tater tots and it mostly tasted like cafeteria food! My suggestion is that you eat somewhere else first, then go here to meet up with friends and drink!

    "text": "This is my go-to \"no thought/effort required\" bar choice when in Downtown Proper. It never fails - no matter what I happen to be downtown for, dinner at Hanny's, a sports event, a LR adventure, a night at PHX Art (if I'm driving, it's not walking distance from the museum) - and we need a place to have a few beers or cocktails before or after, Seamus is easy and effortless. It's never a destination, but it always gets a visit. Here's why:  The bartenders are always friendly and efficient Prices are reasonable Good draught beer selection Seating is usually available Atmosphere is lively and suitable for one-on-one or group situations There's a jukebox There's food, and it's also reasonably priced for its quality There's a small patio for the smokers out front It's walking distance to most downtown hot spots  There's something to be said for having a Seamus in your pocket when you just want a no-frills pub drink in a friendly atmosphere. It's hard to explain but this place really creates that laid-back old tavern/pub feeling that so many (SO MANY) bars try to reproduce and end up just being another generic bar. I think Christine O. says it best in her review: this place has heart and personality.",

Both meals were tasty and filling, and paired with a Kilt Lifter, the perfect lunch.

I'm not expecting the quality of fish and chips I experienced in Ireland but I've been to pubs state-side who can do it a lot better than Sesamus McCaffrey's. The breading is very heavy and oily. You can tell they either came out of a bag and fried or a very heavy hand was used with a flour-based bredding. Beer batter makes for a lighter, crispier batter which is a fish and chips signature, and this dish doesn't fit the bill.  The potatoe skins wern't much better. Tasted out of a bag with some cheese and bacon bits (not real bacon pieces) thrown on top with a side of sour cream.  The tables felt really crowded together. The person's chair behind me was touching mine which made dinner awkward. Either the chairs were very low or the tables were high because I felt like I was sitting very low in relation to the table.   I will give them credit for a very nice server and having some local beers on tap. I would say skip the food and come here for a few beers.",

    "text": "We looked forward to visiting this place after seeing the menu online.  First the good part... the food.  Portions were \"normal\", and came out in a timely fashion, but we were there during a slow period. There were 2-3 people at the bar and three tables (including us).  Now for the bad.  Since we were there during happy hour, we asked about their HH drink specials.  My husband selected a beer and I asked about the white wine.  Our waitress replied that they had a house Chardonnay.  I asked if they had a different house white besides Chardonnay, like a Sauvignon Blanc, she said \"yeah\".  Once she brought our drinks and meal, she pretty much forgot about us, in favor of flirting with a guy at the bar.  Even someone from another table had to go up to the front to ask for their bill because she forgot about them, too.  Halfway through the meal we sat with long empty drink glasses trying to waive her over and finally got the attention of a bartender. Of course she was quick to get to that other table to see if she had a tip waiting!  At the close of the meal, our bill showed that we were charged $8 per glass of wine.  I asked her why we were charged $8 and she left for a few minutes.  Then she came back with a wine menu (which we had never seen before) and pointed out the different wines on the menu and that the Sauvignon Blanc was $8 (which she could not pronounce correctly). I repeated to her our previous conversation, how I was inquiring about the HH wine special.  So why on Earth didn't she say that the Sauvignon Blanc was not a part of the HH special???  She just looked down, said she was sorry but she didn't hear me say HOUSE just \"white wine\" and that she didn't know what else to do.  Awkward silence.... for a long time. If that's how they want to play it, fine. What would have been her tip simply ended up in the hands of the restaurant.  There are other places to go with great food and servers who know their job and deserve their tips.",

How can you mess up Shepherd's pie? It was similar to Sloppy Joes or Hamburger Helper? Hey, maybe it's Sloppy Joe Hamburger Helper???The Chicken Boxty was not bad with big chunks of bell pepper-yum-but I think I detected a tinny flavor to the chicken. I wonder if they buy Chicken-in-a-Can @ Costco. Seriously??? The waitress STILL is not back!  Okay, I've simmered down since I originally drafted this.

    "text": "So, it's your typical Irish style pub, dark, dank, loud w/plenty of seating in a side section, and typical long straight bar stools.  The locals made it interesting and fun, I was able to witness some shennanigans one night that was rather comical (see below). the outdoor seating is minimal, but supports a crowd of 15 or so, with mist gently falling from overhead water spouts to keep you cool(er). The staff was great, the bartending on point and the bouncer was able to diffuse a potentially ugly situation. Overall it's one of the best and most hoppin' spots in downtown.  Decent pub style food, large portions, good prices? What more do you need? Oh yeah, brew selection. Good pints w/local flavors on tap, bottles, full hard liquor selection too. A good spot/loction for a few pints if in downtown AZ,   PS SO, sitting outside enjoying a few brews on the solo tip 11pm ish? Three younger shaved headed guys, seriously vocal, decide they need to start chanting F#*K the IRISH, in the pub. The bouncer proceeds to get them out into the street where I witnessed some KnuckleHeadedNess I have not viewed since my college days. One dude says, you know hat time it is? Shirts off! (wishing I had a camera in hand) Then they proceed to scream PUNCH ME! Punch Me!! After 3 or 4 shots it was over, but the whole build up and theatrical show was worth the wait. And the shining knights of young male testostorone jumped into a taxi, off into the night. I was told by the bouncer this is unusual, but like plenty of drinking spots, there's always the potential, it's how you handle it, and he deserves and  A+ and maybe a shiny gold star.",

There always seems to be a group of douche bags at the entry that might be security, might just be guys who are friends with the bar staff.

Either way it was not anything special.   Not a bad place to go to before going to a game or show. It won't be as busy as the spots right down town. If it is busy though, don't wait. You'll only get angry that you waited.",

Food was average bar food, though they do that portion the ketchup thing (rather than have bottles at the table, or brought to the table, they bring out portions in little cups) which I think is silly.  My teriyaki chicken sandwich was just so-s0, but not bad.  There were like 6 people in the whole place, but the service was not all that attentive.  There was some good gossip happening as you could see all the staff clustered together chatting during our entire meal.  Later, the place was much busier, but the service at the bar - just to drink beer - was no better.  I'd go back, but I'd look for someplace as an alternative first.",

    "text": "Let's face it, locals.  Downtown Phx doesn't exactly have a bunch of places you can duck into and call home.  Seamus McCaffrey's is one of those places.  If you've come here for fine cuisine, you'll be disappointed.  The food here is good, not great.  But if you're here, you've usually eaten elsewhere already and are looking to wet your whistle.  And for that, you're in the right place.  Service is quick on all but the busiest nights, prices are reasonable, and the crowd is always fun.  Live bands do perform here fairly often, but their days rotate.  It not unusual to show up one night on week and enjoy a live band's performance, then come back the same night next week and have them not be there.  If live music is what you're after, call first.  Parking in this area is generally a chore, especially around Happy Hour.  Parking spaces can be found a block or so away as night falls, but the best option (as with most anything downtown) is to take the Light Rail and walk the short block to the pub.  In short, it's a very laid-back kind of place.  Like stopping off at a friend's house for a drink and a chat before carrying on with your evening.",

This bar was jumping with locals, live music bounced off the walls and character filled the room.   The bar is divey, it's cozy, it's dark and it's awesome. The drinks are cheap, the patrons are awesome and there's plenty of seating. Downtown Phoenix could use about 15 more types of these bars.   I visited Seam McCaffrey's after a Diamondbacks game and it was so cool to see Downtown Phoenix alive and bustling on a Friday night. This bar is like a little taste of what the entire Downtown Phoenix area could be like if we took every bar and restaurant filled with character like this and placed them on the same block. Having just got back from Chicago, this bar definitely reminded me of the character the Chicago bars have and it really made my night to see it!   So bottoms up Seamus McCaffrey's! You make Phoenix proud!",

Probably has something to do with the generic-ness of its downtown location. \r \r I enjoy myself whenever I'm there but that's more due to present inebriated company than to the establishment itself. Haven't had any of the food there so I can't vouch for their pub grub, but the bartenders are pretty friendly and real patient with some of the more stupored clientele (which includes a few regulars but also a lot of tourists & business travelers staying at nearby hotels). But as far as being an ultimate Irish pub, I'm afriad Seamus isn't it.",

Hungry and slightly pissed that I lost a whole day of my vacation, I vowed to make a night out of it (at least not go straight to my place of lodging). Downtown Phoenix is a maze, not in a good way. Between the one way street, the split lane (due to light rail track) and limited parking, we finally parked at the Chase Tower parking garage (ended up being $6) and walked toward lights and sound.  I saw this place came with high marks on yelp, so while it wasn't topical for my desert vacation, I can't really say no to a good Irish pub.   First impression, great door/security guy.  He checked our IDs, introduced himself and the place (kitchen opens til midnight, drinks til 2am), and said let him know if we need a cab.   We sat ourselves, ordered a pint each ($5.50 for imperial pint, I had Smithwicks Irish ale) and wings and chips and gravy.  I asked for the gravy to come on the side, so I don't know if its normally drenched in it, but even if it is you won't mind, because that's AWESOME gravy!  A small hint of curry, savory, I would have licked the bowl (wait... I did lick the bowl).  Wings were ok, a little too saucy. And the medium has quite a kick.  Service was ok, waitress was a little absent at times but I was in no hurry.  My favorite part of the night was the live music. It's always nice to have an Irish band in an Irish pub. I don't know if it is typical of them to have an Irish live band, but I hope they do.   Solid joint even for a visitor who wasn't expecting a St Paddys take two.",

The location was very convenient - right downtown, just a few blocks from the theater and the light rail. I imagine if I were a visitor at staying at the San Carlos Hotel I would be regularly stopping in for at least a drink.  That said I went for my usual - Fish and Chips. Original, I know. The menu indicated no newspaper - which is fine. I also ordered a draught of Four Peaks magical Kilt Lifter brew. The waiter brought the drink quickly - I had asked if there were any happy hour specials. The special was 50 cents of a draught. Not very happy, is it? So instead of $4.50 for the beer, it was $4. I think I prefer the same brew at San Felipe's in Tempe for $2.25 during happy hour....the size of the fish was good. Two filets - and by filet that is what it looked like - two Filet o' Fish from McDonalds. Just a size comparison - the taste was fine. The fries were good and I had everything I needed. But for me, it wasn't anything fantastic. If you blindfolded me, took me inside and removed the blindfold, I could be at any Irish pub in the city - or any city for that matter. The side dish of cole slaw was not very creamy, but it wasn't bad. All in all, the meal was fine, but just par for the fish & chips course.  The atmosphere was a little interesting - so I didn't mind having a Kilt Lifter in an Irish pub. The tables were regular tables rather than old wooden ones found in many Irish pubs and the music playing was country...Huh? Country in an Irish pub just seemed like an odd combo.   An order of fish & chips along with 2 Kilt Lifters came to just under $18. Again, a little pricey for what was provided for an otherwise average experience.",

It has a typical \"Irish\" pub menu and have bottle beer and draught beer (+1).  I had the fish and chips which the waitress (wait person, waiter, wait staff) told me the this was a signature dish.

I have to say, I'm a sucker for Irish pubs.  I practically live at Fibber Magees after all. I'll start with the good:  The waitress was adorable and attentive.  We never had empty glasses, and the food was served promptly.  The steak and Guinness boxty was amazing, and the Jamison's cake was to die for!  The kids meal quesadilla was big enough to feed 2 kids (mine are 5 and 6 and HUGE eaters) which was good since it was 6..75! The bowl of soup was reasonably priced at 4.95, and the bowl was big! Now for the not so good:  Kind of a hole-in-the-wall.  It could most definitely use some updating.  Every table/chair in the place looked well-worn and some had flat out holes and large rips.  The Guinness was pretty pricey at $6.00, and served in the same glass as the water and iced tea.  The thing that got me the most was the fact that you have to go up and entire flight of stairs to use the restroom!  Now, I'm not the world's most coordinated person, and there's a reason I don't really wear heels anymore, but all I could think of was how many ladies out there wear those crazy 5\" shoes and how easy it would be to have one drink too many and fall down the stairs on your way back from the bathroom!  Also, when you have small children, that's a danger as well.  And if your small children are like mine, then you can't visit any establishment EVER without using the bathrooms! All in all, we had a nice time here, the food was good, and the waitress was cool.  Nothing super-special that would demand I return immediately, but nothing so bad that I'd never come back either.  This place is A-OK!",

I never went there! No judgment on any of the customers as many of them are friends or aquaintences. I don't support places that are managed terribly but then I got the phone call...from the owner. WOW. The reason why that place always looks filthy, or have mentally unstable bartenders and management in training mangers who have no idea what the customer experience is further do not care about the image of the business, or how the bathrooms just look like a drug deal was just done or why the place just looks like a sad afterthought is, drum roll please, The Owner Doesn't Care! It all makes sense. After speaking with him and just letting him know what's happening is his business he immediately became unnecessarily defensive. When asked \"why I was kicked out\" he replied \"because I didn't get kicked out quietly\". Ok 2 + 2 is like 42 that equation. To be clear I got kicked out for wanting an explanation of why I was being escorted out. Ok fine kick me out for asking questions but explain why I was kicked out to begin with?   NO ONE AT THIS PLACE CAN OR HAS OR WILL EVER BE ABLE TO.   He went on to tell me that because I told the female bartender how I truly felt about her as I was being escorted out again for being a customer, that I was 86'd for life.   \"Lol. I don't like Seamus, never have as it one of the worst... (click) \"  He hung up on me. Yup.  As a business owner I would think that if someone who NEVER goes to SEAMUS, actually despises Seamus , a non customer who is going out of there way let him/her know the image.of his business that Is going out by these heavily undertrained staff so much so to get the BBB involved, this is probably something to have an open mind about and look into the situation. And be able to answer very simple questions. If you can't tell me why I was asked to leave it is because I was discrimated against for personal reasons and or views of from your so called \"bartender\". Just man up and say that. Use your head. If she was \"offduty\" why was she calling the shots when I had been seen and waited on by several of the other bartenders? I saw this girl for 3 min and was asked to leave.   He stated \"I have witness's\". I have witnesses as well who are regulars there and witnessed the entire display. He didn't care. This is why you establishment sucks.  You suck. (All due respect)",

I have worked on the other side of the block for the last 4 years.  My office has approximately 40 people and frequently groups of us will order food from here. I have also ordered food from here for my work potlucks.   Today I understand is the busiest and probably most profitable day of the year.  The rudeness I experienced from some of the staff (original server was amazing and super nice) over two $10 wristbands was disappointing.  (We were there when it was free. We had to go back to the office and wanted to return a little while later). They would not give us the wristbands without paying $20.   You just lost multiple regular costumers over $20.   I will not suggest Seamus to my co-workers for lunch again.",

Guinness is positively delightful and I could drink it every day.  The service is polite, the food is very good and the price is reasonable. I couldn't begin to tell you how much I love fish and chips. And Guinness. Maybe that should be my request for a final meal, if I'm ever put on Death Row and the prison offers such a last request.",

I had an Ardbeg, and at $8 it wasn't a horrible price. Beers were good - I had a couple pints of some local Arizona beer as well.  This is truly a hole in the wall type place and is very comfortable. Vintage looking but not run down at all. Great service and welcoming environment. Plus, they actually enforce the no smoking inside which is great!  I would rate at 4.5 stars given the slightly expensive price, but I'll round to 5 just because Arizona is awesome.",

You'll likely hear Bob Barker or see Cliff.  You'll notice the alley or like to call it \"narnia\" for the fact that no one who walks down it ever walks out as the same person.  You can sit on the patio of Seamus and judge the people at Ghost Lounge.  You see life walking around and can do it with a cigarette in one hand and beer in the other.",

We were just spending the night here in Phoenix before our long excursion to the Grand Canyons so we thought we'd check out this city.  There was a huge baseball game, the Cubs and idk the opponent but anyway, before and after this game, people gathered-young and not too old.  lol It was fun whilst a little bit of whisky here and there. Okay, a few... The best part is the live band. They were very versatile in their music choices they played.  Every song they played was a hit and then some requests were also played.  This is an Irish pub and you know how these guys are when they party?  You too will sure join along. Some had a little much end up falling off their chairs but weren't violent though. Just had a little much fun I think and somehow survived until the band was done with their sets.  There's plenty of foods , coffee and not tea but a whole lot of other stuff. Don't miss this when you are in the area. I wish I can remember the band but I don't. Sorry... Hubs and I had an awesome night here.",

Some patrons are just there to drink and chat, but there are tables to sit down and have a meal.  The noise level is such that dinner conversation requires effort and when the live music starts you can pretty much forget any table talk.  This restaurant definitely has character and is usually busy.",

The wings were meaty and had a good flavor. The Irish nachos were amazing! Prices were very decent. My husband enjoyed his whiskey flight.   The lack of 5 stars is not for service but for overall appeal - the entrance was crowded with smokers, the bar was full of loud gentleman cursing and the \"chotzkis\" on the walk were dusty.

It's been around forever, but we've never set foot into it before, although my Beloved has always been curious about it. Although she's a non-drinker, she has this fascination with English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh pubs.    I had the corned beef and cabbage, which was a humongous dish. The meat and cabbage were pretty good, but the dish lacked excitement. The cabbage needed more cooking. I think they should have added some onions and a bit more pepper to it in order to liven it up.  If you're starving, however, you can feed yourself, plus about three other hungry people just with the one plate.    My wife had the Irish beef stew, which she liked quite a bit. When I tasted it, however, it reminded me a bit of Dinty Moore. I liked the notes of celery and tomato in the thick, gravy-like broth. But, just like the corned beef, I felt it needed more of a kick to make it truly outstanding. Some more garlic, maybe a dash of Tabasco, and I think the stew would have stood out more.  The soda bread, however, was something we both liked. We had nice, thick slices which we slathered enthusiastically with the fresh butter.   Although the restaurant wasn't a super-exciting place, the experience was decent.   At least we finally satisfied my Beloved's curiosity.",

    "text": "I really used to like this place.  Dark dive bar that served food late night and was always cool on a hot Phoenix night.  It still is all of that but the food has gone down hill and there are other options in Downtown Phoenix that serve good Irish Pub food and / or are open late night.  Bar - 4 stars.  Great bartenders that pour stiff drinks and are generally on top of things.  The place does get a little crowded and the bar is a little long.  If there is only one bartender behind the bar he or she can miss you if you are on the other end.  5 - star scotch / whiskey selection.  Food - 3 stars.  I used to really like the Rueben and the Chicken Pot Pie.  Unfortunately both have declined.  They don't grill the rye bread in butter anymore I think they just toast it. The Chicken Pot pie crust is not good.  The fish and chips are good and the fish sandwich is good too.  I still come here for the drinks and the cool dive bar air conditioning but the food used to be a lot better.",

You can usually catch some good music here too, which is a total plus when looking for an affordable alternative to the Phoenix live music scene. As an Irish bar, there is a crazy selection of whiskey, but honestly, this place might have the largest selection of spirits I've ever seen. Seriously, the entire length of the bar is deep with selection.",

    "text": "It's about 9PM, and we are tired from being in meetings and cooped up in the hotel for several days. We decided to find a bar to escape from the mundane hotel food. The first bar we found (forgot the name) was a bit yuppy and did not have any seats or tables available (as in, everyone was standing due to lack of furniture). I then yelped really quickly and found this place. Yay, they were still open!   As we were a party of 9, we easily found a table inside the air conditioning. This restaurant wraps around a bit, so be sure you explore all the nooks and crannies if you are looking for a place to sit. About 5 minutes after we sat down, the waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. I will say that service all night was good - appropriate but not overbearing. This place is also capable of splitting a check so that each person could individually pay; there was no surcharge for having a party of 9.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese, and this is why I give three stars. The cheese was baked onto the pasta, but it was not a liquid, creamy gold like at the Pit Room in Houston. The pasta's texture was a bit hard, and the hardened cheese on top reminds me of a newbie mistake, as if you are baking at home for the first time. It was ok, but I did not finish. Thankfully I had others to help me LOL!  I would not object to returning again if in the downtown area. It was nice to escape a bit from the hotel. There's also plenty of misters outside if you want to be on the patio area when it's hot outside!",

All other aspects of the bar seemed authentic, well, maybe down with an Irish accent would help. The food was typical Irish and fare and very good. Many of the typical Irish food favorites were in the menu. The drinks were well prepared and strong. This is a nice.l place to stop in if you want to be transported back to the island or if you haven't been there, a chance to experience the flavor of Ireland.

Ginger beer + Jameson totally hit the spot - followed by their French dip which was superb.  For me, with a French dip, it's all about the bread and the au jus.  I assume you've got the roast beef figured out, and they did.  The bread was nice and fresh, and the au jus was spot on.  Far too many places don't stir their au jus before putting it in the cup, which leads to basically dunking your sandwich in bland broth... but theirs was great.  The ambiance is classy and the service was good, I look forward to a mini staycation at the hotel and will definitely be back.",

The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  On the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but I've had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie. 2 of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. I'm going to go back, just get it on my own.  Lastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club.",

A side order of Irish soda bread came with it. I wasn't too into this (it was crumbly like cornbread but more dense and the flavor was practically non-existent, but maybe that's what soda bread is, I don't know) so I swapped that for some garlic bread which was actually a breadstick with some butter swiped onto one side... didn't work out for me. Like the other reviewers said and I agree, the bathroom (I only saw one M/F share) is questionable. And although the location of the pub is very close to the light rail, I still have to go all the way downtown to get there and I'm incredibly lazy, so I won't be making any special trips.  There are a lot of items on the menu besides the usual Irish things, such as burgers, salads, and sandwiches. Pricing is inexpensive.",

It's not the nicest \"pub\" in town, but it's cozy. The food isn't fabulous, but the wings are pretty good and as far as bar grub goes, it actually isn't bad. The staff is usually quite nice and if you happen in more than once, they seem to remember you, which is a huge plus in my book. But the best part of any visit is the people watching. There is literally a cross-section of the entire Phoenix area crammed in to this one little spot. And I love that there is absolutely not one pretentious bone in the whole place. I spent one night there on my hands and knees helping my friend find his tooth (literally it popped out like 5 times) and no one even gave us a second glance! I guess that alone should rate this place a solid 3.5 stars!!!",

The Irish in me is drawn to these watering holes faster than an Arizona Republican is drawn to a pro-S.B.1070 rally.  I want to like this place more than I do...  Maybe it's the higher prices and lack of any sort of happy hour that provides good deals.  Maybe it's the fact that the rubin I ordered looked like one of those sandwiches mom packed in my lunch box stuffed in a ziplock bag back in 3rd grade - and didn't seem to taste much better...  Or maybe it's just the fact that with all of the other great places there are to eat and drink downtown, Seamus didn't get the memo.

The drinks were typical for a bar and occasionally there was live music. I thought it was a fun place to visit. The decor is typical fun for an Irish pub, love the troll and leprechaun dolls in the showcase.  Now that I visit here more often I am in love with this bar.  Brandon is an amazing bartender.  I love going here in Sunday's to enjoy the most amazingly delicious chicken pot pie in town while enjoying the best playlist provided by Randal.   Go for the drinks, go for the food, and go for the fun. Definitely just go to Seamus.",

    "text": "I looked for boxty all over Ireland. I read about it and I found out in Ireland that is not such a common thing. It's a traditional plate in Ulster but it's hard to find. The pub advertises it as something from Galway or the West of Ireland. Be aware that it's completely inaccurate since you can only potentially find it in the 9 counties (Ulster). I stopped at this pub on the 19th of September and it was for lunch time. The pub looks very much like any pub in Ireland that I visited in Ireland. I has a relaxed atmosphere and people sitting at the counter enjoying beers. While there I saw a man and a woman have a friendly conversation. I really wanted to try the boxty so I chose the corned beef and cabbage boxty. I also ordered an Angry Orchard cider which was the only cider on tap (I really wanted an Irish cider on tap). The food arrived in 10-15 minutes. The boxty was presenting well and it was placed on top of a generous dish of corned beef and cabbage. The boxty, a potato pancake, was tasty. It was finely mashed and the outside tasted somewhat buttery. I like the potato part but not so much the butter flavor (I'm not a fan of large quantities of butter, especially with potatoes). The corned beef was decent but there was plenty of fat. The cabbage was not amazing because it was plain. All in all I like the boxty was good but what came with it was not so exciting. The cider was great an refreshing. Angry Orchard is not Irish but it's darn good and it's definitely one of my favorite ciders. It very much compares to the ciders I had in Ireland and Northern Ireland. I give this pub 4 stars, primarily for the atmosphere, the music and the boxty. In this pub they play great music because I heard all the great stuff from the late 60s and early 70s (classics from Simon & Garfunkel, The Beatles, CSN/CSNY, The Byrds, CCR, Bob Dylan and much more). The menu needs some corrections: boxty is from Ulster and not Galway, one dollar sign is missing under the boxty section. I believe this is a good place to relax and meet other folks. All in all, I am a fan and I liked Seamus McCaffrey's (to be accurate, the name of the pub should be fixed to Seamus which is the proper spelling).",

Both times I have been here (on a Saturday night) there has been NOWHERE to sit and it has taken 5+ minutes for a beer. If I want a pub feel, I will go to George & Dragon.  At the George & Dragon, it is out of the Central Phoenix melee, has ample parking, seating for days, and takes at most a minute for a drink.   If I am going to a McCaffrey establishment, I would MUCH rather go to Rosie's which is bigger and a few miles away.  I seem to have come here a bunch recently for bar-crawls and I will be avoiding this place like the plague.  I'll go to Hannie's or Cityscape instead, thanks.",

    "text": "My friend and I stopped in here for lunch recently and were impressed. I had never been, and he had never been sober so it was a new experience for both of us. McCaffrey's is a great place to grab lunch and a beer. It appears they always have lunch specials during the week so prices were reasonable.  What I like about McCaffrey's is they offer a pretty wide selection of Irish beers. I find it funny that a lot of Irish pubs have Guinness and sometimes Harp, and offer nothing else. McCaffrey's offers Smithwicks, and a few others I can't recall the names of in addition to the basics. They also make great whiskey drinks according to my friend.   I had the turkey bacon melt with fries (lunch special), as did my friend so I didn't have the chance to try any of their Irish fare but what I had was great. I'll definitely be back for dinner someday to try some of their more traditional food.  If you're looking for a good, long lunch with Irish beer or good whiskey, I'd recommend Seamus McCaffrey's. It also looks like it would be a fun place to drink at night, I will be back.",

    "text": "Seamus McCaffrey's is one of the top dive bars in the downtown Phoenix area. There are several reasons why:  It has one of the best, busiest (and cramped on the weekends) patios in Phoenix. It is likely that if you arrive later in the evening it will be difficult to procure a drink or a spot. However, do not give up, with a little practice you too can learn the \"Seamus Slither\". This is a concept of my own invention where you must slither through the crowds to reach a good spot on the patio. Usually the bros are kept out so there's little threat of unpleasantness.   Some people have mentioned that the bathroom is not up to par, well, it's a dive bar so get over it. The bathroom is towards the back and up the stairs, have fun.   Another great thing about Seamus is that it is in the middle of what is starting to become a bar district on Monroe Street. It lays directly across from the alley leading to Valley Bar and if Cornish Pasty ever opens it too is on this street. This bar is also one of the best hubs to pick up a pedi-cab (or regular cab if you're into that) downtown.  The food is average, it's really typical bar food but I love that the kitchen stays open really late (I'm not sure what time they stop but I've stumbled in well-past midnight and was served). The fish and shrimp is my go to.   Drinks are typical downtown prices... I don't know, I never bother to ask how much I'm paying for drinks.   PEDI-CAB!",

    "text": "Always there and (almost) always reliable, Seamus McCaffrey's is still my favorite place to grab a beer downtown.  Last Friday night, I convinced a couple of friends that we ought to go check out the newly burgeoning night life in downtown Phoenix, since they had both moved away in recent years.  So after being thoroughly un-wowed by the Roosevelt row area, we decided to head back to our favorite old standby, Seamus.  My only complaint was an out-of-order men's room, which gets a pass for being in a known old building and for the bouncer explaining our other options politely and immediately.  After all, what's an Irish pub without a pisser?  Thankfully, still a pretty good Irish pub in this case.",

And while this ain't exactly like being in Chicago, it'll more than pass for the middle of the desert.  First the annoying: cash only.  We weren't exactly prepared for this, bubt made do.  It was also a $10 cover and the drafts were all $5.  Again, I can understand that this is their big money maker and I won't hold a grudge over it.  It was still easy to get the drinks, and that's what really matters.  As for the ambiance, its pretty much what I needed.  Everyone was drunk by the time we got there, and they shipped in someone to sing some dirges and drinking songs.  This made Ayesha come to the conclusion that I may be whiter than she originally thought.  I wasn't sure that was possible, but there you have it.  Seamus is an Irish dive bar.  If that's what you're looking for, then more power to you and come on in.  I'd have no qualms about coming back.",

I couldn't have been more pissed off.  The husband and I went to the Turf around 5 to grab something to eat.  After paying a stupid 10 dollar cover charge, which included both places, we though McAffrey's would be a better choice since they block off the street every year for the party.  That did not happen this year.  The pub became more crowded than ever and we couldn't even get in.  What a waste.  I was really disappointed.  Between the Turf and McAffrey's and 40 bucks later, we only got a couple small plates of food.  BOO!",

    "text": "Buried under the wonderful Hotel San Carlos is the perpetually popular Seamus McCaffery Irish Pub. I'm not a big drinker (actually, I don't drink, but I used to) but I love going to bars. There is something about the ambiance of a good Irish bar that doesn't try to be more than that. McCaffery's has a pretty decent menu for a bar. Corned beef and cabbage and fish and chips are expected but uncommon in the downtown area which makes them welcome fare. The beer selection is excellent with tons of imports in bottles and on tap. The burgers aren't great but the tuna sandwich is killer. There is live music on the weekends usually and the crowd is pretty constant most nights.  The service is terrible but it's a bar, I'm not sure what you expected.  If you are looking to drown your sorrows or surround yourself with a blue collar crowd, this is the best place in town to do it. If you are looking to grab a bite to eat, the Silver Spoon next door is a safer bet for variety and service.",

The food is definitely not a love maker, I can only imagine the old cookers and fryers that produce a less than average fish and chips and stale Fries.. UUURGGHH   Only reason they get two stars?

The only reason I like Seamus is because I've always had a good time there and I think my friends played a huge part in that.  They have an extensive menu of Irish food and the service has always been good for me. Some nights, there is live Irish music too. I don't really care for that because that's just one more thing I have to talk over.   There is lots of seating, but don't come here on a First Friday night because it gets packed. Their chairs have taken some abuse over the years so don't be surprised to find a chair with a broken back but when its busy, take what you can get.   Overall- nothing spectacular here.",

(I forgot how pathetic downtown is after 5pm). I remembered Seamus and hoped that it would still be open at this late hour of 8:30 in the evening. Sure enough, it was still serving beer. Yippie! And on top of that, the kitchen was still open. I ordered the Sheppard's Pie and it did not disappoint! In fact it was awesome!   There were still a few patrons in there, a good mix of people, young and old. I think some old ladies complained when I put in some Dropkick Murphys on the juke box. Screw em! The song seemed appropriate.   The staff was uber cool, too! Our bartender, slash owner, was really cool and talkative. The waitress that would come by to place orders would stop and chat, too. Very friendly staff.  There's no doubt that this will be my new downtown spot.",
