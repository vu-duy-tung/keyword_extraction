I left their without eating any meat. Not by choice. I would go back and eat off the regular menu. Plus, I was the only one out of 200 that wasn't Asian. That has to tell you something about the food.",

    "text": "this morning's menu - dim sum & tea time...what a find!  how would i describe my experience?  a simple pleasure...good company, great conversation, and delicious, healthy dishes.  fresh steamed dishes brought to you on carts that tantalize visually and kick start your appetite till you're at capacity.  come hungry, leave satisfied without guilt. my first time there to meet new friends - our party size of 4, was a spontaneous choice, initial thought to grab a coffee, but decided to have dim sum & steaming jasmine tea, an excellent pivot!  we arrived shortly after 10a when dim sum usually starts and left about 1:30p.  selections sampled included pork su mai, shrimp dumplings, chinese broccoli topped with oyster sauce, bean curd pork & shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, baked hot dog roll (dim sum style, not american), shrimp chow fun, and two desserts - baked coconut roll and egg custard pastry for dessert.  all this for under $10 per person!  our waiter was a young man who was very personable, attentive to our needs, the food so amazing, the price very reasonable.  what's cool is you dont have to speak chinese (mandarin or cantonese), just point to the dish you desire!  will return very soon, and often.  bucket list item.  it's 5-stars all the way! top3 reasons why... 1- totally delicious, healthy authentic dishes 2- excellent value 3- atmosphere (reminds me of sf china town dim sum - buzzing conversations, authentic, clean, location, great service eg quick, courteous)",

I got so many compliments on the food on my wedding day, thanks to Park and the whole crew of Phoenix Palace to be there from dust to dawn. I got a pretty good deal on wedding package, and also there are plenty of seafood in the main courses (lobsters/shrimps/scallops). Without Park and his crew, my wedding could have been incompleted. Thank you so much for such a great service and high quality entrees.   Also, I have been a regular customer for their excellent dim-sums. Sauteed clams with jalapenos, chicken feet, steam buns, beef tripe, shrimp balls, gailan and their delicious desserts are recommended. Wow I just can't complain about anything about this place. Try them out you will believe me.",

    "text": "Yes!!! I am coming back here and recommend this to all you dim sum cravers and Asian tourists. The last couple of years when I visited Arizona, all I could find to eat were either  Vietnamese pho or Chinese. Now I can say that I've tried dim sum in Arizona!   Yelped this place out and it was hard to choose from China King or Phoenix Palace but I had to make a quick choice because we wanted to eat and back to California so here we were, at phoenix palace.  Phoenix palace is located in a plaza filled with other Asian stores. It's actually across from LA fitness if you end up being in that plaza instead of the actual plaza (we got lost trying to find this place haha)   Waiting? Ah yes... There was 10 minute wait but hey, better than 40 minute wait like the dim sum's back in Cali. That 10 minute went by quick. We did come here on a Saturday around noon, so the wait was nothing. Let the hostess or host know how many in your party, grab a number then wait for them to call it to be seated.   Service? Hey! These ladies here who pushes carts knows English very well. Will know what kind of dim sum you are looking for if you, yourself know what you want and know what the dim sum contains. Quick with clearing out our empty dishes on the table, which is great!  Food? Liked it a lot. There were four of us and we got...  - fried squid (special order) yums. There's minced fried garlic, sliced jalapeno  and minced green onion. Eat it while it's hot! We all know how fried stuff would taste if we leave it out too long.  - Chinese brocolli with oyster sauce - it was our friend's favorite veggie. Good stuff. Still got it's crunch and not soggy! Awesome  - Seaweed - it's like a seaweed salad with pickle-ish underneath, and thinly sliced ginger hidden inside the seaweed which made it tasted even better.   - sticky fried rice - there's eggs, Chinese diced sausages, minced dried shrimp and minced mushroom. tasted okay, but just needed a dash of soy sauce to taste better.  - sticky rice wrapped with lotus leaf or could be banana leaf - delicious. inside contains slices of shitaki mushrooms, dried shrimps and a chunk of Chinese sausage which made it tastes so good.  - shrimp paste on bell peppers - Light gravy sauce which was good. Have the lady cut it in half so you can share :)  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=n-eQ6GAV2NbnLsKyQGRq3A#yQcMdVZjHBVarx1k46LFWA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqS...</a> What you see up at the ceiling.. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=n-eQ6GAV2NbnLsKyQGRq3A#_sbYguK9eVh2kRyUc7fruw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqS...</a>  Overall, this dim sum place is more than just legit. With the great service they provided, I will be coming back for their dim sum and on the next visit, I will try more of their special dishes! Thumbs up!",

Phoenix Palace is a dim sum place, meaning it is exactly what you might expect - lots of carts pushing around delicious food, huge tables, and an energetic but nice atmosphere. You feel excited and energized being here, which I like. There are lines running out the door here, but service is fast, so the wait is never bad.   The food is superb. Everything I tried - from the bao to the glutinous rice - was tasty and perfectly cooked. The spare ribs were excellently seasoned. I highly recommend the coconut buns, which basically blew my mind.   I highly recommend this place!",

My friends and I went on Saturday for a brunch and we thought it would be overly crowded but it wasn't at all. From what I was told, they recently renovated so maybe not many people know that it's open again? Lucky for us, it was spacious with great service.   Everything we tried was delicious. All the dumplings were good and I don't remember the names of everything. I suggest you go with a large group so that you can try everything! My favorite is the Shumai and lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice. Their chicken feet, beef tendon, and tripe were delicious too. Didn't smell bad at all like some places. Be adventurous and try them :)",

My service dog and I sat at a booth by ourselves while I enjoyed my meal.   The food's fine.

Even better, we were near the kitchen, so we were surprised that they brought out so much of the \"good stuff\" right away! . Not only was this a flawless Dim Sum experience from a service standpoint, but I found several items which I'd never tried before. Every item was so flavorful and perfectly prepared! And, even though  it's summer, I got my Pu-Li tea! This event was as memorable as any Dim Sum I've enjoyed anywhere in the world, including old Hong Kong, where I had Yum Cha for 3-4 meals per day.

We walked in on a weekday afternoon for dim-sum lunch and were quickly seated.  The ladies were quick with stopping by with carts of little stainless-steel containers.  They popped the top off and would say what they were (of course she could've said \"fried donkey ears\" in Chinese and I would'n't have known the difference)... my friend and I tried maybe 4 or 5 little dim-sum plates plus noodles for my friend and the bill was... gasp... 12 dollars total - yeah, SUPER cheap!   I don't know what good or bad dim-sum is, but I know that this was filling, flavorful, priced well and when I googled what I ate later that night, my pics looked the same as those online.  Note that there was definitely a language barrier, but be patient.. they offer good service and you're definitely being served by hard-working staff.  I would return for dim-sum again here.",

It's best to come early, not only to beat the crowds but also to ensure you get to enjoy the full range of dim sum dishes. Sometimes if you come later not all of the carts are still out. There are lots of varieties and its very easy to order. Even for someone not fully familiar with dim sum cuisine eats super easy to ask to see the dish and point. If you need further clarification each server carries a list of the dishes they are carrying in both Cantonese and English.   My favorites are the steamed pork buns, the shrimp and scallop dumplings, and the egg custard buns. Really everything we've had here is pretty tasty. Its nice to be able to order at any pace you want. I often sit for a little bit and then get ready for some more chow and order again.   Prices are affordable- about 20 per person, service pretty good- although I frequently want for water, and food always tasty. Definitely worth trying.",

    "text": "Excellent Chinese food dinner with massive portions. When our usual Pho spot closed for New Year's, we trotted into Phoenix Palace for our first dinner of 2014.  The three of us opted for the Mandarin Dinner (family style): Hot & Sour Soup, Fried Crab Puff, Egg Roll, Pot Sticker, and one entree for $13.95 per person. We tried to substitute for egg drop soup, or anything else, but the language barrier and seemingly restaurant policy kept us from the substitution. Nevertheless, we were not disappointed.  Hot & Sour Soup: Served in a huge bowl, the consistency was more like a stew. Great flavor and not too spicy, though it heats up.  Fried Crab Puff, Egg Roll, Pot Sticker - enough for at least one per person, we had leftovers of crab puffs and pot stickers. Very flavorful with quality ingredients. I could have munched on these for dinner but had to save room!  Sweet & Sour Chicken - large chunks of white meat in a sweet glaze that's sticky enough for a full coating of rice. My favorite of the three we ordered.  Beef and Broccoli - tasted good and overall above average. Again, a large enough serving to feed a group of 3.  Kung Pao Chicken - not as good as the others. I'd go with something else next time. The chicken pieces were smaller than I'd like and it seemed like the flavor was too blended, like you couldn't tell what you were eating except for the spice. It wasn't bad, just not the best.  It's a good sign when all of the staff and patrons speak the language of the cuisine. Phoenix Palace is quite authentic and has a great assortment of dishes. I will return to try others, especially their dim sum.",

Their plates are very large compared to C-Fu as well. Price wise wasn't bad, I believe we got about 8 plates for 2 people and it ended up being 30 dollars. Not bad. The environment is nice too.

Same eggy after taste for the porridge too. Not returning for these reasons.",

Tucked into the most Asian intersection in Phoenix, Phoenix Palace is a gigantic open space of a dining room and looks like a very authentic place. There are always tables of Chinese men drinking coffee and catching up on weekend nights. On Friday and Saturday nights, you'll be able to catch Chinese karaoke night from about 10PM on.   They serve fantastic food. Nothing here (at least on the menu they give us whiteys) is really out of the norm from your normal Chinese place. They have a couple of dishes I'm not accustom to, but mostly is the familiar Kung Pao, Beef & Broccoli, Hot and Sour Soup, etc.  The food here was delicious, service was perfect, and the atmosphere was truly one of a kind for Phoenix. If you'd have asked me a month ago where you could go for Chinese karaoke, I'd have said San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City. Well, now I know, and my life is complete.   I wouldn't hesitate to go back here for more meals. The food is incredbly tasty and fresh.",

What was surprising is that the first two carts driving one behind the other were packed with identical dishes.  It would have made sense if they travelled in different directions at least!  The basic food items like shumai, shrimp dumplings, pork ribs in black bean sauce were decent.  We also ordered a plate of chow fun which was good.  Decent dim sum, perhaps slightly more efficient than c-fu gourmet across the intersection.",

    "text": "First things first ... contrary to its name, this place is not a Buffet, at least in the traditional sense. Also - Dim Sum Hours are limited, so check their website.  Three of us went to Phoenix Palace to celebrate a friend's birthday and enjoy a nice Dim Sum brunch. We were promptly greeted and seated at a nice table in the aisle (which is by the way prime seating - the carts were whizzing by offering all kinds of delectable things). I was happy to find that the vast majority of customers (90% or more) were Asian and heard quite a bit of Cantonese and Mandarin being spoken, so I know this place must be close to authentic to garner this kind of \"street cred\" among the Asian crowd. By noon, the place was almost chock full. So point of advice, get there by 11 AM to get a good table and avoid a wait.   The Dim Sum on offer was overall very good, very tasty. The skin items (dumplings) were very good, and the pork buns were also very good (though a little bit more pork might have been a bit better). Overall the portion sizes were decent (three of most things, four of other things), and I could conceivably see one filling up here for under $10 easily, but we had a birthday to celebrate after all. The only thing that was under par was the rice noodle shrimp, which is basically a giant rice noodle wrapped around shrimp then steamed, it was just a tad over steamed. I had a nice rice congee with Chao Quay (fried bread), which reminded me of Indonesia (we called it Chakwe there - almost the same thing) ... oh the memories... but I digress.   Service was prompt, efficient, and the quality was good. Staff were responsive to our questions about what things were and what they had. Also I didn't see the congee cart and asked the waitress if they had congee, she said yes and asked me what kind I wanted, and she ran over to the cart and got me my congee. Excellent service. The price was very good ... we had a total of 14 dishes between the three of us, plus tea service for me, and iced tea for one, and water for the other. The total bill was about $40 for three people, which I have to say is less than the tab for the three of us at other brunch locales downtown (though to be fair, it was quite a lot of food).   Overall, a great place for the Dim Sum neophyte. Though perhaps not the caliber of places in San Francisco or even the mecca of Dim Sum (Hong Kong), this is certainly one of the better places in the valley for Dim Sum.   Positives:  A good example of traditional Dim Sum (if not a perfect one),                  Good food, great place for groups. Good service. The place                   is also VERY clean.   Negatives:  For me this is a positive, but a due warning to Westerners with ideas of being \"culturally superior\" or otherwise demanding tourists:  Goinghere is akin to a mini trip to Hong Kong or even China. Be aware that eating Dim Sum is not just a different culinary experience, but also is about participating in a different culture and pace of life. Have an open mind, and above all BE PATIENT. So if you don't see the carts (or the cart you want) coming by for a few of minutes, chill out, enjoy your tea or other beverage, and relax. If you can't handle this, go to a Chinese Buffet.   Oh yes, and before I forget, GRADES:  Overall:   A- (no other demerits taken other than mentioned below)  Service:  A-  (The only major demerit on service was that the English                         spoken by some of the cart pushers was not intelligible                        however this is excusable as this is a Chinese place -                         the \"specials\" board was completely in Chinese)  Food:   A-  (A good example of traditional Dim Sum. Some demerits                     include over steamed Shrimp rice noodle [some firmness                    is better], the Har Gao (shrimp dumplings) were good,                     but on the verge of being over-steamed)  Drinks:  No Grade (we did not consume any alcoholic beverages, so no grade is given in this category - though I have to say my Oolong tea was delicious).",

I have been traveling for the past few months and have not had the opportunity to enjoy good dim sum since I left Portland, but with some solid reviews we headed out into the sun to see what Phoenix Buffet had to offer.  Let me start by saying that chicken feet and turnip cake are the barometer by which I generally gauge dim sum quality, and the presence of carts during a weekday lunch was a promising sign. With chop sticks in hand, we ordered a bevy of dishes and set upon them. The chicken feet were excellent! Turnip cake had good flavor, though I usually expect more of a crust. Everything else we tried was equally flavorful, authentic and fresh.   I highly recommend this location if you should happen to find yourself in a similar din sum craving predicament.  Cheers ya'll!",

The name is deceiving as it's not a buffet, they wheel around carts with tons of food variants on them and you choose what you want off the cart - they write on your ticket... you eat... good deal.  So I don't know half of the stuff I ate but it was all good with the exception of some pork balls I had a slight issue with the texture... I'm a white guy from the midwest, never had this stuff before, give me a break lol.  I do, however remember the Snow Mountain Rolls I believe they were called?  Sugary pastry with a very good creme filling... kind of like a creme-filled doughnut but not :/  Super good tho.  Dumplings... they were awesome, and also a safe bet if you don't know what to get.  I'd go back but only with foodie friends that help me decide what to eat :)  Also... a table of 5 ate for like 50 bucks... that surprised me greatly with the amount of food we had on the table... to the point there wasn't any room left!",

That said a 3 star rating from me should be viewed as impressive as I'll always be a tough customer when it comes to Chinese food.  Beef lo mein was my dish of choice.  The noodles were good and it was served with ample cuts of beef.  I was impressed that the noodles weren't as veggie heavy as I've had at other places.  Typically it does not take very long before I'm picking over vegetation in search of noodles and/or meat.  My friend ordered squid with ginger and he was very impressed.  He lived with a Chinese woman for 2 years so he knows a thing or two about Chinese food.  He liked Phoenix Palace a lot.  The complimentary tea was good and a nice touch to the meal.   Oddly enough this is the only Chinese restaurant I have visited and not received a fortune cookie at the end of the meal.",

    "text": "This review is just for the dim sum.  Frustratingly mixed experiences here, and when I consulted one of my True-blue Yelp buddies about this place, she said the same thing.  The first time that we came here, it was a Sunday around 1:30 - they were still doing a steady service of dim sum, but since they stop the carts around 3pm, the crowds had waned quite a bit.  We waited about 5 minutes for a table and were seated in the way back, which we didn't mind since it gave us space to chat and chill out.  We have a couple dim sum places back in my hometown of DC that I am out and out in love with, so I usually know exactly what I want when I go and judge most places by those standards.  Phoenix Palace made me pretty happy on that visit, serving just about all of the dishes that I crave - my husband and I plied our faces with as many dumplings from the steam cart as we could muster, roast pork with gorgeous crackling skin, the fried shrimp and chive dumplings that I seem to crave on a weekly basis, garlicky chinese broccoli and pliantly chewy baked pork buns, along with several other happy bites.  Although some of the dishes were lukewarm by the time they got to our table, we were still happy and chalked it up to coming to eat on the later side.  I'm sure that if we spoke Chinese, we may have been able to order the few things that we didn't see on the carts but had spied on their dim sum menu, but it wasn't a terribly big deal.  We definitely planned on returning.  Cue this weekend and I am jonesing for shu mai and har gow hardcore.  We make a trip to Phoenix Palace around noon on a Saturday and there is a crowd waiting in the front area.  No worries - the line at dim sum places usually moves quickly.  We see a mass of people waiting at the check in desk to get a number and the time seems to just tick by with no one coming to check anyone in.  Countless employees see no less than 20 of us waiting patiently and just walk away.  Finally, after 10 minutes of standing there, a Chinese couple flags down what seems to be a manager and he hollers at one of the girls to help out.  She briefly surveys the crowd and then walks off.  One of the few couples that already had a number and were waiting walks over to the take out desk to ask someone there for an estimate on when they'll be seated and are met with no response.  I gaze over at the folks pushing the carts around and they look haggard and a little depressed.  Although I really wanted to stay, I felt as though the universe was compelling me with all these signs of bad service to go eat elsewhere.  We bailed, but were bummed to do so.  I have mixed feelings as to whether we'll be back or not, given that we've had much worse service issues at many other places here in the Valley for a lot worse dim sum.",

It usually starts between 11:00-11:30am and it'll be that way for like an hour or so. Sometimes waits on 20-30minutes or longer. People are willing to wait because the food is good. The most optimal time to go would be before 11am or after 12:30 maybe 1pm. Overall, if you want good authentic Chinese food, I would recommend giving this place a try.",

One of the owners, Sam, takes great pride in his work and the reputation of his establishment. It's very roomy I side but note that on the weekends and holidays this place is PACKED. The duck here is to die for....I love it so much they usually have a plate ready for me when I come in with my bestie who introduced me to this place. The dumplings all have different names that I haven't learned yet, but the staff is super friendly and speak English and Cantonese so they are able to help. I've come here with friends, on date night with my hubby, with my little one in small parties and large and have always had a good experience. Note that there is a lot on the menu. Sometimes the specials are in Cantonese or Mandarin, but they can give you a description of you're curious. Aside from dim sum you can also come here for sit down dinners and they are delish as well. The salt and pepper crab is worth every penny. A full crab slightly breaded and cooked with fried garlic...we had at least 4 curious tables near us and one finally gave in and asked what we were having. Note also that this is more of a traditional Chinese restaurant with a sprinkle of Chinese- American dishes. It costs a lil more but is worth it!",

Finally got seated and very efficiently all these carts started coming towards us so we started picking out over 6 different items and ordered half of roast duck. After all the food arrived we started to dig in. Right away we flagged down a server to have several items heated. Duck and stuff eggplant was very cold also the noodles. After waiting so long to be seated we waited longer for service and the food was not good at all! I am very disappointed with the lack of quality of the food and the service. our bill was over 80.00 which is normal for for us and we will try this place again!",

    "text": "Was wanting to try the DIM SUM here.  I picked Mother's Day to do it so the large crowd of people waiting to get in should not have surprised me.  They were mostly asian families so that gave me a clue that I was in a good place.  Expected a 30 minute wait and it was about 40.  Yet, I was surprised that it was not an hour considering all those people waiting outside their doors.   I was surprised  that they have white tablecloths too.  It's kind of a big place and it's got to be an expense but they do it despite the fact that they are not a high end restaurant. I liked that.  Now to the food.  We ordered from the Dim sum as well as the regular menus.    DIM SUM:   Chinese broccoli:  A large portion of fresh, sauteed, al dente & delicious broccoli. Better than the broccoli sold in the  regular supermarket.  The stalks reminded me of Asparaus stalks.   5 stars  Fried Tofu:    4 large, greaseless chunks with a side sweet sauce   5 stars Chicken Feet:  (Yeah baby, chicken feet) 6 tender,  gelatinous, yummy feet in a great sauce  5 stars Shanghai Dumplings:  4 smallish pork-filled, broth-filled dumplings.  5 stars.  Off the regular menu, hubby ordered sauteed chicken in an orange sauce and requested that the chicken not be breaded. The large portion of chicken was amazingly tender with a really delicious sauce.  5 stars.   Did I tell you they give you free hot tea?  Yes they do and the tea is the real deal made with loose tea leaves.  Nice touch. Service was really amazing considering the crowds at this place today.  The young man was extremely patient with us explaining the DIM SUM options and orchestrating hubby's breadcrumb-free chicken.   The only negative was the checkout. You have to bring the check to the cashier in the front and there was quite a line to pay your bill.  I am not penalizing them for this as it was my idea to come on a major holiday.  Duh..... This was my first time here but it won't be my last! (check out all 5 photos!)",

We accepted damned near everything that they offered us, and everything was really, *REALLY* good. Gotta say, I'm not a fan of chicken's feet (they're just sorta cartilagenous), but this is definitely a good place to come and figure out whether or not that's your particular jam. Everything else was quickly devoured, and at some point we'll be back. My only gripe is that there could have been a bit more variety and a few more options- other dim sum places that I've been to seemed to have a larger selection, but I don't feel that it would be fair to knock too many points for that since what they had was so good.",

    "text": "I've eaten dim sum in a lot of places. From fancy pants restaurants to hole in the walls. Even frozen dim sum from your freezer. Never once did I question wtf was I eating I came here. Seriously this may pass off as dim sum to those who eating it for the first time. Now given the positive, they had a couple dishes that were good. Hence the two stars instead of one. But simple common fare such as har gow or siu Mai was butchered. Siu Mai tasted like beef balls you get in Vietnamese pho and the texture of the har gow wasn't better than something you get in the frozen section. All the food came out like warm and not steaming hot like it was fresh of the steamer. Don't waste your time here if you love dim sum.",

There were Christmas trees, silk flowers galore, 16 different light fixtures, 20 different flooring's, hanging stuffed animals, and all sorts of craftiness that should have never been put on the shelves to sell, little lone ever sold.  It was filled with Asians and that's all I needed to see, to know that I had landed in Nirvana, this was my 3rd time there and I will keep going back.",

The place is huge, family style everything, a bit on the dirty side depending on where they seat you. It is warm but because the carts carry piping hot mini dishes. The staff hardly speak English, waitstaff can be slow but the dimsum is typically always on top of each stop. If you can get over the crazy lines out the door and wait time, the food is worth the wait. Expect a long wait on weekend lunch times though.",

Mind you this feedback has come primarily from Asians that have had their fair share of authentic dining all over the world, so they're quite seasoned. But coming from a white girl that is new to the world of dim sum, I'd have to agree.  I'm pretty sure that by now I've had a taste of most everything on the menu, and while nothing stands out as being outrageously delicious, nothing is particularly bad either. Some of the dishes I tend to prefer over others includes chinese broccoli, bao (pork rolls) and pineapple fried rice. Everything else is just so-so.  I do like the prices (around $2-3 a dish) and it makes for an enjoyable out-of the-ordinary-brunch outing for larger groups, but it does seem as though you get easily overlooked by the dim sum cart when you're at a small table, so I would seek alternative dining options if that's the case.",

    "text": "My boyfriend was looking for a place for this parents to eat at and we were originally going to this other Chinese restaurant but took a wrong turn and ended up in this plaza so we just decided to eat here instead.  It was about 5pm - pretty early for dinner for Asian people at least - cause besides us, there was only one other diner in the place. It was so empty they even decided to turn off some of the lights in the restaurant. I didn't really expect that many people honestly - this is Arizona, and it is 5 PM.    We sat down and ordered three dishes:   Chestnut and Chicken Pot - super flavorful dish! - chicken was tender and went very well with the chestnuts   Crispy Noodles with Seafood Gravy - I really would have liked it more if they didn't drench it with the gravy because I do like the crispy part of the noodles but since they poured a lot of sauce onto it - all the noodles got soaked.   Chinese Veggie (Choi Sum with garlic) - tender and garlicky.   The food was surprisingly very tasty. I expected not very good Chinese food here but to my amazement, the food was pretty decent - however it did cost way more than Chinese restaurant in say like San Gabriel or Monterey Park area (for those of you from LA would know what I'm talking about) here it's like about double the price - but i think it's because they don't get half as busy as in other places that are populated with Asian people.   The waiters and waitresses looked pretty bored most of the time - but things started to pick up around 6ish when we were about to leave. Reviews say that this place is good for dim sum - I wish I could try it but since my bf graduated today I don't think I'll be coming back to Arizona any time soon.   Overall however I think this is a pretty good place for dinner - the prices a little higher but like I said there aren't too many other Chinese restaurants like this around.",

The chinese broccoli was good, but I did feel like I needed to dab it on my napkin.  3. after the initial rush of 5 or so dishes, the carts didn't come around much anymore.

I've dealt with many horrible customer service restaurants from the Asian community but this place has got to be the worst. The hostess does not care that you have to wait and only want to know if want the number or not. Servers who aren't your server do not care about you since you're not tipping them and will walk in front of you or push you out of the way to get what they need. The ladies who push the carts just want to give you food(it's not a bad thing) but they will get a little pissed off when you say no to everything on their cart, they will make sure you know they're giving you looks. However, the food is great and this place has an amazing selection of different dishes. Truly great for dim sum. I do hope they get the soup dumplings soon though because that's the only thing they are missing from their menu.",

I've gone here twice, both on Sundays at 11am and 1pm, and both times I was seated immediately despite the fact that there was a LOT of people. I'm shocked that even at peak times there's no wait. (Maybe it's because we live in Arizona and not California anymore so there's a smaller Asian population? lol I have no idea, but I'm not complaining.)  I overheard a lady tell the host that she didn't want a table far away from the entrance because her mom was very frail and could not walk far into the restaurant. They had to wait a few minutes longer for a table but it was no problem to accommodate them. I thought that was very nice.  If you want to quickly order to-go desserts, you line up at the bakery at the side of the entrance! There's even free samples.  Now, onto the good stuff.. the dim sum experience! The second time I was seated, they brought me to the corner of an extra room they had wayyy in the back. The pessimist in me was concerned that I would miss out on all the dim sum carts, or that they would rarely visit our table. FEAR NOT - despite being in a small corner, in another room from the main dining hall, the cute pushcart ladies came VERY frequently. In fact, after ten minutes my table was already full of dim sum and we ended up overordering! Not to fret though because I love eating dim sum leftovers.  The excellent: xiao long bao (dumplings with soup inside, make sure you eat it quick while the soup is hot), the siu mai, cha siu bao, the chicken pot pie (lol no idea why this is a dim sum option, but it's really good and I found it in the same cart as the dessert cart), THE EGG TARTS.  The ok: curry bun, coconut macaroon, fried crispy taro (forgot the name but typically this is my favorite dim sum dish, but it was just OK here), radish cake, chicken feet. (My boyfriend loves chicken feet and he liked the ones here, I'm just not super into chicken feet in general.)  Honestly there wasn't anything I hated or disliked. Great variety of dim sum, fast service, and my tummy was happy.  OH - and THEIR EGG TART IS AMAZING. Get the one that looks more yolky and yellow. The egg tart that looks more cooked is still good, but if you get the yellower egg tart, IT'S SOOOO BOMB. Especially when they're newly made so they're still hot. Homg. Freaking amazing.  My bill ended up being $45 for two people, which is higher than usual, but keep in mind I was getting wayyyy too excited trying out all the dim sum. We ended up with LOTS of leftovers. Normally, two people at dim sum will come out with a check totaling around $30-$32.  Yes, I'm definitely returning and loading up on those egg tarts.",

The ladies wheeling around supersized servings of fried, steamed, sauteed, boiled, you name it, they have it dim sum delights. The place hums like a HK Chinese dim sum place, but the ladies are so nice and friendly. I was thrilled to practice my Cantonese with them. They also offer a variety of teas and happily accommodated my request for \"kook poh,\" a combination of chrysanthemum tea and bo lei tea. It is a lovely bittersweet mixture.  They have all the dim sum favorites: har kao, siu mai dumplings. Their char siu paos are to die for. The dough is steamed flawlessly fluffy and the filling, both sweet and savory. I enjoyed their chives dumpling very much. The skin was thin, panfried. The filling was texturific with the chives just cooked. The pei dan chok or Century egg porridge was pure comfort food. I liked their kai lan with oyster sauce. It was not overly sauced and veggies were still green and not overcooked. Their lo pak gou or white radish cake was nicely steamed and fried. I loved it. I could've eaten the whole plate. There were a few other dumpling dishes that I ate.  A huge shout out to Yelper, Karen W. for pulling a bunch of Yelpers plus foodies together to share this meal. It was both delectable and enjoyable. I have now found my dim sum haven in Greater Phoenix. The huge meal came up to $13 per head including tip. I came back that afternoon to pick up food to take home. My children devoured the char siu pao and siu long pao in less than 15 minutes.",

Everyone knows that you will be waiting at least 20 minutes to get a table and that alone should tell you that it's pretty good. It is certainly worth the wait. I mean, who doesn't love carts with Chinese food circling around you? If you are in a prime spot towards the middle of the restaurant, then you are golden. I wish I could say that I knew how much each plate was approximately, but I honestly don't know. We have always split with the group and we do not understand the card where they check each time you grab a plate. However, we always found the food and experience to be worth it. Our favorite dishes are definitely the chow main noodles (always need more than one plate of it), Chinese broccolli with oyster sauce, shumai, shrimp balls, humbao (sp?), fried tofu, sweet tofu with syrup dessert, almond milk puff, and coconut bread. So authentic and really yummy. Endure the line to try!",

The pastires they had a huge selection but the inside custard was very hard inside.

The snow pea leaves in garlic sauce tastes boiled rather than stir fried over high heat. The eggplant almost tasted like a sweet and sour dish-it was gross. The steamed tilapia was the best dish, fresh with scallions and ginger soy.  Overall, prices are higher than the quality of the food. They are fast and efficient at getting food on the table and getting leftovers packed quickly, but the overall dining experience is nothing to write home about.",

I was one of them, so I had no expectations going in, except seeing carts on carts of food around. This is definitely what we got at Phoenix Palace!  One of our friends set up a reservation so our group  wouldn't have to wait, most recommended since it gets busy super early. We had the perfect table that fit everyone comfortably, right smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. The cart ladies are a-plenty!   Literally the cart ladies started surrounding our table once a majority arrived. Kind of overwhelming to have all of them descend on us like that and none of us know what to order except for our main organizer who made all of the ordering decisions. Whatever he picked for us though was amazing! Dumplings, rolls, noodles, meats, EVERYTHING was delicious. I wouldn't be able to tell you what I ate, but it was crazy good. And then someone thought up the idea to get a plate of chicken feet for anyone to try. Dont think I will eat that again, ever.   The cart ladies were most excellent at going around the restaurant and asking if we wanted more. The desserts are generally sweet rolls and I forced myself to only eat one (curse you carbolicious bread!).   In total we ate for $14/person with tip and it was worth every penny. We all brought cash so the check could be split evenly. Cannot wait to come back and experience dim sum again!",

    "text": "Overall, 3.5 stars Food: 4/5 Service: 3/5 Cleanliness: 3/5 Price: 4/5  I have been to Phoenix Palace at least 10 times, and I have a pretty consistent experience each time. This is one of the only options for dim sum in Phoenix, so I would recommend this place for dim sum in Phoenix.  Food: This place is like a traditional dim sum restaurant with carts being pushed and you order off of the items that are on the cart. I usually order in Mandarin, and this works for me, but I know they can also speak English, but this might be a bit more difficult. Some of my favorites are the shao mai, the dou hua, and chicken feet. They have a huge selection of food that you can get, so I suggest you go with more people, so you can try out more food.  Service: Especially during the weekend, the service can be patchy. Usually, carts show up as you are trying to sit down, even if I'm still waiting for people to show up. So I do feel al little rushed at times. Also, the restaurant is a bit crowded, so when there are carts being pushed around all the time, it does get a bit claustrophobic. And I have had issues where the carts didn't have what I wanted, so sometimes you have to ask someone who isn't pushing a cart to get an item for you. Dim sum is about immediately available food, this kind of ruins the flow of the meal.  Cleanliness: Not the cleanest, on par with most Chinese restaurants.  Price: Usually a great price! Get enough to be full, and price comes out to about $10 per person in my experience. Different items/carts are worth different prices, so if you're concerned, just ask.",

Tofu fan is  sweet soft tofu dessert. I highly recommend it from here. Their tofu fan syrup has a subtle yet shockingly fresh ginger taste.

Being from Northern California originally I have been to a few places, but it was my husband's very first time. The staff was very friendly and the food was great! My husband, a picky eater, especially loved the sesame buns with red bean filling and the buns with egg custard. There are 2 reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars. I was especially looking forward to Xiao Long Bao, better known as soup dumplings. I read that they served them here, but when the carts were circling they were nowhere to be found. They are my absolute favorite dim sum so that was a bit disappointing. The other reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that we felt a bit overwhelmed. As soon as we were seated every single cart came up to our table and waited in line to pitch us their dishes. They would ask repeatedly if we wanted the same dishes after we said no before they walked away. It would have been a bit nicer of an experience if they were circulating more a gave us a chance to breathe a bit. All and all though we had a wonderful experience. Delicious food, and the price is great! We could have easily fed 4 with the amount of food we got (we wanted to try a bit of everything) and ended up with lots of leftovers to box up and take home. Friendly people, yummy food, fun experience! We will definitely be back, and hopefully next time I will get my soup dumplings!",

When the final bill came I noticed 4 GUEST $2.63 charged onto my bill. I asked what this was for since we didn't order any hot tea. The cashier said that it's a SERVICE FEE we all have to pay for this she said. I said for what? The FEE goes towards SAUCES you use on the table, Cleaning table clothes-we have to pay to have them washed she said and towards cleaning of the kitchen as well as amongst other things. I told her that it was bull crap. That's wrong. I told her I'm from the East Coast and no where do they do this in NY, Boston, Chicago or San Francisco Chinatown. Then she said the sign is here listed that we can add the fee to your bill. That sign was posted at the register after you have already paid. That's ENTRAPMENT!!! I will never go back. By the way my baby who was 18 months old had  to pay that service fee. He didn't even eat or drink anything from that place.",

Since there was no soy sauce on it yet, I noticed that her scissors left all these black specks in the rice rolls.  I told her the scissors were dirty but she continued to try and pick the specks off WITH her scissors!  It only made it worse.  I told her I don't want that plate anymore and she said no, I can't return it.  I was about to ask for the manager until she finally took it back and off my bill.  She put that plate back on the cart, now with soy sauce.  Onto the next customer?!",

I came with 6 people total and we ate our hearts out. The price came out to be no more than $11 including tip per person.   Only tidbit is I enjoy flavored food, and the food here is a little more bland than I prefer. Request some yellow mustard and chili spices to dip your dishes in and flavor up your food!",

    "text": "Yippee!! I finally found a nice dim sum place near where I live. I am impress at the way their service is managed. The staffs are always on the look out to clear your empty dishes or any service that they can provide. The carts moves around the restaurant continuously and you definitely don't see their staffs standing around and talking. We were presented with our choices of dim sum almost as soon as we sat down on our booth. Their tables were arranged in a very spacious manner, unlike most dim sum restaurants where you always have to move your chair when the cart comes around.   All the dishes we tried were excellent - har kaw, siu mai, Shanghai dumpling, chao mi fen. They are definitely generous with their filling because every piece is very juicy and delicious rather than flour-like. The cook will occasionally comes around with a dish or two that was freshly prepared. Their yam cake is served straight from their portable grill on a cart. My favorite dish that morning is their egg tart. It is THE BEST egg tart I have ever had. The crust is crispy and flaky and the egg custard has a smooth consistency and just the right amount of sweetness.  Their pricing is also very reasonable at $2-$3 per dish. I wish there were more of us so that I could try more things. I will definitely visit again to try different things.",

    "text": "We eat here at least twice a month.  There are two things that set this place apart from most other dim sum restaurants in America, never mind just in Phoenix.  1. A chef who loves to bake.  The head chef, Sam, is constantly baking up really delicious specials.  These are typically sweets/desserts and they are awesome.  He will come out to the tables on a busy weekend with a hot baking sheet full of pastries.  If he offers, by all means, take some!  2. Extremely accommodating service.  We take all of of friends there and that includes some very picky eaters, as well as kids.  I've never seen any restaurant go to such lengths to make sure everybody is happy, including making all kinds of off-menu items to satisfy the pickiest eaters.  Bottom line, it rocks!",

XO sauce spicy fried rice... NOT spicy at all. Very bland. Probably won't get that again.  Assorted veggies plate with rice... it was okay. Wasn't the best I ever had but not bad either.  Service was kind of slow, as it took a while to get seated when there was nobody else in the restaurant, and longer than I would like for them to take my order.  You have to ask for ice waters if you want it otherwise they won't give it to you. You only get tea :p  They pour your tea for you and serve your soup for you which is kind of nice.  But the food... nothing too special to drive a long way for.  Overall, I don't think I will go again, but I guess its a good place to get to go stuff if you're into that.  I also noticed they do dim sum till 3 PM.",

There are carts being wheeled nonstop between the tables. It makes for a fun outing with family and friends. If you're adventurous, you may want to try authentic dishes like chicken feet. If not, there are plenty of dumpling and noodle options, and sweets too. It's not as robust as dim sum in San Francisco Chinatown but it fully satisfies my craving for dim sum. Just don't show up after 2pm because you'll only have 'leftovers' to choose from - they stop adding to the carts once the crowd dies off.",

    "text": "I love that this location serves dim sum via cart every single day, not just on the weekend. And they offer the full assortment, not some skimpy version of the weekend menu.   On this particular visit, I was passing through Phoenix on my way home. Nothing like having a mean craving for dim sum in the middle of the week.   I arrived before the doors even opened. Once in, I was swiftly seated and provided water. Within minutes, the first cart came around. I figured I would be the only person there for hours. But, no, not so. Groups started pouring in about 20 minutes later. By the time I left, there were numerous tables seated with larger groups.   Now, we all know that it is impossible to eat dim sum solo. Like, ridiculous impossible! But I wanted my dim sum now! So, solo I went. This meant, of course, that I didn't get a chance to order as much as I would have preferred.   I found that everything was absolutely fresh, and the portion sizes were a tad bit larger than I was accustomed. Nice but, again, I was trying to go for as many things as possible. In the end, I had five orders and wasn't able to finish off every bite of food. And there was a slight miscommunication over a special order, which was somewhat disappointing, but turned out to be OK. Thank goodness I am open to trying out different types of things.   My recommendation -- go! You may have to wait a long, long time on the weekend for a table. But it will be well worth the wait. Just be sure to take a sizable group along with you so that you are able to try as many items as possible.",

Each dish had its own proper flavor meaning not all the dishes tasted the same which some places do.

It's about as good as most other places I've been, but the selection wasn't very diverse. Maybe we went too early and not everything was out yet. It seems like that's the catch 22: either you arrive early to beat the crowd but have to wait for the good food, or you come later when the food is all ready but you have to wait forever to get seated. Actually, I'm not sure if we were too early for the good stuff or if they good stuff just never came our way; the hostess had seated our group all the way in the back, away from everyone else when the restaurant wasn't even close to being full yet. Seemed like a rather racist decision on their part because my group was predominantly non-East Asians.   Now that I think about it, the service was definitely bad enough to warrant a two-star rating. The ladies pushing the carts were really terse with me. I was ordering everything in Mandarin (because that's the only Chinese I speak) but since people in my group had dietary restrictions, I had to ask about the filling for the different types of dumplings and bao that went by. The ladies got really annoyed about me asking and were pretty rude. They also seemed angry when I asked for four boxes (one for each person) and rejected the two big boxes they initially handed me (even though I had asked for four small boxes to begin with).   Food-wise, it was okay. I've had better had other dim sum places, but my favourite dim sum restaurant in the valley closed, so this is kind of all I'm stuck with. Still, I feel bad for having brought my friends here to try it out. All the good stuff I heard about this place just aren't at all True. Disappointing, to say the least.",

Ordered some shrimp egg rolls, har gao, shu mai, chow mein and Baked BBQ pork buns. The egg rolls were really oily, the har gao had an odd flavor to the shrimp, and the shu mai didn't taste meaty (more fatty). The Baked BBQ pork buns were good though. The worst dish I had was the chow mein. It was severely overlooked and had no \"dragon breath\" flavor to it. If it were only the dishes I might have just given them an update of 2 stars but their customer service was horrendous.   Before we were seated my wife asked about an open table (4 seats) and why it was given to a party of 2 (we were a party of 3) that came after we did. All the person at the door directing people to tables said was WAIT A MINUTE in a very unapologetic and rude tone. When we were finally seated we waited a very long time before we even got our water. Many of the waiters and waitresses which we asked for water/tea either ignored us or just looked at us in disbelief.   Would highly recommend you look elsewhere for dim sum, unless you want poor dim sum quality and rude service. Looks like our time away has just given Phoenix Palace he opportunity to get much worse.",

One lady came to our table in the beginning to offer steamed dishes and at the end I had to walk over to ask for the buns. I didn't get offered porridge or any soups... :(   Food and service were ok- maybe they had an off day?",

There was two other dishes I tried. I don't remember the names of them but one of them has a clear coating around it, made me think of squid, which I actually like squid but this was mushy and tasteless.

    "text": "This is my new favorite place for Dim Sum in the valley.  We have dim sum at least once a month and have tried Great Wall, Golden Buddha, China King and C-Fu gourmet.  I believe that Phoenix Palace is the best of the bunch.  Here is why: 1.  Food quality:  Every dish was prepared perfectly.  Most were slightly above the other restaurants in term of taste.  There were exceptions (we like the shrimp stuffed eggplant best at C-Fu, and the chow mein better at Golden Buddha), but in general, this place was better. 2.  Cleanliness:  Not that other places are not clean, but this place was spotless 3.  Price:  We order almost the same thing at most dim sum restaurants as we have our favorite dishes.  We ordered more than usual here this morning to try some things (10 dishes total) and our bill was $25.78.  We usually average $33-$35 at the other places, and we brought quite a bit home 4.  Selection:  I have seen that the selection has decreased at the other places as their clientele diminishes.  For instance at Golden Buddha, one of the original dim sum places in the valley, you would wait at least 30 minutes if you did not get there before 11am.  Now it seems that the place is barely full, regardless of when you arrive.  As a result, the selection seems to have gone down.  At Phoenix Palace, we simply could not order everything.  When we left, there were still many things that we had still not tried.  We also had a few things that we had never had before (very surprising since we have dim sum so often) 5.  Location:  I live in the Ahwatukee area, so this is slightly closer than Golden Buddha, and far closer than Great Wall.",

I had my office on Market St. and I had a Yank Sing in the alley right behind my building...I could go for dim sum at lunch, let the dishes pile up and waddle back to my office for nice long afternoon nap:) If I felt more ambitious, I could walk up to Chinatown to Delicious, New Fortune and Yong Kee for some of the most remarkable food this side of Hong Kong! It was especially pleasant when we got 4-5 of us to go, and just sit and talk and eat for couple of hours...the art of dim sum:) With that in mind, I headed out for the near reaches of Chandler this past Saturday. Jim and Audrey W. organized a dim sum outing at the Phoenix Palace Buffet (I frankly didn't notice the buffet...I'm sure it was there and very good...I was just too busy pointing at bamboo steamers and bowls and plates and saying \"give me that one please\":) Jim organized the outing after fellow Yelper Helen Y had noted that this place had changed ownership, chefs, etc., and is now quite good! (I now have 2 things to be grateful to Helen Y. for...helping us find good dim sum in greater Phoenix and allowing me to become a citizen of the Republic of Sweet:) We were joined on our outing by Kevin H (in an interesting side note, Kevin got ROTD for...Phoenix Palace Buffet on the exact same day that we went for dim sum!!! What are the odds!?:), Marian H. and Dottsy Z.  The Beautiful Carin wasn't able to make it...she had a little stomach bug and stayed in bed:(  I was going to stay home and take care of her, but the lure of potentially good dim sum was too great!:) Off I went with cheery wave and a lilting \"feel better\" hanging in the air as the door slammed before she changed her mind and asked me to stay around and nurse her back to health:) She's a strong girl...I knew she would pull through:) Boy, am I glad I went! The company and conversation were wonderful...everyone cheered me up about having to leave my better half at home (and as anyone who knows us will attest, Carin really is the better half...maybe the better 75%:) It was a perfect dim sum afternoon!  We talked, pointed at the carts, ate, talked and ate, talked and ate:)  I think dim sum is as much about conversation and relaxation as about the food...but having said that, having great food really adds to both the conversation and relaxation factor of a great dim sum lunch...and the food was remarkable! It was so good!  There might be a couple of shops that top this place in SFO, but not by much...it's that good! We had all the standards, shrimp rolls, pork buns, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice (outstanding sticky rice, BTW). We had some of the non-standards, tripe, chive dumplings...all delicious and served up with smile! The service was very good...there were always carts in close proximity, and if you saw something a few tables away and flagged a server down, they always made their way over to help you out:) drinks were refilled promptly, and the empty dishes were moved out to make room for new arrivals. The biggest surprise came at the end of our lunch...the total for 6 of us was less than $70!!! I used to spend more than that for dim sum lunch for 2 in SFO (and twice that much in HK)! Amazing! Jim, thanks for organizing! It was a great lunch with a fun group! It's great to know where to get my dim sum fix!",

Nothing fancy, but good American Chinese staple such as Mongolian Beef, Orange Chicken, Stir Fried Chinese Broccolli, Seafood Chowmein and Walnut Shrimp.  We have a thing about Family Style Dinner with lazy susans and they have it here.   For all that food that fed 4 adults and 3 kids with to go boxes was $57!  Can't beat that.  Complimentary hot tea is wonderful this time of the year.  The ingredients was fresh.   I don't know if they have a separate Chinese Menu.  No KID'S MENU, but there are several choices of noodle dishes to chose from.  The dim sum is decent, there's not much choices when we went on a weekday.  I assume they'd have more on the weekend.  We liked China KIng's Dim Sum, much better, but enjoyed the food off the menu at Phoenix more. This is an overall clean and consistent place to go and take your family to.  Oh, yeah, it's not a buffet!  I guess they used to be and never changed the name.",

I ordered the Orange chicken because its a dish that is hard to screw up. Well despite the place being fairly empty and several staff on hand it seemed an eternity before any one took my order. Once my food arrived I dug in only to find the chicken flavorless with barely a hint of orange. It tasted more like sweet and sour sauce of the grocery store variety. I ate 1/5 the plate a decided I could do better at home with a packet of spicy seafood ramen. In the time it has taken for the wait staff to notice that I had given up on their tasteless dish to the time I received the cheque has been an eternity. I will never eat here again and I recommend that you don't waste you time or money. There is a plaque at the front door that claims best of Phoenix... I doubt they would win that award today.",

    "text": "The food is not bad - their egg tarts are really good and their food is fresh only if you get in right before the rush. But the reason for the low rating is that I'm pretty peeved/annoyed at the service I was given today. I even brought in new friends to try out the place and give them more business. Many times  I had to get up and ask for the things we wanted- like water, chili oil, we were pretty much ignored (and I get that, there's some prejudice when you have non-asians -its harder for the servers to communicate with each other). The worst was when I had to walk up to get the bill, get the bill, then return to pay for it. We had 4 cards to pay that was going to end up being over $50 (plus tip), and at first they wouldn't accept our payment. I have never before been refused this request when I was here a month ago. I get that they're annoyed with paying the extra merchant fee, but honestly it's only a few extra cents and it's not like we would each only be paying $5-10 on our card. Plus, it's not that they're dying and going out of business, nor did they have a sign saying this was not allowed. I went up to the manager and he just grabbed the cards in my hands while rolling his eyes at me. After I got our receipts back, I found out that he overcharged each of us by a few dollars, without letting me know... I ended up tipping less than I normally do because I'm pretty annoyed at this kind of service. I don't mind paying more to use my credit card, but all you have to do is treat your customers with an explanation. I also run a business and understand that costs are costs, but don't be cheap about it when you have about 100 other customers in the restaurant, making it look like you're making quite the profit running up other people's credit cards.",

I thought the hagow and shrimp and scallop dumplings had very thick skins, so I discarded them and just ate the fillings. There were no sui mai for an hour and just the same 2 carts going around and around. The sui mai were okay, but lacked shrimp and tasted a bit bland. Finally, some ham shui gok's (fried footballs stuffed with meat) came along with some sesame balls. We ordered the fried footballs and they were stone cold! I told the cart lady and she just shrugged her shoulders, like saying what could she do? Finally some panfried turnip cake came around and it was also cold. The trays of baked goodies came around often and they all looked very good, but we are more fans of the savory, rather than sweet so we felt that the variety was lacking in that department. We never saw any bean curd meat rolls, or stuffed peppers in black bean sauce either?I would give this place another try, but right now I feel The China King had better tasting dim sum plus you can order the fried footballs and turnip cake off the menu and know it will be hot upon arrival. The service staff were also rushing around past our table and that was a bit distracting. Maybe they were not expecting such a large crowd for a Friday?",

A work colleague suggested that we dine here on the way to a corporate meeting.  While I realized that he was a native to the Phoenix Metro Area and had probably never even had the real thing, I trusted his palate and restaurant sense.  I was so pleased when we walked in and saw that the diners were predominately Asian.  I knew that  a great  Asian market was next door as well and these things were the first things that signaled to me that I was probably going to get good food.  I was thrilled to see familiar Dim Sum carts rolling through.  We were a party of 7 and shared around.  The food was fantastic!  Dim sum was fresh and succulent.  Our orders from the menu were equally delicious.  The veggies were fresh and brightly colored.  The tastes distinctive and delicious.  The Hot and Sour Soup was perfect filled with all kinds of Chinese mushrooms etc.  I was delighted and reminisced about the many fantastic dinners in Chinatown NY. This food was comparable.  I do not live close by, but I will be a regular there.  Chandler is clear on the other side of the World from me but I figure if Marco Polo could do it, so can I!  Phoenix Palace is the REAL Thing!!!  Friendly prompt service rounded out the experience.  Hooray for Phoenix Palace!",

She told me to wait and I have seen people running after the staffs to check out (Service Failure). They didn't have the supreme broth dumpling where a signature dim sum place would have in most exquisite places. Compare with those places in Hong Kong, California, and New York, this is a huge step down. The service is always a weak sector of a Asian restaurant and this is no exception because service people are treated like a slave (low people and their face and attitudes reflects that as well). When you have to ask for everything from water, tea refills, even the basic items of the dim sum, it has already lost two stars with me. The seaweed salad is filled with artificial food color which made me sick to my stomach (the dye spill over the sesame seeds). I have ordered duck tongue, crispy roast duck, and jelly fish which are just OK. This place will never survive in California, due to lack of real competition (China King, SIFU, and Golden Budda), it is a winner by default so I will hope to see other giants who will come over here. Even Albuquerque had better dim sum than this.",

Had to get my own water jug to pour my own water.  and the food is absolutely horrible. i wouldn't call it chinese food. i wouldn't even call it asian food. It's edible. that all i can say.  It's a restaurant to fool white people who never had real chinese cuisine.  It's lucky its in AZ, because if this food court were in CA, it would never survive.  NO chinese ppl with a decent palate will ever walk into this imitation panda express which is worse than panda express.  i feel sorry for AZ residents where good cuisine is really lacking.",

    "text": "I have frequent this dim sum restaurants for 10 years.  I think have great food and friendly staff.  Today, the first time we have a bad experience.  My wife and I were having a great dim sum lunch there, when we were about to leave, we saw a bus person cleaning a table across from us in a very unclean way.  He just simply poured left over tea from a tea pot onto the table and used the used tablecloth to clean the table.  The owner of the restaurant happened to be nearby, so we called him over and showed him what the bus person was doing.  The owner simply look at us in surprise, and asked us \"so, what's your problem?\"  I tried to explain to him that as a customer, I expect the table to be cleaned with some sort of disinfectant, not left over tea pouring on a table, and definitely not with a the used tablecloth.  He just look at us and said he rather does this instead of using unsafe chemicals.  At that point, we decided the simplest course for us was to leave, and never to come back.  If what we see in the public area was unclean, then how do we know what sort of thing they do in the kitchen?  maybe the kitchen God there can give us a hint someday.  Anyway, they just lost a customer!  /Nchu",

As soon as we sat down we had 3 push carts by our table (all at once) offering dishes to us. I wanted to get my hot tea first but that came later. We ordered few dishes and kindly told them that was enough for now. Not 5 minutes later, we had 2 more carts pointing things out to us. Not to mention one lady placing dishes we didn't order on our table. We had to tell her 'No' firmly. Another time, we had to say 'no' like 4 times before we can get her to leave us alone to enjoy what was already table full of food. I have never experienced such pushy dim sum ladies in my life.  Food wise, few dishes were lukewarm (expected given the time we arrived) but others were still steaming hot. We were also very hungry and we could've eaten anything at that point. My favorite was the egg noodles stir fried. Everything else was as expected.   I would love to come back here but those ladies are a big turn off for me. Dim sum is meant to be enjoyed leisurely reading a newspaper. If I were to come back, I'd come during their peak time so that they'd be too busy to be harassing us.",

We waited for 30 minutes, received no menus and spent 20 minutes asking for a single sprite, only to be ignored not one, not two, not even three, but for four times. It got to a point where we just had to get up and leave. They were not busy, maybe with 6 or 7 tables. For all I know they could have had decent food, but it's hard to tell when they neglect to serve you. I'd recommend finding somewhere else to get your Chinese food.",

We arrived around 6 pm on New Years Day expecting a short wait, but the restaurant was almost completely empty. It doesn't seem like dinner service here is that popular, even though there's always a wait for dimsum around lunch time.  We ordered 3 dishes to share family style:  Beef chow fun ($10.75) - always such a classic dish, and they do it well here. The beef was very tender and flavored just right.  Hot braised sliced fish ($12.25) - I was disappointed by this dish. We asked our server about this dish before ordering, and she said nothing about it being braised in a sweet and sour sauce (and neither did the description on the menu). I don't like sweet and sour dishes and definitely would not have ordered it had I known. Though I do highly recommend for people who like this type of flavor as the fish itself was fresh and comes coated generously with sauce.  Black bean sauce spare ribs ($10.50) - enjoyed this dish as well. The ribs were tender and came with plenty of bell peppers and onions.  There was a complimentary dessert at the end of the meal of sweet taro soup, which is one of my favorite Chinese dessert soups.  Overall, my parents and I liked Phoenix Palace for dinner and would come back again. Prices for cheap for the portions that we got; the restaurant definitely didn't skimp on the meat.",

I was pleasantly surprised with the frequency of the cart visits. Each cart minded their own business, though - if you ask for something that they don't have, they'll just tell you to wait.   We ordered the shrimp dumplings, shumai, sweet rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaf, ribs, turnip cake, and lots of desserts. I recommend the turnip cake and the shrimp dumplings!

    "text": "Prologue: I've dined at this restaurant for dim sum a few times in the past, however my fiancee had not and so we decided to give it a try together.  The Plot: We ordered several of our usual favorite dim sum, including Pai Gwut (steamed pork ribs), Fong Djau (steamed chicken feet), Nor Mai Gai (sticky rice in lotus leaf), and Ngau Paak Yip (steamed beef tripe). We also tried a couple of items that were new for us, including Baked Pineapple Roll with Egg Custard Filling and Cake Roll with Shredded Pork Filling.  The Scene: My impression after this visit on the weekend is that their Dim Sum dining is now noticeably better, and consequently busier, than on my previous visits. In particular was a greater variety of deserts, including the Baked Pineapple Roll mentioned above. Anyone who is a fan of Daan Taat (Egg Tarts) should enjoy the Pineapple Roll as much as we did. My fiancee, who is a native of mainland China, and I have never before had a dim sum item like the Cake Roll with Shredded Pork. The opportunity to try either one of these items would make a visit to this restaurant worthwhile.  The Rest of the Story: The restaurant was very busy on a weekend afternoon; however we were seated within reasonable amount of time. The service was prompt and courteous and the prices are standard for this level of dim sum.  Epilogue: As good as this place is now while also being so close to home, this is now our go to place for weekend dim sum.  Photo design by Billie Z.",

    "text": "Pretty good dim sum spot, except you can rack up a pretty hefty bill!   So there's mostly only a couple of spots to get dim sum in Phoenix that I consider note-worthy: Great Wall (too far for me), Mekong, and Phoenix Palace.   I usually go to Mekong but I decided a change of scenery was good because my parents usually like going to Phoenix palace!   First things first, the service is way better here than at Mekong. Mostly because the square footage that the cart pushers have to cover is a lot less! I also enjoyed the difference menu options that I'm usually not used to seeing at Mekong!  Everything was hot, and most of the food was good, some of it was hit or miss though. Like for instance the har gao (shrimp rice ball) was super tiny, compared to other places that have it. However the shu mai (pork meat dumpling) was huge compared to the other places!  To lo mai kai (sticky rice) was actually kinda dry, which was odd!   However the service definitely makes up for just some of the foods that didn't taste as good as I get from other places! I will say though that the prices of some dishes are a lot more pricey than it's competitors like Mekong, which I believe is a flat rate for most of the normal dishes.   All in all, I'm kinda torn between whether I'd come here or not. Overall it was a great experience, but I also spent $116 treating out my family, which usually id end up with a $80 at Mekong. Try both, and see which one you like!",

Of course, the usual language problems and the tendency to try to overload us with everything on the cart, but that's to be expected. But the food was real good and especially the pork buns were quite loaded.   Just be sure you know what you're getting - we wound up with a hot dog dim sum, LOL.   Go with a crowd if you can, and try to stay away from the first table near the door.",

For you first timers, there are no directions once you are seated, the nice ladies come around to your table with their carts and they tell you ( the best they can) what they are serving. Once you say yes, they put their mark on the ticket. I would have liked more veg and noodle dishes, but was unaware until after we were finished eating that you can order different foods directly from the kitchen!!! The food was great, service was really good, great family experience, affordable, and plenty of parking- BUT come early on Sundays it gets CROWDED!!! This place is a gotta try!!!TS",

Moo-shu (sp?) pork is also one of my favorite dishes here. They also have a Take out deli with prepared to-go items. I am always very pleased when I dine here at Phoenix Palace.

We knew it would be a bit awkward for us gringos walking into a place that is geared towards Asians with foul hanging in the window.  To be seated we were asked if we were there for lunch or dim sum, we said lunch and were escorted to the cheap seats.  Upon viewing the menu, I realized there were virtually no vegetarian options. The only thing I saw was the fried tofu.  The included egg drop soup was not vegetarian either.    When my meal finally came, it was not what I expected. It was basically nine battered and fried pieces of tofu with rice on the side. Despite looking quite good, the batter was devoid of any flavor, and the tofu was extremely soft which was not the ideal texture.   This meal was not too cheap either and I left hungry. At least for lunch this is far from being on my list of places to go.  PS this is not a buffet despite the name",

    "text": "Ok, so usually I expect Chinese places to all be the usual stir fry style, takeout menu, not really unique kind of food.  Which is ok, because I love that particular food.  But something sets Phoenix Palace a notch above the rest.  The menu looked great, and I floundered over what to get, until we saw the family style options on the back.  For a flat rate per-person, you get soup to share, a plate of appetizers, and as many entrees as you have people.  That sounded perfect, and we got a nice variety of food to share with the table.    The hot and sour soup was very tasty, and with a little soy sauce added, not too hot for my mild palette.  The crab puffs and egg rolls were top notch.  Sweet and Sour Chicken tasted like it was made with real quality chicken, had fresh breading, and flavorful sauce.  The Broccoli Beef had really tender meat and veggies, and is easily my favorite version of that dish from what I've tried elsewhere.  The Kung Pao Chicken wasn't as spicy as I expected, which was a good thing for me.  We had more than enough food, and the leftovers proved delicious the second time around too.  The service was attentive, though there was a bit of a language barrier.  I appreciate the authenticity of the restaurant all the way around.  This may very well turn in to my go-to Chinese food!",

    "text": "07/20/11  2.75 stars.  Was shopping for tamarind candy and pan de sal at Lee Lee's, whiling away time before I was to meet an aunt at Mekong Plaza to dine at one (or two) of the food kiosks there, when I received a text from her saying she'd been in an accident.  Dropping everything, I met her at the scene.  An hour and a half later (she's not hurt, and the other driver was ticketed), I was starving for nourishment and aunt was not, so we headed back to the Lee Lee plaza to wait for her ride.  I was craving for noodles and was heading to Pho Van, when we walked by Phoenix Palace and decided I'd give it another try, as aunt gave it a green light, and I remembered from reading \"recent\" reviews that it was under \"new\"  management.  (Last time I visited was two years ago.)  A child host greeted and sat us at a booth.  (OK, she's Asian, so she probably was 13 years old... I know how it is... when I was 18, people thought I was 12, and now I'm... well, let's just get back to the review, shall we?)  We both ordered water, and I studied the menu.  After about ten minutes, the server that kept walking by our table finally approached to ask if I we were ready to order.  I asked if the BBQ pork lo mein came w/ vegetables.  He said that the chow mein had mushrooms, but the lo mein would not have any veggies.  \"No veggies?,\" I asked.  Can you add some?  He said, after some thought, \"bok choy,\" and I said yes.  I also asked if broccoli and snow peas can be added.  He said OK.  \"No celery, or carrots, OK?\"  He nodded yes.  I also ordered a batch of crab puffs.  The crab puffs arrived 15 minutes later, all golden-brown and smelled wonderful.  I liked the crunch of the fresh-from-the-fryer wonton wraps, but found that the sweetened cream cheese and crab filling too sweet.  I decided to eat a couple before the entree and save the rest for dessert.  (I found that I enjoyed the crab puffs more when I thought of it as a dessert, and not as an appetizer.)  The lo mein arrived four minutes after (19 minutes after time of order), looking delicious, but definitely cooked w/ carrots.  I didn't complain and let the matter drop.  I'd only expected bok choy, broccoli, and snow peas; Instead, I saw bok choy, carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, spring onions, and garlic!  The exclusion of broccoli was A-OK- I hadn't really wanted it in there; I just didn't want \"just bok choy.\"  The dish was very good!  Loved the sauce that it was sauteed in, though the BBQ pork was a little too fatty for my taste- I worked around it.  What I really didn't enjoy were the pieces of bitter bok choy.  Some were sweet, and after finding two bitter chunks, I thought I'd see if there was a reason why they were bitter.  A-ha!  Those that were bitter were bites close to bases of the stalks, which had particles that looked like dirt, while those that tasted sweet were cubed pieces, or stalks that didn't contain those dirt-like particles (see photos).  Needless to say, I felt less-enthused about the noodles after that.  Back to those crab puffs!  Server was unobtrusive, but could be found, if I needed him.  The woman who gave me the ticket and my fortune cookie was very sweet...  OK, Phoenix Palace.  One more strike in a few months, or maybe two years, and you're out!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=ygt_oEC7K_ukEGlFdMWpow\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqS...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=f7Ci-_b6cb0BZg3QgvZHYg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqS...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g?select=PHZJQhzvrwBhmsxWV5aYDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rNqS...</a>",

And maybe it's because I enjoy the bastardized Hawaiian version more, but I lament the lack of options in Arizona for Chinese that I find tasty.    Fortunately, this place has great dim sum that is as good as most places I've been to in Hawaii. I'm sure \"real\" Chinese people (I'm Chinese but people have accused me of not being a real Chinese person) will say this isn't actual Chinese food or dim sum, and doesn't hold a candle to SF. I'm sure that's True but this place is good in my book.  My favorite items here are the XLB, chow mein, spareribs, bean curd roll.  They are delicious.  I personally don't like their potstickers because they have a strange fishy taste to me, which I'm not accustom to in potstickers (however, I don't like seafood so take my advice with a grain of salt on this front).",

She was friendly, helpful, and just an overall very positive person and I really enjoyed having her as our waitress. This is pretty rare in a Chinese restaurant. Food was good. Prices are fairly reasonable but dang snow pea leaves cost $16.95 that's pretty darn expensive.   I returned for dimsum the next day (with a batch of other waitresses), and the service was, as expected, nonexistent to borderline rude. And since when is ha gao and a variety of other items considered \"large\". The only small items were chicken feet and all the other dishes were large and I've had dimsum for the last 20 years and I know which dishes are in what category. It's not a big deal since the price difference is very small so it acutally doesn't make a difference but I'm not sure why they think it's a good idea to mark everything large while it's probably smarter to make most items mediums and make a larger price gap (opps!)",

Food and experience are what you know if you've lived in China, only minus the grand hall.  Pastries, seaweed salad, duck, sui mai, noodle and rice dished, bok choi, and other servings were all yummers, cooked well, and with fast-paced fun.  Clean restaurant and it was fun watching the nine year-old hostess manage the surges of customers.  Staff was quick and accommodating.  As usual with dim sum, it can add up and become expensive if you get careless with taking too much.  Affordable if you don't go crazy.  We'll be back...",

    "text": "I'm up waiting for laundry so I thought I'd catch up on all of my food adventure reviews.   You know in the east valley vicinity there is absolutely NO dim sum fare worth the money. Maybe maybe maybe the one inside me kong.   I have visited a number of dim sum restaurants in many different states and this one by far has got to be the worst one.   I've been here at least 10 times because people keep wanting to try it and I keep telling them no but they want dim sum. Whatever. You pay I'll come be your side kick.   When we visited phoenix palace they came by our table many times and we got a few dishes to start and they came back mid finishing of the dishes and we declined and then they came back again but we were still working on what we had so we asked them to come by later. Well.... Maybe we should have jumped at the opportunity of getting something else but they didn't come by anymore. So after flagging down a wait staff to order rice rolls we finished that and that was it. My friend went to go pay and I had gotten up to use the restroom. Just then a lady staff member stopped me and said excuse me but tip is not included with your bill. I was so puzzled. First we hadn't officially left, second I was going to be restroom and lastly if they didn't have us go pay at the register maybe they would have known that we left the tip on the charge card. I literally paid a dollar to leave the table and go to the bathroom and didn't even go. I'm so glad I didn't cause a scene it's not worth it. I also came to the front and told the gal who sat us what happened and gave her $4 more dollars to tip the other wait staff and advised them they really shouldn't treat their patrons like this... Unfortunately, the word hasn't gotten out. I told my friend about this and they laughed bc the same thing happened to them. So maybe it's time to review this place.   Food: 2 stars. You have to know how to mix sauces for it to taste ok.  Atmosphere: it's a Chinese restaurant that serves dim sum. I didn't make it to the bathroom so I can't tell you how clean it is. They are slow to seat you but rush you out but if you go on a slow day there's nobody there so it seems like they don't make fresh foods.   Staff: 0 stars this place has changed hands and management. I don't worry about how great personalities are in places like this but the cross guard at the end of the meal totally  made me feel angry. I'm easily disappointed but rarely do I get pissed. I think there's a huge opportunity to have really good dim sum here that is strictly dim sum and really only needs to be open 3-4 days a week. This is how other places I've gone to operate.   Will I recommend this place? I've been against it since the second set of owners didn't improve but every time... \"They have new owners maybe it's different.\" Yep NO it hasn't improved.   What would I change? We need to call Gordon Ramsay on this one.   The only pro: take out roasted meats hanging in the windows.",

We were promptly served but almost forcibly served certain dishes.   We almost felt as if we had to take the dishes as rushed as we were being made to feel, yet the restaurant was pretty empty. We had Pork Belly (a chewy, gummy gelatinous mess stuck to the bone) that I took one bite of. The rest of our typical dim sum items were great.   I give the restaurant 3 stars for cleanliness, promptness and service aside from the dim sum server. We will be back to give it a second go round- at a much earlier time.",

    "text": "Growing up in SoCal where dim sum is known to be some of the best in the United States, I came to Arizona not expecting a whole lot from their dim sum scene. I was right as Phoenix Palace can't compare to dim sum in Cali. Their chicken feet tasted stale and did not have the tender quality of the skin that I enjoy. Their beef as well as shrimp rice noodles were of poor quality as I could not taste the flavors of the meat and seafood. Their BBQ pork bun wasn't too bad, but did not have enough of the BBQ flavor that I normally taste. Their fried turnip cake lacked any savory flavor and was too plain. Their duck egg and minced pork porridge was too watery which overpowered the egg and pork flavors. Their Gai Lan with oyster sauce was decent, about the only thing I felt was passable. It was almost empty the 2 times that I came, once on a weekday afternoon and once on a weekend morning, so service was friendlier and more efficient because there was no busy rush for the staff.",

    "text": "I'm really disappointed to leave a bad review because I was so excited about my trip across town for dim sum.  I normally head to Great Wall on Camelback but the pictures for Phoenix Palace looked awesome.  So thought I'd try a new place.  Unfortunately it was the most unbelievable experience I've had in quite a while.    First off, we arrive and took a few minutes to be seated.  That's fine. No worries there.  As we sat waiting for carts and hopefully a waitress to grab us some drinks, the staff walked by us numerous times.  Not in a manner that they were urgently helping other customers. Just wandering around.  Again, that didn't bug us one bit.    Few minutes go by again, finally the first cart and waitress head to our table at the same time.  Now, while they are both at our table,  we try to order our drinks but the waitress is too busy talking to the lady with the cart.  All she hears is hot tea for a split second and bolts.  I actually was hoping for just a water but ok.  But that was after we were trying to select our dim sum from the cart.  Every split second we tried to order, the waitress interrupts us to talk with the cart lady.  That went on for a few minutes.   Second bad experience was when the same cart lady pulls up with another cart a while later with different options.  She pulls straight up to our table and then a customer walks right up and places an order with her.  So the cart lady pulls her cart 5 feet away from our table and helps the lady instead.  After she finishes that up, she takes the cart away and heads to the other side of the room that she already came from.  Completely ignoring us.   Next we were hoping to order a few items that didn't seem to be on the carts.  That seemed to be what was going on with all the other tables around us.  Every time we tried to flag anyone down, we were ignored for the tables that had Chinese customers.  Granted, we are Asian as well.  Just Thai nationality.  But clearly ignored for not being Chinese.    The experience is far worse than what I'm describing because I'm trying to sum it up quickly but I wanted to at least give a low down.    We made the firm decision that we would never be returning.  The only person who cared for our attention and gave us any kindness was the second cart lady who didn't speak any English.  We have never experienced this bad of service at Great Wall. Even though it's not fantastic service, we are never ignored to the point of what we experienced today.",

Only downfall it is incredibly smushed together and sometimes the carts don't always make it to the tables in the middle, so definitely request a perimeter table.  Larger parties seem to get seating priority which can make going as a party of 2 a little frustrating, but other than that I have no qualms.  Will continue to come back!",

Not everyone can make them at home or they require all day and the right tools; so usually most Chinese rather go to a restaurant who serves Dim Sum. I have tried most of the Asian restaurants who serve Dim Sum and so far Phoenix Palace live up to the quality. The servers are always friendly and helpful when we request special orders. One of the reasons we choose here for family gatherings or celebrate special occasions.",

Some carts will stop by to ask what you like and some fly by without getting you a chance to see what is available.  We had so many dishes, so I will only comments on the ones that I remember.  Pros: Lai Bak Go (Taro Fried Cakes) - Warm, perfected fried on both sides, and tasty Shu Mai (Dumplings) - Pretty large sizes, good taste, and warm Char Sui Bao (Steamed BBQ Pork Buns) - BBQ was flavorful and steamed perfectly Pork and Preserved Egg Rice Soup - OMG, good!!!

Their dim sum is not as good as the other place such as C-Fu but since I am in love with their sauce so much, I came back every time for dim sum. However, their service is just horrible. The people delivering foods can hardly even speak any English. In addition, their attitude towards customer was unacceptable. I used to be a waitress so I know what should be a standard service. When I asked for some extra sauce, they clearly give me a disgusting look and roll the eyes over me like I'm not even their customer. They even speak in Chinese to the other employees and I can realize through their tune saying bad thing about me and my friend. What's wrong with you? I go to a restaurant and I certainly can pay for any extra cost for the sauce. If it's needed to be charged, I'll pay for it but just don't give me that dirty look especially when you work at a service industry. I'm your customer and I should get at least some respect. It's even horrible that they ask for tip when I don't think they deserve it. They try to make tip a mandatory thing when it's optional. And I strongly don't feel like they deserve it. It's horrible that they think they treat customer like that and still get paid for a good amount of tips. It's non-sense. I don't know how good your food is, but there are tons of restaurants out there that might have the same or even better food quality than you guys. So be cautious about how you treat your customers or else you guys might be out of business soon for such attitude.",

We also ordered barbecue pork bun, this was the worst I have ever had. They did not have much meat. It was like full of a red sauce. Really gross. I also ordered barbecue pork fried rice, it was super oily and the barbecue pork was bland.   When I paying for my food I noticed they had rice cake. I was super happy and ordered some to go with my take out order. I have fond memories of my childhood eating rice cake as a special treat. That too was dashed in my first bite. Tasted like they put some kind funky chemical sugar in it. Too bad. This was my first time and last time there.",

Since there were only the two of us, they seated us in the back room.  I was a bit apprehensive since I was afraid that service with the carts would be slow.  But surprisingly, I think we had better service back there than I have ever had over the last five years or so.  In fact, within 10 minutes, we got all the dishes we wanted.  Since there was only the two of us, we could only eat so much, so after 10 dishes or so, we stopped ordering since we couldn't eat any thing else.  Oh yeah, we also saw roast pork on one of the carts, but like I said before, it looked pretty nasty.  I didn't want to take the chance and order it, only to be disappointed once again.  But the rest of the dim sum seemed OK and we were satisfied.",

I don't see many dim sum places that still serve it on a cart, especially ones are able to pan-fry food.   A lot of the dim sum ladies are Cantonese (especially those who can speak my dialect) so it was easy to converse with them about getting more bowls, food to go, etc. Since we arrived very soon after opening, all of them started crowding around our table. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and we got an absurd amount of food (rice crepe, baked bbq pork buns, egg tarts, steamed tripe, Chinese gai lan, sweet soft tofu, steamed bbq pork buns, shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, etc)  I liked that they served soft tofu table-side and had to-go containers at the bottom of each cart so if you wanted more, they would give you the item and the container at that very moment instead of asking a waiter at the end of your meal.   I don't think this is the best dim sum I've had but if you're looking for nostalgia and craving dim sum, this will definitely suit your needs.",

My companion and I came here just before 10am and we were surprised that they actually opened at 9:30am. The restaurant was only occupied by a few people when we walked in so we were immediately placed at a table near the kitchen and then the carts of beautiful dim sum came for us. 20 mins in and we realized we got way too much food and started getting items boxed up to go. We ended up trying to track down this lady with the cart that had the egg tarts after continuously assuring her we would get some towards the end of our meal. I highly HIGHLY recommend coming around 10:15am on the weekend. Why? I saw other items pop up as we were finishing our meal. Items like roasted pork and duck, fried rice in individual servings, turnip cake, etc. We left at 10:40 am and the place was already 90% packed. I'm sure you won't be waiting long if you do decide to come after that. The food is fast, service is great and I am definitely coming back! $25 per person is a good estimate for the price here.",

The Chinese turnip cake is pretty bad here.  Because of it not tasting well nor pan frying we asked, it inspired me to learn how to make this dish.  I've only made it once but WAY better tasting than Phoenix Palace.  None of the Dim Sum dishes tasted too great.  It's edible sort of, but I would compare it in taste to like McDonalds for burgers.  You can eat it, but not that great if experience or taste.  I normally stuff myself at Dim Sum but not at Phoenix Palace.  My youngest brother was not happy we went here for Dim Sum.  It's worth driving to Mekong in Mesa instead.  Last time I'm eating here.  The last time we ate here was probably 2-3 years ago and even my Colombian husband doesn't care for this place, which says a lot.  Not sure how they've managed to stay in business.",

    "text": "I've been eating dim sum here for 23 years, since around 1995 when that owner offered AYCE dim sum buffet during the weekdays for about  $7.00.  I just ate dim sum here today Sunday Aug 5, 2018.  I host dim sum events for Wild Dining MeetUp.  Today's group was only 6 people, my smallest group ever.    I really appreciate that Phoenix Palace is willing to let me make reservations for dim sum, although they said they will only hold the table for 5 min, I find that very reasonable, given that there are people waiting outside.  My party is most often at least 10 people, sometimes I host 2 tables of that many, so reservations are needed, which I make at 11 am when they are not too busy.  One thing I do not like about PP  dim sum, is the cart ladies often put items on your table that you did not want, and it seems they are \"forcing it on you\", as if they receive a commission for being able to mark that item on your card.  This happens almost every time I go eat dim sum at PP.  They keep putting their dishes on my table, that no one said they wanted and trying to mark the card, and seem reluctant to take the dish back cos I say I don't want it.  Their English is so poor, that they don't seem to get that I want \"sui mai\" (I guess because it wasn't on their cart).  Things like that.    Chinese restaurants that have a lot of young Chinese male servers are famous for poor service.  I and others think it is because Chinese males are being catered to all their lives, so thy do not have to think about \"needs\", such as \"when you serve a urn of soup, people need spoons to eat the soup with\".  Chinese males are not \"cognizant and observant\" to anticipate your need, such as when they see you spilled something, you need more napkins to clean up with.  No one ever comes to fill our teapot, and everything we want, we have to run after, and flag down the servers, but being this is \"usual service\", I am not marking down to three stars because the food makes up for it, and they are the only dim sum venue that I know of, that is willing to take reservations, even for party of 4.  When eating at truly authentic Chinese restaurants, I just get up and get my own bowls, forks, and other things I need, myself, otherwise my neck will be forever craned, looking for a server, instead of enjoying my food.    Battling with the cart ladies, the lack of service, makes dim sum stressful to me.  Also this visit, we were seated by the entrance, which was REALLY HOT!!!  The 110 degree heat came in the front doors, and their AC, they said was turned lowest, cannot keep up with all those people and those steaming carts.  I was trying to fan my face with the dim sum card, and another lady took out something from her purse to fan herself.  There was a glow of sweat on the faces of the male servers too.    I cannot tell in words, the difference between \"which has better dim sum\", Great Wall or Phoenix Palace.  Both are good, just do not go to either on weekdays, because the dim sum isn't hot or fresh due to low turnover and consumption, and weekday selection is only a fraction of what they offer on the weekends.   I like PP better than Great Wall (don't care for Mekong Palace so I don't go there) because PP takes reservations, and PP is close to my home to drive to via 101.  I can also stop at LeeLee's, which I do not have a secondary destination if I drive all the way (from 87th Street to 35th Ave on Camelback).  Phoenix Palace also has lazy susans, which Great Wall has, but for some poor management reason, only puts out for dinner, and not for weekend dim sum.",

The woman at the cash register did open up became more friendly and outgoing as she packed up the part of our order that was taking a while.  Shrimp ball: Bland, not crunchy enough, probably my least favorite   Shoumai: Great texture, very meaty.  BBQ pork bun: More savory than most, a lot less sugary and more authentic than the hot pink varieties many places have.  Really great.  Spareribs: Very moist but very fatty, my second least favorite.  Baked custard bun: Extremely good!  Fluffy and really good when warm.  Not too sweet,  Egg tart: Now here's where the sugar is.  Very sweet but good.  Sesame seed ball: Nice mild sweetness level of black bean inside, but they were too crispy/overcooked.  I'm still not sure whether is was the sweet or sticky rice cake, but think it was sweet...the white dessert ones...were very light, chewy, and definitely a great dessert without the heaviness of custard or being deep fried.",

Its kind of like tapas style, except dim sum comes ready-made and ready-to-eat to you in carts pushed by people. This place is busy on the weekends, but proves to be an excellent place to enjoy this style of dining. Check out the photo to see some of the things I ate (BBQ pork buns, egg tart custard, Chinese broccoli, shu Mai, soup dumpling, etc)....I passed on the chicken feet.",

There's a good variety of dim sum items available.  Prices are reasonable.  We had the shrimp dumplings, lotus leaf rice, barbeque pork buns, pork and shrimp dumplings, tofu skin roll, chicken feet, tripe, beef balls, rice noodle rolls, and savory stuffed dumplings.  The food was decent flavor-wise but the downside was that everything was only lukewarm except for the savory stuffed dumplings.  We got the savory stuffed dumplings towards the end of our meal.  Had we started eating a little later when the restaurant was busier, we probably would have had hotter food since there would be higher turnover.  My favorite dishes were the savory stuffed dumplings, tripe, shrimp dumplings, and lotus leaf rice.",

I've yet to find anything in Arizona that even comes close to the freshness and amazing quality of what I'm used to.   That being said, during the 3 years that I've lived in Arizona, I have seen the quality of dim sum that Phoenix Palace serves increase--their shrimp dishes used to be completely inedible, as were many of their dishes containing pork. The restaurant is generally clean, but they often do not serve you water unless you personally request it, and it is definitely not filtered/clean/pure water - it tastes like it came from a rusty tap, in my opinion. We prefer their chrysanthemum tea over green, so be sure to make a special request if you want to try it. The one plus side of this location is that their business is steady so they're able to offer a large variety of dim sum.   Given the very few options we have here, this place is one of the better ones, although we prefer Mekong Palace in Mesa--and despite living close to Phoenix Palace, we usually make the longer drive to Mesa for dim sum more similar to the quality that we are used to.",

My husband did not eat anything but did ordered an iced tea in which I was charged $2.79 for... so I don't understand what the \"guest\" fee of $0.65 cent was for. I'm also positive that they overcharged me. I only ate the a small cup soup, beef ripe and  shrimp dumplings and I drank water. My bill was $16.10? Wow. I won't be back.

The place was very busy and Dim Sum carts were everywhere.  The Dim Sum cart ladies were blunt and unfriendly to us and the nearby tables; not to mention they were pushy with their fellow cart colleagues.  One actually shoved her coworker's cart right out of the aisle with her cart and headed to the next table to sell her food.  As customers finished their meals and started leaving, the carts never came by our table again until we made a specific request.  In addition to the poor service, the food wasn't nearly as good as other Dim Sum places in the area.  The food we received was fine, but the selection was surprisingly dismal & quite limited, and special orders took well over 20 minutes.   First time I've left a Dim Sum restaurant feeling hungry.  Won't be back and can't recommend this place.",

Many of the items I love (shrimp and peppers, eggplant and a few others you should probably order up front because for the 1.5 hours we were there, both times I never saw them).  On that note the rice flour shrimp rolls has to be ordered as well.  But the good news they have them!  1) Shrimp rolls: very good today and fresh! 2) Shrimp crispy roll: I love the small versions.  Theses were huge and every bite had 3-5 little shrimps.  Not a hit for us but crispy! 3) Steamed Pork & shrimp dumplings: I can't have them (mushrooms) but always my sons favorite! 4) Steamed shrimp dumplings: My favorite when the shrimp is fresh and they were.  Hint: 1st timers mix some soy sauce and Sriracha together for a dip! 5) Custom order: Fried rice with chicken. No taste at all.  Pass. 6) Spicy crispy chicken: a little too hot for us but really good. 7) Special order: Green pepper with shrimp (and the black bean sauce): yummy! 8) Sesame balls (red bean paste inside, best when hot).  Note; squish in half to get two beautiful even pieces!",

They were kind enough to take off from their busy schedule to drive from all over town just to meet up for one afternoon.  I do have dreadful memories of this place, and the prolonged waits. But, they have since improved upon that train wreck of system, and they now allow reservations for Dim Sum weekends.  It was so surprising, and refreshing to walk up at the appointed time, and be seated right away. No fuss. No muss. No prolonged waits in the tiny lobby.   They put our party of 6 at a large table, with more than adequate room to satiate our desire to order everything that is presented to us. I do recall that they used to have a more varied Dim Sum menu. It seems that they have pared down some over the years. My last visit here was nearly 5 years ago.  The place was bustling, and rightfully so! The food is still spectacular. We had the XLB's, Siomai, roast duck, chow mein, fried shrimp, steamed pork buns, and, of course, various desserts!  Service was excellent as always. This place continues to be a favorite of ours.",

It is easily to make my table full with food in a matter of few minutes. I love the atmosphere and the food here. I love to enjoy variety of steamed dumplings with chili oil and soy sauce. I like their custard bun and egg tart. Noodle and veggie are delicious.   I always packed some leftovers and enjoy them later on that day or the next day. They have a counter for you to order if you won't want to eat in.",

It's like a little culinary adventure.    There's a language barrier for me and normally, that's fine.  I get it and I'm respectful because it's my fault I don't speak the language so I try to make it as painless as possible.  There was a wait on Saturday, which is expected.  They were busy so I wasn't expecting prime service, I get it.    It started with our host, who sat us at our table and asked if we wanted water and immediately walked away without waiting for a response.  She returned with our waters and when we asked for hot tea, she rolled her eyes, sighed out loud and walked to get the tea without asking what kind we would like.  We had to ask twice for cups for the tea.    The ladies pushing the carts were straight up rude and dismissive.  They passed us by several times, then would give us expensive plates that we didn't ask for and assumed we would want.  I came in craving shumai and left overpaying for over cooked noodles and generic deep fried food that I didn't want.  No, I won't be returning to this spot.  I think there's better experiences in dim sum in the world.  The food here wasn't that great and I wouldn't be able to recommend this experience to anyone.",

Dim sum is not refined nor have a big variety, but understandably so for current Phoenix Asian population standards.  The restaurant needs cleaner restrooms and more customer service improvements. Do not go after 1pm for Dim Sum even rhough dim sum is served until 3pm.  The kitchen stops cooking, so customers are only served what is left on the carts, which are left over choices that are either going old (stale bbq buns, hardened pan fried dumpling skins, etc.) or luke warm to cold temperature food.",

They seated us at a dirty table, didn't give us an order form, and had multiple people ask us if we wanted something to drink but didn't actually bring us anything.

Arriving just after open on Memorial Day, our party of four was immediately seated, and immediately swarmed by the little ladies pushing carts of food around. And by immediate, I mean they swooped before I could even take my seat, so I was left awkwardly standing for a few minutes.   We got a few of our usual dishes and tucked in. The ha gow, usually one of my favorite dim sum dishes, was... abysmal. The wrapper was thick, and the inside was floury and fell apart in your mouth (not in a good way) and didn't even taste like shrimp. The roast duck was probably my favorite dish here, and it was pretty decent. We also had shrimp rice noodle roll, which was not bad. The tofu skin roll was okay, too. The Cantonese soy sauce chow mein was fine; it wasn't super flavorful but it also wasn't drowning in oil, which I always appreciate. The cocktail buns tasted only like coconut and were a little dry.   I'm still a meh on Phoenix Palace. I'd go if everyone else insisted, but would rather brave the crowds at Mekong.",

We got the sate fried rice, sweet and sour pork, salt and pepper squid, salt and garlic fish, and shrimp lo mein. Not one item tasted decent. The fried rice tasted like old rice that was mixed in with meats. There were huge clumps of white rice all over and no flavor. The only flavor was old stale rice. The lo mein was better but again, no flavor and they only filled up the box half way. The squid had a bitter taste to it and the fish was hard. Oh and the pork.... I was a little upset that their idea of sweet and sour pork was to over fried some pork and place onions and peppers onto it. They didn't even take their time to fry it together a little so that the flavors meld together. The bell pepper and onions tasted so raw and wrong.   And the icing on top of the cake has to be the guy ringing us up. I asked for extra hot chili oil and his reply was I can only give you 3. Okay so me spending 70 bucks for dinner only gets me 3 small measly sauce cups of chili oil?   I absolutely love dim sum here but I would stay away if you want to order off their dinner menu.",

I grew up eating dim-sum on the weekends when I would have to visit my grandparents in San Francisco, so I'm very much stuck to this routine and try to do it as often as possible.   Whenever my husband and I want dim sum, our first thought is the Phoenix Palace in Chandler! Why? Because there is a great amount of options, the food is delicious and if you want something beyond dim sum you can certainly order that (like a noodle dish or regular lunch/dinner option).   Be aware, this place gets very busy on a Saturday and Sunday. Although this place gets busy they are hustling and you will quickly be seated. If you don't want to sit and eat here, you can always order in advance and pick up to take home; which I'm very guilty of doing a lot.   Just to explain how much this place is home away from home, my grandmother was born and raised in Hong Kong and loves this place. When she comes to visit from the Bay Area she always asks to come here and even hosted a huge family gathering here when my family was in town for my wedding. Yes, my family and I are fans. If you like dim sum and Chinese food, you will be one too.",

Weekends are their busiest days because everybody and their mom (literally) will be there and the wait to be seated can be anywhere from 5-30 minutes. But with the busiest days comes more fresh food because they have to keep up with the demands.   If you go during the weekdays, they're typically not that busy in comparison to the weekends. But with that comes less fresh food because there's not as much demand.   So choose which you prefer? I tend to find weekends to be better even with a little bit slower service because the food is fresher.",

Shrimp is my favorite, and for me the pinnacle is the seafood roll, with a bit of cream cheese inside the crispy crust.  The only problem with dim sum here is how to choose from the array of delights as the carts approach the table.  The solution is to get takeout to bring home after lunch, enough for a couple days of culinary joy.  The staff also can provide a takeout menu with handy lists that can be filled out in advance.  I haven't yet, but am prepared to go by with a list to present for a takeout order, if my ongoing craving for this food becomes overwhelming and I have no plans for a sit-down lunch.  Being from San Francisco, Chinese food has always been part of my food fantasies.  I'm so glad I discovered Phoenix Palace so I can experience the best.",

I'm a dim sum lover and I wish I could go every weekend, but that would totally destroy my diet!  Needless to say, Phoenix Palace is one of my favorite dim sum places in Phoenix.  They offer up some traditional products like Siu Mai, Nai Wong Bao, Phung Chows, and Cha Sui Baos.  Moreover, they also have some newer products and I gather it's for the more American guest like fried noodles, fried rice and calamari.  All good, but some times I wish they would just stick with tradition.    Overall, the dim sum is pretty good and one of the best in my opinion of what we can get in Phoenix.  It'll get the job done as they say, but don't expect it to blow your mind away.  Service here has improved through the years and afterwards you can always stop by Lee Lee's to get your Asian groceries.  Just a skip and a hop away is a Boba place so you might as well get your entire Asian fix on and done! - Enjoy",

    "text": "pros: - huge variety of dimsum (especially on weekends) - high quality meat - yummy desserts  cons: - metallic water - some dishes are fresher than others  i've been pleased each time i've had dim sum here. i order mango custard buns, sesame seed balls with red bean paste, steamed barbeque pork buns, sticky rice, shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice noodles, and chow mein.  the mango custard buns are sweet and the bread is fluffy. it is topped with crispy coconut shavings, and makes the perfect dessert. the sesame balls are also great for dessert, as they have a crunchy outside and a sweet inside consisting of glutinous rice flour and red bean paste. the steamed barbeque pork buns are a favorite of mine, as they melt in your mouth and you can detect a hint of honey along with the nice pork flavor. the sticky rice has a bit of a bitter flavor but a great consistency, and has a fill of chicken and a piece of a hot dog in the middle. the shrimp dumplings have a bit too fishy a flavor for my taste but are otherwise good. the shrimp rice noodles didn't have this problem, and the sauce they were topped with had a perfect amount of salt and flavor. tastly, the chow mein was surprisingly flavorful and i loved the large amount of bean sprouts that were in it.   my main complaint about this place was actually the water. it tastes pretty metallic, as if it had come straight out of the tap. otherwise, this place is great for dimsum. go on the weekends for the food carts and greatest variety of dishes.",

They were good but not best, a small step down from Great wall or China King. But the Egg tart and Pineapple buns really impressed me! If the Pineapple bun served right from oven, it must be heavenly good!!  The service was fine, but no one served water until we ordered chrysanthemum tea. But this place was not so crowed like Great Wall or China King. We didn't have to wait in lines even on Sunday morning.",

The carts speed by you very quickly but slowly die off in frequency at the end of your meal.  The only reason I feel that this is the best Dim Sum in the Valley is that they take reservations unlike their competitors. I can have a group of 20 people and they will reserve no problem, well, at least when I schedule at 10:30am.  The golden gem in the Dim Sum selection is the curry tendon, melt-in-your mouth tendon that has a great curry flavor. No other Dim Sum place in Phoenix has it.",

Be sure to be seated in the large main dining room as we were seated in a rear banquet room and it was hard to get the attention of the servers and their rolling carts. Yes get there early or expect a wait at peak brunch on weekends. Service was good and prices reasonable. Bring friends so you can try more things.  There is also the LeeLee Chinese Market in the same shopping mall and worth a visit on its own.",

It was fairly crowded when I got there but I was still able to get a table quickly. I did notice a lot of Asian families dining in near my table which is probably a good sign. As for the Dim Sum I decided on getting the Har Gow, Shu Mai, and the sticky rice. Out of the three that I tried the sticky rice was my favorite, although even then I have had much better elsewhere. The Har Gow was just okay I thought and the Shu Mai was not very good, would probably pass on getting that next time.  Overall I would say that Phoenix Palace is an okay spot to get Dim Sum but mainly because there are not too many other options in the area. I did notice that they do takeout for Dim Sum which could be a good idea when I stop by in the area next time. The service here I would say is typical of other Dim Sum restaurants, although I would add that I did feel a bit rushed when dining in.",

The pork buns don't use a traditional bread but the bun they use taste quite sweet. The tripe is good and their other beef intestine dish is a bit salty for my taste but still acceptable. The food is average for dim sum, but it is pretty decent for dim sum in Arizona. The service is not great I had to ask 3 or 4 times for shrimp rolls and the tea refill took a while to arrive. It was pretty slow on business too so there seemed to just be a lack of workers at the time even though we went at around lunch time. I would say Sunday would probably have better service but you would have to wait for a while. I have also had dinner here and they have better quality food as well as service then.",

    "text": "As far as Chinese buffets go, this is one of the best.  However, the downside to that is the price - you'll be paying about $14 per person (plus the cost of sodas if you want them).  If this was $5 cheaper, I would've given them 4 stars.  Regardless, it's a fun place to go to.  One of my favorite things about this place is that they just have an enormous selection of different foods.  They have lots of the standard Chinese buffet foods you would expect, but they also have sushi, a few different kinds of buns and dumplings, and then just random things that I would assume are fairly authentic.  I've had pig ears, chicken feet, and jellyfish here, so if you want to try something new or disturb your squeamish friends, you have a lot of opportunity for that.  Last time I went they didn't have any jellyfish out which was disappointing because honestly, jellyfish is pretty delicious.  If they have it while you're there, try it out.  There are generally a LOT of Asian people at Phoenix Palace Buffet, which to me seems like a good sign that this is at least semi-authentic.  Also, they have a gigantic space in their building and have way, way too much seating, so you shouldn't have to worry about trying to find enough chairs and tables for a large group.  One last thing - don't forget to try the lotus seed paste buns.  They're a semi-sweet dessert bun and they're awesome.",

They've got great selections, and I love being able to head over to their bakery area and snag a couple bun things to go. Service is not so great - but seriously - what do you expect, it's really not unusual for this sort of setup. I would give it 5 stars except that I hate their char-siapao - the bbq bun - this is one of my faves, since I was a little kid and theirs taste blech. I go here often, and stuff my face - awesome food for an awesome price.",

My friend and I had 2 waters and 6 dim sum items. When the bill came, we noticed an item on the bill says \"2 guests: $1.70\". When we asked the server why, she replied \"we charge money for water.\"  This restaurant CHARGES $0.85 for every water they give out to customer! This is not bottle water, simply water from the tap in a plastic cup. For this reason, I will NOT return to this place, there are plenty other dim sum places in town will gladly provide free water to customers, like any other restaurant in AZ.",

The individual dim sum that we tried....like 6 different ones...I would have to say, were tasty, nicely wrapped and steamed.  We are picky! and we are anxious to go back on a Saturday as they have even more options.  Yes, we would drive 15 miles to go back there, it was that good!",

Also go in a large group so that the bill is less for everyone. I have been here a few times on Sunday mornings around 10 am and never have to worry about waiting for a table. They have a decent selection of dim sum dished. My usual's are the \"footballs\", the Hau gau, and the taro cakes, all of which are decent. If you wait long enough, you might be able to get your hands on the coconut pastries called \"snow balls\" which are very enjoyable. In a hungry group of 4, you can expect to pay $20-25 total as a group and not want to eat anything for the next 6-12 hours.",

Despite getting here late, we still made it out of here in time to celebrate on our own.  We then returned for dim sum and were not disappointed. We had to wait a bit because we arrived late, but it was worth it.  The food was fresh and hot - and they had these desserts (snowballs or something) that we haven't found anywhere else.

After stopping by the Lee Lee supermarket next door (uber Asian!) my parents and I wandered into this place, unsure of what it would hold... and lo and behold! Dim sum? Cantonese speaking servers?   I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic this place was, with the push-around carts and the loud boss running around poking fun at his employees. Everything about this place made me feel like I was back home in NY eating in Chinatown...   CONS: I got a little stomach ache from the 'lo mai gai' or rice wrapped in lotus leaf and unfortunately suffered from that for the rest of the day. I also think the seafood could have been fresher... Also, not too many choices but then again, if there's only a few authentic Chinese restaurants in the area, I won't complain if it's the run-of-the-mill dishes...  PROS: The 'dan tat' or egg tart is pretty good, though I do prefer my crust to be a little more moist.",

A handful of dishes, and they seemed quite unwilling to prepare anything they didn't have already in the cart. The items I did try were quite lacking in quality and flavor...although they did seem to be somewhat fresh (to their credit).

And they don't just make the rounds once and disappear, they keep coming until you either explode or summon the willpower to say no.  I always eat too much at these places.  I can't say no to bbq pork buns, or bbq duck (they have these hanging in the front window for sale at reasonable prices if you're feeling the need.  I'm the only duck commander at my house so I usually have to pass, but they'll do 1/4 to the whole thing.  I'll be back).  I ate until I physically couldn't any more.  Everything from dumplings to shrimp toast to green beans to chicken feet-- if there's something you want, they have it on one of these carts rolling around.  And if you don't know what something is, they're happy to tell you.  This is super helpful if you're new to dim sum, or even if you've had it before but spot something new to try.  I just wish they'd cut me off before I need a bucket! Be prepared to wait a bit, but not too long to lose interest and move on.  Be prepared for an awesome meal and good service.  Our tab for two large mammals who ate to the point of misery was under $40, so its reasonably priced.  The only drawback is that they only do dim sum for lunch.  You gotta drag your butt outa bed, but its so worth it!",

I've been here a number of times over the years and have had a delicious experience each time. The key is to get there before 11:00AM so you don't have a long wait. Any time after 11:15AM pretty much guarantees the place will be packed to the brim.  Also, they run out of snowballs after 11:00AM and that is pretty much the most awesome pastry ever. PPB has loads of carts roaming around so you are never without food, and the prices are great. Obviously the bigger your party the lower your bill will be, no matter how much more you order. It's dim sum insanity!   Seriously, who can eat 'regular' chinese food again after a healthy dose of steamed dumplings, soups, chicken feet and light fluffy pastries?

They were still welcoming and stocked with fresh food choices. We tried their sticky rice, bbq pork buns, shrimp dumplings, rice noodles and taro cakes. One bite and we knew this place was legit.   We are sooooo looking forward to when we can go there again. The only downside is that it's a good 30 minute drive to this area so we can't enjoy dim sum on a weekly basis like we used to in SoCal.

When brought to the manager's attention,  he was not even apologetic and looked angry at us! The customers for suggesting that it be cleaned up before our guests arrive.  I think I'm done with the place.... at least for awhile unless some things change.",

    "text": "Who doesn't like Dim Sum? For those who are unfamiliar with Dim Sum; essentially, it is a type of Chinese cuisine in which was modified down from what would only be served to kings and queens as a delicate to something everyone can enjoy. Ideally, it is best to eat this for breakfast and/or brunch.  Anyway, I believe this place serves one of the best Dim Sum in the Phoenix Area.  What better than to have little Asian ladies push around their Dim Sum carts around to your table and serve you food. Anything from steamed to baked; it is as good as it gets. Several of my favorite dishes are: Pork Dumplings, Shrimp Dumplings, Bean Curd (it sounds weird but pretty good for vegetarians), Beef and Shrimp Rice Noodles with soy sauce, Chicken Feet (normally, Americans don't like this but give it a shot), baked goods like custard buns, custard tarts, pineapple custard buns, coconut buns. These are just a few that I've named; there are many more delicious goodies.  Everything must be downed with a cup of warm tea. Mmmm. Yum.  This place is cleaner than most Chinese restaurants and their customer service (even for dinner) is not bad.",

I am fairly certain that guy is actually the owner or co-owner of the restaurant.  He has never been too friendly before, but now he turned rude.    I can understand/tolerate an occasional rough behavior from an underpaid/overloaded employee (incidentally this also happened at Phoenix Palace sometime ago), but for an owner to be rude to his customers is totally unacceptable.  No one should feel being insulted or harassed while patronizing a small business.",

I love that my friends and I can ask the waiters and waitresses in both Mandarin and Cantonese exactly what we'd like. This place is good for the family and great for larger parties!

Good news was mostly Asian, so we felt that indicated some good eats and worth the wait.  But there was very little wait.  They have a great system---despite the numbers, we were seated within 10 minutes.    The dim sum carts came around at the perfect intervals and we hardly passed up a one, so I can't even tell you what-all we had, except it was uniformly hot and good.  The dim sum ladies didn't have a lot of English, but mostly they could explain what the dish(es) were on their carts, and if not---what the heck, right?    It was just so much fun, and we ate and ate and ate and still ended up with a super-reasonable bill.  We will totally plan another road trip to Chandler and Phoenix Palace---and it's the perfect opportunity to stop in at Lee-Lee's International Market to pick up some exotic stuff for the pantry!",

The clams, seasoned asparagus, ha gao or shumai, fried chicken, chicken feet are all items that I order.  My favorite is the ha gao, I can eat about two orders of it. For those who don't know it's a pork dumpling and shumai is a shrimp dumpling. Both are my top two choices!   Hot tea always goes well with the meal, as well. It can get busy here on the weekends so plan to come early, if you have a bigger party then most likely if you have to wait. If it's just 2 people you'll get seated faster.",

The food wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worse I've had - pretty decent for Arizona. Pricing wasn't bad either; it was a total of $37 including tips and tax for two people. We had the marinated chicken feet (tasty and steamed well), Siu mai, ha gao, steamed pork ribs, and a few other dishes. We had around a total of 11 dishes, which isn't bad for the price. They also have a to-go area for you to order and pick-up. Lots of parking in the plaza as well. Service was friendly to me, but I spoke mostly in Chinese when ordering so it helped. Will return for our dim sum fixes :)",

This is your typical Chinese style serving where some of the servers have limited English, 3 servers asking for orders at once; random staff pulling empty places or checking for empty place off your table.  We didn't have a tea refill so can't say if its the usual lift up the teapot lid and they'll swing by to pick it up and return with a full pot.  Because of the limited English, it may take a little longer to understand what they have on the carts, some of them do rattle off the dishes pretty quick.  Pointing at a dish is acceptable or just say the dish name and they'll tell you if its on their cart or not.  I and the family went there recently as a change from our usual dim sum place, our usual haunt has become boring because the kitchen isn't introducing new dishes and I'm greatly pleased that they have expanded their menu!  They had the usual turnip cake, sui mai, har gow, egg tart, sweet beef/shrimp rice noodles, lotus wrapped sticky rice, spicy shrimp, fried pot stickers, etc.  What set this place apart was that they had shrimp stuffed tofu, garlic chive and shrimp dumplings, soy milk, shanghai dumplings (3 orders!), a cream based bun, little mini fruit tarts .

Having never been here, I declined so I could see the menu.   After five minutes, I'm glad for my decision. The lady offered neighboring tables the same. Her English was so bad that they were utterly confused about what they ordered.   I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and an iced tea for $12.50.   I added beef chow mein from another cart lady.   The flavors of the chow mein were very good, with minimal oil but even less beef. In fact, there was no meat.   The Kung Pao Chicken, which is a spicy dish, had zero spice aside from the dried peppers that were added at the end.   My lunch came with a vegetable roll and steamed Gyoza, which were nice touches.

The carts are a little slow going around so pace yourself if you want to try everything. There was a cart for baked items, steamed items, congee, tripe, noodles, and then occasionally some random guy just carrying a tray of vegetables. The best things I tried were the baked bbq pork buns and baked custard buns. An honorable mention were the footballs and the cream puffs. The cream puffs were pretty standard but they make them in the shape of swans!!",

We ordered a Mandarin dinner with 8 plates. The apps were decent... usual egg roll and crab puffs. The wonton soup was very bland. Moo shuu was probably the most delicious thing they served. The kung pao chicken, moo goo gai pan, beef with broccoli and shrimp dish gets a decent pass. The squid was also kind of lacking. There was a spicy pork dish and a dish I can't remember the name of that tasted pretty good. Overall, the entire meal didn't disappoint.   And the service was nice as they kept filling out tea, water and rice. And then packed out to go boxes and everything. When it comes to Chinese restaurants, I'm usually harsh but this place did just enough things right to get the four stars.",

It was pretty dead when we got here around 5 on Saturday, but more people came in as we finished up our meal.  There are 2 menus. The fancy looking gold menu seems to have strictly traditional style Chinese dishes, while the regular looking menu has a mix of traditional and Americanized dishes. We ordered from both menus and decided on the sizzling rice soup, lotus root with baby bamboo, fresh steamed fish, and walnut shrimp. All were delicious and well presented. Flavors were well balanced, and very beautiful looking. Some minor issues were that some of the bamboo was tough tasting, so it wasn't really baby bamboo, and the walnut shrimp had slightly too much mayo/creamy sauce on it. The star of our meal was the fresh steamed fish. Our waiter informed us it was very fresh (Probably brought in very recently), probably one of the largest tilapia I've seen! The meat was very flavorful and tender and the soy sauce based sauce went with it perfectly.  Service was decent and the young gentleman server was very friendly and spoke fluent English and Cantonese.   Prices are a little higher than your usual sit down traditional Chinese restaurant but it's worth it.",

There was nothing special or all that memorable about any of the dishes that we tried. I always like the pork buns which was good here too. It was fluffy and the pork was sweet. The tofu with simple syrup was good, but I felt like it was too gingery for my taste. My sister said she loved it because of the ginger taste, but I wasn't a fan. They also had seaweed salad which was a first for me. I've never seen seaweed salad at a dim sum place, so I was happy. However, they gave us a lot and we couldn't finish it. All in all a good dim sum spot if you are craving it!",

I grew up in SoCal near Monterey Park and Hacienda Heights and I definitely need a dim sum fix a few times a year. The offerings are at Phoenix Palace are surprisingly similar to those of CA dim sum restaurants. Chicken feet, porridge, crispy taro puffs, egg tarts, spare ribs, steamed stuffed rice noodles, bbq pork buns, etc are all offered via push carts. The quality is pretty decent, the wait staff speak cantonese and its generally an authentic experience.  I prefer Phoenix Palace as opposed to the other large restaurant across the street also offering dim sum. The food is fresher (perhaps due to larger turnover). It certainly gets busy on the weekends and the general rule of dim sum dining is to arrive before noon.",

It was nice because sometimes dim sum places can be slow and you have to wait for your favorite dim sum.  We tried the ha gao (shrimp dumpling) & they had diff types of cheung fun (rice noodle sheet) they were soft and chewy.  I liked the dou Jiang or soymilk which comes in a large cup was only $2.  We ordered the fried pork dumpling and sticky rice which Were nice and piping hot.   The only let down was the turnip cake that fell apart when you eat it and some parts were too dry. Definitely come with a group they have large round tables that could easily fit 10 & you can try lots of variety of dishes. They also have a to-go deli where you can order BBQ pork,  their dim sum, and roast duck at affordable prices.  Next time we're near Lee Lee's plaza we will have to check them out again!",

    "text": "I'm not going to talk about the food because 1. There are other more egregious errors at play here and 2. It's a dimsum place in Arizona; the food is gonna be like any other dimsum place that's not in CA/NY, with the same preprepared frozen dimsum items that every other dimsum place carries.. It's as decent but it's what you'd expect.   Halfway through our meal, my dad sees a friend of his (another Chinese man) arguing with the man at the podium taking numbers for customers just arriving, as dimsum here is always extremely packed since they are one of the only places left in Tempe/Phoenix. The friend comes over to explain that he had just eaten there, and as he was leaving he saw the manager/podium guy turn away a black family. Not only did he refuse to serve them initially, when they asked why the podium guy just started physically pushing them out! When this friend asked why, the man blew it off and just said he \"did not want to serve them.\" My dad, and the rest of our family, was outraged just as this family friend was, and so the friend went back to the podium guy to complain, saying \"you can't just not serve that family for no reason!\" Upon hearing that the podium guy turns to our family friend and curtly states \"you can leave too\" and begins to push him out of the restaurant too. The friend starts yelling \"I just ate here!\" Such unbelievably atrocious service and racism at what I used to think of as a half decent dimsum place in Tempe.  We quickly wrapped up our meal after witnessing this all go down, and the podium man comes over to quickly start taking our empty plates/dishes away. As he tries to stack too many plates he can handle in an attempt to clear the whole table, he ends up spilling my moms tea, nearly all over her. Then he just up and left without apologizing.  I have attached a photo of this man to my review. His face is slightly blurry but you'll know him if you see him. He is a racist, with no decency for treating his customers with any respect. I strongly suggest Phoenix Palace fire this idiot before they risk this bad press getting out and losing customers. Absolutely ridiculous.",

Good for large or small parties and you can generally sit 10 per table.  Keep in mind the portions are like tapas so you may tend to over order as it looks like you really didn't order much but it is very filling.

We came a couple weekends ago and waited about 30 minutes for a table but the food was very good and fresh. We stopped in this morning again and got seated right away. Unfortunately, this time the food was not fresh, which is a huge no-no for dim sum. The dumpling wrappers were chewy and we got completely cold shrimp egg rolls (which are very delicious when they are hot & crispy!).   Unfortunately our dim sum options in AZ are very limited, so I keep coming back hoping I'd catch them on a good day. Next time, if there is no wait, I will go elsewhere.

    "text": "Sooo . . . I've been coming on and off to this place since it first opened and it has gone through several incarnations from buffet to sit down to something in betwn that I really wasn't sure what was being served when I opened their door this past Sat.  Much to my pleasant surprise, the place was bustling serving dim sum a plenty. And the place was packed with my kind of people (Chinese in case you're wondering. Haha) so I figured the dim sum must be pretty good.  I was not disappointed. Everything I had was up to standard. I had 5 dishes plus got charged 65 cents for having water and the tea that was not served to me.  When I questioned the 65 cents and told the owner I did not have tea, he pointed to a handwritten sign taped to the cash register hidden behind stacks of to go menus that said 65 cents charged to every customer for tea AND WATER. Okay, I didn't realize when I crossed the threshold I had been transported to China or Europe where they do charge for water.  I also questioned an item where they charged me for a large item when I only had the small dishes and boy, did the owner insist on every penny!  Okay, dude I won't argue with you. So somehow for five dishes, water, and tea that I didn't get the bill came to a whopping $17 which I thought was freakin' expensive for dim sum at lunch time. When I saw the bill I almost wish I could have thrown up the food and return the dishes back to them. Alas, I couldn't and didn't so I paid my bill and left.  Sigh, since dim sum has become trendy and popular I think it's driven up the price!  I remember when I could have 5 dishes for less than $10!  Oh, the good 'ole days!",

It sucks if you sit in a corner and all the food is either gone or cold by the time the ladies get to your table. I'll take my ticket to a cart across the room if we've been waiting too long. There are too many dishes to go over, but the congee here is excellent. The only dish that fell short was the har gow - skin too thick and shrimp was mushy and falling apart.  We ate a lot and our tab was about $11/pp. My current dim sum order of preference of distance wasn't a factor: phoenix palace, great wall, china king, mekong.",

And Dottsy has pictures too!  And wow did I get off cheap!    The best dim sum I have ever had!  Honestly, the only dim sum I have ever had!  I'm so glad I had other yelpers that were experienced to share it with and help me enjoy the first time!  Seriously, Phoenix Palace has really good dim sum.  I enjoyed nearly everything I tried, there was tremendous variety and high quality through and through.  I was not quite as adventurous as some of the more experienced folks at the table.  I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasn't ready to go all the way.  The review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.  I don't know but it was good.  For 6 people and loads of food the total was just under $70.  Unreal.  Great lunch spot for dim sumderful variety and a total bargain.  Phoenix Palace is in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so you can fill up on dim sum before you do your shopping.  Then you'll spend less when you go shopping.  Never go shopping hungry.",

    "text": "When I hear the words dim sum my ears perk up much like a dog when he hears someone approaching. Then a certain caution sweeps over me since so many dim sum places around the valley don't even come close to those found in other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. So when a friend of mine and local ice cream guru, Helen Yung from Sweet Republic, told me about a new dim sum joint that reminded her of Hong Kong, I was elated to try it as soon as possible.  Phoenix Palace is quickly becoming a jack of all trades sort of restaurant. During the week they have seafood and Chinese buffets, a full menu with free delivery, and on the weekends rolling cart dim sum as well as a take out BBQ section. While carts only roll on the weekends, dim sum can be ordered any day of the week off of a smaller menu. We came just for the weekend cart dim sum, the BBQ section in the front of the restaurant looked amazing. In the window wrapped onto stainless steels hooks were selections of whole roasted duck, pork spare ribs and roasted chicken. I haven't seen a display like this one since being in Chinatown in San Francisco a few months back, very impressive. Come early or call ahead if you want to enjoy a roast duck to-go, when we left the display was pretty much wiped out.  Walking into the Phoenix Palace you'll immediately notice that you're not in Kansas anymore, the clientele is mostly Asian who have very discerning palates. You know you're in the right place when the target market is ethnic and not American. No worries about communication break down, the staff speaks English, even if it is a little broken. Though all you really need are your senses to guide you through the dim sum experience. After being sat, the carts will start rolling by your table to peddle their vast variety of dumplings. Each cart person will open a steam basket for you to take a look inside and along with a brief explanation, usually consisting of only one word, they stamp your tally card and move on. The carts don't come in any sort of order so just have fun and order away. If something looks even remotely good go ahead, it's really inexpensive.  One of the main difference between Phoenix Palace and the other dim sum restaurants, is the fact that not only do they offer 75+ different items, but here it's not only fresh but made in house. One of the carts that come about is a fry cart which at first seemed unusual. It's a stainless steel ride with a built in cook top where some items are crisped and heated table side which made perfect sense after one bite. In all of the places I've had dim sum, here and in other cities, I have never seen or heard of this before. Helen told me that she hadn't seen something like that since having dim sum in Hong Kong. If Helen is impressed, I'm blown away! We started with an order of Green Leek Gow ($3.15), with a translucent skin showing a silhouette of diced leeks and chopped shrimp, then crisped up on either side for a textural symphony. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Bun ($3.15) which had a slightly crisped edges filled with tender chopped pork, each bite was simply sublime. These were so good we ordered an additional plate of those chubby meat filled pillows.  The standards are done extremely well here, such as the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($2.15), as well as the baked version ($2.15) with its covering of sweet sticky glaze. If you've never experienced a BBQ Pork Bun in either incarnation, you really should. This is the all about savory, salty and sweet, dip in some chili paste for an added spicy dimension. Chinese Broccoli ($5.25) is slightly bitter, slightly sweet and has a crunchiness that pairs well with the softer noodle dishes like the Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($3.15). Long sheets of rice noodles are filled with sliced tender beef, rolled and then steamed. When delivered to your table, a lightly sweetened soy sauce is poured over the top. Shui Mai ($2.15) is as tender and flavorful as it was meant to be, porky and delicious.  Dessert dim sum is as much fun as its savory counterpart. Sesame Balls ($2.15) filled with sweetened red bean paste, surrounded by sticky rice, then rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried were pretty much a crowd pleaser. The Snow Bun ($2.15) was a new one that I've never seen or tasted before. A cloud of pure heaven filled with creamy custard, served warm, blew away any doughnut that's graced my lips. I also ordered a box of them to-go so they could be enjoyed again later. The tall and billowy Brown Sugar Rice Cake ($2.15) reminded me more of a yellow cake though was very good, hot and fresh out of the steam basket.  There aren't too many places where you can try so many different textures and flavor in one sitting. So it really is an experience to have dim sum with a close group of pals because food always seems to bring us just a little bit closer.",

Not very impressive, though the chicken feet was quite good, jalapeno in the marinating sauce !?.   The redeeming dish was the desert tray which came out fresh and hot.

I would love to come back and have a larger group... that seems like a lot of fun and a good way to try lots of food!    I do want to try the chicken feet.  The sauce looked really good!

Well that was then this is now...  On a very hungry late evening a fellow yelper Clifford and I were gonna meet up for some Chinese food. We were headed to our favorite spot on the east side. When I got there it was 5 min from closing and Clifford was still 15 min away. After discussing some options I made it down to Dobson and Warner to find Phoenix Palace open till 10. After giving Clifford a ring we met up there and gave it a shot.   Upon entering I noticed that the place was empty, but not common on a monday night and with all the other places in the area closing early the complex is usually dead by 9. The place no longer having any buffet tables and many of the awful decor gone it could be promising.   Seeing that their menu had some of my favorite dishes I thought I give it a shot. So some Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, Salted Fish Fried Rice and Beef Stew Hotpot.   Wow! Were we surprised with the food, especially this late at night. The pork chops were well seasoned to how they should be and very crispy on outside and juicy on the inside. The beef stew was wonderful, the meat was well cooked and the large pieces of the green onion was a great touch of flavor. The salted fish fried rice was not so great, it was very under seasoned and the portions for the fish and chicken were not a large as some places are with this dish.   On my second visit I tried a different fried rice dish and same thing very under seasoned. It seems like that the chef has very strong dishes and some other dishes are not so strong. I have yet to try the dim sum but i'm sure this is going to be very good as well.",

    "text": "Best Dim Sum In Town!!  I like the wide selections of dim sum they have. You can also tell they made most the dim sums freshly, not those bought frozen type of deal like some other places.   Sometimes, I would be surprised with new products/ unusual products they are serving. Last time I was there, I was offered \"thousand years old egg cake\". But, if you keep open mind, this is the best place for you to sample many different type of dishes affordably. .   Can't wait to bring some new friends there for some Dim Sum this weekend!",

    "text": "Once one of my colleagues learned that I had never tried Dim Sum, they immediately dragged me to this place for lunch.  While it is a buffet, I was informed that they block up a part of the seating for Dim Sum at lunchtime.  Well it turns out that Dim Sum (for those of you who don't know, such as myself) is best experienced in a group, and they have servers bring out carts with plates of different items and ask if you want some.  Whether it be sticky pork bbq rolls (Very good) or some sort of beef rice noodle, there is about 4 portions per plate.  They set them on the table and everyone dug in.  Now I'm not the most picky eater, in fact I like to think of myself as somewhat adventurous, but when my colleague asked for the chicken feet I was somewhat taken aback.  Almost felt like a \"survivor\" competition... but I just couldn't get myself to eat it.  Those who did claimed it was really good... so I let them finish them off.  Everyone I was with really loved the food, and I really liked what I did try, so I'm going to give this place 5 stars for its authenticity and food.  I would comment on the price, but I didn't pay, so I'm not too sure on that end.   There seems to be a lot of different options of this place, but I can only tell what I experienced.  They do have a large \"under new management\" banner out front, so maybe that explains the bad reviews in the past.",

    "text": "We shop at Lee Lees all the time (in the same shopping center), and we had eaten at Phoenix Palace back when it was a buffet, but it was only recently that we realized that they now serve dim sum everyday.   So today we rushed over there to check it out. The wife, while born and raised in the Philippines, is of Chinese descent and grew up around this stuff. When you consider that, along with the fact that our first date was ten days together in Hong Kong (dim sum heaven), you can see that the bar is pretty high for us when it comes to dim sum. Now, we know we cannot expect Hong Kong or even San Francisco quality in Phoenix necessarily. Still, the food at Phoenix Palace was quite good overall. We were not disappointed.   We had two types of shu mai, along with har gow, jellyfish, barbecue pork buns, sesame balls, pot stickers, and spring rolls. We missed the chicken feet, which is one of Carol's favorites, but we'll get to that next time. All was great, but the har gow especially stood out. It was a quite different flavor than what we have had at Golden Buddha, C-Fu or any of the other local places. Everything was yummy though.   The service, on the other hand, was mixed. It started out nice, with a friendly greeting by the guy that seated us. But it went downhill from there. Its not that they were rude or unfriendly. It was more like benign neglect. The carts came around quickly enough, but once we had the food we did not see anyone again until it was time to settle the bill. No refills, in other words. That said, at least the glasses were large and we had a pot of hot tea, so it was not the end of the world. Another gripe--no chile oil. I  think I'll bring my own next time. Or maybe we just caught them on a bad day.  The food was a four or a five by local standards, while the service was a two or a three. Since I can't give 3.5 stars I'll go with four. It's really nice to see a growing number of decent dim sum restaurants in town. Hopefully this is a trend that will continue.   By the way, they have a take out counter also, as well as a regular menu. We'll check that out sometime in the future and report back.",

I'm so spoiled now after ordering from them that I cannot order from any other. Phoenix Palace gives you plentiful portions so be sure you are hungry!   My in-laws were in town not too long ago and they always NEED chinese food. We introduced them to Phoenix Palace and they were sold on the first bite! They made three meals out of one order because there was that much food!!!  In all honesty, we've only ordered out so we are not sure about the dine in experience. Over the phone and in person they are very friendly so I don't see dine in being a problem.   Seriously, you gotta try this place!",

The place looks small from the outside but its a good size dim sum place. The service was fast and good...they came around the carts frequently. We mostly had the shrimp stuff and it was EXCELLENT! Great find and cheap...we both had a good amount until we were full and the bill came to $16!!!",

Not because of way they might taste, but i don't know what part of the foot to eat!  We'll i ask some of my coworkers who have tried it and filled me in on how to eat those suckers! I love this place because they have a good amount of dim sum dishes you can try.  I usually go for the gai lan (chinese broccoli w/ oyster sauce) and the chow mein, which they give a very small portion.  But all things i have tried are great.  Other dim sum places are great but i tend to order alot of things that it's kinda pricey after picking too much stuff.  The reason i like this place is it's a little cheaper then the others places nearby.  And the staff a very friendly on letting you know what the dim sum varieties are.  Great Place!",

Had to wait about 4 mins to be acknowledged and seated.  Another 5-7 mins before someone takes the order for Hot Tea.... Then the order was taken, 3 entrees and 1 Assorted Won Ton Soup aka Wor Won Ton Tong.  When the soup was delivered, almost 20 mins later... excuse from Server was, \"the kitchen lost the ticket\".  Ok... soup looks good but 5 mins later... the 3 entrees were delivered.  Now that is not good since I was still on my 1st bowl of soup.  That's not good because by the time I am finished with the soup, the other food was getting cold... no longer hot out of the kitchen.  Had 2 ask twice in a 20 min time frame for plain old water for my friend.  And this time was requested in English.  The server was very distracted...Chinese woman obviously was not \"with the program\".  She was quick to deliver the check and asked to pack the leftovers while we were still eating.  I speak fluent Cantonese being HK born so language was not a barrier.  I tipped only 10% for this poor service.  I was invited back for Dim Sum... Not sure I will be in a hurry for that.  Dim Sum is no fun room temperature.",

Lucky though, we got there when they had just opened and since they have private rooms for large gatherings, it seemed like we had the whole place (or room) to ourselves.  We had several traditional Chinese dishes, but from the aromas and the crowds, I'm guessing the Dim Sum was really good.  The family style dish portions were good and the food was fresh and tasty.  However, I do wish they used just a little less sesame oil to cook the dishes, which were on the oily side.  Parking was okay, but the shopping center gets packed fast on the weekends.  Restrooms were very clean too (a plus at Asian restaurants).",

    "text": "What a difference from the other location on Ray Rd...The place is rundown and the service was AWFUL.    We were at the restaurant over the weekend for dinner.  The restaurant was less than half full with mostly Chinese people.  So we thought this could be promising.  When we sat down, the lady gave us the Chinese menu which is understandable...you know, b/c we are Asian.  But everything on the menu was just too authentic like duck's feet or pig's intestines and so we were just sitting there thinking...what should we do....Then we overheard the people sitting behind us ordering Orange Chicken, Kang Pao beef, etc.  When their waiter was about to pass us, we asked for the menu he was carrying and there you go, it was the English menu we are totally used to...whew.    So we ordered the soup, friend rice, and seafood dish.  The wait for our food was around 40min or so...just sitting there waiting, starving.....In the mean time, the glowing fast food drive through menu was calling us from across the street through the window...that was not fun.  When we finally got our food, we asked for steamed rice....it NEVER came.  At that point, we were done.  We just sat there ate what was available and left.    So why 3 stars? Because the food was pretty good.  *Food = everything was pretty good.  IF you are not used to the authentic Chinese food, be sure to ASK for the English menu or you will waste your time. *Service = HORRIBLE.  If you are hungry and ready to eat dinner, go somewhere else *Location = it is in the same complex as Lee Lee's Market so it is convenient I guess. *Decor = horrid",

You can also take out the Dim Sum, which we usually do when there is crowd. This place used to be empty when they started few years ago. Now the word of mouth brought them so many customers. You will have to wait in you come after 11:30AM. A friend of mine come down there every week from fountain hills to meet with us.   The staff is very nice and friendly. They also have a quiet room for reservation if you have party of 10 more. If you are shopping at Lee Lee supermarket, you don't want to miss this Dim Sum place.",
