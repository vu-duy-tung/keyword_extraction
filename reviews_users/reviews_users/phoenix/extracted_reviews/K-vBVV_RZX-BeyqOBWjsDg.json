Her behavior suggested we were an inconvenience to her. Perhaps she had a bad night (happens to the best/worst  of us), perhaps she had plans and got stuck closing the shop . . . Should we have to wonder or should we be able to go out to eat and relax after work without an attitude from the staff? It's burger and fries people . . . a smile or just being pleasant is all we ask.  That said, the food was great as usual and there was one person (maybe the cook) who we encountered (1 of 4) who had a good attitude!!!!",

    "text": "This is kind of the 'go-to' spot at work when I have lunch with the guys. Went there for lunch yesterday and decided to try something other than the turkey club sandwich or BLT (which are my general faves on the menu) so I tried the Monaco Foccacia.   Well, ok, so the meal was tasty enough, although, correct me if I'm wrong (yeah, it's happened once or twice) but my Monaco Foccacia was served in a flour tortilla. I'm not sure if the term focaccia has been altered to mean burrito, but it was not what I was expecting. However, I have no problem with tortillas so didn't make a fuss.   The \"sandwich?\" was tasty (but I didn't like the sweet jalapeno dipping sauce that came along with it...ick!) and I had the 1/2 and 1/2 fry/onion rings along with it. I was doing well until I bit into a particularly greasy fry and that pretty much ended it for me. I'm not a fry snob, in fact, it's a rare occasion when I have the urge for a fried potato sliver, but once I get a mouthful of grease, it's game over. Up until that point, I enjoyed the meal and I'm sure we'll be back, but next time I know that if I order a sandwich, I may need to remind them that I mean a sandwich on bread...  My friend order the fried chicken salad and said he really enjoyed it.  In the past I have had their wings and they are REALLLLLLLY yummy.",

    "text": "If there was zero stars I'd have selected it. I've been going to this Zipps (and others), plus Goodies for almost 20 years. Besides the fact that the waitress did not want to be serving for a living, and therefore the services was barely adequate, I learned a couple of things about drinking a beer there.    Firstly, if you get a 32 ounce beer (like at happy hour) you have to drink it in the 32 oz glass it comes in, and cannot transfer it to a 16 oz glass, say, to be a little more civilized or perhaps to have a cold glass, for example.  Apparently, that represents an unacceptable risk to the establishment, such as, perhaps, maybe, in my case, I'd share said beer with my teenage daughters, or if I was at the bar I'd split my discounted happy-hour 32 oz beer with my drinking buddies, maybe 4 oz each and we'd skip out happily having only spent $3 on a beer, and not fork out three dollars each to have a whole 32 oz each. Perhaps it's just me, and I should lower my social standards (it is Zipps after all), or pump some  more iron, and put some meat on my toothpick-like arm before I audaciously order another 32 oz at Zipps. Perhaps, perhaps not, but we'll never know, because it will never happen again.  Secondly, if you do try to 'beat the system', or 'stick it to the man' , like, for example, poring 16 oz in your plastic water glass (significantly more suited to my toothpick-like arms), you'll also be told the we 'cannot have beer in a plastic glass'. Who knew? Fouls up the dishwasher? Food police will write you up and you'll show up on Dirty Dining? Who knows. But, and here is the bonus for you endurance readers: they'll bring you a cold glass for the beer in the plastic cup! Jackpot! Mission accomplished.  Sadly, I'd normally just go to Goodies as an alternative, but that would add to Old Man Goldman's coffers, as he is the 'man', and I just won't do that any more.  Gladly, the Village Inn is on my way home, and I am currently happily enjoying their Happy Hour in a very civilized atmosphere, sipping casually on an excellent IPA in a very manageable, cold, lightweight glass.  Cheers! Here's to social media, and the power of alternatives!!",

The bus makes multiple trips between Zipp's and Salt River fields for all Spring Training games before and after so you can avoid parking fees and sitting in traffic on the way out of the game. Sure you spend your parking fee and then some on booze and food, but we still had a good time.  The food was decent, we ordered some chicken nachos and later on their chicken \"skewers\", which we basically chicken strips on a stick.  Our server was attentive as our beers stayed cold and some pregame shots were consumed.  If I lived closer by this would be a regular spot for me for sure.",

Typical sports bar place, tons of tvs, full bar and many men unloading after a long day of work. It was clean and the booth we sat in were comfy...  Now about the food. I had the regular 'Hot' wings, at this place, and I will sadly say that the mild wings at Hooters we're way better an those were boneless...Normally, when you leave the meat on the bone its suppose to keep the meats moist and juicy and this totally was not the case for these wings, they tried and failed, but they were no doubt Hot, it burnt my lips and my tongue to the point of just giving up on them entirely.  My friend had a burger, which he enjoyed, but didn't care too much for the fries, which to me, weren't terrible, but they needed more umph for me to be considered good fries. I think about the only thing that I was stoked about was the dirty martini I ordered, it wasn't bad but it wasn't something that would keep me coming back for more.  So yea, good service and waitresses we're nice! But 3 stars because, I wasn't wowed, everything was just so-so.",

Now I know this is Arizona, but it gets pretty chilly outside in the winter especially when the area is shaded. Fifteen of my friends left and went elsewhere because it was too cold outside. Dollars out the door if you ask me.

    "text": "Had the Swiss mushroom burger.  All of their 'specialty' burgers are double patties so the portion was good.  The cook's version of medium was unfortunately well-done, and I prefer rare, but understand that many places are uncomfortable cooking ground beef rare- hey they know where they get their supplies and sure don't.  They offer fries, sweet potato chips and onion rings which you can get as half and half, so we tried the chips and rings.  Excellent onion rings.  The chips were a little burned.  Eileen got a couple of pizza slices, but they are pretty big and she couldn't even finish one, so they went into a box.  The pizza was basic bar pizza fare, nothing special, but did come with shredded Parmesan on it. Jenna R was an attentive and friendly server- thanks Jenna!",

We started with the golden wings that were good, but not great. I ordered a focaccia with balsamic sirloin, mushroom, onion, and cheese. Sounded good, but it just tasted like balsamic grease. I also went with half sweet potato chips and fries. The fries has no seasoning and needed to be cooked a couple more minutes to make them a little crispy. The sweet potato chips were ok, but again no salt and pepper. My fiance ordered the onion rings, and of course there was not a single grain of salt on those onion rings. The food was disappointing to say the least.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I don't understand how anyone can run a kitchen and let all of the food leave your kitchen without salt. I wouldn't come here for the food after this experience, but would consider having a couple beers here.",

Service is key since this is a sports bar and I value the flexibility of the staff to please everyone in the restaurant with respect to which game they want to watch and on which television. In addition to quality wait staff, one thing I particularly like is that I can see the management out on the floor, which means they are very in tune with the pace of business. I see them often bringing out orders.   I typically have the Jalapeno Burger off of the specialty burger menu which is a delicious juicy double stack with fresh Jalapenos on top. I also typically schedule a longer run next morning.   If I'm in the area, I always aim for this Zipps and will continue to recommend it for all those in the Talking Stick area!",

You cannot beat their daily happy hour and reverse happy hour deals. Best wings (recommend \"golden medium\") in town and I'm a huge fan of their focaccias (recommend the \"pepper jack\" or \"monaco\"). I wish the fries would be cooked a bit longer but you have to appreciate that they are freshly hand cut. I also used to always get their \"it's not easy being this cheesy\" burger (no longer in the menu but they'll still cook it). Also a big fan of both of their chilis. I always leave Zipps satisfied",

From my sons 21st birthday to my youngest sons college acceptance dinner.  Last night, I had a couple of friends who had never been here and we were having a great night till we came in. We were greeted perfectly and sat. 2 servers approached our table, only 1 introduced herself as Heather. Strike 1. We place our order. Strike 2 came as we had to wait longer than normal for our food. It was not busy, mind you. We finally got our food and as normal, it was delish. My friend ran out of ranch and I had to askthe 2 servers for ranch and my other friend asked for a take home box. They brought that right away but we sat for 15 minutes waiting for the extra dressing. Finally after we sat watching the 2 servers jack around and start taking order on a new table, my friend got up and went over to them. Then we got attitude from Heather. I was soooo embarrassed because the service was horrible and I talked this place up. I have never in my life not tipped someone till tonight  I have worked in the service industry since 1988 and I KNOW how important tips are.  So please hear me on this, PLEASE EDUCATE your servers on customer service, dealing with the customer in a professional manner ( even if the customer is being difficult).   Signed, A long time customer you just lost",

The waitress apologized and brought me what I thought was my house wine.  Long story short, check comes with three full priced wines and an extra $6 charge.  After bringing this to her attention the manager comes to offer coupons for next visit.  \"I don't want coupons for a place I will not be returning to\"!  Manager took ONE dollar off the bill and basically told me to get out.  Absolutely appalled! If you want a great sports bar in that same area go to Tavern Grill! The service and food there is always GREAT!",

They had their misters running full blast and since it was cool the result was akin to \"rain.\"  We asked for the misters to be turned off but the manager refused stating it is now \"Corporate Policy\" to run the misters night and day regardless of the weather.  This is the dumbest thing I've heard in quite a while.  There wasn't a single, solitary person on that patio...on a beautiful night during spring training. Don't go there expecting a nice patio experience unless it is very hot and not at all humid.",

    "text": "I'm ashamed to admit that this was my first time in a Zipps...especially given it's close proximity to my house. Now that I've been, I know with absolute certainty that it won't be long before I go back.  Our visit took place on a Saturday night, with some pretty big time college games on the docket. Somehow, we managed to get front row parking. Though, if we weren't able to land such primo parking, I'm not sure how far we would have had to venture before we found a spot. The lot immediately in front of the restaurant is VERY small...probably no more than 25 cars small.   Not knowing exactly what to expect when we walked in, we were greeted with an absolute explosion of sound. It's strange...from the outside, you couldn't tell how loud the sound system would be...so, kudos the the sound dampening AND the acoustics.   As we were seated, I took a look around. We passed a shuffleboard table <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#31oNdkKqDaB1eXMcdAfQIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/zipp...</a>, directly across from a full bar. In the back, there are banks of booths for seating, all surrounding a nice-sized billiards table. At the end of the bar, there was the token \"feed me money while you drink\" bar games machine. I haven't played this one, though I have played MANY like it in the past. I'm sure this one will soon taste the fury of my quarters and drunk fingers. Directly behind the video games, they also have an electronic dart board to round out the gamut of pub games <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#EU84a1qFhSVZo8INtRRiSg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/zipp...</a>.  We made it to our booth, where the five of us sat and met Katie, our server (we had the in-laws with us, in case anybody was keeping count). Katie was extremely enthusiastic about her job, making sure to remind us of her name every time she stopped by. I originally thought she was overdoing it, but she's one of very few servers whose name I actually remember. So, hats off to Katie.  While we were ordering our meals, we had access to an absolute bevy of televisions from which to choose to watch the games. I had my back to the bar, and I could see four t.v.s from my seat alone. I'm pretty sure we counted at least a dozen t.v.s total.  I made the pleasant gaffe of asking Katie what the largest size beer they had available. Come to find out, they have 32 oz glasses <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#AcbqTlhTjSLQs2AGnokY_Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/zipp...</a>. Two of them later, I was very glad I wasn't the designated driver...though, I wasn't too bad off to realize how good my meal was.  I can only speak for myself on the meal portion. Looking over their menu, I noticed that they allow you to make your own burger. They also give you the option to choose from beef patties, turkey patties, or ever chicken patties! I asked about the thickness of the patties, as they offer either a single or double burger option. As it turns out, the patties are relatively thin. So, if you're hungry, spring for the double patty...it's only about a dollar more, still coming in at under $9.00 for the whole thing <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#vCWfGZqjbSHoDNbjAt1OIA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/zipp...</a>.  I had two of the behemoth beers, and my wife another. My in-laws each ordered some ridiculously large salads, along with two glasses of Chardonnay. My wife got a MASSIVE club sandwich (seriously...I have no idea where they baked this bread...it was ridiculous). My daughter, of course, got the grilled cheese. The check, after tip, came in under $90.00.   Now that we know about this place, I can absolutely foresee us becoming regulars. Even though it's a restaurant, it has that hometown bar feel to it. An upscale dive bar...if that makes any sense. Whatever the case may be, I recommend it.",

Got a big pizza, some wings and a sandwich with a salad. I saw my food sitting on the line for about 15 min and asked the waitress if it was our wings. She said no and immediately went to the kitchen to remove them from the line. The pizza tasted like elementary school card board pizza, the wings were OK and I didn't taste the sandwich. The ranch is really good though. The waitress didn't even come back once to ask us how everything tasted until we were all done with our food. She came to the table about 3 times through out our stay. I'm also a server in a restaurant and I understand how stressful, and busy things can get. However this girl was just a bad server, and I just had a bad experience overall. I will definitely NOT be coming back to this place.",

Don't sit out here if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke.  In Arizona, people are still allowed to smoke on patios.    I left Zipps with the feeling that days had been taken off my life just from the exposure to second-hand smoke.  I was expecting a lot more, but Zipps was a weak experience...but...it is a sports bar--a very loud one at that.  Food was fresh but it's nothing great.     We had two waitresses..one was in training, so we cut her a little slack for the delay.  I had the BBQ-ranch chopped chicken salad.  Chicken was fresh off the grill and the lettuce was cool and crunchy, but it was so....elementary.  Then again...what can I expect from this type of restaurant?    My parents loved their meal.  But how can you mess up a turkey sandwich, chicken noodle soup and a Greek salad?  I was eager to get home after the meal...after waiting 15 minutes for the bill I was extremely frustrated.   Oh, if you ever feel the urge to go out and get drunk at all Goldie's and Zipp's locations, there is a shuttle available to fulfill your desire.

We arrived at 11:30 for lunch during our lunch hour at work. We were seated right away and had to wait over an hour for our food to arrive after we ordered. When the food did arrive mine was made incorrectly. I ordered fish because it is Friday during Lent and they put a burger in my fish taco because the waitress made a mistake. I had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct food to arrive. When it did arrive, they had the wrong side and instead of just bringing out the correct one, they took my food away to put the correct side on the plate. So gross. No one cared that there was a mistake, a manager didn't come check on the table, the service was horrible. It took 2 hours and 15 minutes for us to get in and out. We will not be returning.",

Our food and drinks were fine even though we had asked for a few things more than once. It took a little over an hour to get our food. Which wasn't even the worst part.   The worst part was when we repeatedly told management, and we weren't the only table who complained, about the screaming kids. These kids were screaming at the top of their lungs for NO REASON. We then move outside because we hadn't finished out drinks and these kids come outside and reeked havoc out on the patio, still no manager or any improvement. The lady with the screaming kids said that it was fine, that kids would be kids and she also told us to chill out. WORSTTT restaurant experience I've ever had. These kids screamed for a good two hours. I finally decided to leave, ZIPPS lost all of my business. I wasn't expecting a 5-start experience but I was wasn't expecting to leave with a migraine.",

Definitely a neighborhood-feel which is refreshing. My hubs, son, and I ordered burgers - the best we've had in years! The meat is seasoned to perfection. We chose the half/half of fries and onion rings which were outta this world. I love the flavor of slightly overdone fries and wasn't disappointed. The onion rings are obviously fresh and hand battered. All that for only a few bucks more than a fast food place - just $10. Highly recommend.",

Price & quality is what get people in your door...THEN they decide if you've won them over or if they can get something similar elsewhere. In AZ, wings are wings. The sauce is better some places, the flavor is better others, the char is spot on or not. ZIPPS wings are GOOD, they are CONSISTENT. ...but they aren't SPECIAL.  They don't demand an $11 for 10 wings (not even a full dozen) price! If you raise the price by $3+...what have I gained by buying it?? If the answer is nothing, it's the same...then I'll order the $2 substandard pizza slice instead. Food is food. If I'm not paying for \"special\" taste/experience, then I'll go for cheap.  Get smarter Zipps owners. You had a great thing and you ruined it out of greed. If your costs on wings go up, lessen your menu and raise cost on less popular items. It's business 101",

They have a killer happy hour special, $6.00 for 10 of their famous wings, or you can get an order of their skewers $3.00 well cocktails, or zipperitas, and $4.00 32oz domestic beers or premium pints!  It's no secret that I am a total wing junkie. I think I may be in need of a support group. If wings are on the menu then wings will be what I order. One would assume that something as simple as Chicken Wings would be hard to screw up. That is not True my friends... Who wants over cooked, over sauced, soggy chicken wings? Not me! The wings were perfectly crispy, deep fried to perfection and the sauce to wing ratio was spot on. And for $6.00 who can complain. The only thing that slightly bothered me was they charged me $0.50 for a side of ranch, I hate when places do that. Other than that, service was adequate, food was good, and for the price you can't beat it. Perfect laid-back  HH evening",

Whenever I visit a Zipps, I know that I will get good sports bar food, a great environment to watch a game, a nice patio to enjoy the pretty weather with friends and a very delicious foccacia sandwich and fries! What more can you ask for?   Their foccacias are amazing. The bread is the perfect size and is soft to the bite. They have several different flavors but my favorite is the Monacco foccacia. The french fries are cooked perfectly and just crispy enough. I also enjoy their wings and most people love either their wings or their foccacias.   One thing that stands out about this location verses the others is that they have a Zipp bus which will transport people to and from Zipps to Salt River Fields for events and games. This is free! It's a great service because you can enjoy good food and a couple drinks and then get a free ride to the event.",

Not dark brown, black. Burnt. Inedible. She sent it back.  10 minutes later, new sandwich came out. This one was slightly less burnt, but still inedible. Tasted sour, almost as if the oil in the fryer was never changed. Manager came out and explained that because the patty is thick, it requires a longer time in the fryer. And also their breading is dark before they cook the patty. I explained that I've had frozen patties that never burn or change color that taste BETTER than this lump of coal they brought out, claiming to be fresh.  The manager only issued a sarcastic apology and took the chicken off the bill. Unless the quality improves,  we won't be eating here anytime soon, which is a shame, because I used to eat here 2-3 times per week.",

We were visiting and met up with some local friends at their suggestion.  Apparently the locals like this place.  There was a good crowd for a week day.  They have plenty of sitting options including an out door patio in addition to a traditional restaurant style seating area and a bar.  The decor is kind of plain, but who cares. My partner had the wings and said they were great.  I had the chicken fingers which were also good.  We split a half and half basket of fries and onion rings.  This is where Zipps excels.  It's pretty cool that they have this half and half options for those of us who love fried potatoes, but want the occasional onion ring.  Both sides were great; crispy not greasy and the portions were large ample enough for sharing. I had a happy hour flavored vodka and after we decifered that grape was not grapefruit we were in business.  Cant beat the price at 4 bucks!  A special shout out to our excellent server Jansen who was cute, personable and all smiles.  Zipps scores high for a nice crowd, friendly server and good food.  If your looking for a drink and typical bar food severed with a smile.  Stop on by soon,  Jansen or one of her happy folleagues will be glad to serve you.",

The manger was in the kitchen cooking, so the server told us sorry we can't change the channel because he can't leave for 4 seconds to change it. That's a huge part of the sports bar experience is to watch the game, now I missed the game. I was completely baffled at the fact that the manager wouldn't even leave for 3 seconds to acknowledge us or care enough about the customers to help out. Literally would take two seconds. Absolutely brutal customer experience. The server was great though. It wasn't her fault and she felt bad. Manager needs to figure it out. It's a sports bar. Care enough about your customers and change the effing channel. Pathetic.",

    "text": "I've lived in the neighborhood for years, but haven't had a Big Zipp burger for awhile.  I decided to remedy that this morning. Here's what happened . . . I phoned in an order for a Big Zipp for carryout just as they opened at 11:00.  It took about 15 minutes.  So far so good. However, when I arrived home, I discovered that my sandwich had no cheese, no pickle, no lettuce, and - worst of all - no special sauce, i.e., it wasn't a Big Zipp. What it did have were two plain hamburger patties surrounded by a bun.  That's it.  And, to top it off, the onion rings weren't even fresh.  I was in a rush so I just ate the sandwich and a few of the rings.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I hope they figure out what is an obvious and easily avoidable QC problem.  However, for me, there are too many other dining options nearby and I won't be returning.  Update:  I just read Zipp's unintentionally amusing response to my review.  Pretty hard to believe, but apparently it was my fault after all:  I was remiss in not opening the styrofoam container to make sure there was tartar sauce, etc., on my burger.  Silly me.  I was also at fault for ordering carryout because, according to Zipps, it's probably not as good as dining in.  And as for the 'old' onion rings that deteriorated on the way home - I live three blocks away.   Lol.  What a clown show.  But it does explain a lot.",

For instance, the other night we finally got around to deciding on dinner late in the evening. We ordered a kids burger, Cesar salad, and a chicken sandwich. The kids burger was horrible. It looked and tasted like a hockey puck. So that went uneaten. The salad was ok, but my chicken sandwich had like the flattest piece of chicken in it. It was so flat and small, I was thinking this must've been a joke. Well, we were hungry and it was late so we ate some of the food. But what a waste of money. I guess we won't be ordering from Zipps for a long time.",

    "text": "My experience at this restaurant was probably one of the worst I've ever had. My friends and I went there for a Suns game and were seated at a booth near the door. As we were sitting there, a girl who was waiting for a table, looked above our table and saw a cockroach crawling right over our table. Now granted, I have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal. After the initial scare, I informed our waitress of this and she freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone. She didnt return for another 5 minutes, though it was only to bring drinks. I then told the host near the door and he exclaimed that it was horrible and he walked away(apparently to get someone?). After another 10 minutes still nothing happened so I found the guy again and told him nothing has been done yet. By this time, the others at my table had gotten their food. He told me that since it was so high on the ceiling there was no way for him to get to it. Now, I'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but I had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach. I didnt realize he was stumped. I felt like I should make a bigger deal about it, but instead I left. I don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat in those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify it. I mean, I dont have any delusions about spic and span restaurants. I know restaurants are dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our table is unacceptable. And the only reason the management would do nothing is because it would have made a scene. I guarantee you if everyone else in the restaurant had seen it or was experiencing it, SOMETHING would have been done. For us to have to endure it because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for them to do anything.   How was the food you ask? I didnt even see it since I was focusing on the large roach hanging over my table.",

I told the waitress that they were the wrong flavor and she kind of looked at me funny and told me that because they didn't have a toothpick in them they must be the right order and that I must be mistaken. When I told her I was positive they weren't the flavor I ordered she begrudgingly said she would go put in the order for the correct wings and she left the wrong wings on the table. Since it had been a while since we ordered and we were hungry and they left the wings on the table everyone at the table had another wing.  A couple minutes after the waitress left the assistant general manager came over and asked what was wrong with the wings. We told him they were the wrong flavor and he asked if we wanted a side of the correct flavor. We told him all we wanted were the wings we ordered. He said that he could do that but he would have to charge us for the wings with the incorrect sauce because we already ate some of them. We explained the situation and he told us that their policy was to have all managers come talk to customers when orders are incorrect, which was never explained to us.  The waitress didn't even tell us about the manager and had only said that she was going to ring in new wings. After a few minutes of arguing with the manager we asked for our bill (which they charged us for the wrong wings) and we left. The manager was condescending the entire time and even yelled stuff at us as we left. I used to love Zipps but I am never going back.",

Their sweet jalapeno sauce is to die for.....The service is for the most part pretty good....but the food makes up for it if the servers are busier than normal.  The only bad thing is if it's too crowded inside, you have to sit on the patio with all of the smokers which is gross especially when trying to eat, but they have to cater to everyone.  All in all, get the jalapeno burger or the monacco foccacia.  DELICIOUS!",

In fact, I would barely call them specials anymore. Saving 50 cents on a slice of pizza and a bottle of beer - not so special.   With that being said, the slices of pizza were pretty good and that was mostly due to the large amount of mushrooms on one slice. They say it is NY style, but only because it's cut in a triangle perhaps. The crust is crackery, not chewy like real NY pizza.      Other annoying things on this visit included a baby screeching for at least 45 minutes, the bar manager changing the game I was watching twice (and once he even confirmed I was watching that game) and the usual batch of annoying millenials. All other prices on this bar food menu are up three bucks as well.",

Inside skinny: Order a side of NM green chile for your burger for $1 and make sure you get a nice little heap and not a few squares you can count. I'm not some northerner doing this for a novelty, I'm seriously digging in. ---- The only suggestion for improvement would be to have 3 different things on the 3 TV screens that are RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER. And don't make one a sports chat that you know darn well we can't hear because you have Prince or Michael Jackson playing which SUCKED. ROCK N ROLL FOREVER!! I bet your clientele agrees.",

Instead of the typical batter on the outside, the mozzarella was wrapped with what I think was an egg roll skin. Looked kind of strange but for a mozzarella stick, it was awesome. Of course it's just a mozzarella stick & if you think it's going to be something transcendental, you're going to be let down. It's a good sports bar mozzarella stick though.  Just had to mention...",

Like all other Zipps in the area, they have shuffleboard, pool and darts. They also have a Galaga/Mrs. Pacman machine, so you can make halftime go by pretty quick.   When we first got there, there was kind of a funky smell, not sure if it went away, or I just got used to it. Also, their draft beer selection needs some work.

The staff at the time was awesome - however, with as much as we went in there, and being in the industry, they rarely helped you out on your tab. If you're not in the industry, you wouldn't understand, but for anyone that works in the biz, you know that most bartenders will slide you a few (especially if you and around 5-10 people come in nightly). Anyway, not the staffs fault, just a REALLY overwhelming ownership from what I am told.   But I still enjoyed it because the food is really good for a bar. The wings (golden) are really, really good. They do a wing night, or used to, when they were like half off. The monico foccacia is really good, too.   A great place to watch a game, shoot some pool and have a bite to eat.

    "text": "If you want a big cheap beer, a tired menu and below average service, this is your place. If you deviate one smidgen from the menu (hold the pickles please) you are out of luck.  Their staff seems like they all have the attention span of a nat.  This is OK when you are serving day drinkers who get lost in their huge beer, but for other people who still have to work for a living and are generally short on time find another restaurant. and hey.  An apology would be nice for having to recook my meal (add 15 minutes here) after I asked 3 times in different ways to hold the pickles when I was ordering to drive the point home. The managers are average and linger over half the time to see if the order was served correctly the second time around and wait around like a bellboy for a pat on the back for finally getting it served right.  So only have a few bucks in your pocket for a huge cheap draft beer and an entire afternoon to waste...?  Zipps should be at the top of your list!!!",

I didn't feel that this location had the normal Zipps atmosphere from other locations I've been to.  Maybe it was an off night I'm not sure, but it was a Saturday night.  I didn't like the layout and the service was ok.  The chambord margarita was lacking taste and it wasn't enough to order a second one.  The wings were also ok.  I chose hot with even a side of hot, but it seemed that the sauce they used was a different flavor from what I remember tasting.  I wasn't too impressed with the food or service so it's safe to say I probably won't be coming back to this particular location.",

The man gets halfway through his drink waiting for his food when the server comes up to him and starts yelling about the beverage. The man gets up to leave only to be met by the manager to get yelled at a second time to pay his full tab. No food had made it out to the guest but the manager was yelling at him to pay his full tab or he would call the police. The man walks past him and the manager chases him down and writes his license plate down and came back in the restaurant to call the police. The saddest part of all this... The man never got to finish his beer. Save your money, go elsewhere.",

I come from Vegas where there's not many places that have that hometown feel to it. This place has that! I loved it!  The menu was full of many different options. We tried the two types of wings to see which was better but they were both amazing!  We also tried one of the burgers which my fiancee really enjoyed. The big beers were just that...BIG!  They also had great happy hour specials. Their prices were very affordable. We ordered two baskets of wings, a burger with fries, a slice of pizza, two 32oz beers and it was like $30. Very cool!!  Definitely will return! Thanks!",

Their chicken is so flavorful and the honey balsamic dressing is delish!  My friend had one of their $3 Zipparitas and said it was really good, but strong.  The place was packed and noisy, and my one star off is because the table we were sitting at put our faces right next to the feet of people sitting on the level above us - kinda yucky.  But it was the only table available due to the wind storm outside.     Despite the crowd, service was really good and the food came out pretty fast.  i was impressed.  I will absolutely return there to pick up lunch during the workday.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located on the corner of Via de Ventura and Hayden, tucked away in a moderate sized strip mall. Zipps has a bunch of other locations throughout the Phoenix area, each of which with a pretty similar look and feel. The interior of the restaurant is your typical sports bar/restaurant. Televisions playing sports and a level of noise you'd come to expect from a bar. I've been to this restaurant 3 times and have had a very similar food experience each time. Two of the times were take-out and once was dine-in. I sat at a booth for the dine-in and let me say, it was less than comfortable. The wooden booth was slightly less comfortable than a park bench. The waitress had a bit of an attitude, but it seemed a little more directed to her work conditions than necesarily our table.  Over the times I've been here, I've had the Buffalo Chicken salad, the Monoco Focaccia and the Greek Chicken Salad. Their dishes are much too salty and many of the things were soggy. The Buffalo Chicken was so soggy it wilted the lettuce. The Focaccia and fries that came with it were soggy as well.  I'm sure Zipps would have been an entirely better experience had I been there with a bunch of friends, tipping back some drinks. In reality, I was there because I was hungry. Each time I've been disappointed by the food, so I would pass unless you're there to watch a sports game and tip back a few.",

They had soccer too during the EURO 2012 finals- so that gives them an extra boost.  Amazing wings, Spicy as he**, but so good. Great service. They don't cheap out on napkins, which is always important when you go through two napkins per juicy wing.  Food comes out pretty fast and fries are good. Don't have artificial taste. Prices are right on and you can come out with a full meal and some booze for about 20 bucks a person.",

    "text": "I have always had good service and good to excellent food at any Zipps location.  BUT if you want a burger that is absolutely delicious and cooked just right this is the place!! My favorite burger is the green chili cheese burger which comes with 2 beef patties and is guaranteed to be so juicy that it will drip down the front of your shirt (happens to me all the time!!!!)   And, if you are chicken wing \"aficionado\" you can go mild to smoking hot but also try their dry wings (my choice).   The place can get a little noisy particularly in the evenings and some of their locations are worse than others. I don't think acoustics is big priority when they set up their restaurants so if you don't mind hearing all of the conversations that are going on at the same time or are half deaf (that what my wife says) then it won't bother you!!              So ....... in conclusion, at least 4-stars and if you want to dribble hamburger juice down the front of your shirt, this is the place!!!",

A few of my favorites include (but are not limited to) Chicken Skewers, any & all of their focaccias (the Monaco being my personal fave), Zipparitas, and DO NOT get me started on their onion rings.  i could seriously eat a basket (or 2 or 10) of these onion rings with a side of sweet jalapeno dressing for dipping.  Only one complaint Zipps, you have no Tucson location! :'(",

What really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasn't good. Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back. Don't bother when in the same complex there are truly excellent places to spend your money.",

    "text": "This place is TERRIBLE. Came here last night with my co-worker after a long day at a work related trade show. We were in the mood for something relaxed and desperately wanted a drink. We were happy to hear that it was happy hour and margaritas were on the menu! Sign us up! We both ordered a blended strawberry margarita and the chicken finger appetizers. Our drinks came out and we both were like wtf? Normally a strawberry margarita is BLENDED and a reddish pink color. These were not.... All the strawberry was at the bottom and a gross weirdly flavored margarita mix blend was on top. The first sip was like drinking a sugar mix. We had to take our straws and try to mix it up. Once we did that, they were good. The chicken fingers were okay, nothing special. They came with a side of onion rings which were totally over fried that we had to remove the batter and eat only the onions. We had a hard time choosing what to eat as it all sounded good. We both settled on the club focaccia sandwich which sounded very good. Turkey, ham, bacon and Swiss cheese with a garlic mayo on focaccia bread. When it comes out we both look at each other like \"is this the wrong sandwich?\" It looked like a turkey wrap. It was NOT focaccia bread. We asked our waitress and she said that yes it IS focaccia bread. Ummm no it was more like a tortilla bread wrap of some sort. It was so dry we couldn't eat it. We asked her for more mayo and she brought out honey mustard. Okay? Whatever. We used it. Barely. Neither of us could really eat that wrap, it was freaking terrible. And the worst part was that the \"focaccia\" bread wasn't fully cooked. It was sticky/gooey. Not appetizing. We ended up taking the meats off and dipping them in the mustard and eating them. The fries that came with our sandwiches were so greasy and limp, I could barely eat them. Our waitress never came by to ask how our meal was and at the end when we were done she came to get our baskets but never asked how our food was. I imagine she saw we barely ate any of it and decided not to ask so she wouldn't have to hear that it was SHIT. We paid our tab and left her $5. I think that got our point across. Thankfully I will never have to eat here again as we live in Sonoma CA where the chefs know wtf focaccia bread really is and it is NOT a tortilla.",

We had Jenna as a waitress.  She was rude, slow and generally didn't care for the customer. We asked to order when we sat down because we are all very familiar with the menu and were hungry.  Jenna said we couldn't order yet because she wasn't ready.  I'm not making this up.  All of our food was cold when received it.  We said something to both the gentleman that brought our food and Jenna. The funny part was neither cared. It is really a shame knowing how good zipps can be yet this location is being ruined due to its staff.  There are way too many other options then to go to a place where you're treated like this.",

They have different late  specials (food and drink) every night which can turn this spot into a great watering hole. I am such a foodie and have been exploring the valley for years but this place is my favorite for consistent late night food paired with great late night specials! Also- great service at the bar-Missy is amazing but Rachel and Sarah are wonderful as well! Service standards are a large part of my consideration and they have never made me feel anything but welcome and cared for.",

The food is always pretty good, nothing amazing but its a consistent quality that is right in line with the sports bar setting that it's in. Fun atmosphere with plenty of sports on (duh) and the ability to play darts, pool, or shuffleboard is great.  The wings on special are a great deal, and the 'Golden style' is always a great choice. The 'Zipparitas' are surprisingly strong and delicious for a small little frozen margarita, but it makes it a good choice for a non-beer happy hour drink.  However, the service can be hit or miss. I've had great service as well as quite poor service here. I understand it's ability to have a packed house can affect the promptness of service, but often enough it doesn't correlate and boils down to just a bad server (or at least a server having a bad night).",

Although we had 10 kids with us were a little weary of bringing them to a sports bar. It turned out to be great. There were others in there with kids and the bar is just loud enough so you can't hear bratty kids screaming and the food was just to their liking.   I had a mushroom burger and a Greek salad that was very good and my hubby had wings which he said were second to none.   My only gripe is that we had to wait a little longer but to be honest that should be expected on a Saturday night when you come in with 14 people.   Overall I highly recommend this place!",
