    "text": "This is the real deal, folks!  ----------------------------  Quite a few colleagues in my office have been afflicated with the cold bug lately, and as much as I tried to avoid it, I woke up this morning with some  scratchiness in the back of my throat.  Sure, there's Zicam and Cold-Eeze and Vitamin C pills and all that hoo-hah. But I knew there was another vital weapon as well - a good, hearty bowl of pho. It worked like gangbusters for me in San Francisco so why not in Phoenix?  And so I pondered the recommendation given to me by the helpful waiter at China Chili and headed to Da Vang.   Da Vang is located in a small, worn strip-mall (on 19th Ave just north of Campbell) completely consisting of Vietnamese businesses. And as I was parking, I saw two separate Asian families walking in, which was a good sign: I knew this was place was going to be different.   Once inside, you notice the place is extremely casual and is family-run. At least 6 relatives are behind the register/counter area being busy doing who knows what. Then you have all the Vietnamese patronage - which definitely has to count for something. And so I sat down and ordered the spring rolls, the pho tai (beef broth with noodles and medium-rare thinly-cut beef slices) and some hot tea.   The spring rolls came with the requisite fish sauce and tasted pretty good, but it was the bowl of pho which was the main attraction. Just looking at it you knew it was the real thing - not watered down to cater to the tastes of as large of a crowd as possible, but still great tasting in its own right. So in went the bean sprouts, the torn up basil leaves, and sliced chilis, and the squeezed lime juice. A little bit of chili sauce to taste and I was in noodle soup heaven. The beef was cooked just perfect, and the noodles were just the right consistency. I ate with chopsticks until there was nothing left to grab at, and switched to the soup spoon to savor the rest of the broth. Mmm...tasty.   Protein, carbs, and hot pepper - talk about a coldbuster in a bowl. Who needs Jamba Juice?  And another great thing? Besides the food being good and authentic? Dirt cheap! Spring rolls, pho, and tea together cost $6.75. And I was STUFFED by the end of my meal.  Sometimes you have to sift through a lot of coal to find a gem, and I'd liken Da Vang to this area of Phoenix, but what a find. I'll definitely be back. And again, my gratitude to China Chili guy, without whose recommendation I probably never would have sauntered in there in the first place.   Thumbs up.  ---------------------------------------  EDITED TO DOCK ONE STAR: I wrote the above review about 15 minutes after eating my meal. However, not long after that, I was sitting in the coffeehouse feeling like I was going to pass out. I felt that drugged, and realized it could only be one thing: MSG. LOTS of MSG.   Oh Da Vang, you really had a good thing going on - for one hour.",

Until tonight, that is. Honestly, I can't tell you what I had (it was the #27) but I can tell you it was wonderful! Strikingly fresh vegetables, great meat; amazing! And we arrived 15 minutes before they were scheduled to close on this Monday evening. [Truth be told, we weren't the only ones going close to 8 p.m. At least half a dozen others were converging upon Da Vang as they were trying to close up shop, and all were allowed to order.]  Da Vang, now that I know you're my little jewel in the strip mall--and near a strip club, no less--I shall be seeing more of you and sampling all your bounties.",

The place is clean, the service was great and everybody was very friendly. We ordered the spring rolls that were translucent and looked appetizing, but there was just no love for them. The beef soup was ok, but not memorable enough to order it again. The sandwiches looked great but I wanted to try the entrees.  I need to come back one day and go with someone that really knows Vietnamese food and knows what I like. This place gets stellar reviews so it has to be me. I give them 4 stars because the staff was very helpful and friendly, offered to take back the spring rolls and fry them and were patient with us. What was memorable, however, was their kick-ass desserts. They were great and I think we ordered 3. Banana with tapioca and coconut milk, white bean with sweet rice and coconut milk, and something with taro.  This place has to be one of the nest values in The Valley- inexpensive with great food (and desserts) extremely clean and with excellent service.  I'll be back.",

Two bowls of pho and two orders of goi cuon for $15-16 is a steal. Very homely taste to the broth and finally a place where goi cuon is inexpensive (it's $2.50 for two pieces). The Vietnamese music in the background and the decent amount of Vietnamese people dining inside add to the authenticity of the place.   But beware of the shady area it's in. Located in a tiny strip mall in a not so great area of Phoenix, I would not feel comfortable driving a really nice car here. Or if you had to because it's your only form of transportation, then I'd recommend parking it in front of the restaurant where you can at least keep an eye on it through the windows while you're eating. Probably not the cleanest restaurant either but I'll keep coming back until I find a reason to not to lol.    When I have a craving for Vietnamese food I'll be back to have my fill until I can make it back home and eat some good food in San Jose.",

Once a it's done dripping, mix it in the glass they give you THEN pour it over the ice.    The beef stew is so flavorful and it's one of my favorites. I also like adding extra vegetables to any soup that doesn't come with it. The veggies always have a nice crunch to them and taste fresh.   It's definitely worth a try!",

Banh Cuon is one of my favorite Vietnamese dishes and it's not easy to make at home so I'm always on the look out for a good place to buy Banh Cuon. So far the best place for Banh Cuon is Banh Cuon Tay Ho in the Westminster area of Orange County CA. I was hoping to find something comparable in the Phoenix AZ area. I was really glad to see all the good reviews about this place. Even though the atmosphere left much to be desired (most Vietnamese restaurants do), I was still hoping for the food to make up for the location and decor. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the Banh Cuon they served. It was not good. It wasn't fresh. The other dishes were jusokay. I would not come back.",

Although 1B was very large, the soup taste like pepper water and most of the bowl was just noodle with little meat. I would not get this dish again. I also did not like broth for number 7, which tasted like tomato water. The only component I enjoyed for both noodles soups was the soft tender beef in 7. The springs rolls were also only average, which average dipping sauce. And the banh mi were okay, with the best part being the baguette. The service at Da Vang was great despite it being very crowded during lunch time, but I will not being coming back for pho.",

The restaurant isn't full of decorations or anything fancy, just straight-forward food that the local Vietnamese seem to like, as the restaurant was full.   We started off a bit confused, so our waiter (we told him it was our first time) really helped us along the way.  We started with a pork/shrimp spring roll appetizer that you make yourself.  He showed us how, and it was fun and delicious!  For our entrees, we decided to order a few different things, and each try them.  We got a beef/meatball pho, a stir-fry noodle dish with pork, chicken, squid, crab and many veggies and a banh mi with bbq pork (we ended up getting 2 of these, since they were only $2.50 each).  There was plenty of food to go around...the portions are huge!  Everything was really good. We debated on whether to try a dessert, so we asked our trusty waiter what he thought, and he brought us over 3 different ones.  They all had crushed ice and coconut milk/cream, but they had different items included...1 had clear noodles, 1 had various beans and the last one had bean paste and seaweed with noodles.  The funny thing is, we each tried a little of all of them, but we all favored different ones.  I personally enjoyed the one with garbanzo beans...who knew??? After we finished our meal, we went up to the cashier, to find out the entire bill came to $34!!  What???  Between the 3 of us, we ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 3 desserts and beverages...amazing! On the way out, we picked up the pork buns (not sure of the actual name for it) to take home and try.  They looked really interesting, so one of my friends bought them for us.  The cashier explained how to make it later, which turned out to be perfect.  I shared it with my husband at home, and he loved it! All in all, we had a great time, and can't say enough about how nice and helpful the staff were to us.  It was a great first experience!",

If you disagree, I am sorry. But if you haven't tried both restaurants up the street from the other and you love Pho, I would deffinately go for the taste test on the 2!",

I haven't had food from this place in years, but since our regular spot was closed, we came in here to get our fix.    After our meal, I remembered why I hadn't visited this place for a long time. The food sucks.  And I feel bad for everyone who thinks this place is awesome, cause you guys have sterile taste buds.",

I order the ca kho to (carmelized catfish) - my boyfriend said this smelled and looked awful, but I love fish and this was really tasty. It was also like 2.5 meals worth for under $7.  My boyfriend ordered the veggie rice noodle dish - he wasn't a huge fan of the veggie mix (cabbage, onions, bok choy and carrots) but I thought it was really good. The gravy/sauce they stir try it in is really tasty.  Definitely will be back!",

The staff are so busy at times that you'd better ask for what you need when they approach you. The bill is at the front, so this is on the honor system. I do recommend the Thai tea, I think everyone should try some. The Vietnamese coffee is strong enough to keep you up at night, so skip it if you're ordering after 3pm. I love the sandwiches, specifically the BBQ pork, which I believe to be the best on the sandwiches there. Pho, of course, that IS the mainstay. Highly recommended for foodies on a budget. Enjoy!",

Please understand though, its the real deal. The restaurant is in a dimly lit strip mall that's easy to miss. Look for the water dispensary in the parking lot. When you walk in you'll probably notice its older and surprise, surprise full of Vietnamese!  Don't expect the ambience of the Rice Paper Eatery. At Da Vang you'll be greeted by Vietnamese, not hipsters.   My recommendation: Beef Pho, fried rice, and spring rolls.",

I knew what I wanted already so I ordered. Not even 2 mins later I had my spring rolls, then 3 mins later I had my pho. Super fast service.  I Love Pho and I love to try it at all different places because it never seems to taste the same. I would have to say though this is not my favorite Bowl I have taste it. The broth seem to lack in flavor and seems a bit more oily than normal. At least compared to any other pho I've ever had. Spring rolls tasted great just like any other spring roll along with the peanut sauce. Overall, the service was great, it was super fast, and although the pho was a bit oily, it was still overall good. Probably wouldn't mind coming back to this location.",

If you don't speak Vietnamese some of the wait staff will be extremely rude to you in Viet. Like smile to your face and talk shit behind your back.   2. The have things on the menu but will tell you they ran out or that it takes too long to make. Why even have it on the menu? Maybe it's because I'm Vietnamese and he wants to be candid with me but still.   3. Their food isn't good enough for service to be this bad. Like I accept at most Asian restaurants service will take the back seat. But I only come back if the foods SO good I can overlook it.   TLDR Food is not good enough for the poor level of service. Eat here if you want them to make fun of you.",

After noticing all the high ratings here, I decided to try it, and this is finally the pho that I like. Turns out, I didn't realize that DaVang's has been here for a long time, and my mom used to bring me here when I was little. I loved it then, and I love it now!  The prices are reasonable and the soups are so good. I can't put my finger on it, but when pho is done right, it is done right, and it is absolute heaven. Pho is one of my comfort foods, so coming here for spring rolls, pho, and maybe a dessert after a long day of work always makes my day instantly better. My friends have also been impressed with the quality of the food here when I bring them. The servers are always really nice to us. They never rush us out, even when we are indecisive about dessert and wind up spending a long time just sitting and chatting after our meal.",

I ordered to go and it was all packed very well that nothing spilled. My only complain was the sauce for the spring rolls. I requested the clear orange sauce instead of the peanut sauce and it was very watered down or something was wrong with it and the flavor was bad. I'm not sure if they just have a different recipe from the other Vietnamese restaurants but I couldn't eat it at all as it tasted awful. I couldn't eat the spring rolls neither. Part of it was my fault because I forgot that they had basil. I didn't request them without basil and it had some other weird thing that tasted different and I didn't like it at all. It looked like fish or some sort of meat but I thought it only contained shrimp as a meat. Next time I'll make sure to know all of the ingredients.   They were very friendly. Regardless, I am very picky but I will consider this place as one of my to go Vietnamese restaurants.",

Once I am off this kick, I will have to try the Pho which all my friends state is the best in Phoenix. They answer the phone \"hello again\" and it really makes you feel warm inside. Only bad thing is there are always 1 or 2 beggers outside. I try to comply as much as I can, but it is real annoying after the 5th time.",

The servers are polite and happily accommodate diet restrictions!   The prices are incredibly reasonable.  I can purchase a full nutritious meal here with less than what I would need for a fast food combo! That is a steal!  The place is large enough to accommodate their growing number of customers.     Now that's all fine and dandy but lets get to the good stuff! The food! Oh their food!! I think children are the worst critics when it comes to food and my little one just wipes the plate clean.

I know how to cook and can tell which seasonings  are used most of the time. I couldn't figure out which secret ingredient was used to make the food so good. However, I will definitely come back and try new things. It was quite a drive for my family, but it's totally worth it. Expect to wait a little to be seated as this place is packed with customers. Don't expect to be in an immaculate restaurant. This ain't Cheesecake Factory, but I'm sure you'll be surprised how cheap your bill would be when you pay at the register.",

We ended up under a couple of a/c vents and decided it may have been warmer outside, even in January (ok I stretched that a little but nobody took off their coats).

They took our order and were out of my gf's first choice. Then when the garneshes were brought they forgot the culantro (sp). Our water glasses were empty as i asked for the culantro (again sp), they brought a small plate of a few leves that was fine for me, and did not fill the water cups.  I have been going to pho restaurants for years in Hi and Az, this will be our last time dining here, or maybe 3rd times a charm if we do not find a better place",

The broth has this homemade taste that is made with love and care. It reminds me of the pho my mom use to make back at home.   Last but not least.. The rice plates. By far the best Com Thit Nuong I've ever had. Make sure you order an egg to take that rice plate to the next level.   I have wet dreams thinking about the food here. Enjoy!!",

We did have to add some shrimp paste to it but it is understandable as shrimp paste is an acquired taste.  It is a requirement for True bun bo but we do live in America, not VN, so an adjustment is needed to feed the consensus.    I had Pho.  It was also very tasty and had lots of meat.  No skimping here.  Broth was clear and rich.  Definitely hit the spot.    Favorite oldest son had rice with pork chops.  He inhaled it.  It was apparently so good that he wouldn't share any with us.  Favorite daughter had spring rolls.  They were a good size and weren't stuffed with noodles to take up space.  The rolls had a good amount of meat and shrimp in them with an even balance of veggies.    Favorite youngest son had Bun Thit Nuong a noodle and pork dish (dry, not soupy).  He also inhaled his dish.  The fish sauce was also just right for him that he finished most of his sauce dish too...  We will definitely be back on our next trip to Phx",

I ordered a Thai hot Coffee while looking over the menu.

    "text": "I ended up here via Phx Newstimes suggestion. I ordered Togo. It's weird to me inside. I get the clean and stark appeal of restaurants but it cld have been warmer inside. More inviting and less institutional looking. At any rate, I ordered the fresh spring rolls, grilled pork and egg roll rice  vermicelli with combination fried rice.  The fried rice was awful. It incl what appeared to be cut up hot dog. That's nocando for me. The spring rolls were actually the best I've  had in a while. I loved the dipping sauce. It wasn't the traditional peanut and I really liked it. The rice vermicelli salad was really lame. No flavor. The grilled pork was even weirder than the hot dog in the fried rice. Suprisingly the egg rolls chopped on top were great! I will keep that in mind. The vermicelli needed more mint. I appreciate the person who bagged the order incl everything wo having to ask. I'm impressed with that. Even the garlic chili sauce! I ordered the same items from three different vietnamese places listed in the Phx Newstimes on Twitter. This place came in third behind my regular, a new place also in PhxNt. I don't know if I will be back.",

Just point randomly at the menu and order something.  Service: A little on the slow side, but the food is so good that I don't care. That's a very high compliment from me, because I'm NOT forgiving.  Ambiance: None. This place is a dump, and I don't care: This IS Phoenix, so we're all trash anyway! (Especially YOU, Scottsdale snobs, I KNOW who you are! lol) The fluorescent lighting is lurid and harsh on the eyes. No music playing. It's a miracle that the sagging ceiling didn't fall upon our heads. This restaurant is literally on its last legs. Very much in need of a remodel and a makeover.   So, put on your dirty soiled wife beater, and your flip flops, and you're set. Da Vang is devine!",

They cook just like my mom cooks and the staffs have become like family to me because I was a very frequent customer.   I recommend everything here especially their pho bo kho and com tam or broken rice dishes. Everything is authentic and is packed with a lot of meat and flavors that just burst in your mouth every spoonful.I am not a person who tends to order desserts, but when I come here I always get their che and a drink. This is definately a great place for a full rounded meal.   Even on a scorching hot summer day a piping hot bowl of pho is still on my mind; only from Da Vang. Thank you guys.",

I love when places serve culantro with their fresh herbs and this place is one of the few that I've found that do. Herbs were fresh. The service is impersonal but fast and efficient. Place was packed on a Sunday at 1:00 pm but no wait and good was brought out promptly. Would return for sure.",

    "text": "Tried Da Vang on Saturday night because of all the great reviews and to treat an out of town guest to  Vietnamese cuisine.  I will start with the service.  3 people--3 entrees ordered.  The Pho came out 25 minutes after ordering,  the next dish came 25 minutes after the PHO and the third dish.....well..... we wondered about since it was NOT arriving.  We actually thought they had forgotten about the third dish. Embarrassingly, the third dish was for the out of town guest who wanted to try Vietnamese food.  So to sum it up, the service gets rounded up to  \"zero\" stars.  How can you serve 3 entrees in the course of an hour and 20 minutes to the same table and have each customer eating their food alone while the others watch?  It is called \"dining\"  not eating because the act is part of a larger social experience.  If I wanted to \"eat\" I would have bought a gyro and eaten it in my car.  So, definitely a big zero for service. Now for the food.  The chicken PHO was mediocre at best.  Hubby said that on a scale of 1-10, it was a 4.  He named 6 other vietnamese restaurants who do it better including the PHO place in the Gila River Casino in Chandler.  Really Da Vang?  You allow yourself to be beat out on PHO by a casino food court outfit?  Shame on you. Pho's should be your go-to dish!   Next: Stir fried noodles with pork & shrimp.  Way below par.  Had to add Siracha sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce to get any taste out of it.  And the pork  appeared to be scraps of pork (not pieces) cut lengthwise and very thin; and by the way Da Vang, thanks for the 3 small (and I mean small) shrimp you added to the dish.  Never, never, never, never, EVER---that's what my stomach is saying about me even thinking about ordering this dish EVER again.  Next: Sauteed beef with lemongrass over rice.  This was the definite winner of the three with a score of 5 out of ten.  The beef was not trimmed and fat prevailed.  Now, I know that fat is where it's at in terms of flavor but enough is enough.  Again, fish sauce and soy sauce had to be added to make it palatable.  AND FINALLY: The spring rolls ordered with Tofu instead of shrimp and pork were good and a good value.  Other than that... Not too much to be said for Da Vang.  Between the service and the less than stellar food,  I won't be there any time soon.....  Wait......wait....., wait a minute, I hear something.........  It's my stomach ....saying NO WAY JOSE....   I guess I won't  be going back ever again.  Stomach rules!!!!!!!!",

I had limited contact with the employees as I got the order to go but they spoke English well and seemed friendly. The worst part was the location, as others have mentioned, is not the best. It is a little hole in the wall in a strip mall. There are known tweekers in this area and I had one approach me while leaving claiming he was Clark Kent.

I am not saying that you walk in and believe you wormholed yourself to little Saigon, but authentic enough to believe that what they create in their kitchen is what you could get served in the most Vietnamese establishment the Americas has to offer. Like someone said \"Pho is what happens when former child soldiers pour hot rainwater over fish nightmares\" and I was dying to try it.   And as much as I did enjoy the freshness of it, I must say that it didn't impress me the way I expected it to. In retrospective I am not sure what I possibly could have expected, having had extensive culinary adventures in Asia. I will have to come to terms on my feeling regarding Pho somewhere down the road.   I did taste a sandwich here as well, and that was surprisingly tasty. I wouldn't come here just for the sandwich, but if I find myself here again I am quite certain that I will sample more of their menu. All this being directed to the food, I must say as far as service at atmosphere goes - there isn't much of either. But as long as one comes for a particular item I am sure that this place will please food-wise, not experience-wise.",

We were seated promptly with menus and ice water arriving shortly. Drink orders were taken and the extensive menu perused. My daughter ordered her usual: Pho with brisket and Spring Rolls with BBQ pork. I ordered the Noodles with shrimp, crab and fish meatball (#29).   My daughter dove into her Pho with abandon. I've had it before and, to me, the broth was bland.  She said it was fine but added hoisin, chili paste, Thai basil and bean sprouts so it seemed blase to me. The spring rolls were excellent. Very plump, colorful, crunchy vegetables and fresh.   My dish was good and I would order it again. There was just the right amount of Bok Choi to make it a good accompaniment, the noodles were soft but not mushy and there was plenty of tasty protein.   I really wanted some sort of fried noodle dish, similar to Thai Pad Thai or Chinese Chow Mien but the service was still a bit lacking and didn't offer much help so I got #29.",

Btw, don't come here if you want great customer service. It's all about the great food!",

    "text": "JD Invades AZ Day 3:  I know what you all are thinking: you flew over 600-miles just to eat Pho? Well ordinarily you're right--I would never go to AZ to eat Pho in 90-degree heat, especially since we have World Class Pho back home in San Jose. However, my good Yelp bud, Laz C, had never had Pho before and as the unofficial Pho-King of Yelp, it was my duty--nay! Privilege to take his Pho-Cherry away. So, we did our research and Da Vang (DV) was the most convenient Pho spot to Laz's work. So we hooked up on a sunny and warm Phoenix Spring Day. Here are our chronicles:  48: Goi Cuon Tom Thit (Spring Rolls)- I was not too impressed with DV's Spring Rolls; the Rice Paper was too thick and sticky and the spring rolls themselves weren't as fresh as I'm used to. Also, instead of Peanut Sauce they served them up with a cup of Hoisin Sauce sprinkled with Peanuts. I'm not sure if that's customary in certain types of Vietnam, or what, but that's not the way we roll in SJ. 2.5*  1B: Pho Da Vang Xe Lua (Pho sliced beef, brisket, tendon, tripe, and beef meatballs):   Broth- I was surprised how good DV's broth was because, to be honest, I was expecting some fake wanna-be Pho out here in the Desert where most people don't know any better. It didn't have some of the nice subtle complexity that Pho broth can have, but the beefy flavor was on point. 3.75*  Noodles- Standard Pho noodles and they hook you up pretty good with the amount. Now, if they had fresh noodles I would've been way impressed, but alas you can't get everything. 3*  Meat- The meat was pretty good, but they weren't very generous with it. I was too engrossed in our conversation to remember to order the steak raw on the side-- Pho-Jester is more like it. 3*  44: Com Ga Nuong (Steamed Rice with BBQ Chicken)- I ordered this for my 3-year-old and was surprised he ate the tomatoes and most of the chicken. He's pretty picky so I'll have to rate it based on his discerning palate. 4* (Lance rating)  Service & Ambiance- Pretty standard Pho service in that you get the minimum number of visits to your table, but at least they were friendly and didn't grunt at us. DV is located in a pretty suspect Phoenix neighborhood; I wasn't 100% sure, but Laz confirmed it as I guess he used to live close by once upon a time. With that being said, it wasn't super-ghetto, but ghetto enough to add to the charm. 3.5*-service/4*-ambiance  Value- I was surprised how cheap the Pho prices are here compared to SJ; where a bowl of Pho is averaging around $8, DV's average price is around $5. Great value for what it is. 5*  I'd like to thank Laz again for letting me be his guide into the world of Pho and for being a fantastic dining companion. As for DV, I'd say they deserve an overall 3.5-star but I'll give them the 4-star bump because I was pleasantly surprised for AZ and they have a tremendous value.",

Searched again and found Da Vang was only 3 more minutes away. In a little shady section of town but dont be afraid!!!  Located in a strip plaza, plenty of parking.  Everyone is friendly...most speak enough english. The Pho is Pho-nomenal!!! Super yummy broth, very authentic. Regular or large sizes and so much variety to pick from.  The pricing is just ridiculously cheap. $4.75 for an amazing bowl of Pho Tai!  Spring and Summer Rolls are very fresh and come with lettuce and dipping sauces.  Less than $3.50 each.   The best surprise are the Banh Mi Sandwiches for $3 a piece.  I always take one home to eat later cause I cant finish everything I order while I'm there.  The food is great, atmosphere is ...well...authentically vietnamese and they do have a working bathroom lol.  Great meal and friendly staff with the cheapest prices.  Been back about 4 times.  You cant go wrong with your order!",

    "text": "Da Vang! You mean \"Da Best\" I mean that didn't rhyme but what can I say I'm not a rapper!  Da Vang is a vietnamese restaurant, located on Camelback where most of the undiscovered restaurants are located at. It's definitely family owned and It really isn't trying to be anything else but that! I mean when you think authentic, you think of the food tasting and looking exactly of how they would cook if it were at home, or a friends house. And thats what Da Vang brings to the table, it brings you delicious house made broths and tasty pastries and treats. Everything was made to order cause the food was pipping hot and definitely fresh made. Everyone who has been here will recall the pasty yellow walls and cheesy asian decor, and somewhat okay customer service, but the staff here is genuinely kind, all you need is patience. But I mean it's definitely not the glitz and glam of what you assume an pho restaurant is, the culture, the food and the awesome people around you is what makes the experience even better. So feeling soupy? Did you drink too much the following day? Well get yourself up and come to Da Vang! You won't regret it and if you do, well I don't know you but other than PHOenix, you stay hungry!",

The debit/credit system was down that resulted in only accepting cash. This led to a good 15 minute detour to get cash back at a circle k around the corner. Not terrible but inconvenient nonetheless.  We were seated immediately which was nice. Our waiter however was a little pushy for us to order with checking in about ever minute or so. The food came pretty quick though. I thought it was a bit odd that the chopsticks were in an open container at the table where they were just out to anybody as opposed to them being individually wrapped. Not a huge deal but a little weird. The pho was really good. Nice and spicy the way I like it. I really enjoyed it. Overall, the date went great and the pho was a good idea, but I won't be returning. I'll stick to my go-to's for pho next time.",

From filthy floors, nasty things stuck in/around/on the tables, to food stuck to plates/cups/chopsticks.... now, i don't mind eating at dirty little hole-in-the-wall places when i'm in third world countries, but not in the freakin' U.S., when i know i can get the same or better food at the same prices at a much cleaner place with much better service. but, that was before....  I hesitantly revisited yesterday, to give them a \"second chance\" since they've re-opened since being closed. their prices are still low, service still suuuucks, but it is thankfully a bit cleaner. since it was too hot for pho, i decided to try the vermicelli noodles with bbq pork and egg roll - all layered on a bed of bean sprouts, lettuce, mint and basil leaves ($4.75). you pour the fish sauce allllllllll over and eat. It was meh, good-ish, although nothing that makes da vang's better than any other. in fact, i thought the portion was on the skimpy side, but meh. the spring rolls were large, although a bit chewy ($2).  My bf ordered the bbq beef on rice ($6.75), and they FORGOT his food. granted, we were in a huge party of 12, but when we tried to remedy it, the waiter had to go through his orders, and then he said, \"oh yes, # blah blah blah, bbq pork. yes, it's still coming.\" although it was apparently NOT being cooked at that minute, since several in our party had already finished their meals. meh. so not only was it forgotten, it was also all bone and fat. being one of the more \"expensive\" items on the menu, you expect it to be much better quality.  so. i guess it's ok, since it's cheap. it's a hassle to get to because of construction, and the food isn't amazing enough to warrant that. i think i'd only consider take-out if i was in the area and craving vietnamese food. i just hate eating IN the restaurant here. definitely NOT my favorite vietnamese place (yes, even in phoenix) by a mile.",

It's relatively healthy too. Don't be scared by the strip mall location.  The fried egg rolls are as delicious as they get, wrapped in lettuce and dipped in fish sauce. The spring rolls are light and refreshing.  The Pho is always tasty. For the standard beef slices only (no organs or weird stuff), order 2A. You can order it in large or \"superbowl\" which is comically huge for only a bit more.  Barbecue pork chop rice, 39B is delicious and the broken rice has the best chewy texture.  The bahn mi sandwiches are also great at $2.25. 74 is shredded pork which is flavorful with the pickled veggies, cilantro, mayo and hot peppers. It does contain some collagen-meat, however. The barbecue pork sandwich (75) is also tasty but does have some fatty meat in it.  You don't come here for the service or the atmosphere, but for the FOOD. It does get busy around lunchtime on the weekends but service is generally quick. They close at 8pm.",

My stepmom was telling us about how there was this really great Vietnamese place that she knew of way back-- about 15 years ago-- and she wasn't even sure they were still open. So, we decided to take her word for it and see if Da Vang still existed.  To our surprise, it was! Despite its dive-y appearance, we walked in and were very politely greeted by what seems to be the owning family of the restaurant-- I can't be positive though. We were seated immediately and when we looked at the large but accommodating menu, we were also welcomed by the wonderful aroma that filled the room.  Anyways, to make a long story short, we ended up going to Da Vang 4 times that week. It's so delicious that it's addictive! The Pho soups are AMAZING! EVERYONE MUST TRY THE SPICY BEEF SALAD!!!! Eggrolls and springrolls are fresh and made to order, and all of their food seems to have the homey feel of a meal cooked with some genuine TLC-- and it all came out to less than $30 for the three of us! More than likely- we'll be going to Da Vang at least once a week!",

I ordered the bahn mih and one of the vermecelli plates with grilled meat and egg rolls... and it was just alright.  The price was about right for comparable food but I was definitely expecting A LOT more of the bahn mih (it sucked compared to Lee's Sandwiches; the bread was too bready and NOT a baguette but instead that used for a sub sandwich).  The neighborhood was also sketch.  I came here on a weekday around 3pm and there were some strange characters hanging out in front.",

We were craving some good Vietnamese food and after reading all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this restaurant, decided to give it a try. The place itself has a lot to be desired, but not even the dirty floor and a filthy door handle scared us off. After all, the other 30+ people loved the food. So was the food worth the experience? Not at all! I am still trying to figure out what is so special about the spring rolls the reviewers are raving about. This place made Pei Wei seem like top of the line Asian cuisine.",

I'd give the restaraunt 5 stars but the service and cleanliness is not there. The restaruant could use a remodel.  Now onto the food: I love their rice dishes. No complaints. But their Pho is ok. To me it tastes different every time I eat it.....Thats probably why I really try to just stick to the rice plate.   Prices are pretty cheap. No complaints here either.   I recommend this place if your in the Phoenix area.",

Had the seaweed, bean, and lotus seed drink, which was tasty if you could get by the appearance and hard work it took to drink/eat it.  Prices are extremely reasonable...

I also love a good dive restaurant too, so I was excited when I heard about this place.  My husband and I both ordered the pho and the spring rolls.  The pho broth was okay, but the sprouts and herbs to accompany were VERY old and withered.  They looked to be about a week old or so.  It was very unappetizing.  I did mention it to the server and she kind of shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  Fresh ingredients are a must in Vietnamese cooking.  Maybe it was a fluke, but I don't think we'll go back.",

Their spicy fish was seasoned perfectly and not too spicy to enjoy, the Pho is the best in Phoenix although I can barely tell the difference if I am being honest and they have my favorite the Bahn Mi.  Hard to find in the city and really hard to find with the right bread.  I try to go her at least every couple weeks.   The service is not great but seriously if you are going to complain about that I say \"look around fool do these folks look like they care about customer service they are packed because their food is bomb....they don't care about your 15% tip.\"",

This is one of them. Years ago, not so much, but the food and restaurant have both improved 100%.  The boys that run the floor are fast, and attentive.  Much friendlier than another nearby Vietnamese Restaurant on Camelback at 17th AV. that shall remain nameless. The option for salads is nice to have as Vietnamese salads are one of my favourites, and their many take out items including the chilled desserts make my visits there complete.  They have a huge menu and I have never had a bad meal there.  The BBQ beef plate is my favourite, but they don't have it all the time.  Don't let that stop you, as the rest of the menu is great.

I ordered the pho without meat, so just vegetables. To add heat they have a bottle of siracha and some other sweet and tangy sauce out of a bottle, both full of preservatives, cheap quality ingredients. My dad ordered the beef pho and he was adding kikoman soy sauce to add salt and flavor. To me this is not the proper way to season or spice a hot and fresh soup. Only natural chilies, ingredients, spices should be added to flavor. Cheap sauces and spices out of a bottle to flavor fresh soup is like wearing a suit and tie to dine at Mcdonalds, just doesn't mix well. Safe to say I will try some other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, which there seems to be plenty of.",

My theory is that Vietnamese places are usually a little dirty cause it's good luck!   The BBQ pork Banh mi just makes my mouth so damn horny! I'm dripping just thinking about it! Be sure to try the Banh mi bo kho (beef stew), its the best Ive had and none in Westminster or Santa Ana have come close.",

I had the tofu pho and the tofu was lightly fried just how I prefer:) the broth was amazing and it was a bigger building than most I've seen in Arizona. It's one of those \"hole in the wall\" type restaurants, but sometimes I think that's the best places for real authentic oriental food. I now come here at least 3 times a month ;)",

I was distracted by the ambiance. Old tiled floors. Really funny, faux velvet art deco chairs and tables that could have used a little Windex. We were greeted immediately, sat, received water and then...well...waited and waited. I didn't want to be to rude but finally flagged someone down.   You could tell this was a family run gig...dad type figure bussing tables, little kids running around with rice falling out of their mouths (seriously, it wasn't gross, but kinda sweet) and the big mama just kinda surveying the scene. Meanwhile the younger men ran the floor. Our order was finally taken and food was delivered swiftly. The spring rolls did not dissapoint....so fresh, so delicious...who needs a fried spring roll any more? The menu was so huge and intimidating I basically just pointed at something and blurted out the number.   Taking the safe route was kind of boring I realize but the noodles were yummy, the veggies crisp and the tofu was amazing. I watched the other patrons (i.e. anybody that wasn't white) to see what they ordered. It was Pho all around. Next time it's Pho for Pho sure!   Great experience. Would totally order a tray of those spring rolls for a party. And next time in addition to Pho I'll have Alexander C.'s fave Banh. He says it makes him horny you know!? Oh. The prices were unbelievably low! I could have paid the entire bill with change from the cracks of my sofa cushions.",

The food has without fail been good. The only bad experience I had was when I decided to be adventurous and try some unfamiliar authentic Vietnamese dishes. What can I say - some flavors don't translate across cultures...  The staff are nice, without being in your face friendly like at a American casual dining restaurant. Top recommendations - The Shrimp and Pork Spring rolls for a starter Either the Bun, or the lemon grass beef for a main dish. (As a fair warning to you, the lemon grass beef can have a high sodium content if you're sensitive to it)",

The pho has the best flavor around, the spring rolls are always delicious, the Vietnamese coffee will knock your socks off, and the BBQ pork is their specialty!  The BBQ pork is served many ways - w/ rice, on vermicelli, in sandwiches or spring rolls - don't miss it, it is absolutely the best thing on the menu!  The service is always fast and courteous, and the prices are unbelievably cheap for the quality.  LOVE this place!",

It's kind of in a ghetto area (no surprise!) and the inside is pretty bland like any authentic Asian restaurant worth their salt should be.  The food, however, was the exact opposite!  I ordered the #2, a big heaping bowl of pho complete with an assortment of meats, and we shared two orders of spring rolls (two in each order).  We were relieved that the orders came out quick, because the lot of us were thirsty and/or hungry, and we wanted to get down to business.  Both the pho and the spring rolls were equally as tasty.  Although I didn't finish the pho (strictly due to not being hungry enough to finish the whole thing), I was glad that my friends chose this place as our destination.  They also have banh mi (2.50 each...cheap!), which my friend said was also pretty good.  So you have your choice of noodles, sandwiches or rice dishes here.  Apparently they also serve boba drinks next door.  You can order the drinks at Da Vang and they'll bring them over to you, but if the boba place is closed, then you're out of luck (like we were, but I'm not gonna hold it against them).",

The grilled pork is more baked than grilled - no smokiness or tasty charred bits anywhere.  The pho tastes more of MSG than boiled beef bones.  And service is as bad as ever.  I wonder if Da Vang's popularity has led it to take shortcuts for efficiency.    Definitely not worth going out of your way for - go to Khai Hoan in Tempe for the smokey grilled pork or Saigon Nites in Scottsdale for the delicious pho instead.  Prior review:  Essential pre-eating check list for Da Vang  1.   Turn your expectation on service down to zero 2.   Voluntary separation of  restaurant decor & atmosphere from the dining experience 3.  Limited peripheral vision is a plus  Now you're ready to enjoy one of the tastiest Vietnamese place this side of San Jose.",

I know from past experiences that what was causing that was the use of MSG.  Again I really like this place, I wish they would stop using MSG and I would return in a heart beat. I know that they are not the only restaurant that uses MSG. But I also avoid other restaurants that use this artificial food contaminent. I hope Da Vang takes a moment and thinks about their health and the health of all of their customers and eliminates MSG.",

I got a lot of exercise in the last few days and my metabolism is feeling fast at the moment so I pigged out... a vietnamese bbq pork sandwich, which had greezy but good pork, jalapeno, carrot, bean sprouts, and cilantro,  and a crepe which was filled with bean sprouts, shrimp, and other tasty things. They bring tons of fresh herbs with your order.   Total bill: $14 and some change... for both of us.    Everything was fresh, the food came up fast despite the crowd, and I felt satisfied.

It is one of my favorite places to come to in the Valley because of the food, friendly service and all this for an affordable cost.  This is a True dive or hole in the wall for sure, but the food makes up for the lack in decor.  Besides the Pho, the Banh Xeo (Crepe) and rice dishes are very tasty as well.  You have to realize that the cost of gathering all the ingredients and cooking it yourself would usually be higher than coming to eat here for any meal.  And if you happen to see Banh Bao on the table in front, you have to try it.  They do not serve this daily which they should, but it is a white pastry filled with steamed barbeque pork and some hard boiled egg.  When you get it fresh, you'll thank me for tasting this hidden gem.  Hands down best in the valley and rivals those made in Little Saigon, California.   The ROA (Ratio of Authenticity) is usually 0.65-0.75. (# of Ethnic Patrons (Vietnamese in this case) / Total # of Patrons) at any given time which for me is pretty authentic for Phoenix.  I've been in other Vietnamese restaurants which were supposedly voted the best in the valley, but is horrible by VN standards.     I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the decor.",

The banh mi was perfect, just the right amount of meat to veggie ratio, but the spring rolls were just okay. Unfortunately, we came during Lunar New Year and the service left much to be desired.

Decided last week to give it another chance. Spring rolls were great, but that's about it. My pho tai was greasy, the meat was nasty and chewy, and I got sick from it later that night. My friend ordered veggie pho and the cabbage in it was rotten with black spots all over it. Her broth was greasy too and she got sick that night as well. Also, there are dead cockroaches in the bathroom light fixtures and traps behind the toilet. This place is NASTY!  There are so many better pho places in town. Don't do it, you'll get sick!",

So we had our lunch date there today. $3 shredded pork or BBQ pork sandwiches. The French bread is crunchy on the outside. They fill the sandwich with just the right amount of meat, a spear of cucumber, cilantro, shredded carrot and radish pickles. Sprinkle a little of the sauce mixture they give you and voila, a delicious sandwich that doesn't bust your wallet.  We also took home a BBQ Pork plate with steamed crab cake and shredded beef (beef and tripe combination). It was the same meats that were in the Banh Mi. The plate was $6.75. We also took home the Pho Tai ($4.25). They package the thinly sliced meat separately. They also have you bring home the rice noodles, bean sprouts, basil, lime, sliced onions and green onions separately. Oh, they give you jalapenos, too. At home, we heated up the soup, tossed in the beef and veggies and marveled at the aromatic broth. We will be  back ready to eat more. We saw a hor fun or stir fried wide rice noodle dish with tonnes of veggies and meats that we want to try. Oh, while I waited, I drank sweetened soyabean drink. It was to die for. I was so sad when it was all gone. Did you hear my teardrop falling? I love you, Honey. You know my love language is food.",

The combo pho, and flat rice noodle seafood dish. All of their spring rolls are fresh and made to order so the wrapping is still soft. I've also tried their rice plates and vermicelli. All were equally tasty. Whatever you get, you won't be disappointed. I always leave here satisfied and full. Probably would be coming here more often if I didnt live so far.",

    "text": "Cute family- owned and run joint in a non-descript strip mall. Lots of locals here. The food was good, the wait not so bad, the service was friendly, however the delivery was a little haphazard. Dishes came out as they were ready, so apps came after some entrees, one entree came out waaay before everyone else's, and a different server each time so no one knew if we had ordered these dishes or not, some were for other tables. No biggie, but still. They should know what dishes belong to what tables at least.  We ordered   Shrimp Spring Roll: (with and without pork) Not the most flavorful I have had, and the rice wrapper was a bit gummier than I like, filing was very dry- but the sauces were very flavorful (loved the peanut one) and livened them up a bit. I probably wouldn't order this again.  Eggroll: Enjoyed these - crunchy fried and good flavor, piping hot. We all liked this.  Ga Pho (Chicken): Extremely light broth- too light? a bit flavorless- but the noodles and veggies were very fresh and abundant. Piling on all the accoutrements helped- along with a solid dose of that chili paste! I guess I am used to a more assertive, saltier pho broth.  Garlic Noodles with Vegetables & Tofu (may have been named \"Stir Fry w Vegetables\" on menu): Ordered with thin rice noodles (I love your choice of noodle for every dish- egg or rice, thick or thin) and everyone LOVED it-  was really the star of the table along with the Banh Mi. Server came by after and recommended the thicker rice noodle with this dish- will do if I return :)  BBQ Pork Banh Mi: Absolute perfection. For $3.00, this is the best sandwich I've had in a long time. Tender, flavorful BBQ pork sliced thin, pickled carrots and fresh, crunchy veggies, excellent, flakey and tender french bread. Perfect balance, every bite divine. I would order this again in a  heartbeat.  Broken Rice with Beef and Pork: Very flavorful dish, pork pieces were very thin and fried- were these tendons or skin? Kinda weird, but the beef was nice, one bigger piece sliced and served atop the rice.  I'd be ever so grateful if you could click on useful, funny or cool if it applies. Happy Yelping!!",

The vietnamese coffee... so so good!  The vermicelli dish with pork and egg roll... delicious!  Da Vang is one of those ethnic restaurants where people of that ethnicity actually go there to eat.  I'm not saying that is a tell-tale sign of the quality and authenticity of the food here, but it's definitely a good thing!    Ok, that's all I got for you.

Vietnamese restaurants in more densely-Viet populated areas are known for specializing in specific items even though they may have a broader menu.  Therefore, I waited until after a few visits to write a review.   Da Vang wins easily over Pho Thanh, whose menu, price, and location I find comparable.  The pho broth is richer and less fatty.  The bbq pork (thit nuong) on vermicelli and rice dishes is much more authentic.  Their bo kho (beef stew) was very good and banh uot was also good.  I spotted some crispy banh xeo on other tables and I might want to try that next.    I think this will be my go to Viet spot in Phoenix.",

Like other reviewers said, \"it's a whole in the wall\" kind of place. But definitely worth to try!!!",

Walking in was a blast from the past, my family and I used to come here almost every Sunday before going to the Seafood market that is no longer there (I guess that's why we stop coming). The food is still as great as I remember it. The menu looks remarkably the same as Pho Thuan Thanh in Mesa.   Got the usual pho number 1 and added the usual basil, siracha, lime and jalapenos. Great flavors from the broth and well cooked noodles that combined to be a party in your mouth with ever bite and slurp. We also order 41. broken steam rice with bbq pork. The pork was tender and easy enough to cut with just the spoon and pouring the fish sauce over the meat and pork just gives the right sweet and savory to make you go into a food coma for a month. Not mentioning that the prices average about $6 a person, and you walk away be more full that you ever thought you could be.",

They took about 20min just to come back to take our orders and I get it busy, we went on Sunday and the place was pack but wouldn't it be faster for them if they had faster service. Then another 30-45min to bring our food we had asked for more water too and they brought the food but no water. We reminded the server but after the food was delivered we didn't see him again! He didn't came to check if everything was fine, he never delivered the water and we had to get up and asked for the check our selves. If the service would have been better I believe they would have gotten a 5 star in my book.",

Noodles are plentiful and filling. The only suggestion I would have is I wished the sliced eye of round was slightly thicker. The slices of beef here tend to be very thin to the point of shredding easy. Veggies are always fresh and plentiful also. The iced tea is also very good. The banh mi are a nice addition to a hot bowl of pho. After all...who doesn't like a good soup and sandwich? But I digress. The Banh Mi here is the perfect sized for sharing with an extra large bowl of pho. Meat is tender and flavorful, veggies crisp and fresh. I just wish the bread was a little heartier. Its not bad; however, its reminiscent of toasted wonder bread. I wish they used a True baguette. Though maybe I'm asking too much as I frequent this establishment often. Aside from these 2 small issues, I really can't fault them for anything else. There are quite a few pho spots around the area of 19th and Camelback but I feel like this one is the best!",

I love Pho and so I looked this place up in a Google search for top 10 pho places in Phoenix. This was a meet up lunch with my girlfriend and her toddler. Myself and my toddler arrived a little earlier we got a table, and I asked for a high chair. They brought the highchair (dirty with grime and sticky stuff all over) no big deal, I had disinfectant wipes. I cleaned it up and sat my kid in it. As I sat down myself, I realized my chair was wet. I immediately stood up and noticed there was a yellow urine like puddle under the table. I told the waiter staff and they just replaced my chair, claiming it was just water spilled. It def smelled bad and it was not water. Whatevs, I went into the restroom and wiped off whatever it was with soap off the back of my jeans. My girlfriend and her kid arrived so they asked for another highchair. Another dirty highchair was brought. I handed her the wipes and she did her thing. We ordered our food, which took a little while Pho Ga (chicken pho) and a sandwich for our kids to split. I tasted my Pho and it was descent, however before I could take a 2nd sip we looked over on the wall by our table and saw a cockroach just passing by like we were in his territory. This is when we got up and walked to the cashier and told them what's up. They thought we were lying or something. I walked them over and pointed at the cockroach. At this point they just started cleaning up the table and muttering something under their breath. That's cool. I walked back to the cashier and his response was \"Don't worry it's on me\"  .....I paused with silence and had to make sure there were no one jumping out with cameras telling me I was on an episode of some sort of disgusting restaurant joke. The most horrible restaurant experience ever.",

Also, its location is nice because there isn't a ton that I've tried in the area that isn't chain-oriented. I appreciate that it's family-owned and operated.  I got the buon thiao nuang cuon-barbeque pork and noodles. The pork was marinated well and tasty. The egg rolls are small, but the spring rolls are fresh and pretty fantastic. Their version of the peanut sauce is more like hoisin and their noodles are pretty standard. All in all, I would definitely come back for a quick and easy meal!",

If it is your first time at Da Vang - I suggest the Ph or Bun Ch Gio Tht Nng are your best bets.   I love coming to Da Vang on Saturday to get a warm cup of freshly brew soy milk (sa u nanh) and pork buns (banh bao) - in the morning these two are the best combo.  For coffe lovers- try the Viet coffee - it's brew French style =)   Do not come to Da Vang expecting a clean restaurant and good service- because you will be very disappointed .  most people there are regulars and can take jokes from the guys waiting on them; however, they are much nicer to the foreigners ;)",

    "text": "There are a couple of things you have to realize about Da Vang. It's worth the 4 stars, but a lot of the traditional things that you'd expect from a regular restaurant you can't from this place.  First off, it's been here forever. I've been coming here since I've been like 12. It is, IMO, one of the BEST Vietnamese restaurants here in Phoenix. Like all good Vietnamese restaurants, it is in the hood. It is also old, and grungy, and the service is not always on point. (I actually find that the service is usually better than some other Asian places. Some in Cali are truly AWFUL.) It is, in my opinion, usually brisk, to the point, and gets things done. I don't often have to wait for my water to be filled or feel like I've been ignored when it comes to being seated. But they're not smiling at you making conversation about how your mani-pedi just went. This isn't that kind of place. Same with the facilities. It's not disgusting. The bathrooms are clean and dry, there's always tons of TP and soap and it doesn't smell. But there are cleaner, newer places around. If that icks you out, go find one of those nice new Pho places in Scottsdale. This place isn't for you.  The food is, in general, outstanding. It's got one of the best ranges of Vietnamese food that I've seen. Most places just serve Pho, and that's it. But they have amazing beef stew, bun rieu, banh mi... I checked out their banh xeo here after my vietmanese coworker said that's his favorite thing, and it's the best I've had so far. So crispy it shatters, with tons of flavor in the dip and great toppings. My husband always has to take away their liver spread banh mi after we've come here. Their spring rolls are fresh. And it's all cheap. We can get an appetizer, drinks, dessert, noodles, and banh mi to go for $35, including tax and tip. The only dud for me was the bun bo hue. Bland and disappointing, there are places that make it better.   And the proof is in the pudding. This place is almost always busy. I get my food quickly, it's hot and good, and you get taken care of well. If that's all you need, then this is your place for Vietnamese food. If you need cute decor, spick and span facilities and wait staff that all speak great english... then pass.",

So many nice things have  been said about Da Vang in other reviews, so I won't repeat the details, except that it is good, fresh, and cheap.  Every time, without fail.  I've been there often, and just realized today that I hadn't reviewed it.  Atmosphere?  It's a room with some tables, no frills, but who cares?  Service is purely functional, no chit-chat or pleasantries - fine with me.  Bring on the pho, or rice stick noodles or stew, or .....drum roll please... the rice soup with fish.  That's menu item 61B.  They use lemon grass in it, and must put in a pound of lovely, perfectly cooked cod.  It's heavenly, and takes a little longer than most items to make so be prepared.",

    "text": "Oh my, I truly hate to do this, but my visit to Da Vang was horrid! After reading all the lovely reviews I was so excited to take my husband and child to a place near our new digs, to prove that we hadn't moved far away from good food experiences. We knew that the outside was a strip mall locale, we don't care. We knew the inside was going to look like it did, we don't care. We go to places because of food, service and price.   When we went they were working on the one entrance so we entered on the far side. There were two people eating and a few children running about playing. My first thought was great, this is a friendly, family place and light crowd would mean attentive service. We didn't know if we should seat ourselves, so we walked to the silverware table where we saw menu's and stood for a moment.  Three times servers walked right past us and ignored our presence. Other workers were in the kitchen area, but no one noticed us.   I whispered, \"Maybe we should get menus and just sit down?\" So we took three menu's and as I turned around one of the servers came up and made motion for us to sit right there at this huge circle table.  A very large table, but we slid into the corner and he took drink orders from us then dissappeared.  We sat. We sat some more. He walked by twice carrying water. Another server walked by twice, once with food, once with dishes. They greeted two more tables and brought them menus and took their orders. A server came and poured three water glasses for our table and I interrupted him asking about our drink order. He said something I didn't understand and turned away.  We sat.   Finally I said, \"Excuse me, please...\" I got the attention of a different server and we asked about our drink order which he took again and we didn't want to wait any longer and gave our food order as well. Just in case they'd never come back. I told the server we were new to this cuisine and would need some help. My husband just wanted to leave. I coerced him to stay, it's going to be fabulous Pho I said remembering the wonderful Yelp reviews. The food would soothe him. I smiled smugly. We ordered several dishes all recommended in Yelp reviews. Spring rolls, two Pho's and the Ban Xeo for my egg and shrimp loving child.  15 minutes later two drinks and some plates of leaves and garnishes were placed on the table. No drink for me and no way to get the garnish plate persons attention. We sat. \"Are we supposed to eat these,\" asked my husband?  I said , \"I believe they go in the soup when it comes.\" But after another 15 minutes of nothing else arriving, he started to make a mini salad. Several more tables had come in, everyone else had their food. The two tables who came after us were finishing up.  \"This is Bullshit, \" I muttered to my husband, and just then the crepe and the Pho's came out. I was starting to see a trend here. Just when you get to the point where you want to leave they finally do something to make you stay. We were starving and we didn't want to drive around for another place, just eat and go at this point. It was getting late. I hadn't eaten my garnishes so I shared them with my husband. My daughter's crepe was extra crispy bordering on too dark and she didn't know how to eat it, so she sort of plucked the little shrimps she found out of it.  \"It's not egg mom\", she said all grumbly. \"It's Vietmanese egg I said, \" as if I knew.   \"Well then I don't like Vietmanese food.\" Sigh. Maybe she would like and try the spring roll? Or some of my soup? The sping roll, one nibble. She didn't appreciate it, which was ok with me becuase I loved them.My husbands Pho was full of fatty gristle meat and he w/couldn't eat any of it.  My Pho was wonderful! My garnishes made it very tasty.   So I fed my daughter some Pho, but she wasn't too fond of that either.  The only real consolation was the price. It cost about $25 for everything we got and everything we didn't.  Maybe I can get someone from Yelp who loves Da Vang to come with us next time and show us how the experience is SUPPOSED to be, becuase I can't imagine this is what people are raving over. Sorry. They get two stars for having a low price and food *I* liked, but I can't give them any more than that.",

Not happy they use MSG, but my body didn't react to it as it normally does so I wonder if they really do. I got pho with chicken stuff in it. It was a bit too authentic for me, to be honest. I haven't decided if I'll go back yet, because I don't know jack squat about Vietnamese food and it was hard deciding on what to pick other than the spring rolls, considering the effort it took me to get there. It's a walk of about 3 blocks from the Camelback-19th Ave train station, which as I like to say is something I don't recommend at night in this part of town unless you're Chuck Norris. The service was really friendly and I enjoyed the fact that it was packed with Vietnamese customers, family and friends. A fun cultural experience but just not sure if I'll return for the food.",

Da Vang would complete favorably with most of the hole in the walls in Little Saigon.  The shrimp spring rolls are fantastic starters, the soups are all great, and the seafood dishes are well prepared.  The only negative I had was with the baguette sandwiches where the bread tends to be dry and the bbq fillings overly sweet.  The place is a hole in the wall, so don't expect ambiance, since there isn't any.  I have had no problems with service, and I have probably eaten her 10-12 times.",

I got the Pho 1 with the Beef, Tendon, Tripe. This was just like being back at home where there is a Pho shop on prety much every corner. I ended uip going back a few days later and getting a Banh Mi (gread BBQ pork sandwich) which was the best I'd ever had, along with a few appetizers. The fresh spring rolls were gret, and just over 2 bucks. We also got the BBQ pork appetizer with Rice Paper which was nice, we caould make our own spring rolls. Wifey chickedned out and got fried rice, which wasn't very good.  overll, this place rocks.",

Some places I go to come out in a heart beat and the wrapper is always hard, you can tell it's been sitting in the fridge.  I also would recommend their BBQ beef or Pork with rice, marinated so deliciously!! Add a fried egg on top for an extra charge but so worth it =) ALL of their Banh Mi (vietnamese sandwiches are great! Their vietnamese iced coffee is as strong as I want coffee to be so yummy with condensed milk! Go give it a shot! Don't expect the best service here, but the food makes up- for it!

    "text": "Coming from LA to visit Phoenix, I wanted to try the local Pho.  I have eaten at numerous Pho places in Los Angeles area and was dying to hear what all the rave was about.  I picked \"DA VANG\" because of the great reviews.  All i have to say was that this placed literally sucked.  The service was horrible. The waiters took our order then took almost 20 mins to get our food. I don't know if they cared that their customers came to eat and were hungry.  Second, the food that arrived was overcooked. The meat was hard, the beef tendons were obviously old and the soup was too sweet.  Overall, if you want pho, try some other place. If you're in Los angeles, I can recommend tons of great places that are fraction of the price with great service.    Overall, Da Vang was a horrible experience, overpriced, bad food, bad experience. I will never go back to this place.",

I will stick with the few veggie options provided, which are delicious, ridiculously cheap, and easily enough for two meals.",

Their order of spring roll with egg and pork are two for $2.50. Their Egg Sandwich with two sunny side up and Asian pickles are $2.50. Most their noddle dishes are around $5. I usually get two appetizers with one entree for about $10 or so. If you feel trying something adventurous, they also have some authentic exciting items such as duck with sour bamboo soup and such.   They are very good at accommodating your needs. My vegetarian friend got her Tofu Egg Roll and Veggie Pho was super pleased and has visited the place many times since then all the way from Tempe.   I just want to say this place is truly un\"PHO\"gettable~",

People needs to know that you pay at the cash register on your way out which was the way they done it in Asia.  This establishment is time tested and is here to stay for good.

On his 3rd or 4th time eating there, he convinced me to order take-out. Normally, it  hadn't taken long to get his food in the past but this time, we sat in the parking lot for over a half hour. Apparently, everyone had to wait awhile. I ordered the chicken/shrimp fried rice that was extremely flavorless and dry. So disappointing as I haven't had a good fried rice in awhile. My husband ordered banh-mi, spring rolls and another app that you basically put together (pork, vermicelli noodles, lettuce). I loved the banh-mi which was a sandwhich on a type of hoagie roll with pork, mayo, shredded carrot, cucumber and peppers. I was so surprised at how much I loved the sandwhich. The sandwiches are $2.25 and our whole bill was approx $17. I didn't exactly enjoy my meal but I think this place is definitely worth a try. Everyone has their off nights, right?",

The #50 deep fried egg rolls are good and the BBQ pork spring rolls are very tasty. Occasionally I get the coffee with cream - I think it's much better than any of the chain coffee places. The banh mi used to have amazing, flaky French bread and now it's just okay. But the BBQ pork #75 with fish sauce, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha is still yummy to the tummy.  There is no decor. The service can be trying but it has gotten better in the last year or so. Twice in about 50 times have they forgotten my order. You just have to be aware and speak up when something isn't right.

The bread seemed like it was cut from a cheap grocery store French bread, the veggies weren't properly pickled, and it was just.....boring. The pork was tasty, but I asked for BBQ pork and I'm pretty sure that was lemongrass grilled pork. Finally, the steamed ground pork bun was a little off. Not sure how else to describe it.

    "text": "AMBIANCE: I am a big fan of Vietnamese food, but have avoided coming to this place because people kept saying it's a dive. Well, when I arrived, I didn't think it was any more divey than most of the outdated, awful Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. I walked out of Pho House on McDowell because it was \"divey\" and there was practically no one in there, but then again, that is a newer restaurant. This one was packed, however. The restaurant was open and bright and coming in from triple digit heat, well-air conditioned. So, the ambiance was quite comfortable. Later, it became almost too cold, but going back outside was nice.  FOOD: We started out with crispy egg rolls, which were crunchy, hot and delicious, and the shrimp spring rolls, which were loaded with cooked, cold rice noodles, veggies, and shrimp wrapped in a delicate, thin soft rice paper. We also got an appetizer (don't remember name) that looked like dolmas, cooked pork in grape leaves, that you build yourself into a roll by wetting the rice paper and loading with the fresh vegetables. Btw, I love that you get so much lettuce, mint, seasoned vermicelli noodles, cucumbers, etc. to add to whatever you get...very nice. And don't forget to add the fish sauce and any of the multitude of other sweet, savory, and spicy sauces and pastes, Sriracha included. I had the #39, which is broken rice with BBQ pork, shrimp cake, a couple cooked shrimp, meatball, and fried egg. I wanted a mixture of different things and this dish delivered. My only complaint would be that the individual shrimps were way overcooked, but this didn't ruin my experience because everything else just shined in a major way.   SERVICE: It is apparent that everything is cooked to order and not just dumped from a can or stir fried from a frozen bag. Therefore, not all your dishes may come out at the same time. In fact, I really enjoyed the staggering of appetizers so that I could enjoy each one individually. But the service is efficient and always moving amongst an almost packed restaurant of tables. The server that took our order was very friendly and was able to recommend dishes and another server was able to help me identify something on another table that looked very good (the pork ribs, which I will try next time).  In conclusion, thanks to my friends for encouraging me to finally try this place. The prices are extremely reasonable, so I don't care if they don't have fresh paint, music, or whatever to entice me because the food is the star attraction and what my senses are tuned into here. The ingredients are fresh, there are a ton of Asians, and it's just a good time. I will certainly be back for lunch or dinner and definitely will try the pho when I crave a hot soup. I'm not sure if I will try the other Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix. I've already been to Rice Paper, which was just okay, but sometimes having something to compare to is good. But then again, when you find something amazing that you like, it's just a waste of time and money to try something else that may disappoint.",

It is also very inexpensive at only around $4.50 for a decent sized bowl! The veggies for your soup also comes in generous servings!  If you love Pho, but have not tried this place, you must!",

    "text": "To be fair, Vietnamese food isn't high on my list of must-haves.  In fact, every time I go there, before I even open my mouth to speak, the staff lets me know whether they have French bread for sandwiches, because I apparently order them all the time  (and didn't realize it till they said so).  Vietnamese food is overweighted towards soup and I'm not a huge soup fan.  I'm especially not a huge fan of this place's soups:  either a clear broth loaded down with noodles or something oily and heavy.  The Mi Xao Don and Mi Xao Men are the closest things to stir fry, but come with either fried noodles or actual noodles instead of rice.  But it makes no difference:  it's watery and heavy on basic vegetables with little real meat.  Most of the other \"main\" dishes are rice-heavy.  But this isn't the restaurant's fault:  if you know Vietnamese food, then you know Vietnamese food means \"rice and ...\"  or \"soup\"  (Pho).  Now, let's go to what this uncultured Westerner DOES like:    The sandwiches are to DIE for:  simple, sandwich sized French bread stuffed with jalapenos, cucumber, pate, mint and mayo.  Or maybe one with an omelette.  There are a number of different sandwiches and while the two I mention above are my favorite, any of the others will hardly disappoint.  The spring rolls are always fresh and crisp; the egg roll is more like a Chinese \"spring roll\"  (while the Vietnamese spring roll is nothing like you've had before:  lettuce and shrimp --- or pork --- wrapped in rice paper ... I call them \"alien rolls\")..  The egg roll usually comes VERY hot, so be careful.  Wrap it up in a lettuce leaf before eating, like the Vietnamese do and find yourself surprised at how well those go together!  As far as beverages go, I can't stress how good their \"Thai Tea\"s are.  Easily as good as in any Thai place and priced unbeatably low.  In fact, this restaurant has two things going for it:  very low priced, but very authentic food and, of course, being low priced, it's a good value.  When you see that a large percentage of the clientele eating here is Vietnamese, that should be a clue as to what their own people think of the food.  Now, one must have a bit of a strong stomach to eat here.  It's not the cleanest of places; very basic furniture and fixtures, and the tables so close together as to make the dining experience almost communal  (Ho Chi Minh would have been proud of this Socialist experiment in seating).  Kids are frequently here and frequently loud.  Apparently, there's an unwritten rule, that any visit to this Vietnamese restaurant must have children under two in attendance and they must scream or at least throw noodles on the floor.  You've been warned:  don't show up here in a formal gown and leave one star, because you didn't realize you'd be eating in what can best be described as a former electronics store after all its furniture's been repossessed.  And just so you know, that other loud \"noise\" you hear is the wait staff screaming at each other in Vietnamese like hot dog sellers in a stadium.  Don't worry:  eventually, you'll be too distracted trying to figure out what that food is in front of you to notice it at all.  Overall, despite the negative sounding review, good food if you like Vietnamese; not good at all if you're expecting something similar to Thai or Chinese  (not even close).  Helpful staff  (though one time, I sat for 50 minutes while my partner ate only to be told they forgot I ordered a sandwich).  Dinner for two rarely hits about $25 and we're talking a LOT of food for that.  Cleanliness could be better, but we're not talking about a street stall in downtown Saigon with mopeds racing by.  Oh, and as long as we're on the subject of vehicles:  be prepared for an overcrowded parking lot with unusual parking.  Apparently, some Vietnamese believe that parking in the lines  (or on the street, for that matter) is optional.  Oh, and one other warning:  they tend to close early (8pm) most nights, so don't dilly dally putting on your stockings.  The traffic on I-17 getting there can be murder.",

Large authentic Vietnamese menu, smiling faces for service, FAST SERVICE, EXCELLENT ON POINT CUISINE, and excellent excellent excellent pricing. Makes me wish this place was right next door! I would be coming more often. Probably every day or other day at that. The herbs were fresh and aplenty, and the condiment to-go station was well organized to do it yourself. Great dessert options for authentic Vietnamese choices. Apparently, my girlfriend tells me this area is Vietnamese-ville? I don't know, but the prices for great Vietnamese food in Tempe and Scottsdale is WAYYY more... and the menus in these cities I've found don't even touch the menu that is offered here. Here, its way more extensive. Two appetizers, and two main dishes was $21. There was take home too! OH YUMMM! BTW growing up being \"Asian\" myself, and eating authentic pho every week in China Town Honolulu makes me a good judge of good Vietnamese food... ;)",

    "text": "I love Pho. Yes I pronounce it right. \"F-UH\" I have been an aPhocianado for quite a while. In Vancouver, I lived near Kingsway aka Pho-alley where it was like little Vietnam: Starbucks: 0.  Pho places: a plethura. Some even right next to each other 'cuz like any good Pho lover knows each shop has its own broth style. I can't say that Da Vang is the best I've ever had, because it's not. I can say that I have been there about a dozen times because it's good and consistent. Great prices, good selection for the more adventurous and it's always really busy with Asians of all ilks including Vietnamese (good sign) and everyone else. That isn't due to it being a tiny hole-in-the-wall: it's huge inside. Busy=high turn-over which means fresh food. Now it has all of the typical elements one comes to expect in a Pho place: emotionless but prompt service, divey atmosphere and horrible bathrooms; all fine by mean as long as the pho pleases. It does at Da Vang.  I'm always suspicious of any pho place that's quiet, super clean and empty. Give me busy and a tad gross any day.  My wife and I were brought that much closer together thanks to our mutual love of this delicious soup. We often had Pho for breakfast when we were first dating. Any woman willing to have pho as a cornerstone to a scrumptious breakfast rates highly in my book! If you're new to Phoenix and need a little comPHOrt, look no further than Da Vang!",

Let me clear this up first. When I say that I'm a Vietnamese food nut I am not joking. I used to eat Vietnamese two or three times a week, there were eight (!) Vietnamese restaurants within a block of my house back home, my best friend is Vietnamese and his mother and sister cook for me when I go back for a visit. I know my Bun from my Banh, Pho realz.  Let's start with the good. The Bun was indeed tasty, well prepared and inexpensive like Bun should be.  Now for the bad. The service was terrible, they were out of bbq pork, they mixed up the salt and sugar in my drink (a briny drink is not where it's at, fyi) and their Banh Xeo was an abomination that likely would have begged for death if it could speak.  I wish that I could say that I had found my Vietnamese oasis in the dull and bland desert but I have not. My search continues and so should yours.",

I'm sorry, but this place is sad!  I hate giving 2 star ratings especially if it's a family owned business, but their service needs improvement!  When we sat down, nobody bothered to check on us or even offer us water.  After waiting and being ignored for about 5 minutes, we finally waved someone to give us water . Our waiter seemed a little impatient and when we ordered our drinks, the server just threw our beverages on the table, turned around and then walked away.  We were like, what is his problem? Maybe he had a long day, but that's no excuse!  When he finally took our order, half of the things I ordered weren't available. He kept saying they ran out and he seemed very short with me. Then why put 100 items in the menu if half of the items are not available? I am always nice to service industry, but this dude didn't even bother suggesting an alternate selection. Sage ordered a beef pho and I ordered a vegetarian noodle with tofu and vegetables. This place is not vegan friendly and all their pho is made with beef stock. Most of their dishes either contains animal tendons, pigs blood, tripe and other things i couldn't identify.    Then when we got our food, he didn't even bother to check on us to see if everything was satisfactory.  I don't know why this place get 5 stars. It's not even a 5 star restaurant. It's in a sketchy strip mall and the restaurant is dirty. Stained ceilings and filthy floors. I would be scared to find out what the kitchen looks like.  Sure you get good value for your money and they give you large portions, but the service and atmosphere left much to be desired.",

I'd much rather have fair prices and good food in a less than stellar environment.  Plus if you've actually been to Vietnam, you'd realize the grungier the place,the more authentic it is, but I digress.   Prices are cheap, really cheap. My wife ordered an egg noodle duck soup and I had a combination broken rice plate. My wife complained about the broth being a bit bland (but she always does, and restaurant soup broths are never as good as a homemade) but it was still very tasty. My broken rice dish (com) came with shredded pork, grilled pork, shrimp balls, egg cage and an egg over easy. While it wasn't quiet as good as I've had in Little Saigon in Garden Grove, CA it was still very tasty.  Lastly the staff were all very friendly and attentive ( a rarity in our experience with Vietnamese owned restaurants)",

    "text": "Unbelievably delicious food at very good prices. I can't even remember the last time I was able to get a great, filling meal for $6-7 and here, you truly can. The pho is a consensus Phoenix favorite and has gotten many good reviews from the Phoenix New Times and Yelpers alike, and for good reason. Pho places are really trendy right now, and popping up all over the place, but this one has been here forever and been making top notch pho the whole time.  If you typically get your pho from more anglicized places like Rice Paper and unPhogettable, try Da Vang. If you're used to having to use the usual pho fixings (sriracha, hoisin, jalapenos, etc.) to get flavorful broth, TRY DA VANG. The broth is extremely flavorful on its own, and in my view, really doesn't need any modification (though the usual fixings are provided). The Bahn Mi and spring rolls are also very tasty, even if not the best I've ever had. Solid Vietnamese coffee.  Now for the bad: service could be better. It may also depend on when you eat there, but I've been there several times where they didn't really check up on us, took a very long time to take our orders, or brought out our dishes at completely different times (not too fun for my friend, who had to watch me eat for 15 minutes before her food reached the table). Oddly enough, I found this was more True when the place was less busy for whatever reason. Also, if you or anyone in your party is vegetarian, you'll probably want to go somewhere else. Da Vang has a gigantic, hulking behemoth of a menu which has a grand total of 2 vegetarian items on it, and both are stir fry style dishes (no vegetarian pho). My friend found this out the hard way.  While we're on the topic of the menu, it's a little overwhelming and really could use some paring down. Years ago, having a huge menu may have appealed to people, but when you make certain items extremely well (see above), I think you're better off consolidating a bit and focusing on them. Personally, I almost always get pho, bahn mi, or spring rolls, and those seem to be the consensus strongest options.  Finally, yes, this place is dingy and perhaps somewhat sketchy-looking. The decor could use an update. None of that bothers me even slightly, but if you think it'd bother you, you may want to go somewhere else. Personally, I'll sit at tacky booths all day long if it keeps the pho under $6.",

The dish was good but the service was slow, especially since I came here mid-afternoon, way after the lunch rush was over. So next time I need my Vietnamese food fix and it's a day other than Tuesday, I'll be headed for the nearby  Pho Thanh; for me, it has better food,  faster service, and more generous portions.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday around 4pm. There wasn't any wait, due to the random time, but I'd say about half the tables inside were still taken. I came for one reason, and one reason only - a Banh Mi.  Quick story: about a year or two ago, someone brought some Banh Mi's in to work, and I was so put off by the way they looked (mushy, soggy, messy, funky smelling), that I never EVER wanted to try one. Fast forward to 2018, and another co-worker was telling me about how amazing they are. It took me some time, but I eventually came around.  So there I am, driving around in the middle of Phoenix, dead set on trying a Banh Mi. I did my research, I did my comparisons, and everything led me to Da Vang. The space is by no means \"nice\". If anything, it just seems like a typical hole-in-the-wall type of Asian restaurant, which I have no issue with. I had high expectations for this meal, and I was not let down. I got the spring rolls to start off, and everything about it was good. I can't explain what puts a spring roll high on my list, but this one is up there. Finally....the Banh Mi. I got the BBQ pork sandwich, and I ate every. single. crumb. I couldn't believe I spent the last two years in ignorance. Prices seem to be very very decent here ($3.75 for the sandwich?!)  Anyways. Highly recommend Da Vang based off my first Banh Mi experience. I'd definitely come back to try some of the other menu items, all of which looked delicious.",

It's gone by the end of the day. The guy only makes one batch a day and if it's gone it's gone. The bread is a tapioca bread with coconut flavoring. Maybe pandan?  Pho is hot and ready. Probably one of the better places in Phoenix. Can't go wrong there.  Spring rolls. Fresh. Has shrimp and pork. Their sauce isn't THAT special though. But still good.  Their sandwiches are a good price for a sandwich. They have different types from BBQ pork, deli cut, and eggs.  They have rice plates (broken rice). Can't go wrong. Recommend the chicken one.  Their desserts are awesome. I recommend the 3 color dessert if you're adventurous. They have coconut jello that is very refreshing.  Always my to go place when I need Vietnamese food!",

The food came out in less than 10mins and were delicious! It definitely assuage my craving for decent viet food! I'm just a tad disappointed about the fish sauce that accompanied the dish--it was too watery/sweet. It needed more fish sauce to be honest but otherwise it hit the spot!",

Was not very impressed with my first visit but thought we should give it another try after a recommendation from a friend, and we were passing by it.  Why 2 stars? Service: 2 stars. We got seated right away and even though they were fairly busy on a Sunday after church, we got our order quickly but didn't see our waiter after that.  I got the Bun Bo Hue. I am a mission to find a place that would offer that authentic taste that I missed. While it comes pretty close by having the blood pudding and the ham hock in the broth, the meat didn't taste fresh but like old, freezer burned. Did not offer the shredded banana blossom as side condiment. So this gets 3 star  Husband ordered the \"lemongrass\" chicken. Not at all authentic, and again, the chicken itself tasted old, like it was re-heated one too many time. The flavor was like bland and barely had any lemongrass flavor with some yellowish sauce. So this gets 0 star. So bad that he had to order pho.  Pho Dac biet was good, probably the best out of the 3 dishes according to husband. So this gets 4 stars.",

The menu was mostly indecipherable. You could make out words like beef and chicken, and a number by the food.  Ordering consisted of you telling them a number, and then them repeating back the entree name in perfect Vietnamese like they're better than you.  The food was delicious, the cuts of meat were premium and the Vietnamese iced coffee came out unmixed. Meaning you had to mix the drip coffee into the condensed milk.  After we were done instead of using and iPad or register. This fuckboy used a TI-84 calculator to split up me and my buddy's tab. I left a 30 percent tip, but he was unwaivered in his misery. 10 out of 10 will put up with hot girl bullshit again.",

Some of the best most flavorful pho I've had and ridiculously cheap. Got the Pho Tai (A2) and my total was $6 out the door!? Only bad part was the parking, I had to park down the street in a residential area and walk over. A little annoying, but you never want to go somewhere that's not crowded right?

It is easy to see why it is a favorite (Restaurant was packed at Noon on a Wednesday) as it is just a nice \"bowl of love,\" at an amazing price ($4.50) but was not nearly as memorable as my Phavorite Pho Places and not what I am looking for in Phlavorful Pho.

I don't know how they get pass the health inspection. They seem to never clean their things. I found some dirty marks on my plates and my utensils. One word. Disgusting! Who would want to be at an unhealthy and unsanitary restaurants? I know I don't. I got one of the employee to change my utensils. They seemed to rolled their eyes just because I had them to change them. While they walk away, they probably think that I did not understand Vietnamese. Just because I'm Asian, that does not mean that I don't know any other dialect besides Cantonese or Mandarin. They were talking crap about me. They said that I was annoying and I took up their time up for getting me another utensils?! Really? Seriously?  Second thing I want to talk about is their food. Da Vang's meals are not as good as the past anymore. I have no idea what they have done to it. Their food are really cheap but are not worth it. I rather go to someone else to spend a little more money for great food, great service, and great sanitation than be at Da Vang..",

However, an older co-worker once taught me, \"You can't EAT atmosphere\".  Service? Not rude, just efficient...in perhaps a German sort of manner. I've had up to 4 or 5 staff(family, hangers-on?) taking care of us on any ONE visit. From bring out the appetizers, condiments, main course, cleaning off empties, etc. Very, very efficient.  It is a frequent stop, for sure.   The only thing I will say about the food is to echo the young lady in Vancouver who misses this place. Spread your 'pho wings' a bit and get the pho bo kho. It's got a tomato base in the broth, a bit thicker, and normally comes with thick, chewy rice noodles. You can ask for regular pho noodle, however. It's spicier, and has more meat than traditional pho. Tender chucks of beef shank, mostly. They consider it more of a stew, although not in the thick, 'gravy' texture of our yankee stews.",

The service is very laid back, they service a high number of people most days that I go so it's understandable they're very busy. Oh and they have super reasonable prices on their items and drinks.

The places that look like their housing criminals but you can't help but forgive it because the food is oh-so-good.    Too bad Da Vang wasn't like that.  The table wasn't cleaned properly and there were what looked like dried hoi sin sauce on the table.  I had to go through 3 spoons before I found one that didn't have dried food particles clinging to it and then another 5 to find a clean one for my girlfriend.  That is just completely wrong.  Utensils should be clean-not having the last guy's lunch still clinging to it!  I was really hoping the food was good.  I told myself if the food was good I can live with it.  The portion was freaking huge on the XL special pho bowl but half way through the meal I realized it was mostly noodles.  The meat was less than most places and the broth was only so-so in taste.

Just \"you don't want to wait?\" No, after nearly an hour for lunch with my food nowhere in site, no I don't want to wait.  Off we went to our next stop, with me at Panda while the girls shopped.

I'm not sure why since I didn't think Phoenix had a particularly populous Vietnamese community.  The broth is light, clean, and can be on the fatty side but it don't matter when the broth tastes this amazinggggg.  The cuts of raw and cooked beef are always tender and never stringy or tough.  Also good are their spring rolls, egg rolls, egg noodle with shrimp and pork (#22), and bahn mi. I personally loooove the BBQ pork, those baguettes ain't no joke. The worst thing is when you eagerly bite into a bahn mi only to CUT YOUR MOUTH ON ITS ROUGH EDGES.  Don't worry about that here, the bread is soft, chewy and delightful.  The waiters are super nice and friendly, you'll basically be served by the same people every time you go, which gives this no frills, all-about-the-food joint a familiar, comfortable atmosphere.

    "text": "Oh Da Vang, you are fabulous! I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I always seemed to go on the day they are closed. Anyway, I finally made it there to get some pho to go. I ordered pho ga over the phone and went to pick it up. Unfortunately, when I got there they told me they were out of chicken. Sad day. Anyway, I ended up getting some kind of beef and only waited a couple minutes for them to prepare it. The pho cost less than 5$ and when they handed me the package, it was huge! It had every item in separate containers and everything was so fresh. The beef came raw but quickly cooked in the broth (which must have been crazy hot because it was still nearly boiling when I got home). The pho was the best tasting pho I've had in Phoenix. None of that Americanized flavorless stuff you get at other places in town.  I will certainly be back!",

I always order pho tai and add lots and lots of Thai basil and chile paste and oil. Mmhmm! Now I know I'm Mexican, and my go to hangover cure should be menudo, but... Man pho is just as good if not better. And I love that this place opens at 8am! Not that I'd ever be up that early with a hangover. But I'm a sucker for a warm bowl of steamy noodles anytime, and even more so when I feel like ass.  This particular bowl of pho is very consistent. The only thing I don't like about this place is that the service hasn't always been the best, and the place feels dirty on a regular basis. I do love that this place is a really inexpensive bowl of pho. In times when I am not at my richest I can grab a bowl of pho and be full the entire day. That's the best. The child really likes the bahn mi here as well so that is a bonus.",

Parking was in a private lot and there were a few spaces. We walk in and the restaurant was big and packed too but we were acknowledged right away. I gave two fingers to the host and she says, \"wait one minute.\" I find it hilarious that this statement could come off rude in which I kind of took it that way. Eh, whatever.   So we get a table and we order vermicelli bowls - one with bbq pork and eggrolls and one with bbq shrimp. When we got the food, the bowls are slightly smaller than Pho Thanh. The flavor was fine. I was starving so I left nothing in my bowl. Server wasn't attentive, he placed our order, gave our check and that was it.  We paid - $15 excluding tip. I prefer my first choice than here but it is a good alternative for Vietnamese food in the area.",

I decided it was worth a try with all the good reviews. It is in a terrible area located in a very shady strip mall, but many times the hole in the wall places have good food so that didn't detour me at all. When we walked in the dingy place the woman at the counter didn't even bother to look up from counting her receipts and money to greet us in any way. We stood there waiting to see a menu, offered a seat or just a simple hello. She finally did look up and did me a favor to hand me a menu but never said I could have a seat just let me stand there to look at the menu. Very rude. A waiter eventually walked over and told us to have a seat and gave us water since we ordered a steam bun as we waited which tasted okay and he took our to go order. We got our food, took it home when I opened it up I was surprised that the \"shrimp\" in the vermicelli dish was actually shrimp or fish cake not real shrimp. I've never had greasier Vietnamese food ever! I have had this type of food many times at various restaurants and this is by far the GREASIEST! So gross, I tried to give it a chance but you can literally taste the grease on your lips with each bite. There where hard crunchy pieces in some of the chicken maybe bone?  I don't know where the 4 stars come from but this was the worst Vietnamese food, it was not light or flavorful. I gave it to my dogs because we could not stomach it.  This place is as awful as it looks.",

I ordered the bun rieu (noodle crab soup) and my mom ordered banh hoi chao tom thit nuong (thin noodles wrap with fried shrimp ham and bbq pork). The bun rieu was good. It got mince crab/pork with blended eggs, pigs hocks, porks blood, and the one thing I never had it with bun rieu before is the red bbq pork. It was very authentic, but I honestly don't prefer the red bbq pork in there, because it was meaty. The banh hoi chao tom thit nuong was delicious. You just have to wrap your own spring rolls and dip into the fish sauce they made.  Service and food was great, but I wish they would clean more or update tables and chairs. I would recommend this place if someone look for authentic food and fast service.",

My gf ordered the pork bun bowl & I ordered the vegetarian bun bowl w/Tofu. Man it was not only delicious but also huge & arrived very fast! If you're hungry this is definitely the place to go. I could barely finish my meal. The cost is very inexpensive and you can tell a place is legit by those who patronize it. I noticed alot of vietnamese patrons were dining here the evening we went, a very good sign! Definitely will return to this establishment and try other things off the menu next time around.",

When we explained to them that we had a lot of people, and requested if we could have one of the bigger, unoccupied tables, they rudely told us no and told us to sit down. All of us were astonished by how rude they were, and when we asked to speak to the manager, he simply told us that we could leave if we wanted to. We then all made the decision to leave, and he  simply told us,\"okay, leave\".  How could you be so prideful when talking to several paying customers!",

This place has been open a long time and been here before. Had my son and father in law so tried a few other things. Got the egg rolls and banh xeo. Veggies are excellent and fresh. Egg rolls are tasty and banh xeo was hefty but mostly filled with bean sprouts. Large chunks of pork and shrimp.   Bun bo hue is good and served with a large chunk of pork trotter. Pretty good flavor but not as rich and deep as Pho Thanh. My son had the pho tai. A little too anise-y for me. My son chowed down on it though.   Good option since Pho Thanh is closed for a while.

I give them a 5 just because I am a fan of the pho and the service and I've been coming here for a year or so.  I will say that in the past 3 months there has been 2 mistakes with my order.  The first time they fixed immediately, the second time I didn't even mention because it was pho and I really just wanted to eat it and it gave me a chance to try something new.  Anyway my point being is that if they make a mistake they will fix it and there food is very delicious!",

Over the past 2 years, I've been to Cyclo, Little Saigon and Saigon Nites, and all were good. Little Saigon was the best, but that's a review for a different page....   Da Vang has a great BBQ Pork Vermicelli. I ordered the noodle bowl with BBQ pork and ground shrimp (Bun Chao Tom Thit Nuong) and it was the best I've had in the Valley. One minor flaw: their fish sauce served with the Bun was not good. When you have a dish with such simple yet complex flavors, that can't happen in such a basic broth.   The spring rolls were average; I prefer more mint and cilantro, and without that brown meat (turkey? pork? mystery meat is bad in spring roll. Next time, I'll ask for vegetarian since I prefer tofu. My fault.) Also, their sauce was much worse than I am accustomed to. The hoisin was too sweet and overpowering.    They serve their Thai tea with a glass of ice and a 6 oz sealed bottle of Thai Tea. I don't know why I feel different about that, but I was disappointed it wasn't a concoction from the kitchen.  As others have said, this is not a place for atmosphere, however I did receive attentive and courteous service. I also have a full serving in a leftover box for dinner.  To summarize, It is a very delicious place to eat, and I will definitely go back, probably for some pho. The overall dining experience was probably 4th best in the city, but because I go for one specific dish, and they make the best I've had here, I bump up their star rating by 1 from 3 to 4.",

Honestly you can't beat this place for the prices (Appetizer, meal, and a drink for $10!), variety (huge menu!) and really good, authentic food.  Honestly I feel like many of the complaints about this place are...rather superficial. :/  1) \"Area is ghetto/no decoration\" - ...And your point is?  I don't come here to stare at the walls, I come here to EAT!  Seriously, who cares?!  2) \"Bad service\" - Honestly I think their service is great, but people need to understand one simple fact: much of the staff speaks very limited English.  Be realistic.  The servers that do speak English remember us, remember the things that we order, and let us make plenty of substitutions - my favorite part!  3)\"They bring out food at random times, sometimes meals before appetizers, some meals come way before others.\" - Yep.  I'm unsure, but this might just be a cultural thing, because we've been to other restaurants that do this as well.  Personally, I love it, I wish American restaurants did this.  I want my food when its fresh and hot, and that's when they deliver it, not sitting on a counter getting cold for 20 minutes while your friends' food cooks. No complaints here!  In conclusion: Da Vang rocks! :D  A few of our favorite dishes:  Salt and Pepper shrimp, pork organs stir fry, and the egg banh mi with ham and liver spread.",

    "text": "Da Vang is 5-star food at traditional, 1-star prices.  I've never spent more than $10 here, and that usually includes at least one appetizer or dessert.  The service is the best I've had at a Vietnamese place.  Sure, there might be a pretty thick language barrier, but it's never gotten in the way of finding the perfect dish or having the order come out exactly as expected.  Of course I'd recommend getting some Pho (stick with chicken unless you're either very adventurous or completely sure what the other ingredients are).  You can also keep it simple and delicious by getting a BBQ pork sandwich, like I almost always do (and if you really want to be like me, make sure to tell them no mayo).  But seriously, if you take one thing away from this review - TRY DESSERT.  I'm not a fan of the spongy-green cakey things, but the deserts in the cooler are usually very good.  I'd recommend any of the coconut-milk-based concoctions in the plastic cups.  Ask for a cup of crushed ice, pour the dessert on top, and enjoy.  Don't be freaked out - there will likely be some sort of beans, maybe seaweed, who knows what - but it will be delicious.  Did I mention the people here are awesome?  Great food, great service, and your wallet won't be sore the next day (neither will your stomach).",

    "text": "Being from CA (San Francisco to be specific), Pho is hard to get comfortable here since its just simply not as good as home.  BUT this place!  This place is as good as it gets!  Especially now that the Arizona weather has cooled down quite a bit and with the flu season at its peak, a bowl of hot pho is exactly what everyone needs.  Their prices are more than reasonable for what you get and the quality is unbeatable.  Came here first time with some girl friends (we're all from CA) and we totally loved the food.  It was cheap and good!  Second time with the boyfriend and he loved it too, we ordered the spring rolls, love their spring rolls!  The bowl of pho, especially the large one is very hard to finish since its so big but I usually get that one since the boyfriend always wants some pho with his broken rice dish!  The restaurant is decently big and roomy with plenty of seating and host/ waiters/ bus boys running around to either seat you, serve you or clean up after you.  Some people think they're rude but I dont mind the place, they are efficient is what I honestly think.  The food speaks for itself so if youre looking for a good pho place, definitely check them out.  They take cards and cash, good for kids, seniors, families, etc.  Small parking lot shared with other businesses AND the drive up way is small and comes up fast! Enjoy!",

I went to Da Vang after looking at reviews here as well as the rankings in the New Times, and it did not disappoint. A generous portion (for $5!) with rich, complex broth, tons of fresh herbs and bean sprouts to add flavor and crunch, and a wide selection of sauces to customize the flavor. In addition to pho it has a wide selection of Vietnamese classics, all at ridiculously low prices. The atmosphere is authentic for vietnam...meaning, pretty sparse and straightforward. That's kind of why I can't give five stars...well, that and because they don't have alcohol I couldn't get a Bia 333 or Huda to round out the meal. Still it is probably the best I've had in Phoenix, and except for the ice cold air conditioning (thank God) it is about as close to Saigon as you can get in town.",

    "text": "Da Vang (pronounced yah yang) is a hole in the wall in a sketchy ass strip mall next to the latin strip club and the Vietnamese Boba Tea shop. Weeknights and Weekends alike, this place is packed to the gills with Asian families, Mexicans from the neighborhood, and the few rogue gays and hipsters who wander in to try something ironic or obscure. Then you have the old Mexican ladies who walk by every table and put a car air freshener on it with a note explaining that you can buy it from her for $1. There are countless flies, the place hasn't been cleaned since Jesus was alive, and the parking lot almost requires four wheel drive. There isn't a more third-world dining experience in Phoenix.  My initial inpression was that this would be a fantastic trip to a Vietnamese wonderland. Seeing the types of people eating here, the extensiveness of the menu, and the overall ruggedness of it probably meant it was legit. I'm not Vietnamese, Asian, or any shade of yellow, but I like to think I still know my food well enough to say that it was an absolute let down. I ordered one of the most basic dishes, Pho Tai which is a beef broth with rice noodles and sliced beef. It's typically served with jalapeno rings, bean sprouts, basil, and lemon wedges on the side, yet mine was minus the jalapenos and lemon. Each table of Asian people who ordered the same thing both before and after me, received the said items with their meal. After my plate of half the veggies I need arrived, they brought by our spring rolls. Again, total disappointment. The sauce which accompanied them tasted like pure Hoisin, and I much prefer the typical peanut sauce or even a fish sauce. My girlfriend's bowl of Bun looked like the noodles were garbage, and was extremely short on veggies and meat.   Our server was nice enough, and rather typical of a restaurant of this type. They don't speak much, their way of asking if you'd like to order is saying \"are you done?\" After a while though, I realized he was a Spanish speaker, and then I realized he was of hispanic heritage, nice. I come to this Vietnamese place and there are Mexicans working both front and back of the restaurant. Made me want some enchiladas. Overall, this restaurant was a complete let down and if it hadn't been for the very low price (under $20 for two people) I'd have been very upset. I'll keep sticking with Little Saigon, Pho Thanh, Koai Hoan, and Dong A.",

Don't expect any great atmosphere and service, but do come hungry and ready to have some of the best roast pork sandwiches ever!

Our family used to come up from Tucson when I was in college, YEARS ago, to eat here. It might have been because it was one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix at the time and it resembled what was cooked at home.  That being said, we KNOW our Vietnamese food!! Tonight's experience completely fell short of our expectations. The broth to my seafood Pho was soooooo bland I really had to doctor it up with lots of fish sauce.  My brother's beef stew Pho was about the same...BLAND! My niece's special combo broken rice was so-so. The sweet and sour fish sauce that accompanies the rice dish was too sweet...not the correct balance of sweet, sour and salty.  My boyfriend's bbq pork fried rice was just ok as well.  The aroma was nice when it came out but he didn't touch the bbq pork pieces in the rice...they were dry and tasted like they were weeks' old pork that they didn't want to throw out so they decided to use it for fried rice. We also got shrimp spring rolls, one of my favorite dishes.  These rolls were also bland and didn't have any mint in them...SO disappointing!! We will definitely NOT be returning to this place and will go back to Pho 43rd Express, except on Mondays...their Pho is YUMMY!!!! I promise you that, this is coming from a full blood Asian born in Vietnam that knows her Vietnamese food!",

And after having sampled both on multiple occasions, I have decided that Da Vang is the winner.     Though both places serve great food at reasonable prices Da Vang's food is just a little better - and the main reason is their Thit Nung (grilled pork).  While Pho Thanh serves a grilled ground pork patty, Da Vang serves thin slices - which is far superior.  This one item shifts the entire battle in their favor.   I urge you to try a Banh Mi Thit Nung at both and see for yourself which one is better.    That said for atmosphere, I think Pho Thanh would be more inviting to the average person.  Totally recommended.",

The soup is really greasy and they even place a large slab of fat in the mix of beef, but that's probably why it tastes so good.  Really big portions for the price too. The Super size #1 is absolutely gigantic.   When I'm not in the mood for pho, I usually get their barbecue beef over rice which is also amazing.  Their desserts are interesting to try, and a nice way to get rid of that greasy beefy taste in your mouth. Cheap at $1.75 too.   This place has really cleaned up over the years getting nicer tables and a generally cleaner dining area. Not quite the hole in the wall when I first tried this place almost a decade ago.  Service has always been fairly fast and friendly. At one point I used to come here almost once a week with my family and the server remembered us and our orders every time.  The only bad thing i can think of is their sandwiches are fairly disappointing and it's a half hour drive to get here for me, but it's worth it every time.",

    "text": "Pho.  I've missed it since moving to Arizona.  Tragic, I know.  Recently I became fixated on it.  Had to have it.  For a week it was pretty much the only meal I could think about.  Where, oh where to get it in Phoenix?  Lucky for me, I know people.  People who know where to go to feed my need for Pho.  Da Vang!  Right when we walked into Da Vang, I knew it was going to be good.  It just looked, well, like it was supposed to.  A little worn, and more utilitarian than attractive - you know that everyone comes for the food, not the decor.  The menu is pretty extensive - almost overwhelming, and conveniently numbered for people like me who would butcher the pronunciation of the dishes.  I should have taken more time to review, but I was on a mission.  A Pho-king mission and I wasn't leaving without it.  To start, we enjoyed deliciously fresh spring rolls - one type with shrimp (#48) and the other with BBQ pork (#49).  Both were prepared with crisp refreshing mint leaves and went oh so well with the peanut dipping sauce.  Heaven!  The beautiful big bowl of seafood pho (#12) that was placed before me was well worth waiting for.  Oh!  Shrimp, crab, squid and more!  Bathed in a succulent broth and surrounded by a hearty portion of rice-stick (thin) noodles.  Love these!  Seeing my friend's noodle envy, I surrendered a portion to add to his Pho, which came with thicker noodles (and looked awesome, too).  I like the burn, so I heated up my broth with chili sauce, sriracha, lime juice and even a couple jalapeno slices.  After a few bites my lips were on fire - perfect!  My only regret is that there was no way that I could even consider dessert.  Physically impossible after all of the amazing food I had consumed.  I am sure they would have been good.  Well, I just have a reason to go back!  Well worth the drive.  Da Vang, I know where to find you now, and plan on seeing you often!",

I am leaving this review because my hubby liked his bowl of pho so much, he wanted me to leave a review for this establishment.  Centrally located, inexpensive and great food.  Not much more we can ask for after a long day at the aquatic center and children's museum.  2 stars for parking lot cleanliness and 5 stars for food.  We'd go back any day for the tasty pho.",

Old Vietnamese dudes hanging out and chilling, Vietnamese waiters wearing knockoff brand clothing; what more can you ask for at a PHO joint?  I always order the Pho Tai just to checkout the broth first minus the extra stuff.  Yep, it passes the taste test.  Don't forget your Vietnamese coffee - can't eat Pho without one.  I definitely recommend this place - if you're afraid to come don't worry it's AZ you can carry your weapon and conceal it!",

    "text": "I liked this place. I had a few hours left before catching my flight out of Phoenix and had a craving for good and cheap Vietnamese food. Thanks to TripAdvisor, we found Da Vang!  Service - quick to seat us, bring us drinks (water), refilled our water and I noticed they kept an eye out just incase we needed something else.   Food - Portions were reasonable, and I would say more on the plus side than skimpy and I thought everything we ordered was flavored well! Not bland, not loaded with MSG.  1) Had their spring rolls, which were made fresh (I love spring rolls and can tell when they've been sitting out). 2) I had their Banh Cuon (rice rolls with grilled pork, sliced pork and garnished with bean spouts, shallots, and some other stuff with a side of fish sauce) and I was super happy. A big plate came out with lots of meat. All for under $6 (I'm from the Bay Area, and I've been paying on average $8).  4) Also ordered 2 glasses of dessert, one bean and the other jelly (see my pictures). They came out in the larger glass cups filled with beans/jelly, which is much nicer than it being filled with lots of ice as I have experienced many times before.  5) On top of all that, we ordered 2 banh mi sandwiches to go for later to eat on the flight - even though I ate it hours later, it still tasted good and I didn't even have a chance to reheat it in an oven. Bread was still somewhat soft, so at least I know they didn't make it using old french bread.   Cost - Everything I listed above cost us $21. Seriously, 2 1. Since they were nice to us and really fast with everything, we gave them a 4 dollar tip, so total cost was $25.   I see some less than stellar reviews here and I wish they had the experience my husband and I had. They were really nice to us and they even talked to us a bit at the end of lunch, such as where we are from and why am I taking pictures of their food and menu :) Just wish there was one like them in San Francisco so I can visit more often.",

I love Pho Ga, but every other pho place around hear is to lazy to make the chicken broth, its always with beef broth and it just never tastes right. This place on the other hand had the best Pho Ga I've have ever since moving here. The seasoning was perfect and the chicken was cooked well. We came right after lunch hour, so the service was a few minutes slower than expected. Also, they probably went through then etire pot of regular pho broth, so my fiances pho was not as good (it had a lil oil at the top).  I was very impressed with the portion size and price. Its a few dollars cheaper than any other pho place around hear and they offer the XL bowl for $1.50 extra, a great value.",

You've read the reviews, and decided to go, and so it is; STILL, yes STILL, a hole in the wall.  Getting your water refilled sometimes requires you to get up and almost get it yourself. Tapping on the glass with a nearby chopstick works too, if you're feeling rude, as I have once or twice.   My 3 stand-bys are the 37B, Vermicelli with BBQ pork and I get the shrimp whole. Ground shrimp, no thanks. I love the lemon grass beef, and the pho. The Spring rolls are awesome, as well. Flu season would have REALLY REALLY sucked without the pho from Da Vang.    In conclusion, the service is very hit and miss. Get you own water, if necessary. The food is 4 star, in my opinion. And that makes up for the iffy service.",

Being westsider-riders, my family and I have been eating at this restaurant for as long as I can remember. My mom's old hair salon was only a mile away, so we often stopped by in the morning for banh mi or spring rolls take-out. If you're not familiar with banh mi, make sure you try to catch one of the episodes of No Reservations when Bourdain goes to Vietnam. A bite of the banh mi (sandwich) is like having a flavor explosion in my mouth. Sometimes I'm not a fan of the lightly pickled cucumber, but the jalapeno slices always gives me a nice jolt of spiciness, and the flavors of the meat are awesome! You can always ask them to remove any of those items from the sandwich.  The pho here is always good, and my brother and I also love the bun bo hue, which comes with vermicelli noodles and a dang good, spicy broth. The meats they toss in here aren't typically what you'd find on mom's dinner table, so make sure you read the menu and are cool with those.   The reviews regarding the decor are definitely accurate. Had I not been growing up on the stuff made here, I would probably think again about going back. They have actually even remodeled, and expanded it since I was a child! If you're that concerned about it, I suggest ordering take-out. I've never gotten sick from the food here, so I assume the kitchen is clean!   Another great plus is that the food is very affordable. I had dinner here on Sunday, and the total for two people in food comas was $11.25.",

    "text": "\"Hurts so good - come'on baby make it hurt so good...\" ------------------------  First of all, thanks to S.B. and Mr. K for joining me for day of beautiful weather and damn good Vietnamese food. It was everything I was hoping to achieve and for the full table of food - we each paid less than $12/each. Craziness.  I am going to have to let the men speak for themselves and ask that they share their meal with everyone, but I can tell you from my perspective - lunch was damn good and worth the three-hour-nap that I took afterwards.   I had saved my daily java for the Vietnamese hot stuff that I knew would be at the restaurant - and it had more sweetened condensed milk in it than I expected - but I 'suffered' through it. It was good.  We had Shrimp Spring Rolls and a Vietnamese Crepe Appetizer that had a plate of accompaniments such as mint, lettuce, and cucumber. We devoured both - and I'm pretty sure that it was because they were good, not just because of our hunger pangs - but again, I'll leave it to the men to discuss.  Then they started bringing the additions for my Pho - I ordered the 2A - Beef Pho. I had a plate full of bean sprouts, jalapenos, and purple Thai basil. When the Pho came I filled it with all the jalapenos, most of the basil, and a strong hand-full of bean sprouts and a good spray of Siracha sauce. Damn. It is so good.  I start with chopsticks and am working through very methodical bites of jalapeno, basil and pieces of meat. Oh crap. I don't know these guys and I ams starting to search in my food. What are they saying, crap...we're having a conversation...and it's a good one. Focus, I have to stay focused! Okay, I am out of beef - there's lots of broth and a ton of rice noodles left - I need to get busy - loose the chopsticks this is a job for a fork and spoon! I dig in Italian style.   I, then, initiate the fork/spoon twirl and soon find that the prep cook never split the noodles - this is a bowl of fully connected, never-ending rice noodles. Crap. I am going to have to try to bite in and not be too obvious - SSSSSLLLLLLLUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPPPPP! And, there it is. I slurped in front of strangers and not just once, it was more like five, ten or fifteen times. I knew I was getting full and wasn't making so much as a dent in my Pho - and I was starting to embarrass myself - so I held back. Not to mention, just as when you eat ice cream too fast, you get a cold brain; when I eat too much Pho too fast, I get \"fat, fuzzy, MSG head.\"  Mr. K., and S.B., thanks for joining me and I'm still singing.... \"Hurts so good, come'on baby make it hurt so good.\"",

I got the textural carnival in my mouth. Very good.   Ate the bean sprout, chicken, shrimp filled egg crepe... Not very good.  Erase chicken and shrimp from the description and would have been more accurate. I guess I also like charred crepes sometimes, don't we all.   But hey, I liked something, so that's okay. Plus good drink pure coconut juice with coconut bits to chew on.   If you want Thai iced tea, you will receive it in a bottle.   Sunday is not my favorite day.",

True story... I had already bookmarked the bitch on Yelp so I could find it. So I knew it was in a strip mall in central/west Phx. The day finally arrives & I'm salivating for some Pho. It was hot summer day in August in urban AZ but I'm a soup eating girl & this is my day tear me up some Pho. She arrives early & I'm a minute late. The menu is vast but she's got her order ready in her head & I trust my dear friend & also am not about to make her wait while I attempt to digest the huge menu. So I let her choose what we're eating. After she placed our order she also says I've been eating here since I was this big & shows a small amount of distance from the floor. She says the service is bad & always has been. It's just the way it is. BTW it wasn't the best service but with Pho this good as long as it was same day service I'm good. Man alive seriously this was the best Pho, spring rolls & iced Vietnamese coffee with sweeten condensed milk I've EVER had (side note: this is the first Vietnamese Coffee I've ever had but as a non coffee drinker this was good good). Can't wait to go back. Promised my hubs I'd take him soon. But... if I thought I could go back & not get caught by my hubs & hung from the highest tree I would. It's that Mmmm Mmm good. Thanks Jen you rocked my Pho world.",

I don't know if they use any other animal broth in it, because I am willfully ignorant of such matters.  Regardless, if you are a meat eater or a vegetarian, try the tamarind soup, and bring friends.  It is super yummy.  They also have a rice-based soup.  And, if you talk to your server, they can likely recommend some vegetarian/tofu based dishes that will be wonderful.  Everything else is as good as everyone says it is.  Wouldn't be surprised if people got an occasional bowl of sub-par pho; every family restaurant makes mistakes.  I'd recommend everyone try it again.",

But the soup is just great. People, don't come if you don't like good tastes. Or cheap prices.  But yes, if you are looking for a nice restaurant, this is not a nice place to visit.

    "text": "This is one of my all time favorite dives in Cenpho (So stay away if you are foodie who needs a higher level of ambiance). For me, it's the best Vietnamese in town! And you've gotta LOVE the prices... sometimes I eat there for a mere $4! And I just discovered their won ton soup selections! Having recently recovered from being sick... and also craving soups during the winter season... I'm so very excited about this new discovery!  This is comfort food for me... a restaurant I actually usually order the same things at, instead of trying new things, but favorite dishes are favorite dishes: Here they are:  Both their Goi Coun (Fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork) and Cha Gio (Fried egg rolls) are great! I just told a friend that if I were to choose an eggroll as my favorite it would be the Vietnamese eggroll: Cha gio... alone it's great, but wrapped in lettuce leaf and dipped in nouc cham... sooo good, and makes ya feel a little healthier. I'd have to say that having gone to many a Vietnamese restaurant around town, they don't skimp on their rolls. You get 2 for a little more than $2. I've seen other restaurants state a quantity of four, but they slice 2 in half and charge $4.95+! Ridiculous!   So that $4 meal I was talking about? 2 orders (4 rolls) of Goi Coun... it's so refreshing and pretty healthy if you aren't obsessed with NOT eating carbs and looking for something cool and refreshing (Great for summertime eats).  Another dish I love is their BBQ Pork and Broken Rice Dish. Alone, this dish is a meal for me x 2-3 and it's only $5... divide and discover how cost effective this dish is. The first time I had it, I fell in love with the texture of broken rice so much that I had to go off to an Asian grocery store to grab a bag... and I don't know what they use to marinate the meat, but it is so tasty and then you get to dip it in Nouc Cham for more flavor complexity!  And now, I must talk about Pho. Again, their Pho is my favorite in town... #2... I don't mess around and just order the thin slices of beef with the broth noodles and soup with the generous servings of veggies on the side. Very simplistic, but you can go full out and have it with Tripe and other daring additions. I guess I'm a traditionalist when it comes to this soup.  Another soup I love is their #17 Large Noodle Soup (sans pork hock)... the first time I saw these noodles, I was eating with a Vietnamese friend, who knew what to order. The shape of the noodles are quite interesting and of course tasty!  If you're feeling less brothy and are in the mood for a medley of tastes and textures, I suggest ordering from the Rice Stick Noodle portion of the menu. It's basically thin white noodles with veggies and an assortment of your choice of meat combo with a side of Nouc Cham sauce that you pour atop and mix into the noodles. I actually don't prefer the noodles and ask for rice instead (Complete with perplexed looks from the waiter). What I love most about the dish is that you can have BBQ Pork and Shrimp and chopped up pieces of Cha Gio in one dish for $5... it's like having your appetizer and main course in one dish for the price of one dish! What a STEAL!  As for service... it's a bit interesting and sometimes seems standoffish (but that's how most Vietnamese restaurants are, I've come to find), but I've been going to Da Vang for so long I'm used to it and they've even come to know me (and my phone in orders). When you're done, just go up to the cashier and pay.   And I'll leave you with one last tip: The family that owns the restaurant has just opened up Boba Juice, a Boba aka Tapioca Tea/Smoothie shop in the same strip mall. I sometimes go there before to grab a drink to go with my meal or after for dessert on the go. I love that they are willing to try whatever flavor concoction your brain can come up with! Yes, it's from powder, but hey, it's a place you can grab Boba in Phoenix that's not in Metro Phoenix (aka Mesa, Tempe, Chandler or Gilbert!)",

    "text": "My family and I first dined at Da Vang when it occupied a single store front in that complex, basically where the cashier is located. Imagine the side walls up for the left half of the restaurant. It was a tiny place, that was back in '94. It's 2010, and Da Vang has grown to quite a large restaurant, and the owner's son has now taken over the family restaurant. The son used to own Phoung Huang in the former Lee Lee complex at Dobson and Southern where Asiana Market and Hodori Restaurant have taken up its space.  Da Vang is a no frills kinda Vietnamese place, yes it's dirty but I've never gotten sick and I have a very weak stomach. We usually order #18 and #19, #22, #39 or #40, #42, #43, and #44, and #50 for the egg rolls. Their wide rice noodle stirfry with seafood and egg closely resembles a Malaysian favorite of mine that's usually sold by street hawkers and that's Kway Teow. YUM! Their egg noodle soups are good and quite large, and their prices are not pricey. The restaurant itself is not in a great area, since it borders Maryvale... so it's kinda sketchy. The food makes up for the restaurant's appearance and atmosphere. It's just wholesome Vietnamese home cooking, nothing special nor fancy, a place to go for a quick bite of pho, or noodle soup, and finish it off with either Vietnamese coffee or a glass of Soy Bean Milk. Simple fare and very good too!",

I usually start off with an order of Bei Cuon and get a \"fresh fruit drink\" (sorry, the gringo in me does not know what the actual name of the ch is).  I'm not a huge fan of their Bun Thit Nuong (sorry if I can't spell this, remember I'm a gringo) because the barbecue pork seems greasy to me.  Every once in a while I order their red pork sandwich (hands down the best baguette bread on the planet!).  Pour a bit of the nouc mam (fish sauce) with the chilies on the bread--mmmmm I'm salivating.  (Can not wait to go to lunch here tomorrow!!!)  But the real reason we go is the pho.  Everytime we go, there are a TON of Vietnamese there.  Yeah, the place could probably be cleaner, and I have no idea what they are going to do when they enforce the no smoking ban... but man, I sure forget about it when I am face down in my pho bowl.",

First off, you know this place is good and authentic because every time you go in there are plenty of Vietnamese people enjoying their wonderful traditional Vietnamese offerings.  If you never have had Vietnamese food before, it is exceptionally flavorful, french inspired, light, clean Asian cuisine that couldn't stand out more from Chinese food and Thai food throughout the valley.  Vietnamese food is truly a refined cuisine and this place hits every mark.  I have lived in the bay area for many years, a place which has excellent Vietnamese food and many Vietnamese people, and let me tell you this place does not disappoint.  Very clean, fresh, well prepared, delightful food.  Awesome pho, great noodle dishes, rice dishes, and amazing spring rolls.  The BBQ pork is a must try an in my opinion the flavor rivals traditional American style BBQ in deliciousness.  I have not tried the Vietnamese style sandwiches yet, but I assume they are great.  This place is AMAZINGLY LOW PRICED as well!  Like I'm talking $5.50 for a huge plate with shrimp, assorted seafood, and pork chicken or beef, low priced.  Really the value here is unbeatable.  Be sure to order a Thai iced tea to complete the experience.  We are very lucky to have this place here in Phoenix.",

I still love it & would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Love this place - it's a bit far from my house, but when I want a good rice or pho dish with out-of-this-world soy milk, I make the trek.  Don't be too afraid by the looks of this restaurant sitting in a raggedy strip mall.  The inside doesn't get much better either.  The place is mostly run by men - and on occasion I see a female at the register.  But these guys know their stuff and are quick.    I always order their com thit nuong trung chien - translates to their bbq pork with rice and a fried egg on top. It also comes with a side of nuoc mam (fish sauce) that I love to pour over my rice and leave a little in the bowl to dip my meat in.  I love the sauce that much.    I also order as an appetizer, their goi cuon - spring rolls.  Their rice paper is so darn chewy and perfect.  I don't know where they buy it from, but I have to find them!  But if you're ever there, please order the soy milk. It's made in-house and is sweet and delicious. I always order it in a large to-go cup as it's bigger than their regular glasses.",

When we arrived it was 7:20pm and we where rushed to order and then when we decided what we wanted we where told that they don't have it because it takes too long to make. Its was crazy to think that 40 minuets was not enough time to make rice with beef.  I ended up ordering the Pho and iced coffee and my husband decided not to eat. My daughter shared my food and although the customer service was horrible the food was good.  Also, my daughter (2 years old) broke a pepper shaker and the waiter proceeded to scold her as she tried to grab the salt shaker, I'm sorry but please don't talk to my daughter. Leave that for us- her parents!",

This place is comparable, if not better, than all those places both in quality and price.   We came here for lunch on a weekday and it was filled with people. The service was prompt, efficient, and professional. There were a couple times when the waiter forgot our request and we would have to gently remind him.   I ordered vermicelli noodles with BBQ pork and an eggroll (~$6) and my mom ordered combination no. 1 pho  (~$6). The portions were satisfactory. The food was fresh and hot. The pho broth was flavorful. The BBQ pork was thick and juicy. The price is unbeatable with no compromise to the quality of the food.  I will definitely frequent this place anytime I'm in the area. This is the best vietnamese restaurant I've been to in Phoenix.",

The bbq pork and fish cake bun was served with lots of meat in a huge bowl and we had more herbs/lettuce/limes, etc. than we ever could want or need. The shrimp stuffed tofu was ample.

It follows all of the rules of finding great ethic food in a big city (e.g. family-owned, always packed, and lots of folks from the country of origin), and the price point is impossible to argue with. It's probably the cheapest delicious meal you can get in the city.  Of course, you'll want to try the Beef Pho, but there's so much more to explore on this menu if you wander around a bit. I don't love the Bahn Mi here (too much bread), but they're wonderfully cheap if you're looking to fill your belly on the fly. I also love the chicken porridge when I'm not in the mood for Pho.  Some folks might be turned off by the location, which is definitely modest, but we're here to eat good Vietnamese food, not luxuriate in leather armchairs. I go here regularly, and not out of habit. I wouldn't recommend it if you only have time to try a few places on a vacation, but if you live in Phoenix, it would be a mistake to not make a habit out of Da Vang.",

The only caveat I have for the place is that sometimes they don't have a lot of the foodsin the menu- like their curry. Also the place could really benefit on a make over- been to places like little miss Saigon that has the atmosphere and decorations on top of their delicious food. But other than that its all good.  If its your first time- get the BBQ bun. Its very delicious and very cheap then grab a pho - number 1.",

Sure, the service is a little sub-par. I've been forgotten on numerous occasions, and my order has been wrong once or twice or twenty times. But that's not why you go to Da Vang. You go because the flavor to value ratio is ridiculously in your favor. Pho for under $6. Bun for under $7. And vietnamese coffee done the right way with plenty of condensed milk for under $3.   If you don't like dives, don't go to this place. But if you love great food at a great value, then look no further. This is the place- mafia family included.",

Good thing I've eaten pho before, so I know how long it should take.  I get to the restaurant. Eh, a little dingy, but when I'm eating a bowl of good pho, the universe could implode, and I wouldn't notice. I personally didn't have any problems waiting to pay for my order (maybe five to ten minutes) but apparently from the other reviews there's sometimes a backup. I pay, but they have me wait a little longer because they thought I had ordered a small instead of a large. Only takes a few seconds, so I guess all they do is add more? Apparently so, because I had an OUTRAGEOUS amount of noodles. I mean, the whole container was almost exploding full of noodles. It didn't look like they gave me any more chicken, but the chicken was the real deal - good mix of white and dark meat.  Now. The Soup for me is 95% of how I view a restaurant's pho. Theirs... sucks. It was bland, smelled strange, and just didn't do it for me. This is the second \"popular\" pho place I've tried that has had a weird, onion-y, dregs from the deep fryer vat smell to it. I don't know if this another regional version or something, but this ain't the pho I'm used to. I've eaten pho with Vietnamese friends, so I trust that it's been original. Where is the flavor, man? I had to dump four spoonfuls of gochujang (Korean chili pepper paste) into my soup to give it any sort of flavor, and I usually prefer to eat pho bare bones. Don't even normally stir in hoisin and sriracha.  C'mon, Arizona. Is this some sort of weird initiation process I have to go through before I find a place that serves decent pho? (Now that's not totally fair; there's a place in that corner plaza on Dobson and Southern that has pretty decent pho.)",

If you have been here and feel like service was not 'up to par,' 'accommodating.' or 'it's dirty,' you obviously do not know what a real Asian restaurant is like. Believe me, most Asians dgaf when it comes to this but in my opinion, the more they dgaf, the better the food is.   My family have been all around this state trying out Vietnamese restaurants and we have been coming back here despite the distance since I was little. Portions are big and prices are still cheap to this day, what more can you ask for?  No one does egg rolls better than them and no one, in my opinion can do a better pork and rice dish than them. If you're a novice, just simply order a #1: a big fat bowl of pho and nomlicious meat. Squeeze some lime in your broth, add some bean sprouts, and squeeze sriracha sauce and you have a meal fit for a really really obese 17th century king/queen. If you're not so much a noodle fan like I am, order a #41. I bet you have never eaten such succulent fatty pork in your life before. Douse the rice with the fish sauce and eat it all together with the lettuce they give you and you'll know what's going on. Or at least your stomach will.  Top it off with some Vietnamese iced coffee and I'm sure you'll be coming back to this somewhat shady but absolute gem.",

All of the good Pho in Phoenix seems to be nestled around 19th Ave between Osborn and Camelback which is not my favorite part of town. Don't let the sketchy area put you off, it's worth venturing into the hood. The prices are  incredible. We got two orders of spring rolls, two bowls of pho, and two desserts (SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT OH. MY. GAH.) our bill came out to $23.  The service was \"meh\" at best, but this is not the kind of restaurant you go to for ambiance, or service, you patronage this establishment because you want authentic cuisine.

We've tried what seems like every Pho spot from CA to AZ and Da Vang is definitely on our top 3 places to eat.  Food is always hot, flavorful and plentiful.  Service is great, generally busy but quickly accommodating and did i mention we can feed a family of 6 for under $40. This includes an xtra lg bowl of Pho for the hubby, 5 reg bowls, and 3 orders of spring rolls. The pressed iced coffee is amazing and great service on the water refills. I also recommend the vermicelli bowl with seared tofu on an extra hot day in Phx. Great food any time of the day, any day of the year, including 115 weather. Dont let the location fool you because this place is not your typical commercialized Vietnamese restaurant. Simple ambiance make you almost feel like like a guest at your friends grandmothers.

    "text": "I would never have assumed that I'd have so many options for pho in Phoenix. Looking on Yelp, quite a few Vietnamese restaurants were received very well. I settled on Da Vang, which turned out to be exactly the kind of place I picture when I think of a pho restaurant. Well, the outside was a little more plain than necessary.  But you can't read a book by its cover, you know. Da Vang was actually having a lunch rush, with people coming in and out all the while. The decor is nothing fancy. The chair I was sitting on was pretty worn out, and the brown walls could use repainting. It's definitely a place with history.  Da Vang has a big menu with all the standard fare, plus some family meals (Chinese dishes), banh mi (for only $2.50!) and even lau (Vietnamese hot pot). Pho was really cheap here, ranging from $4.75-5.50 for regular sizes and an extra $1.50 for large. I had my usual pho tai nam, at $5.25, and it came out in five minutes.  For the first time ever, the pho arrived before my garnishes, though they were delivered soon after. The first taste of the broth was pleasing. It was light and clear, with a skilled use of spices. I thought it had the perfect degree of saltiness, and it was a little tangy even without lime. As for the meat, the rare steak was almost fully cooked, unsurprising because it was placed under the flank steak. Personally, I would have put it on top, but what do I know? The slices of flank were the fattiest ones I've ever eaten, too. Regardless, both types of meat were tender and had good flavor. The noodles were cooked to perfection, too.  Rating Breakdown:  Taste (11/14): Broth flavor- 4/5 Noodle & meat quality- 4/5 Garnish selection- 1/2 Portion size- 2/2  Restaurant (12/16): Service- 3/5 Cleanliness- 4/5 Atmosphere- 3/4 Speed of arrival- 2/2  Total: 23/30  Read more about my phoventures at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phoacrossamerica.com&s=ea8ceeadbd850acfe4078be485fb3f1e0155267c814903090bc26fc465e232e3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phoacrossamerica.com</a>",

It was not the Vietnamese bun bo hue but another dish that kind of resembled it. I felt as if I was eating pho with a hint of some other spices found in a typical bun bo hue dish.   The house fish sauce tasted like it came straight from the fish sauce bottle. I was actually pretty impressed with the peanut sauce though.

I typically go to Pho Thanh (which is much better by the way), but they were closed today for some reason. So I decided to give Da Vang another shot.  When I was seated, the table next to me asked if they could be served and the server said he'd be right back. The table got frustrated and left, which was a red flag I should have taken into consideration. It took 15 minutes after being seated to even be acknowledged by a server. Then after we ordered, we got our pho before we got our spring rolls. We brought this to the server's attention and he brought it out right away, so he basically forgot.   But now onto the actual food quality. The pho was mediocre at best. There was little flavor and tasted pretty bland overall. I ordered the large while my friend got the regular. The bowl sizes were different, but I'm almost positive that they just put the same amount of food in both sizes. The large just had more broth.  The spring rolls were mediocre as well. Didn't taste fresh like they should have. Their \"peanut sauce\" wasn't even peanut sauce, it was hoisin sauce with crushed peanuts on top.   Overall, this place has fallen off. I hope Pho Thanh is only closed temporarily because I won't be coming back to this spot.",

Will Go back for the Bahn Mi & possibly try a broken rice dish.",

    "text": "We ordered the following for breakfast: Ban Xeo (Pan-fried flour crepe with shrimp, pork, and bamboo shoots) Banh Mi Trung Rang (French bread sandwich with fried egg omelette) Chao Thap Cam (Rice porridge with shrimp, pork, squid, fish ball, and imitation crab)  The Good News: This is one of my favorite places to eat, I have become a regular here, and it is the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to thus far in southern Arizona. All of the entrees are always freshly and properly prepared. The service is quick and about as friendly as it gets for a Vietnamese restaurant and the prices cannot be beat. The crepe was cooked perfectly as was the meat and veggies inside, all of which were very tasty, and the serving size was plenty for two people. The French bread was fresh, light, and flavorful, the egg was cooked just right for a sandwich like this, and the veggie toppings(carrots, onions, cucumber, and jalapenos) were a perfect accompaniment. My dining companion had originally decided against having a sandwich, but once she saw how much I was enjoying it she joined in and ate the other half. The consistency of the rice porridge was just right (not too heavy or watery), there was ample portions of pork and all of the different seafood, and the serving size was plenty for two people.  The Rest of the Story: The place is a bit run down outside and there always seems to be the usual suspects hanging out in front, but don't let that deter you.  The Verdict: I make sure to eat here at least once or twice a month and will continue to happily do so.",

The pho here is the best in the valley. I've been to 10 other places and none of them even come close. Not on flavor and certainly not on price. I've switched from the 48 to the 48b (I like the BBQ pork more) and I've gone to ordering a Bahn Mi every visit.   Most other pho places, for 2 orders of pho and a couple appetizers, will run $30 for 2 people with tip. I'm consistently leaving Da Vang for $20 including a generous tip.  They are friendly, they refill your drinks continuously. They remember their regulars and our orders. What is not to like? The neighborhood? Get out of your hole!   ...Just don't use the east entrance... that incline is a killer! Use the entrance off the side street to the north. Your car will thank you.",

    "text": "Da Vang gets a GOLD STAR in the Pho department.  I stress this more because that is their staple.  Aside that, they are generally consistent in delivering a satisfying meal.  Gosh, it's really hard to sway my Pho-mentality whenever I stop by! I always glance at other items but when you do a price compare and the amount of ingredients, it just cannot be beat! Some might complain its a tad oily, but sometimes you just have to suck it up! They give you a generous-fill-you-up amount of noodles and meat! (Under $6)  However, I have managed to try other things such as Bun Bo Hue and Banh Mi.  The Banh Mi is pretty basic--baguette is usually toasty with fresh veggies, meats and smothered with liver pate spread ($2.50).  One will not fill you up, so add an appetizer.  Bun Bo Hue is not as great when compared to other places.  The beef stew is missing the braisey, stewey-ness.  Not terrible, just too simple in flavors for what I would expect.  And of course, how can you not order spring rolls ($2.25) when you sit down at a Vietnamese restaurant?  I would say the ingredients used is fresh enough (i.e. Shrimp, Pork Slices, Veggies). I always say, a fresh spring roll is a happy spring roll.  Just before I checkout, I almost every time grab one of my favorite desserts--sweet, cold coconut rice with beans that comes in a small cup.  Unlike other places, they make their desserts in-house.  Because I like this dessert cold, I multitask on the road hoping to not cause some kind accident on my way back to work.  I am just grateful that places like Da Vang still exist! Been a loyal customer since 1889. I kid, I kid (of course), I'm not that old!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Jj8ubiwwuCR-rrhrrjcryw?select=K2yzE052dFn0Sf0qoKK1ww\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Jj8u...</a>",

    "text": "Yo, I'm gonna' be pho-real here and say Da Vang (Yellow Skin/Vietnamese/Asian) is indeed run by Vietnamese people, it's a family run kinda business so expect that. However, I ain't hating on my own people but there is better Pho out there.  I typically go to 43rd for Pho since they come the closest in flavor and quality to that of the Bay Area and of course reminds me of Vietnam. The restaurant is pretty big, blasts Vietnamese music and even sells prepackaged goods up front, seems that a lot of it's customers are also for take out.  I ordered the Pho Tai, which is rice noodles, broth, sliced round eye steak and onions. The basil, bean sprouts, lime and jalapenos looked fresh when it was brought out separately. I love putting the basil in my Pho. I also wanted to order Soy Milk but they were out, as well as the Coconut Juice so I settled with a Thai Tea. Talk about drink rejection.  The Pho Tai was light in color instead of on the browner side, more similar to Chicken Broth, you could see the fat on the surface and it was slightly cloudy. The flavor was very simple, you could taste the spices but there wasn't a lot of depth or complexity to it. I also suspect a bit of MSG additive. My tongue was a bit numb/tingly and my thirst after my meal was unquenchable. (MSG sensitivity). The noodle bowls are premade- this I could tell because the noodles were stuck to each other and on the bottom of the bowl I had to stir the noodles around in the broth prior to eating. You do get a large amount of noodles however. The steak pieces were okay and it also came with brisket which I wasn't that fond of because of the fatty pieces.  Don't expect much service because you will only order and get served your food, that's it. Then again, I don't know many Vietnamese spots that continuously check up on you during your meal. Take it (eat it) and go! That's usually how it works.  For a bowl of pho and a drink, it came out to around $8 which isn't bad- but it isn't the best tbh. Great for your wallet, Pho craving or to fill your belly.",

The pho tasted home cooked with some fat just like the one we made at home during Christmas.  The meat was done perfect and tender tasty.  The noodles were cooked good.  The ingredients were great.  The broken rice dish special came with 2 kinds of fish cake, egg cake and grilled pork.  Because the food took a while, I did not send it back, when there was a piece of hair on the egg cake (refer to my picture of it and zoom in on the top).  The dish was done perfectly.  The fish sauce was good.  Of course, I didn't eat the extra ingredient, I picked the area with hair and placed it on the table.  After we left the restaurant, we noticed it did not have shredded pork and pork skins.  But the dish was executed perfectly in all the meats, vegetables and rice.  The service was pretty good.  The conversations the staff had were in Cantonese and Vietnamese, so I am guessing the owners are Chinese from Vietnam.  A place to come back to.  The prices were cheap and decent.  I almost forgot, for this place, the food is good, but yes, you have to deal with their creepy restrooms.  I felt their restroom was similar to one that you would find in a hospital basement.",

I know I shouldn't expect top notch dining service at a pho restaurant  But where I was seated the busboy cart full or dirty dishes was 2 cm right behind  me.  What was unpleasant was having my seat near the kitchen door with people goin in and out. What was stomach lurching was when I switched seats I had a view of their kitchen which looked grimy. The man at the front counter was wearing sandals when making drinks. A waiter who was taking out the trash I'm not sure if he washed his hands when he was later handling food.   Our noodle bowl itself was small, but decent. We enjoyed the grilled pork as they were marinated properly. But towards the end the noodles became mushy because of temperature and there wasn't enough  lettuce. The pickled veggies were sad strings.  We left full but unsatisfied.  .. The pro are the prices but you get what you pay for. This place needs some work.  Dining experience: 2 Food 3 Overall 2.5",

We started with the 48B BBQ pork spring rolls and a 75 BBQ pork banh mi sandwich, both which were amazing.  I have another place I go to for banh Mi's and this blew it out of the water. For our entrees my husband ordered the 66D Spicy stir fried beef which was served with sauteed onions over a bed of rice. The dish reminded me of something that you might find in a Chinese restaurant but we both really liked the flavors. I ordered the 38 which is vermicelli with shredded pork, coconut cream, lettuce, and crushed peanut. I was expecting more of a coconut curry style dish but this dish was served with thinly sliced meat and lettuce over wider noodles with a cold thick cream coconut sauce on top. I did not care for this dish, just very strange textures and tastes but my husband ate it for me and I ate his dish. The portions were good size and I think the prices were very reasonable. I look forward to going back and trying the Pho and other menu items on a future visit.",

The service was great and thanks to his helpful Vietnamese ordering skills we were able to try a variety of things that i normally wouldn't consider but found out that i love. Pho was delicious and very reasonably priced. Fried egg rolls were so good as well as an appetizer with rice paper and sugar cane shrimp which i can't remember the name of but I'll never forget those flavors. Have to order the iced coffee for a sweet pick me up after the meal. This isn't your trendy hipster Vietnamese spot, this is a timeless, authentic, Vietnamese cultural experience. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I'm going to give this 4 stars now. Let's do the breakdown:   Service: 5 stars. My second time in here was today at about 10am. I walked in and within 15 seconds I was greeted and given a table and menu. I did not feel rushed at all while looking at it, and as soon as I decided I was asked my order. All throughout the meal they were kind and they spoke good English. When I went up to the counter to pay, the cashier was extremely kind and made conversation. They are also open at 8am because people come in for coffee. So if you want Vietnamese for breakfast then go for it!  The Food: 4 stars. The pho I had last time I was not a big fan of at all...tho now I think that might have been because I added in the sauce they gave thinking it was supposed to be added, but without the sauce it would have been better....hey it was my first time ever eating it! Today tho I decided to try the #46, which was steamed rice with plenty of stir fried veggies, seafood of all kinds, and some chicken and meatballs with gravy.  The serving size was one gigantic plate full... I ate until I could eat no more and got a take out box... that was full. In all reality, this would be three decent sized meals. I really enjoyed this meal.... the rice was good texture as well as all the seafood (sometimes seafood, especially squid can be really rubbery) and the gravy just made everything perfect.   The Drink: 5 stars. So yeah.... um they have Vietnamese coffee.... the thing that has me going to every Vietnamese place I can find. I liked it better here than from Pho Thanh. But it still wasn't as good as from Mi Maxim. They did explain to me tho that the bottle of ht water they brought out of water was to pour into the little glass of coffee if it was too strong. I filled the glass up some more with the hot water (mainly just because hot coffee and more of it) and when it was about halfway gone I filled it back up . The coffee is strong and a little sweet.   The Price: 5 stars. #46 was only $5.75 (one of the more expensive meals on the list... most of the Pho is under $5, and the sandwiches are only $3. All deserts are $2. My coffee was $2 (cheapest out of the three places I've been) So it is very very affordable. Especially if you take in account the serving sizes.... You can get a rice dish (most are $5) 2 coffees, 2 orders of spring rolls, and feed two for under $15. That's hard to do at McDonalds!  Overall I will likely be back to this place since it is so cheap and very conveniently located like a quarter mile off of the light rail.",

    "text": "Da Vang is a little whole in the wall located in a strip mall in an \"interesting\" part of town. My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner at about 4pm on a Saturday. The place was packed! We were seated quickly and our order was taken 2 minutes after that. I already knew what I wanted, so that part was easy. We ordered the spring rolls, I had a medium sized chicken pho and husband had the extra large sized beef/brisket pho with egg noodle.   I'd have to rate the food 6 out of 10. The spring rolls were really good, but they were missing the little crunchies. My pho was hot and steamy, but it didn't have enough chicken. My husbands pho was delivered with vermicelli noodles and not egg noodles like he had ordered. We brought it to the servers attention and he happily corrected it. It's no fun sending food back. Ever see the movie \"Waiting\"? Yeah. That's why. Anyway...  Total cost for an order of spring rolls, 1 medium Pho, 1 extra large Pho and 2 Pepsi's came out to $19.47.   I will say I noticed the floors were really dirty. When I say really dirty, I mean food, plastic utensils and napkins on the floor dirty. So dirty that I slid on my way to wash my hands in the bathroom. That kind of grossed me out. A little sweeping in between patrons might be a good idea.",

The broth was a little sweet for my taste and for a combination, it seemed to be heavy on the tendon and light on the brisket. Like..no..brisket.   Aside from that, service was quick and friendly. Food was good, I would go there again and probably try a Com Tam dish. I saw one come out of the kitchen and the look reminded me of my time in Vietnam. Check it out.",

We have planned a trip for a nice family dinner to Da Vang for serval months, and finallly was able to go there yesterday.   We casually know the family who own this restaurant, but some of their workers leave much to be desired --- particularly the older, short, skinny man who takes the orders. He never ever seems to listen to the specifics of our orders. He does not repeat back to us what we ordered, especially when asked he heard what we just said. SMH.   We ordered several items and one of which was 2 extra large bowls of wonton soups. The wonton fillings were hard and the taste was sour, as though spoiled. The broth was off from what we are used to with their cooking.   We ordered the spring rolls with grilled pork and chicken. The grilled pork was extra dry and tasteless.   This is so unusual for them, or maybe not.   We have come to the conclusion that as their reputation expands and more people are coming in, they are too laxed and banking too much on their popularity, and NOT ENOUGH on the quality of the food and services.   We will not come back. There are just too many options now for good Vietnamese food in the Phoenix metroplex, to waste our money and precious time/energy on subpar food and low-level service.",

The only time I find this place quiet is first thing in the morning when they open; stopped in one day for iced coffee after dropping off the boys to school. Anyways, I am a creature of habit and typically get the Pho (beef ball or beef stew) but sometimes I get #36, the cold noodle with fresh veg, grilled pork and egg roll, and of course an iced coffee. I really enjoy the cold noodle and veg with the hot meat and egg roll. I see many other things that look good, but it's hard to resist the Pho.",

My group ordered pho and we had to ask for spoons 3 different times and anytime I asked for something, they ignored me, looked irritated and walked away. I understand if they are busy but don't treat people that way. I lost my patience with the 4 different people that came to our table. None of them were on the same page. We ordered the extra big bowl of pho and it barely had any meat in it. They might as well call it extra big bowl of noodles. I will never come back here again! It was ridiculous.",

Without question, a Vietnamese restaurant's legitimacy is measured by the quality of the ubiquitous pho broth.  Da Vang's has all of the earthy, aromatic, citrusy, salty richness that a pho connoisseur seeks when sitting down to a steamy bowl.  Add the bean sprouts and torn herbs, a squeeze of lime, and some peppers for hotness, and you are reveling in savory satisfaction.     Truth be told I've been here a dozen times, and despite the allure of the rest of the menu, I have ordered the large bowl of pho every single time.",

When it comes to vietnamese food, I love Bun Bo Hue so when I saw it on the menu. I had to try it.  I ordered it. The dish came out. It looks like how I expected except I didn't expect bean sprouts, lemons, basil, etc to come on the side but no big deal. The noodles in the dish was good, it was not under or overcooked. The broth was flavorful, not lots of msg. Some places use so much it's so salty. It was slightly spicy, just the way I like it! I would have like it more if it had more noodles but for about $5, it's not a bad deal. The pork's blood is okay, it's not the best or the worse. It had other meats in there as well like pig's feet. The meat was good. Overall, I would definitely come back to this place to get the Bun Bo Hue. (I don't know any other places in phoenix that would serve this and it's definitely decent)  Service is like any asian place. They just come to get your order and give you your food. You need to grab their attention to get the check or get anything else from them.  This place is very cold inside which was a good thing since it was so hot that day. It's nice and cool. They definitely crank up their AC.   I think the prices are the menu are very affordable and it's worth it.   Be aware that the neighborhood isn't the best either. You just need to be street smarts, driving through it I was like ehhh. Da Vang can also be hard to spot if you don't know what you're looking for. It just blended in through that complex.",

I understand that Chinese is apparently more \"traditional\" in this sense than Vietnamese, but I can think places far inferior than Da Vang to go to for this purpose.  Da Vang has a LOT more than just Pho (although they have just about every type and permutation of Pho possible), and the menu is chock full of all different kinds of Vietnamese cuisine.  I opted for a Vietnamese fried rice with pork sausage and chicken (which was quite good), and a type of Pho with beef brisket.  I really should have chosen the sliced beef over the brisket as I found the brisket pieces too tough to eat, although the Pho itself had a wonderful taste.  Service was good, prices are super low for the quantity of food, and my wife and I enjoyed our meals.  We'll be back, and we won't wait for Christmas 2012 next time. . .",

My typical order is #1 with meatballs, spring rolls, and a thai tea.  That comes out to about $10.",

    "text": "This place seems to be pitted against Pho Thanh quite often. I'll have to give it to Da Vang, but it's a NARROW, like a hipster's trouser leg narrow, win. One of the best Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had, and I'm from California, the place Asian food snobs usually say has the best of the best of anything Asian. The bread, baked on site, was airy and soft. Too often a Vietnamese sandwich shreds up the roof of my mouth, but not this one. I opted for the bbq pork, because I eat way too much chicken at home, and it was juicy and well flavored. I will say the pho broth is a little better at Pho Thanh, but DV's is no slouch.  Portions were not a problem. And really, just look at their menu prices! I'm not quite sure how many pounds of food per dollar people expect. You'll spend about the same here as you would at McDonald's for a much more enjoyable meal.  Sure the outside looks a little rough, but the interior isn't bad at all. Someone did complain the ac was too cold, but how else are you supposed to eat pho in the middle of a desert summer?",

An appitizer, pho for each person, drinks, and also dessert! That's a lot of food for a fantastic price. Will always go here until I basically die.",

As we walked in we stood around for a while trying to figure out if we should sit or wait to be seated,  Later I realized that the regulars just walk in hold their hand up with the # of people and get seated.  We went with the traditional beef pho which was very bland.  The kiddo thought the broth had a seafood flavor and I may agree.  We are pho snobs and this was a disappointment.  Hubby had the crunchy noodles with chicken that turn soft with the sauce it comes with.  That was pretty good.  The other kid and I had the pepper beef which was really oily and I thought the menu said spicy but it wasn't.  It was really thin beef with green pepper chunks and sliced onion.  It also came with white rice which seemed old, it was dry.  We also tried to start with crunchy egg rolls and spring rolls, but on this night service was pretty quick so it all came out together.  The service was efficient, and the price was really nice but flavor was lacking, at least for us.  As a family, we gave it a c+ and not coming back.",

I ordered the large rice noodle with beef stew, my husband had the big bowl of pho and we split an order of spring rolls. His food came out within 10 minutes and mine took about another 15 minutes. I didn't mind because I was enjoying the time with family and friends. After our meal was out I placed an order of fried rice to go and thought it would be done and ready by the time we were all done and eating. That didn't happen. I waited 20 minutes AFTER we finished our meal and paid.   Overall food was great, but service wasn't. Next time I'll order the to go food when I'm ordering my meal.",

I shall try, but will most certainly fall well short.  I know it takes hours of first roasting, then gentle simmering of beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices to get that complex, layered, richly verdant bowl of delight. Steam slowly rising off its surface as you lower the vegetable accoutrements into its golden embrace.  Could you go somewhere else for pho? Sure.  Are there better bowls of pho out there? I'm sure there are.  But we're in Phoenix, so why would you?  Best pho I've had in Phoenix. Period.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in...",

    "text": "Bravo!   I live by two, yes TWO kick-ass Vietnamese restaurants! Pho Thanh and Da Vang are by far the best places in Phoenix (that I've been to so far) to enjoy a hearty bowl of delicious pho! If you love pho and haven't eaten here, you're doing yourself a disservice. I had the Da Vang (basically the special that's everywhere else - cuts of beef, cartilage and tripe) and I ordered some Vietnamese meatballs to put in.Every bite of that pho had me sayinh, \"Mmm!\" My friend and I also ordered the egg rolls and a Banh Mi. Yes, we ate like kings. I've had a better Banh Mi, but Da Vang has some of the best Vietnamese egg rolls that I've ever had for sure...and their fish sauce was perfecto! If you always order spring rolls, take a break and try the egg rolls, and don't forget to eat them properly (wrap in lettuce with other veggies served and dip in fish sauce)!   Good gawd, that food was good...  Da Vang is an amazing Vietnamese dive with a friendly staff and wonderful food. It totally surpasses my standards for good pho. Picking between here and Pho Thanh is going to begin to become a tough choice, and I would have to say that they are definitely on even playing fields when it comes to pho. Try both!",
