We have been to Italy twice this year and eating here is just as good. Many of the customers are repeats, and for good reason -- it's a quality place. It has about 20 tables and a four seat bar, the wine list is adequate and the food choices superb. Seafood risotto, several pasta choices, veal and fresh fish are available nightly, and if you try one of the Italian deserts you will be hooked for sure. If you want a quiet, friendly and very memorable Italian meal, this is your choice in Scottsdale for sure.",

    "text": "I was especially happy to have been able to finally dine at Franco's because I've been trying to get into this restaurant for months!  But I always think of it too late and when I call for a reservation they're booked up. And Franco never fails to sound extremely disappointed and sorry that he can't fit us in. Nice problem to have. Anyway now I can see why. This place does everything \"primo\". They gave us a lovely plate of extremely good provolone cheese along with salami and soppressata on the house. I don't know if Franco sent it because it was our anniversary or because I told him that I'd met and worked with his lovely daughter Emma (we're both actresses) or if he sends this treat to everyone. I didn't query the other diners to find out (though I wanted to). But it was amazing! One thing I know EVERYONE gets is the basket of crusty bread and high quality, almost nutty olive oil for dipping. The wine list is also excellent and reasonably priced. Even the Caesar salad stood out, down to the quality of the bread used to make the croutons and the pepper. I don't think I've ever noticed such a difference in black pepper before!  For my entree I went with the pounded veal chop topped with fresh chopped tomatoes and herbs. I'm not usually a veal chop girl but this was pounded so thin it was like a cutlet. It came with a side of fresh veggies but for $3 more you can get a heaping plate of pasta too. Definitely a deal. I had the homemade fettuccine. Yum! My groom chose the Frutti di Mare special which included fresh tuna and calamari and was served over squid ink pasta. He is usually a veal chop boy so I shared some of my generous portion with him. For dessert Franco sent over not one but TWO desserts on the house, along with an anniversary candle. Awww. We got to enjoy some tiramisu and a dreamy cheesy family recipe concoction. I also had a double decaf espresso (which our attentive server David called a \"why bother?\") made with beans from the nearby Coffee Roasters coffee shop in Scottsdale. So awesome!  The only negative I can say is the bar didn't have the makings of a chocolate martini for me. But it's probably best I stay away from martinis anyway.  I cannot wait to go back! And maybe now that summer is approaching and snowbirds are leaving, I'll be able to get in even if I forget to make a res a week in advance!",

There were two tables of about 8 each and they handled both without a problem.  The waiters were amazing and very patient.  They explained any questions we had about the menu very thoroughly and always had a smile on their face.  The food was excellent. I highly recommend the lasagna!  Everyone loved what they ordered.  But the best part of the night is when they dimmed the lights, brought out 3 desserts on a plate  and sang happy birthday!  Franco's hit it on the nose.  Excellent service, quality food, and great atmosphere!  We will be back!  Thanks for making my birthday special!",

The frutti di mari squid ink linguine was very subpar. The linguine and shrimp was over cooked (I would have preferred al dente and flash boiled, respectively), the fish tasted very fishy (it must have been poorly prepared or not fresh), but the calms and cuttlefish/squid was cooked to perfection. We also had a pappardelle with a pork-based ragu style sauce. The pappardelle was dried and not fresh pasta. I had better dried pappardelle at Trader Joes. How does an Italian restaurant with an average of 4.5 stars on yelp not use fresh pasta? Even Safeway sells fresh pappardelle! The ragu was nothing special either; we did not bother to finish it. We moved onto the mascarpone cheesecake, which was awesome; it was light (for a cheesecake), sweet, and not too tart. I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, but based off the pastas, a three is as high as I can go.",

We had a great lasagna dish with meat sauce and it was perfect The sauce was delicious. The cheesecake we had for desert was so fluffy and amazing.

The shrimp and lobster spaghetti was excellent and my halibut was perfectly prepared...so often fish is poorly handled and overlooked. Perfectly moist. The side vegetables and au gratin potatoes were perfect.   For the earlier reviewers who whined about take out (really?) and not being impressed are in a distinct sub minority of the chronically unhappy diners who can never find what they want.  Good for us who can continue to enjoy Franco's charm and comfortable service.  Oh I have not even mentioned the value.  A complete experience.  This is #1 in my book for total experience.  Enjoy!!!",

It doesn't feel like a traditional Italian restaurant since no lasagna, eggplant , or parmesan are on the menu. The menu is like going thru  gauntlets since they don't talk about the sides (or the prices), so it is up to your imagination as to what you get with your entree and what the price is.  Bottom like - VERY MEDIOCRE and no where near the hype....  We can do much better at the Italian Grotto",

For my entree, I tried the linguine with clams in a red sauce.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and complemented with fresh clams (which I always love).  While I thought the entree was good, it could have used a little more sauce and flavor...didn't see any fresh garlic in the dish.  In comparison to other restaurants in the area, the portion was on the smaller side but still adequate by all means.  But this is the case with most restaurants that pride themselves on the quality of their food instead of their portion size.  The restaurant has a good selection of Italian wines by the bottle and glass.  Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant.  The friendly atmosphere and excellent service truly distinguish this restaurant from others.  Franco's is definitely 1 of the top 2 choices for Italian in the Old Town area.  This place is always busy and fairly small so reservations are highly recommended (especially towards the end of the week).",

With our last visit, I was again disappointed with my main course. The rest of our party did enjoy their main course and the appetizer was excellent.

Franco's was a place that I always wanted to go to but have never been able to get a reservation when I've called last minute. (Yes, I tend to procrastinate!!)  Thankfully, I finally got in! My hubby and I were definitely impressed and will absolutely return!  Franco was so kind and welcoming - no fakeness. We could see that he loves his business, his staff and patrons. Thought our italian waiter was exceptional too!  Great service (gave us space but would check on us at the right time), was knowledgeable  but non assuming (unlike many italian and french waiters Ive met at other restaurants at this caliber).   The food was delicious!!!  Loved that they started out out with bread and antipasti (these freebies have gone away from many restaurants which is sad since they really help start the night!).     Husband ordered pasta and refused to share since it was so good. Im always trying to eat low carb and healthy so ordered the chicken and shockingly - this was so flavorful and delicious - for chicken!!!  Because of the reviews, I started with the caprese and like the reviews said- it was also delicious. And they were kind to split it up for us even though we never asked for this.  A definite gem in Scottsdale and better than all the other italian restaurants within 10 miles.",

This is one spot I know for sure if you have a special occasion to celebrate, business meeting, family in town or need a place to hold a party this is the place. The service is always spot on (thanks Dave) and the food always leaves you excited to return because you know it will as good or better then the last time you had it.(always a hit) Most nights you will see Franco himself greeting you and checking in with you which is always a nice added touch because he takes deep sincere pride in his restaurant and it show with every bite of food you take.",

The restaurant has a separate, brick enclosed eating area. Because of how busy they were I was seated in this room. The sounds echo very loudly off the brick and so I got to enjoy the large party next to me and their wild conversations. Back to the food, fresh and well prepared. The prices are a bit high but worth it. I would recommend this mom and pop restaurant for a nice meal out.",

This gives the place a family feel of caring and quality. All of the food is excellent. Often they have a lot of special items not on the menu. My last dish was the best gnocchi I've ever had. The pesto sauce was perfect with cherry tomatoes added as a nice touch. My husband had the pork chop special. It was a generous portion and perfectly cooked.   Service is top notch and pleasant. Our water glasses were always full. Prices are within range of similar places in Scottsdale.  Give it a try if you are visiting the area. Make it one of your go-to places if you are a local.",

Read one of the news articles framed on the wall which indicated Franco had 4 other Italian restaurants in Brooklyn NY. This place is so authentic. Please, if you see a picture on their Yelp page and it's not on the menu, just ask and most often then not, they'll make it for you. My husband and I had both the veal chop with mustard mushroom sauce and chicken parmigiana (both of which were not featured on the menu). They were so delicious, flavors bursting in our mouth  Even if your full you have to try their mascarpone cheesecake- it's worth every calorie. Wait staff was the best, very friendly and attentive and made us feel at home. The establishment is on the smaller side so I recommend you make reservations. Again, this place exceeding our expectation and I'm coming back!",

We were warmly greeted and seated immediately.  Franco graciously shared a lovely meat and cheese plate.  We ordered a nice house Chianti and settled in for an amazing meal in a warm, friendly environment.  We shared the pasta in truffle/cream sauce, meat sauce pasta (Franco's grandmother's recipe) and an AMAZING rack of veal seasoned and cooked perfectly on the rotisserie.  PERFECT meal, start to finish.  The bread was fresh and delicious, the olive oil was great too!  We consider ourselves to be \"foodies\" and would recommend Franco's to anyone lucky enough to get a reservation.  Thanks Franco's for a fabulous meal :)",

    "text": "When we walked in Franco himself greeted us and asked us to pick our table and he surprised us with a very generous plate of thinly sliced prosciutto and cheese. We also received a bread basket with at least four kinds of fresh bread and very high quality olive oil. The menu is interesting and does differ from other Italian Restaurants I've been too but I also wasn't expecting the very long list of added specials to choose from.  We started with the Grilled Vegetable Plate that included a variety of vegetables with the most delicious mushrooms I've ever tasted.  Next we shared one of the house made pastas it was the Fettuccine Tartufo. It really was a WOW dish. The sauce of Black Truffles with some olives was addictive and I found myself sucking the insides of my mouth to keep tasting the sauce. It's not the kind of sauce I normally like but this one was light and not heavy for what it was. The pasta it's self was very thin and light but still had some body to it.  For dinner I had to choose the Halibut special since it is in season now. I was presented with a great plate of well executed food. The halibut was very moist and fresh and was on top of the most simple but most delicious tomatoes with basil I've tasted in a while and it had a little kick to it too. The plate also came with two vegetables and very dreamy layered creamy potatoes. Everything was seasoned so perfect I couldn't say it was too much of something or not enough of something else.   My husband had another one of the specials that was a Veal Scaloppini Dish with a well made sauce that contained cherry peppers.   We tried the Merenghata it a semifreddo between a crisp meringue. The center was cold and like whipped cream and ice cream and the meringue was like a crisp cloud. It seemed very light and was easy to eat.  SIMPLE, fresh well prepared food priced very reasonably.  Franco personally thanked us for coming.  You have to do valet parking because they don't have a parking lot. The valet cost $5.00 before tip. This place is small and busy so you need a reservation.",

Furthermore, Italians typically have a very particular brand of hospitality, and you definitely get a healthy dose of it here.  He stopped by numerous times to speak with us and make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  I had the frutti di mare and it was fantastic.  They make their own pasta every day and it shows...  It's some of the best pasta I've ever had.  The tiramisu is absolutely perfect-- the cake is dripping with coffee and the cream on top is spectacular.

Having been met at the door by Franco himself and graciously seated by same, we knew we were in for a treat. The atmosphere evokes memories of our multiple trips to Italy and a quaint, warm, and inviting ambiance.   The charcuterie and cheese plate brought gratis from Franco started our evening and we knew we were in for wonderful meal and experience. The service (done expertly by Antonio and John) demonstrated their knowledge of the menu, as well as their ability to properly describe the dishes themselves. And every special request was politely honored with a smile and a nod.  The caesar salad was superb, well balanced with each specific flavor able to be identified. Our main course was a special of rabbit ragu with house made paparadelle, which was quite simply one of the best dishes we have had since Italy. We completed our experience with the dessert of Merengata, Franco's grandmothers Christmas cake recipe, that takes him two days to make two dessert cakes! It was unlike any dessert we have ever had and worth every calorie!  Having dined at many Scottsdale Italian restaurants we highly recommend Franco's and encourage you to enjoy a wonderful dining experience here. As Franco's shakes your hand on the way out, you will be glad you did!",

He lead us out the door without mentioning that you are required to make a reservation to dine there. He was very rude and seemed like he could care less about not being able to help us. I am very distraught how we were treated. I am an old town native and frequent very many restaurants in Scottsdale. I have NEVER been treated in such a poor manner.

Upon entering the somewhat small restaurant, Franco greets everyone with a warm smile.  The first thing you notice on the wall to the left of the entrance is a picture of Franco with Andrea Boccelli. During  Andrea Bochelli's last visit to Phoenix, his entourage  ate at Franco's twice!   When I made the reservations for our party of 10, I describe the restaurant to the rest of our party as reminiscent of an older Italian restaurant from San Francisco's in the 1970s.  Once seated, we immediately got to business, ordered a couple bottles of wine as well as a few mixed drinks. Franco provide bruschetta  on the house. The bread was soft and paired very well with the fragrant tomato and olive oil.  After that we enjoyed an appetizer of meats and cheeses that was delicious fresh and quite authentic. They also brought out an assortment of bread with extra-virgin olive oil for dipping. My main meal of squid ink seafood pasta was delicious. It had an enormous amount of different types of seafood such as shrimp halibut and calamari. Flavors were very fresh, but not bold. I also tried to hand made ravioli which was delicious and apparently made six hours earlier. Dessert was an assortment of four or five different types of cakes, all made in house. There was cheesecake, Tiramisu, chocolate cake, you get the picture. They paired very well with the espresso and cappuccino is that we ordered.   Service is very good and quite quick. If I had to choose any faults, it would be that the alcohol beverages and mixed drinks took a little too long to come to the table. As did the espresso/cappuccino.   Valet parking is available in front and comes in handy and is very convenient. If you are a vegetarian, let them know ahead of time and he will make it a splendid meal for you also.",

Upon arrival at the restaurent it really seemed like a hidden gem, as the restaurent was fully booked with many italian families. Franco provided us with a sample menu featuring many of his best pastas and also recommended a number of dishes that were unique. It was such an amazing experience. It felt like being invited to share a meal with their family. Franco even let us sample a slice of cake that was his grandmother's secret recipe. Please do yourself a favor and pay them a visit.",

I'm a native Northeasterner and frequent NYC diner with a passion for authentic Italian food and Franco's lived up to my hopes! Buffalo Mozzarella \"special\" starter with a variety of other yummy items kicked it off WELL! I asked about the ravioli vs the fettuccine tartufo and they were so sweet to put both on my plate! Both amazingly delicious but if I HAD to pick one? The Tartufo, mmmmm! A lot of veal on their menu (I'm a vegetarian with a big soft heart for animals so I didn't care for that but it was an authentic Italian menu for sure!) My husband had a special for his meal and licked his plate clean. Celebrated my birthday here with a combo dessert plate of cheesecake and Governor's chocolate cake which were both fabulous. Started with great martinis and a superb bottle of wine. All in all, great spot! Definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet, authentic, delicious Italian meal!",

They were professional, warm and attentive throughout the meal, making sure that all my needs were met.  The food is authentic, flavorful, and clearly crafted with care (the pasta is handmade!!!!). The highlights of my meal were the fresh caesar salad, the rich and comforting fettuccine with meat sauce, and a heavenly slice of cheesecake (do not leave without this dessert--seriously).   I highly recommend Franco's to anyone looking for fantastic service, high quality food and a pleasant dining atmosphere.",

    "text": "We're new residents of Old Town Scottsdale and have been enjoying exploring the many outstanding restaurants in the area. We were looking forward to Franco's, having tried to get a reservation there several days ago and being told they were booked up for the next four nights. I gave up at the time, but my wife called later and made a reservation for a weeknight the following week. While earlier than we preferred for dinner, she was persuaded to make a reservation for 5:30 p.m. because the later times were booked.  By the time we finished dinner that evening, we said, \"That's a one-time-only place.\" Here are our reasons: (1) We arrived at 5:30 to a nearly empty restaurant, and when we left around 7:00 p.m. it was barely over half full with several empty tables. We felt misled about how busy they are; and (2) The food was so-so at best, but the check for the two of us that included one glass each of Sangiovese, two salads, a pasta dish with no meat, and a below-average sea bass dish came to just under $100 without tip! Ouch!   The only positive note was the fine service. The hostess was pleasant, our waiter was attentive, and a number of other staff members were alert and responsive to us. The person who refilled our water glasses was so attentive that he refilled them almost without fail by the time we had consumed about 1/2 inch of water. We saw his friendly, smiling face many times during the meal.   Franco's seemed a bit like a tired and dated place. While well established, it seemed to lack authenticity, charm, and good Italian food. Our overall recommendation is, \"Don't bother.\"",

First, I want to rave about the authenticity of this place.  I felt like I was in a cozy Italian restaurant in New York instead of in Scottsdale.  What this means is that it was a little crowded and loud, but I kind of loved that!    We started with Caesar salads, which were very fresh and delicious.  I could have used a little more dressing, but overall it was very tasty.  For our meals, we both ordered pasta.  I had the tartufo, and I was so appreciative of their letting me make a couple of changes.  I ordered it without the olives and added shrimp, and it was AMAZING!  I could definitely tell that the noodles were homemade, and the sauce was perfection.  It was a cream sauce but wasn't super heavy like most, and how can you go wrong with truffles, right?!  The shrimp were delicious, and I'm very picky about shrimp.  What was even better was the fact that the tails were off!  I really will never understand why so many restaurants choose to leave the tails on shrimp.  My fiance ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with meat sauce.  The ravioli were impressive--plump and flavorful.  He thought the sauce was a little salty, but I thought it was great, and I'm usually the one who complains about salt.  The desserts looked fantastic, but we did not save room...next time!  We will be back soon!",

I ordered the penne shrimp as an entree and it was absolutely amazing. Shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce was fantastic. As we stood up to leave, Franco came running over and asked us why we didn't order dessert. After we stated we were full, he told us \"absolutely not, sit back down. You have to try my dessert\" and boy he was right. He gave us free slices of flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake.

Service was the best from John and the very friendly bar tenders that catered to us like we were the only ones in the place. Busy Friday night during auction season, we were quickly seated and felt lucky to score a reservation just a few days in advance. The menu is traditional Italian with all of the favorites including virtually any variation or special request that you can imagine. The chefs are very accommodating. We ordered two entrees that weren't on the menu but were suggested by John as options to the five or six specials that evening. Franco's mothers recipes are recreated with love daily and her frozen dessert is over the top. Reasonably priced and so enjoyable was our evening that we returned several night later and did the entire meal over again with some great variations. We can't wait to return next year to this quaint little Italian bistro. Bravo!",

It sits right in the heart of old town Scottsdale and we were so pleased to speak with Franco and discover that he is a real Italian from Tuscany and his food reflects this fact.  The service couldn't have been better.  Franco generously brought us out some prosciutto, salami and a delectable place of veal meatballs with a yummy tomato sauce.  I had the Orecchie elefante which was perfect and my family had homemade pasta in a marinara sauce which was also delicious.  He has very good prices on wine.  Some bottles are only $24.  The restaurant is both casual and elegant.  The food is delicious and the service was friendly and efficient.  What's not to like?",

Prosciutto and Melon was a delicious start then on to the Pasta Herbe Aromatic (cant remember how to spell it) which is some of the best pasta I've ever had...and I've been to Italy twice!...the fish special was Seabass, which I could tell was really great quality, fresh, and authentic.  For dessert the cheesecake was out of this world. Best part, Franco himself was there making sure all the tables were enjoying themselves. I'll be back!",

Everyone was courteous, knowledgable and the food and service were EXCELLENT. The owner, Franco, welcomed us as if we were regular customers (being from Chicago that is tough...BUT we will come back). Franco took the time, even with a packed dining room, to pull the chair for my wife. Prices were reasonable and portions were large. The owner even gave us a 3-item dessert selection--totally complimentary. The service was EXCELLENT...as the hostess, the owner and at least four waiters came to our table to make sure everything was GREAT...and it was. Thanks FRANCO for a wonderful evening and super service and food. Our highest recommendations to anyone who wants good, solid food and a wonderful experience!",

Probably seats no more than 50-60 people, so it's a small place but it's a quiet spot. I ended up getting a mushroom pasta (I cannot remember the name of it to save my life) but it was a menu special for the night. This place beat oreganos, Olive Garden, brio, DeFalcos and every other Italian spot that I have ever been to.

Before we could walk out, Franco came out and insisted he will make room for us. He grabbed 4 menus and walked us to a table himself. The hospitality was remarkable and the food was equally good. Amongst us we got chicken parm, ravioli, and fettuccine and all left saying \"wow\". The marscapone cheesecake is a great twist on the dessert as it is light and delicious.

Always cooked to perfection as requested, with a side of spinach and carrots along with the best fresh cut fries ever. A must have if you're a steak lover as myself.   Just go and experience it yourself. My wife would never go to Italian restaurant, since growing up with her Italian grandmother that lived with the family, when growing up, always cook for the family. So, a family from Italy test your food and love it. It has to be the best! And don't forget his homemade deserts...",

The whole experience was absolutely wonderful! Would definitely recommend and will go again if we make it back to Scottsdale.",

Like me, you'll be back again & again. Franco, his team + kitchen delivers sumptuous excellence day after day & year after year. My goal is to eventually try everything on their wonderful menu. I've been addicted to quality Italian food all my life. I've been to Italy 3 dozen times & Florence at least 2 dozen times for business & pleasure. As a New Yorker most of my life I've dined at hundreds of Italian Restaurants. I assure you you will never, ever, anywhere enjoy a better Italian meal. Franco's kitchen prepares the best pastas, meats, fishes, appetizers to deserts you'll find anywhere on the planet ~ period! Two nights ago I brought a dear friend who had just arrived from London. We had a mere day and a half of business together so, I truly needed to assure him a few wonderful meals. First-Stop: FRANCO's and both our meals were divine. From the flawless Umbria wine we had to fresh mozzarella + tomatoes & salad, baked asparagus + prosciutto, seafood pasta to the Merenghata (his grandmother's prized desert recipe) Franco again delivered the best meal with relaxed smiles & a wonderful evening. Touche Franco!!!",

I had a squid linguini special, which had various of the usual shellfish and squid, and in addition, nice large pieces of grouper, my favorite fish.  Everyone else thought their dishes were superb.      Franco himself is present, mostly in the kitchen, but also visiting tables to be sure that everyone is having a fine time.

    "text": "Oh my goodness, its almost been 24 hours and I am still thinking about the delicious dinner I had last night.  I honestly cannot remember the last time I had such an amazing dinning experience.  I've definitely been to some of the nicer places in Scottsdale and while Franco's may not be as flashy (which gets very old, very fast) everything- from the ambiance, the wait staff, and ESPECIALLY the food was amazing and unique.  It probably helps that the restaurant is family owned and the owner is actually on-site- making sure everything is perfect.  There was literally not one element that I found less than satisfying, the olive oil was extremely fresh, the pasta to die for, and the porterhouse was probably the best I've ever had (and oh my goodness, don't even start me on dessert!)  I would be more descriptive about what I ate but I can't properly spell it all- all I know is that the pasta I ate was named the strangled priest (English translation) and the sauce was a recipe given to the restaurant's owner from a lady who lived on a mountain top in Italy. The environment is very un-Scottsdale.  This is the kind of place you'd envision a character in a romantic comedy taking his date in New York or San Francisco... small, intimate, and charming but it's family friendly as well.  It can get a little loud but that just adds to the familial air of the place. I could still hear my dining companion throughout the evening, so it was not bothersome at all.   Highly, highly recommended!",

The set up of the restaurant is all wrong.  There are too many tables packed into too small of a space and there is not enough room between the tables.  As a result, the servers, who were running all around, seemed like they were squeezing in and out of tight spaces the whole time.  When we first arrived, we went to the bar and there was a table bordering the bar.  Pretty strange.  We actually got seated pretty quickly and the server was good considering how busy they were.  The food however was average at best.  We both ordered salads which were ok, but we must have waited 25-30 minutes in between our salads and entrees.  I ordered one of the specials: the black spaghetti pasta with clams, ahi tuna, calamari, and shrimp.  My wife got the raviolis with meat sauce.  Maybe we ordered wrong or maybe the food was sub-par because they were so busy, but I was expecting a lot more.  Both of us were disappointed given the reviews and the price.  We probably won't go back.",

Simply the best in AZ in every way shape and form.  No one in town can compete with his veal and pasta!!  The competition is all trying to figure out how to deliver NY quality Italian food and they all fall way short of Franco.  Yes it is a busy place but where do you ever see the boss working his tail off 6 days a week making sure each and every patron is completely satisfied.  We dine there every week and the complete staff is super friendly and truly wants to see everyone enjoy the experience.  If you know what high quality Italian tastes like then you will arrive with a smile and leave with a bigger smile.  One of the TOP SECRET dishes that comes out of the kitchen is the Orrechie Elephante - pounded breaded veal chop (EJS style).  This will be parmigiana style with his outstanding Bolognese sauce.  After this dish you will never need to see his menu again.  Go make your reservation immediately!!  Eric S. - Scottsdale",

The menu is really good too. I loved their capellini tomato basil. The service was extremely good. They are prompt and very polite.  Overall a really great experience!

    "text": "Blink and you will miss it. Franco's Italian Cafe is tucked away on Scottsdale Road and if you live in the area you have probably driven by it multiple times without even realizing it. Working right next door, I searched the restaurant online and was stunned to discover that it is one of the highest rated restaurants so I had to try it. For those expecting a heavy, large Italian meal, be warned, this is not an upscale Buca di Beppo. Franco's is a very traditional Northern Italian restaurant. Having visited Italy, I can tell you, that this will instantly transport you back there. If you have not been to Italy, this is a great representation of the type of food you can expect in the Northern part of the country.  What does this mean? The fig, prosciutto and mozzarella appetizer was light and delicious. The bread was served with olive oil, but is unseasoned; it is simply a vehicle for getting leftover sauce in your mouth. The Caesar salad was a no frills classic Caesar: fresh pepper, crisp romaine, and a light delicious dressing. I had to try the homemade pappardelle and wild boar.  It was absolutely delicious and did not leave me feeling overly heavy. My family got a variety of dishes from homemade squid ink pasta to veal. Everyone raved.   Now on to dessert. We tried one of each. The Tiramisu and chocolate cake were delicious as expected. The Meringata was a dessert I had never tried before, but it was an absolutely stunning combination of frozen Italian meringue. I would highly recommend it. However, the showstopper had to be the luscious mascarpone cheesecake. I had never had cheesecake made with mascarpone before and I can undoubtedly say that it might be one of the best things I have ever had the pleasure of eating. It will ruin all other cheesecakes for you.  As so many others have said before me, 10/10, a must visit.  Make a reservation as it is a small restaurant and can get very busy.",

I always have the best experience when I go - they're so sweet and welcoming when you get there, it's like being at home.  Every item on the menu is so good, I swear you can't go wrong with anything. Burrata is creamy goodness and melts in your mouth ahhh my mouth is watering as I write this.  When it comes to pasta, I'm a creature of habit and always order the Rigatoni Paisan, which is an off the menu dish and is seriously so good. It comes with a habanero pink sauce, rigatoni and sausage - it's so simple but so freaking delicious. They can change the spice level depending how spicy you want it, but seriously, if you like spicy food then this is the dish for you! I just had it last week and I think I might go back for more this week!  The seafood pasta is another delicious dish - so flavorful and LOTS of seafood.  And we always finish with limoncello. Who doesn't love a good shot of limoncello!? Such a great and fun experience every time we're here, I promise you will not be disappointed!",

The restaurant was still fairly busy but we were seated and given prompt service very quickly. The staff was very friendly and enjoyed talking about Italian cuisine.  For our appetizer, we got the Prosciutto & Melone which was very refreshing. It was the right blend of salty and sweet and the lemon juice made it even better.  We got the seafood risotto, chicken contadina, and a seafood pasta with squid ink. All of them were delicious but our favorite was the squid ink pasta. All of them are recommended!  For dessert, we got the mascarpone cheesecake and the meringata. The cheesecake was great but the highlight was definitely the meringata. If you never tried it before, you should; it is like a mix of ice cream and cake   Overall I would suggest trying out this restaurant if you're craving Italian food in the Scottsdale area!",

The menus that have been uploaded under photos for this restaurant is very different from the menu we were given, I've uploaded the same. The restaurant has a formal ambience, so wouldn't recommend going there with friends (chatty ones like me). Could be a nice place for a date night, but again- formal (attire is casual but the vibe isn't). You'll mostly see seniors eating there. We got the Fettuccini & Rigatoni. I liked the Rigatoni better, we had to add extra salt to the Fettuccine. Plus, had to had Parmesan which they don't recommend, but it tasted so much better with it! We also had wine, okay. For dessert we had the layered chocolate cake which wasn't bad. Only concern is the price range considering the decor and seating and the whole ambience of the place. Be prepared to shell out approx $60 for two minus the drinks if you're vegetarians (two entree & one dessert). It could be more if you're ordering meat. Our came to $83 with two drinks. Doesn't hurt to give this place a shot. Service is great!",

I guess many people wanted to get one last dinner before he closes for 1 month. We started with a wonderful Pinot Grigio suggested by Franco which went very well with the caprese salad with proscuitto and figs. For dinner three of us had the Fruitti di Mare with squid ink pasta. This is always a special and always fantastic. The bowl is loaded with fresh seafood, clams, jumbo shrimp, mussels, calamari, white fish with a great light fish stock, tomato sauce. My husband had the lamb osso bucco, another special, and it was huge. So large he could only eat half and had to take the other half off the bone in order to get it in the largest to go container they had. For dessert I had to have my favorite the Merenghata. It's like having a very light ice cream cake with a thin meringue outer shell. So hard to describe but so delicious. We also ordered the tiramisu which is also one of our favorites along with the best espresso outside of Italy. The service is always perfection as is the food. I already have reservation for 5 of us on July 27th and we can't wait.",

Franco himself sat us when we came in and thanked us for coming out that evening when we left. Little touches like that are a rarity when dining nowadays so it is such a delight when it happens.   The elegant atmosphere and warm mood of the Franco's is a date night dream. But, also, makes for a great place to treat the family, have a special birthday, or impress out-of-town guests.  We had the Bufala Mozzerella and Tomato, Fettuccine Tartufo (with real truffles), and the special, which was Ricotta & Spinach Dumplings in a Bolognese sauce. All pastas are made in-house and the sauces are full of flavor.  Everything was wonderful but the real star is the Merenghata. It is worth the trip alone! It was so light and airy. Combined with the juxtaposition of cold melting-in-your-mouth Semifreddo and the crispy Meringue outside -- this dessert is beyond DEVINE! We also were given a sample of the Mascarpone Cheesecake. It was delicious as well, creamy with just a little hint of a tang.   With over 50 years in the restaurant business, you can almost taste all the history with each dish you have at Franco's!",

I did have bread, it was just softer than I wanted. Again a hedonistic fatty complaint. The pasta trio was amazing. I could have stopped there but I didn't. I kept eating. Steak cooked and seasoned to perfection and the. Mascarpone cheesecake (now ranking #2 on my list of cheesecake perfection) and some almond dessert that I'll never remember the name of but was amazing and so delicious. I'll go back and stuff my face again. And again.",

A plus that it doesn't have to be a heavy Italian pasta dinner if you don't want it to be.  I went with a group of about 16 and we sat in a nice private area by the entry. The wine and tequila flowed all dinner. To start we enjoyed sampler type platters. The buffalo mozzarella was heaven. The cantaloupe and meats paired outstandingly.   For my main I had the rack of lamb. Four nice size lamb medallions cooked to medium rare perfection and bursting with flavor. Some of the best I've ever had. The assortment of vegetables that came on the plate were YES.   For desert we had a sampler of all the deserts, with the cheesecake and the tiramisu being the hits. The tiramisu was melt in your mouth disintegrating coffee perfection.    Can't wait to come back and try the pork chop!",

This is how serious I am about this restaurant: I was in Scottsdale for two nights. I went here with colleagues on my first night in town and it was so good I went back the next night by myself. That's saying something b/c I was really looking forward to getting some authentic Mexican food while I was in the SW!    It's not big, new, or slick, and I mean all that in a good way.

It is closed on Sunday & Monday and also closes at some point in the summer for several weeks. Everything we ordered was delicious and we all decided it was the best Italian meal we'd ever tasted!  Not to mention,  we were treated royally.  The salads:  I had the arugula with golden beets & the others had house or Cesar salads.  The dressings were just the right amount and delicious!  Our waiter brought fresh bread and olive oil for dipping and we also used the bread to soak up what was left on our salad plates.  Franco, the owner treated us with a small plate of shaved Parmesan and 3 different types of meats.  We were hooked.   I ordered fettuccine with bolognese sauce.  The pasta was fresh and tossed with Franco's mother's meat sauce recipe. My friend had fettuccine tartufo,  a rich creamy sauce with truffles.  Amazing!!  Our husbands each had the mixed seafood special with black ink angel hair pasta.  Another hit!  Before we knew it,  the waiter brought us a sample of cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake.  We devoured both, which were wonderful,  but we'd been eyeing the Merenghata being served at nearby tables.  It didn't disappoint.  It's hard to describe, so you must try it.  It looks like a large slice of light strawberry cake.  The cake part tastes a mixture of cheesecake and ice cream, which we later learned was amaretto whipped with egg whites, similar to a frozen meringue.  The outside was layered with crispy toasted lady fingers.  It's very light and delicately flavored. Yum!!  Next Franco treated us to shots of limoncello, we were having the time of our lives:)).   Franco's also has a nice wine list and we tried a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, Edge by Ray Signorello of Napa Valley.   We will be searching for this bottle when we return home.   Don't miss this opportunity, make your reservations now.",

I love veal piccata and when the waiter mentioned that, although it wasn't on the menu, they could also do a veal piccata, I was thrilled.  It was the best veal piccata that I have ever had.  The balance of the veal, the lemon and the capers was so perfect.  Wow! I had the pasta erbe Aromatiche and it almost tempted me away from the veal.  I'm going to have a hard time deciding what to have the next time we go!  Love it!",

Unfortunately, the dinner was good, but not spectacular.    We started with the grilled calamari and the polenta appetizers.  The calamari were four small pieces placed on some arugula.  Polenta was served with gorgonzola and is less firm than I am used to.  The polenta came after the calamari and was not as warm as it should be.  Probably was sitting for a bit.    For dinner, we had the veal chop, the rigatoni special and the seafood risotto.  Seafood risotto was probably the best out of the three.  All good, but not great.  Risotto was just right and creamy.  Rigatoni was made with a chicken and leek ragu.  Pasta was cooked al dente as it should be, but the dish was a bit too dry.  I don't like a lot of sauce, but this was not even enough to flavor the whole pasta.  Dish was a little bland.  The veal chop was cooked to my liking, but was not as tender or full of flavor as I would expect at this restaurant.  Still waiting to find a really good Italian restaurant in this town",

However, deciding what to order was becoming challenging until my girlfriend suggested we order family style. Our waiter, Antonio, was more than happy to accommodate our request. We ordered the lamb chops, veal, sea bass and a pasta trio.  Needless to say the food quality and presentation were absolutely incredible. For desert, we went old school Italian, cheeses and fruit accompanied by cappuccinos for everybody.  Once again, simply delightful.

I came to Franco's to meet a few of my friends for dinner on a Tuesday evening and was running a bit later than the rest of my group.  I arrived to the warm welcome of Franco and Leela and was escorted to the table where my friends had already been seated.  Everything about the evening was lovely, the delicious food (I had the pleasure of tasting the Caesar salad, which was the best I've ever eaten, as well as the Frutti di Mare which, again, was breathtakingly delicious), the service, and the ambience.  I felt attended to while at the same time free to enjoy my food and conversation without interruption.  I was so impressed that I even took an entree \"to-go\" home to my boyfriend who was not able to come that evening.  He ordered the 1/2 rack of lamb and, even though it came to him after a bit of a drive in the car, he thoroughly enjoyed it and will be sure to come in person in the future.    I would recommend to anyone looking to have a evening to remember.  I will surely be back!",

Franco and David welcomed him inside out of the 106 degree Arizona heat and made sure he was hydrated and comfortable even though he wasn't a paying customer at that time. That won my respect immediately since this restaurant is known for being quite upscale and posh. They could have easily left him out there and been irritated by the \"inconvenience\" - instead they were understanding and caring.  Hubby, after reading the menu and being a True lover of all things Italy (having been there, not lying, 40+ times during his career in the Navy), made reservations so we could celebrate our pregnancy graduating to the second trimester over a romantic dinner.  We got there, were greeted by the hostess and Franco. David sat us immediately and we were served bread and perhaps the most amazing high quality olive oil I've ever tasted.  We started with the Caprese. The mozzarella was incredible. HUGE pieces of incredible flavor that melted in your mouth in joy inducing deliciousness. Fresh basil, perfectly ripened tomatoes, PERFECT greens lightly touched in a refreshing vinaigrette.   Hubby ordered the salmon Cesar salad. I ordered the House Mista. Both of us were in absolute heaven with our respective salad choices. They were simply exquisite. Nothing cheap. Huge.   For dinner? Hubby ordered the ricotta and spinach Ravioli with a tomato basil sauce. I ordered the Fettuccine in meat sauce.  ... There was a lot of bliss to be had. The tomato basil was loaded with chunks of resplendent roasted garlic and the ravioli large and stuffed beyond compare with an amazing filling worthy of awards.  And when I tasted my own fare? Angels sang. In my mouth.   The flavor note are dramatic, but light. They're refreshing and crisp and fail to be the assault that Sicilian food tends to hold.... Trust me. I LOVE Sicilian, but Franco's offers True north western Italian flavor. Florentine flavor. Unique in every way and fantastic in the way that it's bucked and broken free of the often mundane Italian food stereotype of Chicken Parm and pizza. No. This was heaven, packed and perfectly presented as art, on warmed white plates.  We HAD to have desert after this. Had to. I the Merenghata which David touted was Franco's grandmother's own special recipe. Hubby? Indulged in the Tiramisu; Franco's own mother's recipe.  The flavors, like everything else, were bold and beautiful. The Tiramisu light and soft, the Merenghata sweet and lavish, it's frozen core refreshing against the hot Arizona evening.   All in all? 5 stars. I wish I could give it 10. I wish I could give more and do more for this restaurant for it's truly a gem and perhaps the best Scottsdale has to offer.   If you haven't tried it? DO IT! You have nothing to lose and an experience that pleased every single one of your senses to gain.  And to Franco and David? My eternal thanks for taking such good care of my husband when he landed on your doorstep.   You have our business for life.",

Post up at a corner table with fresh pressed white linens and make sure you wear roomy pants!   I've been here a few times with the same group of friends and I love the feel when you walk into the place. It's a quaint and intimate restaurant and make sure to make a reservation or be prepared to wait. If you opt for the latter - no worries- it's worth it!  Starting off with their traditional bruschetta is a must! The perfect concoction of simple spices, fresh tomatoes and onions, is to die for. I am personally not a huge fan of tomatoes, but I can't help but gobble them up in this dish. Simple delicious! Next try the bufala mozzarella and tomato, your tastebuds will thank you! Now on to the main course; pasta! Franco wakes up and makes homemade pasta every morning, and the fruits of his labor show! Any pasta dish you choose, will be sure delight you and send you into full comfort mode. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide on what to indulge in, so we decided to order two plates and share them. We dug into a heaping helping of the chicken contadina, and the filet. Perfectly cooked, fresh ingredients and we left with happy tummies... But not before dessert! Limoncello and the best mascarpone cheesecake I've ever put on a fork-completely fantastic, creamy and not too sweet.  Service has always been consistently on point and fun. Every server seems enthusiastic about the menu and the time and care that goes into preparing things.   Nestled in an old building in downtown Scottsdale, this place is perfect for a night out on the town with friends or a date!   Ciao!",

My husband and I have been here quite a few times and every time, we are made to feel like returning family.  Franco watches over his guests as if he is hosting a party at his own home.  Any restaurant owner who treats his/her restaurant like their own home and their guests like family is a winner in my book.  And the food is so authentic and not overly indulgent.  They always have really good specials and will make you a classic even if it isn't on the menu (my husband always wants chicken parm, which isn't always on the menu).  We haven't ever had to order dessert because Franco usually brings us a nice sampling of all of the dessert cakes.  Thank you, Franco!  We love this place and hope you do, too.",

The food is superb: the steak Florentine, which was perfectly seasoned and prepared, is hands-down the best I have ever had. However, we were equally impressed with the service. The restaurant is family-owned, and the owners take a genuine interest in their patrons' dining experience. Franco came by to make sure everything was to our liking, and Franco's daughter surprised us with dessert and limoncello for our anniversary. I cannot recommend the place highly enough. Go--you will be so glad you did!",

Fine delicate layers and perfect toppings - tomato basil or meat sauce - whichever suits your preference. Terrific desserts and coffee, as well.

Artichoke salad over a bed of arugula with endive chips and shaved Parmesan it was delightful.  My husband at the house salad with was just a basic green salad with light Italian vinaigrette it was great too.  Husband ordered the shrimp Penny and he enjoyed it very much. They use real Sicily Italian recipes we just thoroughly enjoyed it. Great atmosphere, great service, great food ......great night.

There aren't a lot of small, traditional Italian restaurants in the area so this already gives Franco's one leg up.    The ambiance is small and intimate but also somewhat noisy and crowded since it's a tiny restaurant.  The service is great!  The waiters are older, well experienced in the food industry with a great understanding of the menu items and nightly specials.    The menu is very traditional Italian because there aren't any descriptions the items.  The waiter will reveal several nightly specials which all sounded superb and I recommend ordering one of the specials if they sound good to you.  I have a sea bass special with roasted tomatoes and spinach. It was so delicious!  One of the best fish dishes I have had a restaurant.  I also had a marinated artichoke salad to start which was great and tasty but probably not memorable.  The bread basket isn't worth your time so just save room for the main course!",
