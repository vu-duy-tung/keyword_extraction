    "text": "I've been thinking about what I ordered from this lovely coffee shop since the day I first set foot in it about 2 weeks ago. I was planning on an afternoon at the movies but thought this seemed like a cool place to hang and get a quick bite before the movie. I met my friend here and we ordered: Hot chocolate & English muffin with egg, cheese, tomato and avocado. I know it doesn't sound like anything crazy amazing but it was a cool day and we wanted something warm while we caught up. First off, the hot chocolate took a little bit but when I got it I immediately understood why. It was incredibly creamy and incredibly chocolatey, basically the best hot chocolate I've ever tried, or at least definite top 3! My breakfast sandwich was A) a really nice big size and B) absofreakinglutely (yes, it's a word) Dee-lish!! Wow! The english muffin tasted as if it had just been baked, it was utterly soft and fresh in every way, the egg, the avo, everything about this sandwich was crazy good. I will be back to have both these items in the future again and again. The cookies looked amazing but I was trying not to eat sweets that day but being a crazy cookie person, I will surely have some next time. What a cool space overall. You can sit outside in the sun and people watch or sit inside on their super comfy couch and walk around the gallery area. Very cool find. Just go people reading this, go now.",

I had received a free coffee voucher to use here and decided to check it out. I ordered a coffee and the Nutella, banana, and sea salt bread and showed the guy at the counter my voucher... He said \"okay\" and proceeded to charge me! He wasn't very friendly and seemed like he didn't want to be there. Disappointing! I'd like to try this location again because the food and coffee were great, I just wish I could say the same about the staff!",

An artsy little spot, counter serve cafe, providing local roasts, free wi-fi also serving breakfast all day and lunch sandwiches.  Once you walk in Be is located on the right extending some seats to part of the mOnOrchid Gallery. The building is also shared to wonderful work spaces up stairs also, to a cute little botanical shop for all your plant needs. I like how things are very minimal from the menu board to the counter even the baristas and clerks are a breath of fresH air, and definitely friendly and customer service orientated. Definitely one of my favorite spot, on Roosevelt row coffee and can' beat a delicious breakfast sandwich. Iced americano, all black cause if you are a coffee taster then you wouldn't need any dairy or sugar! Breakfast sandwich was superb! Avocado, Tomato and Munster cheese on a crisp fresh baked English muffin was awesome. Be you, be Awesome, and be hungry Phoenix, be at be technically!",

We had a chorizo scramble, BE Hammy and toast with Nutella, banana and sea salt. We really enjoyed all except the toast. My 8 year old thought it was a bit too salty for her. My husband tried it and agreed it was too salty.   Our cappuccinos were among the best we've had and we've had them in Italy!    Decor was very simple contemporary. The art work nearby of the naked woman drew some questions from our daughter but we didn't make a big deal so neither did she. Just a warning tho.   Thanks!  Enjoyed ourselves a lot.",

    "text": "Awesome location, great service, friendly staff, an affordable menu, and my new-favorite cold brew coffee. Be Coffee + Food + Stuff is brand new to the downtown Phoenix and Roosevelt Row scene and has certainly hit the ground running on all cylinders.  I've yet to try any of the food, but it's definitely on my list. I've heard nothing but good things from a number of people that I trust. I'm also familiar with the owners and have experienced their knack for delicious food first-hand.  I mentioned the cold brew: if you're a coffee nerd like I am, you can rest assured knowing that Be Coffee + Food + Stuff uses premium locally-roasted beans and brews the cold brew for a solid 24 hours before serving. And you can tell! It's my new go-to.  The location is small, but it has been laid out really well, providing a surprising amount of space given its size. It's also set within one of the coolest buildings in Phoenix and opens right up into a couple of tiny retail stores and a well-known gallery (open to the public), which makes for a fun visit.  Parking appears somewhat of an issue at first blush, but I was happy to find that there was plenty of free street parking all around the building. E Portland Street, directly behind the building, is your best bet if you can't manage to snag a spot in the lot.  Do yourself a favor and check these guys out if you haven't already had the opportunity to visit. I know I'll be going back!",

I think it was housemade. We ordered chorizo scramble and a breakfast egg sammy. It took 20 minutes to make (we had the only food orders) and they forgot to put it in to go containers as requested. Both were okay. The sammy is definitely sizeable but not a lot of flavor. I got the one with avocado and there was minimal avocado in it. The scramble chorizo is not heavy as expected - in a good way. I like the vibes here and what they are trying to offer but alas, they never hit the nail on the head.",

The English muffin (house made?) combined with the muenster cheese, giant pile of scrambled eggs and healthy dab of mayo was simply astounding!  Next time we find ourselves in Phoenix, this is a definite stop.  And I just loved that it was right next to an adorable little shop, I think it was called The Bosque. All around a great experience.",

So we saw this place was right down the street and thought \"what the heck it has 5stars let's give it a try?!\" So we walked in an immediately are met with a warm smiles. We ordered 3 breakfast plates,2 lattes and a huge breakfast pastry that only cost roughly 30$. While we waited for our food and coffee we browsed the art gallery, which was unique and entertaining. When The food arrived, it was hot, fresh, massive portions and Delicious!! I definitely will be back! It's a new coffee shop but it definitely earned my loyalty.",

Once I got my food and left the same barista waved me goodbye. They have a good student discount so not only was it reasonable but delicious as well.

    "text": "One of those rare occasions where you'll find me at a coffee spot.  Not for the coffee (still don't drink coffee), but for the food.  The restaurant space in the MonOrchid (formerly occupied by Songbird) is now run by the staff at Be.  The super positive early reviews and a Saturday morning hankering for a hearty breakfast got me in the door.  Arriving at 7am, I was the first customer of the day.  Just as when Songbird occupied this space, its beautiful.  Comfy couch seating for some, cafeteria style for others, and additional overflow seating upstairs and around the corner in the MonOrchid space.  If you've never been to the MonOrchid I recommend coming by and checking it out at least once.  There's a reason so many weddings and other big groups events are held here.  And the artwork is pretty impressive as well.  But let's get back to Be's business.  Like I said, not a coffee drinker, but I was curious about their breakfast repertoire.  The English Egg Sammy with Ham and Muenster cheese sounded like a good starting point.  To pair it, I went with their Nutella toast (made with MJ Bread from Tammie Coe) with banana and sea salt.  First off, the Sammy is huge (like twice the size of your usual store brand english muffin) and had at least two eggs in there (probably three).  The muenster cheese was a great contrast for the ham as well.  The homemade nutella they make in house for the toast is awesome.  Kinda wish the bread slices were a little bigger, but no complaints about the nutella whatsoever.  Total price for the Sammy, the Nutella Toast, water and tax came to about $14.  Perhaps a little steep, though I can't complain about the quality of the ingredients or the super friendly staff.  Like a lot of coffee houses, this is the sort of place you could just relax and spend hours here mingling, studying, or even just taking in the aesthetics of the building itself.  And hey if the early reviews are any indication, the coffee must be good too.  I'm just glad to find a coffee spot with more than just great coffee.",

This place is inside a building called the monorchid which is filled with local businesses each claiming their own niche inside. This coffee shop and the plant store next door are the only businesses selling a product vs a service. The reason for 3 stars is partly due to this close business thing they have going on. Any time I've gone in, the same people are here working on a laptop, taking up the entire table, and conversing with each other. This is a coffee shop, should be normal right? Well I found these people are workers from the surrounding businesses. Since their office space is so small, sometimes with no door, they come hang at the coffee place all day. As I sit in the corner I see many customers come in looking for a spot to settle in, but end up having to do take out or walk out all together.    The sandwiches are so delicious and every time I've been there I've received some type of coffee art. There are a couple cool historic books on the table to check out while sipping on your drinks.q",

I honestly chose \"Be\" because (no pun intended) for the cute decor and furnishings.   When I got in the green logo on the cups looked familiar . I didn't know where I had seen it until I sat down and overheard who I think was one of the owners being interviewed by a lady and he explained that they had something to do with Royal at the Market and then it clicked . I think they had those cups there !   The cashier / Barista was super friendly and shook my hand when meeting him. My only complaint was that he completely forgot to make our drinks so it took about 10 mins without anyone else ahead of us. He did redeem himself however by giving us free coffee cards for next time for the long wait .  I LOVE the space ! It is shared with Bison leather goods, Monorchid, and a cute succulent place with the calmest Boxer I have ever met . JB Snyder's work is on the wall and ties in the furnishings . So cute . The food also looked fantastic, but I didn't try it .",

Hubby said he was surprised that the chorizo was Spanish and not Mexican, but he liked it in his chorizo scramble, which he got without the spinach. Seriously friendly staff here, too!

I started out with the Chorizo Scramble and a drip coffee. The scramble is amazzzingggg. Just get it. Coffee was strong, just how I like it.   The vibe is cool, gallery, meets hipster, meets desert modern loft, sometimes that's off putting frankly cause it isn't always friendly. The baristas here though, they are. So are your fellow hanger outers, working from whereverers etc.   I worked from here for a few hours and the staff checked on me a few times, I purchased a coffee refill or two, had some water etc.",

The answers are \"yes\" and \"2\".  The service is outstanding for a coffee shop!  The girl at the register was super informative and helpful in answering my questions and making recommendations.  The barista made a fantastic-tasting espresso drink.  And another gentleman even approached us and asked if we would like a food menu or to be seated for dinner.    And Be also happens to have an art gallery as well!  We chose a seat on a couch with a view of many of the art pieces.  Wow... this is the kind of place that I will probably end up spending countless hours getting my caffeine on and being while being productive with work!  I cannot wait to actually try some food items off of their menu.  I mean, have you seen the pictures and other reviews?!?  The sandwiches look and sound amazing!  I'm in love with Be.  *****FIVE STARS*****",

Snacks n such: 4.5 stars Big fan of their toasts--simple ingredients, but very well chosen. They're connected to a nearby bakery, whose name escapes me, but it's good stuff. Plus their cookies are huge and tasty (a wonderful combination).   Atmosphere: 5.0 stars Love the area.

The sandwich is actually one of the best I've had and quite possibly the heaviest. The scramble was good but I think the portion was a bit insufficient. My boyfriend was still hungry after finishing it. Therefore we ordered an apple cinnamon fritter (?) and the spicy cold brew. The gentleman at the cashier who is a friend of the owner (who was AWESOME, super witty and hilarious) recommended the cinnamon fritter and quite honestly I wasn't terribly impressed. Overall, the coffee is great, the atmosphere chill and hipster-y, and it's attached to a restaurant and an art gallery which just means you get to enjoy the beautiful artwork while you wait for your food. For free! Absolutely recommend anyone and everyone to stop by.",

The young blonde girl working was SO SO SO nice and really made our day. She was so personable and sweet, we really enjoyed talking to her.

It's a small space, but offers the rustic, unfinished, hipster vibe we all crave when looking for a great coffee spot.   We both ordered a 12 oz hot latte and the tomato, avocado and egg breakfast sandwich. The latte had a great, smooth espresso flavor and the sandwiches were HUGE and so tasty!!   If you get a chance to try this place, definitely do it. Also, their customer service was fantastic. Troy immediately greeted us and took the time to get to know us when he brought out our orders...very nice guy!   Will be back next time we travel to Phoenix!",

The service was friendly, and I was happy to have someone come and collect my \"trash\" after I was done (being a first-time visitor I was having mild anxiety over where to put it!).   My only gripe would be the somewhat limited seating, but it's a small place.  *I was also happy to discover a little plant store, The Bosque Phoenix, that is essentially an extension of the coffee shop.

The inside shows really well, open roof space, showing off old-school bowstring trusses. Lots of professionally presented art. Cool meeting space, cool picnic style tables. I stepped up to the counter at 10:00 am on a Monday to order a bite to go, wanted the signature eggsammy on English muffin. I was told they were all out of ham (somebody better do that grocery run because lunch starts in an hour).They have maybe 6 or 7 breakfast options, that are really variations of 3 things, sandwich, toast, and oatmeal. Similar thing on the lunch menu).... Anyway they offered turkey, I wasn't down so I selected cup of coffe with ricotta cheese, cherry jam, and MJ toast, (fancy bread from a spclty bakery) order took over 10 min. I felt ripped off, see photo... One un-toasted pc of Texas toast, with a table spoon of jam and ricotta chese($3.75), and they were out of made coffee...more waiting...  No ham, no Splenda, solo egg whites are not an option, and no fresh coffee....I hope they figure it all out, because the space wants to be hung out in.....",

The food is consistent and good. The staff are super nice and very accommodating.   The bakery items are fresh made and tantalizing. The breads come daily made by a local bakery. Additionally, they support our local businesses for their ingredients; Schreiner's Fine  Sausage and many others. The inside of the business is super cool and showcases a rustic industrial feel infused with art.  When I walked in, the vibe of this place grabbed me right away. It is one of those spots that appeal to my inner nature and like of industrial areas. Biff and Erma do-gooder's from Scottsdale need not venture here. Most of them are not too hip. You might kill the vibe as well. PS- Stay in Scottsdale and wear your polo shirt, Sperry top-siders and shorts with the matching belt. That is good place for you.   Anyway, this is a great place to chill out, read the paper and take in some cool aspects of downtown Phoenix. We love to just walk around hand in hand and soak up the local businesses and fare. Come try out this awesome joint...  #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate #vino2",

The inside is very cute and quaint with enough seating for the place. It's open and airy with a lot of plants around. The vibe is pretty mellow and welcoming. The employee who took our order was very nice and offered recommendations.   Overall, it's a great place to grab a drink/bite to eat and relax at.

Set inside the MonOrchid building, Be Coffee is a cozy little area that shares space with a plant store and an art gallery towards the back. The menu offers breakfast, lunch, and a delightful selection of coffee drinks and tea. After having a small sample of the spicy cold brew I knew I needed this for my meal! It had just the right kick of spiciness from the inclusion of habaneros and Fresno chiles, and was lightly sweet. The coffee itself was so smooth I didn't even need any cream or milk to go with it.   As for the \"+ Food\", I had the avocado-tomato English muffin breakfast sandwich. It was a very generous portion, and oh so good. The English muffin was lightly toasted, with fluffy soft eggs, fresh avocado and tomato. The acidity from the tomato and the light saltiness from the muenster cheese was an excellent counterpoint to balance out the creamy flavors of the avocado and eggs. My total for the coffee plus the sandwich was around $12.   Service was so friendly and sweet. Another plus of this restaurant is that there is a private parking lot in the back.   \"B(e)\" Coffee definitely gets an \"A+\" in my book!",

The service and atmosphere at Be Coffee are both excellent. From those behind the counter taking your order while introducing themselves to the owner who often serves up guests himself, everyone is excellent, and the atmosphere and decor is one of the most unique I've encountered. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The menu at Be Coffee is small, but nothing on it is above $10.00. My scramble was small, but for $9.00 I was perfectly content with the fresh ingredients. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  My chorizo breakfast scramble was simple, but excellently so. The chorizo was fresh, the eggs flavorful, and the cheese and mustard brought it all together nicely. As I touched on earlier, the portion was small, but the dish was good. Single Star Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Absolutely. Be Coffee is a must-visit.

I ordered the EAT sandwich and hubs had the Chorizo scramble. The EAT scramble was huge, eggs were soft, well seasoned and fluffy. Avocado was creamy and fresh. English muffin toasted just right with a creamy mayo. The stars of the sandwich were the tomatoes and Munster cheese! I could of had those tomatoes as is with a touch of salt and the cheese was thick, smoky and just melted, couldn't miss the cheese! Chorizo scramble was fluffy, creamy and a big portion. Every bite had all the tastes. Banana peppers, creamy Munster, not salty chorizo, spinach and those to die for tomatoes. When you use fresh ingredients with the right amounts perfection is had!I had the cold brew and hubs had a hot coffee. Both on point. $24 including tip (order at counter) bring food over. The space is interesting, art gallery, work, industrial design. Glad we found this place and will be back again!",

As someone who has an extensive background in coffee, I have traveled to and visited many coffee shops around the world, and the coffee I was served today was superb.  They use different roasters from around the country, and whoever is choosing the beans, has great discretion. I have thoroughly enjoyed the Americano I have had today, so much, I have ordered three of them while I have been here!  The roast of the coffee I am enjoying is a medium roast with great notes.  I have not tried the food, though the smells wafting through the air have tempted me, but everyone seems to enjoy what they are eating and the food looks great.

And very patient and understanding when a patron asked to confirm that his drink had almond milk instead of regular milk. The cold brew was delicious both black and with a splash of cream. I ordered the whole grain toast with ricotta and strawberry-rhubarb jam. It was so good! You could tell the bread was toasted on the flat top because it had a fantastic crunch to it that you don't get with a toaster. I imagine their grilled cheese is excellent based on how tasty the toast was. We were able to get our food to-go, so I got to slather the ricotta and jam on myself. I could just eat that jam out of the little cup it came in. Very good and highly recommended.",

Neat ambience as you walk in, and ample parking, which is hard to come by on Roosevelt.  Very roomy and open atmosphere.  I had a pour-over and a ham, egg, and cheese breakfast English muffin.  The service was excellent.  My only complaint was that there were onions cooked into the eggs.  Had that been on the menu, I would have ordered my sandwich without it.  It was a bit of a surprise and I couldn't finish my sandwich.  Other than that, not bad.",

The baristas always remember my name (even though I've only been a few times) and the food/iced mochas are delish. There's a little plant shop inside, and for some reason that I haven't quite figured out, there's this adorable dog (maybe a boxer mix?) wandering around the shop all the time. I love that guests just let their dogs walk around without a leash -- it makes the place feel even cozier and friendlier than it already is.   Do yourself a favor and try the mocha, which is supposedly made with homemade chocolate ganache, and the Be Sammy. AMAZING.",

I was not disappointed.  I ordered the English turkey and munster egg Sammy and the Be Sammy and added the ham. Both were so amazing and is a lot of food. The English muffin is twice the size of a normal one with a slice of ham, munster cheese and I'd say 2 eggs (seasoned). The seasoning used on the eggs was good I think it was garlic, salt and pepper. The Be Sammy comes on an onion roll again huge. Only thing is 2 bucks for a thin slice of ham sends super steep, but like I said it was delicious.  I also got their large latte wroth skim milk and had then add caramel flavor which they make themselves in house, best latte I have had.  On another note they have some pastries on the counter for sale. I did not buy but the bear claw was about 3 times bigger than I have ever seen before and it looked good.  I will definitely recommend this place to others and if downtown again in the morning will hit it up again. I actually have already told 3 grieve about this place as a must try.",

The coffee shop is in a funky little spot and shares space with a cool plant shop--where I discovered air plants--and another restaurant that adjoins it (don't recall the name), plus a large space with a \"cyclorama\" wall. At first glance I thought it was some sort of skateboarding wall, but no--there's a helpful sign stating that it's used in photography and videography as an \"infinity\" background with no discernible beginning or end. But on to the food and coffee...  Loved the coffee with unlimited free refills--rich, with no bitterness. We got the chorizo egg scramble (delicious), toast with the most creamy ricotta ever and strawberry rhubarb jam (outstanding) and sourdough toast with house-made nutella, sliced bananas, and salt--absolute heaven!!",

A white gravy mixed with chorizo topped with an egg. I was a little suspicious about it but it was Delicious!  We ordered the all day burrito, the RoRo burger, and a ham/egg breakfast muffin. Where to begin. The breakfast burrito came with a salsa (super tasty). It had the right amount of everything inside to  let you savor all the flavors. The flour tortilla was toasted perfect. The RoRo burger was huge that will fill anyone up. The taste well, just go ahead and order it and you won't regret it. It came with fries that had Tajin, yes Tajin, that were incredible.  After speaking to Troy (Owner) he explained they only have one desert here. He was kind enough to bring us one. If you do not want to have anything to eat at least have this, a churro sandwich. It should be called SPECTACULAR/DELIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE. Troy, thank you and your staff for bringing this type of business to the area.",

Be Coffee + Food + Stuff is connected to an art exhibit, which you can walk around before or after your meal! My favorite item from here was the spicy cold brew - dark coffee brewed with (probably) some sort of chili and lightly sweetened. I had never tried this anywhere else, so I was super impressed at how advanced the food scene here at Phoenix is! We also had the breakfast burritos and scrambled, which were all fluffy and fresh & came in the perfect portion. The most memorable thing about this place is the space you get to enjoy your meal in! We ended up sitting all the way back in their yard area, which is covered by a tree that grows out of the middle of the yard. You get to sit directly underneath the tree, so you won't be hot and you get to enjoy your meal with a view!",

Normally, I think about it a week or so afterwards and then decide I better write a review. But this place is excellent.  I was served by Celine, and she was so friendly. Very inviting. She knew I hadn't been here before.  But She had the most friendly demeanor. So did her colleagues. Very impressed.  I had the egg Sammy, I think. Anyway it was this awesome English muffin sourdough. Grilled. Delicious crispy bacon. Avocado. A scrambled egg that's one of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. Evidentially, they put some kind of Mexican Crema in it. Well, whatever they do, it was dang good. They also put Munster cheese and a little bit of mayonnaise, not too much. It was just hot and delicious. The cappuccino was excellent, and a real cappuccino. Not A latte that pretends to be a cappuccino.  I'm an older dude, not a hipster. But this place was really cool. It's an art museum plus coffee shop plus small restaurant. I didn't take a picture of my food, because it was so good I dove into my egg Sammy before I thought about taking a picture. I didn't want to take one that looked half molested after taking numerous large bites.  I love places like this. Entrepreneur with skills that makes a really cool place. It's a kind of place you'd expect to find a New York City or some other large metropolitan area. It's really inviting for everyone, no matter whether young or old hipster not hipster, whatever-Ster. I'm gonna drive all the way from my 30 miles away, to take my daughters on a daddy daughter date here. They're going to dig this place. Can I use the word dig?  The only reason I'm giving four versus five stars, as I always do that on the first preview, so that when I come back, I make sure the place is consistent. But I'm sure it's five stars as much as four. Thank you for the delicious food.",

While you wait for your burrito you can peruse the art displays wishing you didn't spend so much on breakfast so could afford something to hang on your walls (avocado toast I blame you for all my financial woes).

I ordered the E.A.T sandwich and that were one of the best egg sandwiches i've ever had! It's a cute quaint little coffee shop connected to The Dressing Room; where the delicious food comes from! The next day I ended up there again. Got another vanilla latte and the breakfast burrito. Just as magically delicious! The bean salsa thing they give you with it, I practically licked the container. A MUST try in the Roosevelt area if you love good latte's and breakfast grub. Also, the staff was very welcoming and nice to help us on out on where to explore! Cool vibes.",

The kitchen, under the culinary magic of Pablo, whipped up a special avocado toast for me that was outstanding. I enjoyed a large cold brew spiced with cloves, cinnamon, and a hint of chile.   Someone else commented in their review that Be Coffee had the best breakfast sandwich in town, and my husband will vouch for that claim. He ordered the avocado egg sammy and savored every bite. What a cool space with tons of art, free Wi-Fi, great patio, and high-quality coffee.",

It wasn't busy when we got there but it was pretty early in the morning. My husband and I both got a breakfast sandwich which were huge! Definitely could have shared one but I'm not a huge portion person for breakfast. One of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had in a while! Their cold brew was good, my husband got a chamomile tea I believe which was also good. You can get things to go too if you need to be quick. There isn't outdoor seating that I saw. Parking is on the street but also around the back. We had no trouble getting a spot.",

I ordered a large White Chocolate latte, yum by the way, and the Be Sammy with ham. That has got to be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever eaten. It was huge, delicious, and satisfying. The ham was tender, yummy and not dried out. The roll was amazing. I wish I could buy a dozen of them and make sandwiches out of them every day. The bottom bun was like an everything bagel, so when you bit into your sandwich you got all that seasoning mixed in with your egg and cheese. Even after driving from their location to 16th st and Northern, my sandwich was still this amazing, can only imagine if I ate it there.  I will be hitting them up again, for sure.",

I ordered the Sammy for a breakfast sandwich, and it was an explosion for my taste buds. I definitely disagree with the review who said portion sizes were small, I thought everything was the perfect amount. Also, the apple fritter is probably the best apple fritter I've ever tried.

I've had two different coffee drinks, the second was a coffee and root beer drink that was interesting, but I think I would like to have it colder. The staff had been helpful each time. They have fresh baked cookies the size of your head.",

They know how good the salsa is, because they only give you one and charge extra for more.   They're located in Monorchid which makes it a unique spot for breakfast.

These people were bizarre from the get-go and looking for a handout. The cashier was extremely patient as the woman yelled about bugs in the case and turned around to point it out to the other 3 or 4 people standing in line while her child is listening. Then the kid starts telling people not to order food because there are bugs. Like I said... bizarre. We all looked at each other very confused and annoyed that she wouldn't just order...  I've been coming here for years, I've never so much as seen a fly in this place. They make everything from scratch and put a lot of love into their work. To have someone try to tarnish their reputation like this is sad. Hope the review gets removed and people see this place for its True colors.",

Their food is filling and delicious, and they have a mini museum inside the building so there is always something new//interesting to see.   To be specific: the breakfast sandwich is loaded with fluffy eggs and is super filling! I added a touch of sriracha and it was just what I needed to keep me going through the morning. Last time, I tried the Ricotta+Strawberry Rhubarb Jam toast. It was SO GOOD. The toast was thick and buttery -- plus lots of grains and seeds in there for good texture. Topped off with creamy ricotta and sweet jam, it hit the spot for my afternoon snack. Their cold brew was strong and tasty. (And all for a reasonable price!!)   Another bonus is that they allow dogs, so I'm able to study and snack with my pup. I'd definitely come back for more coffee+stuff, especially if I'm feeling hungry or want a peek around their art exhibits.",

If you're feeling fancy opt for a latte with a special flavor. The barista will guide you through flavors and what to expect. Since it's fall, I went for the pumpkin latte because, well, I'm basic. Every part of me LOVED this latte. It was the quintessential fall flavors that lunch through making this one of the best pumpkin lattes I've ever had.   Oh, yes the cookies.

I ordered a hot Nutella Latte and the roast was burnt and it didn't even taste like it had Nutella, maybe they didn't put enough? My friend ordered an iced Chai Tea Latte and she didn't like hers that much either.   On the other hand they did have a great peanut butter cookie with M&M's which was delicious and they had excellent customer service! But since they are marketed as a coffee house and that's their specialty they should improve upon that aspect. So great staff, and cookies, but sub-par coffee.",

I felt cool just sitting down and knocking out some work in this \"free WiFi\" setting !  2nd- as a burrito aficionado (SD/TJ class off 1996 ), the \"All- Day Burrito\" is up in my top 10 for sure! This super clean and unassuming burrito is packed w/all kinds of nuggets of awesomeness: Scrambled eggs (duh), applewood smoked bacon, avacado, pico. But the 2 ninja ingredients were the \"crispy hasbrown\" & toasted corn!   Lastly- what a super squad!! Super duper nice & welcoming, knew their sh*t, and didn't hesitate to get me extra salsa () when I asked for it. Definite hats off to Elise, Autumn & Korie . They were my Charlies Angle's of customer service today!  Thank you Be-Coffee squad, and their awesome leader Troy for stopping by and giving me the 411 (that means information for you youngbucks ) about this amazing venue and all the cool stuff they having coming.  Keep up the good work & I'll def be back!  Cheers!",

The English muffins are perfectly crisp on the outside and soft inside, and the ingredients are juicy and flavorful. The only thing I really was not crazy about was the chorizo scramble. It was a little on the small side, and felt like scrambled eggs with chunks of hot dog or sausage. Ever since, I've stuck to the sandwiches and have always been happy.",

It was within walking distance from my airBnB, so I was jazzed that I was going to have some place to snag some good coffee. Be is so much more than good coffee, they offer an awesome hang space, as well as some delicious food.  I walked in and was greeted by a very kind woman with an awesome hair cut. We chatted and I told her I was from out of town. She was very welcoming and her service was outstanding. Their spicy iced coffee was fantastic. It was slightly sweetened, but not enough to put off the taste. If I ever find my way back to Phoenix, I will definitely be paying another visit.",

There's probably a regular or two there with 300 dollars in tips a month. Definitely a hip vibe there, you'll feel cool for a second before you have to go back to Starbucks to consume their diarrhea in a cup.  5 out of 5 would crisis again.",

We were hungry, so he had the breakfast sandwich and I had the chorizo scramble.  Everything was so, so good. You can tell the food and drink are made with high-quality ingredients. Whoever does the food KNOWS how to cook scrambled eggs, and how to subtly use seasoning. The staff were friendly and gave us plenty of space. I love that the little succulent store is inside the building, for you to browse the plants after you're done eating. Bonus points for the adorable boxer hanging out inside!  Reasonable pricing for what you get. Initially we thought the portions were a little small, but we could barely finish our food-- which is what happens when you eat a quality, nutrient-dense meal!  I could definitely see myself returning to study or get some work done. The environment is quiet and relaxing, more so than most Starbucks locations nowadays.",

My wife had the Be Sammy sandwich, which was a large onion roll with a lot of egg and cheese. It was good, but we saw some other people getting english muffin sandwiches with turkey and avocado and other greens, which I think is the same price ($6?). So those might be healthier.  I kind of missed having a side of hash browns or potatoes, but I guess this was a healthier meal so that's good. The nutella ice coffee was good too, as was the iced jasmine tea. The tea was unsweetened and had a very strong herbal taste which I liked but some might not.",

First off, the staff is so super friendly - thanks to TJ and team for making us feel so welcome!  We both ordered the English Egg Sammy and it was like no other breakfast sandwich I have have eaten - super fresh english muffin (the best), eggs with herbs and onions, a thin slice of ham and muenster cheese...absolute perfection!  I enjoyed a nicely brewed lemon chamomile tea with my amazing sandwich and took a little extra to go with me.  We were also tempted by the amazing chocolate chip cookies that were begging us to buy one when we ordered.  Boy, am I glad we did - it was seriously one of the best cookies I have ever eaten.  I knew it would be good when the staff wouldn't let us leave until we each took a bite as they wanted to see our expression!  They were freshly baked that morning and it was so evident in their fresh, amazing taste.  I can't recommend this place enough...truly worth a visit!",

I fell in love with Be at the first mocha. I like their coffee (and atmosphere) even better - who wouldn't want to drink coffee while walking around an art gallery?  My office space is on Roosevelt Row, so I'm always there during the week. Now, I'm finding myself driving up there on the weekends as well. If you are anywhere near Downtown, you need to try this place out (allow a few extra minutes for parking).",

Seating is limited and not very conducive for small kids, even thought they had high chairs.   We got the iced coffee, one regular and one spicy. The regular was rather bitter. Spicy grew on me, made with two kinds of peppers. Kudos for creativity. We ended up mixing the two and enjoyed the combined coffees.",

    "text": "One of THE best (if not my absolute favorite now) coffee shops in town!!! I hate that I rarely ever get to downtown to check out the amazing places, but on the rare occasion I do, I always Yelp my way around... Which is how I found Be.   I'm always sold when reviewers say the coffee is amazing, so I just had to try it for myself. Found Be (altho I almost drove past it), parked and went inside, and was happily greeted by the baristas -- as if I was a long-time friend they hadn't seen in a while. After a quick pit-stop to the little girls room (which was a reason to wander around the venue, and let me just say AWESOME venue! They were actually setting up for a wedding; so cool!), TJ was so kind as to go over their menu, and explain the intoxicating, mouth-watering smell that was enveloping me and getting my tummy grumbling -- it was their breakfast sammies. With the way it smelled, I could not pass one up! I ordered for the English Egg Sammy with avocado, tomato, Muenster, and turkey. And of course, a latte -- I never pass on liquid gold! TJ explained that they make their own sauces in-house! What?! How awesome is that?! I, of course, opted for some caramel in my latte. (Great choice, btw, if you're wondering.)  As I was about to pay, the cookies hanging out by the register were taunting me... So I showed them better than to taunt me; I'll eat you if you taunt me, cookie! Yes, I got a cookie too -- a peanut butter M&M one. (These are all made in-house too. And made with love... Per the gentlemen working. Thanks guys!)   While waiting for my Sammy and coffee, I plopped myself down on the couch to relax for a bit. Most comfy couch EVERRR!!! And got to chat with a couple of girls sitting on the couch as well... Super nice ppl at Be!   Then the Sammy and coffee were ready and I sat at the table to eat. Oh Em Gee! The Sammy was incredibly tasty! And the coffee... Wow! Where do I even begin?! So bold and flavorful that with the first sip your tastebuds get lost in the rich creamy-ness of the deliciously perfectly roasted and brewed coffee. If you're reading this, go get some coffee at Be... You'll taste what I'm talking about!   As I was finishing my Sammy, I realized I hadn't gotten my cookie. I asked TJ where my cookie was and he apologized for not giving me one... And to make it up to me (not that he needed to), he let me pick out my cookie from the tray of freshly baked cookies. (Great customer service! Thanks, TJ!!!) I picked one that was thicker so it would be half-baked to perfection... And indeed it was cookie perfection!  As I left, I thanked TJ and the other guys working (sorry, I didn't get your names but you were all awesome!!!) for the awesome food, coffee, and exceptional service... and told them I'd be back soon, even though it means me driving 45mins one-way. Yes, it's THAT good!!!",

    "text": "LA girl flies to Phoenix with onion-hating boyfriend before making drive to Sedona  LA girl Yelps breakfast in Phoenix and is lead to the magic of BE COFFEE.  Iced coffee + almond milk: tasty level= standard   The magic of this place lies in 1) giant cookies staring at you while you order and more importantly 2)  giant breakfast sammy!   First bite was spectacular! Incredibly well seasoned eggs, ooey gooey melted muenster cheese, ripe avocado, tomatoes and thick slice of turkey. Onion-hating boyfriend LOVED the sandwich and only halfway through realized eggs are cooked with diced onions (A-hem*: this should be noted on menu though, guys, should said onion haters of the world have an actual allergy)   Anywho, I was sad to finish this Sammy -- very full but sad! I was so satisfied and satiated after tackling this sammy that I HAD to stop here again before my return flight to LA. Tried ordering it with ham...flavor profile wasn't the same. Either the eggs were under seasoned this second time around or the sliced turkey is the magic touch. Still great just not breathtaking!   Whichever herbs or s&p that were skillfully balanced on Sammy day 1 were not as present on Sammy day 2. :(   Whomever was working the line on Thursday 4/14 @ about 11am: YOU ROCK!   Overall cool space, good vibes and great brekkie options. If I ever find myself back in PHX, I'll surely stop here.",

Cool open space and energetic 90s esque hip hop accompanied by breakfast of the English egg Sammy (ham and egg on English muffin) and a caramel iced latte.   There sandwich is decently filling and tastes fresh without being overly salty. I got the latte on the barrister's recommendation for a sweet drink and that was good too. It seems that they do traditional coffees as well if you are into that.  Friendly service and good food makes this a place worth trying out.",

Let me start off by saying this place is a little different. Half museum, half kitchen, half coffee eatery. We told the lady at the counter we were new and she helped us out with the coffee. Having done some research my hubs ordered the egg sandwich and a lemonade. I got a mocha...and at the last second a warm pretzel.   Sat down after checking out the art on the walls. Coffee came out first. Simple and delicious. Then our food. The pretzel was a great last minute call, nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It seemed to have a light honey touch with nice big salt on the outside. Perfect sweet and salty. With a whole grain mustard. SO GOOD!!! And the egg sandwich....all the right flavors. Sometimes when you make it yourself, you think, how could I eff it up...and then it's not as good as you imagined...stop and go to Be. The egg sandwich is one of the best I've ever had. MUNSTER cheese...SOLD! Great job guys!",

Midday, the atmosphere was quiet with a few people sitting around working on laptops with good background music. The pour over I got was okay, the giant cookies in the pastry case were okay, the service was somewhat disinterested but okay, and the lack of coffee cup sleeves was not ideal, but okay. Perhaps this place is best visited when you can grab a bite to eat, but I found it to be just A-OK.",

Seriously, anything with avocado makes me drool. They have a good selection of coffees, i.e. Drip, pour over, latte, etc. It was cute and small, sat at the long table with other random people which was just fine cuz everyone was really friendly. You can even walk a few steps around the corner and check out the art gallery. I think it's part of first Fridays as well.   It's pretty hipster and you'll find a lot of different types of people here. Good food/sandwich and coffee was on point. I also loved that we didn't have to wait an hour in line to get seated like a lot of brunch spots on a Saturday morning. I only gave it a 4star cuz it didn't have the biggest selection but I could definitely see myself coming back to grab a quick bite to eat.",

At first, I was a little disappointed because their large is a 16 oz - my husband is a coffee addict, but he was cool with it. My hot almond milk vanilla latte was fabulous!   We also ordered the chorizo scramble and the Be Sammy sandwich. Like the coffee sizes, the portions were slim. However, both entrees filled us up! I enjoyed the Be Sammy sandwich - the bread was crunchy and packed with flavor! The music they were playing was my type of music too.   It was a chilly morning and I did not prepare well - I had a thin long sleeve shirt on so while eating, I just felt cold drafts in the building and it made me want to eat my food as quick as I could and leave.  Overall, we'd come back!",

I added Turkey because thats what the guy was eating when I came in, and I was very happy to.  This sandwich was MASSIVE and awesome.  The english muffin it came on I think was an MJ English Muffin, and I found out MJ was a lady who made them.

The relaxing and inviting couch along the windows has been replaced by three small utilitarian tables with hard stools, at which the Dressing Room serves food all day. There's also one other long \"communal\" table, also with hard stools for seating and popular with hipsters and their MacBooks, in the middle. The menu is very limited. The breakfast sandwich was just okay. The cookies are very good. The coffee has been good, though the \"double\" espresso shots seem a little weak.",

I fell in love with the vibe in bosque and the lady who helped me (I neglected to ask her name) was knowledgeable and could answer my random plant questions.   10/10 would definitely return again and give them my money.",

I understand everyone has off days but you never want to put that onto your customers who are most likely having a good day off enjoying breakfast. To wait forever for your food and then when it finally arrives to be greeted with \"sorry I'm having an off day because it's just one of those days - I know I dropped the ball on you guys\" - a better response would have been \"hey guys! Thanks for being so patient, I hope you enjoy - is there anything else I can get for you?\"   It's sad that poor customer service can ruin a place you once enjoyed.",

The coffee was very good also. The staff was polite and helpful and the food could not have been better. I tried my friend's chorizo scramble and it also was seasoned to perfection.

    "text": "The food here was probably some of the best food I've ever had.  As a drink, I had orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.  It tasted just like oranges.  For breakfast, I got the Ham + Muenster Sammy, which was delicious.  The muenster had contrasted the ham well.  I also had a bit of the Nutella and banana.  My mouth is watering just writing about it, as the Nutella was completely homemade and the best Nutella I've ever tasted.  The service was also wonderful, as it wasn't so busy while I was there, so one of the staff members had begun to talk to me, which was very pleasant.  If you want a delicious breakfast that doesn't cost too much money, come here, I highly recommend it. (Sorry about the commas, sometimes they enter before words like, which and, so.)",
