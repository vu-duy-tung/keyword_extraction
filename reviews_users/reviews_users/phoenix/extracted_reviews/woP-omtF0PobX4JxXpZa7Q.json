The main thing that would have improved the meal is the fries and burger could have used some more seasoning.

    "text": "So let me just say upfront that this place redefines kitch! I mean I would be shocked if you could find one square inch on a counter or wall that is not filled with some cutesy cup or sloppy slang. But I adore this place. It's small and there is almost always a bit of a wait, but the staff hustles and they are incredibly friendly.   The menu is surprisingly large and creative for a family run, diner style breakfast and lunch place. They offer the obvious choices you would expect of this fare, but then they toss in a little something to juice it up. They have a standing Steak and Eggs special for $5.95 that I have never sampled but I've seen one hell of a lot of them move through that kitchen! They also have a fairly decent all you can eat Fish deal from 11:00 to close. My personal favorites would have to be either... wait for it... \"The Julie Plate\" (yes it is actually called that) or the Breakfast Burrito (which bulges with ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, chiles, and country potatoes). But try one of their daily specials, like German Pancakes, and you may be hard pressed to go back to the regular menu. One word of caution is that the servings here are HUGE. I can literally make three meals out of the BB and still have a bite or two to share with my dogs.   Ronnie's opens at 6:00 or 6:30 a.m. (don't know which, because I'm not awake at that time of day) and closes at 2:00 p.m. It is not pretentious. It is the kind of place that is comfortable, clean, and serves a steady stream of loyal customers which are greeted by name along with hugs and smiles. Prices are reasonable if you consider the amount of food you receive, and the consistent quality / selection far exceeds that of the most popular chains. If you are looking for trend, go somewhere else... it will just make my table free up a little sooner. ; )",

During the time of my employment I was harassed and bullied by Tara and Nikki (two servers there) I went to my bosses (the owners, Wendi and Richard) several times for help. I told them I felt bullied,  I also said I was in a hostile work environment. The response from both was \"if you don't stop complaining, your hours will be cut.\" I as well as other staff have witnessed these same two girls bully other staff member on many occasions. Because the owners are \"friends\" with these girls, I was fired for asking for help in a volatile and hostile environment. After being fired, the harassment has not stopped. These girls along with the owner Wendi have been trying to cost me my new job by making False complaints. I have taken legal action regarding this situation. if you have witnessed any indiscretions regarding these employees, please feel free to call me at 602-578-5637. My lawyer and myself will be happy to speak to you. My name is Jessica",

Not only are their serving big enough for 2 or three but the actually taste is amazing.  I usually get the skillet.  Center-cut bacon, ham, cheese and red potatoes.  My Mom gets the Feta spinach omelet and I've had the French toast.  The service is wonderful and you'll never have an empty cup of coffee.  This is our \"go-to\" breakfast place.",

    "text": "From the front door Ronnie's Cafe looks like any other mom and pops restaurant. But the sign of $5.99 steak and eggs gravitates me in like a small comet to the planet Jupiter. I enter the establishment and step back to a simpler time in grandma's country farm house. I do not need to worry, as grandpa seems to have placed enough sports and patriotic decor in this place to keep it masculine enough to anchor me safely inside. The waitress approaches in the classic inviting yet \"lets get the show on the road\" kind of fashion.  I place my order and begin to nurse on my beverage. Suddenly my eyes drift to some of the art on the walls. Upon a closer inspection I discover a small sticker in the corner of the piece, it's a price tag! I quickly realize that all the pieces in the restaurant are for sale and I am dinning in the middle of grandma and grandpa's yard sale. I decide to add the \"Worlds Greatest Dad\" coffee mug to my order. Sure this act was self serving, but hey I'm treating myself to breakfast, I may as well get a souvenir.     The waitress reports back promptly with my food and I stare in dismay at the immense size of the pancake that has mysteriously made the entire plate disappear, under its shear mass. Unsure where I should begin the assault on this monster, I feel it better to sink my teeth into the sausage link instead. The snap was incredible and the mildness of the seasoning was pleasant and not too strong as many breakfast sausages usually are. Despite the mildness of the seasoning there was still a tremendous amount of pork flavor radiating from the link. I try a bite of my home fries. They were buttery and full of herbs and with a dash of the gunslinger sauce they were amazing. Now that my pallet was laden with salt it was time to go after the pan cake. I begin my battle against the light but massive pile of doughy goodness and the syrup and butter highlight the cooked to perfection cake. Coffee, more delicious potatoes and sausage keep me on track to find myself full beyond measure at about one third into the meal. Left overs are going home but skip the doggie bag. My dog gets none of this, it's my lunch.     I will be back again for sure, to enjoy this breakfast fare that can only be described as a dinning experience. I will recommend the restaurant to my friends and family. But as God is my witness I will defeat a pile of their pancakes before I die!",

The menu has everything breakfast, from fruit to cottage cheese to chicken fried steak with eggs over medium. Which is what I got. Erik got biscuits, ham and gravy.   Everything was perfect. Except be prepared for portion size bc for me, it was too much. This diner truly is a breakfast place worth trying if you're not from this are (which I'm not).",

Pass on this one unless you like feeling like you're in the Goonies movie.  \"hey you guys!!!\"",

The place was very busy and the waitresses scurried around taking care of everyone the best they could, being shorthanded.  Ours was friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, my husband's biscuits and gravy we're mediocre, at best, with no discernable sausage or other meat in the white gravy, which also lacked any seasoning.  The biscuit was OK.  He also had a banana muffin, a large, molten hot Costco type commercially prepared muffin served with a fluffy butter substitute. I had the cinnamon french toast, which did look tasty... cinnamon swirl in a Texas toast style bread.  Unfortunately, it was just puffy and tasteless....we couldn't taste any cinnamon, no eggy batter taste, nothing.  They serve it with the fluffy \"butter\" stuff, and a cold bottle of \"not maple\" syrup. The coffee was pretty tasteless, too and served with cream substitute.  They are packed with customers, regulars, who love the place, but we were sorely disappointed.",

We said no, then she walked away.    So the older lady just looked at us and I was confused, I thought maybe we are to seat ourselves.   A different waitress said how many we said 2 and she walked away.  A different gal came and said 2 and looked so confused to where to seat us, she took us to a table but held our menus looking towards back of resturant to seat us there but then put down our menus.  Then our waitress walked by and said I'll be right with you. Came back for our drink order.  I ordered the Cinnamon French Toast I didn't taste any Cinnamon it was a lot of egg and their syrup is in a Dirty Root Beer Bottle and is hard to come out.  My hubby got the Chili Omelet with the Home Fried Potatoes which where very undercooked, some where still half raw.  Our waitress never came back to our table she dropped off our food with the check.  I wanted a fill up on my coffee our waitress was no where to be seen, so we flagged down a different waitress.  Our plates where sitting there forever and we noticed other tables weren't picked up either.  The bathroom always had a line, I tried to go but it was locked and smelled from the outside so I didn't even bother.  The manager looked so tired and worn down like she didn't want to be there.  The Hostess looked bored and mad the whole time,  she never smiled.  It looks a bit dirty.  It takes forever to pay your bill. On your bill they don't even add the total,  so the old lady has to figure it out in her head so that takes a while and when I went to pay our bill the machine ran out of paper.  Very outdated  Won't be going back  Needs New Manager, New Hostess and New Cashier",

However, the prices were very reasonable and the portions were very large, so you will absolutely get your money's worth. This type of food is not for those looking to be healthy, and coming here may remind of the obesity epidemic America faces. Other than that, the place really doesn't stand out in any way. There are some nice decorations hung up about the store you can purchase, but that's about the only unique feature. In every sense, mediocre is the word that I'd use to sum this place up.",

My wife had seen this place the other day as we drove past so yesterday when we were discussing whether to make breakfast at home or go out, I decided to come to Ronnie's.  Upon arrival the parking lot was packed. I expected a long wait. However, we were seated in about 10 minutes.  We immediately noticed the knick knacks on the walls. It gave me a \"grandma's house\" feeling. It was very pleasant.   Our waitress was very polite and attentive. Couldn't have asked for better.   My 5 year old ordered a pancake breakfast off of the kids/senior menu. The plate consisted of a pancake bigger than I could eat if I tried, eggs, and a big sausage. She loved it!  My wife had an omelet. I don't know what it was but it looked AMAZING!  I ordered a skillet with eggs, potatoes, chorizo, jalapenos, and tons of cheese. I tried as hard as I could to finish it but I only managed to down half. Flavor is spot on. In fact, it is my lunch today.  This place is an absolute must visit!",

Then the Army sent us to GA for two years. All we did was talk about Ronnie's. And the day we got back to Phoenix, we went to Ronnie's and it was like we never left. The portions are huge (my wife and I always split the Paula and Jim's Skillet). My son, who's 15 and a big eater, has yet to be able to finish a whole pancake. But honestly, the best part about this place is the people. All the wait staff are great, the owner is a sweetheart who acknowledges every customer when they come in and again when they leave and the kitchen guys are geniuses. These guys put out all this food in a kitchen the size of a small walk in closet. Overall, the best breakfast in Phoenix.",

And to our server lisa I know you didn't cook the food I get that but arguing with a customer is poor customer service. But by the looks of the other reviews this place isnt known for their customer service. It's waitress and places like this that give us good waitress's bad names.

I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, with homemade bread (good choice) and country style hash brown baby red potatoes.     This I will say, the country style has brown potatoes were the best I have every had, super crisp on the outside, done right on the inside with herb and spices.",

    "text": "Stopped in here Saturday  morning after some friends suggested it and, of course, I had Yelped it.  Julie wasn't sure when they opened (6AM) so I got there about 6:45 and the place was already about 1/3 full.  The waitress, who appeared to be old enough to be my mother, made sure I knew about the senior menu on the back cover.  The service was pretty good.  They initially forgot me as I had been seated in the front corner but after that I was checked on on a regular basis.  I am pretty sure all 3 of the waitresses were seniors and they put a lot of younger servers to shame as they bustled around taking care of their and each others customers.  Definite teamwork in play.  Many of the customers appeared to be regulars as they chatted with the waitresses and folks at other tables.  I may have ordered the wrong thing.  I had the Sh-- on a shingle with 2 eggs on the side and a large glass of orange juice.  It consisted of their standard white gravy with some shreds of corned beef on top.  The basic gravy had a pepper taste which I have had before in diners but I would have assumed the dish would be made with chipped beef.  Probably not ordered consistently enough to make it worth while.  Even after eating my eggs the gravy was scalding hot and I was surprised it had not separated or filmed over, which would have been my luck doing it at home.  Total bill w/tax $9.51, and I was full.  Overall the place had a good vibe to it.  It opens early enough I want to stop in and try some of the breakfast specials that are only available on weekdays.",

I went online to find the best breakfast places in Peoria and this place was at the top of the list.  Seemed very family-oriented in two ways: family friendly, yet locals seemed to be treated like family.  I felt very comfortable being here amongst the locals.  And a great thing happened while here. I was sitting next to some folks that were telling the waitress, whom they were aquainted with, about how they were interested in selling their 4 tickets to the Cards football game the next day. I asked them a few questions about the tickets. By the time I left the restaurant, I had two tickets and a parking pass for a better price than I could have ever gotten at the game. Thank you, whoever you are!!  Place was packed on this Saturday morning.  Great homey decor.  Service was excellent and everyone was friendly.   If you live in the area, you probably have been here.  If you haven't, you should go.",

When our food came out my food was cold, my wife's chicken fried steak was under cooked the batter around it was still raw. My son and Daughters eggs were supposed to scrabble with cheese but they forgot the chesse. They did remake my our meals but never got an apology or any compensation. Been nice to have the management come over and apologize. Not sure if I will go back.",

I agree with Devin J.  \"It may look like it was over-decorated by the kitschiest of grandmothers...\" but it had a cozy charm to it. And it seemed most of the decore was for sale! The food may not be the healthiest but it was still really good and the servings are gynormous. The staff and even the patrons were all very friendly. Our waitress even gave my niece a hug and kiss on the cheek when she told her it was her 4th birthday. I had the Adam which is biscuits topped with carved ham and gravy and served with potatoes. SO SO SO GOOD! My dad had the chili omelet and was not happy with it. It was bland, no chili taste to it. It looked more like canned refried beans on it instead of chili, but of the four of us, he was the only one not happy with his food.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time last Sunday after mass (also the weekend of superbowl) and it was absolutely amazing.   There was already a wait at 940am but glad we decided to wait based on all the awesome reviews.  We actually didnt wait that long maybe about 10 mins if that.  Best part was they were selling girl scout cookies right outside! Haha anyway the restaurant decor is full of colorful things hanging on the walls.  Little did we know most of the items on the walls are for sale!  If you look closely you will see a small price tag on the item somewhere.  Now the food.. is amazing!   The portions are definitely huge, no matter what you order its literally going to fill the entire plate! Saw someone eating the paula and jim's omlette special and ordered that with potatoes and wheat toast.  The boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs for only 6.99.  The omlette was definitely everything and the kitchen sink, filled with bacon, sausage, ham and some other herbs and seasoning all smothered in melty cheesey goodness! Came on a skillet and kept it hot the entire time I was devouring the meal! Loved that the waitress offered salsa with it and their salsa is pretty good with a very nice kick of jalapenos.   Anyway... what I loved most was that their toast had a generous amount of butter that melted nicely on the toast.  Most places are very stingey with their butter as if butter was costly!  But this place gave me enough where I was happy :).  Anyway the steak and eggs are definitely worth it.  Its a good size sirloin steak,  might be about 8 to 10oz maybe.  It was cooked a little more than med rare but thats okay since its not a steak house the slight overcooking is okay,  therefore you may wanna do one level undercooked to expect it to be slightly over cooked when you get the steak.  But the food was soo good it was still good the day after for lunch at work!!  Will definitely come back again!",

Although I don't really like the plates and cups and silly sayings on the walls and counters and everywhere else they could fit it I love the food and staff. Everyone where some teams jersey, I'm not a fan but whatever. I'm there for the food and friendly service. It's True that they are almost always busy, requiring a wait. I don't care. It's usually not long and it's worth it.  My fav on the extensive menu is Adam's Eggs. An extra large biscuit, poached eggs, ham and cream gravy. Oh yes, and a huge portion of home fries. Delicious!!! The plate sized pancakes are great and Farmer John Breakfast or something like that is a meal for 3 people. That is not an exaggeration.   All things considered they have my vote for best breakfast. Maybe I should make the trek down to Matt's but their wait is just not attractive to me. I hear the food is awesome, but in neighborhood Ronnies is king.",

My wife ordered a Pepsi and it was tasteless.  She exchanged for an iced tea that is weak. We ordered soup before the meal and it hasn't shown up in the last 10 minutes. Service is weak at best. Just before the meal showed up the waitress said they were out of chicken noodle soup....at the beginning of lunch?  The food came piping hot but the breakfast burrito has no flavor whatsoever.  My wife has had to put salt on it 3 times. The Greek omelet was flavorful and big. The side of fruit was disappointing as was the barely warm frozen buscuit.  Since we came from the east side to come here we are not impressed with this visit.",

There were plenty of waitresses and after a 1\\2 hour of not even getting coffee we had enough. Dont have a clue why we were snubbed, but to add insult to injury, two of the employees had to make sarcastic remarks like \"Have a nice day!\" on our way out. Don't understand, and don't really care cause we are never going back.  If you are looking for an awesome breakfast I highly recommend \" Crazy Otto's \" just up the street. Your not missing anything special at Ronnies. Cept bad customer service. :P",

When I saw the pictures on Yelp with the homey decor and plates piled high with scrumptious looking breakfast staples, I knew we'd found a winner. I was surprised there was no wait on a Sunday morning. We were seated and drink orders taken right away. We all enjoyed our breakfast thoroughly. Portions were huge and prices very affordable. We ordered the kids french toast for my son and the kitchen accidentally made the adult portion. Our waitress noticed right away and only charged us the kid's price. For about $30 we had breakfast for three adults and one child, with leftovers to boot. And before I forget: the breakfast potatoes were AMAZEBALLS! I consider myself a connoisseur of breakfast potatoes and these were seriously the best I've ever had. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned perfectly. Awesome!",

We were seated right away and our server was very nice and patient as we poured over their extensive menu.  And now comes the reason for the 2 stars. Although the server was good, the kitchen was not. I ordered egg whites and got regular scrambled eggs. My son ordered a make your own omelet and they messed it up. What was interesting is that our server noticed the food was wrong while she was serving it to us and still attempted to give it to us anyway while arguing with herself that it was wrong. We turned the food back and she went back to the kitchen and reemed the kitchen staff a new @-hole. Literally. We were sitting by the kitchen and heard her yelling at them...and apparently this wasn't their first screw up of that morning.  We saw the ticket and she had clearly written it up right so this was all the kitchen's fault. At this point, our food came out in pieces. My son got his omelet but not his sides. I got my toast on one plate, bacon on another, and egg whites came out about 15 minutes after everyone else's food. Further, the \"fruit cup\" is basically canned fruit cocktail with a couple of cantaloup cut into it. Not cool. It was basically a big cluster----. Our server apologized profusely and frequently.   Now, in knowing that our experience was not what it should have been, our server could have given us a discount or taken a meal off or something, but nothing was offered and there didn't appear to be a manager around. I looked. Which leads me to wonder if she wasn't a manager given the way she reemed out the kitchen staff, now that I think about it.   I'll consider trying them again because it can't be that bad twice. The food, once we got it, was tasty. We will definitely need to share in the future because the portions are obscenely large. I hope next visit is better than this one.",

    "text": "Wanted to give them another try.  We live in the neighborhood and after about a year we wanted to see if the kitchen had gotten any better.  My boyfriend got an omelette and I got eggs and turkey patties.   His omelette was brown on the outside because it was cooked for so long, the eggs had a crunch.  His home fries were also way overcooked.  My sausage patties were so well done that I had to struggle to cut them and they were so rubbery that they could not be eaten.  my eggs were cooked over medium as I asked but by then I did not want to eat just an egg.  Our server was nice, but once the food and the check were dropped she did not come back to find out why we had barely touched our food. Upon checking out we had another server ring us up.  We explained to her that the food was overcooked.  She said she was sorry.  After paying $30 for a meal and telling her 'thanks for a bad meal' she turned around and said so we could hear her \"not my fault I didn't cook it.\"  Yes she did not cook it but she is the next reason why we will not be back in.  We did not yell, cuss, scream or act rudely to her.  We were disappointed and we were expressing that.  We did not deserve to be talked back to rudely, I am not paying to hear her opinion about my dining experience.  I returned in to speak to a manager.  I guess there is rarely a manager in there and I would have to keep calling until I got him.   It is a local mom and pop restaurant, I am not asking for 5 star service but I would like a little respect, a decent meal when I pay for it.  If anything it is a disappointment, it is a restaurant I would like to support because it is not a big chain.",

My family and I went here and their food is fantastic, the servers are really friendly and the owner himself goes out to talk to the customers and ask how's the food.  I highly recommend this place for family weekend breakfast!",

I feel like the cooks are inconsistent and while I like their French Toast, some days it's just not as good. Maybe the bottom is overcooked, maybe it's not cooked enough. It just seems like recently I haven't gotten the same French Toast as I used to get when I first started going years ago, which is disappointing. I stop by when I'm really wanting a quick hot breakfast but I think there are a lot better breakfast places that I would rather have even with the longer drive.",

Service was prompt and friendly. This restaurant is a heavy locals spot. Many customers were greeted by name and even received hugs from the staff.  Their menu offers a lot of interesting choices. My wife got the cinnamon french toast with eggs (scrambled) and bacon which she enjoyed very much.  I ordered the chicken fried steak (really good) with scrambled eggs, grits and biscuit.  My only disappointment was with the grits. They were runny and had a soupy consistency (was not the case on my first visit). Our waitress was excellent and made several visits for drink refills and to check on us. The little hiccup with the grits won't stop us from returning again.",

So was the service.  It would appear that on the 17th of January, 2016 the restaurant was just experiencing a small hick-up.   We collectively had a pancake, eggs /w sausage.  Belgian waffle covered with whipped cream and lots of strawberries, a short stack with lots of cream and strawberries, chicken fingers with honey mustard and french fries, and a tuna melt sandwich.  Everyone was very pleased with their order.   I'm putting Ronnie's back on my \"go to\" list.",

    "text": "Been here: 20-30 times  Ronnie's is pretty good (there's a reason I keep coming back) but should come with a few words of caution for non-regulars and newcomers (why I give it a 3).   What's good: the food is consistently OK to good (75% of the time), the wait staff (on the floor) is quite friendly, and the prices and portion sizes are hard to beat.    What you may, or may not, like: the food is quite greasy- I actually enjoy that, but know some people have a hard time with (or are turned off by) greasy foods.  What you need to be warned about: I have had a few experiences of less than exceptional customer service at the front of the restaurant.  In specific, I had a particularly unpleasant experience with a staff member at the cash register.  Unfortunately, from reading other reviews, I don't think that is as uncommon as I'd hope it to be.  What to know: Although they don't have a sign, do wait to be seated at the front. You will also pay up front when you're done.   In short: This is a local, mom n' pop cafe with some of the quirks that come with that.  Food is pretty consistent and service is usually good.  Wouldn't recommend going out of your way for it, but would mention it to a local interested in giving it a try.  I would not bring guests here due to the lack of consistency in food quality and service (I made that mistake).  If you do have guests, I would recommend checking out Black Bear diner, which is a safer option with much of the same local charm.",

The ribeye was cooked nicely but it didn't have much flavor. We added some salt and pepper which made it taste a ton better. Their pancake was on point; fluffy and soft. Note: the pancake is huge so refrain from ordering more than one unless it is your whole meal! Enjoy!",

    "text": "First walk in: flags. A lot of tchochkes and neon nonsense on the walls. Tons of people of all types. It's Americana, distilled and directed into a river of breakfast foods. Ronnie's appears, at first glance, a dumb and earnest exercise in monetizing every aspect of the dining experience. The walls are essentially all advertisements, toys and models and mobiles hang hang on string (also for sale), and even the tabletops themselves are covered in ads for local businesses. I'm certain, if it were viable, that the napkins and silverware would also be sold or advertised on.   The menu is further covered in flags, and has a confusing \"9/11 special\" advertised to state that they're going to memorialize the September 11th terrorist attacks with free breakfasts, and this advertisement is permanently affixed *regardless of what time of year it is*. Ronnie's is trying to make something abundantly clear to each and every person that walks in the door: they love their country very much, and it's very important that you know that. Anyone that is uncomfortable by unbridled displays of patriotism need not apply.  Ordering at Ronnie's: the portion sizes are insane. The pancakes are about the size of dinner plates, but they're thicker. Two of them alone, absent any other breakfast items, could make a large man nap. I say this from experience. Almost anything you are going to order is going to be a little larger than you think it is, and you're most likely going to leave Ronnie's groggy, glassy-eyed, sloshing slightly from coffee and syrup. I have attempted, on multiple occasions, to finish a Big Farmer's Breakfast. I have failed by a sizable margin every time. It was always a two person job, truly, and it was hubris to think I could best it.  So: why 5 stars? The staff. Everyone at Ronnie's hustles. Both the house and the kitchen are good at their jobs, they want you to have a good time, and they're fast. Even when the dining room is packed out the door, which is frequent (the after-church rush can be especially brutal), they are remarkable at turning over tables, getting entrees and drinks out, and maintaining a high standard of service/quality despite moving so rapidly. You can tell when a server is experienced and comfortable, and the people here are naturals. Tip them well, because that kind of enthusiasm and talent can be hard to find.",

I believe the only reason this place is rated as well as it is on Yelp is due to it not having much competition in the area.",

Ronnie's came up as #1, so I dragged the family 15 minutes outta our way for crap!  The restaurant staff were nice, but unfortunately that doesn't make the food taste better .  My daughter sent back her eggs because they were brown.  The waitress didn't understand what was wrong with them.  My daughter said she wanted them yellow and fluffy.  When her plate was returned, they looked wet and brown.  I gave her permission not to eat them.  The sourdough toast was burnt hard and cold, like it was sitting out for a while.  The bacon was a dirty oil brown color, but looked soggy.  My kids love bacon, but they couldn't eat the two strips they got.  I got the 2 egg Bfast, which came with oatmeal.  I only ate the oatmeal, which was very good.  Everything was just bad overall.  Over half the food was left untouched on our plates.  I don't know all these yelpers who gave them great reviews, but I'm telling you don't waste your money.",

Their pancakes are literally the size of a plate, so you probably only need one. Homemade chicken fried steak is incredible. Reuben sandwich is perfect.

The huge portions, the good food and the great service really made this event super--and the reasonable price for the food just topped it all off.  More than one person said to come back here when we meet again...and we will! We stayed for 2 hours, loved everything here and will definitely do a repeat in the near future!  Ronnie's Cafe is an excellent breakfast place for us! Our waitress handled the 10 of us with no problem it seemed, and her service was so appreciated.  She was quick, efficient and friendly.  No complaints here. Lots of parking out front and homey atmosphere--almost MIdwestern in it's way--which is  missing in so many places in Phoenix which seems to go for the modern, sterile look that is boring and uninteresting.  We loved the kitchy stuff for sale on their walls, frankly....crazy and we loved it.  We spent part of our time just reading the signs they have up for sale.

He had Sh** on a Shingles and I had the 2 pancake breakfast, the food taste homemade and the portions where huge. We order the Farmers Breakfast to go at least 3 times a month, its enough food to feed 2. We have also ordered lunch at Ronnie's and have had no complaints. The onion rings are very good.",

Didn't get the servers name..she never told us. Blonde hair purple shirt.  After waiting more than 30 mins for corned beef hash and a Greek omelette and noticing tables seated after us are getting their steaks served before our omelette, we inquired and were told omelettes take much longer to prepare and make.  After another 15 mins our food comes.  I've had 2 cups of coffee and am jittery by now.  The dry rye toast I ordered was buttered.  When we mentioned it she said \" I don't have dry on my ticket\". Okay I'm a liar I didn't order it dry.  She knows at this point we've asked to talk to the owner and says this to us \" the owner will be out to talk to you.  He made the omelette.  You can tell him he is stupid.\". WTF!?  WAS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?   So going fwd I like Ronnie's too much to stop eating there.  But if I walk in next time and she is serving I will walk right back out.",

I had a steak that was tough but raw inside, I wanted to send it back but it was already to tough to chew, any longer on the flame wouldn't help.  Another ordered fish and it was so covered in oil that it was inedible.  The service was good and everyone working there was very friendly but even good service cant distract from the appearance.  This place is just so filthy.  Tchotchke's fill every nook and cranny and they appear to have never been dusted.  Wall to wall carpet that is stained so it adds to the unclean appearance.  It just felt gross inside.",

    "text": "This place is delicious.  Now, when I say delicious, I mean slap-yo-mama-do-a-dance-and-feel-the-magic-on-your-tastebuds good!! The man and I went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning around 10:30ish.  I wasn't sure if the after church crowd would have taken the place over by then, but we were willing to risk it.  We love little local dives and based on the reviews, we figured this was right up our alley. When we arrived, we were told that it would be about 15 minutes.  We waited on a couple of chairs outside and were called in less than five.  I had originally gone in with the intention of getting the egg croissant sandwich (a picture was posted), but then EVERYTHING looked good, so I wanted to try a little of everything. I got the \"Julie's Everyday Breakfast\" (or something like that... basically bacon and eggs) with the home fries and biscuits and gravy.  The man got the breakfast skillet with chorizo and we got a pancake (yes, just one) to share.  The coffee was refilled twice before our order got there.  Not because it took a long time, but because they're THAT on top of it.  Everything was fan-freaking-TASTIC.  We like to think of ourselves as connoisseurs of bacon and this was some of the best!  It was thick cut and crispy without being burnt.  The eggs were light and fluffy, the home fries were nicely cooked (but needed a touch of salt.)  The man's skillet was REALLY flavorful and had a kick without being TOO spicy (well, it was spicy for me, but i'm a honkey white girl... he added salsa and hot sauce to it...) He went with the server's suggestion to get tortillas on the side to make a couple of little breakfast burritos... which he did and he still had HALF of his breakfast left!! And the pancake was everything a pancake should be.  It was spongey but not soggy, sweet but not sugary and the sides spilled over the edge of the plate.  Yum!! The decor was that of a typical local diner.  The chairs were on casters which was nice; there were pictures and decorations covering the walls that were for sale and the plates were the usual beige color.  Sure, the carpet could use some updating and the plastic table cloths remind me of my grandma's house.  But overall, it was great and we will definitely be back and we'll be bringing our friends and their appetites!",

The fried potatoes were awesome, nice and crispy with a soft center.   Scrambled eggs were good as well.   My girlfriend got the strawberry pancakes, and it looked like a pizza when they brought it out.   The pancakes were huge, and worth it for only costing $6.   Service was good, waitress was on top of our order and we got our food very fast.   For less than $17, we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast on a saturday morning, and got right in without a wait.   Overall experience was great, and would recommend Ronnie's Cafe to anyone, especially people who like large portions.   Will be going back very soon!",

I am one of the originals who came to this place from the very beginning.  I was a steady customer for a long time.  People there knew my name, what I liked to drink, eat, etc etc.  This all changed one day while I was in there having breakfast close to where the cash register is.  I overheard the waitresses talking down about a regular customer who I have seen in there quite often.  What they were saying was inappropriate and should not have been said about the guy.  After witnessing that I find myself going there less and less.  Too many other breakfast places out there to have to listen to employees talking down about the customers.",

The flavor was pretty bland...nothing exciting. The BF got biscuits and gravy and a pancake and thought they were really good. I thought they were also pretty meh.

I got the croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and I substituted sausage patties for the ham. Hubby got the chicken fried steak with potatoes, eggs with cheese and toast. Our son got two pancakes. There wasn't anything wrong with our food...it was just kind of meh. Neither me nor my husband finished our food (and he loves chicken fried steak). Neither one of us were impressed with the eggs. My son loved his pancakes though! They were HUGE, they literally took up an entire dinner plate. He said they were delicious and he took the remainder to go.   The place is clean, the servers friendly and the food is reasonably priced. Decor is really cool and almost everything on the walls is for sale which is an interesting idea.   All that considered we won't be back. We were really underwhelmed with our food and there are too many really exceptional places to eat for the same cost.",

If you want a small town, country feel in a diner, this place is it. Since it's a non-chain, family owned place, it has its own feel and I love that. They are only open for breakfast and lunch and well worth the visit(s).",

They were busy but I was seated right away. My server was Sam who was attentive and personable, making sure I had anything I needed. I got an omelette from the senior menu that came with their home fries. Oh so good! Not a single complaint. The portions are HUGE. I have leftovers for later. The coffee was good and I was overall very pleased with my breakfast. Highly recommend this diner.",

I left saying \"wish we had a Ronnie's in our neighborhood!\"   Very friendly service , great menu options, generous portions and yummy food.   I had a couple bites of my daughter's  French toast and it was AMAZING. I'm watching my carbs and ordered an omelette. It was delicious and cooked well. I had a nibble of biscuit that was served with it. It was very soft and rich, just how a biscuit should be! My only disappointment was with the potatoes. They're the sole reason for dropping a star. I wish I could do a 4.5. There wasn't any seasoning at all and they were very bland. It helped me stick to just a couple bites, though.   Coffee was refilled often and the kids got cups with lids. Smart staff!   Thank you for a wonderful family breakfast.  We'll definitely go again when we're back in town.",

I had the country fried steak and white  gravy platter, and my significant other had the western omelet, which I had a taste of.  The portions are great and as to the omelet and country fried steak, they were very great tasting, too.  The home fries are the best.  Between the two of us, we had 2 large breakfasts for under $20.   Go hungry, because you will have leftovers.  The people next to us ordered pancakes, and they were the size of the entire plate.    The waitress was very attentive and very polite, the food was delivered fast (I would say within 15 minutes after we ordered it, or less)and we were seated right away, even though it was very busy.

I am though, a fan of breakfast being done right.  Generous servings, great tasting food, and a very at-home style atmosphere.  The only thing I'm against the all the random items on the wall with prices.  It makes it feel a little too much like a flea market.    If it didn't have price tags, it would feel more like charm instead of someone trying to make a quick buck.",

When I looked it up in yelp, Ronnie's looked good and it was less than 10 miles away.    Staff was friendly & helpful.  There was about a 10min wait,  but not bad for a Sunday.     Food was AMAZING!   I ordered the Cadd Special (2 pancakes,  2 eggs & 2 strips of bacon).  But silly me, I couldn't resist the Biscuits & Gravy so I ordered a 1/2 order.  I was also dying to try the home fries but decided my eyes were probably larger than my stomach (thank goodness I did not order more food).  The pancakes were so LARGE they filled a whole plate on their own.  Seriously,  I only ate half of one & I was stuffed!  The half order of biscuits & gravy was the perfect side & they were also Fabulous!   Next time my family us in town,  we will be visiting Ronnies.",

I looked up a mom-and-pop store found this place, the pictures that I have attached are all three of our meals and I must say for the value you get Quality; so it's definitely worth the value.   The environment is totally a mom and pop hotspot you walk in and you feel like you're in cheers, everybody knows your name the servers are phenomenal they recognize you they remember you, everything on the wall you can buy and there's so much variety. They always have coffee decaf or regular they have like 6 or 7 pots of them all over the place ready to go at no given time and they're constantly asking how things are going for you how things are good anything else for you. It is definitely worth your value, your time and your gas to drive if you're far away!!  I will continue to return many times!",

While they don't give it away,  the prices are reasonable.   The under 12 menu is also the over 55 menu,  which we rarely see.  Today we had corned beef hash,  which almost always our choice when made from scratch.   This was,  and it was outstanding.

I've been to this restaurant probably 30+ times, and it's just as great every single time. Breakfast or lunch, this place is amazing for both.   FOOD: My favorite dish to order here is Karen's Famous Tuna Melt. This sandwich is so amazing every time. I do wish that the tuna had more flavor, but the bread is toasted with parmesan. They offer french fries or home fries with this meal. I would highly recommend the home fries instead. Their breakfast portions are HUGE and well worth the price. Their oversized pancakes and flavorful sausage links make the meals.   SERVICE: The waitresses here have all been working for Ronnie's for years now. Many of them are super friendly and prompt on service. I've never had any issues or unpleasant experience with them.   OVERALL: Overall I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great breakfast or lunch who is in the valley. After years of coming here I have never been disappointed. The food is cheap and the quality is outstanding.",

There were ducks and random things on the wall, so it had a vintage feel.   We were seated be immediately ordered some coffee. I'm not sure if it's me or if the coffee just tastes better at little places like this. I felt, as if, I were in a small town diner. The menu had it all, pancakes to dinner items. I wanted to se what their breakfast was about, so ordered the corn beef and hash, eggs over easy and substituted my bread for a tortilla (I do this everywhere). I'm always iffy about corn beef has at restaurants because I can't stand the stuff in a can. I knew it was going to be good when it came out because it looked so good all over their potatoes. I ripped my tortilla and grabbed a piece of that hash and dunked it into the middle of my over easy eggs and stuffed it into my mouth. Immediately, I tasted savory flavors and it was oooohhhh so real and amazing! I almost ate the entire plate and trust me these portions are huge. I just couldn't stop myself, so good thing I went on that hike before eating. I'll be back for more of that hash!",

Seems like a lot of people that dine here are regulars I noticed waitstaff acknowledging customers by name which I thought was pretty cool. The waitress we had was polite and patient it took us forever to figure out what we were going to eat. Portions are pretty big, and everything was hot and delicious. I didn't finish all my food and had popped by my parents when I told my dad where we were coming From he said he loves this place and he goes here with friends which I had no idea and he ate my leftovers lol. I'll definitely be back!",

Clean up service kept on taking our plates while we are still eating from them. This older shorter fellow with hat and glasses kept circling around our table every two minutes to take our stuff. It got so bad that while my wife was boxing the items and leaving some food for my daughter that we had to yell at him to stop as we are not done.  Please do yourselves a favor learn to be patient with your customers. We were about to leave anyway it was just a matter of waiting one more minute for us to  completely finish and leave with a positive outlook on this place rather than trying to clean up early and create a negative experience for us.",

Was looking for a new breakfast spot to try this morning and they were close. This was Saturday morning and the place was pretty busy. We was seated within 5 min. of arriving.  The decor is what I wold call unique. Very unique. Almost like waking into a boutique. Many pictures, plates, cups, magnets. Lots of stuff for sale. Or at least there was price tags on the items. Some of the carpentry work looked almost temporary. Nailed in place but never quite finished. Plenty of light and not so loud where you and the person you was with could not talk easily.  The service. We were treated as valued guests. There were several times to fill the coffee cups and to check if you needed anything else.  The meals. This was breakfast. I got their two eggs, potatoes, toast. Not a complicated meal and it was very good. Way more potatoes than I could eat. I got rye toast and it was better than most places I get rye toast at. My wife got the cinnamon french toast. They make the cinnamon bread there and my wife said it was good. They could have a broader selection of syrup.  Conclusion?? Good place eat breakfast. Food is reasonable priced and good. Service we received was very good. Have a nice day Enjoy",

I had a sirloin steak, with two eggs over easy, a huge portion of home fries, and a wonderful buttermilk biscuit and it only cost me $6.95! I will definitely be back to this place and we'll be bringing friends next time, so glad I found this little gem. I have not tried them yet but I saw others ordering these enormous strawberry pancakes that were like 14 inches wide I would guess! All the portions seem enormous here, can't wait to try some more of this yummy food!",

We have been coming here for years and they have just lost a good customer because of a hostess's decision to be disrespectful.  Which is something that is just not acceptable.  Oh.  In the off chance there is some confusion as to why we will not return?  WENDY is the reason.  Rudeness will not be tolerated.

I requested my eggs over medium and received them over easy (fine not a problem) but the bacon was sooo limp, My guess it was microwaved. The coffee was probably the biggest disappointment, very weak and watered down. I sat at the bar to eat my food and could hear the servers gossip about the clients.

They served me a rotten smelly piece of yellowing NY strip steak with my breakfast. Had it removed and replaced with rotten smelly sausage links and patties. The gravy for the biscuits had the same stench as the rotten meat. I think they used the juice from the putrid meat to flavor the gravy. The odor was so bad it was triggering our gag reflexes continuously! Absolutely disgusting and ruined our appetite completely. Hoping to salvage some of the food, I scraped my remaining food onto the toast plate so it would not be contaminated by the smelly steak juice. It didn't help! My son could not finish his breakfast either! They did remove the steak from the bill but charged for the smelly sausage. Total for this garbage was over $20. We were both wondering why there were numerous full plates of food on various tables but no customers were seated there. I think after one whiff they just up and left. Good for them...saved a trip to the ER! The busser would quickly scoop them up as they left. After we gave the busser our unfinished plates of garbage you could still detect the smell of rotten meat. YUCK!  No wonder they are dog friendly... They're probably cadaver dogs! Ha ha We prob won't be able to eat a traditional type breakfast for weeks if not months!",

The menu includes French toast, biscuits and gravy, shit on a shingle, about 15 different omelets, steak and eggs, chicken fried steak and eggs, Belgian waffles, breakfast burritos, etc and lunch items. With almost every breakfast, you get real home-style potatoes and choice of bread. If I go here, I don't eat the rest of the day. Every entree is less than $10 and if you come weekdays before 10:30, there's quite a few specials under $5. Awesome feeling to be full all day for less than $10.  I've being coming here for about 4 years and is my go to for a hangover meal or a hearty meal with my dad.",

To fortify ourselves for a long day driving around the valley, a visiting friend and I went to this place after finding it on yelp. The place has a nice at-ease vibe about it, with friendly staff and cute and kitschy decorative items covering the walls. We found out upon closer inspection that all those items on the wall are for sale, and were very inexpensive without looking cheap. My friend ordered the eggs, hash browns, sausage, and homemade bread. I ordered the $5.99 steak and eggs, plus a side of 1 pancake which turned out to be huge. We sampled each other's orders; everything was good and I especially liked my steak, which I ordered medium and was thick, tasty and juicy - a really great deal for the price. Once again, thanks to yelp for letting this foodie find a great place to eat on a limited budget.",

Even getting our soup we requested ahead of time took awhile and it was just warm when we got it. It was good though. When our meals finallllyy came I was so disappointed. I know everyone has their own variation of SOS but this was not the recipe I cared for. Too much pepper and I didnt like the choice of meat they used.

When we walked in we were seated immediately, so I thought this may be good, the place was packed which was also a good sign. First off we were seated right by the front door which could be the reason we had so many issues. First issue was that the table was in the waiting area so as people waited for their table they stand inches from your table looking at items that the restaurant is selling. Secondly our waitress who probably had tables in the main part of the restaurant had no knowledge that we had been seated so until she came to give someone else their check that's when she noticed us, from the time we sat down til we ordered was well over 20 minutes. Third issue was my wife ordered the Country Benedict and when it came out it was very cold, it is very easy to notice when gravy has been sitting out and this plate was obviously sitting in the window to be delivered to us for quite sometime. When my wife pointed it out to the waitress she took it back and I am guessing was reheated in a microwave, now I am not a food critic or chef but I would never reheat poached eggs in a microwave . When the waitress brought them back they were just as cold. My wife ate the sausage but at this point we were ready to go. The reason for the two stars was I ordered the Florentine omelet and it was actually very good, tasty and filling, but hard to eat comfortably as my wife had to wait for her food to be reheated. Lastly when I asked about a military discount the waitress responded by saying, \"since we do the 9/11 special we feel that's enough\". I really wanted to like this place, just all these issues made it impossible.",

I went I to Ronnie's today around 9am, was not greeted \"Eye to Eye\" but instead I received a \"be with you in a minute\" with a back turned. Once we were seated we had a minute to gaze around at all the interesting items for sale On the walls, pretty cool to have things to look at.  The server brought us waters and hunched down into a squat and assumed we were ready to order(I hadn't even noticed the menu in front of me). So I felt obligated to hurry up and order so I built my own omelette(can't go wrong with that) and my mom ordered the waffle meal. Again, the coffee was great. So our food came out (a rubber or another server delivered) and it was all pretty cold except the omelette. It looks like they had everything ready to go and just added the egg portions on the way out. Even the toast tasted old.  Anyway, I just asked for New toast because I don't really like complaining or sending anything back. The omelette was the best thing there although it is not served with any fixings like sour cream or anything so you'll need to order that on your own. The waffle was bland, the bacon was crispy(good crispy, the home fries were good(better  hey were fresh). So I would not have an issue going back but I'd rather hit up \"The Place\" near by for not only more bang for your buck but a fresher and more friendly experience.",

The benedict for me was good, but the country gravy wasn't knock my socks off spectacular, I've had better. The food didn't take long but when our plates came out the food was just 'warm.'

Filled our coffees & water regularly and checked on us periodically to see if we needed anything else. Food came out quickly and we ordered country fried steak (2 orders) with pan potatoes, biscuit and gravy & Codd Combo with French toast & eggs. The meal country fried steak was delicious BUT the French toast could have been better. I would definitely come back if I'm ever in Glendale again. It was also inexpensive about 8-10 a plate (with daily specials of $5-8).",

I'll save you the details but we got our food 30 min after we ordered.  On top of that it came out spread over the next 15 min. The place has severe management issues. Somone needs to show them how to run a restaurant with some efficiency. Luckily I don't live in phx so this won't be an issue for me again.",

I can be a fairly big eater at times and I found one pancake to be more than enough. My wife's omelette was also large to the point where she had leftovers. We found the bill to be very reasonable. The biggest issue this place has is slow service, but in fairness it is a busy place on a Sunday morning. One thing that I found interesting is that you can buy antiques that are hanging on the wall. We didn't indulge in that, but it was kind of neat to see.",

    "text": "Went for an early morning/late night breakfast with the hubby. The atmosphere was lovely, the patrons seemed happy and the wait staff was great. My coffee was never empty! I ordered the French toast with a twist (the twist is that they make their own bread) and it was divine. My only gripe is that there wasn't more! My husband ordered the western omelette with home potatoes (or home fries maybe?) and it was huge. Too much food for him to finish. He enjoyed his as well, commenting on the ham specifically being delicious. I was very pleased with the overall service, surroundings, price and the food. My one bad note (which is not too big a deal really- certainly nothing to keep you from visiting this lovely sweet and homey little place) is that I ordered a side of fresh fruit (HUGE serving!) that had some chucks of ice in it and the pineapples were canned and completely flavorless. I do believe this to have just been a one in a million type of thing, but noted nonetheless for the honesty of the restaurant review. I suggest you check it out and come hungry!",

Even if you live in the east valley it's well worth the drive. Some of the food I highly recommend are the pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, rubins, and meatloaf.    Another huge plus to this place is there price, I guarantee you will not do any better. I have eaten here about 10 times and have always been happy with the food and service.  This is a place if your ever in Phoenix you have to check out.  I wish there were more place like Ronnie's Cafe.",

It's not fancy or gourmet, but it's seasoned well and tastes good. My bf always gets the steak & eggs special and for the price, it's always very good (potential for chewy cheap steak, but it's not). The only criticism I can give is that since they expanded the dining room last year, the kitchen sometimes gets backed up when they are swamped (more seats but no extra kitchen = slower food) so you will sometimes wait a little longer for your food. We always have some type of special request on our order (extra cheese or sauce, no sausage, etc) and they always get it right.   I definitely recommend Ronnie's, and have sent many friends there, but if you've never been there before, you may want to go on a week day when they aren't so swamped. But... the place is swamped for a reason.",

    "text": "Just because you get a massive plate of food at this place, it does not warrant good marks. Yesterday's breakfast was one of the top worst overall experiences that we have ever had in a restaurant.  First my expectation was not set high at all being it was New Year's Day. We had nine people in out group and put ourselves on the list and waited patiently. At least that was until I noticed a large group leave and them split up the multiple tables put together to make a large table, and begin seating 2 person parties that came in after us. Yes we were next on the list. It took me saying something for them to realize the error and put some tables back together and get us a seat. We ordered drinks and food after 15min of sitting while the server was running around to all her other tables.  Then, she didn't come back to check on us for over 45min.  Our drinks were empty, adults were frustrated and kids getting restless. Everyone in the restaurant could see what was happening to us, some sharing their own frustration with us.  When we finally had the server come back after 45min, she let me know they just got to our ticket and were out of the hash I ordered.  It was pretty funny how I could see the kitchen quite well and watched plenty of tickets put up after ours, get pulled before ours and filled.  Anyway, I choose plan B for breakfast and we waited some more. Now its an hour since we ordered and the restaurant is beginning to clear out and we still have no food. Lots of customers sat after us have got their food and left. The waitress comes back and offers nothing but excuses as to why we still have not eaten. My brother in law, finally got up and left.  We all should of left at this point but the kids really were starving.  It was now after 12 noon and we had come in around 10:00am. Food eventually came and was OK. Not great by any means. Not worth the wait or the fact most of our order was wrong. We had our breakfast boxed and left.  As we were leaving, I hear the same server we had, telling another customer that they just got to his ticket and had run out of hash.  The server knew 20 min before this that they were out of hash.  Any reason she had no commmon sense to inform that customer sooner?   Needless to say, we will NEVER eat here again and don't suggest anyone else does that expects at least a little service with their meal.",
