That aside, my boyfriend and I have been here twice and have been blown away both times. We order the samosas, lamb vindaloo, chicken tiki masala, a veggie dish I can't remember the name of, garlic naan, and basmati. The first time we ordered a spice level of 8 and the second time 9. I'd prefer somewhere in between.   The food makes it to the table quickly and is full of flavor. The two times we've been there for dinner, the service has been friendly and attentive, so I'm confused by the yelpers who bag on the wait staff.  We spent about 50 dollars on a ton of food (half is in the fridge to be enjoyed tomorrow as well) and it's always worth it.   There's also a small market with a wide selection of authentic spices, marinades, chutneys and other ingredients so you can attempt to cook Indian at home.  We crave this restaurant constantly and would recommend it to anyone who thinks they know good Indian food!",

I couldn't believe it. I love spices and Indian food has a lot of them and they are very tasty, but bell peppers make me nauseous and give me indigestion. They few things that didn't have peppers, like their spinach dish, were oily and not really creamy like they should be. Overall- inauthentic and disappointing. I've never been so full yet so dissatisfied. I told the shift supervisor so hopefully they will fix the bell pepper issue, until then my advise is to go somewhere else. It's not worth the $30 bill.",

I thought the naan was below average and tasted more like flatbread than what naan is supposed to taste like. My dish was the chicken tikka masala and it just lacked flavor and any hint of spiciness. I did get the mango shake and it was truly excellent!  The waiter seemed quite inpatient throughout the night. On a couple instances he assumed what we meant instead of getting clarification; thus, bringing out the wrong thing. Then the restaurant turned off the music 10 minutes before closing and basically tried to rush us out. Seriously??? Not a way to keep business coming back! I mean, chill out... most of us were pretty much finishing up at that point so at least give the diners the courtesy of a full experience.  Too many better options to want to come back here...",

There wasn't much to choose from and what was there was kinda old, looks like it was sitting out for a while. I basically just at the chicken Marsala and rice, which I enjoyed.

We go for the buffet pretty much only for tikka masala! We ALWAYS receive extraordinary service, and the waiters always bring fresh, hot naan to us within minutes of arriving. ONLY complaint is that when we first started coming here years ago, there was actual cheese in the palak paneer. No more. There also used to be pistachios on the rice dessert. No more. I understand they may be trying to keep the price low, but I'd rather pay a little more and have the palak paneer made correctly.

    "text": "A friend invited me to the buffet they have here for our birthday. Unfortunately it ended 2 minutes after we walked in the door at 4:30pm. So we opted for 2 complete dinner. It was allot of food, which I enjoyed for work the next day. Everything was delicious with the exception of some tough as nails plant in a very bitter/chemical like sauce. They should drop that item from the menu. It was just a small side dish and might be preferred by some, but I'd only serve it to people that ask for it. The Tandoori Chicken was outstanding along with the Shrimp Masal we had. Honestly, I would have been happy just eating the sauce.  All in all it was very good. I will go there again. I would recommend they serve their buffet a little later and they might get more just after work customers.  PS: They have some lovely Indian beers to enjoy. Try one.",

I ordered my favorite, Palak Paneer, hubby ordered Tandoori chicken and we got white rice and plain naan for the table. Naan was excellent and rice was plentiful and perfectly fluffy. Hubby's chicken was a little dry but flavorful. My dish tasted like watery spinach with no detectable spice or flavor let alone heat. I ordered a spice level 3 since this was our first visit; I have no idea what a level 1 would have been!! Overall, a disappointment and probably won't be back as there are plenty of other Indian places in the area. I did like their attached store... They had tons of rice, lentils, flours, spices, and ready made items for home cooks. Will be back for that.",

The best item on the buffet was the Gulab Jamon (sweet). I visited the establishment with my wife. We had their lunch buffet, and both of us not thrilled with the food. Service was OK. The lunch buffet is inexpensive, but this should not dictate the quality of the food. If they feel that they need to charge more in order to raise the quality, then that's what management should do. Until then, I'd skip this place for a while... Since I did not afterwards have the runs, I give it a two star!",

Everything else was good too and we got several items. The take out service was pretty fast. The four stars is because they didn't  serve rice with any of the dishes we ordered and most of them are usually served over rice. I had ordered a side of rice for the kids and that was the only rice that came with the meal.  We would definitely order from here again.",

Priced at a reasonable $10 the styrafoam carton i packed with rice, veggie curries, pakoras, and tandoori chicken will feed me for days. Each to-go buffet is portioned one piece of delicious fresh naan.   The curries were just okay (palek paneer, daal makhaini,  and aloo mutter). Palek \"paneer,\" while flavorful, was disappointingly served without the paneer, my favorite part. Both the daal makhaini, aloo mutter were watery. The pakoras tasted like yesterday's leftovers, reheated and thrown on the buffet line. Mint chutney was delicious, some of the best i've had. The raita, also watery, added an extra tang to the curries. The tandoori chicken (legs n' thighs) while tasty, are a bit dry.    Overall, I'd prefer the home-cooked and spicy palek paneer from Udupi Cafe. But for the price and convenience, the to-go lunch buffet from Indian Delhi Palace is a great deal.",

    "text": "Yum!!  The Chicken Tikka Masala, Bengan Bhartha (eggplant), rice, naan, and Punjabi lassis (one sweet, one salty) were all delicious.  The salty lassi was kinda interesting with different spices, not just salt.  For the entrees, the \"medium\" had just the right amount of heat.  Good sized portions too.  Five stars for food.    I would call the service \"leisurely\" but not bad.  It was definitely a team effort, with 4 different people approaching the table at various times and slight confusion at one point.    One thing to keep in mind: there's a party room upstairs, and you can totally hear the bass downstairs in the restaurant.  We asked to move to the other room, and then it wasn't as loud but we could still hear it.  We were hungry and had our hearts set on Indian food so we stayed, but this would not have been ideal for a special occasion or first date.  I don't know how often they have these parties, so to be on the safe side you may want to stick to weeknights here.",

    "text": "In my mind, there are two types of Indian restaurants in the Valley that I can afford to eat at.  There's the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge TV displaying Indian MTV or soap operas, and largely do-it-yourself service. (See: Kohinoor)  If I'm feeling like spoiling myself, I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls, friendly waitstaff, and a-la-carte style menus instead of \"specials.\"  After a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.  The waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.  The palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.  RE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.  The lady ordered vegetable bhriyani, which is sort of our Indian comfort food, and it didn't disappoint.  Flavorful rice with tons of veggies.  Indian Delhi Palace has good food, good service, and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood.",

They actually have a small grocery store attached to the restaurant.  As I entered the restaurant my world was curry.  My toothache disappeared and I wanted to sit down and grub.   Beautiful decor:  Very Indian, nice table sets and even nicer glass goblets and interesting utensils.    Service was excellent.  The curry chicken was DELISH.  Everything is A la carte.  So be prepared to pay for rice as a side dish.    I could've sworn the mango drink was freshly made.  Great companion to the spicy dish.  Ah the sweet and spicy.  Between my date and I everything came up to about 30 bucks.   If we had came in just an hour earlier it would've been 20 because of the buffet.  Oh well next time.  And there will be a next time.  Check out the grocery store as well.  They cater to those who want to prepare their own Indian variations.  My hunny promises he will be my guinea pig.",

The only saving grace was that the food we did have was pretty good.  The chicken tikka masala was really salty on the second trip to the buffet.  Strange almost like they dumped a cup of salt in.

What we had was a hearty, flavorful, fresh, vegetarian meal. There is plenty of meat on the menu as well.  My wife and I both ordered the Vegetable Korma, which was full of fresh veggies in a rich, aromatic curry. We tried two different breads -- one was doughy and stuffed with cauliflower and the other was a crispy whole wheat. They were totally different from each other, yet both were fantastic.  Each staff member was friendly, responsive and never devoid of a smile. A nice, intimate atmosphere, perfect for a quiet and economical meal.

There was a full tray of the curry only. My husband asked about this, and the waiter said he'd find out. When my husband asked again, the waiter said the kitchen had chopped up the paneer and put it in the curry. I don't like calling people liars, but when we sampled some we didn't see or taste and cheese. I've been to India and never seen such a thing, and my friends from India haven't either. One thing I love about Indian food that separates it from other curries is that they have cheese curry, so this was quite the bummer. If you aren't a stickler like me, you will love this place. Excellent flavor on everything.",

I ordered Veggie Korma, he got the Chicken Tikka Masala,  and we shared some Naan and the 'assorted snacks' (Vegetable Pakora, Samosa, Sheesh Kabab, Papadum). Everything was DELICIOUS.

All the food is hot and fresh, and they are constantly bringing in warm bread and new refills.  The chicken curry is even better with the addition of red and green bell peppers, but everything else is just as tasty.  The building the restaurant is located in is perfect. It looks like it was built for this restaurant alone, and I gotta say I was impressed. There was even an Indian Grocery inside which was cool to look around in.  I had a great experience here and I'm sure anyone else who enjoys Indian Cuisine would as well.",

    "text": "Two reasons for coming here:  1) You love Indian Food 2) You love to sample a variety of dishes   My first visit to the palace was on a Friday, for the lunch buffet.  For $7.99, you have your pick of Tandoori Chicken, a delicious chicken Curry, Three Vegetable Curries, Basmati Rice, Daal, Naan, and. Salad. To complete your feast, they offer Kheer (rice pudding with almond and pistachio) and Gulab Jamun (Two balls akin to donut holes - made from cream of milk in scented light syrup).  The greatest thing about this buffet is that it is \"western\" friendly.  This means that none of the curries are too spicy, and even the mint chutney is not over-powered by peppers and chilies.  For your first experience with Indian food, this is a terrific spot.  If a seasoned veteran of this cuisine, you may be more picky where flavor is concerned.  I personally feel the buffet had very slim pickings, especially for someone that enjoys diversity in dining.  However, I thought the tikka masala, chicken curry, daal, pakoras, and saag were sooo delicious.  I am interested in returning here to explore its dinner options.  For example, along with the varying lamb, chicken, and vegetarian dishes Indian Delhi Palace offers - they have complete dinners for under $20.  For instance, the chicken dinner includes One Papadum, One Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Curry, One Daal Maharani, One Plate of Basmati Rice, One Naan, One Ratia, One Dessert, Chutney and Tea.",

    "text": "Delhi Palace saved my dinner party! I was getting over a nasty 24-hour bug, and was panicked about how on earth I was going to be able to pull off a vegetarian duel birthday dinner party for my Scorpio-signed, non-meat eating folks.   My boyfriend suggested ordering a bunch of food for everyone. I was non-too-thrilled by this suggestion, but felt I had nothing better to offer. Cooking, cleaning and preparing for the party would have surely put me over the edge, so I went along with it.  The responsibility of ordering for everyone sort of put me in a state of quiet anxiety, but I knew I needed to bite the bullet.  Ordering for 13 people I got the following:  APPS 3 Vegetable Pakora (6/order) apps - too salty, over done, wouldn't order again 5 Samosa (2 large per order) apps - we split them in 2 so there would be 20. They were gone in minutes.  So delicious, and really reasonable at $2.49/order DINNER 1 Vegetable Korma - excellent, should have ordered 2 of them 2 Daal Maharani - excellent, and there was nothing left 2 Bengan Bharta - too salty, wouldn't order this again, hardly touched 2 Palak Paneer - excellent, a True hit 1 Malai Kofta - delicate and delicious  Oh, how could I forget, we ordered lots of Garlic Naan, and a platter of Basmati rice.  The apps came with mint chutney and tamarind chutney, and I ordered raita (cool whipped yogurt) to drizzle over the spicy preps.  Dinner was around $170. It was entirely worth it.  No stress, no mess, and everyone was thanking us for the Indian treats. Plus, we had Indian food for dinner the next night!  What I gleaned from this experience was I could have definitely ordered less food.  There was tons of left overs.  I would say that one dinner dish safely satisfies 2 guests.  Favorites were: Palak Paneer, Vegetable Korma, Daal Maharani, Garlic Naan, Samosas.  One last thing, this place has the best Indian Buffet in town... if you're into that sort of thing (wink).",

We looked over the menu but decided after all on the buffet, it was a good idea to try some new things since I always get matar paneer.   I filled a plate and proceeded to stuff my face.. in classy form, of course. The Aloo Mattar had the perfect amount of spice and an immense amount of flavor. It was impressive, as was the chicken curry, the rice, and the chicken masala. I was in heaven! The garlic naan was perfect. Everything was right with the world..  Then the bad news came. Not fifteen minutes after we sat down with our first plates filled were we told the buffet was going to close soon. Had we known earlier, well, I'm not sure what we would do. But it sure is lucky we are a couple of small ladies who can't really eat more than one overfilled plate.. I thought.  I finished my plate and decided to have more aloo mattar, rice, and then some raiti and fritters. Then I got some of the coconut basmati rice. Oh everything just.. sighhh. I think it was the first time I've really been rendered speechless by food in a long time.   tl;dr Service was friendly but didn't come around often enough to fill our drinks, food is incredible, the place is relaxing and aesthetically appealing inside.  They lost a star for the failure to tell us we had fifteen minutes to enjoy the buffet and for being a little lagging on the refilling of drinks.",

So I decided to try the rather palatial-looking India Delhi Palace in East Phoenix because I had heard good things about its lunch buffet.  Luckily, my foodie friends aren't liars.   I arrived shortly before the lunch rush. I was greeted promptly and politely. I then asked if the buffet had a large selection of vegetarian options, and he actually gave me a brief but thorough tour of the veggie offerings, which, much to my delight, comprised much of the buffet. I promptly filled my plate with aloo matar and daal maharani. But don't worry, omnivores; there were plenty of delicious-looking meat dishes on the slate as well.   The food was very tasty, but what makes this place stand up above other Indian buffets was the exceptional, attentive service. A team of servers worked to make sure I received fresh naan with my meal, my water glass was always filled and any questions I had were answered. I don't expect much in the way of help when it comes to buffets, so this was a pleasant surprise.   I will definitely be back one of these days to try something from the menu (bengan bhartha, I'm looking at you).",

Kind of a WTH look came across our faces?? I mean did he kind of lure us to buffet it...away from menu...just to rush us ?? Yeah...no.. wrong... SO, we proceed to get another selection of items on another plate.. small table now full.. as they took away the buffet.. I mean, are you serious!? Just let a customer know that when they sit... 'oh btw, get your buffet.. if not its going away...'..  The naan rocked.. its large and enough for 3... I just always feel at a buffet per norm.. I dont get my moneys worth.. I dont eat alot..

It seems that decent Indian is hard to come by out here, so I tend to stick with the same couple of places.My usual Indian haunt is Flavors of India, because the food is mostly good and it's close, but I think this place is a close second. The things that Flavors does well, Delhi Palace does so so on. And vice versa.   Where Delhi Palace shines: (within the confines of today's buffet, of course)  Palak Paneer- even though the paneer was noticeably absent or microscopic Bengan Bhartha- My eggplant-hating dining companion even liked it.  Mutter Paneer- The one dish with peas that i'll eat willingly.  The service- they weren't in your face, but they were around more than most buffet meals.  The atmosphere- it's classy without being over the top gaudy.   Where Flavors of India kicks Delhi Palace's hiney:  Naan- I prefer the flattened, nearly scorched naan to the fluffy puff that was plopped on the table here. It was fresh though, so bonus points for that.  Tandoori chicken- The flavor was fantastic, but the meat was dry.  Yellow lentil daal- I'll save my colorful description of this one and just leave it at Blech.  Curry chicken- Where's the spice? Possibly the blandest curry chicken ever.  The water- This sounds weird, but every time the server came by to refill water, we ended up with more UFOs (unidentifiable floating objects) in our glasses.   Overall, I think it's a toss-up. The things that I like about Delhi Palace are the things that my old stand by place doesn't do well. I'll definitely be back, but not for the curry or lentils.",

Two dishes, a rice and two naans was enough food for three plus enough leftover for a fourth diner.  So even though the prices are a bite high, it works out in the end.  Mango Lassi - creamy and refreshing, not too sweet Chicken Masala - sauce was a little thick but well spiced Malai Kofta - sauce was a better consistency but was not a fan of the homemade cheese balls Peas Pulaou - ok Plain and Garlic Naan - both good but the garlic one kicks it up a notch.",

The naan is very good, has a buttery taste that goes great with your meal.

Con- i dont think the price of the food matched the quality but i say you should go and see for yourself.   The garlic naan was not garlic flavored and not much to write home about.  The service did not meet normal expectations as they didnt use seat assigment when delivering food so it was like a cattle auction on who ordered which dish.  Also, the server was not attentive so we have to chase him down a couple of time. We were missing dishes and had to ask for them more than once. Dinner was at 6:30 and we didnt get to leave until 9:30.  Even for a party of 9, 3 hours is way too long.  We were waiting for them more often then the restaurant waiting for us.    I understand not all places will split a check so this is more of an FYI.",

The location has plenty of parking and serves thier buffet from 11-4:30 for lunch, which is great if you are running late for lunch during the week.  They offer many of the familar basics and the food is brought out pretty consistently.  The flavors are good, not great and not very spicy. Most items are mild, which is probably done so that it can suit more people.  I am used to most being at least medium.  The location has comfortable seating and lots of it. They are attentive and it is very clean. They have both meat and vegetarian options as well and they are served on separate parts of the buffet.    Check them out if you are nearby and if you have never tried indian food because you are worried it's too spicy, this may be a good place to give it a try.",

The cooking of the food is pretty inconsistent. We've ordered the same dishes more than once (saag paneer, tikka masala, chana masala) and they can taste completely different every time! Like the actual taste of the dish can be totally different depending on which cook is working that day. Also when you tell them the level of spiciness, this is also wildly inconsistent. Once we got \"spicy\" and it was so spicy that it gave us stomachaches and it was a challenge to finish the dishes. And seriously, we are people who love spice. We love to have our mouths burned. But this was insane. And then another time we got \"medium spicy\" for one dish and \"spicy\" for another dish, and neither were any detectable level of spicy.  They also gave us chicken in one dish when we ordered lamb, and it said lamb on the receipt, and we paid for lamb.  Overall, we like the dishes, and they're good, but it's become too much of a gamble to order from here and so we're more than likely to look elsewhere next time we need our Indian food fix.",

I found that many of the items were moderately spicy and this could be an issue to someone who is sensitive to spiciness.  Our favorite thing hands down was the veggie pakora - the deep fried mixed veggie fritter.  Their naan was also delicious and my second favorite thing.  Service was great - no complaints!

The dining area has plenty of seating for individuals or groups of different sizes, and I was given a seat at a table for two. Water and a basket of freshly made naan bread quickly followed.The buffet offered most of the Indian restaurant standards. I sampled a bit of everything and found most of the offerings to be very good, except for the pakora (vegetable fritters) which were on the dry side. I came back for more servings of aloo matar and chicken tandoori, which I liked the most from the array served that day.

However, we didn't eat a $3 item because it wasn't fresh and tasted bad and our server insisted it was good and didn't take it off our bill. Also, we were sat where we could hear clanging pans and dishwashing happening.  The food was not the best Indian food I've ever had, not the worst, just okay. My biggest issue was that we were there for an early dinner and it seemed like most of it had just been transferred from the lunch buffet. It definitely wasn't fresh and vibrant like good Indian food can be.  Final note, my SO doesn't like anything too crazy spicy, so ordered medium spiciness for everything. However, the soup we ordered was too spicy for him to eat. Once we paid I found on the receipt that the soup had been input as spice level 7 and our entrees, which weren't very spicy at all, were input as spice level 4. Why?",

And this place did a fantastic job. The Biryani was a little lack luster but it still had great flavor. The cashier guy was super nice, he engaged in painful small talk with me haha. That's a plus!

The host and the staff were inviting and friendly but not talkative, which was perfectly fine.  As for the food, I had the lunch buffet which included a sampling of the goat korma, aloo matar, tandoori chicken, and chicken tikka masala. They also provided a fresh piece of buttered naan bread on the side which was good but not amazing as it was a bit doughy than how I usually have had my naan. The chicken tikka masala was good but the chicken was slightly dry. The tandoori chicken was great as it was flavorful and moist. The goat korma was decent, as it was pretty similar to the lamb korma's that i have had before. The aloo matar was also very tasty.  Overall the meal was enjoyable and the buffet was quite fresh as none of the dishes tasted old (I cannot say the same about copper kettle's buffet). The price is reasonable a for the amount of food.  As for comparisons, I believe The Dhaba is better quality and flavor wise but they don't have buffets and they are pricier than most Indian restaurants. Copper Kettle had better naan but this place has them beat in freshness and cleanliness.",

My husband and I are big paneer fan, we loved their Shahi Paneer, and Malai Koftas of their Ala carte menu. Their Raita is really good too. The only draw back is that they charge for plain rice. Usually rice is given with curries for free. I chose to over look that glitch because the food was so good. I hope this helps!",

Have eaten almost every vegetarian dish on the menu and d*mn do they do it right! Amazing flavor, spice level is pretty precise. If ur going to get a 7/10 you'll need a water standing by, other than that its amazing spices as you requested.  Bf is in love with the Mixed Grill- as a non meat eater I have to say: it looks and smells AMAZING! And per his review its the best things he's ever eaten. A little pricey at 18$ but he says its worth it. Watching him eat it- I completely agree. :)  Been eating here for the past 3 years and even though the customer service has yet to take a giant step forward I still keep stepping through their doors, inhaling those delicious spices, picking up my 'to go' order and grinning like a thief as I enjoy it for days and days to come. :)",

The food is great! It's nice because they adjust the spice level for you from 1-10 and the lunch buffet is relatively not spicy.  I usually order chicken tikka masala, rice, and garlic naan and I always have leftovers for the next day. This is a welcoming place and a good restaurant to introduce your friends to Indian food.",

    "text": "There was a time, in infancy of this restaurant, that it was one of our go to lunch spots for our growing and thriving DotCom.  I had taken my daughters here countless of times. However, over the years, its luster had faded away as far as our palate appeal was concerned. There was never really anything wrong, it was just that there were now so many options, and we drifted away from one of the places that used to be our standard for Indian Cuisine Buffets.  My daughter had flown into town to greet her Dad a Happy Birthday, before she jets off to another country in a few days.  Since here memories of this place were no longer as vivid, she wanted to catch up and relieve one of her childhood standards.  This place is still quite elegant, and well appointed. The buffet has the typical dishes that one would expect; e.g., Tandoori Chicken, Tikka Masala, Basmati Rice, Saag Paneer, and several others.  We used to describe these dishes by their colors - The Red, the Orange, the White, and The Green ones, respectively.  Of course, there were other dishes, and desserts, but these have always been part of the main course.  The flavors of the dishes are still quite distinct and quite tasty. Nothing seemed overdone, overcooked, or overspiced. And their service is top notch. Their attentiveness to fill our glasses, provide copious amounts of Naan Bread, and clear our table of finishes plates were quite commendable.  The one additional that we did get to experience was the Jalebi. They are rounded, orange, sweet pretzel sticks. They definitely add a great dimension to those that have sweet tooths!  The place definitely has a quiet and relaxed atmosphere, and we never felt rushed to finish or intruded upon during our prolonged conversations.  And as far as a buffet is concerned, this is a great bargain; and a wonderful dining experience for those looking for alternatives to the typical lunch selections.",

The service is also attentive and will continue to refill drinks and replace empty dishes. The complimentary naan that comes with the lunch is great and is replenished often (I tend to eat a lot of naan and they were very accommodating). My favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala, which has great flavor and the meat itself is cooked tenderly.    One con that really stood out to me was the lack of variety. Although the flavors and tastes of the available entrees were great, there wasn't much room for different types of food. I would estimate that there are 4 meats (the most recent time I went, there were only 2 chicken dishes and 2 lamb dishes) and maybe 4 vegetarian options. Unlike other Indian buffets, there was also only regular white rice (briyani).   Aside from the lower amount of entrees, the food and service was great. I will be back for more of the delicious chicken tikka masala.",

The dishes were of low value- relatively high priced for what was included.  We thought that for the price, it was bound to be delicious.     Unfortunately this was not the case.  An $11 entree didn't even include rice or naan, so we paid $3.5 extra for a small bowl of rice.  The $21 combo dinner did include rice and naan, but when the best part of the combo is the raita, something is wrong.   I have never known Indian food to be bland, but that's exactly what I experienced here.  I don't like leaving negative reviews, but this one earned it.",

    "text": "I have high expectations for Indian food, given I've grown up eating it. I read a few negative reviews and noticed many of them all complained that the food was too spicy. You should really specify your heat tolerance when ordering, because the food here is spicier than at any other Indian restaurant I've been to in the Valley. But no complaints from here, I love spicy food! We came in a group for a birthday, and everybody loved what they ordered. The dinner combo is massive. I can't believe it's listed as dinner for one. I had the samosa chaat. I was very impressed. They were very generous with the chutney (which makes all the difference in chaat). My friend had been craving shahi paneer for months and said this place did not disappoint. What really impressed me was the dishes that the food was served in. My mango lassi tasted great in the authentic cup it was served in (see pic). Altogether, we had appetizers, main courses, a combo meal, and dessert and there were no complaints in the group. Generous portions and great environment! I am going to make this place my regular spot.",

Today I went with 4 coworkers and they charged us an additional 18% gratuity for a large party. First, a party of 5 is too small to incur the automatic 18% gratuity; it's 6 or 8 at most restaurants. Second, the 18% was added on for the lunch buffet. I wouldn't have minded as much if it was waited service since I usually tip that much anyway. However, a mandatory 18% for a lunch buffet for 5 people is ludicrous. There are plenty of Indian places around here that are just as good, if not better, and I will be patronizing them instead.",

    "text": "Let me just preface this review by saying that it does pain me to write a negative review about almost any establishment in the valley.  Unfortunately for India Delhi, it has to be done.  Honestly, I have not dined inside this restaurant, my experience is purely from multiple take out orders over the past year.  Living in Arcadia and loving food as I do, I am lucky in the fact that I do not have to travel far to enjoy ethnic culinary delights that other cultures have to offer.  If your a foodie in the 21st century, Indian food is all over your radar.  India Delhi, found at 54th street and McDowell in Phoenix, fits the bill of almost every other Indian restaurant in the valley. Nice external building, clean looking restaurant and the normal tinctures related to that region of the world.    Always friendly and eager to take your order, the young gentleman at the front counter has never let me down in taking care of my to go order. Always checking each container to make sure it has the correct contents, etc.  On the Saturday I am referencing for this review, the young man was not there, but the owner and his wife were. In my opinion, Indian food is not a cheap venture. I always find myself wanting to try a dish as well as getting a staple that I know is going to be solid. When you add in the extra charge for rice(never included), yogurt sauce(not included), etc, the bill for myself and companion always tops $40.  I usually do not gripe as I know the quality will be there and I just love the food, what can I say.  On this Saturday though, something was different. This was evident from the moment I walked in the door, I could not put my finger on it, but something was just not vibing.  The owners wife(or co owner for all I know) was at the counter and asked if I wanted the buffet. I politely turned it down as I am not a fan of buffet food, especially with Indian cuisine.  I politely turned that down and proceeded to order tandoori chicken, saag paneer, chicken biryani, basmati rice and some naan.    What happened next is not something I will forget soon.  I watched as the owner walked out of the kitchen with the pan in hands and used the spinach for my saag paneer from the buffet.  The owners and my eyes met as he processed that I saw what he was doing.  In that moment, the owner sold and gave up all his culinary credibility. He proceeded to head back to the kitchen to use said items.    I waited for another fifteen minutes and took my order home.  What did I find? The chicken biryani, the only item I might add not in the buffet, was extremely hot, almost too hot to touch.  The saag paneer was warm at best. The tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for Indian buffets) and once again, not hot.  I knew what had happened and could not help feeling beyond annoyed with the situation.   Normally, I just deal with what is, I do not ever send food back and especially on to-go orders.  This time was different, I could not let it go.  I called the restaurant and without pause the owner got on, knowing exactly who I was and what the problem was. He put up a fight for around 20 seconds saying that he just used the spinach as a base for the saag paneer and what not, but then finally just apologized and said he would \"make it right.\"    I do not really see myself going back here, but who knows.  This is a good excuse to venture out and try some more of the valleys offerings in this arena.",

Their veggie koorma, chicken curries, and tandoori are excellent and all served with their lunch buffet, along with their superb naan.  The buffet is probably the best buffet I've ever had, since they are usually populated with cheap meats, and mass produced sauces. This place is excellent, and every dish oozes real Indian spice and care.    Very highly recommended, though I've only tried them for lunch and don't know how and if their dinner would be different.",

    "text": "Went to Phoenix today visiting our son.  One of our favorite things to do is to find new Ethnic Restaurants.  We had some chores to do in and around Scottsdale and were craving some good Indian lunch Buffet.  We had heard about this place being a tasty and reasonable place to eat.  Funny, we got there fairly early even before noon on a Friday and the parking lot was full.  A good sign.  We walked into a beautifully appointed clean place with white table cloths, red napkins and that was another pleasant surprise The price for the buffet is $8.95 per person and well worth that. They were constantly filling up the trays.    The salad was crispy lettuce, tomatoes with an assortment of Indian dressings, a chutney, and some other wonderful dressing.  The chick pea salad was so good that I devoured 2 plates of that.  They also had a large bowl of what looked to be taco chips.  However, they were homemade and so crunchy with Indian flavoring.  I could have just eaten that alone.  I was pretty stuffed at this point.  The main dishes were Tandoori chicken, Curry chicken with a great sauce.  Another curry dish with potatoes and onions.   Of course rice and paneer which was also yummy.  A couple of simosa fritters which were a little tough but was still tasty.  Three different deserts.  Rice pudding was great to take the bite out of some of the moderately spicy  dishes.  Also a carrot pudding which if your'e Jewish reminded me of Tsimis. Not sure how to spell it.    There was also like a sponge cake ball fried crispy.  I just threw that into the rice pudding to end the meal.  The place was packed by the time we left about 1.30PM or so.  Lots of business people enjoying some heavenly treats.  Good price, good service.  What more can one ask for. No dinner for me tonight.",

Parking is easy Service is always fantastic Take-out is always ready very quickly and very hot Good variety of spices at the attached little store  Tried and recommend: Shahi paneer, chicken tikka masala, veg korma. chana masala Might revisit but not thrilled with initially: saag paneer, aloo gobi  If you like spicy (or not), tell them--they go kinda easy on the hotness unless you specifically ask (use the 1-10 scale)  I wish it was a little less formal feeling inside, but I typically do take-out so not a big deal--it just makes for a date-ish environment rather than a group o' friends environment.  Again, not a bad thing, i'm just sayin'. I've also never checked out the lunch buffet so maybe the white tablecloths and preset water glasses are a PM thing.

The owner Anil is always happy to have you back and he'll make sure you are pleased. It's located in a partially vacated strip mall on the southwest corner of 28th drive and Bell Rd. just one light west of the I-17 frwy. You might still have to squint to spot it from your car, on the inside corner of the elbow. Follow your nose once you exit your car,you can't miss it.

We've talked about this place for a while, and I'll be damned if I was leaving AZ before stopping by this place!  So luckily, I was able to convince one of the girls that finals are not as important as saying goodbye to me over a plate of curries.  We got their around 8 and the place had a good crowd.  We were the only white girls, so we know we were in for a good meal.  Going over the menu took us a while, because one of the girls had no clue what she wanted, and the server was polite enough to let us take our time.  Before we figured out what we wanted for dinner, of course we had to figure out drinks.  So we all order and still continue to peruse the menu.  Then our drinks came out...huge plus for this place right here, they were huge!  My gin and tonic was in an oversized cocktail glass and my friend's Chardonnay was filled to the brim.  No skimping on alcohol here!  The waiter advised us the drinks were strong, which I was fine with but my girlfriend needed 3 more limes to take hers down.  We finally end up decided on dinner, with the shahih paneer, chicken saag, and vegetable korma, and an order of garlic naan.  I was a little unsure about the paneer, but my girlfriends swore by it.  When the food arrived, we were excited!  Everything smelled so flavorful and the naan was huge, good thing we only got one order.  I loved every single bite I had at dinner, and the feeling was mutual across the table.  All of us ate beyond the point of feeling full, but we couldn't help ourselves!  This food was too good!  Luckily, we were able to stop ourselves and save some food to take home.  I got the chicken saag and I am so excited to have some for my own brunch.  Mmmmm...I'm getting hungry thinking about it now.  Overall, $20 a person including tip, with strong drinks, good food, and extras to take home we were satisfied.",

This variability includes flavors, texture, spice level and ingredients. Sometimes the dish is fantastic and sometimes it is only OK. We continue to come here because the food is usually pretty good, the turnaround for pick-up orders is quick, there is plenty of parking, the food is moderately priced AND there is nothing near us that is any better (for cost/easy of pickup). Definitively room for improvement here. Additionally, rice does not come with the curries; you are charged 3.50 extra.",

We ordered: Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala ($10.99), palak paneer ($8.99-spinach and \"cottage cheese\"), and goat masala (11.99?).  I'm not a frequenter of Indian cuisine establishments so i can't really compare it to others but the chicken tikka masala was AMAZING! Palak Paneer was also great. The goat masala was good, not gamey at all! They definitely don't clean the bones away very well so be careful not to chip a tooth. Server was not overly friendly but good enough between him and the 2 bussers who were prompt to refill our waters from ordering a little too high on the spicy scale :)  I need to come back for the lunch buffet for $8.99 sometime!",

The only thing that is making me hesitant to give that last star is their lunch buffet.  Not the biggest selection - which wasn't a huge deal... still plenty to eat. The problem was the temperature of everything.  I was seriously afraid that I was going to get food poisoning (I didn't, thank goodness).  This can not be a safe temp to keep food at for more than 10 minutes!  Although, the husband claims that it is pretty much the same at all Indian buffets... you can tell, I usually just order off the menu wherever I go.    Definitely stick to the menu, and your experience will be 5-stars.  Attempt the buffet at your own risk...",

I drove 20 mins keeping the biriyani in passenger seat. Didn't smell anything like biriyani.  It WAS YELLOW RICE WITH SOME BOILED CHICKEN SOME SLICED JALAPENO  AND TOMATO SLICE. Biriyani was $12. They charged  $3 for raita. First time I saw biriyani doesn't come with raita. They gave green and red chutney with the biriyani.  Who the hell eat green chutney with biriyani.

    "text": "I've basically gotten through the Indian lunch buffets in the Phoenix metropolitan area so now I'm trying out different places for take-out; I got take-out from here today and it was so positive an experience I wanted to change my review from 4 to 5 stars.   I got malai kofta, palak (no paneer), veg korma, papadum, and plain naan. I was really excited honestly b/c I haven't seen papadum on many restaurants' options for ordering takeout online and I love papadum. $1 gets you two full circles which seems, extremely reasonable. I did not get rice b/c I had some basmati left over but I'm sure it would have been fine and proportionately priced.   I just liked every step of the experience. You can order online through their website in a way that is very straight-forward, and which lets you specify what spice level you want, from 1-10. I was in the mood for mild food, so I just went 2-3 and I'll tell you what - that food was definitely a 2-3/10, with just the barest touch of spice.   I got a text confirming they'd received my order, and then a text when it was ready - which took only like 20 minutes? You pay when you pick it up so there's no chance of paying and then not receiving food or your order not having been processed. Also, I've been here a couple times now and the same guy's been at the counter each time, and he has a real friendly energy.   And the food is really good! I don't think this will be one of my buffet staples, but that's just b/c I'm a weird guy w/ really specific, esoteric preferences in dining rooms, and not at all a reflection on the quality of the restaurant itself.  Also, the pick-up/take-out order was packaged mostly with (potentially) reusable stuff - the three entrees were in reusable plastic containers (the same kind like, soup always comes in from East Asian takeout places) and the whole order was in a white paper gift bag instead of a plastic bag. The only un-reusable things were the foil the naan came in and the wrap around the papadum, and maybe the plastic containers with chutney. I don't fault any place for using disposable materials - I don't know a LOT about running a restaurant, but I know the profit margins are often really slim - but do like getting food in reusable containers/bags.",

If you're a wimp like me, this isn't the place for you.   Their chicken tikka masala was too spicy for me. And they used way too much cilantro. I can't tell you how many times I took a bite and I huge thing of cilantro. And I don't think the cilantro was cooked properly or something because it was too bulky and crunchy. Odd texture for a masala that is typically smooth and creamy.   Their fish tandoori had a good flavor but the spice hit me really quickly. I thought it was a bit over cooked and rubbery.   I don't think I'll be coming back here. The service was quick since it was a buffet and they were on spot with refills. It was cheap which was nice.

    "text": "I used to live in the 'arcadia lite' area. I regularly dined at Delhi Palace from 03'-09'. I credit the establishment to have played an instrumental role in opening my 'food mind'.  I began my journey at the buffet line, enjoying the typicals like chix saag, chix tikka, saag paneer, vindaloo, kheema mattar. I found the dishes so damn enjoyable, I never felt the need to stray too far from the basics, and generally ordered the same thing. I'm sorry to report after today's lunch visit, it appears that Delhi Palace has had some changes. I selected chix tikka, saag, and tandoori chix. Formally, I recall the chix tika masala as being- creamy, buttery, and the slightly sweet tomatoe flavor was always evident, all wraped up in a blend of delish indian spice. I recall stand out flavors being garam masala and curry. The consistency of the sauce was thick yet, pour-able. Today the lite creamy/buttery slightly sweet tomatoe flavor was absent. I tasted heavy smoke flavor, cayenne and the predominant spice i noted was salt. I would describe the sauce as paste. The flavor seemed...soooo concentrated. The saag, also very salty and spice flavor seemed concentrated..... I'm not sure what happened to the recipes  of yester-year, but it was dissapointing.",

I mean the carrots came out of either a can or a bag of frozen vegetables and everything is so bland.   The reason why Indian food is normally expensive is because the spices are expensive, and they spend time creating their dishes. Here, they're putting very little effort into their food with very little good ingredients and still charging the same that other places do.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. And do yourself another favor, scroll to the bottom of any Yelp review and click not recommended reviews. If you notice most of those reviews are from people who know what they're talking about. I'm not going to take advice from somebody who thinks Panda Express is real Chinese food.  Anyway it's not the worst thing I've ever eaten in my life but in terms of Indian food it's definitely at the bottom.",

This was my second visit to this establishment and the second visit topped the first. Why, you say?  The difference was defined by the a la carte experience as opposed to the buffet experience. Please note, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the buffet as it contained all the requisite flavors that make an Indian meal so delicious (although I did leave feeling like a stuffed turkey!).  However, at dinner, you can order exactly what you want off the menu, you can savor the precise flavors that you want. You can order garlic naan if you want. You can have a lamb vindaloo as spicy as you want. You can decide on chicken or lamb or shrimp or simply go vegetarian.   The decor here is typical of an Indian restaurant. The TV is set to play Indian songs, some of which you may recognize. The waiters are polite. The drinks are reasonably priced. Our overall dining experience was excellent. This place deserves a visit. We shall return.",

I feel robbed when I spend $50 on dinner for two people and probably $7 of that was their actual food cost, if that. Look at it this way... for $10 you get their lunch buffet that has naan, rice and an assortment of foods (all you can eat). But when you order food to go, they charge for every single item... $10 for each entry, $2.5 for naan, $3 for rice, etc. It adds up quick and all of that is at cheap cost for them, so their margins are huge!

The Indian Delhi Palace was absolutely scrumptious, and just as awesome, it was incredibly affordable.  The Samosas were perfectly sized and scrumptious.  I wish that they'd brought the tamarind sauce out before them with the chutney, but it did go perfectly with the samosa.  I got Malai Kofta.  Not exactly what I was expecting (it's my favorite dish), as it was a bit different than other places I've had it, but it was still delicious.  My partner got a good ol' favorite; Saag Paneer. It was a bit too spicy for her (her fault for ordering it medium), but we wound up mixing the two sauces together, and it was perfect. Portions were generous, especially given the affordable prices.  The service was so-so; our glasses stayed empty for some time before they got refills.  I wish I'd gotten a mango lassi, but it was a bit pricey, and we chose the Samosas instead. Also, I was a bit disappointed that the naan was sold separately, but I guess that's the way lots of places are going now.  All told, it was delicious, comforting and satisfying Indian food, and we were quite impressed! I can't wait to try their lunch buffet.",

My cousin who loves Indian food and was visiting from LA said it was the best Indian food she has ever had! The location is cool because they give you a taste of the Indian style and culture from the moment you enter the parking lot where the building has a palace shape and their is a cool looking mural on the large wall. The inside is pretty nice and the Indian cultural theme continued here with a homely feel because it is owned by one family it seemed. The chicken masala I ordered was impeccable and just my taste at a level 6 spiciness and the garlic naan was mouthwatering with the yogurt dipping sauce. The place is pretty nice but there's no need to overdress here. Best part was that they offered a 15% Yelp check in discount! Also, they have an attached spice shop if you are interested.",

    "text": "For the longest time I've always though this had a connection with the Delhi Palace in Tempe , which I think is mediocre, and so I didn't try this location. Finally found out it's not the same so I gave it a try.  Our group went for dinner so everything was ordered by entree. Best thing I tried was the lamb karahi (7/10 spice level) - perfectly cooked and soft meat and the sauce had a great texture with the tomatoes and bell pepper (sweet and satisfying spice level).   The chicken tikka masala (6/10 spice level) also hit the spot. I've only really full on enjoyed tikka masala from one other place and this comes pretty. The tomato base is perfect. The sauce is pureed and sifted until smooth. It was creamier than most chicken tikka masala but it does go well with their ingredients.  The butter chicken was alright. It was enjoyable but glad I shared it because I probably wouldn't have been satisfied if it was the only flavors I tasted.  Green and tamarind chutney are both great. Naan was soft and doughy. Rice was cooked to the right texture.   As far as spice level goes, I think 7 is very satisfying. It does build up as you eat but it's not too spicy in any mean. I would say once you get to an 8 it's closer to eating Serrano and would get that next time I come back.  Just wish the portions were bigger for the price point!",

We waited and waited and watched as a young man went to and fro in the dining area. Still no menus. He then began to clear a table of four who had just left  my husband and i asked each other whether it was more important to get  us menus or to clear off a table when no one was waiting for it.  I got up and went to the host at the entrance of the restaurant. He apologized and brought us ONE menu. He told us that they ran out of menus so we had to share one menu.   We were seated opposite each other so we took turns with the menu.  Then we had to flag down the waiter to place an order. Another wait.  I ordered the chicken vindaloo which has potatoes in it. Well the potatoes were raw. Enough that a fork could not go into them. The sauce was nicely spiced. We also ordered chicken biryani which was just ok but at least it wasn't greasy.  Basically this restaurant is in need of severe customer service intervention not to mention a few extra menus.",

The parathas were a bit bland and especially the Alok one was tasteless, the naans were of the same state.. and not to forget their curry didn't have salt. Overall it was not a pleasant experience at this place from start to the end.. we ordered a dessert - gajar ka Halwa which was plush and definitely won't return to this place again",

Spinach entree, lentil entree, mixed veggies & one more thing I cannot recall. The rice was crunchy and they only had 1 type of rice unlike other Indian buffets. The food wasn't very hot more just warm. Dessert: the Gulab jamun which is a favorite of mine was not good, hard and cold not warm and velvety in your mouth. I did like the other 2 desserts though a rice one and a carrot type dessert. I may forget the names of dishes but I'm a foodie who LOVES Indian food. Not very impressed w/anything so most likely won't return. Too many other restaurant options all throughout the valley.

Overall, everything tasted like dried-out, salty left-overs from the lunch buffet.  The service was also very poor with only one other table of guests in the restaurant.  Our drinks came at the end of the meal after finally getting a hold of our inattentive waiter.  I was here many years ago before they put all of their money into the building.  I guess none of their investment stayed in the quality of the food that I remember.  I sought this place out again while on my business trip, but now I regret it.",

The mixed grill was good, but the naan and the masala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by 'slap' I mean I may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful.

I would like to try some other entrees and the buffet before giving up on them but I won't order that entree again. Prices were pretty hefty for the portion received, especially considering that naan and rice are not included. That is a big pet peeve for me because there should be rice or bread the same as you receive a roll with an American dinner or chips and salsa with Mexican. Especially, when it is much more expensive. Why do so many Indian restaurants around here skimp on the bread and rice? Any restaurant that includes it will become my go to. The cost is minimal and cheaper than advertising. Word of mouth is what brings me to ethnic restaurants. Yelp is my reference quite frequently.",

This is a place that serves really good North Indian food, kind of Pakistani style, if you ask me, and it's really spicy and really good. They'll even give you chili peppers if you ask them to notch up the awesomeness even further.  This place has great service. Came here with my dad near closing time and they still seated us and let us order, even with only 15 minutes or so until closing. Food was hot and fresh even at the late hour. We were keeping the staff from closing up yet everyone was still extremely friendly and helpful, and of course we left a sweet tip.  The food here is amazing, anything you can point to on the menu is awesome and delivered fresh to your table. Now, I have never foot the bill myself, so of course I'm biased, but the prices seem reasonable to me, especially for a dinner for two or more.  I read in another review that the rice was crappy. No idea what that means and no, it's not free, grow up. Rice was somewhat dry but hey, it's rice, you eat it with something else.  Every time I've been here they have quickly seated my group. The waiters are prompt but not perpetually hanging around - fantastic service, although you *might* need to remind them for water once or twice. Food is extremely (OK, it can be extremely) spicy.",

But, as a reward for all of my cooking as of late, my husband took me out to dinner tonight.  I suggested we try Indian Delhi Palace, and he agreed!  We walked in and were immediately greeted by Nick, Mr. Delhi Palace's son.  Nick is a college student with one hell of a sense of humor.  The banter between him and Jared made for one comical meal.    Here's what we ate: -Garlic Naan -Peas Pulaou (Basmati Rice cooked with Peas) -Fresh Okra with Sliced Onions, gentle Herbs and mild Spices -Bengan Bhartha (Eggplant roasted in a delightful pulp, seasoned with Gentle Herbs and Mild Spices) -Shrimp Tikka Masala -Kheer (Basmati Rice Pudding sprinkled with almonds and Pistachio)  Everything was extremely tasty, especially the okra and shrimp dishes.  I normally do not like dishes that have onion in them, but pretty much everything we had contained a lot of it.  And actually, I still liked it!  The serving sizes were large, so we took home leftovers.  The price was a bit steep ($60 out the door), but we really enjoyed it.  I think this will be my new \"go-to\" place for Indian food, and my new \"go-to\" place for dinner when I pick up friends and family at the airport around dinner time.  As a side note, the Indian Delhi Palace building also has a large banquet room upstairs that Nick showed us upon our inquiry... it has a capacity of 250 and it's really nice.  Future Yelp event potential, perhaps?  We'll see about that.",

So often, things are forgotten, mispackaged and spilled and well, sometimes just tossed in a bag. Here they do it right. Garlic naan bread in house is better than to go. Unfortunately they wrap it in tinfoil and it sweats and loses any of it crispy outer crunch. Chicken tikka marsala has just enough cream and spice to hit all my F spots (you know like a G spot, only F for flavor!). Saffron rice is fluffy, flavorful and fantastic. Rickie loves their sauteed okra...generally not something high on my list to order but yowza Potsie...dee - lish. Samoras, tandori chicken all A's all around.

The place is modeled to look like a little taj mahal which is kinda goofy, but it's very nice inside and out. They have a delicious buffet for lunch with a menu that changes almost daily, unlike a lot of indian buffets where they have the same items for a week on the buffet line. The service is always good, even the first time I went I ordered chicken curry (I'd never had indian food) because it was a safe bet. The man asked me if I wanted an order of naan or rice and I didn't really want to order anything else. He said \"well how are you going to eat the curry? with a spoon?\" and brought me a basket of bread on the house. He knew I was trying something for the first time and wanted me to enjoy my experience. I've been back quite a few times and tried just about every other Indian place in town, and this one is still by far the best.",

I have a regular go to place for amazing flavorful food. Maybe one day I'll try it again but for now I'll stick to what I know.",

We complained to the management who tried to tell us it was cilantro. We told them we owned a restaurant and know what cilantro looks like and this was not it. It was black, with legs, clearly an insect of some sort. We took photos and videos of it because we felt it is our responsibility to warn people about this.   What made this experience even worse was that not only did they try to argue with us but they also didn't even seem to care it happened. They just said there was nothing they could do about it. We even offered to pay them for the soup just to show it wasn't about money, it was about food hygiene and service.   After tonight, we won't go back again.",

    "text": "Our normal Indian place was closed so we decided to try the next highest suggestion on Yelp. Unfortunately, we were let down.  We started with the assorted snacks. The single shish kabob was almost dried and the neat didn't taste very fresh. Papadum was supposed to be included in the snacks, but like other places we were given that when we sat down. It shouldn't be listed in the assorted snacks if they aren't going to give you more.   For dinner we ordered chicken tikki masala with garlic naan, as well as the goat masala from the \"chefs specialties\" portion of the menu. Being that this was a specialty you would think it would be pretty good. Unfortunately more than half of the chunks of \"meat\" were bone. The flavor was decent when you finally found a piece of meat.  The chicken tikki masala was not as flavorful as others I've had in the past and the meat was tough. Yes, tough chicken. The garlic naan was a a little too burnt too.  When if finally came time to get the check the server was ignoring us. We had the plates stacked and ready for clearing. He walked by multiple times before he finally seemed to notice we were ready. At which point he tried to force dessert on us. By the time the whole ordeal was over o was just glad I had cash on me so we didn't have to wait on him again.   If you're looking for great Indian food try Flavors of India a couple miles away. I won't be returning to Indian Dehli Palace",

This makes it a bit confusing as to which end to start at.  I started with some pakoa and mint chutney. The pakoa was the low point of my meal as it was oddly hard as if it were fried twice.  Moving on the the food at least the veg items. There was a Palak dish which had great spice as well as some cabbage dish that was miss labeled  and full of great flavor and textures I went back for more. The chana masala was also quite good spiked with many fresh veggies in sauce.   I am a big fan of their naan bread, it tasted as if it was made in a fire tandori, it really complemented the meal.

After 20 years, thought it was time to try again.  Found Indian Delhi Palace  on Yelp.  The reviews seem generally positive.  Dropped by on a Saturday evening to try it out.  The restaurant was about 2/3 full.  Two wait staff were also covering the reception station resulting in a low level frantic pace.  That is primarily the reason for not giving five stars.  Our waiter was quick and to the point.  I told him this was the first time to try Indian food.  He suggested the dinners that included a combination of dishes.  He asked how spicy on a scale of 10 we wanted.  I said about a 5.  He suggested maybe a 3 to start.  Probably was a good suggestion.  Not much time for questions before he was gone with our order.    The dinner included Indian milk tea (Chai) which I really enjoy at Starbucks anyway.  It had more spice flavor than the Starbucks concentrate version.  A nice improvement.  While a little picky, my cup of tea was spilled into the saucer.  Not sure why it was served that way.  I dribbled on the white table cloth every time I picked up the cup.  The tea was good though.  Questions about the food served were sort of answered.  The waiters were too busy to spend much time with amateur questions.  Guess I need to find an Indian to dine with next time.  Not really sure what I ate or the main ingredients in each item.  Everything tasted good.  Next time I will order individual items from the menu so I will know what I'm eating.    So, good food, will try again, but waiters were too busy to be of much help to Indian cuisine newbe's.",

    "text": "My wife and I (both vegetarians) stopped here at the end of the lunch buffet while traveling through Phoenix. It was a very pleasant surprise. The buffet was divided clearly into vegetarian and meat dishes. Vegetarian items were all familiar but some with unusual labels: saag paneer, \"vegetable fritters\" (pakora), \"yogurt curry\" (aloo korma), dal makhni. The spicing was very mild, as is customary on a buffet, but there were a variety of pickles, chutneys, and salads to create interest. I suspect that seasoning would have been higher on menu orders, but I have always liked to taste the actual ingredients as well as the spices, so I don't believe eating should be a macho competition to see who can make the spiciest food.  Staff were very friendly and pleasant. The buffet is $9.99 per person, so pretty inexpensive for lunch in Phoenix. The neighborhood is a little seedy, and the traffic leaving town (westward) from here was awful, even at 3PM.",

I was in Scottsdale area and by looking at the reviews I decided to go to Indian Delhi Palace.    Their food relative to other south asian restaurants I've been too was very mediocre. We ordered two dishes for dinner (Lamb & Chicken) and they tasted stale. The chicken curry was really salty and reheated from that day's lunch buffet. The lamb tasted so bad that I ended up not eating it. The naans however were good, but then again how can you mess up naan.  Overall I'd say this place has very whitewashed bland south asian food with no flavor. If you go to a lot of south asian restaurants and know what the food should taste like then do not visit this place.",

I literally could not eat a full meal because of how spicy this was. The mango lassi is water and mango flavoring mixed together not a trace of yogurt- in fact, when we came inside to pick it up (within 15 minutes) the lassi was completely settled and they had to go and prepare another batch! After preparing a \"fresh batch\" of mango powder and water they forgot to bring a straw and let us leave without one. I threw it out after a few sips. This was a waste of money, I do not recommend it. Steer clear.",

The service is very good, they are very nice and accommodating.   However, they are inconsistent with their spicy levels. I ordered a 10/10 once and didn't taste any spice and another time I ordered a 8/10 and it was extremely spicy and detracted from the taste of the curry.

I could over look that but there was a major problem  I attempted to pay the $49.78 bill via a $50 Debit Card I received for a test drive of a Lincoln. They ran that card 3 times claiming it was rejected and wanted another form of payment. I used my Amex Card for a total of $59.78--$49.78 + tip. After I arrived home, I checked the Debit Card and discovered the charge of $49.78 was listed as the card had a balance of $00.22. I called Delhi Palace back and they still claimed the Debit Card was rejected. They just spoke LOUDER that I was wrong. They refused to do anything about the double payment.  I told them that I would do a chargeback on my Amex Card and just completed that. I contacted the Debit Card Company for assistance on this double payment.  What could the Indian Delhi Palace have done to resolve this? Very easy--just check your income statement from the debit card and charge cards for that night. But all they did was to talk louder that the debit card was rejected.   I speak ENGLISH and I clearly understand what took place!  08/08/14 UPDATE  The debit card company sent me paperwork to file. There was information that my debit card was swiped 3 times and the purchase was APPROVED. Amex will be given a copy of this information.  Indian Delhi Palace needs a better customer service plan or this type of issue can take place again. Who's next?",

    "text": "I have received a few good reviews of Indian Delhi Palace, so I was extremely excited when I saw it was an option available on Uber Eats. I ordered chicken tikka masala, curry w/chicken (rice was not included with either entree and was an additional $3+ per side order), naan, and a side salad. When the order was delivered, the small portion sizes were immediately obvious and very underwhelming. At $13 per chicken entree, the maybe two cup size portion was extremely disappointing to say the least. We regularly order curry from another local popular restaurant at $11 per order and receive nearly double/more than double the amount we received in this order. The portion sizes and prices were extremely disappointing and unwarranted. The taste was decent, but not worth the cost. I will not be ordering food from here again.",

The quality and taste of the food are not great. The service is far from good. We were with a friend who is allergic to green bell peppers, so we specifically asked the waitress if the dish we were ordering contained any of them or was cooked with them, she said no. As we got out food thank God our friend didn't start eating it because we found a green pepper in there right away. Again, not coming back to this place and highly don't recommend it.",

    "text": "My first time at this restaurant was on a bad date.  I didn't drive at the time and since we were meeting at the restaurant, I took the bus and walked for about half an hour in the summer heat to get to the restaurant.  By then, my date had taken the liberty to order my meal.  The entree itself was a little pricey but scrumptious even with the terrible company.  (Might I add that he even asked if he could take my leftovers home.  Seriously, what?)  Anyway, since then I've been back way more times than I could count - with much better company.  Generally, I go for their weekend buffet which at $10ish per person, I say is a pretty damn good deal.  They don't have a huge spread for their buffet, but their items do not disappoint.  Their chicken tikka masala is by far my favorite item there, and goes perfect with the rice or the naan they bring to your table.  The fried vegetable fritters are amazing and I'm always a sucker for their desserts, especially these things that resemble donut holes but are drowned in syrup.  Oh and be forewarned (and this isn't at all a bad thing) that you might fall into a food coma after this buffet, so plan to get a cup of coffee or some other less sedentary activity so you don't immediately pass out the moment you reach home.  Trust me, I've fallen into that trap too many times, even when I thought I ate less than before.",

The flavor was decent, just not typical chicken tikka. The buffet was small but ok. The tandoori chicken was a bit dry.  The nan was great and fresh but they were slow in bringing more out.   Why is the Indian food in the greater Phoenix area so mediocre?    I'll probably be back since it's close to my work but I'm still looking for great Indian food in Phoenix area!",

We look forward to gorging on their delicious naan, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and rice. Those dishes are so good, wonderfully flavored and full of awesome. I love spinach, my sister hates it. Once I got her to try the palak panner she was hooked! Now we fight over who gets the last piece of cheese. Their chicken tikka is the best I've had. The chicken is flavorful and the sauce has a creamy and silky texture, perfect to dip your naan in. We've also had their butter chicken and chicken curry. Both were excellent. They also offer traditional Indian dinners (vegetarian and meat) which have a little bit of everything. They're great for introducing Indian food to first timers. Oh, and the mango lassi is delicious! Since everything is a la carte it can get pricey, but the portions are generous. I have yet to try their lunch buffet.  It has a really nice atmosphere and is never overly crowded so you can have a nice conversation. The decor is also lovely. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have a small market attached full of spices, medicines, bangles, hena kits and other various food items.  Really great restaurant!",

    "text": "My husband is the fan of Indian food, and I had a gift certificate from some students, so we gave Indian Delhi Palace a try.  The service was spotty, depending on who was in our section at the time.  The naan and puri were excellent, and both of our entrees were tasty (my husband had the chicken tikka masala and I had a mild lamb dish in cream sauce. The jasmine rice was beautiful and well cooked, but also had cardamom seeds in it (not my favorite). My husband loved his palak paneer. We agreed that overall, we have had a little better food and service from Taste of India.",
