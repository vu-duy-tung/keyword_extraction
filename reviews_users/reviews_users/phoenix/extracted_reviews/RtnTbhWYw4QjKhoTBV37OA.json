    "text": "So I LOVE Beer! But this place (which I've never been to) is now the Mecca for beer. Not only is their beer menu 5 pages long it's categorized by: Type, size and ABV   I tend to err on the side of super dark stouts and IPA's so tonight I had the Dogfish 60min IPA and Odell Mercenary IPA.   Both were amazing! The Odell was strong, like an IPA should be - granted it was surprisingly light in color but definitely my favorite at 9% ABV   I paired it with the BBQ Cheddar Burger which was cooked to perfection (Medium-Well.) It came with a garlic aolie spread and rum BBQ sauce, which was tangy and sweet.   My wife had the lobster and shrimp pasta which was equally as good!   From now on if I'm ever in a town that has a Yardhouse, I will be giving them my business-no questions asked!",

I ordered the lobster artichoke dip I would say it was nasty but i couldn't taste anything! No crab no lobster no artichoke it was tasteless with chunks of cream cheese at the bottom. My husband ordered the crab cakes the sauce was amazing but the crab cakes were overdone and tasted like my moms salmon croquet patties. The spicy shrimp jambalaya was also tasteless with big chunks of red and green bell peppers that was very crunchy. My husband said his burger was average. I would say you get what you pay for but Forget that I spent $80 bucks on trash should've listened to my husband and went to Flavors of Louisiana. This place is trash!",

They have a ton of great beers on tap and a wide variety of foods.  This time I got the chicken nachos which are great and more than enough for two people to share.  I also ordered a moose drool brown ale but the server accidentally brought out some porter.  I was disappointed the server didn't do more (other than apologize) to make the situation right but the porter was actually pretty good so I can't complain too much.  Their BBQ burger is one of the best burgers you will ever have and I highly recommend it as well.  The only thing I've ever had at yard house that I didn't like was the macaroni and cheese which is crazy because I love mac and cheese.  If you are looking for a semi-casual place that has great food and beers, you can't beat yard house.  Just pay attention to prices because you can rack up a huge bill if you aren't careful.",

The atmosphere is good but it is confused to whether it's a bar or a higher end nice place out. I felt more as though it's like Applebees, a little nicer but way more expensive. We definitely won't go out of our way to come here, but I am open to going back if I'm in the area. It used to be one of our favorite places but with the price spike it's just not worth it.",

Service was quick and friendly and the outdoor area is super comfortable.  I especially love the outdoor lounge seating, not just tables.  It's nice when you're just grabbing some drinks with friends to not have to sit at a dining table.  The beer selection is amazing, but so is the rest of the menu.  Also they have an entire vegetarian section of the menu now which is great, my only complaint (which is a preference thing more then anything) is that I wish they didn't all contain Gardin products, I wish a few of those items were just veggie items.  But you can also find meatless options in other portions of the menu.",

This dip fits the standard and is served with crispy pita-esque bread pieces.   I truly appreciate the large selection of Gardein entrees they serve for Vegetarians and Vegans that want to enjoy not-so- healthy bar grub like our omni friends. ** Be sure to note any dietary restrictions upon placing your order. I ordered the \"beef\" sliders original style and they came with cheese which was not mentioned on the menu. They gladly added a side of lettuce and the jerk and buffalo sauces to my plate. I adore there shoe string fries.   My companions enjoyed their ahi tuna salad and steak entrees.   As far as drinks go, there is a large menu sure to please everyone in your party!",

My food was perfect (oredered a pizza). One member of our party ordered medium steak that arrived cold and extremely rare. They took it back and cooked the same steak a little more, and put it back on the same plate and brought it back out. We were about all done eating when she got her steak back. Bummer.  Three of us (party of 7) had to go to the bathroom on the way home from the meal...they must use some ingredients that we aren't use to eating.",

YH has the best happy hour menu anywhere around, their appetizers are super affordable, you can tell me: \"but its $5+ an appetizer due\" and i will tell you \"their regular prices are $10-$12 dude\" they don't skimp on portions, you could have a full meal on their apps. Their sliders are pretty good, but about $8, not a problem for the price, 4 sliders and fries, enough for two. My Favorites: Spicy Tuna Roll(not your sushi cut rolls), and their barnaise sliders.   Their drinks: its an infinite list, seems like never ending on how many drinks they have, they have so many beers that you will never finish trying them all. you try their limited seasonal and everytime you come you get the same because your in love with it.   Staff: is super friendly and knowledgeable, tell them what you're in the mood for and they will recommend something for you.  Hint: you could try up to 3 small samples of beer at no charge!!!  *If you have kids dont worry you could bring them. YH is not a bar where people get out of control. *",

    "text": "The best surprise in Phoenix this summer, other than my nice new job, was the discovery of the Yard House's expansive beer selection, delicious food, and friendly service.  Last week a bunch of us came here to try it out, mostly because there wasn't anything else around that sounded good. I arrived late and opted for a wheat-and-banana draft beer and chicken strips and fries, a nice staple. The server took my late order in stride and had it out in what seemed like a few minutes. The beer was delightful, the chicken strips flavorful and fresh, the truffle fries crispy and tasty. I walked out for just over $20 very satisfied.  Tonight we went back, a smaller group than before. Once again I arrived a little late (do we sense a theme here?) and once again the server made it work and got us all seated and ordering. He made some great menu suggestions for our little group and gave us enough time to decide without wasting time. I landed on a grilled pastrami with pickled jalapenos that had a nice zing to it and sweet potato fries that were as light and crispy as any I've ever had, and moreso than most. The rest of our little band's food looked beautiful and tasted great, from the round of drinks that started us off to the last-minute dessert of creme brulee.  One minor disappointment - I suspect that the Yard House would make a fine Reuben sandwich, but not finding one on the menu surprised me. I would have liked to try their take on a Reuben, one of my personal benchmarks for a good bar-and-grill. Sadly, the grilled pastrami is the closest they have to it.  Even so, the Yard House's extensive beer selection, unique menu, and reasonable prices make it a place worth visiting more than once. Maybe next time they'll have that Reuben for me.",

I also drank a salted watermelon Margarita which is the best margarita I've ever had. The service was incredible!",

I'm in the service industry and very forgiving to simple mistakes, except when I can tell that no one cared to make sure simple requests were met. Server was not coursed on his menu items as he told us pickles were on the side of the Cuban sandwich already, when they came on it. Asked for tomatoes and mustard on the side. No mustard, tomatoes and pickles on sandwich. Aunt asked for no blu cheese on her grilled cheese, sandwich came out with no cheese at all?? It's better to ask a couple more questions as a server if you're confused than to just not care at all. Also, if the server did put the order in correctly, why did the food runner not care to check the food they took to the table? Manager came to the table and gave a robotic response to the mistake, wasn't even given a itemized bill until asked for one. Poor execution of service. For all I've heard about how \"hard\" it is to work there even, I was thoroughly unimpressed with what the place offers for an easy going table. Lost good tippers for your staff tonight. Enough is enough.  Also, every beer delivered to my table was DEAD. I know what craft beer is supposed to look like, yard house isn't doing a good job of delivering quality beer with good head.",

They have a wide variety of beers on top, a solid wine list and obviously cocktails since it is a full bar. They have a range of foods from classic American burgers to poke and have good vegetarian menu options. I have had the vegan burger here 3 times now and would definitively recommend it.",

Our favorite time to go is for happy hour and sit at the bar. Although that is always a busy time and finding a seat can be challenging. If you are not going during happy hour, I'd say you are going to pay about $15 per meal on average.   I have had inconsistent service here. Sometimes it's great, and at others, it lacks, but it always a good stop if you are in the Westgate area.",

Lots of good selections of craft beer and typical bud coors type stuff, if you're into that. Bartenders know their stuff and considering the amount of beers they try to remember, I gotta give credit to them.   So the location for this one is at westgate and on a weekend or game day I would say this is the only place I would be stopping in for a beer. Try the western bbq burger, really good smoked bacon and their own bbq sauce was a good touch. Good place to go",

    "text": "I love the Yard House!  Until I moved to PHX, I can honestly say that I was a total anti craft beer snob.  I always felt as if drinking a craft beer would magically transport you to Hipsterville and I'd be forced to listen to obscure music while riding a tricked out bicycle wearing a beanie hat in the desert.  Well guess what, people?  It doesn't happen!  Rejoice knowing that craft beer is DELICIOUS and won't make you a pretentious snob. ;) The restaurant is always packed and for good reason.  Their food is awesome, and ranges from salads to burgers to steak and everything else in between.  I've tried many options on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The staff is well versed in their offerings and will be more than happy to provide you a recommendation on their tasty food.  I also like the open air kitchen...if you don't want to watch sports on their seemingly endless number of televisions, you can watch the chefs hustle throughout the kitchen working their magic. Beer?  They've got it.  The beer menu is just as long as the food menu and doesn't disappoint.  They've done less saavy drinkers such as myself a solid and broken down the beers into types and flavors.  For instance, if you're looking for a fruity ale, just go to the fruit beer section.  It makes selecting a drink you're bound to love a breeze.  My two favorites are Four Peak's Peach Ale and San Tan's Mr. Pineapple.  You've just gotta try those if you like fruity beer like I do.  Mucho delicioso!   The Yard House also has a pretty solid Happy Hour with deals on drinks and food.  The clientele ranges from kiddos to businessmen and has a fun, lively vibe.  Definitely check the Yard House out if you want good food, good drinks, and fun.",

Then my kids fries did not come in with there meal. They had to wait a extra 10 to 15 minutes for the fries and by then there food was cold. I ordered my burger medium rare and came in over well done. With past experience at the Yard House ( Chino Hills and Irvine Ca.) I always had good service but not this time. It takes a lot for me to write a negative review. But it's the truth. The place was clean and friendly service.",

I get a half Turkey club and the best Cesar salad I have ever had anywhere. They also have an option for soup too... however I can't every seem to turn my back in that Cesar salad lol.   The wait staff are always pleasant and usually on point. I did have one waitress when I was there about a month ago who was very disinterested and because of that she messed up our order.   They have many tv's up around the place and on Sundays they have several different football games showing.   The only downside is twice we have had to wait to be seated even though there were clearly tables available.   Overall I give four stars because even having to unnecessarily wait, the food is always worth it because the food is THAT good.",

    "text": "We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend as we were in town on business.  Location & Aesthetics - Located in Glendale off the 101 highway on W. Coyote Blvd.  The restaurant is nestled among other restaurants and there's plenty of signs for it.  You can dine inside or outside if you desire.  If dining outside, there's mister's when it's hot outside.   There's lots of parking but it's not close to the restaurant.  There's small streets between the various restaurants and whatever parking spots they have usually full up quickly.  The restaurant is large and immediately when entering, you're not only greeted by staff but in front of you are large screened TV's and a huge center bar with plenty of lights. The place can get a bit noisy as we found it but it wasn't bad that we couldn't hear each other.  Menu - Their menu is large and can be intimidating as the first couple pages is reserved for their large variety of beer.  Seeing as we were new in town, we just wanted to try a softer drink and had to ask the waiter where those can be found on the menu.  The rest of the menu is straightforward and clear.    Service - The staff was very friendly!  Food - I ordered the ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The beans tasted as they were just picked and they were verdantly green and crunchy and lighted buttered.  The mashed potatoes was equally tasty and delicious.  The ribeye was done just the way I asked and was soft, tender, well seasoned, and juicy.  I did however find that the food portions were on the small side (-1)  Rating - 4/5.  Definitely will worth coming back for the ambiance, atmosphere, their large variety of beer, and to try other items on the menu!",

I can honestly say the staff here is top notch along with the service. Oh yeah! You can order or substitute Gardein in everything! Try gardein nachos and/or gardein lettuce wraps! You will love it :)",

    "text": "Two stars for me.  Stopped by for lunch and had a single baja fish taco and the pepper jack burger.  The tortilla for the taco was too thick and there was a single small dollop of guacamole in the middle.  The burger was smallish and no better than what I've had at a Ruby Tuesday's or Applebee's.  Bun seemed a bit stale.  Was expecting better based on the reviews.  Fries were the shoestring type and I've never been a fan (can't recall if the menu stated they were or not).  May give it another shot for dinner and see if it turns out better but lunch was pretty disappointing.  Should have gone to In n Out Burger.    Will say it is in a nice location.  Beer selection is good.  Much better than you'll find in most chains.",

    "text": "My 1st visit to the Yardhouse was exceptional. Sorry for the long post but I took it from my FB I made about both the Yardhouse and Saddle Ranch at Westgate  I wanted to share my two great customer service experiences I had when I went out last night. We started with dinner at Yard House - Glendale after we placed our order my friends food arrived quickly but my mac-n-cheese was taking a little longer. No big deal we weren't in a rush. The waitress checked on us again a 5 or 10mins later still no mac-n-cheese. Turns out the order wasn't placed because the printer cut it off the slip. The manager was very apologetic and took it off our bill. We didn't ask her to so the gesture was very much appreciated.    After dinner we walked over to Saddle Ranch for a drink grabbed a table on the patio and waited for our waitress and waited and waited and waited. A manager was a couple of tables away working on schedules so I asked her if we needed to go in to the bar to order (we had seen a server pass by a few times) She said absolutely not called someone on her headset and a security guard came by to check on us and took our drink order. He continued to check on us the entire time we were there and informed us the general manager took care of our drinks. When we left I got back to my car and realized I had left my iPhone on the table. I quickly drove around, rushed back to the table (the entire time thinking the worst) only to find it not there. I stopped the waitress and she said the security guy that had been helping us had it. WHEW!! So relieved! In a culture of get em' in get em' out to make more money Thank You Yard House and Saddle Ranch for providing excellent customer service!",

We started with the Calamari. Delish! Then the hubby and I ordered the Classic Cheeseburger because we believe this is the best cheeseburger we have ever had! I order mine medium and he orders his rare. We were so excited to get our food because we were so hungry. The food took a bit longer but knew it would be worth the wait. Well... food came and we dug in. The hubby got 2 bites into the burger before we realized it was cooked medium well. We decided to talk to the manager because the burger is about $12 and we wanted it cooked RIGHT. The 2nd one came out quickly and he bit into it... PEOPLE... THE DAMN BURGER WAS RAW. R-A-W! It was so flippin nasty. The hubby pulled the hamburger apart and it was, no joke, just raw ass hamburger!  I was about half way through my burger and after seeing THAT, I just wanted to puke.   I will say, yardhouse (Desert Ridge) has never done us wrong, ever! We will go back but we might stick with Desert Ridge.",

My drink of choice was the Raspberry Cider, and for my meal I decided on the Spicy Chicken Breast sandwich with fries. The sandwich was a nice thought but it had some flaws - the flat bread was good, but too thick/fluffy to handle all of the insides. Also, the seasoning on the chicken was more salty than spicy. Either way I was starving so I sucked it up and ate most of it. The service was good and they have heaters on the patio which was nice.",

Seeing as the lighting was too dim to even see the plate. My date's steak has so much fat he had to re-carve the darn thing with each and every bite. He left more than half on the plate. The steak I ordered was old, not aged. I had sat in the cooler far too long. The edges were cooked well but the inside of the meat was gritty and worse than burnt meat. The tomato garnish was so bitter and sour it turned my stomach. The iced tea was weak. The potatoes were edible compared to the steaks. The music was good.",

I dont know if this place has rested on its name but just because its known doesn't mean it can treat people like crapm the food is expensive and service should be top notch. Not too mention today was $3 pints which was a selling point at sitting at our table and we were charged full price. If we hadn't notice we would have been vharge extra. The staff knows and should be in the system but we had to tell them. Unacceptable for such a level to be this low in service.",

I have been here countless times because of that sandwich. Today, i sat down and noticed that on their menu it was gone.. i am extremely devastated. I have to say I have tried other things on their menu and it was all not up to par. Unless they come back with that entree I am sad to say they lost my business... Yardhouse, please contact me if you decide to bring the Steak sandwich back. Thank you ...",

Which, we didn't know until we decided we got too full off of the appetizer (nachos are HUGE), and wanted the mains to go. The manager Chris came over to apologize about the pork loin not being available, and for our 'inconvenience', he even comped the nachos! We really didn't mind not having it available, but he went out of his way to be so generous. Just wanted to say we appreciate the great customer service. Our servers Chelsea and Austin were both amazing also, despite it being really busy.",

We ordered fish tacos, cauliflower \"wings\" with a spicy tahini sauce, brussels sprouts and potatoes with a sauce (not sure, seemed mayo/ketchup based), sweet potato fries, a kids grilled cheese, and a side of tomato soup.  After a rough start to the service, it improved during the meal with refilling drinks in a timely manner.  The food was really good, the family liked all the dishes. The brussels sprouts were cooked nicely, good texture, yet tender, may have been fried as the potatoes were.  We asked for the tomato soup to be brought with the rest of the food, not before, so it can be eaten with the grilled cheese. So the soup ends up coming out first.  We waited, hoping the rest of the food would come right after.  After 15-20 miutes, the food came, noticed the soup wasnt eaten. he offered to have a fresh, hot bowl brought out to correct the issue. We enjoyed our time and would be back next time we are in the Westgate area.",

However, my experience at this particular Yardhouse location paled in comparison to the other two locations I've been to in Tucson (yes this place was worse than being in Tucson) and Scottsdale. The first thing I noticed was that the restaurant had an unpleasant smell to it and that the floors were very, very slick inside the restaurant. Service was poor from wait times to customer service, and the food quality and preparation just did not feel like it compared to previous visits. Our waiter was rude and awkward and even had the nerve to make a comment to us that we should enjoy a free drink that the bar had mistakenly poured wrong not once, but twice.   Update: I was contacted by Yard House, and they expressed their concern regarding my experience which is greatly appreciated. I will be going back to Yard House, but likely a different location.",

Been meaning to check out a Yard House ever since Josh A's glowing endorsement on the Talk boards awhile back.  102 tap beers sounded right up my alley.  Didn't think I had ever been to one before, but it was pointed out to me that I was at one in San Diego in the Gaslamp Quarter a couple years ago.  Remember really having liked it.  Probably would have gone 4 or 5.  Low 3 on today's visit.  The music was blaring loud this evening.  I'm sorry, but Matchbox 20 was not meant to be played that loud.  They are not even that good as background music.  I thought the waitress was going to kiss my mother on the lips as she was leaning in so close to hear the order.  Do they really think people like the music that loud?  Most of the customers were either parents with kids or gray-haired snowbirds.  No one was rocking out to it.   Had two Uinta Hop Notch's which I have never seen anywhere else before.  Quite tasty.  The menu is very extensive both on beer and food.  Got the Mediterranean flatbread as an appetizer.  It was not good.  No sauce whatsoever, just toppings on crust.  Would have also been much better if the tomatoes were sun dried.  Would not get it again.  The blackened swordfish tacos were pretty good.  Little light on the fish, but excellent flavor with a healthy dose of guacamole.  I would definitely get these again.  Also had a couple bites of the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Think I will get that the next time I go when they open at West End in St. Louis Park.  Hopefully, they will use the volume dial on the music more prudently.",

Finally a manager, named Aaron, comes out and says my mom cannot have her toy Pomeranian on the patio. That is completely understandable however this dog has been a service animal for nearly 3 years. When she expressed this to him he actually, physically rolled his eyes (which blows me away) and said \"oh really? Do you have papers for him\"? The fact that the manager of this establishment felt comfortable being so blatantly rude especially after we had been sitting 10 minutes without acknowledgment blows me away. It is illegal for a restaurant to request service papers with private medical information on it and had he not have been so rude then we wouldn't be filing an official report on the restaurant about it. Such a shame because I love the other Yard House locations.",

I was standing next to my assistant when she called to make the reservation and also when she called back to confirm the reservation. When I arrived the person at the desk said there wasn't a reservation. With the line I expected a long wait, which was especially frustrating because people drove over an hour to arrive for a very important meeting.  The staff was able to seat us relatively quickly. We ordered appetizers, both of which I would say were pretty good. I ordered a Caesar salad and a burger. The Caesar salad was a bit above average but I'd have to say the burger was below average. I've had the same one (pepper crusted Gorgonzola) at other Yardhouse locations and they were great but this one just seemed a little off. Also, one of our members of the party started to have an allergic reaction to the food he ordered which is never pleasant for anyone, thankfully it was relatively mild. Maybe it was just a bad night since I've had some great food from this chain at other locations. At least I hope that was the case.",

The service is always slow no matter what day, what time, what year.  The food is mediocre to decent but over priced and the service is anywhere from poor to horrendous.  We recently went and ordered 2 soups, 2 apps, and 1 kids meal.  We literally waited over 30 minutes for anything to arrive.  We are talking the most basic items on the menu here folks and the place was half empty when we walked in.    When it finally did arrive, by someone other than our long gone waitress, the onion rings were burnt and already cold, the soups had a layer of film on top which indicates they were sitting out for quite some time, and the french fries were cold.  I'm not sure if they planned this but we were so hungry from waiting we just ate the bullshit they served us.    I asked for our check and waited and waited while our waitress Hillary stops at random tables that she is not even attending.  She finally brings us our check, drops it and runs away without taking it back even though my card has been out on the table for a good 15 minutes. She finally comes back and takes it.  Again she stops at random table after random table while I sit and wait and wait.  I felt like I was being held hostage by Isis.       I am pretty sure I just survived my first hostage crisis.  Bottom line: Yardhouse sucks, Westgate is bunk, and the outlets are whack.  I hope I never come back anywhere near here again other than for a Cardinals game.  I swear this side of town can't have anything good.",

Our server, Clint, was understanding, kind, brilliant and very helpful.  I had the Avocado & Swiss burger, minus the Swiss and the Garlic Aioli (made with eggs). I ordered the hummus w pita and smeared that all over my burger. It was fantastic.  Our food took a ridiculous amount of time to get there, but I'm sure it was just a mix up and I don't hold it against anyone. The place was MAD BUSY on a Saturday night during a Coyote's game but we were seated in about 3 minutes.  People around us were getting their food on time. Probably just a fluke :) The people watching was great and the time really flew by. Their draft beer selection was fab! I had an IPA the name escapes me. Green something.",

They were busy, yes, but it's a weekend so they should expect to be busy!  I also thought the portions were small for the prices.

No matter the location, I can always count on delicious food and great service.  With such a large menu, it really is a wonder that they can get it right every time... and I was feeling particularly hungry after an arctic Coyotes-Hawks game.    Truffle Fries= heaven in my mouth.  Topped with parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, this \"Snack\" item was definitely worth the calories.  Regular fries will never live up to their full potential again.  On the appetizer menu, the Coconut Shrimp is a winner.  Four very generously sized butterfly shrimp are battered and fried to perfection atop a bed of shaved carrots, papayas, and cilantro.. give me a second while I wipe the drool off my keyboard please.  Mac and Cheese Squared is a personal AND House Favorite for good reason: cheesy noodles cooked in truffle oil with wild mushrooms, applewood bacon, and chicken breast.  Definitely a staple menu item.  The burgers are great, happy hour menu is awesome in forward and reverse, and did I mention that the selection of draught beer wraps around the bar? Thanks for being consistently awesome Yard House!",

Unfortunately, no amount of beer can ever make up for such a crappy dining experience.  Waiter kept touching all of us in that overly friendly/concerned relative sort of way.  Food not cooked properly.  Food dropped by wait staff.  Manager bait and switch.  Not fixing the bill.  So bad I considered a dine and dash.  Decided to bitch to corporate and cancel my card transaction instead.  Beware, chains don't give a crap about the customer!  I will remember to spend my money at small private restaurants with good health ratings.  ...By way of follow up.  Corporate did contact me.  Through Yelp only as their complaint section of their website does not work.  Good luck if you have a bad experience there. ------- June 17th follow up:  Decided to finally give them a second try.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  The experience may have actually been worse.  Just skip this place and go spend your money at one of the 10 other places nearby.  Big deal they have the hockey game on.  Bet that if you asked the bartender at Gordon Biersch to change the channel the would.  Also, at least they know what is going on over there.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to The Yard House yesterday at Westgate. We were trying to catch a movie and should have had ample time to eat and have a beer before (an hour and a half) especially when the restaurant was 3/4 empty in the late afternoon. When we arrived and were seated we noticed that it was quite hot inside. The waiter told us the air-conditioning was on fritz. Really? This is Arizona in the summer. It was literally 120 degrees outside, and they couldn't call the AC repair guy? Our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and honestly the only saving grace of our experience. We ordered our beers (they do have an AWESOME selection) and I ordered a salad, and my husband a sandwich. The beers came quickly, but the food took over an hour. Let me just reiterate that the restaurant was basically empty and we ordered a salad and a sandwich. We ended up missing our movie (by a half hour) and left hot and sweaty.  The ambiance would be enjoyable if they fixed their A/C unit. The menu is presented as New American and definitely tries to give an heir of class, but it is really just average diner food. My salad was pre-chopped bagged lettuce with bottled dressing. My husbands sandwich was on sliced white bread. Definitely not great. We certainly won't eat here again, and won't be going back for beers either unless they get their A/C in working order. I just feel bad for those poor servers who were stuck working in long sleeved uniforms in the sweatbox.",

For our snacks/appetizers we ordered hot wings and truffle fries. The wings and fries were great, our main course however wasn't. The bun used for the burgers looked like they were bought from a grocery store. The kind you buy for 99 cents. It wasn't toasted. I ordered the pepper crusted gorgonzola. It was suppose to have caramelized onions but believe me, they weren't. Simply sweated down and placed on a bun. My hamburger was certainly pepper crusted but it was not seasoned properly. The dish was missing salt, none on the hamburger or the fries. The choice of bun, with not being toasted and mushrooms, greasy onions and cheese made the bread soggy. I ate only the fries. We ordered dessert and got the mini trio. This place loves it's mini concept. The apple peach cobbler was delicious but the chocolate souffle cake was very bitter and the lemon souffle cake was liquified. It seems like they made the recipe for mug cake and not a souffle. I gave my review 2 stars because of the apple peach cobbler, the fries, hot wings and beer. The St Bernardus was awesome!",

We ordered their massive chicken nachoes which were really dried out-glad they had lots of guacamole to go with it. The onion tower was amazing as always. The sliders were good but the fries were cold. My husband also got the boneless wings which had great flavor but were cold.

    "text": "Dear Corporate Yardhouse:  How Do I begin? Well, lets start from the beginning.  My name is Kirpal and I am from the Pacific North West and have been an avid Seattle Seahawks fan for some years now. I currently live in Dallas where I have my current job as a General Dentist.  I decided to take time off work and visit Glendale, Arizona for the Superbowl XLIX game on Feb 1st and paid nearly $1000 for my return flight, $300/night for hotel and then waited patiently since 8am at your Yardhouse location so that we could get a table for our group of 20!  As 10am approached we were seated to our table and enjoyed all the festivities that occurred before the big game and enjoyed the Wings, and a Burger. I decided right then and there since we had a large group that I would pay for my items directly as I received them so not to confuse anyone once everyone is ready to leave. I made my first purchase on my credit card, which included a Stone IPA, burger and wings. My following orders, which were also Stone IPA, were all paid in cash.  My waitress was very good about bringing the bill directly to me after each pint, which was around $8 and I would give her $10 including tip every time. The waitresses changed throughout the afternoon but they all understood I was paying as I was being served for all my beverages.  As there was about 1 final minute left in the game, which I took time off of work to watch and spent a lot of money on flights and hotels to be with my friends for this FINAL moment of the game, the manger of this Glendale Arizona Yardhouse, Felicia Gilletti approached me.   While I'm trying to watch this final play she has this bill in a black pleather holder about 4 inches from my face and sternly says \"You have this bill to pay!\" I was so shocked not about the bill at first but more so that she was shoving this piece of fabric  nearly 4 inches into my personal space and accusing me that I have to pay a bill which I know that does not exist since I have been paying for every drink as it came in cash! I explained to her that I had paid my first order on credit card and subsequent orders in cash and that she can go ahead and verify my card. I showed her my card which had my name, Dr................ on it. Her response was \"Your not a real doctor because a doctor would pay his bill!\" At this point my shock had still not waived off and I wasn't sure if I was more shocked about her shoving a piece of pleather 4 inches from my face, or her first accusation, or her blunt insult.  At this point I really wanted to get back and watch the game and paid the $40 that was claimed on the bill even though I also told her she was mistaken for the bill as I had been paying cash and I believe it was one of my other friends' bill who also was drinking the same brand of beer sitting across from me. I also told her that it was very rude of her to shove something like that in my face without even considering my personal space. And finally I told her it was very unprofessional of her to insult me even when I asked her to verify my credit card for my earlier bill and she could also verify with the many waitresses that my patronage was in good standing. Her response was that I would be getting kicked out soon as she collected my  $40. She immediately called security and I paid a bill that not only was mine but also ruined a special moment lost in the final minute of the game with my closest friends after waiting in hours in line!  Thanks Yardhouse for terrific customer service!  Unsatisfied customer,   I have written a letter to the Corporate office and my whole table who witnessed this abuse will also be writing letters to the main office and also will be leaving reviews here on Yelp! I will not be back as long as Felicia Gilletti is their Manager, as she is a poor reflection of Yardhouse's  exceptional customer service! She was extremely  insulting, rude, and very unprofessional in the way she handled the situation. I spent nearly $100 myself during the Superbowl game and she ruined it with her ignorance!    I look forward to hearing how this establishment will respond to this horrendous experience!  Sincerely,  Kirpal  As expected! Corporate got back to me and basically took their stupid managers side and claimed I was in the wrong. THEIR MANAGEMENT IS HORRIBLE AT THIS LOCATION! This franchise will not collect a single dollar from me or my family again!",

I tried for a 5:00 reservation but nothing was available.  I asked him what was the next available time was after 5:00.  He said for a party our size (11 people) he could do 6:00 and put it down.  I confirmed before hanging up party of 11 for 6:00.  He said yes.  We show up at 5:45 and our reservation is not down and the restaurant is packed with a wait time of 50 minutes for a table.  We have 5 kids with us, no way we can wait 50 minutes, hense the reason for my reservation.  Tim was still there so I asked to speak to him.  He tried saying he told me to get there 45 minutes before our reservation time and there is nothing he could do.  He never said that.  Plus thats what reservations are for so you don't have to get there 45 minutes before.  If my experience was just dealing with Tim this restaurant would get zero stars.  He was awful.  I asked to speak with someone higher up.  I normally would just  give up at this point but because we had family fly in from 3000 miles away we wanted them to eat there since thats where they wanted to try.  Anyway, the GM Jeri came out and spoke w me.  I explained to her our situation and she was very understanding and apologetic.  There was a party of 18 just closing out and she said she would clean that table off for us.  Not only did the GM of the restaurant personally clean our table off she gave us a free round of drinks while we waited.  That would have been enough to compensate.  When the waiter came over he said appetizers were on the house too.  We could not have been more happy with the way the situation was handled.  Jeri was great and because of her we will be returning.  I will just make sure Tim is not the manager taking my reservation.  Not sure how he became a manager of a restaurant like this.",

Had the Pastrami sandwich and Tomato Bisque, Our table also ordered the Ahi Salad and the vegetarian chicken salad along with edamame and truffle oil fries off the \"snack\" menu  all was very good.  I thought it was a bit pricey, lunch for 2 without alcohol was $35.00 (2 items off the cheaper appetizer \"snack\" menu also\" They ahve what is probably over 50 beers on tap if your a beer drinkers this place would be a good stop....I saw their Martinis were $10 each....Ouch.",

OMG...yep he was right!!!  We got hummus to start with.  First of all....this was the BEST hummus I have ever had.  It was so good.  I want some right now and I would have to buy a plane ticket and fly for four hours just to get it.  BIG BUMMER!!!  For my lunch I got the greek salad and it was amazing.  It was very light and refreshing.  Just what I was wanting.    Not only was the food great but my drink was so good!  I got the Rose Garden which was Hoegaarden White and Lindeman's Framboise.  I'm going to have to find something close to this here because I have to drink this during the summer.    I got a taste of the Ahi tuna sandwich and it was delicious too.  I'm pretty sure that you won't be disappointed with anything here.  I know I'm in love and have a place I have to go to when I'm in Phoenix!",

Their creme brulee is always great too, but not on the HH price. Awesome music, clientele and environment. I am very much liking the \"Westgate\" area. Excellent customer service from both Jamie/Waitress and one of the Managers/Mike. Happy New Years! :)",

The night we had dinner here, we ordered shrimp off the appetizer menu -- which was \"good\" -- but definitely expensive for what you get.  Three pieces of shrimp (sure they are large, but shrimp only gets so big ;) - for $12.95 -- yikes!!  Sweet potato fries were good, but arrived on the cold side.  We ate dinner outside -- great ambiance, and a beautiful Arizona summer night.  Our waitress was friendly, service was fairly fast.  Overall a good expereince.  Prices just a bit too high on some of the selections.",

One mistake the tall black dude behind the bar is so mean, hateful and rude towards me every time I go in here and ignores when I am wanting a drink like he has a personality conflict with me and I use to come in here  a lot. Then when I ordered food,  they brought me my food all old, cold, and hard. Dispicable. Middle finger up to this horrible place. I am sick of this place mistreating me by f******* up my food, service, and not staying on top of making sure I have my drink. Didn't even offer me a water.  The black dude and white dude with black glasses were very arrogant, rude, and lied to my friend about what he ordered and told him he couldn't order what he wanted. So he ordered something else and he was not too impressed with his gum tasting ass steak.  The rude short arrogant white dude with black glasses. He definitely is a new face from when I started coming in here when Westgate was first built but this Westgate crap has turned into a war zone waiting to happen with all the police waiting to beat and hurt someone probably. Very uncomfortable environment at night. A bunch of unnecessary mistreatment going on here for sure,  and I am sick of it.  I can't stand Westgate anymore. Don't waste your valueable  money or time here.  Go to Scottsdale, at least you pretty much know what your going to get up there.  Same shit. Same treatment. Better environment of a crowd. No police waiting to beat you down either.",

Then, without even a complaint on my end, the soup was taken off my bill. This situation was handled perfectly and even a little too apologetic (but that's better then nothing).  Also, we came at a weird time so our waitress was changing shifts. Before she left she introduced our new waitress and thanked us for coming and how it was \"nice to meet us\". Most waitresses and waiters just leave and don't tell the table/ leave us with someone new.

    "text": "Went with a decent sized group to the Yard House and was able to try out a lot of different menu items.  For appetizers we had the chicken nachos, onion rings, and the crab dip.  The onion rings were a bit limp/soggy but tasted alright, the crab dip was quite delicious with the pita however they give you way more bread than dip, and the nachos were pretty spot on and quite tasty.    I ended up also getting their wings as my meal, the traditional wing flavor is delicious, I also tried the other sauces, the Jerk sauce was flavorful and I'd certainly consider getting that at some point, the Hot sauce that they have in my opinion doesn't have that great of a taste to it and is maybe a 2-3/10 on spicy (note that I usually consumer very spicy dishes so this maybe rather hot for yourself).  Around the table a few people ordered the chicken rice bowls which all seemed to really enjoy and another got the fish and chips.  The fish and chips had a lot of pieces which is a plus, however the overall flavor was considered 'okay'.  This venue has an ungodly large selection for beers and other drinks if that's your thing, but it was noted they did not have flights.  Our service was a bit lacking on keeping drinks refilled and bringing things to the group in a timely manner otherwise I'd say this would be deserving of a fourth star.  Their menu is quite diverse and is sure to have something for everyone in the group so there's no need to worry about anyone lacking choices.",

    "text": "It was a decent lunch for this Sunday afternoon. The service was good. It could have been a better experience if they would have refilled my drink when they stopped to ask how we were doing.  Ordered the Ahi tuna appetizer and the Korean BBQ short ribs with rice. Normally they have the jasmine rice on the side when I order this appetizer, but for some reason this time they put the BBQ right over a bed of rice, which I don't mind...however the rice was drenched with the sweet sauce and I had to try to eat the inside of it where it wasn't as drenched.   The ahi tuna was a good size serving for one person therefore I was full after eating that and just the BBQ beef and small side veggies that was on the plate.   We also ordered the classic cheeseburger and cup of clam chowder.  That was decent.   The place was clean! The booth was nice and comfy and clean!",

We got the coconut shrimp that had a mildly coconutty flavor. No visible coconut on the shrimp itself. We got something else, but I honestly can't remember what it was if that tells you anything.

We were a group of 6 and were sat by the pleasant hostess in a long extended booth that satisfied us all very comfortably.  One of our guests ordered the Asada Street tacos & tried the new Vampire Taco- really good! Their Street Taco's are a \"very popular menu item\" & with many different offerings in flavors: \" that you are bound to try one you'll really like\"! I had their lunch special for $9.95. Got the Margarita Pizza which was kinda average in flavor cause I believe they used canned stewed tomatoes instead of fresh, which I didn't really care for! This came with a side salad, it was ok. It had the dressing mixed into it & veggies were chopped up, so it more reminded me of a slaw than a salad. Blue cheese dressing was very good though. Hubby had the BBQ burger with a fried egg on top! Garlic fries are always tasty! Our daughter had the kids meal chicken teriyaki & french fries. One of her favorites. It comes with a side of sauce to dip your chicken chunks in and the fries are always crisp & delicious!   Great experience over all.",

After the best concert I've seen in decades, we spent the night within walking distance of Yard House, and there we arrived for lunch the next day. We each ordered a Bloody Mary, and encountered a teachable moment: Never entered my mind to say, \"Hold the bacon,\" and never entered the mind of the server to mention that \"There might be a slab of pig in your drink.\" No harm, no foul.  Fully planning to depart with plenty of leftovers, we ordered enough to keep the kitchen busy for weeks. Here I'd like to recognize Chelsea for patience and an easy manner. Upon ordering a particular dish, she recommended an alternative instead; let the record show that we wholeheartedly agree with her call. She was very attentive without being intrusive, and when all was said and done, her dessert *advice* was solid. Chelsea, you rock.  Thanks, Yard House, you've never let us down.",

I couldn't really tell who our server was because there were so many people helping us out (that's because we had over 10 people with us).  Our servers were very patient because some of our guests wasn't able to make it to the restaurant on time and we wanted to wait for most of us to get there before we order food. The food came out at expected time. I ordered rib eye steak. It was amazing but I couldn't eat it all. I still don't think it's worth $30 for a steak. Over all a good experience.

I usually order allot from the happy hour menu because the food can be quite allot. I've read some other reviews complaining about their portion sizes but to me they're just perfect.   I have to say on this specific night, Jeremy our sever, was completely rude and had MAJOR attitude towards our table. It made me felt very unwelcome and wanted to leave right away. Every time I ask something or even add to the order he gives off this vibe that makes me feel so uncomfortable. I don't know if he had a bad night but my table did nothing wrong so he should of left his feelings aside and serve our table with a better attitude.   Sorry Yard House but 3 stars because of Jeremy. I'll definitely be back but if he is my server again I would walk out and come back.",

Our waitress was kind and answered all of our questions and even gave recommendations. We ended up getting the ahi nachos, Brussels sprouts and potatoes, the short ribs, Diablo shrimp pasta and the bf got a burger. The Diablo shrimp and black pasta was honestly forgettable. The short ribs were tender, sweet and delicious. The ahi tuna nachos? I could eat that all day, the fish was fresh and avocado was ripe, it was just so good. And the Brussels, yummmmmmmm. The bf said the chicken burger was good, but nothing super special.   Oh I almost forgot the drinks!! It's was during Ocktoberfest so my bf got a beer with a take home stein! I got 2 sangria, and not we're they perfectly strong and delicious!!   All in all we will be coming back to try the rest of the menu.",

I ordered... correction I attempted to order a chicken-less chicken burger with cheese and avocado which was on the menu but I personally don't like the chicken-less chicken so I just wanted extra avocado, cheese and whatever else came on the sandwich. How so ever the waitress said that she couldn't do that (remove the meatless patty) and I asked why and she basically said they are not made for custom-order....?? So I said I'll pay the same price just toss the petty she still said no she didn't go and ask anyone she didn't go talk to the manager or the Cook or anything she just said it couldn't be done so I just said okay moving right along... so I ended up ordering Buffalo cauliflower bites in truffle fries...my \"date\" (using that term very loosely...lol) ordered a pulled pork with bacon burger? It looked REALLY good...but y'all know ya girl doesn't eat the meats...lol when my waitress brought his Burger she also brought me cold cauliflower bites and cold truffle fries I sent them back the manager came out and apologized because they were cold and said they had to me make me fresh food and once it got there it was delicious but I ended up waiting 20 minutes to sit down 20 minutes to wait for my food to come the first time and then 20 more minutes for to be redelivered order I only ordered sides basically so it was a bit taxing... But let's not throw away the whole experience! the Truffle fries were amazing if you are in the area- try the Truffle fries...they are delicious the burgers looked good as well and they also had many vegetarian options All in all if I had originally ordered the Truffle fries and buffalo cauliflower bites I would have given them at least a 4!  but because of the wait and the poor customer service from our waitress I gave them a 3.... #trufflefriesforlife",

The food is pretty good, it looks good, smells good and taste good, and feels good in the belly, but I have to say the portion size is not too big.  We never had to box anything up.  The staffs has always been friendly, and service has always been quick and prompt.  The atmosphere of this place is quite lively, and the restrooms had always been clean.    Overall a good place to chill with friends and enjoy some food.  I'm sure we'll be back many more times in the future.",

This location is just as good, a bit crowded than I prefer but we did go on a Saturday night. The Seared Ahi Crunch salad is amazing and my husband loved his chorizo tacos. The kids meals were a good size and my kids loved the food. Adult drinks are very pricey but overall the atmosphere, service and food is so good, I don't mind the extra bucks for a margarita (which was VERY yummy)",

The hot mustard dill pickles and warm ports on toasted roll dipped into their special pork dipping sauce is one of the best Cubans I have ever had and it consistently good no matter what Yard House I am at. Another great feature is all the beers on tap. One can go to get the regular ones or try one of the many craft beers the rotate through their bars. A great experience every time.",

To start our server took 5 minutes to come get our drinks (it was 4PM on Sunday, so it was slow) and when she did come over she was rushed and not very friendly. The food was blah and didn't have any flavor (wings and tomato soup for appetizers and Cuban sandwich for dinner). Also they never brought my daughter fries and they were out of vanilla ice so my kids didn't get any dessert. The only bright spot was the blood orange IPA which was delicious!  I know Yard House is a very tempting choice in Westgate but there are plenty of other option to choice from that are so much better.",

She was super friendly and gave us awesome recommendations when it came to ordering the queso dip!! The restaurant was packed since there was a hockey game in a couple of hours. I was concerned that with how busy it was, service would kind of lack. But I was 100% wrong! Amber did a fantastic job by keeping eyes not only us, but all of her tables! Will definitely be going back and hopefully getting Amber as out server again!",

They have an ipa flight which is great but if you love Belgium's like I do that's the way to roll. Their happy hour is awesome they have several menu items which are half price from pizzas to sushi which  I know you wouldn't think...but their poke stack is my favorite! I have had many things off their menu everything was good with the exception of the ribeye steak although it was ok somehow when you think of a ribeye you think big and thick. It had no bone and was very thin. Just go with anyone of their many other choices.",

We needed somewhere close to eat. All restaurants were swamped from concert goers, but when we walked up to the packed Yard House, they were very accommodating and we took their last table outside. Thankfully on a hot summer day, the misters and prompt service of water made everything okay.  While the restaurant was totally full, our waiter never seemed stressed and checked in on us often. He was very knowledgeable about all the beers and even provided our table with a sample.  I tried a happy hour martini. I would never not pay happy hour prices for their drinks. It was okay, but I think if I am ever there again, I would just get a glass of wine (since I don't drink beer)  As for the food, I chose their 4 cheese pizza which was on happy hour pricing. It was 11 inches and only 6 dollars and change! What a deal and a yummy pizza to boot! I decided to add pepperoni onto it. Each topping is 1.00. My husband and his sister had burgers which were some of the best I have tried. Be warned that their BBQ sauce is on the sweeter end, but all sauces for your burgers are on the side. Their fries are those yummy thin fries that make it easy for you to eat a lot of them. Members of our table also ordered a Cobb Salad which was good and Jambalaya. If you can't make it to New Orleans, this will do the trick!  I would have given this place a three if it wasn't for the pizza (especially with the amazing happy hour price) and the burgers. So I say come during happy hour.",

We ordered the onion rings which I won't eat anywhere else but at the yard house.  We had the truffle fries, pork belly tacos and the short rib tacos.  The tacos were ok, and for $4.95 for just one taco I'll probably not order those again.  My husband ordered the Gorgonzola burger with mushrooms.  That was really really good.  I would order that again.  My husband had several different types of beer and I ordered a hawaiian sunset.  If they cost less than $6.25 as the happy hour price I would have more of them.

I always ask a waiter/waitress what they recommend when I've never been to a place before, and I probably should have taken his suggestions because...BLAH!  I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken breast, which I have at the homes of southern people so I know it's supposed to be wonderful with a variety of spices in the breading.  This came out a beautiful golden brown and what looked like maybe pepper sprinkles.  It was about as tasteless as chicken can be, and there was no salt and pepper to be had, only parmesan cheese and hot pepper flakes, which I would only put on pizza or Italian food, which I didn't have.  The potatoes were good with the garlic infused and the spinach leaves that were laid in between layers were kind of wilted but tasteless.  The gravy that came in a separate boat looked like skim milk and kind of tasted like that too, no thickness at all and certainly no flavor...gravy needs to be boiled to get that wonderful southern cooking flavor and this was just flat, and again no spices so no way to even make it taste better.  The best thing on the plate was the creamed corn, which was about two tablespoons of it and the coke that I drank.  They got TWO stars because of the service and for no other reason. I paid $20 for a meal that I wouldn't serve to guests in my home it was so tasteless.",

Beers & water came quickly. So far, so good. Around 3:20ish our waiter finally takes our order. Spinach dip app. Which comes about 10 minutes later with like 8 pita bread chips. Sad looking plate. Around 4:15 our waiter comes back and says \"um what did you order again?\" So we tell him & at around 4:30 we get 2 more dishes steaming hot.. like burn your mouth hot. Then 10 minutes later my California roll comes out half cold, half hot. I kid you not. The last time I had it the whole thing was warm. I did not like the half cold/hot thing. It was not good. Then we were brought the wrong check.  Our waiter was trying very hard to be pleasant & friendly, but overall this was just not a good dining experience. Over an hour for food is unacceptable.",

    "text": "I am so sick and tired of giving this place \"another chance\". I used to LOVE coming here and I never complained about: 1--The long wait to be seated EVERYTIME I came. 2--The overpriced menu, considering the portions.  3--The long wait time to be served EVERYTIME I came.  However, over the last year or so, it seems as though the portions are even smaller and the service is slower. I take blame for returning, but I guess I just keep thinking that the food will taste like it used to. 100% of the time that we've gone over the past year (which is at least once a month to meet up with friends), we've had to return the fries (small portion, by the way) because they are cold EVERY SINGLE TIME. We just went last Saturday night (which is why I decided to finally write this review), and there weren't many customers because it was right before they closed. We figured that it would taste better since there were less people to cater to. Sadly, the food was worse. My husband's bread was so hard that it was falling apart and the french fries were, once again, cold! When we told the waiter (who I will say was very nice and professional---yayyy!), he did bring us out some more fries, but guess what? You guessed it, the fries were not fresh. It was sooooo evident that all they did was get old fries and just refry them. Therefore, we were eating fries that were as crunchy as potato chips, but at that point, we just got tired of complaining. In the end, we didn't enjoy spending $43 on a burger and fries that he didn't eat, 1 beer, and nachos (this actually is a huge portion, I will say). The time before this, my food was decent, but of course, my fries were cold. The complaint came from my friend. First, they brought her food out long after they brought ours out.  Secondly, her sushi was completely flavorless and she said the fish tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. When she told them, they brought her back a new one, but she couldn't eat it because it was too salty. My friend tried it, and said she was absolutely right. They both said it tasted like they dropped the salt bottle on the sushi. I felt so bad for her because she was hungry, but she didn't get to eat dinner. About two weeks before that, I met up with some friends after work. I ordered a sandwich, and was very specific about the bacon being extra crispy since I am pregnant and do not want to consume raw meat. I also said no mayonnaise and I mentioned that every time I come, I have to return the fries because they are cold. I said this in hopes that she would let the cooks know, and therefore, I wouldn't have to return them again. They brought my meal out with mayonnaise and the bacon was very gristly. When I told them, they brought me a new one. This time, I was happy to see that the bacon was crispy, but they put mayonnaise on it AGAIN.....AND my fries were cold (sigh!). Of course, I got my meal after everybody was done eating too. I decided not to complain again, but I wasn't very happy about paying for a meal that I didn't eat. There are other incidences, but I feel that these are enough.",

When we complained to the manager, she rolled her eyes and asked to remake our food like we were an inconvenience. The general manager walked by and did not even address the issue. $70 worth of food and drinks in the trash because it was in all our food, including the 4 year olds fruit. Even when we attempted to cover our food it was on everything because the waitstaff would walk through the blowing seeds and then when they put it on the table it would go into the food even more. Is this not a health code violation? Why wounldn't you move a family when you noticed that they had the coaster on top of their drinks? Why would they seat someone in this spot if stuff was falling from the trees?? #notgoodservice #wasteofmymoney #horribleexperience",

The house IPA is fine, but I liked the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed better.   The house White Ale was good, per my wife.  Hits in terms of food were the truffle fries (well worth an extra $1), and I had the Cuban Pork Dip, which was great.  Thin sliced pork on a roll with good veggies and condiments and the red mojo dip on the side was the perfect amount of heat and spice.

    "text": "Oh yeah, this place. I've actually been here before, not this one in particular but the one in Miami Beach on a blistering hot day. By myself even and only because I mistook it for Yardbird where all the cool people like Anthony Bourdain and Questlove eat fried chicken. Nope, Yard House is not where the cool people eat either in Miami Beach or Glendale. How would I know? Because I was eating there, and I was with colleagues for a work dinner, mostly male colleagues who probably thought a sports bar would make a good, non-threatening bonding environment. There were other tables like ours. Bonding. Talking shop. Asking me about sports teams I don't know and then having to fake a response of interest.  There are apparently 66 Yard Houses across the country. It feels like that kind of place, packaged with way too many options on the menu for an indecisive crew. Of course, that meant huge platters of finger-food appetizers to tie us over like the $12.25 Chicken Nachos, excessively over-accessorized with beans, cheese, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream, as well as the $11.25 mound of Fried Calamari with both spicy tomato sauce and roasted jalapeno tartar for dipping and the $12.65 Poke Stack with marinated raw ahi, crispy wontons, avocado, and wasabi soy sauce (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F29YG26H&s=b37ffcfdf8a5175ffafb7393ce48599c006c10252f23195b183420cfa0f368a0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/29YG26H</a>). There was certainly plenty to go around, although none of it was all that memorable to the palate. Keeping it real.  For my entree, I chose the $16.65 Nashville Hot Chicken which offered one good-size fried chicken breast topped with fried sage and accompanied by a short stack of sweet potato pancakes, and pickles with ranch dressing and honey hot sauce on the side (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2aatqea&s=1573a565aad4ecbc8b168341e609376ee29ff98bd27fef123a42772355522014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2aatqea</a>). I only knew to order it from my trip to Nashville with Jamie W. last year when we had Hattie's. That was awesome. By contrast, this was just pretty good with the pancakes a bit of carb overkill. I think I fared better than most of my tablemates who were feeling rather bloated from all the food and beer. I have to say the waitstaff was extremely attentive throughout our meal, something I appreciated since I needed to go back to the hotel and do some work. Guess I didn't embarrass myself too badly. I still have my job.  FOOD - 3 stars...mostly passable bar-level food and way too many choices on the menu AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...a sea of TV screens with big party booths aimed at them SERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive considering it is a sports bar after all TOTAL - 3 stars...if you've been to one Yard House...",

    "text": "Ate here for the first time. Had salmon which was well prepared but for $25 it was way over priced. My friend ordered a ribeye and it was grilled absolutely perfectly and tender as could be. It was $30 and also priced too high in my opinion.   The seating was nice with accommodations for everyone, if you like booth or table with chairs that are size friendly and everything is not crowded together.    As for going back, Not. unless it was because I was specifically asked to go there by friends.  The reason for that is because I think it's just priced too high. There are other places I'd rather go if I was spending that kind of money, such as a fine dining experience. This is a sports bar!",

Thankfully the portions at the Yard House are fantastically huge.   I ordered the Tuna Poke nachos and a soup and salad combo.  I really didn't need the combo, but it seemed more civilized to have a a little something else before descending on a plate full of sashimi tuna, avocado, green onion, jalapeno, with a drizzle of sauce-amazingness, on top of wonton crisps.      The Poke nachos were better than I ever imagined. You. Must. Try. Them.   My husband had the bacon breakfast sandwich with a side cup of fruit. He said it was really good. It looked like something I would order if there wasn't Poke nachos available.   The staff is sparse and needs either training or an attitude adjustment.  I hope our waitress  was an outlier. I really like the Yard House.   Place was packed by the time we left. Glad we got in early.",

I am a deep believer in not going to places when I'm out of town that I could enjoy within the proximity of my area. But Glendale left me no option.  You know what you're getting at the Yard House. It is a level above your Chili's and TGI's. Decent bar food, okay happy hour, half yard drinks, and then you let the service dictate the rest.   The service here was okay, they had a server shift switch but I am glad it happened because our 2nd server was much better. Their only slip up was them leaving me waiting for water. If Bobby Boucher can serve up high quality h20 why can't you?  The facility is well kept, restrooms are spacious, their TV game is lacking a bit from what I'm used to from the location in Oxnard, of all places.   The Yard House is quite predictable. If you've never been to one I suggest you do, just like me, you won't mind it for when there are no better options.",

I ordered a burger and the waitress suggested the onion rings, the burger was ok but the onion rings were also way over cooked. One alcoholic drink and a soda, both sodas came out flat and the waitress said all the flavors are that way. $50 not well spent at all.

Our server came by when he dropped off the drinks much later. He failed to introduce himself to us until he came back a second time. We never received the appetizer we ordered. My food came out wrong, they brought me a turkey club when I ordered a chicken sandwich. Our waiter Brandon came by to check on us 5 minutes after the food had been dropped off to see I didn't have any. He came back a couple minutes later still unsure what I ordered. It took a total of 12 minutes after this whole ordeal for me to get my food, by that time everyone I was eating with was finished. The manager stopped by and said it was my fault to have ordered the wrong sandwich... except he wasn't the one who took my order so how would he know. No apologies.. no urgency when they mistaking bring you the wrong food, lack of good management, zero customer service, extremely slow and shitty service.

Well this will be in my top 10 in the southwest region. They have a whole section that is devoted to vegans and vegetarians.  They even have a nice selection of beer on tap. This will be visited often.",

    "text": "We hit up the yard house before a Cardinals/Bears game.    When you first see the line out the door you get a little discouraged.  But we had come early enough to suck it up and wait.  The line outside the door is just the wait to get inside so they do not go over capacity.  Once inside you can put your name down for a table, or go to the patio/lounge, or hit the bar.  We put our name down for a table, then hit the bar.  Surprisingly they have a decent system here, that works.  They have roped off areas where they do not want people standing in order for the servers to get in and out.  And that is actually super helpful.  We were able to get up to the bar and order drinks, step back, and watch TV while waiting for our table.  They said it would be an hour and a half wait for a table but I think we were seated after an hour.  It really wasn't that bad.  And once seated, service was really good and quick.  No problems at all.    Definitely recommend it before a football game, but be prepared to wait a little while.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place instead of Gordon Biersch. Previous Yard House experiences varied among our group, so never hurts to try again!   The place was hopping because of a USA soccer game nearby. The beer selection is amazing, to say the least! The food? Well.... the Firecracker wings were tasty. Of the 3 plates we ordered (2 burgers and one french dip) the dip was by far the best. Both burgers were ordered medium. One came out looking like a charred hockey puck and the other came out undercooked. Sent the charred one back and the new one was only slightly better. The burger in general was quite bland, as no seasoning at all in the meat, and was rather small for $12.   When the bill came, we were billed for an additional burger (the one that was sent back because it was burned). Our server acted all ditzy about the mistake and didn't even offer to make any sort of adjustment to the bill for the repeated screw ups.   I understand that the place was busy, but there is no excuse for creating one of the worst burgers ever, double billing for it, then not making any effort to compensate for multiple problems. Needless to say, won't be going back here for anything other than a beer.",

I don't eat meat and they have a whole section of their menu that caters to that. They also remember me when I come in and treat me well. Everyone always brings up the price point (which isn't bad at all when you look at it) but when it comes to great food, beer, and service, wouldn't you pay top dollar for that? We are talking $10-15 plates, and $5 craft beer.. That sounds normal to me? Either way I have been here more times than I can count and it's better every time I come. Yard house is simply the best.",

    "text": "Staying at the Renaissance next door on a business trip, our group decided to have dinner here one night.  They took our reservation for 8 less than an hour ahead of time and we were seated as soon as we arrived.  The bar itself offered quite a bit of seating and looked full, and the dining area was pretty well packed also.  We were seated at an awkwardly deep U-shaped booth... the people seated at the inside had to scoot a good 15 feet to their seat.  As many have already said, the beer selection is great.  They also have samplers if you don't know exactly what you want and you can try most of their draft offerings in glasses of varying sizes depending on whether you're just trying something new or you know what you like and want a lot of it.  The food selection is pretty large and the menu takes a while to get through, as a result you know a good portion of it is premade, pre-packaged.  However, it still tastes pretty damn good.  I tried some of the spicy tuna and moo shu egg roll appetizers.  For my main course I had the orange peel chicken.  I enjoyed everything I tried.  The prices weren't unusual for a mid-scale restaurant in an outdoor mall-type setting.    Dessert was a taste of their mini-trio sampler... a small lemon souffle, peach apple cobbler, and chocolate souffle.   Each excellent.  Service was a bit off, the waiter came across as somewhat arrogant or haughty, not really personable.  They didn't check back very often to ensure drinks were refilled promptly.  But over all, it was only a minor detraction from an otherwise above average dining experience.  Definitely worth a visit, and will be happy to try again next time I'm in town.",

The menu offered a nice selection of foods including many more healthy options instead of just your usual bar-fare.  As for drinks, if you are a beer drinker they offer a very large selection of beers.  I tried the house IPA which was not bad, but tasted more like a pale ale rather than an IPA (low bitterness and lack of hop profile).  Over the services was very good with friendly staff but receiving items we ordered including drinks was rather slow.  Outside of that the Yard House is certainly a nice place to consider especially if the weather is nice since it offers a large patio with plenty of seating.",

My son is autistic and an extremely picky eater; he'll only eat tortilla chips in restaurants. Yard House offers good chips and is always willing to serve the toppings on the side. That's greatly appreciated.  I love their ahi crunchy salad and I've had several of their flatbreads, too. I like that they have the nutrition information online. It makes it easy for me to choose foods that are healthy and yet still an indulgence!  I recently took my parents and brother here while they were on a visit.  My brother raved about the (Mac + Cheese)2, and he's pretty difficult to please with food. My Mom enjoyed her roasted turkey cobb salad. My dad had a cheeseburger and liked it, though the fries were thin for his preference. Can't please everyone!  When my husband is able to come along, he loves Yard House for their beer selection, too. I've had cocktails here in the past and enjoyed them.",

This is the only place I know of that offers vegetarian hot wings and obscure things such as that.   It's a little hard to get to; you have to go through the batshittery of West Gate. But it's worth it if you're hungry and / or lazy and can't cook. Yay!",

However, took 20 minutes to get drinks. Didn't get our food until 7:00!!! Moms steak was undercooked and was still undercooked when they brought another one. My brothers pasta obviously sat under the heat lamp forever while they cooked my moms steak because it was crusty and dried out. My husbands gnocchi had a hair in it. All they did to make it right was offer free dessert. I felt bad convincing my family who had never been there to try it out. I will stick to the location in Desert Ridge.",

Wait time on food was on par with any other restaurant with comparable menu.  Thought I might be on the set of \"Cheers\", because both Jeriod and Darin were spot on with everyone's name at the bar. First time at Yard House.  I'll stop in next time I'm in the area. Pricing is around $15-$20 for an entree, around $6-$8 for a pint of beer. The movie theater is next door so you can wait out the booze while catching a flick.  Figured it was $10 for an Uber or $10 for a movie.",

    "text": "Super disappointed. We went in with a party of 8 adults 3 kids. We sat in the patio and while the mist was going it was great but then they turned it off and we immediately felt the humidity and each one of the little hoses was dripping on to us and our table.   We had 2 servers, overall they were super friendly but it was clear they didn't communicate with each other. They each asked if we wanted appetizers. They each asked if we were ready for our bill. When both had been taking care of by the one that came first. It was a male server and female server. We ordered through the male server, he forgot a salad that was ordered so we asked the female server. The chop salad that had been forgotten ended up being very bland anyway :/ . Then we returned a watery clam chowder back to the male server and nothing was done on the bill for it. We didn't want anything to replace it. The woman server didn't even know we returned it.  It was just very unorganized.  I have been to this location several times before so I know what a wonderful experience is & idk if it was just an off night for them but our experience was not great overall. Also, the food quality seems to be suffering. I didn't care for the enchilada stack that I ordered. I've had it before and thought it was great before.   Otherwise, I loved the ambiance. But I don't think I'll be back by choice.",

    "text": "It is the only decent spot to pregame in Westgate.  That is why it is 4 stars.  But honestly, I want to give it 3 stars.    Yard House always end up being the go to spot when other options suck.  It is like that in almost every city.  Or if your too lazy to look and try something new.  Example: -LA Live is similar to Westgate, but a tad better.  And guess where we end up? Yard damn House. -Looking for something on a week day night in Long Beach because everything is closed?  YH to the rescue! -Want affordable drinks in Waikiki?  Or reverse HH?  Yep, Waikiki YH has you covered except for a 1-2 buck higher than the mainland. -Las Vegas, Well, I don't know why we came to this one, but its was there so we ended up there somehow...  I seriously can go on with all the Yard Houses I have been to.  The best thing about Yard freakin House?  Over a 100 beers on tap, although I consider at least 20 of them worthless.  Like michelob ultra on tap?? Or Coors @Light?  Crap beers.  (sorry no offense to ya'll who like those beers).  I think I saw Red Stripe...  Food is okay.  I have had almost everything on the HH menu plus quite a few of their regular menu items.  Some great some bad, most were okay.  Service is okay.  Everything is usually okay until you start drinking then its fun.  I have never reviewed a Yard House before because that is like reviewing every damn Starbucks I have been to.  I think I will just copy and paste this with some adjustments to the location.  But despite this rant.. I am a fan.",

Our waiter came over and we placed our order. Lunch special with pizza and tomato basil soup, kids meal with pizza and veggies and ahi appetizer which  was being eaten for lunch and not appetizer.  My cousin also ordered a beer, which took forever to come out.  The waiter finally came over after about 10 minutes and said they had to replace the keg.    Beer finally came, next we waited for our food... And waited, and waited and waited!  Thank goodness I had snacks in my bag for my 3 year old to settle him while we waited.  When the food did arrive, the cheese on the pizza looked old and dry, as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp for quite awhile.  We only had a few bites and moved on to the soup, which my 3 year old and I basically split because it was delicious +1 star!  Threw the leftover pizza away since it was gross.",

Never been to yard house to I didn't have any expectations. Not busy at all from 3-430. Our bartender/serve was Kelly, Who might come off as strong but she means well. She helps out my guy choosing the right beer and quick service. She was overall great. We had the fried calamari which was a little chewy and chicken nachos which were huge, enough for 4 people but oh so good. Will be coming back",

The noodles, mac and cheese and nachos were just okay, chain restaurant stuff.  The beer menu was even bigger.  I tried two and didnt like either.  Not their fault, pricey and not very cold.  I would definitely go again to try other items.",

One of us ordered the chicken strips appetizer and it came 15 minutes after the rest of the food came. It came extremely burnt with a bad smell. We had to send it back. The manager and waitress were apologetic but everyone was done eating so there was no reason to try again or order something else. I ordered the fried chicken and it was good but the gravy, baked beans, and corn was very cold. I could explain each dish but basically everything was cold. The waitress was very nice and did a good job. I won't be back to this location though.",

Favorite dishes were the blacked sashimi and poke nachos! Food took quite awhile to come out relative to the amount of guest that were there, but still had a great time!",

There was 5 of us attending a conference so after a long day we were hungry. It took a little longer than expected to get service, including our drink orders. I ordered my usual Grilled Chik'n Gardein Sandwich with a side of fries. It didn't take too long to get our meal and my andwich was good so no complaints. Everyone else rated their meals a 4 or 5; however, what held us back from a 5 was the slower service.   Be that as it may, I still love Yard House.",

I also appreciate that they feature a vegetarian section on their menu.  They have a good deal for lunch specials as well.  I enjoy the Gardein Orange chicken as well as the blackened shrimp tacos.  I live in the West Valley and have some family members who live east of this restaurant.  It is the perfect place for us to meet halfway in the middle.

I ordered a margarita and the Cobb Salad. The Cobb salad was very unique. It had greens, kale, tomatoes, edamame, carrots, radish, egg, bleu cheese, corn, bacon, avocado, ranch. It was priced at $10.95 so not too bad for a nice part of town. They have a variety of different types of dishes which are very healthy but sound very tasty.   The overall atmosphere was loud and fun. They have lots of TVs if you want to catch a game. Outside the day I was there, about 15 Corvettes were parked, so that was fun to see.",

As simple as this transaction sounds, I think people make the difference in every customer service experience. Both of them were cheery and clearly enjoyed their job. They definitely deserve a couple shift meals on the house.  I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza with clam chowder lunch combo. The portion was pretty decent for just $10.45. And there's something for everyone. Salads, sandwiches soups etc.  Great for an easy lunch! Hope to come back soon!",

After the manager we had 3 more waiters and waitresses stop by to help and to apologize.   I went during happy hour and some of their appetizers are half off!!! That's amazing!! We ordered a cheese pizza for the kids and I have to admit I stole a piece because it looked so great and it was. I also ordered lumpia, chicken lettuce wraps (which I would definitely order again) and the queso dip. All of the above were great for everyone at the table to share. I was very satisfied with the food and the prices of the happy hour. I will be back to the Yard House.  Bonus they have all Linenkugel seasonal shandys on draft!!!!!",

At some point they reached maximum capacity and were no longer letting people inside.   Once inside, I had friends at both the bar and at a few tables. Given how crazy busy this place was ALL the bartenders, servers, employees did an excellent job of making sure everyone was getting everything they needed.   They have a HUGE selection of beers on tap. All the food we tried here was good too. The truffle fries are a must try. The pizza is good, and you can customize the toppings.

We were lucky to snag bar seats and the staff did pretty well keeping up with the crowd (even though they seemed to surprised to be so busy for a Monday - I guess they don't scope out the show schedules). We ordered some food and even though our order was incorrect when delivered, they fixed it pretty quickly. Big menu of bar classics and some things you wouldn't expect. Boneless wings and cheese curds were decent, but not memorable. Overall, a good stop before a show and definitely worthwhile for some HH beers and snacks. More like a 3.5 if I could!",

We were told that this cat roaming our feet has already had two litters and is obviously pregnant again.  It was very unnerving to have a feral cat bothering us & making us feel uncomfortable.  There are agencies that can be called to help this cat such as the Feral Cat Coalition.  I would suggest that management be a little more proactive not only for the cat but for their customers.",

This is my FAVORITE spot at Westgate to have a few drinks and eat, and one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES.  I've been to this location a handful of times, from lunch to dinner to late night.  I have tried a variety from the menu.  Everything has been primo.  My favorite is the Vodka Shrimp Pasta.  Goes so well with a half yard of New Belgium 1554.  The service is consistently superb.  Lighting, noise level, seating option, spacing, cleanliness- all outstanding.  I mean, compare this to competitors such as BJs and Rock Bottom.  All have similar prices, but the food quality, selection of food and drinks, and service (for starters) are superior at Yard House (particularly Westgate Yardhouse).  I've been to just about all of the Yard Houses in Cali and AZ.  This one is my favorite.  My previous favorite was in Long Beach, on the water.  But then when I really thought about it the water is dirty and stinks half the time, like most of the LA area does.   They have an very solid website, and options to order online and pick up.  Haven't tried this yet, but it's a nice option.   I'm a guy that is still a little mad the full yards got taken away.  But I understand it's not the company's fault.  YARD HOUSE ROCKS!",

    "text": "I hate to do this, but I totally give it a one star. The first time I was here it was great and then I came here a few day ago and I had a horrific experience. I came in after 5pm with my friend and I asked the waitress if I can customize my meal and she says yeah of course. So I told her that I'm a simple person and I just wanted angel hair pasta and grilled chicken. I order a beer as well, and of course the beer comes first. So we're drinking having a good time and then the food comes and my dish is filled with vegetables and just completely wrong and not what I wanted. The waitress apologized and admitted she misunderstood what I said and I had no problem, it's okay it happens. At this point I was kinda upset because my friend started eating and I haven't even received my food yet. 8 min later my food comes out and by the time I picked up my fork my food was cold and in all honesty it was our fault that we chose to sit outside when there was a breeze, but my food was very cold. After that I realized there was no Alfredo sauce and it was solo dry so I asked if they had any Alfredo sauce and she said they don't. I asked her for butter at least and she brings me frozen butter which won't melt on a cold pasta dish. So I was stuck eating butter pasta with cold butter stuck to each noodle. I found a piece of broccoli in my dish and a random noodle that wasn't angel hair as well. I'm almost done eat and my second beer hasn't arrived, so I flag a random waiter and ask him if he can cancel my beer because I'm done eating already and my second beer hasn't come yet. By the time he leaves our waitress comes with my beer. Ugh! I tell her I cancelled it and she says it's on the house. Eventually the manager came and talked to me and I explained to her what happened and she didn't charge me for the pasta. Thank god I didn't have to pay for that because I make better pasta then that. Pasta is pasta how do you mess that up? You can tell the chefs didn't stir it because some noodles were stuck together. I mean cmon I'm not asking you to make me lobster. It's just pasta. I don't think I'll be back and if I ever get forced to come here I'll sit inside and come on a not so busy day. :/",

    "text": "We visited the Yard House for the first time today for lunch. We arrived at 11:45AM & were surprised to see how chaotic it was to get seated. After about a 5 minute wait, we were seated. Then we waited another 10 minutes before our server even appeared at our table!  The place wasn't even busy so we had no idea why the delays - not off to a good start.  Can't talk about the beer - all 113 varities of them - none of us drank beer. We all had soda or ice tea, at $3 a glass, a small glass I might add, we thought it was too high a price. Yes they have free refills, but when the wait service was so slow, our glasses were empty until we could flag down our waiter & ask for that refill, none came from the waiter unasked for.  They have a large menu, lots of variety. Price wise, a bit high for the portions, and the dinner items ranged on average from $15 to $35 for an entree. 3 of us had a 1/2 sandwich & soup - all were very good. I had the chicken tortilla soup- for an extra $1.95, the other soups were no extra, which was excellent. Our 4th party had a salad with chicken in it which she said was dried out.    Would I go back?  Perhaps I would give this place another try, maybe we just hit them on an off day. However, if they have too many off days, they won't be in business long!",

The beers are good but I would not recommend getting the tasters. All of the beer taster were American beers you could find at any bar in the valley. My recommendation is to try the hefeweizens if you you like Belgium beers and with a pizza. But by far the Yard House has one of the best selections of beer in valley.   If you are beer enthusiast you need to stop at the Yard House.",

Last time we went, almost each person in a party of five was so dissatisfied with their dinner. Finally, someone from our party made a complaint. They sent someone out and simply asked if we wanted to have our table cleared. No apologies or anything. And yes we paid for everything from the drinks, appetizers, and bad dinner. And of course fully tipped our server even though we'd had to wait for a long time just to get refills. Maybe they need to stop experimenting with their menus so they can keep up but also need to keep in mind their repeat customers and provide better customer service. Definitely will not be our go to place anymore.",

If you like a Moscow Mule and also like pineapple, you will love this drink. One of the dishes we ordered was the spicy tuna roll. It is not presented like you would think from a Japanese restaurant. It was a circular stack of layers of cucumbers, edamame, carrots, guacamole and spicy tuna in the middle. It wasn't a big deal that this was not the traditional spicy tuna roll, but the tuna was not good. And the proportions of every else was just off and not balanced well. A manager had happen to walk by to check on people and she stopped at out table. Everything was great and we just told her about the spicy tuna roll. She apologized and offered to take it off the bill which we did not expect. We were just explaining to her that they may want to take that item off the menu. I had ordered the poke stack and I thought the tuna was fine. Despite being so busy there, the service was still impeccable and we never waited long for something to drink or a refill. Everything else we ordered was delicious.",

    "text": "So here is the reason I'm posting my first Yelp review ever....As a regular user of Yelp and a restaurant owner myself(East Valley), I thought today's experience was a good qualifier for what it was intended for, to let people know what they should know before they spend their money. First I want to make it clear that my wife and I frequent both locations in Desert Ridge and Scotts Fashion Mall and even on occasion, Newport Beach and want it to be known that we consider Yard House one of our favorite restaurants to sit down and have a beer and one of the only places we know of that serves consistently great food. Today we went to Westgate for lunch to meet some friends and family that live in the area and to watch the Cardinal game. We decided to go early and catch the end of a couple games before the Cardinals started and we ended up having our usual bites and a few beers. We sat between two tv's on the west side of the bar so that we could see more games and also figured that the Cardinals would end up on atleast one.  With 3-4 seats open on both sides of us and basically only crickets chirping, the tv's kept changing with games late in the 4th with only minutes left. My wife and I were in total disbelief and figured that someones toddler must have gotten ahold of the remote. Anyway, FFWD, our entree shows and the Cardinal game comes on the tv to our right and the 49's game to our left..life is good...beer is good...food is normally good (not today).... and then all of a sudden the toddler from hell turns both tv's to the 49's game. I looked at the bar tender and raised my arms and without a word he turns around and goes and gets the manager. The manager comes and says that he can't please everyone and that if we would like to move he would accommodate. I said we are in WESTGATE for f*** sake and I cant believe you don't have the game on for patrons that have been waiting on atleast one of the tv's.  Again in disbelief, I looked around me at the people wearing Cardinal garb who are now moving somewhere else to find a tv with the Cardinal game on...Krazy! From where we were sitting we could see 6 tv's and only 2 of them had the Cardinal game on and the rest were all 49's. The only 2 were clear across the dining area. So my take on the Yard House @ Westgate is it caters to all the fair-weather transplant fans of Arizona that would rather see the Dodgers, Lakers, Raiders and apparently, even the 49's. FFwd again...grabbed our check contacted our friends and we all met at Gordon B., where they appreciate the local sports and what Westgate stands for.... To be fair, the 1-star is for the trigger happy toddler who comp'd our drinks after dismissing our significance at the bar....Their are plenty of choices in this area, follow the crowds and not the crickets if you want to watch the local sports!",

It makes me a jolly good fellow\" - this place claims to have the world's largest selection of draft beer, and while I have not completed the research (would love to start), it had an impressive selection. The menu had 2 full pages of beer...that being said, I had water...I went with a friend for lunch before the University of Phoenix graduation ceremonies on Friday. Right around lunch time and with the early graduation already out and the afternoon starting a few hours later I figured it would be busier. Not the case. We went with a selection of various products from the menu - starting with the lobster, artichoke dip. Can you say yummy? That really hit the spot. Next we enjoyed the mixed greens salad, which really, well, it's a salad...and I try to avoid salads, but it was good. Next up was the prime rib French dip sandwich. The size was impressive - bigger than the one a few weeks ago at the Phoenix Greyhound Park and fairly tasty. The server was maybe just a touch slow. He was there at the beginning, but then as the time crunch hit, nowhere to be found. Typical. We unfortunately had to leave without dessert -but I would give it another go.",

    "text": "I won't be as harsh as my hubby about Yard House because I thought it was pretty ok. But truly just ok. In fact, I'd give it more 2.5 stars than the full 3, but I digress.  When we arrived we were informed by two very exasperated too-cool-for-you hostesses that they DO NOT take reservations. When informed that yes, in fact they do, particularly for a party of 10 or more, as per their website and especially when it was taken by the manager who spent 10 painstaking minutes on the phone with me announcing every step he was making in order to secure our reservation and telling me 3 times that everyone would know about our reservation. I should have known then that it would be a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcluster-F.ck&s=4c14edd80af761b6d0ff2a0f516ae5a8349486e5b573e2c824ae565588866e42\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cluster-F.ck</a>. They did find our reservation though on a small scrap of paper near the computer. The too-cool-for-you hostesses never apologized about not having it or being snippy. Then there was a whole lot of scurrying around to accomodate our party. The manager was alerted and he himself worked to get our table ready and was as polite as could be.  We had to wait a considerable amount of time beyond our reservation  time though and that's just not cool.  Our party was seated with Jason as our server. For me, Jason was the saving grace of our experience at Yard House. He was prompt, courteous, and definitely knew how to make things better for us. Our drinks were served promptly and kept filled.  Beers were just the right temp and refreshing. We did have a mishap in the kitchen with my brother's pizza getting burned, but I have to give them props for not trying to serve it anyway and hoping for the best like so many other places would do.   I had the Swiss and Avocado burger and it was great. Friend had Ahi Sandwich and loved it. Hubby had fish and chips and enjoyed them but decided they were a bit bland.. It may have given him a bit of Montezuma's Revenge overnight as well, but you can read his review for those details. Another friend had Gorgonzola burger which he said was VERY salty. The BBQ Chicken pizza enjoyed by brother and his wife was good though it was served about 8 minutes after everyone else's food since the first one got burned. Chicken rice bowl was ENORMOUS, but went over well. Pasta dishes were large and filling as well.  I would say overall, the food was fair, but it was about $5-$10 more in price point per plate than it should have been. Of course, you are paying for location so it's kind of to be expected I suppose.  So, thanks to Jason, my girlfriends and I will probably give Yard House another try....but definitely NOT on a night where there is a game or show at the nearby venues.  It was excessively noisy and the bar definitely took priority over the restaurant aspect of the place. And I might convince the hubby to give it a try again too. Maybe.",

    "text": "I think ordinarily I would give this place 3 stars, but this review is based on my experience here on New Year's Eve.  After attending a Coyotes game, we came over to the Yard House for a late dinner.  Not surprisingly, the place was packed but we were able to find a couch to sit on outside during our 1.5 hour wait for a table.  Yeah, that's a long time to wait for this place, but like I said it was NYE and we didn't have any later plans, so we didn't mind hanging out.  Coincidentally, you can get full bar and menu service on the couches outside and we enjoyed some drinks while happily waiting for a proper table and chairs for dinner.  The food was OK; nothing really to write home about.  My favorite part of the meal was probably dessert - the warm brownie with ice cream was a treat!  When we finished our meal, it was about 11:15 p.m. - definitely too late to go somewhere else to countdown to the new year.  So, we hung out.  Our waitress, Jaime, was very friendly and surprisingly attentive for how busy the restaurant was.  She gave us festive top hats, tiaras, and beads to wear to celebrate.  We were also provided with champagne for a midnight toast.   All of this was free, and there had been no cover charge to get in.  I thought that was a really nice touch.  At ten minutes to the hour, the music turned off and the volume on the TVs, which had all been switched to the big ball drop in NYC, was turned up.  Everybody in the restaurant excitedly awaited the arrival of the new year and when the clock struck 12 there was toasting and cheering.  Yeah, this may all sound very mellow, but it was a fun, relatively cheap (given that every other place had a cover charge and/or price fixe menu), safe place to bring in the new year.",

Don't be shy about asking for samples either. I was overwhelmed by the selection and I told the guy generally what kind of beer I liked and disliked and he picked a perfect beer for me. They also have a \"short\" size so you can try a bunch of different beers.  We didn't try any food, but it looked really good. They have burgers and pub food along with vegetarian foods and salads too.",

THE PLACE WAS PACKED!!!!  I honestly expected the service to be lacking for this reason.  However, the food/drinks were out quickly and the staff was extremely pleasant.  Yard House already has GREAT food but this place put on a clinic super bowl sunday.  By 10 am their line was wrapped around the building...they were organized, had a process and seated folks pretty quickly.",

    "text": "I decided to try this place after walking past it a few times on my previous visits to west gate. Your given a hand buzzer to alert you when your table is ready, which is great when there is a long wait. This particular night was cold, and we requested to not be seated by a door; the opposite was done, so the dinning experience was uncomfortable :(  I ordered the four cheese pizza, and had spinach added to it. Overall the taste was okay.. My drink was delicious {cherry limeade}, alcoholic drink, and sadly the best part of my meal and experience. The other person I was dining with ordered a coke, and it was flat and, not so great in taste. After getting it switched out two times, he just gave up and had water with his meal.  Our waiter was great, checked in to see if everything was good. Will I be back in to dine again, probably not, based off of my experience; but I do recommend the cherry limeade drink!  #ilovegoodfood",

    "text": "Our last night in town for the Phoenix Comicon Fan Fest we decided to splurge a bit and go to the Yard House. We'd been eating on the cheap for most of the trip because when you go to a comic book convention you want to spend most of your money on silly crap you don't need, not food. But I'd been craving a good beer or two the whole time and the Yard House is a great place to go for that.   This location is right in the upscale shopping area near the stadium. You know things aren't going to be cheap just by the decor. We had tried going here on Saturday night but there was a hockey game going on and it was absolutely packed. I can't imagine what it's going to be like for the Superbowl. Things looked busy on Sunday but we had no trouble getting seated right away.   I got a burger and my girlfriend got some kind of chicken sandwich. The food is a bit pricey and a little on the greasy side but it is good. We also got chips and guacamole. The guacamole was freshly made which is always cool (until you make guacamole yourself and realize it's not exactly rocket science, then your appreciation for guacamole preparation goes down a bit) but they gave us a giant heap of the green stuff and seriously like a dozen tortilla chips. Yes, it was the cheapest appetizer on the menu but come on. They aren't made of gold.   The main reason to go to the Yard House is the amazing beer selection and in that area they didn't let us down. My girlfriend got a shorty of cider and she said it was great. I wasn't driving so I got some porter with vanilla bean in it (I couldn't taste any vanilla but I liked it) and something that I think was called La Trappe Quadruple. I got it because I saw it on the lighted sign over the bar and it said it had 10 percent alcohol by volume. Yes, that is entirely the reason I ordered it because that is a crazy amount of alcohol for a beer. It was some kind of quadruple bock I think and if you've ever had them they don't really taste like beer at all. I don't know how to explain the taste. It's like if you could drink flowers made out of booze. I challenge anybody to drink more than one of those and not get alcohol poisoning.   The Yard House is good and I'd give it three and a half stars if I could. Four stars for the beers but minus one for the overpriced bar food. All my reviews have been four stars so far so I've got to give something lower to balance things out. Sorry about that, Yard House.",

I can say, first experience aside the food was excellent however, the level of customer service, promptness, attentiveness not so much. Cocktail prices are high and location is extremely busy on weekends. For being such a large establishment we were informed they only had one side that was cool and being we live in the dessert where summer temperatures can easily soar beyond 100 degrees. You can tell where I am going with this, we got the not so cool side. Hot actually, couldn't wait to get out of there. I greatly appreciate the managers attempt to reconcile the situation but, I don't believe this place would be my first choice in dining options. I do have to give management an A for effort.",

If you plan to come here pre-game, be prepared for a long wait.  We average 30-45 min every time we come here before a game.  What can I say about Yard House that hasn't already been said?  I love their Beer selection and food.  My favorite dish is of course the Sliders ($10.85).  When they have it, I get the Green Flash IPA ($7) to wash it down.  Overall, it's a great place to be just before a Coyotes game.  Return Factor - 90%",

They are not kidding when they say they have a lot of beers on tap - but the beer menu is very well organized and has some really cool and interesting stuff. The food menu is likewise expansive, but we all found something that we liked. Very solid choice in Westgate, especially if you have a group",

Well... on a personal note... I don't know about you... but I would totally buy the 6pack and just suck it down... but that's just me.  ;-)  So I tried the Smithwicks. Oddly enough, as a beer lover, I didn't even realize this stuff is readily available at local places, like Fry's.  Very good amber beer.  I also tried the Firestone union station ipa... to me, you can't go wrong with an IPA.  I had the orange peel chicken which was very sweet but nicely flavored other than that.   Server was cool and friendly.  It was nice to sit outside with the heaters and everything and just people watch.  It's a calming spot after a hard week.",

NHL Channel on at all times?  Check.  Well ok, most don't care about this but being a hockey nut no places have this.  Maybe none of the above is amazing (other than the beer selection).   Maybe it is a bit expensive for a cheapskate like me (I go during happy hour and find it still to be a bit pricey).   Maybe parking is a pain if you go for an event.   Maybe it takes a bit longer to get food as its normally pretty busy.  I don't care.  Stop your whining, pony up 2 dollars and get yourself a couple of Big Macs.  On a more serious note one of the upper managers was around and noticed I was wearing my Wings jersey and bought both my wife and I drinks; he also happened to go to the same community college as I did in Michigan.  Go figure.  I'd recommend the Onion Ring tower, sliders, Mushroom wraps, and spinach dip for appetizers (in that order).  The sweet potato fries with maple dip are all kinds of tasty for a bar treat.",

    "text": "I write this with a lot of frustration. I have NEVER posted on Yelp for two reasons one- I am not a  big complainer and two- I really don't have much time. I slept on this overnight and woke up still extremely frustrated with my overall experience at the Westgate location Yesterday Tuesday 3/14.   We arrived at the Yard House at 4:21 pm. We were seated right away, it was Happy Hour and my wife and two Children were exited. The waiter who I understand may have been busy took 15 minutes just to acknowledge us, then says, he will be right back he has to take an order for another table and he'll be right with us. Not only did we wait patiently we allowed him to take the order then took another order for a table that was seated 15-17 minutes after we had already been there and still couldn't get a water... Now, I am getting frustrated I told him we already knew everything we wanted to order and also advised that we were seated long before the other table had gotten there. He did apologize and said he would put our order in first.   After another 10 minutes and still no drinks I decided to walk up to the front and let someone know If someone could get us our drinks, my kids are younger and here we are at 4:51 with nothing to drink one of the Hostessess said she would let the Manager know and they will make it right another waiter came up and said those same words that the Manager will make it right. I was excited to hear that the care so much and said all the right things. At that time when they are walking back with me the drinks finally came. I said that's the table and she said ok, A manager will be there shortly.   After the drinks came everything started coming out. Calamari came out with a Chicken finger on the plate and soggy chicken wings. Now at this point the waiter started delivering more plates, the manager came to assist him but never addressed the concerns nor did he say he was the manager just didn't seem like he really cared. He didn't say he was the manager but I knew he was based off the hostess going up to advise him of the situation, I thought under the circumstances he would've asked us or apologized about the overall experience. He didn't apologize He just said is everything ok?  I said now it's fine but he also had the waiter with him and I didn't want to light him up in front of his manager after already telling the waiter to his face. I was very surprised when the bill was full price with not even the tea or soda covered at this point I was over it with The Yard House. I paid the bill and instead of tipping the gentleman my normal 20% I gave him 10% even though he deserved 0%. That kind of tells you a little about my character.   Take my money and give me a terrible experience but I will never go there again!  Moses L.",

I had the guacamole and chips and the southern fried chicken entree and a side Guacamole  is guacamole but it had good flavor. The Southern Fried Chicken as a complete dish I wasnt a fan of. The components however was great. The fried chicken was crispy and moist and the bourbon gravy has great flavor. The pinto beans were spicy and they had a smokey flavor. The creamed corn was made with fresh corn and was really smooth. The (spinach) mashed potatoes lacked spinach but was buttery and so good!!.I was also a hearty portion. Overall a great experience!!!",

The food was great either that or we were starving. I had an order of deviled eggs and it never came with our entree. We also specified to them to bring everything out as it done. They changed servers on us once the food came then I informed them about the deviled eggs, they said they were whipping them. Ok, it should take only a few minutes. 30 more minutes pass, we were done with our food and they said they were still working on it???? Just say you forgot to enter it in. Finally got them after we got the check. They were good just ridiculous how long it took.",

We've usually avoided this location on game night since the 30-45 min waits rarely fit in with our plans.This Saturday ,Mar14th ,we made a deliberate attempt to get in , waited 30 mins. Got in around 1800, game starts 1900 . The appetizer, entree and drinks were pretty good but we had 2 1/2 yard drinks  which made it hard to have the plate right in front of us.     1/2 a burger and 1/2 the fries are just swept up by the staff. No attempt to verify our intentions just whoosh.  Server Aimee was apologetic and would have gotten us replacement fries ( no burger seemingly) or the manager but we had a game to get to that would have been disrupted by either offer. The $80 check for two people has to come with a degree of care and attention that weren't obvious.  So the food is certainly worth a 3.5 , but I can't recall the last time we had our plates taken with such \"reckless efficiency\"  Update: Have received a $25  certificate for this process and will  put it towards another outing( probably at another  of their locations).   Update 2:  Actually we reconsidered it and decided that  this was a poor attempt to resolve a situation that shouldn't have occurred. It's off our list.",

We had to wait about an hour for our table.  Only gripe about the wait...I'm a football fan and a Fantasy owner...we stood outside, so I had to keep going in to check out the games on tv.  If you are interested in watching the games the entire time you are in a restaurant, the New Yorker is the place.  They typically aren't as busy in the restaurant side a couple hours before the game and they have tons of tvs.  Food at the New Yorker is not as good as The Yardhouse.  Hubbie and I split the french onion soup and it was tasty.  Lots of cheese and I liked dipping the sourdough bread on the side.  I got the cajun chicken ceasar salad and it had a nice kick to it.  The Yardhouse dressing is egg-less and still pretty tasty.  It was an ok ceasar.  Hubbie got the club sandwich and liked it.  The fries are more shoestring, and have that burger king coating on them, making them more tasty...but I would prefer no coating.  Son liked his sliders.  His girlfriend got the brownie dessert since she had eaten already.  It was huge and sweet.  We got into the stadium in time to watch the opening kick-off as we climbed to our seats.  Best of the entire day...Cards clinched the NFC West Division title.  Yay!",

Noticed it was not busy as the other restaurants in the area and definitely not like the Yardhouse I'm used to which always has a wait.  The food was pretty bad. I ordered lettuce wraps (I get every time) which weren't very appetizing, and the lettuce was old and brown. My mom ordered a turkey burger which we specified to the server she wanted it cooked very well (as turkey burgers should always be fully cooked thru). The burger came out still pink in the middle. She asked to just get the regular avocado swiss burger. The wait was very long for the new burger and it came without avocado and swiss. My salad was also pretty disappointing.  Our server Adam was nice and attentive and the only reason I give this high of a rating is for the manager Melissa. I have been in the restaurant industry many years and she was very nice and handled the situation in the correct manner. Would probably not go back for the food but maybe just for drinks as they have many of my favorite ciders.",

It's a ripoff the rest of the time. Get there early and get your fill of tasty beers and appetizers. This is an excellent choice before catching a concert next door.   They have Rogue Hazelnut Brown and Chimay on tap, and 120+ more. Try the Hawaiian poke stack.  That is all.",

If we are at Westgate for some unknown reason, we will usually choose this place over the other offerings in the plaza.  The Happy Hour here is usually pretty decent, with a fairly large offering of appetizers for cheap and cheap martinis as well.  Always a good thing.  I've had a couple different things from the menu here and I have always been happy with my selections.  I have had the Beef Dip sandwich and it is quite tasty.  However, if you are looking for really thinly sliced beef, do not get this sandwich because they slice it rather thick.  I have also ordered their Mac and Cheese here and it was delicious.  A good standby.    If you are looking for gourmet food, don't come here because that's not what you will get.  If you are looking for traditional but yummy food then this is a good place to try.  Overall, a great place to eat, talk, and drink.  Doesn't get better than that.",

Service & food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley, but this location is a little less rowdy (which I consider a plus).  Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.  Prices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for Spinach dip, etc.  Kona coffee ice cream dessert and homemade brownie are nice desserts.",

    "text": "After seeing Sarah Brightman at Jobing Dot Com Arena I was still in the mood for dessert. (See my Gordon Biersch review.)  I walked through the Westgate Center after the show and decided to give Yard House a try. Perused the menu outside and decided that the desserts looked good.  Went in and was promptly seated at a nice big booth for just one person. The hostess asked if I'd ever been there before and I told her no. She briefly explained the menu for me.   When the server arrived he also asked if I'd ever been there before. I told him no and he went over the menu again. I didn't want him wasting his time so I told him I was just interested in dessert. He pointed out the dessert section and I asked him if he recommended the 'pint-sized apple peach cobbler.' He said he did but warned me it was small....hence the 'pint-sized' disclaimer. I thought that was cool....some menus say 'pint-sized' but he wanted to make sure I understood they meant it. Honesty goes a long way with me.  I said that was fine....that's all I wanted and really needed. He asked if I wanted anything to drink and I told him I'd look over the HUGE beer list.   When he came back I asked him his preference between two beers. I took his suggestion with the Murphy's Irish Red and really enjoyed it.   The 'pint-sized' cobbler was small...as he had warned...but it was tasty. The caramel ice cream it was served with was a welcome touch over the traditional vanilla.  Beer and a cobbler.....strange, I know.....but it worked.   The ambiance of the place was casual and laid back with lots of televisions everywhere and lots of classic rock (like their slogan says).  Would like to try some of the food next time I'm in the Westgate area.   Oh.....the sinks in the men's room were awesome. Or I guess I should say sink in the singular. It was a long trough with three or four 'spigots'. You put your hand up to the 'spigot' and a STRONG stream of water about two or three inches wide came out.  Made washing your hands pretty darn cool. It's the first time in a LONG time that I've felt I got all the soap off my hands in a public restroom.  A great and relaxing end to my evening out. Will be back.",

It SO good - BUT, last time I ordered it I got a nice surprise, a bacon inside of it. I brought it to the waitresses attention and she replaced my salad. The manager came out and apologized. I figured they wouldn't charge me for it, but, they did. I just thought it was odd. Any other place I have gone to wouldn't have even charged me for it. I mean, am I wrong here? I don't know.

The app and drink specials are good.  We've been here a few times and feel so-so about it.  We were looking for a cheap HH close to home so we went to try some new things.  Upon walking in, we saw a couple sitting outside with a little wooden stand holding 6 samples.  We asked our waiter about it and it's their \"six pack\" which contains six samples pre-chosen by them for about $9.  We tried it and I liked more of them than my husband as he generally likes lighter beers and I tend to like amber ales.  I would order it again - it's fun to mix it up and try some new beers and ciders.  Plus, they give you a sheet with the name, origin, and brewery of each selection.  I asked for two samples of other beers and my husband asked for one.  We didn't really care enough for them to order a pint.    We also had the egg rolls and jerk wings.  The egg rolls were good, but not great and the wings were a little disappointing.  You know what's even more disappointing?  Getting the bill and seeing a $1 charge for each sample that we asked for.  Seriously?  For a few sips to try them out before ordering a whole pint which would have been in the ballpark of $3?  Our server didn't even mention it when we ordered them.  It's really just the principle.  Not cool Yard House!  They should take a lesson from Papago Brewing where they gladly will give you a free sample to help you decide on a brew.",

Were we in Las Vegas?  Ooh wait...its Glendale...  There was a 10-15 minute wait so we headed to the bar!  120 beers on tap!  HUGE!  My favorite bar in Ann Arbor Michigan-Ashley's-only has 70 beers on tap so I was very very excited to read about all 120.  Sadly the menu gave very little description of the brews and although the bartenders may have had answers it was difficult enough to get their attention let alone ask about the beers.  Thankfully the Pistons were playing on all bazillion of their flat screens so I wasn't too upset.  I went with a raspberry cider (I'm normally not THAT girly) and my man went with a Boddingtons.  After the first sip the buzzer went off and we were seated.  Our server was adorable and knew a whole lot about the menu.  I went with a BBQ chicken salad (shocker) that was divine yet I am sure was no where near as healthy as I would like liked.  Brian went with the french onion soup and a Bearnaise burger which he enjoyed.   Food-4 stars Beer- 4 stars Bar service-3 stars Table service-5 stars Entertainment-5 stars...GO PISTONS!  Will I be back? Ehh...seems like quite a few other spots to check out in that area before returning but it's a great sports bar type scene.",

I love their chicken nachos, being someone who hates nachos, that says a lot. There is no liquid cheese involved! It's a heap of grilled chicken, beans, sour cream, guacamole, fresh shredded cheese that's melted, on chips. I also love their turkey club. The bread is perfectly toasted, turkey is juicy, bacon is crispy, and avacado is creamy. Their garlic parmesan fries are to die for. I did not care too much for their pizza though, had the margarita and I've had better. Service is always good and the ambiance is nice.",

Food: - Grilled artichoke appetizer was $9.75. The chips were great. Loved the dip. But only 1 artichoke head split in 1/2? For over $9 at least put 2 on the plate. - Parmesan crusted chicken was $16.95. They stack 2 pieces of chicken on top garlic mashed potatoes & the whole thing is surrounded by sauce with mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes.  Drinks: - My friend got a red or black velvet. I think it was red. It was fruity & smokey. Not my style but he liked it. About $5. - My other friend got some cherry beer. It was sweet & very cherry flavored. Again, not my style but of course he liked it. About $5. - My friends then got some kind of orange beer with added slices of orange. I really liked this 1. Very tasty. They told me it's from a brewery out in Scottsdale. I remember my friend saying this 1 cost only about $3 - I drank a pomegranate mojito. It was good & there was plenty of mint. Mojitos make me feel like I'm drinking Listerine or gum. If I remember correctly this was over $8. - I also got a margarita. Pretty sour but I always love them like that.   The music was good. Is there really a jukebox? I didn't see 1...  Our bartender, Jason was friendly & helpful. He changed the channel for me when I asked. There are tons of tv's there! I have to say I did feel a little pressured to order a drink right away though. I like to take some time to look at the menu. Please don't jump down my throat & keep asking me to order a drink.  The bathrooms were plenty clean. The faucet on the left didn't want to work though. Even the girl working there who was straightening up admitted it's temperamental. I do like their sink once it works though.  Also, I think it's pretty cool that you can see the chefs working off to the side.  Read in 1 review about wrist bands. We were only carded 1 time & there were no wrist bands.  I really need to come back & try a desert. They sound like they'll be really yummy.",

Hockey game scheduled for the night we head out there. So busier then normal. Probably made for a better experience   We put our name in and wait 20 minutes for first available. We get seated and it's a little warm in the restaurant. Warmer then usual. A little uncomfortable but we try and adjust. Drinks are ordered. I love, love the Peach cider. Hubby had a Hoegaarden. Step dad tried something @ the suggestion of our server Mike. Mom had glass of white zin. An order of cold edamame is also plugged in and we are off.   We chat some and the edamame comes out. Cools us off. Mike comes and takes our order. Hubby had the steak salad, I ordered the Cuban pork sandwich, mom order surf and turf burger, step dad orders a Greek salad and adds ahi to it.   Everything comes out looking fantastic. The salad my hubby ordered the steak was cooked perfectly for him. I will from this moment on every time we go there get the pork sandwich. Tons of sliced pork, pickles, tomatoes, aioli and garlic au jus. Shoestring french frys accompany my order. Mom's surf and turf looks to die for. The Greek salad was a little on the small side but the ahi looked perfectly seared.   Everything was delish. I think the ladies won the night with what we ordered. It was so good. We missed happy hour prices by 15 minutes so the tab was a little steep for the four of us. $120 plus tip.   Had my mom taste test the Frambroise. So good. She wanted to order vanilla ice cream and put the shot all over it. :)",

For all the shortcomings, the number of high-quality beers and tasty food has my review eternally pegged at five stars.  So let's talk about what I don't like. Prices. I know I've said it twice but it is the only reason we don't visit more often. We once had an appetizer come out unforgiveably dirty. But it didn't bother us because once we told our waiter no less than two servers and a manager came to apologize. If they make a mistake, they more than compensate and obviously care a great deal about customer service.  Here are some of the other things I like. The turkey burger is to die for. We've ordered it twice and will probably order it every second or third time we visit. The fries are tasty, crispy, and wonderful but because they are thin the temp drops quickly. We try to eat the fries before the burger, but it's difficult because the burger is just so darn tasty.  My wife isn't crazy about the pizzas. I would order them again although I will never say it is the best pizza I've ever tried. I think we've only tried cheese, pepperoni, and bbq.  But the turkey pot pie? The mac and cheese (with chicken and bacon, their top seller)? The Maui chicken? The Avocado Swiss burger? Yeah, those are the best I've ever had. Here are some more details: pot pie is huge, covered with the tastiest, flakiest, croissant crust imaginable. The mac and cheese is legendary, a must try. The Avocado Swiss burger was juicy, had half of an avocado, and the creamiest of swiss cheeses. What I liked about the Maui chicken was that it was prepared, not thrown together. The vegetables were really cooked in a delicious sauce, and instead of drowning in sauce they were imbibed with it. Just perfection.  Obviously we will be going again. Love it. Can't get enough.",

I can't go without gorging. I happily order three or four dishes, just because I can't decide.   Yes, I'm raving. Yes, hyperbole is never attractive. Yes, it's just that good.  First, a warning: Alphabetically working your way through all 100+ draft beers may sound like a good idea. All of my friends and I have independently decided that this is a briliant plan. It is not. Man was not meant to sample that much beer.  The menu could go toe-to-toe with War and Peace. It's epic. It will shatter any prejudice you may have had about restaurants that lack a focused menu. It has executed every meal perfectly. Perfectly.  The service is top-notch. I've tried to hire away a few of them to work in sales (none of them took the offer, which just goes to show they're smart, too).  I'm really stretching to find the negatives. On the weekends, there's a long wait. The servers don't know beer very well, but usually have a few recommendations. They turn the music up too loud after 11PM or so.",

    "text": "OK first of all, Glendale/Peoria is a wasteland of chain eateries and overrated strip mall joints. We have spent many weeks in the area (usually for sporting events) and eaten out 50+ times at virtually every place that serves food. Being generous, the food choices and quality is very limited in the area. If you eat burgers, you will not starve, but you need to lower your expectations if you are from out of the area.  Having said that, the Yard House is one of the few \"chain\" places that offers a diverse menu, great refreshments and good service. The 80's music and tall \"yard\" beer glasses offer a signature touch and the place is usually packed so that has to be a good sign. Overall, this is one of the better places in the area, albeit on an adjusted scale. Can't go wrong with the burgers, beer and apps, but the farther you get away from this \"sweet spot\",the dicier the food gets. Overall, not a bad call, just not anything special.",

With 2%-10% alcohol by volume! Definitely a fan. Went the second time to actually eat and was definitely impressed again! Their menu has a great big variety and tastes great! Super big fan!

They have an early one during normal times and another that starts at 10pm, Sunday through Thursday.  The pizza was excellent in both size and flavor.  I went back the next night as well and ordered their spicy tuna roll based on a customer recommendation from the previous night.  It too was outstanding.  Served with edamame, cucumber, and seaweed in the bottom layer, seared and raw tuna in the middle layer, and avocado on the top layer.  Sprinkled with some hot sauce, it was filling, light, and nutritious.  The price was around $12 though it is 1/2 price if you get it during happy hour!",

(they live in Buckeye) so it was a lil drive to get here. But it was well worth it. It was pretty busy and surprisingly the wait was about five minutes until we were seated. It was so nice to get out of the heat. the booth was large and comfortable, of course they are known for the wide variety of draft beers over 100 i believe, (WOW) I just went with a beer i was familiar with shock top, i got a half yard of that. My waitress, I wish I remembered her name she was so awesome. so helpful with the menu, and making recommendations, very sweet and funny. very attentive, Her plus the food made this place an automatic favorite for me. While im aware there is a yardhouse in San Diego this was my first time trying it out. I got the Southern fried Chicken with the spinach and corn mashed potatoes, im not be exaggerating but this dish was beyond amazing, soooo soooo delicious. all the combinations of flavor were everything. definite favorite. YOU MUST TRY THIS !! I really enjoyed this restaurant and the sports like atmosphere is awesome. It was so good that I came back the very next day. My waiter was so kind as I expected and happened to be from San Diego As well , this time I got the halibut with asparagus and spinach mashed potatoes, another delicious meal. service was good. Thank you all for the amazing experience and That chef really knows what theyre doing !!",

She was attentive, friendly, and didn't mind that we took 20 minutes or so to order since we were all chatting. She was overall a great server! The food was okay. My sister ordered some kind of pasta with lobster which she loved. However, I ordered the ginger crusted salmon which I was excited about but the salmon was very dry and over cooked. I barely ate any of it.  I'm only giving three stars because our appetizer (calamari) was completely forgotten and never came to the table and the food was subpar. This is the second time I've been in a row that I haven't been pleased by the food and for the price they charge I should walk away satisfied.",

We asked the hostess what was taking so long for our table since we actually watched the wait staff clear the table we were to sit at, and the hostess explained that the manager decided to not sit any patrons until the cooks could catch up with the food orders that were backed up. Our total wait time was approximately 45 minutes.    All not bad since we had a wonderful wait staff member named Chelsea, who made everything great. Her positive attitude made our evening delightful. The food was good, our drinks were good...all was good even though it started out questionably.

    "text": "I would like to start this review by saying I am a server myself and I typically love going to Yard house. But this evenings experience was quite terrible.  We were greeted by our waitress, Suzy. She was seemingly upset to be working and was not happy or enthused when arriving to the table. She took roughly 15-20 minutes to get everyone's drinks to the table, our party being of 6 people. All 6 drinks drinks were dropped off at separate times by separate servers. Though a bothersome, we tried to be understanding. We ordered the Lobster spinach and artichoke dip (absolute must, completely incredible). We had to wait quite a bit of time to order, but once we did, our party ordered two salads to come out before the meals. Our salads arrived roughly 20 minutes after our dinners and were entirely wrong with toppings and dressings. It took Suzy and an additional server Bianca until the end of our meal to get us the correct salad. The orange chicken, Mac and cheese meal, and chicken and noodle bowl were all delicious and hot despite taking so long to arrive. Unfortunately when asking very politely to fix the issue, Suzy argued that we got exactly what we ordered and that we were in the wrong. I got one refill the entire two hours we were there, and didn't see her refill any water or sodas. Any other bar drinks sat in the well at the bar for 10-20 minutes before they were brought to the table.   As the meal was ending and we were looking for dessert, the girls dropped of our checks with out us even asking for them, not offering dessert. On our check we paid for the salads and meals that were wrong and late.  Being a server at a top 100 restaurant in the nation on Yelp, I always serve to the best of my abilities with a smile and take care of any meals that went wrong. On top of that we almost always order a dessert on the house for any inconvenience. Suzy was unwilling to help, service was horribly slow, and we were treated as an inconvenience.   YardHouse: Food is incredible! Drinks are so tasty and potent! Service absolutely sucked.",

I had the Spicy Jambalaya and my husband had a burger. We both really enjoyed our meals. I docked two stars because my husband puked out all of his food this morning at 2AM - he's thinking maybe the burger wasn't cooked well enough. It was REALLY pink. Another star off because - even with happy hour - my (house) vodka cranberries were $10 each. That's pretty pricey.",

Plus I love that it's in the Westgate Entertainment center, so great atmosphere. The service is good.   I love the lobster and spinach artichoke dip it is truly something special. As an entree I usually get the vodka shrimp pasta yum! I guess if I had to find opportunities of improvement, it would be to expand the menu. But in actuality. I really like it here a lot!",

With a drink, the meal is moderately priced at about $18 with tip.  Knocks are the overall lags between ordering, getting food, getting check(s), and getting payment receipts back.  It has never taken less than an 1:40.  Staff is really nice, but they really need to tighten their game up.  Noise can be an issue as you'll likely be hoarse when you leave-- you don't notice how much you yell to talk to the people around you.  The place also has more appeal if you like a sports bar setting.  I'll give them four stars instead of three when they learn to shorten turnarounds.  Regardless, it's a good option for tasty food if you have the time to spare.",

It's not like he was swamped. The restaurant only had about a half-dozen tables occupied and he didn't have but one besides us.  My friend had the Korean BBQ Beef which had more fat than edible beef.  I had the Enchilada Stack, which was okay but definitely not worth the $16.75 they get for it.  It's too bad because the atmosphere is very business friendly, too bad the food and service are so poor.",

I went with a cheeseburger, fries, Dr. Pepper and french onion soup.  It came out really good, and I had a really good time here. I wish I would have been able to get something to drink, but I felt like noon was a bit to early to start drinking, plus, I didn't have anyone to drive me home, so I passed on getting an adult beverage.  I love how this place doesn't feel like a traditional bar. It's nicely decorated, and the service is always wonderful.  They offer patio seating here as well, and I wish I was closer to a yardhouse as I would probably spend more time here enjoying their huge alcohol selection.  This place is worth the shot, and I always have a really good time when I come here.",

Now I'm having to give it 2 stars. Our last 3 trips to this location have just been awful. The first of our awful trips we both got the Surf and Turf burger. I ordered mine medium and she ordered hers medium rare. Both came crispy and far from pink. Needless to say we sent them back. I got mine first somehow and waited for hers to come thinking it would be any second. It wasn't...by the time she got hers mine was cold! Making a long story short I complained to head quarters and we received a gift card to go back and try it again. We did and unfortunately it was the same experience with different food. We went through the whole process yet again and gave it one last try...I'm sorry to say other than going for the beer selection I won't be eating at that location any longer. Something happened there and the food has just gotten terrible. I really hope they fix this because it really was one of our favorite places to go and it is close to home.",

Weeks ago, while having dinner and a few drinks at the Yardhouse....I began to realize that the  Yardhouse bills itself as a restaurant.  It also, heavily promotes itself as a bar.  I feel that the atmosphere is a bit confusing.  What's more,  if you want to have a conversation with the folks you're dining with, this is not the place for you, especially during a Friday or Saturday night.  It is chaos!!  Most of the servers seem nice and knowledgeable however, I found myself being privy to a conversation between a manager and an employee that I had no business hearing.. Our table was very close and within ear shot of one of the stations servers use to input food.  This manager raised his voice loud enough (in anger) for it to rise above even the music.  Unacceptable!!!  What's more, there seemed to be enough managers there for two businesses. 'Further, this particular employee seemed pretty upset about it but, she kept on working.....hmmmmmm....not sure what happened there but, Yardhouse.....I won't be coming back.  I want to enjoy the food and the sports.....the yelling at employees and loud music, I can do without.  BJ's, much more relaxed atmosphere, you can watch sports and the food is delicious.",

    "text": "We discovered this place when we drove over to see how the Margaritaville Glendale construction was going. What a sweet find! First impression is that it's so comfortable and inviting looking! There is great seating on the outside patio with really comfortable chairs, and the seating inside is also very comfortable. You notice the many, MANY, tap handles that circumvent the bar! I tried the Lost Coast Great White specifically because of the very cool tap handle! I was not disappointed! The music playing is awesome and really sets the atmosphere. How I wish there was a Yard House in the East Valley as it would be a great place to meet with friends on a very regular basis. The food-WOW FACTOR OF 10. I have the same thing when I eat there as it is unbelievably good! The Jerk Chicken with Shrimp Stack. Such delectable mouth watering goodness!!! The waitstaff have always been so friendly. We haven't had long waits any of the times we've been there.",

    "text": "I was let down to find out there was no yard inside the Yard House at Westgate but it was still a good time.  I came here last night with my family for my Wife & son's birthday.  We started off with a California roll & artichoke for appetizers.  We weren't too impressed with either but ate most of it, the roll was a gigantic piece of sushi packed with rice (should have taken a picture) so it was not the kind of roll you pick up with chop sticks.  The artichoke didn't seemed cooked all the way but most of it was pretty good.  Then I ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it was pretty good and I had a cup of the white chicken tortilla soup and that was the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the shrimp Caesar salad and a shrimp enchilada stack and everyone seemed to enjoyed it.   The atmosphere is great here with 2 beautiful patio areas and the bar inside has what looks like is about 100 draft beer selections, several flat screen TVs throughout.  The booths and table are very comfortable and the whole place has a nice dark warm feeling, great date place for dinner then grab a movie or show nearby.  We went out of our way to eat here for a reason, it is consistently great food, great service, & great atmosphere.",

    "text": "First of all, I have to give our server Rejeana five stars for herself.  Within two minutes of being seated she appeared, a petite, bubbly and very informative young lady. She gave a very clear explanation of the beers, and menu and also asked if we were going to the game, since it was close to starting time.  We were not, but we're impressed that she would inquire.  Our drinks and meals appeared quickly even though the restaurant was quickly filling up.  Every time Rejeana passed our table she checked on us. To start with we ordered the crab, lobster, artichoke dip which was excellent.  There were four of us, I ordered the Mac and cheese and a ranch salad.  The salad was fresh and of a good size for an appetizer salad and my adult Mac and cheese was saucy with plenty of chicken, bacon and mushrooms.  I will enjoy the leftovers.  It was delicious.  Another tried the pepperoni pizza which he said was equally as good as any he had had.  He also enjoyed his caesar salad.  One had the clam chowder, yum, with the fish and chips which was a very large order.  He totally enjoyed it.  And the fourth of our party had the tomato bisque which she said was the best she had ever tasted, and also had an order of the crab cakes which she totally enjoyed.  Two of us are foodies  from the Napa Valley in California and we are very spoiled with five star restaurants surrounding us.  The food we enjoyed  at your restaurant this evening was equal to what we enjoy at home.  Kudos to you!",

    "text": "120 beers on the tap, 120 beers, take one down, gulp it down, 119 beers on the tap...you get the idea. The Yard House IS beer. But they also have 24 appetizers. 14 different starter salads and soups. Oodles and scads of burgers and sandwiches. Endless lists of steak and house specialty entrees. It makes The Cheesecake Factory menu look like a freakin' pamphlet. We arrived with a group of nine and were greated and seated by a friendly host staff. We opted for a table over a booth, cuz I ain't gonna be the bastard squished in the middle, drinking beer and having to get out 3 or 4 times to pee. We had just come from the Shamrock Foods show at the U of P stadium and had grazed on all things fried and anything you can stick a party toothpick in. So I was ready for a black and tan and perhaps a salad. Black and tan, both of them, went down quickly. I ordered the turkey cobb salad. And I got exactly that. Turkey was a tad dry, of course, when isn't it, and at $13.45, kinda pricey. Others had the mac n cheese, which was overwhelmed by the mushrooms. A BBQ chicken salad, that was, described as \"Meh\" (and no I was not with Pierre)...apparently though \"Meh\" is catching on like my current year motto \"Make it great in 08\"...well at least mine rhymes. Best dish on the table, not at the table, cuz that woulda been moi, but best dish on the table was a Korean rib appetizer. Server Christa was fantastic although frustrated as the runners delivered our meals and \"auctioned\" them off even though she had ordered them by position number. Music was all things 70s and 80s...The Outfield! What the hell happened to them?Located in Glendale this House is not in my back yard and that's OK with me.",

    "text": "I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, even upscale ones like the Yard House. However, I am a fan of the Yard House, and here's why: First, the beer selection; if you're a fan of craft beers like I am, you will appreciate the dozens of craft beer offerings, many of which I have never tried. The Bear Republic IPA was my favorite of the night. Second, the menu is interesting and the food flavorful. I had egg rolls and lettuce wraps; both were in Asian-fusion style and wonderfully flavored. Third, though some reviewers have complained about price, for Monday Night Football they have all-night happy hour, with half-priced beer, appetizers and pizza. You can order appetizers and eat Tapas style while you watch the game from a large number of big screens. With beers, my bill was only $25. Lastly, the service was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and quick. How many places have a waitress that can and will talk about the relative merits of craft beers, suggest one over another, give you just long enough to decide then come back to take your order?  Sandra, you rock!",

    "text": "I really liked the food here.  Being the only vegetarian in a group of people looking for a decent place to eat on a Friday night can leave you feeling a little guilty (or if the people you're with are just jerks, can really make you feel like crap), so finding a place that offers great food in addition to great vegetarian food was a win.  Oh, yeah, the their bar is pretty stellar (try the raspberry cider).  Only one person in our group actually ended up ordering anything with meat in it, as their vegetarian menu was just too appealing.  I was happy to see so many options, but a little bummed that they seemed to rely on Gardein products (which I love, don't get me wrong, it'd just be nice to see some variety, or even some creativity from restaurants when it comes to meat \"alternatives\").  I went with the Orange Peel 'Chicken' with a tomato soup to start, my boyfriend got the Sliders, and our table mates ordered a rather awesome looking salad with French Onion Soup and some tacos, respectively.  Everything was delicious, and I look forward to visiting again.  The only real downside here, for me anyway, was how crowded the restaurant was (I know, my bad for going on a Friday night), and because of the volume of people, the volume on the noise seemed to be increased, too.  We were lucky to be in a corner away from most of the hubbub, but it was still rather unpleasant.  If they could figure out a way to reduce the noise (not too hard to do, actually), rework the dining area so it allows for more fluid movement with out the congestion, and maybe be a little closer (clearly this last bit is not a 'must'), they would easily get 5 stars from me.",

Well the selection is better compared to other restaurants in the chain (especially in the way of IPA's) and the servers and bartenders seem to be misplaced beer nerds stuck in a beer desert. There isn't much i found appealing about the Phoenix area beer scene, so for a hop head residing in the area I would suppose that Yardhouse is one of the few beer hot spots. The food is better. The pizzas here seem to be of a higher quality. The BBQ chicken pizza was AWESOME! Totally in love with it after a pint or...four.  Huge douchebag clientele though. Popped collars and platinum blondes galore. I left my Ralph Lauren at home and got shot some pretty serious stares. If you live in Phoenix or are a brew fanatic like me who's passing through this is an oasis in the hot, beer deprived desert.",

And I'm sure it's both, but unfortunately, my one visit (so far) wasn't to pick a \"high-end\" chain or to partake in alcohol. Maybe, when I have a DD and when I have some a little more well-off than, well, me paying the tab.  This is not to say this wasn't a good place, it's just that I might not have the best view of what it's supposedly known for. Regardless, I will do my best with what I observed.  I met a old college buddy that I haven't seen in 16-17 years - hey now, I'm really not that old - and while at Westgate, I blindly picked this place, not knowing ANYTHING about it. We had a blast. The waitress was wonderful - she let us sit there for practically 3 hours chatting, or catching up, that is. Granted it was a Monday night, football night and the restaurant was 80% empty. Still, I appreciate someone not pushing me out the door - like when I do, in fact, have too many beers. :-)  I digress, we both had iced tea and they apparently have multiple varieties. I'm a non-conservative old-fashioned mate who simply must stick with regular tea. In addition, I ordered a pizza. Very affordable and equally delicious.  I'm not a big eater, and even the 10\" pie looked too much to not ask for a doggie bag, or Styrofoam container. Patting myself on the back, I finished it and it was great. Just plain old pep and mush...remember: old-fashioned.  The ambience was nice, big bar, the staff well dressed, mannered and polite. It's a little pricey, but I haven't tried what requires an AMEX Black card yet. I'd recommend it, if you happen to be at Westgate and have some generous buddies or (OTHER.)",

We were enjoining sitting outside as it had finally cooled down enough to pleasantly dine out on the patio.  After our salads arrived, two couples came outside and all lit up cigarettes and were puffing away at us.  Not being used to this, because where we live, there are more healthy and respectful policies, we alerted our server.  She surprisingly informed us that the entire patio was a smoking zone.  Although they quickly moved us inside because this induced my asthma, it was disappointing that they allowed bar patrons to come outside and smoke next to us when this is not typical for most cities in Arizona .  When paying close to $30 per entree, I would expect a lot more class from the Yardhouse or at least a designated smoking section.  We were moved inside by the manager to a table bordering the kitchen and were harassed by staff and other patrons for sitting there.   Ok Yardhouse, get with the times...if CVS can quit smoking, so can you!  Until then, we wont be back!",

We could only assume that it was because of Valentines weekend.  We waited an hour to get seated and placed our order promptly but our patience wore out when the food was taking OVER and hour to get to our table.  I would have left angry had it not been for management that night.  As soon as I brougth it up to them, they took care of our whole table.  They couldn't apologize enough, and made sure we got a discount on our bill.  Due to this I have to commend them...customer service is big with me.  If there is a problem and they step up to take care of it shows that they care about their customers dining experience.  I know my review is really late but it's better late than never! PS....the food was awesome even though it was late to get to us.",

While comical, common sense has to play a part and the waitress should be asking for confirmation I'd that is all she thought I ordered with my beer lol.  Overall, I got comped my lunch by the manager, and enjoyed a nice steak sandwich, which in fact was, a steak on a sandwich.  Delicious.

I have been to this restaurant several times, and have tried various entrees on the menu in multiple locations. If you want to play it safe come during happy hour for pizza and wings.  Only give it a 4/5 because some of the items on the menu I've tried tasted weird. The Mexican food items are on the more \"modern side\" and some of the other entrees I've tried either weren't cooked properly or were bland.  I always come back and try something new. I don't have a favorite entree. I would say I mostly come here for the vibes. The ambiance and music is very laid back and this is a chill place to drink. Furthermore, this place will always have my business.",

Usually a microbrew is that price but not a domestic! Took forever to get our lunch, finally had to ask where it was, not very good food either. Done with that place.",

    "text": "Yard house definitely deserves at least 4 stars.  We chose happy hour egg rolls for our appetizer at the beginning of the meal. The protein was a bit unseasoned but the remaining ingredients kept them highly afloat.  I ordered the surf and turf burger: butterflied lobster atop the patty. The burger was magnificent though cooked well instead of medium well as requested. The lobster atop didn't retain much flavor and took away from the deliciousness of the burger itself. The onion rings were an additional charge ($1) but were well worth the money, having a beautiful not-too-greasy fry.   My wife ordered the Mac and Cheese - most popular item. This was also delicious, but again, the added protein seemed a bit unnecessary. The chicken inside wasn't to die for though the bacon, noodles and sauce were. The side salad she ordered was large in portion and quite tasty as well.   The unsweetened tea was delicious and I don't like unsweetened tea much. It had several floral hints adding a refreshing touch.   The server was friendly and prompt.   Aside from a lack of seasoning in the added proteins I would give 5 stars. The atmosphere was modern slash bar but comfortable for all ages. The booths were large and comfortable as well. The ceiling was lined in brewing pipes. The lighting was perfect.   Our ticket came out to $52 in addition to the  $12 tip.  Definitely worth the money!",

The traditional Caesar salad was perfect... right amount of dressing and not a single soggy leaf. The addition of golden raisins were a pleasant surprise.  Did not care for the spicy tuna roll. It's not a roll. It's more of a cake or sculpture. The tuna was inconsistent in texture. Sent it back. Did not care for the calamari. The red sauce was good. The calamari was bland and overcooked (rubbery). Sent it back.  The manager was super nice. I guess he was concerned when the second dish went back. Gave him my feedback. He offered to pay for another chance. The shitake garlic noodles were delicious. I would definitely order this again.

I can't believe I don't have a review for them. I probably thought I had written one a while ago. At this point I can't remember anything before I joined Yelp back in 2011, I think. But I had been using it prior to that on my brothers phone. Thank goodness for technology.   Anywho, family tradition at Westgate: we eat at Yard House, than right across head to the candy store, than head to La lady, and Just Sports. Than back to the main stage because there's always something going on we go there, let the kids run wild and lastly, head to Coldstone.   So our tradition continued this past Saturday. Although we were too stuffed from candy and dinner to have ice cream.   I love their steak, of course! But today I had the asada Street tacos. They are always delicious.  My daughter always gets the truffle fries, we share them. We also got the queso tortilla appetizer and the guacamole chips appetizer. Everything was delicious as usual.   We will continue to dine here. Great service and great food along with great atmosphere.",

Got home and I forgot to Ask for no cheese but that was a easy fix didn't notice their was cheese on it till I took my first bite. Once I pulled my cheese off I noticed something weird.... IT WAS ANOTHER HAIR!!! AND I ALMOST CONSUMED IT. Grossed me out . So If you want a extra side of hair in your food go to yard house at west gate I'm sure they can fix you something great!",

The menu is huge and has something for everyone. As for the food it is served hot and is delicious. My recommendation would be the full order skirt steak cooked medium. The atmosphere is great. There is out door seating with misters. The inside has huge horseshoe leather booths for comfort.  If you haven't tried Yard House your missing out on a gem.",

When we were finally taken to our table, our waitress was quick to introduce herself and take our order.  Food arrived late and it was warm not hot, chicken had no taste and the rice was hard, appetizers (bbq meat) was 50% fatty.   We spoke to the waitress about the food but nothing was done to fix it. Overall it was a nice environment for our dinner, even tough the food was awful, service and attention was decent enough to keep our glasses full. lighting was poor and didn't help people with poor vision (my mom), was loud where you had to scream to the other person across from you and cream at the waitress to get your order across.  Just be ware! This is a sports bar and not appropriate for a family dinner spot.",

The orange chicken however was pretty decent. I ordered their lemon drop martini which was Eh. Overall experience, our server was pleasant, the ambiance was decent but the food we ordered was not so great. I'm pretty sure there are other entrees that are decent.

    "text": "Wow. I always love going to Yard House for food and drinks, but this location really went above and beyond. We had friends visiting town that had accidentally made reservations for the Scottsdale location but they still managed to seat us at around the time of the reservation. Now speaking about the menu, it is enormous - lots to look at, but I haven't had something I was disappointed with. In addition, their beer menu has so many options, there's something for everyone! We ordered the onion ring tower to share between all 4 of us and we were all very satisfied. The onion rings were very crispy and were served with two dips: chipotle ranch and a buttermilk ranch. My boyfriend ordered the pepper-crusted filet, which is served on top of Parmesan mashed potatoes, asparagus, carrots, and a brandy shallot cream sauce. He gobbled all of it up and had no complaints. I tried a bite of his steak and it was indeed pepper-y and had a nice crust on the outside but was still cooked to perfection. I ordered the chicken nachos as my entree and boy were they huge. I started digging in and by the time everyone had finished their dishes, it still looked like I had more than half to go! The nachos were delicious wish lots of toppings: chicken, beans, cheese, red&green sauces, salsa, guacamole, and sour cream! Because I didn't want to take any leftovers home as the chips would get too soggy, I ended up eating more of the toppings off and I enjoyed every bit. The sauces and cheese added lots of flavor and the portion you get is outrageous!! In addition to great food, the service was amazing. I snuck away from the table to mention to our waitress that my friend's had gotten engaged the day before and she immediately arranged for a complimentary dessert to come out for them and it was just perfect. If you're at the outlets and are looking for some good food and a killer beer list, this is the place to check out!",

    "text": "I usually don't wright these but after my experience here last night I felt it necessary. My husband wanted The Yard House for his birthday dinner so we came with a party of 12. I had tried to call in advance and make reservations but they had already been booked so the host recommended to me over the phone that I should show up 30-40 min early myself so that by the time my party got there I would already have our spot and they all wouldn't have to wait. This is exactly what I did. However, the wait was much longer than expected. Apparently the table that they wanted to sit our larger party had one table in the middle of guests who just were not leaving which was making it impossible for them to have our table ready. I ended up waiting way longer than I was told and as our guests arrived they waited too. The manager working at the time (I'm upset I didn't get his name because he deserves some recognition) was so caring and apologetic and I could tell he wasn't just saying things because he had to but because he really wanted to help us out. He explained the table situation and thanked us for our patience and asked if we wanted to continue waiting, I told him we would wait longer. What I appreciated most was he then went out of his way to say \"well let me do something for you guys because I appreciate your patience\" and he bought our whole party a round of drinks from the bar while we waited! I thought this was amazing customer service given nobody from our party had complained or been upset with him yet he still felt it necessary to go out of his way and do something nice for us. I thought that was AWESOME! After getting our drinks we only waited about 5 more minutes and were then seated. Once being seated the service was also awesome! Everybody is so friendly and on top of thing. I never had to ask to have my drink refilled , never had to remind them when we asked for something which was impressive when you have a large party like we did. The food was amazing and the menu offers such a selection of different types of foods it has something for whatever you're in the mood for.  Besides waiting so long (which was a big part my fault I shouldve tried to book reservations sooner) this place was awesome and I feel like they went above and beyond to keep my party happy. Will definitley be returning!",

    "text": "Meh...   Went there twice while on vacation. The first night (after a Coyotes game) had excellent service from Jan. Street tacos were rather small, but tasty. The Ahi salad rocked. The main gripe is that their house beer is some watered down swill from Utah and they still charge almost $7 a pint! A better choice is any of the local offerings from Four Peaks. They have a lot of beer listed on tap, but we're out of most of the English selections I wanted to try.   Went back the next night and had rotten service by some overwhelmed waitress that treated us like we were to blame for her misery. She took our order and threw our check at us while we had no less than 5 other servers bring our food, drinks, and checked in on us. Nachos were fantastic and again had to mortgage the house to pay for my beer.  With a draft beer costing the price of a six-pack and hit and miss service, we'll try every other option in and around Westgate before we go back...",

    "text": "After the USA won against Venezuela on Saturday, we headed to the Westgate center. Originally the plan was to go to McFadden's, but there were about 100 people in line. We also tried Calico Jack's upstairs, but it was too loud and not conducing to conversation. I had previously bookmarked this bar, and so, we gave is a try. FYI, in case Google Maps tells you you're 0.2 miles from Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville (like it did for me), you're actually right next door if you go towards the back of the center and to the right of Calico Jack's.  At about 11:30PM or so on a Saturday night, the wait time was 30-45 minutes for a table inside (keep in mind there was a hockey game too), but we were seated immediately at an outside table. Even though it was quite cold, there are heat warmers hanging from the roof. I ordered the French Onion soup, and I was pleased to note it was made properly with a slab of cheese on top, followed by a layer of bread, and the soup underneath. It is a pet peeve of mine when French Onion soup is made incorrectly (like at La Madeleine). My friend had the steak, which he said was delicious, but I think the star of the meal was the garlic french fries. They're thin, like at Smashburger, but REALLY delicious! I probably could've just ordered a side of fries and been totally satisfied. I can still remember the taste of them, two days later!  For a hot cocoa, bowl of soup (more like a mini crock pot of soup), tip, and tax, I think my portion of the bill was about $12. The waiter was attentive and friendly. He voluntarily brought water after I'd finish my hot cocoa, even though I didn't ask for it (much appreciated). If you want some great food, relaxing conversation, and interesting people watching, this is the place to be!",

The menu also has a selection of about 8 different vegan things to eat. We will be coming back for sure.  The only thing I can say for improvement is that, if they want to cater to vegans as it seemed on the menu, they need to have a separate fryer for vegan things like french fries. They have a huge kitchen so I am sure there is space to figure this out.",

We got the skinny margaritas first off which were pretty good- made with fresh lime & 1800 silver.  Also the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread was a no- go for us.  We thought it sounded good but 1 bite in I'm like \"this is not what I expected even though I didn't know what to expect!\"  For mains she got the gardenia (faux chicken) Thai noodle salad and I had the Greek salad, which my friend got last time and said it was \"vinegary\".  It sounded good still but I totally agree the acidity was too much for me.  I also got the short rib street taco which was decent and saved my first 2 courses.  We shared the mini chocolate souffle at the end which was a nice light cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Our server was Torii and he was courteous, timely, and accurate.",

Spinach/cheese dip was black and looked like they forgot to put cheese in it. Chowder was tangy, luke-warm and old...clams were un-chewable. So disappointing. When waitress came to table after food was served, you could see the look of horror on her face as she glanced at the food. She insisted the manager come to the table. He did, and removed items from our bill; however, instead of acknowledging how the food CLEARLY appeared awful, he told us how we were the only ones to complain that night. Really.

The prices are a bit higher but so is the quality.  But I must take away some stars for  their reservation policy. My husband loves The Yardhouse, so 2 of his birthday dinners have now been held there. Despite having over 10 people they still refuse to accept a reservation or even allow call ahead. The night we went there was no hockey game or event but with the Superbowl around the corner- Westgate was busier than usual. We arrived 45 minutes before the rest of the party did and we were still quoted an hour and a half wait time.  Previous reviews were right about the small bar area- it makes it very hard to waste your wait time there, and while the patio is nice I wish it had more space to accommodate people waiting for a table with beverage in hand.",

Not a good place for a family to have dinner.  I had to explain to my 9 year old why people were acting \"weird\".  If you plan on trying to carry on a conversation good luck!

The Yard House @ Westgate also has great ambiance.  The bar is always a fun place to sit and outdoor seating is enjoyable especially when the weather is nice.  Outdoors you can choose to sit in comfy patio chairs with cocktail tables or at regular tables that allow you a view of the center fountains.  Service--I've always had great service from the staff, even on a crowded night.  They always seem friendly and fun.  They do their best to accommodate and make decent recommendations when you're not sure what to order.  Food--The spinach dip is wonderful as an appetizer.  I usually order the thai chicken or walnut pear salad which I always get with the dressing on the side, in case I don't finish. I tried the roasted turkey pot pie once, which is HUGE and could feed 2 easily.  It held up well and wasn't half bad reheated....Beer is ALWAYS good.  I've never had a beer there that I didn't like and a while ago, you used to be able to buy a whole 'yarder', where they served you a beer in a yard long glass.  My out of town guests loved ordering the 'yarder' b/c it was a unique experience.    Cost--I do have to agree with some of the other posters--the prices could be better but I enjoy it there so much, that's just the trade off.",

On our way out, we asked the hostess \"How long's the wait?\" Hostess \"None\"  We were immediately seated and our waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food was standard bar fare. Burgers and the like, I had the sliders and they were good.  The beer list was big. I'm from Portland and we love our beer up there and it was nice to see that many unique and hard to find beers on one list.   My only fear with a beer list that great is how long they keep beer on tap. Meaning, I order some fancy pants euro brew, has that keg been tapped for a week or 6 months?",

A friend of mine invited me to go since I have been visiting from out of town during the spring training.  I have to say that this time around was so very impressive. My server went on and beyond the call of duty just to help us enjoy our meal. .I ordered the macaroni n Cheese squares. Very Good!!!!!   My servers named was Brandon, tall young man with blue eyes and dark short hair. He really new the menu and his job. Very pleasurable to talk to and always a smile, and willing to make sure we were happy.. Never asked for any refills nor did we sit with dirty dishes.. I being a server many years ago, I look for certain things.. I have to say I was very impressed at the way we were treated on this day. I'm not sure how your server's are trained, but I really have to say you did a great job with him.. He is a great asset to your company, I just wish more servers were like him.. They are very far and few anymore.. It was a great time and great food!! Will visit again in the future and hope to have him as a server! Thanks so much for jobs well done!!!!!",

What's nice is that the wait can be spent seated on the loveseats outside, with heat lamps in the winter and an ice cold cocktail or beer in the summer. And I like the layout better than the Desert Ridge location. I always feel like I'm in a huge hallway there.   The staff is almost always very friendly (one off experience, but I think she was just having a bad day), the selection of beers and other drinks is endless, and the menu has something for just about everyone. The atmosphere is casual with a buzz in the air, and it's cool to look at the 'microbrew equipment'. It has to be for show, because I've never seen anyone near that stuff. Maybe someone knows different?? lol  The ahi tuna is mmmm mmmm good. If you're a salad lover, try the grilled hearts of romaine with gorgonzola vinaigrette. Ask for grilled chicken breast on top, if you're feeling carnivorous. Seriously, it is the best. And bring floss!",

If you are just going out for some drinks and to watch a game, this isn't the place... not for $7 a beer.  Happy hour is the only time I will grab a beer here.... I know, I know, they have 100 some beers on tap, but in most cases I can drive to BevMo and buy a six pack just a cheap.  Now, the food is good, the beer is cold, so that's worth three stars at least... but I wouldn't take a first date here (a meal and drinks can run you $100 easy... I'm not putting that much into someone I may never see again) or just meet and hang out with friends.  Hey maybe that's just me.  It's worth checking out, if you have a lot of money sitting around.",

Glendale did not disappoint!   Appetizers:  Onion Ring Tower - I'm not a big fan of onion rings, so when my coworker ordered these, I was thinking \"maybe I'll pass\". However, they were actually quite good, especially with the chipotle and ranch dipping sauces.   Blue Crab Cakes - Love crab cakes! These were pretty good! Liked the chutney that accompanied it.   Main Course:  New York Steak and Fries - I wanted MEAT and I got MEAT!! I finally broke down and ordered it \"medium\" (I've been a \"WELL DONE\" customer forever). It was juicy and flavorful. With a little A-1, it was filling (I'm sad to say I still had a few bites left I could not polish off )!   Dessert:  Kona Coffee Ice Cream Sundae - I swear I thought I was full! Of course, you only live once, so I went for it! Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY, watched my dessert as it came through the door and to our table! Holy crap! HUGE!!! REALLY HUGE! Guess what? I ate most of it! Here's the description:   \"java chip ice cream topped with Oreo cookie crumbles, macadamia nuts and chocolate sauce. served with macadamia nut cookie\"   I didn't eat until lunch the next day! So worth it!   Atmosphere:   Eat outside! Let people be envious of what you order here!   Bathrooms:   LOL! We all agreed the bathrooms had really nice fixtures. Seriously! By the way, it was clean!   Can't wait for my next visit to Phoenix!",

I need to try the garlic noodles, sounds good! 2.)  Tons of Beers - UM I dont even like beer all that much, but I get dizzy just looking at the menu. 3.) I wish I got the guys name, cause he impressed me the most.  It was a game day so the bar was packed, standing room only crowd behind me as I enjoyed my bar seat.  On one occasion a guy came up and asked this bartender if they had a certain beer, he immediately said \"No, terrible beer man\". Hahaha, but gave a suggestion to the customer of a similar better tasting beer!  It was great.  So I continued to listen to him provide suggestions to everyone that asked him for a beer.   4.) TVs scattered around nicely. 5.) The patio and the comfy chairs, definitely group happy hour friendly.  CONS: 1.)When it isn't happy hour its way to expensive 2.)The glasses are not ICEY cold, I dont know how anyone can drink draft beer out of a cup that is not icey cold. (I'm picky) 3.)On game days, they card  you at the door, put a bracelet on you, and then when you sit down, they ask your for your id again!  This is the most annoying thing ever, I understand the risks of serving someone under age, but if you are going to card me to get in, put a braclet on me and then ask me for my ID when I sit down, after I have already put it away, I'm angrY!  Sorry it seriously bugs me, obviously!  Of course I'll be back here, because there isn't really a big selection at WestGate, and I don't always want sushi!",

My best buddy from Sweden was with us and he can be very demanding, but Marc handled him perfectly and made some great recommendations when it came to the different beer samplers.  We did a testing where we rated the beers and Marc seemed genuinely interested and checked back with us for the final results.  Before we left we asked another waiter to get the manager (the same guy that had seated us) and we took on a stern attitude as he approached the table and he later admitted that he was getting ready to be complained to, as that's usually the case when he gets called.  We however, only had positive things for him.",

    "text": "Dear Yard House,   I don't like you. Let me clarify; you charge a ridiculous amount of money for beer. Just so we are all clear, I am only reviewing their bar and beer. I did not get the opportunity to dine with the Yard House, and I have a feeling that I won't be going back to do so. I guess I am lucky enough to come from a town that had several True beer houses; beers came from all over the world and you were charged a reasonable price for them. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Yard House. I visited the Yard House in Glendale, right next to the Cardinals and Coyotes stadium, and I felt like I was being charged stadium prices. This area looks great for pre and post game activities but I couldn't imagine going there just to \"hang out\" with friends.   I will give you this - they DO have a great beer selection, if you only want North American beers. The majority of their menu is all North American beers, even their ciders. I'm not a cider drinker but if you do have cider on your list then you always have Strongbow, not at the Yard House. My beer of choice is Bass. Granted Bass is an imported beer and I am willing to pay a hefty $5.50 in most places to enjoy my most favorite of beverages. Yard House thinks they should charge you $6.25. 3 beers = almost $20; that's a little too close to stadium prices if you ask me. Also, these are draft beers that we are talking about - that means the beer should be cheaper than what I would pay if they were in a bottle. From what I could tell, they only had 4 bottles on the menu.   I had high expectations for you Yard House, but now I see you for what you truly are: just another corporate machine charging high prices for that new niche market of micro brews and exotic beers. Now, leave the money on the table and leave.",

    "text": "So this time we came back for lunch and sat at the bar. Service was better except we had 4 different bartenders in 2 hours and one what appeared to be a manager. Jason was very personable and quick to take our orders and give refills. We started with appetizers which took 16 mns to receive. Jason apologized saying there was a party of 40 in the back room. the chicken wraps were wonderful the chicken nice and hot but we also ordered the pear and gorgonzola pizza and it came out cold. Unfortunately this was when we were in between our 4 bartenders and after about 5 minutes of seeing no one we decided to eat it. It was good but would have been fantastic hot. We went on to order thet truffle burger which was cooked perfectly medium and they allowed fruit instead of fries on the side. Better experience than the last time but still not overly impressed. The food is priced for quality dining and unfortunately we found that the Glendale location is lacking a bit all around. The north scottdale location would be my advice.",

    "text": "Happy Hour! My coworkers organized a happy near my home. I was ecstatic it was going to be at the Yard House. Why? Truffle fries, of course. Because I had to pick up children, I sadly could not get an Angry Orchard Hard Apple Cider on draft. I settled for their perfectly balanced virgin strawberry lemonade. I had 2 glasses. Of course, I had my delectable truffle fries. Shoestring fries, perfectly fried, crispy on the outside with a little soft on the inside, sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, parsley, drizzled with a touch of truffle oil. My coworkers looked like they were enjoying their chicken tenders. For $1.30 more, you can convert the fries to truffle fries. Their Margherita pizza looked okay with whole cloves of roasted garlic. The portion for the chicken nachos was enormous. Wow! However, glancing over the spread, I still stick to the truffle fries because they are head and shoulders above everything else!   P/S Arizona's beautifully cool November weather made it amazing to dine on the patio. It was truly a lovely evening with a few of my favorite educators.",

We then asked for a side of queso cheese and were told we would have to pay for it.  They also messed up another order at our table.  The manager (blonde haired lady) came out and argued that instead of bringing a side of queso cheese and taking that off the menu, that they would instead comp two meals (I told them no, just make my gf happy and bring the queso).  So I guess you could say the management \"took care of us\".  I just find it odd that they have no problem taking meals off, and not actually correcting the problem (and arguing with us).",

Soon two other people came in and were seated right behind us, shortly after being seated the waiter approached their table to take their dink orders while we still sat (which had been 15 minutes at this point in an empty restaurant).

She said it's a new thing that they just have for a few weeks. We tried to browse around the tablet to see if we able to order food from there, but I guess not. We would still have to wait for our waitress to take our orders. We ordered the chicken bbq pizza, the ahi nachos, and a tower of onion rings. The chicken bbq pizza has way to much bbq sauce on it so it's overpowering everything else so I feel I just tasted only bbq sauce on the whole pizza. The ahi nachos was wonderful, I love the sesame sauce on the chips and the ahi tuna, very flavorful. The onion rings was also delicious, very crispy and dip in ranch was perfect.  I would definitely come back again if I feel like American food, plus it is closer to home.",

    "text": "Yard House is a pretty typical chain restaurant when it comes to ones you hear about. But one thing that definitely sets them above the rest is the quality of food and their amazing beer selection. I visited this location for the second time now last week.   FOOD: I've only had the food once and that was during my most recent visit. I ended up showing up late for the late night happy hour deals which were actually pretty cheap! I ended up ordering an onion ring tower, and a BBQ Pizza. The total time took about 15 minutes to get to the table. The onion rings could have been better, but overall weren't bad! The BBQ pizza was great and I am glad that I decided to order that. There was a good amount of chicken on it which was nice. The half yard jars are the way to go here. There are countless options for beers to try here.   SERVICE: The service here both times that I have visited has been great. The bartender from my most recent visit was super friendly and really cared about my beer preferences. He gave me some great samples to try on some new taps. Everyone was really welcoming and helpful.   OVERALL: Yard House is a great place to grab a drink and some food. Their food is a little pricey, but they have a great happy hour and late happy hour. Their staff is friendly and the bartenders are super helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone stopping into Westgate!",

    "text": "Thanks to yelp for helping me in finding this amazing brewery!  I was shopping at tanger outlets and after the mall closed it was time for dinner. We found this place with great reviews so decided to dine in here.   Parking is the biggest problem here - it was so crowded on a Saturday evening post 9pm that it took us around 30mins to find parking in that huge lot. Never knew parking could be a problem in AZ!!  We opted to be seated in the patio as there was a band playing live in the garden and the weather was nice too.. the place was very crowded as expected. Service was quick and really good considering the crowd.  I ordered the blonde ale after the server suggested me to try which I loved & the gardein rice bowl. Ordered crispy brussel sprouts with potatoes- it was definitely crispy but very greasy (probably deep fried). Some more flavors or seasonings would certainly help.  Overall a lovely find & will definitely return if I'm in the area.",

    "text": "When I was a wee bae living in a small town, the biggest highlight of each year was when the Carnival came to town.   We would walk through the midway, amidst a sea of different families and people young and old. There were all manner of lights, sounds, and activity. The loud motors of the rides, the clanking and groaning of metal as they spun.   There was a cornucopia of smells and drinks, snacks like cotton candy, corn dogs, fresh lemonaide, and hot dogs.   This is what the Westgate Entertainment District in Glendale reminded me of this afternoon; and I completely enjoyed myself.   We strolled along the crowded sidewalk and into the Yard House restaurant. We ordered corn chips and fresh guacamole for a starter. It was very fresh and tasted great.   My entree was the Gardein Ckicken Fried Rice bowl and my wife's was the Gardein Vegan Burger. Both were excellent.   The place was packed, but our Server Brad took good care of us the entire time. Somehow, the kitchen kept up and we had our meals without an extended wait.   For vegans who crave a professionally prepared meal, Yard House will meet your needs in terms of presentation, flavor, service, and atmosphere.   If you visit on the weekend, you can also enjoy the rest of Westgate's carnival-like charm.",

We weren't overly hungry, so we just ordered a couple of pizzas (One BBQ chicken pizza and one cheese pizza).  Not the most exciting choices given Yard House's vast menu, but I was legitimately impressed by these two pies.  I ate the entire cheese pizza by myself.  The sauce was complex, which had me studying the extra side of it that I ordered.  My wife and son loved the BBQ chicken pizza.  They also ordered a Lobster, Crab and Artichoke Dip appetizer.  My wife commented that this was decent, but not on the level of several other versions she has had.  Other notes: -Our server was sweet and did an average job   -The atmosphere was good with the volume being acceptable for us (I noticed several others commented on it being too loud).   -The dining space was beautiful.   -If you have never been to a Yard House, the menu is similar to that of The Cheesecake Factory -I would have rated 3.5 stars if I was able to   This experience was good enough, and there are enough interesting menu items, that we will probably try the location in our town (Cincinnati).",

My wife ordered 1 house honey blonde and I ordered 1 house white ale. Both were very refreshing. For appetizer we had ordered crispy Brussels sprouts and potatoes and for entree we ordered gardenin chicken fried rice. My wife found the fried rice little salty but I was okay with the taste. The sprout and potato was crispy as the name suggested. All in all good vibe and nice location. Good place to sit and talk as well.",

Our group had just about every appetizer on the menu and mostly all grained a solid thumbs up. The only one that received a resounding negative was the fried calamari, weird flavor, and texture. I had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it was great, I ate the whole thing myself.  The atmosphere is nice, plenty of space to mingle, servers are right there but almost invisible. Oh, the beer selection, over 100 beers on tap. Taps surround the inner bar. And those who had beer, rather than wine, were pleased. Many will be returning to grab ahold of the beer sampler. Great place for a happy hour get together.  I had a nice Chardonnay and a pizza for $13, a deal and I left happy.",

Yard House as a whole is great but this one I will never go back to, the manager gave me two gift cards but were expired gift cards so she didn't care just like the server Hanh.

    "text": "First time at the Yard House. We arrived after a movie (about 5:30 on a Saturday night) and had to wait 15-20 mins for a table. Acceptable for the size of the crowd.   Our server, Sarah, was outstanding all evening. She greeted us right away, apprised us of menu changes and serviced our table efficiently.   Between the three of us, we got an order of Blackened Shrimp Tacos, two Bacon Cheddar Burgers and three drinks. It all came to $70 plus tip. There were dozens of drink options.   The manager approached our table because my daughter ordered her tacos gluten free. He wanted to verify if it was due to preference or allergy. Since it was allergy, he offered to cook the shrimp in a skillet as opposed to the flat top. Very nice touch.   Our order arrived in ten mins. My burger was excellent. The cheddar was thick enough to really come thru with flavor. The bun was toasted and the patty was beautifully crusted by the flat top.   I recommend The Yard for a great meal after a game or movie.",

    "text": "I came here at about 6 pm on a Friday to try and snag a table for 7 at 6:30 pm. It wasn't a game night or anything but I was still a bit worried about the wait. By 6:15 the hubby and I were sitting at our table. However, everyone else was showing up at 6:30. The staff was understanding and didn't give us any problems about the wait.   Our server was fabulous. She was attentive and incredibly pleasant and friendly. She noticed every time someone joined our party and was quick to help them.   We started with some snacks to kill time while waiting for our friends to show up. I opted for the guacamole and chips. I wasn't too sure about the feta in the guac but it turned out to be good. The hubby had the sweet potato fries and maple bacon dip. I'm not a sweet potato lover but I may have eaten them just for the dip. It was nice to have a \"snack\" sized portion that was perfect for just that - snacking. I had the turkey club for dinner which had avocado on it. It was nothing special but still pretty good. The hubby had a spicy thai chicken pizza that he seemed to really enjoy. Overall, it seemed like everyone in the party enjoyed their meals.   Their beer selection is pretty awesome. In reality, that was the reason we opted for the Yard House for dinner. The server was great at knowing what they had run out of and what wasn't on the menu.  For those unfamiliar with beers, she seemed to know what to suggest based on tastes.   At the end of the meal, there was no issue splitting the check and getting separate bills. That was refreshing from what I'm used to. Overall it was a pretty good dining experience and I wouldn't hesitate to come back again.",

    "text": "Great place, for it was here that I finally found a beer to call my own: Lost Coast Great White and it is delicious in a tall half-yard glass.  Shiitake Mushroom off the Snack section of the menu is great for the price.  Bernaise Sliders were surprisingly a favorite of mine but a recent visit revealed to me \"they are not served that way anymore\" as stated by the waitress that night.  The steak I get from time to time done medium-rare is great, Ahi Sashimi and Coconut Shrimp with their accompanying spicy papaya salad is always a plus.  Finally can't argue with the overall look and feel of the place: flat-screens everywhere for whatever sport you're into and a bar ready to serve you with over 100 beers on tap.  Only reason for the lack of a 5th star was the most recent visit feels as if the place recent underwent 'restructuring' of some kind. Either the Chef(s) got replaced or left and the menu actually went from the large book of at least 7 pages that I'm used to seeing, to a double sided menu with WAY less items which usually denotes a smaller kitchen staff in most cases, my bernaise sliders being gone from the menu was what tipped me off to something happening recently.  As a result of whatever may have caused this, the Shiitake Mushroom noodles that I order on occasion has a way different texture than what I was accustomed to and did not enjoy it as much as I usually do the last time I visited. Maybe I'll ask the next time I'm there to see what really went down if it's at all possible to get an answer.  Overall it's a great place to relax and dine or enjoy a few snack items and a beer to go along with it. Definitely a place to visit on occasion.",

I even have enough time to write this review while I wait for my check to get split out which took an additional 30 minutes. By the way there was maybe a total of 8 people at the entire bar top. 2: I ordered an appetizer that never showed up and I actually forgot I placed the order. They forgot I placed the order too. 3. They made me pay $7/each for tacos because they don't have a vegan taco option and wouldn't let me substitute a custom taco WITH their vegan meat substitute which is significantly cheaper to produce and buy opposed to an actual animal. Think about it. 4. My bartender was rude and kept making comments back to me every time I pointed out how something was wrong.  I told him I just wanted to leave and stop waiting around and he said \"me too\". 5. The chefs aren't wearing gloves 6. If there was a 0 star option I would've chosen it.",

We had another waiter that was so great Jared , the young lady I asked to get manager first went to Darin and told him we asked for manager then to manager then they both were kinda jerks when they came back out, Darin completely ignored us. He gave my husband 2 beers with floaty stuff in them and seems quite perterbed he had to get another beer for us, he told manager then waited for a while to get clear beer which he didn't not get to enjoy due to all of this, then we also did not finish our dinner we left. When I said hey ty for ruining our evening he smiled and said yw. No thanks!

Everyone there is great - there was an occasion I took my mother there back in 2009 that wasn't so pleasant and slightly embarrassing due to the poor service- I boycotted them for a while... But, after some time away, I don't know if they've had a management change since then or what, but the customer service is amazing. The atmosphere is great. It is literally my most favorite place to go, eat, drink, people watch, have great service!  It has it all really.... it is slightly expensive, but I don't care. I am more than willing and eager to pay for the great experience I get there.   I recently got a new job and after my friend just kind of blurted it out to the waitress she congratulated me and I thought that was that, but no it wasn't. She came out with a plate that said congrats in cocoa and a little brownie a la-mode.  It was so sweet! The waitress was great! I wish I remembered what her name was... sigh. I'm sorry wonderful waitress.   Anyways, this place is always a place I go to whenever I get the chance!",

I made a reservation on one of the occasions I went there for lunch and it still took 1.5 hours from sit down to exit. When you're on a conference and pressed for time, that type of service is unacceptable. The quality of food almost made up for the slow service, if the wait staff had been rude, I would have lost it and complained to the manager.   I can't say anything was particularly bad aside from the slow service. Nearby restaurants were not nearly as slow and many had more patrons inside them. I hope their service speeds up because the location is appealing and the food really is good (for YH). Maybe next time i'm in the area, things will be different.",

Also, the dish of beans served with the fish taco was about 10 beans in a cup of liquid.

I love the chicken nachos even though this is an upper scale restaurant, these nachos are delicious. I don't care for beans so I ordered them without beans or red sauce and the green sauce on the side. Omg my  mouth is watering just thinking about it lol. It's a little pricey but worth it. I love Westgate, it's close to my house  so I'm glad there's a Yardhouse near by!",

It was a Saturday night so we didn't mind the 45 minute wait for a table but it was a bit annoying to have to wait for more drinks. Our drinks were brought out by a different server each time and when they forgot to bring one for someone in our party they would blame the primary server for not putting it on the ticket or the bar for not making it.   I will say that the food is always great but the service could use a refresher.",

    "text": "We ate at Yard House this afternoon to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. Based on the reviews here on yelp I expected it to be a great experience. HUGE MISTAKE. First off \" Katie\" tried sitting us in a booth that had food crumbs and something shiny on the table and the seats. Then she sat us by the waitress/cashier area...I kept smelling something...it smelled like rancid garbage. Apparently one of the waitresses smelled it too because she sprayed bleach right behind me. Not sure which smell was worse right before dinner. Our waitress, Dee, brought us the onion ring tower...an old fashioned for my husband and a salted watermelon margarita for me. The onion rings were OK, nothing special. My husband liked his drink, mine however was horrible. I wasn't familiar with el jimador tequila but the rest of the ingredients looked great/fresh so I ordered it. Seriously it tasted like Cuervo...extremely harsh/nasty. Up to this point it's all small stuff that I can overlook but.....For Dinner my husband ordered the shrimp & calamari diablo and I ordered the lobster garlic noodles. My husbands dish looked really bad/awful presentation, but he said it tasted OK. Mine looked great but tasted bad. The pasta was dried out as if it wasn't fresh and the whole dish had a rich taste to it that ruined the seafood. I took 2 bites and was done. In all fairness our waitress, Dee, tried more than once to make the drink order right but my husband didn't want to waste it so he chocked it down. I didn't complain about the food...I suspect if I had that Dee would have taken it back. But for the money this dinner cost I shouldn't have to complain and Dee shouldn't have to work so hard to make it up to customers. Dee was a sweet girl and gave excellent customer service...she was the only positive thing about this place. Oh, and we did notice that the girl behind us left with most of her food still on the plate. We boxed ours up...my husband didn't want to waste food so he will try and eat it later but I suspect most of it will end up in the trash anyway. Very disappointing/expensive afternoon.",

So, speaking from over 20+ years of Yardhouse-experience, let me share how to maximize your experience at this location:  A.) The location is prime.  It's right in the middle of Westgate and is great for people-watching, and it serves as a perfect pre-football or hockey game location.  B.) Happy hour= awesome!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yardhouse.com%2FAZ%2Fglendale-restaurant%2Fhappy-hour%2F&s=b913fa391761e952b9795c9eba5de55b565f4b5896c03f167e88995289f67d43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yardhouse.com/AZ/glendal...</a> Highlights include the Chicken Nachos (enough to feed two people until you almost puke); Pizzas (hot and yummy); Fried Calamari (some of the best I've had this side of the Mediterranean): Ahi Roll (better than Filet Mignon IMO); Spinach Cheese Dip; The Sliders- especially pastrami (enough to stuff you to the brim); and well, pretty much everything else!  Oh yeah, the drinks are great and are reasonable.  If you like IPA like me, the Green Flash West Coast IPA will melt in your mouth.  They have over 100 beers on tap, so you are bound to find something that you like!  C.) The service.  It's really good overall and you will be taken care of very well.  D.) The food.  It's all very good and filling.    If all that doesn't convince you, that's okay- I'm happy to have the place to myself!  After all, I am the Duke!  ;)",

I love coming for happy hour as they have an excellent selection of food and beer specials. Plus their hand crafted Martinis are on special.   I've eaten several items from the main menu, favorites are mac n cheese (sounds simple) but with truffle oil it's amazing, plus the lobster noodles. Heck anything is really good here. The only thing it can get pricy but I don't mind paying for quality once in a while.

The bacon burger seemed small when it came out but by the time I was finished, I was satisfied. The main attraction for this place are the beers. They have a HUGE selection of beers and the vast majority of them are on draft. For me this is awesome for two reasons; 1) I LOVE BEER and they have lots, 2) I will take a draft beer over a bottled beer every time!   I am really looking forward to going back were I can spend more time drinking and less time eating.",

Yard House does a fantastic job at giving patrons a chance to find something they like, simply because of their wide variety.   The atmosphere in Westgate is fun, giving everyone a chance to have good conversation, the chance to listen to live music, and eat/drink.   The only downside to Yard House is the outdoor seating. During the hotter months in Phoenix, they've had continued trouble with the system that sprays mist. Without the mist, there's no point being outside and you'll end up losing the cool vibe of Westgate.   Overall great food, great beer, and a great part of Phoenix to socialize in.",

The meat was tasteless; cardboard would have more flavor, but that's what i ate, I ate cardboard. The bun was dried out and the top was flaking due to freezer burn. I'd rather of ordered a burger from McDonalds and would of enjoyed it more. C'mon Darden...this was a decent restaurant before you took it over, don't screw it up!",

I'm not a drinker, but my friends ordered a Shiner Bock and Shock Top. These things were 18\" tall.  Quite interesting.  They loved them.  The calamari was very good also, but the Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza, they said, was not good.  Ashley offered to replace it with something else, which was very generous, but we chose not to.  Our meal had pretty much ended by then.  It is worth visiting this restaurant. But I would suggest getting there early, it gets very crowded.",

I had the pepper crusted Gorgonzola burger, my hubby had the mac & cheese, which he said is the best in town!  I keep track of everything I eat so I really splurged on this 1500 cal burger and also at $13 it is pretty expensive for a burger, but man is this thing good!  The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because we had to wait for a table which is not unusual Westgate but also because we didn't see our server for the first 15 minutes that we sat down. Once we did get her attention she was very quick, got us to hockey game on time and did everything else very well.   If you're in Westgate, it's not too crowded and you have a few extra bucks, I recommend this Yardhouse.",

After waiting for 20 minutes for new rice I called her over to the table and she said that it was still not ready. I told her not to worry about it and to just bring me the check. She then looked at me and said I did not charge you for the cup of tomato soup. Like she was doing me a favor. I didn't ask for the soup to begin with you offered it to me because my rice was hard. I usually don't complain about the food I order but this time I felt I had to say something because I felt so disrespected. I asked the manager not to charge me for the rice sine it was not edible and she comped the Sea bass.

The big surprise was the complete organization and professionalism of this establishment!  Despite the throngs of customers, all hyped up for the game, the service and food were excellent.  We had to carb load to have energy for the game (ha!) so indulged in the gargantuan Chicken Nachos and the Sliders and Fries.  Our fries were lukewarm-but our server Christian immediately came back from the kitchen with crispy hot fries, before we could blink our eyes.  He was calm, cool and collected amidst all of the gazillion customers.  My only suggestion regarding the food is to season the chicken in the nachos.  It appeared to be steamed and unadorned.  Also serve with a side of salsa.  I sought out a Manager to compliment the restaurant on its efficient handling of the customers during a busy time.  Score a big win for the Cardinals-and The Yard House!",

Beer selection was as good as I'd remembered, and I like the diff size offerings, as well as the couple samplers available. Food menu is definitely expansive and it took a while to decide on what I wanted. Had an asada taco and blackened swordfish taco. Both tasted good and my only complaint was that the chilled edamame was somewhat lackluster, both in terms of taste and portion. Friendly service, even if beer orders did take a while at times (maybe it's bc we were on the patio?). Overall a good time and I'd certainly go back.",

She also had the fried chicken dinner and food was cold especially the Mac n cheese. She asked them to take it back and warm it up and they brought it back and it's as if they didn't, still cold! The nachos were stale and the cheese was burned! The garlic noodles were cold in some areas as well as warm. They compt us for the nachos and tenders but did nothing for my friend and her family. They traveled all the way from Tucson and we could have ate elsewhere but we chose the Yatd House! Bad decision at this point! The waitress was amazing but the rest of the service was the worst experience we've had. They should focus on customer satisfaction and not freeze the customers as well as their food. They're more concerned on keeping the employees comfortable ( in the kitchen) with it set to 64 degrees! As expensive as it was, we expected a higher bar/quality of service. We won't be returning!",

Luckily we had friends who got their early to get us a table. Service was great. We had 2 servers for the party of 13. Very prompt with refills, super friendly, and took great care of us.   We started with the Korean beef which was so tender and great flavor. Highly recommend!  I got the small BBQ chicken salad and it was amazing! Plenty big in size and tons of ingredients. My fiance got the pepper jack burger and that was good as well.   They brought out a fun small dessert that said happy birthday for the birthday girl which was sweet. They don't sing but we did anyway! I will be back but probably on an off peak hour so that way there is no wait. Overall recommend. Great service, food, and prices.",

We ordered drinks and appetizers right away and received our drinks about ten minutes later followed by the appetizers. When the appetizers were delivered we placed our orders, six adult meals. After watching other diners that had arrived after us receive their food we inquired on our food and we were told it would be right out. After waiting another ten minutes or so (it had been at least 45 minutes since we were seated) and as the start of the Coyotes game was quickly approaching we told staff to forget about the food and send the bill for our drinks. Our bill came quickly and we all cashed out. As we were getting ready to leave, someone that I presume was the manager, came to the table and apologized. As we were walking out a different server came to the table with our meals. Clearly there is a lack of communication between the waitstaff and kitchen. Unfortunately, the service was poor and we will most likely not return despite their new and improved menu including many vegan options.",

If I had to pick one dish, I would definitely go with the jambalaya (hold the chives). The sausage on the jambalaya is perfectly seared. The sausage, not too spicy, not too bland - just right. This place is definitely known for its robust selection of beers, however; I don't think the meals get the credit they deserve. As for as beer goes, I have yet stumped them on any beer I have ordered. This place would be the perfect place to spend an an ideal day beginning with a big lunch and then working your way through beer flights and then calling an Uber upon closing.  Unfortunately, my wife would frown with disgust if I ever proposed such a wild day. Regardless of whether you're in the mood for a great beer or an exquisite entree, look no further than this fine establishment for all your needs. I'm certain they have those fruity girly drinks for the wifey as well.",

The Mr. Pineapple beer was refreshing, light and perfectly sour and I finished the meal with a Youngberry which was a Framboise lambic cut with a chocolate stout.

We kind of got the vibe that our server just didn't want to be working. She didn't give much feedback about the menu, checked on us maybe once, service was slow and she couldn't even crack a smile. Her attitude seemed to be the same with the table next to us so we didn't take it personally but it was a turn off. The presentation of the food was great but the taste was eh (nothing too exciting).

Beers become reasonably priced from 3-6 and late at night, but the best part is the half price appetizers. Where else can you get 3 different kinds of awesome tuna for $6/plate? Or great pizzas for $6? Or top shelf martinis for $6? Decent value if you're a lush with good taste. $50 goes a long way here, but it's $50 minimum to have fun here.  Bartender that I always see there is very nice; service is great.   The decor is boring, the clientele is often obnoxious douche nozzles and coming here for dinner is a pricey mistake (entrees are meh), but 150,000 beers on tap can drown out any shortcomings.",

Not what I want, only a few hours after getting off a plane. However, it was highly recommended by a hotel employee, so I thought it'd be worth a try.  Finally I decided on the margherita pizza. It was terribly salty and not much else. However, the creme brulee was really good. Good thing it was shared with two other people because it was very rich!   Can't vouch for the alcohol offerings, but as far as food goes, it was overpriced and trying too hard to be fancy/trendy. So glad our friend's expense account was covering it because I couldn't feel good about throwing that kind of money at mediocre food.   The big smiles beaming from the workers were big perks, though.

Not once did our waiter come back to the table to ask how our meal was, when he did finally come over the only thing that was finished was the beer and the coke my wife drank. He FINALLY asked how our meal was, he was met with a \"NOT GOOD\", he glossed right over what we said and asked if we wanted to box up our food. You mean the food we barely touched? The ribs were tough and had no taste, and the crusted chicken my wife had a bad taste also. No questions about how was the meal, is there anything else I can get you? Nope, we got the standard \" would you like desert question\", he could care less how our meal was.

I wasn't expecting much since our experience at Gordon Biersch in the same complex was terrible.  Well we went on Wednesday night and I dare say I had some of the best service possible.  The waitress explained everything very well. For an appetizer we got this wierd Sushi Cake?? I know I had questions too but it was well explained first by our dear waitress.  Then I had Linguini with clams in Garlic Sauce and Clam Chowder, abosolutely delightful.  It's somewhat of a sports bar with a large bar and TV screens in the middle.  They have the largest selection of Tap Beer in the Valley! You can view it when your walking along the sidewalk--You see this great room with hundreds of kegs--Quite a site almost like the matrix. There were many people enjoying the night air and it actually looked like a functioning well class restraunt. Don't know how all the business looking people got there, but I dare say \"Glendale you've finally made a success with the Westgate complex on the West Side!\" Finallly it's about time.",

    "text": "This is a newer Yard House, a chain of restaurants in 9 states, with the predominate number of locations n Southern California and Arizona.   Their self described formula is \"Great Food, Classic Rock, World's Greatest Beer Selection\".    Their beer menu is great, but I doubt it is the best in the world. The Sheraton at LAX is at least as good, and they carry Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale, and the Yard House doesn't. But they have a lot of international choices and US micro brews, including 3 brews by the local AZ brewer from Tempe, Four Peaks.   The menu is eclectic, and I would describe it as fusion in a casual food sense. The prices are reasonable, but the dishes try too hard and are over the top. I prefer authentic ethnic food True to their origins and regional flavors, not ethnic flavors mixed up with average American fast food ingredients stack high and made pretty as if it was some great inventions, They are not, and consequently the mish mash waters down the experience.    Hawaiian Poke Stack $5.72. So so, Prefer the real thing. Spicy Tuna Roll $5.82. Again, trying too hard to make it unique. It comes in the shape of a cake. Ginger Crusted Salmon $22.65. Too many flavors and ingredients stacked high to mask mediocre Salmon. Grilled Romaine Salad $8.95. This was pretty good! Mango Sorbet $4.25, 2 large scoops, but low on taste.   Rolled Dead Guy Ale $3.50. Nice tweener of ale and lager. Four Peak Kiltlifter $5.75, Tasty local version of a good Irish Red.  Gulden Draak $4.00, Another in the great tradition of Belgium beers.   What the Yard House lacks in taste and quality, they make up in volume and price. In Glendale, this place is very popular, since there aren't many good choices of ethnic food, so this is a good substitute for those who don't care about authenticity, since they may not know it if they ate it.",

    "text": "My partner and I go here almost every night, so I can tell you a lot about the place.  Don't bother with the \"food\" food, if you can. It's not that it's bad food, but it's almost never worth what they're asking for it. What makes this place awesome is Happy Hour, with lowered drink costs and half priced appetizers. Sunday - Thursday has a second Happy Hour from 10pm - Midnight (kitchen closes at 11:30).  Appetizers I've had:  California Roll. (4 stars) Amazing. It in no way resembles real sushi (but do California rolls ever count as \"real\" sushi?). The dish is served as a rice \"cake\" topped with crab and tabiko, cucumber and avocado. The plate is drizzled with a wasabi soy sauce and dollops of Sri Racha chili sauce.  Spicy Tuna Roll (5 stars) My favorite. And at happy hour prices the most sushi bang for your buck. Same \"cake\" style as the California roll, but without rice. Just spicy tuna, edamame, cucumber. I'm a sucker for spicy raw tuna, and there's TONS of it in this dish. I've never been able to finish a whole one. Oh snap, Atkins friendly appetizer?  Calamari. (4 stars) A pretty big portion with two types of dipping sauce. The calamari tasted fresh and tender - not rubbery, and the batter was light enough to not overwhelm the taste of the squid.  Chinese Garlic Noodles. (3 stars) It's good enough, but it's just garlicky noodles covered in parmesan with big hunks of mushrooms. A good starchy filler if you're really hungry/plan on drinking heavily.  Blue Crab Cakes (3 stars) These are actually delicious, but what keeps them from being 4 star is that you only get two and they're falafel sized (so be sure to get them when they're $6 during happy hour). The mango chutney was a nice touch.  Spinach Cheese (3 stars) The dip is alright, certainly heavy on the spinach (a plus) but it's served with deep fried pita. Seriously, why can't they serve it with baked pita or something that hasn't been dredged in oil? Seemed ill thought out to me.  Margheretia Pizza (4 stars) This little pizza (8 slices, thin crust) is incredibly light and tasty, with whole cloves of roasted garlic - YUM.  Four Cheese Pizza (3 stars) Fontana, Parmesan, Ricotta and Mozzarella. Not overpowering, good balance of flavor, but the giant lumps of ricotta keep it from being a 4 star for me.  Onion Ring Tower (3 stars) It's got a cute little serving plate (the onions are stacked around a central \"pole\") but it's just your basic onion ring - a little on the oily side, which might be excellent if you're pairing it with one of Yardhouse's many, many (MANY), draft beers.  Sliders (4 star) Comes in \"Classic\" or \"Barnaise.\" I think I prefer the classic, because I find bearnaise off-putting, but it does come on the side and that style of slider has fried onion strings (but no cheese). Both styles come with shoe string fries and a pickle. $5.95 for either at happy hour, but I'd almost pay full price for these.  If you ARE in the mood for \"food\" food, then please, at all costs avoid the Mac and Cheese. It's advertised as a \"grown up\" version, but in this case \"grown up\" means oil. Oily cheeses, oily bacon, and...truffle oil? The one time I tried it I needed to pile noodles up on the sides of the plate in an attempt to let the puddle of oil drip off. This wasn't a little puddle either, it was practically a lake in the middle of the bowl. I abandoned it about a third of the way through.  The Creme Brule is good, but not worth the $8.25.",

Twice I have been placed on a waiting list of 20+ minutes despite seeing 3 or more tables and outside seating totally open and available--and I am not counting open tables that just need cleaning.  The waitlist had 3 guests before us. Why hadnt they been seated already?!  I am sure they were thinking the same thing. They also neglected to offer the bar seating. I am exhausted by their snobbery.  Went to Gordon Biersch instead. Was seated and served immediately. Food and atmosphere there was GREAT. GB got our patronage and our server enjoyed a 20%+ tip.",

So we asked for the bill together. I believe we had such bad service because his tip was already added to our bill (gratuity) By the way, he's the bald guy around his late 20s.

Their menu is massive and have yet to have something that we don't like. Especially love the ahi tuna app as well as the pizzas (margherita and pineapple/ham). Last time we were in my husband could not remember which Amber beer he had the last time we were there. The server made it his mission to find out which one it was making several trips to the taps and listing off names and styles until he found which one it was which was impressive. The servers and bartenders have genuine personalities, but are not overbearing. I also like the semi-open kitchen where you can see back of house staff working. Yard House is one of my favorite go-to places to grab a beer/wine and a tasty little snack.",

    "text": "A bit of a letdown really. I love the whole brew pub type concept (this isn't a brew pub, but they have an extensive menu and a ton of beers on tap), but I am not a big fan of chains. In this case, we had tickets to a comedy show near here, and were in the mood for a pint and some sort of fall food. In researching, we found that they had a bunch of stouts/porters, and had a grilled cheese/tomato soup on the menu. Done! We anticipated a wait for a table, but when we got there, we had to wait a good 5 minutes to get our name in. In hindsight, I should have just gotten my phone out and called from right in front of the desk. Two of the girls at the desk spent the entire time dealing with another customer and ignoring us. Another lady tried to cut in front so I piped up, and finally got acknowledged. The wait for a table was only maybe 10-15 minutes which was reasonable.  Once seated, it did take a little while to be acknowledged by the server, and it did take an abnormally long time to actually get the beer I ordered.  We ordered the sweet potato fries for a starter, which never came because the server admitted that she never rang it in.  Same with the French onion soup that my old lady ordered with her meal. This seemed quite odd because we ordered everything at the same time.  We decided to skip the fries by that point since we already had our meals, but my girlfriend's street taco plate was pretty sparse so she wanted her soup. The soup did come quickly.  Her food was good, but again there was very little for what we paid. My grilled cheese and tomato soup was very good. So I am not entirely sure we will be back. The food was good but pricey and the service was spotty. I should mention that this was on a night where there was no hockey game, so the apparent understaffing of the servers is disappointing.  I almost forgot to mention. Their beer menu online is much more extensive that at the actual restaurant. They list about 25-30 \"darks\" (meaning porters and stouts) online, but had about 10 at the restaurant. I was torn between a few options and thankfully they let me sample 2 beers before deciding. I really wish I could have customized my own flight they way they do at Des Schuttes in Portland or Uncle Bear's in ahwatukee. But the only flights you can do are already pre packaged for you.  Oh well.  With a big selection, I would have loved to do a taste test of my own.",

The beer selection is awesome; they have over 100 beers and various sizes so you can try as many as you like.    The quality of the service at the bar left something to be desired; there were eight to ten bartenders present, none of whom noticed that they had not taken our order.  We waved and called out to them for a few minutes, while they all walked by, oblivious.  After we finally resorted to tapping our glass on the bar, they took our order - but not without a snotty attitude.  I will say, however, that the waitress at the table was much more polite and attentive.    I'll go back, but I'll probably steer clear of the bar since good service can make or break your experience.",

The LARGE tap beer selection is, in a word, phenomenal.  If you want a quiet night of dining, or a sports bar environment, you can get both in this place, and not feel detrracted from either desire.  5 stars for service, quality of food, and atmosphere.  Definitely recommend to anyone.  We'll be going back whenever we're in Phoenix/Glendale again.",

    "text": "Okay, so we've been here twice now, and I feel I can write a fair review.  :)  The first time we went to the Yardhouse, we loved the assortment of draft beer first and foremost!  107 different draft beers?!?  What's this you say??  I was impressed!   I needed an extra ten minutes with the menu, just to make my beverage choice alone!  I went with the Honey Blonde house draft - it was...good.  I ordered the baby spinach salad...and for my second round of beer asked for a blend of the berry cider with an amber ale (I even suggested the house amber)...they brought me a \"black velvet\"...it was not what I was expecting.  Not the right color or taste...(I learned why on our round two trip - stay tuned).  My salad came...over dressed...I mean, if it were wearing clothes, it would have had a prom dress on.  Soggy.  I ate what I could, gulped down my okay brew, and we moved on to Margaritaville. I know what you're thinking - how can I give 4 stars to a soggy salad and an okay brew?  Trip two!  This time, I looked at the beer menu again...I saw the \"Black Velvet\" it has pear cider in it (not for me, thanks!), then I saw the \"Rose Gaarden\" - Hoegaarden White &. Lindeman's Framboise....delicioso! er umm...kostlich (delicious in German)  ;)  Loved it!  Two BIG thumbs up!  Then...I steered clear of the salads, and ordered their BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger...I took my first bite (white bun, burger, bacon, cheddar, garlic aioli, rum bbq sauce) OH MY!  My boyfriend is looking at me, and I can't stop nodding whilst chewing!  He reaches out, I hand him the burger, he takes a bite, and starts NODDING!  Thumbs up, that's an AWESOME burger!  Well worth the sticky hands the BBQ sauce installs.   Loved it, and we will be back for sure!!",

Second, the ceasar salad was the best I've had in a long time, chrispy roman, great tasty dressing, yummy.  I usually get the Mac and Cheese which is always awesome and went with Sirlon with Portobello Mushroom, Mashed Potatoes, and Grilled Tomato, it was worth it, and had it with a pretty good glass of beer with it..yum.  Server was really nice and allowed us to linger at the table after dinner for awhile.    Tasty meal for a cool winter Phoenix night!!",

    "text": "Let me first say that I LOVE Yardhouse. I have been to one in Las Vegas & Scottsdale & both locations were PHENOMENAL. I went to the Westgate Yardhouse this past Friday evening for my birthday dinner. It was slammed at 9pm but I didn't mind the wait for my favorite restaurant. We got a table 30 minutes later & our server was pretty quick to get us going with drinks and an appetizer. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp, my favorite app, & was definitely disappointed. The presentation was lacking, the shrimp were overcooked and lacking flavor, & the green papaya salad wasn't dressed. Every other time I have ordered this app the presentation, flavor, & salad were better. I figured since they were busy it wasn't too big of a deal. Then I got my entree, the ahi tuna salad. The tuna was delicious & I picked it out of the salad. The salad however was terrible. The flavor was extremely salty and flat. I was honest with the waiter about it and he told the manager who spoke to me and generously removed the salad from our bill. I really appreciated it since it was so inedible for me. I was excited for my lemon souffle dessert at first, but it took so long to come out I honestly wanted to leave before we even got it. Finally when it hit the table, it wasn't even hot. After waiting ALL that time for it I expected it to be burning hot. I was so disappointed with the entire meal but after complaining about my entree I didn't want to bother the manager again. Overall opinion: SKIP GLENDALE & GO TO SCOTTSDALE LOCATION",

I called and asked to make reservation on a Saturday at 7pm. Apparently, reservations are only accepted until 4:30pm on Friday and Saturday. That surprised me because most people are not even off work that early on Friday. I was offered that I could come early and try to get a table. Needless to say, if you are interested in just having a bite and a beer, this is a pretty good place. If you want to have more than a couple friends, expect a long wait or make your way elsewhere.",

The first time I went with a group of people and we all found that the service was some of the worst we had in memory. At one point we wondered if our waiter would ever come back. When he was there he was very unhelpful and the other people in my party especially were not pleased with him. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I thought the food was alright at the time, but I later ended up getting sick. However, after my negative experience I was contacted by the restaurant and they apologized and invited me back. I was actually pleased with their customer service and how they reached out to me, so I did come back for a second time and was glad I did.  My second visit was almost like eating at a completely different restaurant. We were even seated at the opposite end of where we were the first time. This time our waitress was excellent and did a great job of making sure we had everything we needed. We ordered new things this time around like their calmari, lobster crab and artichoke dip, and the vodka shrimp pasta. Everything was excellent and we couldn't get enough.  Needless to say I ended up being very glad that I came back for a second chance. I have no more complaints about the Yard House other than it being a bit expensive. In any case my wife loved it even more than I did, so I am sure we will be back to try it again.",

My rating is based on the time it took for our food to come out and the ratio of food to the price. The piece of chicken on the sandwich had to be about three ounces max for a $14 sandwich. It was good but I wouldn't order it again. The burger seemed to be the best value since it looked to be about 5-6 ounces of meat. In the future I might just visit for beers.",

If you're into seafood, you MUST try their crab crusted swordfish with wasabi mashed potatoes. Again, the only place I've found that serves swordfish.

We ordered the mini creme brulee that had bananas as a garnish and chocolate on the bottom. (I added a picture of it.) Great place to go to if you have the munchees!! Great service as well - you won't be disappointed.  **Side note - I was wearing my mom's watch which fell off and I didn't even notice until the hostess came and asked us if anyone was missing a watch.

The server was great and was knowledgeable of the beers and such. When I asked everyone what they would rate the yard house,  they all said five stars. If you are looking to eat then consider going here.",

The beer is priced like you would expect inside a major sports arena. In other words, very expensive.   The second trip was to try the food. I ordered the chicken rice bowl and honestly, I've had better microwave meals. The majority of the rice was very undercooked and hard as a rock. The flavors were bland at best.   I could forgive both the expensive beer and poor food quality if the service was exceptional but that is not the case either. While not the worst service I have ever had, I would expect much more based on the cost tier of this place. My entire group would wait for extended periods for drinks and trips to the table to see if everything was ok were nonexistent.   The location is great but I can't honestly recommend this place to anyone. There are just too many bars and restaurants in the area to make this one of your stops.",

And for a relatively cool evening in September, the views were much better from the outside.  Besides the views, the beers came a close second. Had 3 different ones on this evening. Sea Dog Bluepaw Wild Blueberry, Pyramid Apricot and Papago Orange Blossom. Yah, I wanted to make it a fruit themed beer evening.  For food, I chose the full rack St. Louis ribs with fries since my co-workers ate all the appetizers. And I was a bit hungry. Yes, this plate is huge, however the meat a bit dry. They did include some extra barbecue sauce, but you definitely needed more. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RtnTbhWYw4QjKhoTBV37OA?select=DNj4vVlJ1eD9XjT8ZlYGLQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/RtnT...</a>  They accidentally gave me some beans and corn as well for whatever reason. So they just piled on more food for just one person. It was like a feast. And again the views from the outside was great. It's like a mall here so you see everyone walking by visiting other restaurants or do some shopping here. Plenty of free parking too.",

    "text": "First and LAST time I'll ever go to Yard House  I went on a Monday night around 7:45 pm, the wait wasn't bad 10-15 minutes or so. The restaurant also wasn't super busy and our host even said that this was nothing compared to weekends. Our server was a woman who as she was taking our drink orders, said she was leaving and bringing another guy over to take care of us because she was being cut. That's fine and they said they were slow so i understood. The drinks were extremely syrupy and flat so I switched to water. The guy server was probably the least interactive and slowest waiter I've ever had. He was polite but we wouldn't see him for 10-15 minutes at a time. We had to flag him down for refills or sugar for tea. My table ordered spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer and we were thrown off by the plate. It was like 10 pita chips with Parmesan cheese on the chips with a bowl of warm spinach. I felt like I was eating straight up soggy greens. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado sandwich and a cup of tortilla soup. The soup was good but the sandwich was incredibly plain, messy, and tasted charred. I only at about 1/3 of the sandwich and didn't bother taking the left overs home. My friends got burgers and a French dip, they said it was alright but definitely not worth $13-$17.  It took ages to get our checks. I've never paid $40 bucks for a messy sandwich, water, and dip before so I was really annoyed at the price considering the taste and service, but whatever. I didn't have the exact amount so I paid with larger bills expecting my change back. The server came back and didn't even acknowledge me and only handed my friends their check because they paid with card. I felt too awkward to ask for my change back. I had planned on tipping him the standard percentage which would've been more than what he kept. I thought it was rude that he didn't bother asking but i didn't wanna cause a scene. I felt like if I was an older posh woman he wouldn't have been so hasty with the service. I didn't feel welcome from the get go and I definitely didn't feel good leaving.   Bleh food, poor service, weird music, fix your soda carbonation.",

As others have said, if you want beer, lots of variety and want to come back every day for for two years and never repeat your beer order, this is the place to visit.   If you want to have a party for the football season, or any type of sporting event, have it here, they offer a good variety of party platters, and it's not your regular wings and potatoe skins and fried veggies and cheese thingys.  Party platters offered:  Moo shu egg rolls,    Seared Rare Ahi Sashimi, Thai Chicken Noodle, Penne with Chicken and Peach apple cobbler just to name a few items.   A place like this, I could get use to going whether or not there's a sporting event going on.    I read there is at least one in Denver Colorado area if not two. I will definitely check it out.  Our server was very friendly and it was very relaxing to sit out on the patio for lunch.  We will definitely come back to the yard house, whether it's here or in Denver to see further what Yard House has to offer",

When I am in town here I love that I can walk from my hotel to this hot spot. Great staff, good food always consistent. I would like it if they added a meatball dish however but that is minor when you are considering a full menu of beers on tap.  Sometimes after I leave here I have drank far more than I ate... and... well... that's ok.",

My first time I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps, I think my problem was I was expecting it to taste like pei wei lettuce wraps. They were ok but pei weis are better. This time I got the beranise burger, thank goodness they put the sauce on the side because I was not a fan. The sauce was cold and was lacking flavor. The burger was good but not impressive. The highlight of the meal was the shoe string French fries. I ended dinner with the creme brulee, I loved that they put bananas on the top but then I was disappointed with the chocolate chunks on the bottom, it just threw off the flavor and texture. I don't know if I will be back. I love the idea of the meals on the menu, they are just not executed out well.",

Well, no hockey this night (1/25) so the place wasn't wall-to-wall crowded which was nice so we could enjoy dinner as well as drinks.  Our waiter seemed distracted and didn't bother to write down our orders, thus missing one of the appetizers our group ordered... and when we asked for it, blamed us as if we had not ordered it - sorry, don't think all four of us were wrong.  Not attentive service at all, and that is surprising considering I am aware that this place can be 'crazy-busy'.... food was a bit above average but nothing to 'write home about'.... Hey Yard House, maybe I'll give ya a try the next Coyotes game I get a chance to go to - it may have been an 'off' night for you!",

When I asked they said smoking allowed as long as its not within 20 feet of the door. The problem was it was within 5 feet of my food and no one else at my table smoked either. It been years since I have even seen a cigarette in any building, never mind a restaurant outside of China. If you don't want to eat your over priced food from what amounts to an ashtray, go somewhere else or ask to be seated out the range of your typical self centered cigarette smoker (or restaurant) that seems to have no idea that their stinky smoke travels great distances to visit those who don't smoke or want to inhale their second-hand smoke...",

This rating is solely based upon my experience and not the establishment itself, because I am a fan of the Yard House. I had a horrible snobb stick up his a** waiter! He seemed like life was miserable. I mean everyone else, including the manager was amazing so I am sorry to give such a low rating, but like I said, it is solely based on my experience with this one waiter. I only wish I got his name, so I could warn everyone not to get served by him! lol. He seemed as if he was so miserable and he was taking it out on us. Let's see, i'll describe him.

    "text": "I had dinner here (on Wednesday 1/22/14) with a corporate work group of 25-30 and enjoyed our evening so much that I had to write up a review! I initially worked with an MOD named Udo who was super helpful when I swung in the evening before to ask if he could accommodate our group on such short notice. Fortunately enough, he was familiar with the company I was with and gladly showed us the tables that they normally give us when a large group dines together. The tables were all separated (but were next to each other), which ended up being ideal when we all got to know each other in smaller groups.   Having worked in the industry for many years throughout college, I can't express how blessed we were to have received Chelsea as our server. Being the only individual in the group from Arizona, it was important to me that I show my new team the better spots around town and Chelsea totally owned the entire evening. She was friendly and had excellent menu knowledge for both food and drink and impressed the biggest of beers snobs in our group with the Four Peaks Odelay (great recommendation!) During the evening, Chelsea was always around to check on us even though we weren't her only tables and I was most impressed at how quickly she had all of our separate checks ready when the evening came to an end (corporate request for individual expense reports...annoying I know!). Chelsea made our evening flawless and my teammates absolutely loved the dinner selection! Having been so impressed, we all agreed that we would be back in a few months and YardHouse was where we will return! Having dined at another restaurant the evening before, it was a total 180-degree difference in the service and gratitude from the competing restaurant. I'm sure this location stays incredibly busy at the base of the stadiums but Chelsea single-handedly made 25 repeat customers that were eager to share their experiences the next day in our job-training!   I'd be remised if I didn't also mention the MOD the evening we dined in. I'm spacing on his name but he was a young brunette guy who checked on us repeatedly and ensured our evening went as perfectly as possible! Thanks to both of these individuals and if this makes it to corporate, I hope some compensation is sent their way! Thank you!",

    "text": "First visit to the Yardhouse on a non-home game Sunday...  Surprised at how much business they had at 3 in the afternoon but also encouraged by it.  This must mean the place is pretty good, right?  We started with two beers out of the 120+ they have on tap.  I had one of the Oktoberfest selections, the Beirweisen, which was light, earthy, and very tasty (especially with a squeeze of lemon).  The Main Man simply had the house Hefeweisen and reported it to be nutty, full bodied, and smooth.  We sampled some nachos (of course we did, the MM has to have nachos if they are on the menu) and they were very good, just about like we make 'em at home!  Momma had to dive in and swim around in the lobster, crab, and spinach dip... So much so that she cordoned off half the order and declared it would be placed atop her order of (Mac n Cheese)2... And really, I can't blame her, it was good shit!  You know what Momma ate for lunch and all I can say is that she gave me her rolling eyeballs and strange chewing smile that I think might be the same face she gives up during an orgasm.  So while its nice to know she enjoys the food, it's disconcerting at the same time.    MM had the burger with green chili and pepper jack and it was very, very, very good!  How can one go wrong with a whole, firm, grilled Hatch green chili sitting atop lean Angus on a fall day?  I had the Surf n Turf burger sans bun and I think I'm happy I eschewed the bun.  The asparagus is the perfect compliment to the full sized chunks of crab and lobster sitting on the Angus like a beauty queens crown!    Our server was friendly, warm, and polite.  She made sure we never wanted for anything... Thank you!  Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to even ponder desert, but we will be back and their molten lava cake is firmly in my sights!",

I ordered a skinny margarita and he got some unique beer; they have a HUGE drink menu with plenty of options. You should know that if you go here in the evening, there is probably going to be a wait. We probably had to wait 30-40 minutes. I recommend sitting out on the patio - it's lovely!  For dinner I ordered the kale and Brussels sprouts salad with grilled chicken. I know it seems boring but let me tell you, it's one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. I was practically begging to go back the next day just so I could order again.   We also got an order of the truffle fries which tasted like magic on my tongue. So much flavor! A little bit greasy but nevertheless delicious!   My boyfriend got a burger and he didn't seem to impressed. He considers himself a burger expert but I'm not sure about that.   Anyway I loved this place! Would definitely return.",

It was uncomfortable from that moment. Our waiter made the whole experience even more uncomfortable. He kept trying to joke with us, but it was very awkward. On a side note my vegan friend ordered the chips and guacamole. On the menu it did not state that the guac came with feta cheese on it. As a restaurant that offers vegetarian/vegan options, we were both shocked by this oversight. All of our food took a very long time to come out. Once our starters finally came out our waiter came by and jokingly asked if we were ready to order yet, making light of the slow service I suppose. Once our food finally came out we were underwhelmed to say the least. Our waiter also asked if we could taste the poison. I have never had a joke with me in such a manner, but the food was subpar, so the poison aspect was debatable. Also as a whole they seemed very disorganized. On two separate occasions food we had not ordered was brought to our table. On the bright side, the hostess and people at the front were very friendly. But because of the rest of the service I am obligated to rate this restaurant so low. Proceed with caution.",

I took my wife and myself out to dinner and was not disappointed. It is pretty pricey but it's located right in the middle of Westgate Entertainment District so that's to be expected. I'd give the place 4 stars but our server/host, Angel, made this place five stars! He went above and beyond to be accommodating to our very picky tastes and never seemed annoyed or distracted by it. Will definitely be back!",

I had the Chicken rice bowl which was good, and probably healthy, but after seeing some of the other plates, I wished I would have picked differently!  The fish and chips were delicious with crispy, tasty fries and lots of battered fish. The French dip was reportedly very tasty with those same crispy fries and the penne with chicken also got a firm thumbs up. There are lots of choices on the menu, an extensive drink list and the waitress was friendly and efficient. Great choice!",

Our food was served hot and really good. This was mine and my girls first time here and appetizers happened to be half off. (We came during happy hour) so we took advantage of that order their chicken fingers their onion rings stack and their mozzarella cheese bites. All really really good.

    "text": "My first visit here with the family was quite good.  It was evening and it was crowded.  We had to wait at the bar for a table so we enjoyed a cocktail in the electric sports themed lounge with TVs in every direction.  Service was pretty quick.  My wife tried one of their signature concoctions called an Upper Manhattan which is basically a Manhattan with peach puree.  She loved it and it's become one of her regular libations.    Once seated our server was very friendly and efficient.  Our food arrived reasonably quickly and we all enjoyed what we ordered.  I left on a positive note and looked forward to a return visit which happened about a week ago.  Our second visit was during the restaurant dead hour - just before 3 pm and happy hour.  We opted for an outside table which was nice despite the occasional disruptive breezes.  I ordered a cocktail . . . a regular Manhattan which I specified but apparently the young server was unfamiliar with this classic so I eventually received an Upper which is a tad too sweet for me.  I say eventually, because it took a very long time to get my drink and after the arrived, the waiter was no where to be found so I had to bring it back into the bar to ask the bartender what it was.  He confirmed it was an Upper but he cheerfully agreed to make me a standard Manhattan which was returned to our table liquidity split.  We placed our lunch order and regretfully, like my cocktail, it took forever to arrive.  If it hadn't been for the positive experience during our first visit, I might have downgraded my rating to 3 Stars but I know what this establishment is capable of so I presume the slowness in service was due to the hour of the day and changing of shifts.    I will say that our food was equally delectable as our initial visit.  I would definitely return here again but I would be more careful about the time of day for my next visit.",

My friends and I decided to stop for just deserts and got seated outside and was helped by a young man with dark hair and a bad attitude. As he was filling my water (because I'm very clearly pregnant and DD) he spilled it all over me and the table, not once but twice and he did this to more than one of us. We each ordered deserts & some drinks. As we're waiting we hear him very loudly complaining to his manager about how we're just doing desert. Him and the manager continued to stand out there and stare ya down for more than 2 full minutes. So we ate as fast as we could, and left.  The most recent-time weve gone we sat outside and had a great server, I believe her name was amber. The food came out great even in the height of a busy Saturday night. Really enjoyed it.",

I knew it was going to be more on the pricey side which is fine if I'm getting good quality food and service. The waitress was nice enough, but we waited quite a long time for two burgers, even longer for the fries since they didn't come out with the burgers. I got the Black Truffle burger and to my surprise got a puny, soggy, flavorless thing that resembled a burger. No lettuce, tomato, or onion, just a rather small piece of meat and cheese on a bun with three pickles on the side. I had to laugh. I could've gotten two way better burgers and a cocktail for a fraction of the cost somewhere else. No we didn't say anything to the manager or waitress because the service was okay like I said, but the food standards are obviously just low. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

We requested a few items and never got them. We understand that it may be scary to walk up to a table with girls your age but felt that she treated us differently. We also we watched her check on her other tables and cater to them and their needs nicely. We all are in the server industry and are highly disappointed in our service.

Service was ok our server messed up our order a little bit, but she was quick to correct it, but food was a little disappointing. They got a new appetizer added to the menu- pork lumpia which is Filipino eggroll, the ones you'd see served at every Filipino party. I'm Filipino, I know what these things are and have them often so I HAD to try them out here. I guess I was hoping for them to be super duper good and better than the ones I'm used to eating, but they're about the same as the ones my mom cooks lol. Safe to say I wasn't truly impressed, plus they are a bit pricey at $12 for like 7 eggrolls. I also ordered fish and chips and wasn't impressed with that either, the batter was near burnt and something in the tartar sauce was spicy. I also ordered truffle fries, but again sad to say it wasn't the same truffle fries I remember loving, they were darker in color than usual as if a couple more minutes in the fryer and the whole thing would've burned -- maybe they just need to replace the oil they used to cook? Anyway, I've had Yard House plenty of times before and know these guys can do better, but tonight just didn't cut it for me.",

    "text": "Do not order the Lobster garlic Noodles.  All the menu says is \"shrimp, crab, lobster, shiitake mushrooms, spinach, parmesan.\"  I love all of those things so I ordered it. My first bite was crunchy with bits of shell in the crab meat.  The pasta was extremely dry with no sauce to be found on the plate.   I mixed it all up and asked for more sauce from the waiter, but it was not salvageable.  My kids ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and their pasta was crunchy.  The waiter and manager were very nice about it and took my item off the bill without me asking. The manager explained that they had a lot of complaints about this dish.  I wish the waiter had warned me before I ordered it!  I'll just stick to a burger next time.  Everything else was just ok.  We were also charged for upgraded items without being told they were upgrades, but that happens if you don't ask questions. I gave it three stars because my wife liked her sandwich and the beer was good (but overpriced).  If not for the beer, I would have given it 1 star.",

I went when the Taylor swift concert was going on nearby so they were quite busy but seemed to handle it well. It has an abundance of seating and is vegetarian friendly. Our party of two was seated within 45 minutes despite the crowd. We went during happy hour time from 3-6pm so it was reduced price drinks and appetizers which was a great deal. We shared the cheese pizza, fried Mac and cheese and the Wisconsin cheese curds (lots of cheese items). They were all delicious. The Hawaiian mule was delicious and I highly recommend it.",

The restaurant is smaller so the bar is small. We always see a line so surprising got a table outside. Service was fast. We ordered beers and seared ahi. The presentation was beautiful but, when we took a bite of the fish, it was really salty. The sauce was a salt lick. Once we used the rice to soak the sauce off the fish, it was fresh and delicious. The waitress offered to replace the dish but had to go. The manager Brian also stopped by and asked if he can give us a to go meal. That was nice but we declined. Great service. And we will order the dish again with the sauce on the side.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, Yard House was a great restaurant! And then Darden got its hands on it... I've been a fan of the atmosphere, the beer selection, the service and especially the food, since the Westgate location opened several years ago. Darden swore they wouldn't mess with what was a winning concept. It's been some time since my last visit, but dinner last night has me believing that things have changed.  As a gesture of thanks to a good friend of mine, I offered to take him to dinner at Yard House. It looked busy, which is normal. So we weren't shocked to hear the wait was 45-50 minutes. In the meanwhile, we decided to do some shopping nearby. We walked about ten steps out the door and the pager went off (like 45-50 seconds later!)  We were seated quickly and greeted by Cody. This guy is good at his job. He is laid back, very efficient, has a great table presence and is very likable. What happened next wasn't his fault...  The drink order got a little confused but my company's White Russian did show up. We were starving, and Cody recommended the Chicken Nachos. They were pretty good and very generous, but far from the best appetizer I've eaten here. In the back of my mind, I kept thinking, Chicken Nachos shouldn't even be on the menu. And then our HUGE side salads arrived. Normally, I would overlook this. For $3.25, it's a deal. But, we agreed that they were both ordinary and way too big.  When both entrees arrived, they were barely at room temperature. I've never been served something that was so far from an acceptable temperature range. I couldn't even twirl the noodles. They were one big clump on the plate surrounded by room temperature pieces of seafood. And my friends entree sounded promising, but seriously?! How long does Mac and Cheese have to sit around to get this cold? Both entrees were returned to the kitchen. They were also very quickly replaced and delivered by one of the managers, Tim. Tim did comp the appetizer on our check, which was unexpected but nice.  I feel I'm being generous with four stars. Honestly, had it not been for the great service, this would've been a middle of the road three star review. Nice save Tim & Cody. Crossing my fingers that the Darden influence on the menu stays minimal at best. I will be back because I know Yard House is better than this.",

Our servers name was Ray and It has been years since I gave a small tip but I only left a 10% tip and a note saying the service was poor.  What happened: 1. For our appetizer it appeared he dropped a significant portion of the Calamari on the floor and had sloshed all the sauces out of their dishes. 2. I had asked for a half yard of beer and they brought out a pint. 3. We had to waive him down every time we needed something including drink refills. 4.  Their was a table with six young ladies that he spent an exorbitant amount of time to the detriment of good service to the other customers.  We will go to Yardhouse again but not if he is our server",

    "text": "Environment: Good size restaurant. Came in on Saturday night around 7:30pm and was able to get seated immediately. It does look like a busy place so it would likely be packed and take longer to be seated other nights.  Price: The price of this place is definitely on the higher end. I would be a happier if each dish would be $3-5 cheaper. Each entree average about $17 and up. My girlfriend ordered Fish and Chips (about $17), I order Ribeye and it was about $33 which is quite high compared to steakhouses such as Texas Roadhouse. $17 for Fish & Chips is quite overpriced, IMO.  Food: Food here was fantastic. The mashed potato was made perfectly. Even the broccoli were prepared differently. The meal was very satisfying. My girlfriend also enjoyed her food. The quality is about 4.5/5.  Service: The waitress was very nice. She was able to check in on us every 10-15 min. Great smile and welcoming.  Overall: I enjoyed my experience with this place. The total meal came out to be around $85 (2 Entrees + 1 Margarita + tips). So like I said before, it is definitely on the higher end. But if you are willing to spend some money for some good quality food, this is a great place for that.   Owner: If you are reading this, you should see other comments and it surrounds the pricing of the place being a bit too much. If you would consider lowering the price, I am sure your business will be even busier.",

    "text": "I honestly can't believe I haven't written a review for the Yard House at Westgate, yet.  Hubby and I have been here dozens of times, and have yet to not enjoy our meal.  The servers have always been friendly, the atmosphere is cool, the booths are comfy, the music is fun and the food has always been good.  We've had a lot of different things, so it's hard to pinpoint what we liked the best.  Hubby's main go-to is the Chicken Enchilada Stack or the Fried Chicken dinner with gravy.  I have liked the pork loin, the burgers (turkey, lamb and sliders) and the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  We also enjoy their hummus starter...tasty and just enough to get us going while we wait for our entrees.  They're open late, which is always a plus...and the place is huge, so even when it's crowded, it's nice.",

I am pretty stuck on the Sushami but order something else also. Today it was a new type of taco the called the demon taco. I had the blackened fish taco \"demonized\" in which they use an encrusted cheese tortilla. It was GREAT! They were out of the beer I wanted and gave me a taster of another as I was making up my mind for the replacement. I ordered the taster then they apologized for it taking to long and the first was on them they said. Afterward I went to the outlet mall and got what I needed. I headed back over and asked for some more water which they gladly served me. I told them my water had gotten hot and they invited me to bring my bottle in, they filled it, and chilled it in their refrigerator. So I had another beer, a great conversation, and chilled water when I left. Thanks!!!",

Ordered a ribeye with shrimp, but the shrimp were undercooked and still cold. I told Amber who was very understanding and she took it back to the sous chef. We were at a table that could see the kitchen and I watch the sous chef stick his bare ungloved hand on my steak and shrimp, then gave it to the cook to reheat. I told Amber what I saw and if she could just remove the plate from our tab as I lost my appetite seeing that. The sous chef continued touching everyone's food after wiping his head, touching his hair, and went was handling everyone's food without gloves. The manager came to talk to us about what happened and I told him what I saw. He quickly went to the kitchen and the sous chef put gloves on immediately (which were hanging right in front of him). At the end of our dinner the manager had compt out whole ticket (which I did not ask for but welcomed it lol). He gave us a 25$ gift card to come back but I think this is our last time. I just want to make it clear our server Amber was GREAT and did everything in her power to rectify the situation. I applaud her for that and the manager for stepping in to handle the situation. It's clear their kitchen needs work but the front of house is TOP NOTCH and the reason they got 3 stars instead of 1.",

They have a Gardein burger and sliders (omit the cheese and special sauce), which comes with fries. They also have Gardein \"wings\" in a variety of different flavors. The sliders & wings are on the Happy Hour menu, so from 3p-6p, M-F, they are nearly 1/2 off.  They have pasta options as well but I've never tried those. They've also added more veggie appetizers, like a cauliflower dish & a Brussels Sprouts & Potato dish. I don't know what sauces these are cooked with (haven't tried them) so make sure you inquire with the chef or manager (not the waiter) before ordering.  Food was fresh, yummy, and nicely presented. We had good table service. It was perfect for a pre-concert dinner. (Gila River Arena is only @ 100 feet away.)  If you're shopping or headed to a concert in this Westgate area, there aren't many options for vegans. Yard House is a solid choice, particularly when dining with omnivores.",

It's a little more high end than other places, but you can get a very good deal if you come in during HH, which is 3-6PM M-F and 10PM-close Sun-Thu.   For my non-alcoholic beverage consuming friends, fear not, Yard House has a lot of yummy appetizer options on their HH menu. For beverages, I get a Roy Rogers (Coke, grenadine, and maraschino cherries), which is super delicious and great for the designated drivers out there :).   As far as appetizers go, I recommend their truffle fries ($5, not on HH special), fried calamari ($7), ham & pineapple pizza ($6), and their chicken lettuce wraps ($7). All of the food is delicious, reasonably priced, and great for sharing with friends or family while enjoying some beverages of choice (alcoholic or otherwise!)",

And most importantly delicious food, at a moderate price. I enjoyed a dish of fresh shrimp with the Belgian ale 6 shot sampler. I was in Heaven! My pallet was too! Just another fun feature of the very cool West Gate entertainment complex. I highly recommend this place when visiting there.",

Your taste buds will have a new bar to jump over when trying to compare entrees for lunch or dinner with other places.  My favorite: SEARED AHI CAESAR seared rare, hearts of romaine, parmesan crisps, croutons and egg free caesar dressing.  I feel so appreciated as a customer because when you check on on foursquare they tweet you back and thank you for visiting.   I hope other restaurants are reading this and take note... with the fight for the consumer discretionary dollar making the customer feel good bring repeat and referral business!    Don't be put off by the name....come even if you don't drink because it is so much more than a bar to get a yard of beer!   The service is great food is fantastic!  Must try you will be happy!",

Our waitress was very nice and the seating was fast, however I could tell she was reiterating a script about how they're known for their beers, it came off as very nonchalant. However our drinks were never empty and she did make good suggestions as to what to order. My boyfriend ordered a burger medium rare, and it came out very far (wish I had a picture) the fries also seemed very bland and as if they were Mae for little kids. I ordered rib nachos which sounded and looked better than they tasted. It came with what they call \"red sauce\" and just seemed like they didn't fit the platter. Also they arranged everything on the plate into piles I.e clumps of cilantro then a clump of red sauce. The rib strips were cut very huge to where one rib couldn't even fit on one chip. Honestly I could make these tacos at home which is why I would not return here, paid $10 for tortilla strips and shredded cheddar cheese.",

When the food came out, there was a small amount of fries, but the server said he would bring me some fresh ones. They were OK, but of course the fresh ones were better, especially with some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. The toppings on my pizza tasted good, but the crust seemed tougher than I remember. For dessert, we shared the S'mores Brownie. It was bigger than I expected and came out in one of those pizookie pans. And it was scorching hot! You really had to blow on the marshmallow so you didn't burn your mouth. It was a VERY sweet, sugary dessert. We only ate about half of it before calling it quits.",

I like that I can always find a great Belgian beer at YH. They have happy hour Mon-Fri until 6pm that includes both food and drink specials. The onion rings are pretty fantastic, and I've never been disappointed by their pizzas. My bf loves the mac n cheese, and their peppercorn steak.

Garin, the restaurant manager, saw that we had been sitting for 10 minutes without a server and he came over and apologized profusely. He allowed us to choose 3 beers each to sample (normally you can only have 2). He personally brought them to us and then told us he would be comping us our Brussels sprout appetizer which was to die for. Before we had even finished our first round of beers he brought out 2 more beers and said they were also on the House! Wow if I lived in AZ I would drive across the state for this kind of service. Unfortunately I live in Indiana but whenever I come back to AZ I will for sure be back!!!",

We started with the deviled eggs - not something you see on most menus.  They were quite tasty.  For dinner, I ordered the Ahi sandwich and hubby had a burger.  Both pretty good, but we probably could have shared just the fries from one of the sandwiches and even then still had plenty left over.  There were a lot of fries....and they're matchstick fries, which aren't my favorite.  Service was very good.  Andrew was friendly and attentive, and after we told him about all the moving and unpacking we'd been doing, he made sure to keep the beverages coming (non-alcoholic, he wasn't trying to get us drunk.).

How many place have you been to where they have more than 100 different beers on tap?!?! This place have amazing beers, that's a given! HAHA The food here is very very good. I can never get enough of this place.   The atmosphere is very up scale and trendy. The bar area has plenty of televisions if your looking to catch the game for a drink with some friends. The dinning area is dimmed in lighting with plenty of room for small or large groups, offering table or large booth seating.   Last time I came here is got the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter off the tap, and ordered some boneless wings off the appetizer menu. The wings were awesome! Great flavor with a moist textured chicken meat.   The bartender asked if I would like to sample some other beers on tap that I haven't tried. I asked him what is the most common one that other using want to sample.He mentioned that the raspberry framboise was the most common. It's higher then any other beer in alcohol content with a fruiting taste, served in a goblet glass. I did try it and it was very good. I will probably order it next time I stop in!  I have always had great experiences while eating or drinking at the Yard House.   FYI: You cannot get a yard of beer! I tried! HAHA",

You will find something you undoubtedly like. Ditch the domestics and shoot for a rare brew you're not gonna find anywhere else on tap. This is absolutely the most extensive draught selection in the West Valley, with everything from the sharp Green Flash IPA to the sweet Blanche de Bruxelles.   Need some food to soak that up? Don't worry, the menu has got ya covered. Especially during happy hour. This place has one of the best app menus you'll find. The wings have just the right amount of heat. The pizzas are a steal--I recommend the Thai BBQ Chicken. For my vegetarians in the house, there are some options for you, too, whether it's mock-meat or straight up mushrooms and veggies.   A small criticism I have would be the entrees, which never quite seem to hit the spot. Like the seemingly unseasoned burgers. I can't really endorse the several choices I've made outside of the app menu (well, besides their famous mac 'n' cheese). This place masters bar food, but can't seem to tackle the sit-down restaurant realm.   Overall, I'd recommend this place for a date, or to chill out with some beer snobs and have a quick nosh. Patio seating is a blast!",

Both of those dishes are easily separated to split with friends if you are stopping by for a light meal.    The beers on tap can't really be matched and if you're too indecisive like me, just order a flight and try several!  This location has ample seating and even though the place was packed, we did not have any issues getting service.  This is a great overall spot to enjoy a lazy afternoon with the water fountain nearby for kids to play and shops to walk around, as well as other eateries and places for dessert.

    "text": "I was excited to celebrate with family here after a big event but was very disappointed with the zero vegan options. I was looking for a fun dinner experience with large menu diversity and many beers on tap. It seemed that yard house fit the bill. I glanced at the huge menu on line and figured I could find something to eat. I am a vegan but my entire family isn't so I wanted a big menu and I could make it work right a soup or a salad ? Nope I asked the waiter if they had any vegan options he told me \"we are not vegan friendly not even close\" I asked what about salad he stated no we make all our dressings in house none are vegan milk or cheese in everything  except what I ordered:  I ordered Gardien orange chickn with vegetables and brown rice it was disgusting horrible sauce I took a nibble and sent it back it was so spicy and tasted nothing like orange sauce. Gross  Vegans be aware don't go here they don't want your business easier if you stay away they don't care  Sadly I had a beer and a few onion rings then  later found out the deep fryer is not vegan   I won't return",

From the atmosphere, to the well-trained employees, to the great selection of food, and although I'm not a drinker the amazing variety of spirits. If you're in the area, I strongly recommend that you give this restaurant top priority on any informal gathering. The music is lightly there are TVs with Sports playing throughout the entire restaurant.  The number of positive reviews on this site is what led me there, take your time and read a few of these and you'll be hooked.",

There were three of us and so we tried the firecracker wings (which I had eaten before and are fantastic); onion ring tower (they honestly were kind of soggy) and the pastrami sliders (they were decent, but the pastrami had no spice/flavor really).  The draft selection at this restaurant chain is crazy - always too many to pick from.  I would definitely go back to try some more of the appetizers and maybe the other 100+ beers I have yet to try!",

Unfortunately, I was just visiting a friend and can't go here on a regular basis but I will be back as soon as I can. We were here in the middle of the afternoon for a late lunch and it wasn't busy at all, but I can imagine the place is just packed during dinner time, or at game time. I ordered the burger with Gorgonzola cheese and was very pleased with it. A little expensive for a burger, but it was delicious. Besides the price, our only complaint was that they didn't give us enough of their delicious french fries!",

Very well spoken and courteous. The food was great. A bit pricey. And, would like to see some kind of a dress code enforced. The feeling of fine dinning quickly disappears when you see people in sweat pants and hoodies. If there were some kind of small dress code and a bit cheaper it would be an easy 5 stars.",

The Yard House has the best drink selection around, especially if you like beer and a dining selection so wide it has something for everyone.  The only drawbacks are is it almost always feels crowded and occasionally with the influx of people the service sometimes slips, and the food and drinks seem a bit overpriced for what you are getting - but otherwise it almost always provides a great dining experience.",

    "text": "This is my first review so I'll probably keep this fairly short.  The Yardhouse is my favorite restaurant/bar for trying different drinks so far. I've only been 21 for five months but haven't found a single bar yet that has a selection quite like them.  The pints aren't usually an excellent price, but the diversity of drinks is too good to pass up. The service is good 3/5 times I am there. Last time I was there I was with a large party and the waitress never came back with my drink order. Another waitress came to take my order and she didn't show up either. Finally someone came and delivered my drink after a half hour. By this time most my party was ready to head into the movie theatre across the way and was only able to drink one beer.   Like I said, the service is usually great, but they can get swamped and forget about you.  Unless there's a huge sporting event on they're always willing to change the channel for you to a different sporting event. If you go a little later when the bar isn't swamped the bar tenders are all really chill and will tell you if a beer isn't really that good.  The food is average quality. Nothing to go raging to your friends about. The streaky service and decent food is what kept me from giving it five stars.",

The service was okay - lots of up selling attempts. No mention that the soup was not an even swap with fries, but shrug. At $20 with tip, way too much for me for a return visit for what I got.
