I finally had the time, so I jetted down to the restaurant and I had a really good time.  The service here was great.  I was greeted and seated immediately, and decided that lunch was the way to go for me.  I like the fact that they serve breakfast here until 2PM, because sometimes I DO want breakfast at noon!  They also have happy hour daily from 3-7 which is awesome as well.  No need to rush after work.  Just do happy hour on a Saturday!  Anyways, I went with the burger, and surprisingly, they have a variety of sides to choose from.  I \"like\" french fries, but am always looking for something more at times.  Sometimes I want a salad instead, or soup, and BLD gives you that choice.  Instead of fries, they have 4 or 5 choices to go with.  I went with hummus.  It was delicious!  Nice change of pace from fries.  Anyways, its a bit of a drive, but a nice alternative from the ordinary.  Lovely decor, spacey with lots of good food to choose from.   I will be back!",

And that's saying something. The watermelon was absolutely rancid, it smelt nasty and tasted foul. The early bird hash was absolutely disgusting. It was inedible with some cheese byproduct that destroyed the meal. The over-medium eggs were super running past the point of over-easy. Only thing that was good was the eggs Benedict that my grandmother got (thank goodness since it was her birthday breakfast). But I don't think we'll be coming back. Pretty disappointed in the meals.",

My wife and I go here often until last Wednesday. I got my usual bld burrito and was packing up my left overs when I started to pour my sauce on my burrito there was a sucked/chewed on mint in my sauce! Seriously like the prep cook lost the mint while making the sauce and couldnt find it so just kept on making the sauce! Well it was in my food.. I was in shock that this was actually happening so we brought it to the bartenders attention and all he did was make jokes about it.. then he comped my meal and made us pay the rest of the bill... I couldn't believe what was going on. I was so unbelievably grossed out because this was pretty much somebody spitting in my food. I couldn't believe this was how this situation was handled.. no manager came over nothing! As soon as I walked out of their doors I began to throw up from being so grossed out. Later that day I tried to email the owners/managers and days later I have yet to hear one single word from anybody! Which is even worse for being a privately owned establishment you would think that somebody would respond.. I will never return to this establishment again and i will most likely be contacting the Heath department about this.. it is SO GROSS and unsanitary of a place!",

The server said \"ok let me see if he will take them off, I'm not sure that he will\". Who says that??? Of course he will take them off, it's a $7 item and it's called customer service!  The racks were excellent.  The Ahi was overseasones and fairly decent. What try served it with made no sense from a culinary standpoint.

They do have some local beers but no porters or stouts :(  For lunch I ordered the green chili pork tostada.  Overall an okay flavor but the salsa drowned out the flavors of the pork and the black beans.  A little less sauce might have created the balance I was looking for in this dish to make it lovable.  Still looking for something to love I ordered the chocolate pudding cake.  My first few bites really excited me:  the flavors well balanced and none overpowering the rest.  Then I hit the portion of the cake that was burned.    Overall this establishment shows a lot of promise.  I look forward to trying other options here.",

We were seated right away though and the staff was friendly, the service timely, and the food outstanding! I had the Rigatoni Con Carne and my wife had the meatloaf. I'd probably wash dishes for a week to get the recipe for mine and the meatloaf was just about as good based on the one taste I had and what my wife had to say about it after (I know right ... meatloaf?!).

Only critique would be was that the croissant was a little dry.  I had the potato salad for the side, and it was ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT.  It was very flavorful, rife with fresh mustard seed and the potatoes were prepared perfectly.  My wife had the Grilled Chicken Club.  It was a whole breast of chicken, with bacon, lettuce, tomato, dijonaise on Sourdough, and she found it to be excellent.  She had the onion rings, which she was not so fond of, but the kids absolutely loved them.  They appeared to be beer-battered and quite fresh.  Service was a little slow--I would've expected the lunch to be a little quicker on the waiter service.  I didn't mind the wait for the food, but the wait for my check was kind of annoying.  Overall, I had a fantastic lunchtime meal here.  Value for the money was perfect.

We weren't expecting that type of response. Anyway, needless to say we won't be back. The food today was burnt, and had a bug in it. The service today by Linda was good. She was nice, and very apologetic.  Bridget, and the girl the brought out the food on the other hand may need a little more training on customer service.",

It comes with a bean and cheese quesadilla that is oh so delicious!  I like to add on their green chili pork, which definitely adds to the dish and they certainly don't skimp on adding it on!  My boyfriend is a huge fan of their breakfast burrito.  He says it's hands down one of the best breakfast burritos he's ever had.  I don't come too often for lunch since I'm not often in the area at that time, but I do love their onion rings.  They are huge and super yummy with a little hint of sweetness.  For dinner I've had a few of their dishes.  Their menu changes from time to time, which is nice, but at the same time can be a little sad to see some of your favorite dishes disappear.  Lately I've been a fan of the chicken fried steak.  You get the crunch on the outside, but it was still really juicy on the inside and had a great flavor.   The only reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is because I don't feel like every dish I've had has been a total winner.  I've had a few that I've just found okay, but nothing that has been terrible.  However, when they do hit the mark (at least for me) with a dish, it's just phenomenal and you can't help but to just enjoy every bite you take.",

For the price and the hype, I was expecting an outstanding, fluffy, and detectable omelet with some great tasting potatoes on the side. Instead, I got an omelet that was smaller than the what I make at home, bland, and lukewarm. The potatoes -the ones I could eat, anyway- were downright cold. Most of them were so burnt and hard, I couldn't even eat them. There was no seasoning on anything. I only gave them 2 stars because I'm taking into account we drove to another location to eat, and possibly the food wasn't as cold when they handed it to us as when we got home. Considering we had to wait for them to get our food ready-I can say for sure the temperature wasn't because the food was ready and we were late getting there to pick it up.  However, I've eaten a lot of take out in my life and I've never had food quite that cold before. Though the atmosphere inside looked fun and inviting,  I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "Had an urge to go to our favorite spot today, but we're breakfast people and love finding new places, so we ended up at BLD. Waited about 5 minutes for a table, friendly waitress,  busy at 10:30. I asked for a menu to look at while we waited, YIKES!!! The prices were expensive, I asked my BF if he wanted to stay, we still had time to sneak out before they called our name but as soon as he was about to speak our table was ready. We couldn't back out now... still scouting out the overly priced menu after being seated, I finally decided on The Breakfast Burrito. Even our waiter recommended it, said it was his favorite out of everything on the menu. My BF ordered a simple stack of pancakes. We were sitting and talking, and we were in the booth that had the lovely kitchen view. I was watching all the food coming out, it all was coming out decently fast and I happened to see a burrito and a plate of pancakes pop on the line. Now, I kept an eye on it. I don't care for cold food, no one does. It's just sitting there. It then gets picked up and put on the serving line. It just sits there. I seen our waiter, oh yes! He's getting our food, wait, no... someone else's order he is delivering. A young boy then picks up what seems to be our order but follows our waiter, that was someone else's order, whew!, no cold food. But wait, I kept my eye on him, that was our order he carried across the restaurant, turned back around and proceeded back to us. Man... oh well, someone had to be at work so we just started eating. Mine was warm, was expecting hot, the pancakes were decently hot. A scant side of butter and syrup was served for the size of these mediocre pancakes. A side of green salsa was served with the burrito. As I ate, the first few bites were delicious but as I continued eating I felt like I was eating a greasy meal the more I consumed, I think it was the meat, and the amount of cheese, there was a lot of both but I didn't want to waste it for the price it was costing. It was good but not great, the potatoes were the best part. As I said above, the pancakes were mediocre. For how expensive this place is for breakfast, I don't think we'll be back. I'm still debating if it was worth the stop. When you have a feeling to go to your normal breakfast spot but also want to try something new, I'd go with your first choice.",

    "text": "I'm having an internal debate over my review.  Did I like it 3 stars or 4 stars?  I can't make up my mind.  I have been here twice.  I agree with other posters that it's refreshing to have new places (non-chains) in Chandler.  So I give it props for that.  The staff is super friendly, awesome really.  I went in there with the kids, and they were great with kids too.  The place is open, clean, big tables and a nice \"bar\" table.  Trendy, good.  Our food the first day was pretty good, I think my chicken sandwich was the only not-so-exciting dish, but my husband liked his, and so did my kids and friend.  And the portions were pretty big.  The green pork chili is gigantic.   And then 2 days later I went there for breakfast by myself.  Ah, an escapade from work and family.  Again, I love the actual place, it was so bright in there.  But that day the service was not quite as awesome...the waitress kept helping the table behind me (friends I think) and ignoring me, so eventually I had to stuff my face to be able to eat and make it to work on time.  I got the spaniard omelette.  Ok, I'm biased here...since I'm spaniard.  So this may come accross as a snooty review...but cilantro!!!  That's one herb that's not used in spanish food at all.  You got it wrong, chef. It should be parsley, sorry.  Actually, the parsley would have given flavor to the omelette, which was just blah.  Eggs and cheese.  Yes, the cheese was manchego and therefore flavorful.  Also, the saugage in the omelette is portuguese...not spaniard!  Sorry, picky, I know.  But there's wonderful spanish chorizo available out there, that adds incredible paprika flavor to eggs (I make this a lot), so please find some!   Oh, yeah, and my coffee didn't get refilled when the mug went empty...what gives???",

To me the prices seemed really good for the quality of food I asked and they use fresh and local products suppliers and you can taste that difference.  Loved the bfast burrito with short ribs for the meat and fam loved the fried chix and waffles!  Dinner was equally good loved the pork and polenta with cheese fam liked all they had.  Service was prompt cheerful and professional.  Recommend them and definately be back.",

    "text": "Upon arrival, we were immediately seated and greeted by the hostess. But unlike the friendliness of the hostess our server was very rude. She walked up to the table and said , I quote, \"What do you wanna drink\" no greeting what so ever, didn't tell us her name or  asked us how we were, just what do you want. After receiving our waters she said \"Are you ready?\" And its not what you say sometimes but the tone you say it in, and it wasn't a very friendly tone. I ended up getting a burger and asked for medium rare, and repeated again that I wanted a little pink and a refill on my water. When I received the burger it was definitely well done, and i had also spilled my ranch. So I sat there and waited for the server for a little while, I wanted to ask to get my burger redone and for some more napkins to clean the mess but she never came by. So after a while of waiting and my Friend being half way done with his food, I decided to eat some of it . I Only ate Half of my burger because it just wasn't that good and cold by then because I had waited so long trying to get my waitresses attention. And to top it all off i still had no water! I had to drink from a warm water bottle in my purse. So I ended up sitting next to spilled ranch, having no water, a wrong made burger, plus no customer service for my whole first experience at BLD.              I'm writing this email in hopes that there is change in the way things are done in your restaurant in the future. I was very excited to eat at your establishment for my birthday lunch and my whole visit was a disappointment and regret. Worst Birthday lunch ever. After all of this, i wrote to the manager and never even heard a response.",

Today my husband and I went for breakfast, our waiter hardly took the time to listen to our order, brought me the wrong late twice (pumpkin spice late came as chi - gross! where was the espresso?) finally I said I would like a cup of just plain coffee.  My husband got his eggs benedict and enjoyed them, I had a waffle but unfortunately I had to ask for butter and syrup because they brought it plain - really?  My coffee finally came when our food arrived, my waffle got cold as we had to wait a while for the butter and syrup.  Topper of this, the waiter never came to check how the food was or if we wanted anything else, left the bill and made a point to show us by circling the \"credit\" that was given for the late!  Great, we didn't pay for what wasn't made right and we didn't consume but then charged us for the cup of coffee that came late?  Disappointing!  BLD can be good but the lack of consistency with their food and service is less than desirable.  We will not be going back for a while",

This review is for breakfast only as I've never been here for lunch or dinner. Their BLD breakfast burrito is my absolute favorite thing on the entire menu. At $13 a pop it might seem a little pricey for a breakfast burrito, but you're easily getting two meals worth of premium ingredients - this things is HUMONGOUS. It's easily 50% super tender and delicious short rib, finished off with eggs, potatoes, roasted red peppers, avocado and pepper jack. The green salsa that is comes with is fresh and delicious, albeit a bit mild. I wish it had a little more of a kick to it, though there is Cholula readily available on the table to customize your spice level. The buttermilk fried chicken and waffles are also really good, as is the green chili pork tostada. Service is always pretty hit or miss, but generally pretty efficient. We did sit on the patio once and asked if the heaters could be turned on, and neither of the people working at the time knew how to work them. Oh well, their patio is also dog friendly, and last time I brought my lab puppy the server was nice enough to bring him some water and a treat! He was over the moon. My only request would be to bring back the morning happy hour specials!",

My husband knocked on the door for about 5 minutes, even though the two girls at the bar kept turning and looking at him, finally a guy opened the door and started to go through his wallet and handed my husband a card that a manager would give to an employee for doing a good job.

Needless to say, we will not be going back to this establishment ever again and most definitely are filing a complaint and fraud charges with our bank for them charging my card and not refunding it since they did not do our order.",

    "text": "The best part of our breakfast dining experience was our server. He was very friendly and attentive. The quality and food portions do not match the prices. The Hawaiian french toast was good, but not great and not very warm. The scrambled eggs were requested extra dry, and they weren't, and the avocado served with it was almost ripe, but still rubbery. The tomatoes were delicious. Yes, we could have sent the food back, but we were starving and had an appointment to make, so we ate what we had. I was very disappointed in the $6.50 regular-sized coffee cup of pumpkin chai latte. It didn't zap my tastebuds with pumpkin spice flavor, so IMO, not worth the cost. I would say BLD is ok, but probably not some place I would return to in the near future for breakfast.",

She explained the menu and specifics of each dish I had questions about. The prompt and courteous service will certainly bring me back again for many meals to come.

Once the waitress brought the salad I noticed there were no strawberries but pineapple instead.  The waitress didn't even mention it, but once I asked where were the strawberries she said \"oh we are out of strawberries so we use pineapple now.\"  Hmm okay then.  My coworker got the BLD burger and it looked okay, but was a sloppy gooey mess to handle.    Service was slow for a non-crowded time and waitress never brought extra dressing for salad but still charged me for it.  I would probably go back for happy hour or on the weekend for brunch, but experience was very forgettable and overpriced for the quality.",

The unanimous talk after the meal was about the the heavy handed slating of many of the dishes people ordered. Yes I hang with foodie friends and we discuss meals in great depth.   We were here for a friends Birthday Party, while advanced reservations were not possible, we lucked out and sat 15+ around a giant high top table that dominates on section of the dining space. There are also booths normal tables a patio and a bar.  At the bar you will find a decent selection of local beers, from san tan, four peaks and even sleepy dog. They also offer larger 20oz glasses. There was a decent looking happy hr menu I would give a try.  I was not too hungry and oped just for the seared Ahi app $9. It came with some green but flavorless hummus and equally bland chips, the two things here that lacked salt. The Ahi was of decent quality and the searing was good, the middle did seemed a bit more cooked that I expected and yes there was an excess of salt. This also came with a dollop of cucumber red onion salad. Over all it was decent, nothing special.  I did sample some of my friends items, the onion rings side was good, but do I need gourmet onion rings, The mac and cheese was nothing special either.  If you are in the mood for comfort food in a fancy setting and don't mind the brineyness of old pirate you may like this place.",

The bartender, I don't know her name, was quick on her feet and great with all of the customers.

Even my child's captain crunch nuggets are great!  My hate relationship is the service. My waitress is extremely nice but not good at customer service. First time she messed up my order & I had to wait 10 mins to let her know it's not what I order. She apologized then rushed a new order, which later came out burnt! I couldn't eat it. Everyone at my table agreed it was burnt. I would had told her it was burnt but she never came back to check on us. I tried my friends others dishes and they were good!   Last weekend I actually went again. Same waitress btw. My salad was wrong which she corrected but never checked on us. We waited 20 mins for our check, that's after we finished eating. I'm sure if I had just walked out no one would have noticed. But I don't dine & dash.   I will continue to go there for the great food but I will just stick to sitting at the bar probably. Nice decor as well. Nice atmosphere. Check it out for yourself. Hence my love hate relationship why I have three stars.",

I had the build your own omelet and it was cooked perfectly (not too tough!) The fried potatoes w onions were crisper than I prefer but decent.  The side of pineapple delicious and fresh.  My Chai tea with skim milk was perfect as well. Another in our party loves the sausages as a side,  nice crisp \"break\" in the skin as you bite in.  His English muffin slightly over done but raspberry jam made up for it.  Decore fun, pretty loud with open concept (& clever bathroom sink set-up!).

Ribs, sausage, brisket, pulled pork, cornbread, baked beans, potato salad, coleslaw, rolls and four different flavors of bbq sauce. I was amazed with how well they packed the food. I had planned to move the food into my own crockpots and heated serving platters but there was no need. We just popped the tops of the containers and the hot stuff stayed hot. I usually spend hours prepping food and cleaning dishes after I have events, not this time. Clean up was a breeze. When we first opened the food I thought we had ordered way too much but the food was such a hit basically everyone went back for seconds. So we only had a few leftovers, unfortunately :-). The guy that took our catering order helped us order just the right amount. I am very thankful to the chefs and staff that made this order so perfect for us. I will prob be having more events and gatherings now that I know how much nicer it is with catering. Oh and the best part of all was the price! I couldn't have made all that food for that price.  thanks BLD!!",

We visit BLD often in last 5 years, and we were super disappointed with our recent dinner experience on Friday.  Something is not right.... Arrived 7pm, no hostess, only a few servers and tables.   We sat at bar.  Bartender was the Manager on duty.  Very nice guy, served drinks quickly. Ordered dinner even though our \"gut\" told us to have a drink only and go elsewhere for food.  Ordered a burger and salmon risotto.  Burger was bloody raw inside (turning the bun red with blood, btw he never asked how we wanted it cooked), and it had incorrect garnishes.  Salmon was crispy black burnt, and risotto was sitting in a pool of oil.  We took 3 bites of each entree and were done.  Manager kindly offered to fix it or buy us an appetizer or dessert, but we weren't interested and just wanted the 2 meals we didn't eat removed from our bill.  Instead only the burger was taken off the check and we still had to pay for the most expensive entree, the salmon.  We walked to a different place nearby for dinner. We will give BLD another try because we have loved it for the past 5 years.  I hope this was just an off night for them.",

Little things like the amount of chips they give you with the dip trio VS the amount of dip, show their lack of attention to detail.  There are barely enough chips to finish one dip, let alone 3.  The food was also a let down on both occasions.  It was under-seasoned, and poorly executed.  The guacamole was mediocre at best.  The hummus was the highlight in the dip trio, and still not great.  The \"meatball hoagie\" I ordered the second time was more like a sloppy joe sandwich.    The Mac and Cheese was bland, and under-seasoned.  They are taking classic comfort food dishes, and actually making them worse in an attempt to class them up.  Additionally I wish they served breakfast items, for dinner.  Actually everyone I was with, on both occasions felt the same way.  The service we had was good, and probably one of the only positives I can give B.L.D at this point in time.  I am a BIG fan of Cork, and go there frequently, so I had high hopes for this place.  I will not be returning until I see the reviews on here start to change for the positive.",

I think the breakfast pricing is a little steep ($15+ with entree and coffee).  The dinner pricing is more reasonable but still over $25 for entree and 1 drink.  I guess I just do not feel like this restaurant is very special.  I'm not sure if it is the cold setting as another review suggested or the impersonal staff.  Somehow, I am not drawn to go back.  If you are in Chandler and need a clean restaurant with reliable food, BLD is still a good choice.  Just don't expect to be wow'd.",

A little overpriced, but everything is these days.

I ordered chicken and waffles and the Bo ordered a breakfast burrito.  Our meals took around 25 minutes to come out and my boyfriend even commented saying how all the people sitting next to us NO ONE had a plate in front of them.  Sunday must have been a new employee training day because there was so many kids wandering around and around the restaurant with no real task at hand.  The coffee.... the coffee was good.  Then, FINALLY our food came out.  My chicken was good and it was a baked chicken breast breaded.  My waffle was HALF a waffle.  Two pieces came out and they were toasted cajun style (like a brick) i think they were seasoned with a pepper or something too?  My scrambled eggs came out already mixed with syrup.  Boy's burrito came out on a green pita wrap tortilla and carne mixed with eggs and some avocado on the side.  The \"carne\" or meat had a lot of fat on it.  Breakfast was $30.  I wont be back.",

First off they had fresh squeezed orange juice on the menu and I had to have a glass a small for $2.50, but to my disappointment it wasn't!!  Trust me when I say I know fresh squeezed!!  Second off my favorite dish is the short rib benedict and it always came with red wine hollandaise, and now it comes with brown gravy...WTF??  So I switched to the traditional benedict.  I was disappointed that the normally amazing hollandaise had absolutely no flavor to it, the potatoes had no flavor...it was like they didn't season anything today.  Also the normally fresh shaved ham was now some crappy sliced deli ham.  Needless to say I wont be going back for a while again, sorry to say as it has potential to be good, but they need to go back to the way things were!!",

The staff is phenomenal. They do their best to make each guest happy. The food is excellent. This is better than any diner I have ever been at. Really, to compare it to any other restaurant you must go to a different category. I have never had any problem getting seated. I go here every week. I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I have entertained guests, hung out at the bar, wined and dined on date night here. The tacos, meatloaf, hash, burger, steak, salmon, and such are great. I go out to eat quite a bit, travel often, and prefer upper crust, home made, locally owned spots and look for them world wide. I am so happy this one is close to home. Thanks for the great food this year! I look forward to the next. Cheers!",

Then after they hook you, they pull a switch-a-roo. The menu suddenly changes and the prices increased. All this within a few months of opening as a new restaurant. The worst part about this is that many of their best items (which I assume were also very popular) changed dramatically and not in a good way. One example is a wonderful prosciutto salad which complimented fresh melon mixed in a bed of arugula. It is now a mixed green salad with prosciutto and strawberries. Since when does prosciutto go with strawberries? Even a \"simple\" customer such as myself knows what works best. Regardless, I tried it with the new combination and have decided to go back to Paradise Bakery down the street to get my salad fix. What a bummer! Oh, and this item suddenly increased in price from $9 to $11 after making it a cheaper way! Another item I miss- the grits. You can't find them anywhere and I was so happy to see them on the menu. Well, no longer folks! So save yourselves the money and grab breakfast/lunch where it doesn't hurt as much like the Egg and I less than a mile away. I'm truly bummed out because I was so excited to have a place like this around.",

My girlfriend and I went to lunch on Saturday just as the kitchen was being staffed for their dinner menu. We ordered off the happy hour menu, a pita pizza and 2 burgers. Apparently though, during the kitchen change, our burger order got lost. The pizza came out in about 10 minutes (prosciutto with goat cheese and veggies, pretty good), but our burgers took about 35 minutes more. Now I have had my food delayed before but at most they give a free beverage. BLDs staff went all out. They gave a complimentary beverage to start. The burgers arrived and were fantastic, the spicy one having a nice kick to it and the goat cheese one being very flavorful. On top of that, the chef come out and apologized with a parfait dessert. At the end of our meal, the manager picked up the tab as well.  I have waited longer for much lower quality in food and not had the great service as I did here. The food being great on top of that. I will definitely be bringing more people here for their happy hour menu.",

We went for dinner tonight.  Again, the food was OK but not worth the price tag.  I asked if we could get a small bowl of noodles with just some plain Parmesan cheese for my 1 year old and the server pointed us to the 6 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. Children's meals were 6 bucks and didn't include a drink - a 4-6 ounce cup of chocolate milk was an additional 2.75 which seems like a huge rip off.  I had to stop the bus boy twice from taking food that we weren't finished eating and then went to take my daughter to the bathroom, and he cleared off my water glass which I had JUST finally gotten refilled.  You'd think after the first time, he would have given us a bit more space/time but that was not the case.  My food and my husbands food pretty good but nothing worth the price tag. It's really a shame,  We've been to cork and I really, really wanted to like this place.",

I really appreciated the mix of the crowd...seems everyone is welcome. The food itself was familiar and unique at the same time. Kudos for that. The portions are larger, so when I read other reviews complaining about the price I say to them \"you get what you pay for\". Want cheap prices? Go to Micky D's I guess.  Why 4 stars and not 5? While the restaurant was good it wasn't perfect. The server forgot about my champagne despite the fact it was brunch time and never delivered it (also did nothing to accommodate the inconvenience). The barista station is confusing and I couldn't decide if I could order a latte there or not. After standing there for almost five minutes and being ignited I just left it. Also, the hostess is efficient but not very neighborly...she made me feel like just another customer; which I am but it's nice to feel more welcome at a local restaurant.",

But over five years or more it just can't seem to meet a standard or figure out what they actually are.   We went again last night after not going for about a year because we bought $30 for $15 on Living Social.  Decided that saving a little money it would be worth a try.  Very disappointed. Only reason for three stars was because our server was delightful.  As the ONLY server in the dining room, she was working as hard as she could to take care of the 8-10 tables she had by herself. There was a bartender and food runner which appeared to be the extent of front of house staff.  Bartender never walked from behind bar as he could have helped her clear plates, refill drinks, etc.   Loud Mexican music from the kitchen was competing with dining room music. Very annoying.   Wings were decent. Chicken picatta was dry, no light breading as a picatta typically would have.  The menu is overwhelming and not laid out very well but it's full of choices that are from too many different types of cuisine...from burger joint to steakhouse to bbq to Italian.   Figure out what one you want to be and do it well. We've been in for B, L, and D and have been disappointed every time.",

We had not gone to BLD in quite some time and are very happy we returned.  Kevin, our server/Manager, is outstanding!   The vegetable omelet and side of the turkey sausage was phenomenal.  The veggies were plentiful, and actually cooked to perfection.  The turkey sausage has a bit of a kick to it, and complimented the egg dish perfectly.  Coffee was amazing as well.  So happy we returned there and can't wait to go back and try all the other entrees for other meals as well.  Just a real nice place to go to.  EVERYONE was very friendly!!  You get a good feeling from the time you walk in until you leave.",

At times the dishes can be inconsistent but overall I think this is a really great brunch hangout. Also on Sunday they have $20 champagne bottles, not a bad deal. If you're going for the first time request not be seated in the back room, it's kind of cramped and doesn't capture the feel of the restaurant.  Recommendation: the goat cheese burger",

We had breakfast here, which was a mixed experience meal-wise.  I had the Hawaiian French toast ($8.75) which was disappointing to me.  The only thing that seemed to make it Hawaiian was a few slices of banana placed on top of the French toast.  The menu listed a molasses batter for the toast, but I couldn't taste much molasses flavor.  In addition, the toast itself looked overcooked and tasted dry.  For $8.75, I would have liked to see more ingredients than some slices of banana on top of 2 sliced pieces of battered toast (Maybe some pineapple? Or grilled ham?).  My husband had the biscuits and gravy platter (Around $10), which I thought was much better value wise and taste wise.  The gravy was rich and delicious, and it was a large amount of food since it came with bacon, potatoes, and 2 eggs.  I also tried the short rib benedict, which was nicely cooked, with great flavor.    So while I didn't really enjoy my dish, the others I tried were very good.  I'd like to go here again to try more dishes, but be aware of what entrees to get!",

So, 4 visits later, I feel I owe them another star.. they seemed to have picked up their game.  The dish I thought was not executed well (green chile pork tostada) was very well put together and so flavorful that I had to Yelp about it.  The other menu items I ventured to try were the scrambles.. specifically the shrimp-chorizo - AH! DELICIOSO!!  quickly became one of my favorite dishes!  See? I knew there was something special about this place.. they just needed to work out all the kinks.. and it seems like they did, I've noticed.  Also, the waiters have been good - prompt, accomodating, and informative.. that helps a lot.  So, thank you, thank you for making improvements.. you now can count me as a fan!",

    "text": "Date Attended: 11/13/14   Item Ordered: Goat Burger (white cheddar substituted for goat cheese) and Rocky Road Bread Pudding  Price : $20  Service: I have to confess this is my fourth time at BLD and I have always remembered to write a review after eating the entire meal. The staff is excellent, knowledgeable, and honest about the menu. Even had a chance to meet Brent, the restaurant manager, on one visit and he was a pretty cool guy. He even shared how many green concepts have been used to design the restaurant. Finally, it has always been spotless on every visit.  Atmosphere: It immediately reminded me of restaurants on the East Coast. The booth seating is plush, the patio is a nice getaway, and there is a real cool concrete sink outside both bathrooms. Even when it's busy, it doesn't seem loud.  Food Quality: The burger is PHENOMENAL! Definitely order it medium well. The tomatoes were roasted with garlic and it's like a gift falling on your plate when one falls out of the burger. An can you say \"Bacon Jam?\" Bacon on a burger is always good, but when it's spread on the bottom bun...you just might drift off into another world. The chocolate in the bread pudding was a bit overpowering, but the texture was perfect.   Overall Experience: Definitely going back again and again and again. Kind of ashamed that I didn't post a review for the breakfast items I had over the past month.  So here's my apology. The chorizo is smoking hot and the steak/eggs is simply amazing. I've never ever been a fan of toast, but the sourdough toast is ridiculous.. Yeah I just gave kudos for toast, but you'll understand after the first bite. The pancakes were kind of spongy and haven't ordered them again. Enjoy!",

    "text": "The absolute worst excuse for a restaurant breakfast my husband and I have ever been served.  THE WORST!  We went there at lunch time for breakfast because they tout that they serve it all day until close so we figured it would be cooked to order and fresh.  Boy were we wrong!  I ordered biscuits and gravy which came with 2 eggs, bacon and breakfast potatoes.  The 2 scrambled eggs were fine but that is where acceptable quality ends.  The two biscuits were undercooked and so soggy that they melded into one mushy piece or they sat for hours and got that way.  The breakfast potatoes were thick sliced fresh potatoes with no seasoning whatsoever (not even salt, pepper or butter) and had been deep fried to a crisp. Imagine the bland taste of a slice of baked potato with no seasoning, butter or anything on it?  They were so dark and overcooked that neither my husband nor I could even cut through many of them and he actually bounced a couple on the table which made a smacking sound so the waitress could really tell how overcooked they were.  She tld us \"Well, that's all they have put out right now.\" (whatever that meant).  They were also supposed to have onions in them per the menu and because my husband did not want the onions, I made sure she knew that I did want them.  Though I did not expect bland, seasonedless potatoes, the onions would have definitely added flavor.  But guess what?  Neither order had onions.  I sent mine back both for being overcooked and because I did want the onions.  The new order was not overcooked but was just as bland and seasonedless and again had no onions.  The waitress shrugged and said \"There's no onions again and I don't know why\" and just walked away.  We could not believe that she accepted them a second time from the cook without the onions.  Then there was the bacon.  It was almost black it was so overcooked and was so dry that when you picked it up, it crumbled.  Three or four pieces were curled and stuck together.  You could not break them apart.  When we later spoke to the Manager, she said they bake it all in the over ever day at 7 a.m.  Then they apparently throw it in the deep fryer to warm it up when someone orders.  (They also deep fry the potatoes).  Thus we were served six hour old overcooked bacon at 1 p.m.  Pretty disgusting.  It appears that they hold all the food they do not sell at breakfast to support their claim to all day breakfast.  One can only speculate about whether they are meeting health department standards for the temperature they hold the food at.    My husband could not eat hardly anything on his plate and the manager noted that even his scrambled eggs were overcooked.  The burnt bacon he tried to eat resulted in terrible heartburn.  The young bartender-manager eventually did the right thing but initially was very condescending and patronizing.  She refused to accept our description of the bacon as overcooked or burnt and kept interrupting us (we were very courteous) to correct us by calling it \"extra-crispy\" and actually rolled her eyes two or three times over our comments which were relayed quietly and very respectfully and constructively.  She said she wished she had known about the issues as she perhaps could have done something such as substituting something better to our liking.  When we told her that we DID ask the waitress to let the Manager know she brushed it under the table by saying \"Oh, well maybe she was too busy\" (the restaurant only hand a handful of diners in it at that time).  Her attitude remained condescending and non-apologetic until I asked her about the owners then everything changed.  She comped our meal (which we had not asked for), gave us a $15 coupon to \"try them again\", and gave us a business card with the General Manager's name and email address that she added to it.  Thus in the end she did more than enough for us but it was a long road getting there.  I see some good comments here on Yelp so perhaps this was an aberration but I don't relish the thought of trying them again even to use the $15 coupon knowing that what is served to us may not be freshly cooked.  Any chef that would put what we got on our plates in our view is not to be trusted.  We used to dine there a few years ago for lunch or dinner under the previous owners and the food was fine.  It is a clean and pleasant atmosphere but we don't like to look forward to a meal only to be disappointed.  If they have a practice of holding food for hours, it is in our opinion to risky to go back both so that we are not disappointed and because of possible health risks.  Check out the two photos I posted here and see for yourself.  Ask yourself if you would confidence in a chef that served you that bacon!",

I had one of the Mexican breakfast dishes; the downside with it was there was way to much green sauce. The server removed that from our bill so that was great.    We returned a second time to see if that was just an off day.  The second time I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and it was okay, but again I've definitely had better.  It seems like with all their dishes they have tweaked them just a little to be unique, but for us it came off as just undesirable.",

My coworkers are constantly raving about their food, but I just never found the time to head over in this direction.  Fortunately I had a friend flying out of the Mesa Gateway Airport and figured it would be the perfect time to check this place out! We got there fairly early on a Sunday morning, around 10:30am and we were lucky to get seated right away.  They have TV's throughout the restaurant, which is good for all those Sunday football fans.   I ended up getting the Hawaiian style French Toast - captain crunch style, and my friend got the BLD Benedict.  Both were amazing!  I tried my friends benedict and I enjoyed how it wasn't a thick slab of ham like other places serve.  It was thin sliced pieces which made cutting so much easier!   And their french toast was amazing!  It was sweet enough with the captain crunch, bananas, and powdered sugar that I didn't even need syrup.  Although I still ended up using a very small amount just so that it didnt' feel like I was eating dry bread.  I will definitely be making it out here again sometime soon!  Hopefully to try out their lunch/dinner menu!",

Like the overall vibe BLD has. Our server was Tara, and she was super! Always making sure our table had everything we needed and seeing how we were doing. Love good service!    I picked BLD because I heard they had eggs benedicts and I have been craving hollandaise sauce forever! I ordered the Cali Benedicts, came with bacon, tomato & avocado, poached eggs on top of a English muffin covered in hollandaise sauce with a side of breakfast potatoes. The plate looked beautiful, bright yellows, greens and reds; I like color so this pleased my eyes. The only thing that was a bummer was it was lacking in flavor, everything was bland, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but no tangy taste too it, and that's the part I had been craving.  So I wasn't blown away with the flavor of the food, but I was happy with checking out BLD.",

I usually show dissatisfaction through never going back. However, the manager's inability to do their basic job makes me feel like I need to spread the word. We went Memorial Day, it was busy, but expected. Coming in we had eaten there last year and it was awesome, so when we were told it was a 20 min wait... we thought it would be worth it.  During that time I overheard 2 people getting checks \"adjusted\" and I thought \"hmmm cost of a busy day.\"  We were seated in only 5 min so I brushed it off and thought \"home run\".  Service was typical busy restaurant, slow but friendly. We waited 45 minutes for biscuits and gravy and a eggs Benedict, which came out cold. After 2 bites, we asked for the check and we told her the food was cold/gross.  Waitress apologized and offered to adjust the check. I thought that was fair and it was my mistake for coming on a day in which they were overwhelmed. The check came back with 5 dollars off a 30 dollar tab... And she acted like that was fair and left. I was sooo pissed I paid, left no tip and left as quickly as possible because I did not want to embarrass my girlfriend.  In the car, she asked why I didn't ask for a manager and proceeded to call.  She got a hold of the manager who claimed she would get me a refund and call back... no refund, no call back.  Never going back.",

    "text": "I received a giftcard for BLD and immediately looked up the menu. True to their name, they do breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The menu has a wide variety of items that all sound really good. However, I've only been here twice and both times for breakfast. For my first visit, I used the drive-thru. The drive-thru allows you to order drinks or call ahead and pick-up your meal. I was unaware of the call ahead portion, so I just ordered their signature iced coffee and was on my way.   On my second visit, I brought my husband and his sister for breakfast. The place was extremely busy inside, so instead of waiting 15+ minutes as the hostess advised, we asked if we could sit outside. We were seated immediately and our waitress was quick to come over for drink orders. I ordered a hot vanilla latte and my sister-in-law asked for an iced caramel macchiato. The waitress was quick to quip that BLD's macchiatos were nothing like Starbucks. My sister-in-law assured the waitress that was fine. Shortly after, the waitress came back with an iced drink and an apology that she doesn't know how to make a macchiato and was waiting for the barista. Confused, we all thought the drink she brought might be the macchiato but it turned out to be my drink. Somehow my hot latte became an iced latte. Seeing the waitress was already frazzled, I didn't say anything. It still tasted good. Finally, 10 minutes later, my sister-in-law's drink arrived. It was basically a latte with tons of caramel sauce. My sister-in-law said it tasted bitter since the caramel wasn't mixed in well but she liked it nonetheless. For breakfast, I ordered the chicken and waffles, my husband ordered short rib eggs benedict, and his sister ordered the chicken fried steak with no cheese on the potatoes. My fried chicken was a little dry but the waffle was delicious drench in syrup. (We had to grab syrup from another table - the waitress never brought any nor did she offer it.) My husband enjoyed his short rib eggs benedict - no real complaints. My sister-in-law liked her chicken fried steak, but the potatoes came with cheese despite her asking for no cheese. Near the end of the meal, the waitress finally checked in on us and our food. We asked for to-go boxes and the check. Another 10 minutes roll by as our waitress stops by her other table and finally gets back to us. We paid using my gift card and cash.   On the drive home, my sister-in-law commented that she would never go back and I agreed. The food was decent, but the waitress was really inattentive and messed up several items we ordered. To be honest, the waitress acted like we weren't worth the time and left us feeling neglected. Maybe it was an off day, but after seeing how the waitress treated her other table much better, it definitely felt deliberate. Additionally, the restaurant is more than 30 minutes away from where we live and definitely not worth the drive.",

After an additional 20 min of wondering where the food was, I looked around and saw that none of the tables had been served...35+ min and tables were bare. When the food did come out, it was fantastic! I had the goat burger and let me tell you, the angle of my pic doesn't do this thing justice. This burger is HUGE! I hurt myself just trying to finish this meal. My mouth says more and my gut screams, STOP!! So yummy!!",

The service is good however the food has really slipped and gotten to the point where it's horrible for breakfast. This used to be a weekly breakfast spot for us. I am very disappointed because it is a cute restaurant and close to home but we gave it a few chances and it didn't redeem itself also it's a little bit pricey especially for breakfast.",

I wish I would have taken a picture of the sloppy thrown together burger so you could see what I'm talking about. The meat was super thin and over cooked. It was all bread and shredded lettuce. The so called caramelized onions were not caramelized and the shredded lettuce was old. Awesome bloody Mary though. I would have stayed to drink another bloody Mary but it didn't seem worth my time. I was so over the experience because of the service and poorly made food.",

A group of 8 teenage girls came and sat in the booth next to me. They were so loud and laughing and just being unconcerned with other diners that I left. When I called the manager to express how unpleasant the girls made not only my dinner but others around me, he replied \"I apologize. There's nothing we can do. It's like if there's a crying baby we can't do anything.\" A crying baby is very different than 8 rude teenage girls. Perhaps he could have said \"hey would you girls like to sit on our patio so you can giggle all you like?\" Or how about saying to me \"I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your dining experience, the next time you visit how about a desert on me?\" Instead I won't return to a place that is pricy and cares nothing about the comfort of their  So my second review..went back because this is one of my fav places! So very yummy. Taco night..great deal..yummy food and beautiful presentation. Hh is awesome and my server was attentive w/o being intrusive, helpful and friendly! No teenagers making dinner uncomfortable! Beautiful place, great service, warm/beautifully presented food!",

I've tried a few different menu items, but the chicken and waffles has to be my favorite! The breading on the chicken fingers is perfect! Also will go great with your Bloody Mary!

I've been here two other times and always remembered the interesting and appetizing menu.   It was a quiet Saturday morning, just after 11a and when we visited this time we walked in and the hostess didn't greet us. We stood at the front for about a minute right in front of her before she said she'd be right with us. We weren't in a rush and that was fine however we asked to sit at the bar instead.   The vibe is modern, clean and very welcoming even if the staff was a little less enthused. At the bar I ordered a Bloody Mary and the bartender asked my preference of spice and if I would like some bacon. When I got my drink a new bartender took over and took our orders.    We ordered the chicken and brie on sour dough and the bbq brisket special. Although the food was good, the side dishes were wrong and that was the last time we were approached. We had to ask for water, napkins, utensils and the side of bacon that never came. When asked about the bacon the bartender said, \"Sorry, do you still want it?\"  In the end, I'm sad that the food was good but the experience wasn't. We would have stayed longer and ordered more drinks but it didn't seem like we were worth their time. I hope they improve because I think this place is great with a unique menu.",

Yesterday was just an all time low for us, We love the fish tacos and we've had it prepared two different ways with some different ingredients as well. Yes it's not a big deal but when you're expecting yummy tacos and you're expecting it to be a certain way it frustrating,   Also With our taco orders, the tortilla were so cold it was like they just came out the fridge and they popped them right into the takeout boxes. And the chicken tacos were not even assembled like tacos all the ingredients just in a big mixed pile and three tortilla sitting on the bottom!",

Food will be old, cold and not as tasty, hot or fresh as it is on a busy Saturday or Sunday morning.",

I appreciate that the cooks can poach an egg correctly, and make a proper over-medium egg.  Why where they covered in salt and pepper?  The biscuits and gravy were almost inedible due to having too much salt.  The breakfast potatoes had visible gains of kosher salt covering them. I ordered a bloody mary, which is unusual for a Monday, I know, but it took 25 minutes and the server said they dont have a bartender in the morning during the week.  Well, there were at least 5-6 servers standing around talking, I think it took all of them to make the drink. We've had a similar overly salted meal at dinner a couple of weeks ago. We want to like BLD but wont be back any time soon.",

The breakfasts I've had there are great, specifically the pancakes and the eggs benedict. Both were delicious and filling. I've had dinner there too, which was called the \"pound and a half burrito\" which consisted of eggs, potatoes, avocado, and shredded ribs. It was delicious and I was very pleased. My parents both enjoyed it as well, and have stated their want to come back soon!  The look of the establishment is very modern, and they have a wonderful patio and bar that I have yet to sit at. Im hoping to do so very soon.  The waiters and waitresses are very pleasant and know what they are talking about.  I  look forward to my visits to BLD, whenever they are planned! I would recommend this to anyone who is in the area, and even anyone who doesn't mind driving a bit farther for a great meal.  I hope that this restaurant stays this way, as I would hate to have it change management or owners and go downhill. One of my new favorites!",

The Hog was good, although I was searching for the cheese, the Breakfast Burrito however was a different story. My wife isn't a fan of onions and this was onion overkill. It totally overpowered everything else in the burrito and she could not eat anymore. Now to lunch. We thought/hopes it would be different since it had been months since breakfast (breakfast was around Thanksgiving), however one of us left hungry again. This time it was me. I had the Steak Tacos and she had a Chicken Sandwich. My tacos were incredibly overspiced that I couldn't enjoy them, although I tried eating 2 of the 3. My mouth was on fire and so was her's after a small cut of the steak. We got a check back a minute after the food was dropped but I hadn't eaten much at that point. The next time the waiter stopped back, which was about mid way thru our meal, he dropped the check off and said I'll take this for you when you're ready. I didn't know I was finished with my meal! We were disappointed for B and L, I don't think we'll be going back for D.",

The bar is fun to grab a drink at during games or on a weekend night.  We love the servers, bartenders, and managers.  Great place.  When they get super busy it can be a little slower but nothing major and frankly no restaurant is perfect.  Since the other places have opened in the strip mall the whole area has really picked up, which is nice to see.  The Cali Benedict, shrimp and chorizo hash, and the Florentine are excellent.  The eggs and sausage with a biscuit are very good.  Love the biscuits!  The coffee drinks are always tasty, love the Americano and Soy Latte.  They also have many coffee drinks that aren't on the menu so ask or tell them what you want.  For lunch, the goat burger is really good.  As far as dinner, the short rib pasta and the short rib dinner are very good.  Really a nice addition to the local east valley breakfast, and overall restaurant, scene.  This place is one of our staples.",

We will definitely return. My only complaint is that my cranberry juice was served warm. I requested a glass of ice and to my surprise received another glass of juice with ice and an apology. I ended up with two glasses of juice which was not bad considering they are small. Overall, enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service.",

Got home and opened up our packages to a huge disappointment.  I ordered the South of the Border omelette and couldn't believe that the fruit and sour cream were both thrown on top of the omelette.  The fruit should have been packaged separately (hot and cold don't belong together) and the sour cream should have been in a cup by itself.  The pepper jack cheese in the omelette was of the processed variety (think Velveeta.)  I would think that a place that tries to be higher end would use quality ingredients.  The second order was fried chicken and waffles but that's all we got.  No butter, no syrup.  So instead of eating our meals we had to make a trip to the grocery store to buy syrup since the restaurant was too far away.  When I called the restaurant to point this out I was told (after a very long and awkward pause) that the chicken and waffles would be taken off the bill.",

I ordered the Chef's Burger from their lunch menu. Grass-fed, ground in-house 8 oz burger with arugula, Gruyere, and onion rings.  I personally would have liked the arugula melted under the Gruyere or tossed with the Russian dressing.  It was too ordinary undressed on the top bun. But, it IS the Chef's Burger and if that's how he likes it, then that's the way it should be enjoyed. Oh, and the onion rings are awesome.    The service was genuine and friendly. The food came out reasonably fast and HOT!  It would have been nice if you could hear the music...it was just too quite.  I will definitely come back and try other menu options and I highly recommend BLD!!",

Well the chicken was like med rare beef, pink and oozing pink juice. Not good. Sent back to kitchen and came back, kinda medium, still pink near the bone. Sent back again and manager came out and said what can we do, so I ordered the tuna which was good. Wife's short rib was not what I am used to for short ribs. No falling off the bone here. Just chunks of beef that was kinda dry and overcooked. Like brisket really.   So not to good a first experience. As I tell everyone, if you want good chicken, check out Banderra in Scottsdale. They set the standard for all chicken in the valley. Sooo good.",

Ive only been for breakfast. however comma the lunch menu looks epic and anyone who can make a person who hates breakfast fall in love with breakfast all over again deserves props for the whole menu. i will update my review for lunch someday...problem is, I'm not allowed to go to the same place more than once a day and i come here for breakfast. so, hence the problem. Also, since my Delorian is broken (Popsicle gas sucks), i can not currently go backwards ( IE: delete button broken, ramble shall continue on). Well, any great breakfast joint will have 2 things IMO; fresh, home made Mimosa's and NFL on the TV. check and check. parking? a cinch. easier than a valet. Greeting? always warm and inviting. Cool bar seating/normal seating? you guessed it folks, the price is right. Food? O....M.....G...... my goal is simple: try the entire menu. the problem? I'm stuck on item #3, on my 19th visit. do that math. Luckily for me, my girlfriend has amazing will power and is on item 14 and is a small eater. guess who gets her dish? This Guy!!! i haven't had one bad thing. My favorite is BY FAR the Chili Pork Tostada. The braised short rib egg Benedict is so good, you'll literally O Face at the table. no joke. for you followers of me, you know how i feel about places that make your wet dream a reality. seriously. incredible food. also, 2 other awesome things; the patio is legally allowed to have dog's on it and they have a dog menu! how cool is that? answer: freaking cool man! also the bathrooms are so weird and unexpected...its like the Blue Man Group, i could try to explain it to you but it just wont make sense. you have to witness it for yourself. PLUS - if you want healthy, they have egg whites, turkey, spinach omelet. AND a drive thru for phone ahead orders AND AND protein shakes also. whats that now, like 8 PS's? told ya, backspace button has been deleted.",

Waffles used to be a decent size with bits of bacon baked in.  Now, the waffles are round, the diameter of a tennis ball.  Really?  Why even bother.  No bacon bits and service is very \"mechanical\", not much personality.  So we'll have to scratch this one off the list",

We sat in Diane's section, ordered brisket platter, BLT with avocado, and mini burger.  Thursday is $5.00 off BBQ and burgers. Food was good, and sweet potato fries were good. Food came out hot and fast. We arrived right after the lunch rush.  BLD has an inside community table, dog friendly patio, and the bar opens on the patio side so you can sit at the bar outside with your dog (how cool is that).  Great customer service, everyone is friendly and Luis, as the Host is always checking up on everyone to make sure everyone is \"good\". I actually thought he was the manager he was so good.  We plan to return for breakfast soon.",

I'll get to it quick- I just didn't love my food. I wanted to sooo badly. I got the huevos rancheros because I typically love it at other places. It was basically a very over flavored quesadilla filled with mashed black beans and a lot of pepper jack cheese. It had a small spoonful of salsa on top and 2 fried eggs. Personally I think there was too much going on and it was too heavy. The salsa made the tortilla soggy too. I only made it through half and didn't keep the leftovers. I am a leftovers gal so that should tell you a lot!   I might give it another shot someday but for now...no thanks.",

It was very flavorful. The combination of cabbage and black beans with the tequila pork was tantalizing.   It was too hot but the patio outside is gorgeous and dog friendly.    The breakfast menu looks amazing!!!  They have appetizers for breakfast!!!!!!  How cool!!!!  There is also a drive thru. When I read that is scared me a bit. Don't be fooled.

I don't really dig crowds because that usually means there's the potential for loud talkers, drunken sluts, and unsupervised crumbsnatchers.  I'll take peace and quiet where I can get it.  Anyway!  I had the Green Chili Pork Tostada which was a beautiful and flavorful dish.  I should have taken a picture of it, but I'm still Yelp-shy when it comes to taking pics in front of the staff.  Beautifully presented, the pork was tender and plentiful, and I really enjoyed the black bean puree which smoothed out the spicy pico de gallo.  I have mentioned before that I'm a heat pansy, and this dish was good, but a little spicy for me.  Overall I think the flavors blended very nicely.  I brought home half of it and I think the leftovers will make some very nice breakfast burritos tomorrow morning.  Mr. M had the biscuits and gravy, bacon, breakfast potatoes, and eggs sunny side up.  His meal was cooked perfectly as well, and I really like it when onions are fried up with the taters.  I was sticking my fork into his plate more than once, and used one of those potatoes to soak up some of the flavorful broth on my plate.  Delicious!  I enjoyed the B & G, but he said he didn't care for the gravy very much, that there was something sweet about it that he didn't expect that reminded him of hollandaise sauce.  Maybe they got their whisks mixed up.  I dunno, but I liked it.  We watched the chicken & waffles and the meatloaf hash get walked by our booth and I'm looking forward to a return visit to give them a try.    Our server was friendly and fast with refills and the atmosphere was nice.  I like the calming grey color scheme.  The coffee was nothing special to me, but not bad.  Next time I would try one of their specialty coffee drinks.",

I got a breakfast burrito and a pancake, and I cannot even express how much I loved it. I couldn't even finish the burrito because it was so big. Pancakes are an essential part of breakfast. And the pancakes here are definitely up to par.  Our waiter was pretty nice, he always came to check on us and refill our drinks.    The atmosphere in this restaurant is great. Everyone seems to be having a good time, enjoying their food, no complaints.   The rest of the people I went with also liked their food. I tried some of my uncles breakfast potatoes with cheese on them and they were sooo good.   This place generates enough business itself without all of the good Yelp reviews. It's definitely worth stopping in. The next time I come to Arizona, I will be coming back for sure.   How soon can they start building a BLD down the street from my house?",

The inside doesn't disappoint either. The bar is set right next to a large out door area and gives off a very cool vibe. The chalk boards everywhere are a nice touch and the wine closet is cool to look at. The staff seem to be happy to work there and super friendly and helpful. The restaurant is also well kept up and very clean. So why three stars??? The food, it was just so average. I really expected to be wowed walking in there and I just was not. I had chicken and waffles it was served with bacon and scrambled eggs. The eggs were over done and not salted at all, the chicken was properly breaded in some areas but not in others. It also could really be brought to life with some seasoning. It however was not dried out. The bacon was good. The waffles were cute but not yummy, they were a bit chewy and had no crisp at all. They were labeled as malt waffles but that flavor did not come across- if the syrup was flavored and served warm that would be a huge kick up for this dish. The portion was generous and you would not leave the table hungry. I see a ton of potential for this place - and if I ever hear that they revamp the menu and really go for flavor I would test them out again. I hope they do!!!",

I paid $1 extra to get a biscuit instead of toast and that's when it went downhill.  First it was served with no butter.  Second it was huge but that meant it wasn't cooked enough inside.  Third it crumbled when I tried to butter it.  Maybe a great biscuit to go with gravy but definitely not a biscuit to serve instead of toast.  Plus the price was high on a basic breakfast.",

The food wasn't too bad .  The restaurant is clean .  We'll be back for breakfast one day . The bright spot of the night was the bartender that said 'good night ! ' on the way out .",

The atmosphere is perfect - very nice, clean and unique. I feel like I could sneak in there for breakfast in yoga pants or come a bit dressed up for date night with my husband and never feel out of place. I keep meaning to come here to hang out at the bar for a happy hour or girl's night as well!  I have made a point to try a lot of things on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Their wine list is good, coffee is excellent and the portions are generous.  I think it is very difficult to successfully combine, in one restaurant, all three meals, a bar, a dog-friendly patio, a date place, a family place, etc. - and BLD seems to do that seamlessly! I can't think of an occasion that this restaurant wouldn't be a good choice.  If it tells you anything, I can rarely get my husband excited to go sit down somewhere for dinner - but he will often proactively suggest we go to BLD!",

We could here him say to the cooks, can you make a new order of chorizo fries without stale fries. The new order came and they were hot and steamy, but you always second guess yourself after sending your food back. We ordered our entree which was good, a grill cheese and salad. We had left over salad that we asked for a togo box and extra dressing in which they charged us .50. I couldn't believe that. Although this is my third time here and I've had much better service during the previous visits, it will be my last. As we exited, the waitress at the bar greeted us goodbye",

We got there pretty early so we had no problems with the service like some of the other reviews.  I got the caprese salad which was ok, I've had better, but the toasted bread was not even worth the extra $1. My husband ordered the special which was a seared yellowtail. It was super dry but they remade it for him and he said that one was really good, and it wasn't skimpy at all. It seemed like their prices were a little high for their other entrees but I can't say if they are worth it or not. My salad was about $8.50 and the yellowtail special was $18.

Because of the great happy hour, it seemed like a good place to have a get together with friends for a birthday.  When I inquired about reserving for up to 20 people no one there seemed to know how to handle the request.  I was finally given the business card of a manager and asked to email him.  I did that night.  The reply was a week later and I was told there was a $750 min food and beverage charge not including tip.  I responded that I was disappointed and never heard from him again.  Does BLD not want business???  I booked the gathering at the Tortilla Factory with no issues, no minimums, and with prompt and friendly service - just the standard 18% gratuity which is expected.  I can't bring myself to go back to BLD.  Their wait staff is awesome but the management is horrible.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that I know many people who LOVE this place and frequent it on a regular basis.  Also, I have worked in a restaurant for the majority of my life (serving, bartending, managing...) so what I am about to say is no exaggeration.  That being said, why does it seem that every time I go there I feel like I walk in with a giant stamp on my forehead reading \"PLEASE IGNORE ME AND GIVE ME TERRIBLE SERVICE\"?????????    Every time it takes about 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10-15 to get our drinks (even while sitting at the bar)!   Last time my fiance and I bellied up to the bar the bartender didn't even make contact with us for 15 minutes because he was too busy bragging about that he is the \"best bartender in the world\"- I kid you not!  It was obvious that there were several regulars at the bar, but a bartender needs to know how to schmooze them and pour drinks for others at the same time.  I honestly don't think that guy could walk and chew gum at the same time :-/  Next, when we have actually hung around long enough to get food, it hasn't been that great.  The pancakes tasted like they are the frozen kind you pop in the microwave, the carne asada and eggs dish was sooooooooo greasy we ate about 2 bites, and the bruschetta was bland and the bread tasted like it has fake smoke seasoning on it- which needless to say was totally weird!    I feel like my family and I have just had bad experiences at BLD and as mentioned above, many people I know love this place!  Having drafts like Papago Orange Blossom will ensure I try this place again sometime- perhaps we will sit in the dining room since the patio and bar have been a bust so far!  PLEASE BLD- I WANT TO LIKE YOU!!!!!  PRO'S- Protein shakes, dog friendly patio, and great craft beer!   CON'S- Service, food (so far).....",

    "text": "We just tried this place again this weekend, because I really want to like it. The menu is so enticing. However, this was our 3rd time there, and it's been a huge disappointment every time. The inside of the place looks very modern, and the food sounds amazing from the description. However, once you actually taste it, it's hard to believe how disappointing it tastes and how much you just paid. I have been there with my family every time, so I have sampled quite a few dishes. Every single one was a big let down. It's not inedible, but not very good, especially for the price.  The service has been poor each time, and we had a different server each time, all bad. Each time they have forgotten requests, 2/3 times had to come back to ask what someone ordered, and they are generally inattentive.  With regard to kids, their kids meals are ridiculous. My daughter got a plate with 3 pancakes nothing else, no meat, fruit or veg. for $6; they weren't even good pancakes. The last time we were there we asked for some fruit for my youngest. We wanted a side order of mixed fruit, and we were asked which fruits we would like. We gave a few that he might like and expected one small bowl of fruit. My 9 month old received each fruit individually in an adult size bowl nearly full, and we were charged individually. An adult couldn't have eaten all the fruit he was given, and the bananas were beyond the point I would have served them.",

We expected slow service on this visit because it was a Holiday weekend.  After waiting over an hour for our food, we asked to speak to the manager who told us that this should be expected because of the Holiday and offered no apology.  He went back to the kitchen and advised us that our food would be out in five minutes. After waiting another 10 to 15 minutes, the food finally came out one meal short. We were offered no apology or discount for the forgotten meal and slow service. Nothing on our ticket was comped. I was super bummed and wanted to like this place, but for \"OK\" food and bad service, it is not worth it.",

I am sad that some of my favorite things disappeared, but there are still a lot of amazing choices.  Thick cut bacon - this is really more of a bacon-steak than any thick cut bacon I have had elsewhere.  You have to try it!  Mimosas - on Sundays, bottles of champagne are $10.  Order a bottle and a glass of oj and mix your own :)  Sangarita - they have a not so amazing margarita on tap...mix it with the red sangria though and it is great.  Prosciutto and fried goat cheese salad - This is so good, I have started making my own copy cat version to take to work for lunch everyday (minus the fried part.)  Since I am usually dining alone, I almost always sit at the bar.  The bartenders and servers are friendly and fun to talk to.  The owner and managers greet me by name (ok, maybe I come here a bit too often.)  I would give it 5 stars, but I don't like any of the food choices on the happy hour menu.

    "text": "In a word: underwhelming. I'm saddened and frustrated, really. BLD is a cool place with a fantastic pedigree that I want so badly to like, but it just won't let me.  Today's breakfast was my second visit. The first was for lunch shortly after opening. It was an unmitigated disaster. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at that time, but can't avoid Yelping at this point.  Had the short ribs Benedict. Although the eggs were poached nearly perfectly, they were covered in a bland red wine Hollandaise that looked like melted Silly Putty and lacked the citrusy brightness that a good Holalndaise should have. The short ribs were pot-roasty, rather than the velvety melt-in-your mouth delight that you'd expect. Overall, the dish was under-seasoned and wan, but you couldn't complain that the short ribs were too rich.  The side of potatoes and onions was good with the exception of the fact that the onions were inconsistently cooked; some were crunchy while others were soft and beginning to brown. I'd prefer better browning and a nice crust, but seasoning was spot-on here at least.  My wife had the Spaniard scramble, which arrived looking more like an omelette gone bad than a scramble. The linguica provided the only seasoning; sadly it was underrepresented and the rest of the dish needed salt.  My latte was great, and at a $0.50 premium over brewed coffee, can't be beat.  On both visits, the staff has been a disappointment. Today's server was clearly trained NOT to ask how things were. Either that, or she was oblivious. She didn't return to check in once during our meal and delivered our check silently. The hostess was cute but clueless. I forgot my morning paper in the car, and when I went outside to get it, she welcomed me for a second time when I returned. She did an admirable job of pretending she remembered I'd already been seated in the half-empty restaurant when I told her I had a table, at any rate.  As a big fan of Cork, BLD has been a tremendous disappointment on two visits. While I'd like to be a regular at one of the spacious booths every weekend, I guess I'll have to settle for a trip to Cork every few months instead.",

Just tried the $3 house merlot at happy hour and so far I'm a believer. Waiting for the food now. Be right back.    Ok. Tomato bacon soup and grilled cheese worth the $5 price tag. Beware: the tomato soup is spicy! SIZZLE!  The steak quesadilla in a green tortilla could have used less cheese but the steak was tender and reminded me of Korean BBQ. Yummy for $7.  Finally, we had the pita pizza which was a meal in itself. Tons of arugula with nicely melted goat cheese and a fair amount of prosciutto made this OK for a $7 pick.   The place has a great decor but I can see where it is hit or miss. I was fortunate to have a great wait staff on both occasions but then again the restuarant was empty. The vibe is wonderful but they have to have consistency in service or food for it to survive.  I wish them luck - I personally would like to see a place like this survive.",

However, the past two times were just plain bad. First they mess with the menu too much, they don't seem to be able to handle peek times anymore and they mess up the food orders. This last time we had to send the food back twice and we saw two tables get up and leave they were so irritated. We have crossed this off and will not be back.",

I ordered the seared tuna and a beet salad, and the tuna was just.. eek. I understand \"pepper crusted\" is right there on the menu, but it felt like eating a tablespoon of black pepper! The salad was okay, but the beets were undercooked, and the dressing was kinda bland. The service was good, and my partner enjoyed his meal, but for me I'm not sure I'd come back again.",

Service - Our server was particularly friendly and my coffee never went empty.  Food - If a breakfast place has chicken fried steak, I usually get it. I'm glad I got it here as it is the real deal. Not some over processed frozen brick, but actual cube steak done up right. Comes with side of eggs and potatoes.  Price - You pay a bit for atmosphere, which speaking of, this place does have a \"cool\" vibe.  I would definitely recommend you trying this place out. I think it would be tough to be disappointed. I'd like to try happy hour next as their food prices look amazing.",

A few Chandler workers were having lunch but the place was not full by any means. The side potatoes were very good. But, the Monte Cristo had a funny flavor that both my wife and I picked up on. It was ok... but not something I would go back for. Something just tasted strange. It seemed overpriced too. We had two Monte Cristos and one iced tea. After the tip it was over $30. Too much for a couple sandwiches for lunch. I don't think we will go back..",

I really feel that they are competitive for one of the best eggs benidicts in the valley. the classic ham eggs and hollandaise. They do offer other versions, however I am a purist in this sense and they nail it. Another big draw for me is the barista. Their lattes and Iced dirty chai drinks are my favorite. I feel like they are at a high level of quality. They make a great spicy bloody mary as well. BLD has a good happy hour with several apps and drinks on special. I used to think they were trying to go to big with lunch and dinner in the past and it was a bit of a turnoff for me, but I have recently tried them again for lunch and I was impressed. It looked like their menu had been simplified a bit and I really enjoyed it. Pro Tip - if you go for breakfast on the weekend go early! there are a few big churches nearby and it can quickly fill up. Also if you are in a hurry in the AM they have a drive through for the barista. I even think they accept call in orders to be picked up at the window.",

The salsa that came with it was fresh and had a good flavor. Staff was friendly. I sat on the patio and there were some people out there with their dogs; not something that I appreciate.",

    "text": "My sister had brought me home some food from BLD last week. It was a deep fried cauliflower and chorizo fries. These are appetizers on the menu, but the serving size is humongous! But that's a good thing because it's plenty of bang for your buck and it tastes amazing. Like the name of the place clearly states, they serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day. So I decided I would come try out the food for myself. The one bad thing about that is they have about 6 menus with a lot of food items on there, which makes it really hard to make a decision.  They had a special for a bottle of champagne for mimosas for only $18, so I got that with my sister. I also got the turkey croissant sandwich with sweet potato fries. If you read my reviews you know I love blue cheese dressing and or Ranch dressing for my fries. My server told me they didn't have classic blue cheese dressing but they had a red wine blue cheese dressing. I said oh that's nice let me try it please. It ended up being more of a vinaigrette... Pretty watery and highly \"vinegar-y.\" It's clearly more of a salad dressing that a dipping sauce. Luckily for me they had ranch dressing so I was able to enjoy my fries the way I like them. The sandwich was pretty good, but I have had many like it before.  We went there on a Sunday at about 1PM and it was busy, but no wait times. There were a few large parties and plenty of smaller groups dining. The restaurant space is a good size, so it did not feel crowded. Overall it was an OK experience.",

She understood we did not like our food and attempted to accommodate anyway she could. Maybe try lunch or dinner here but surely not a breakfast place to eat!",

    "text": "This morning my wife and daughter ended up here by accident. What a pleasant surprise.  We were seated right away and the place was packed.. Smelled really good too. Kevin Falcone was our server and he was awesome. The menu was rather large and a lot to look at so, as I usually do at a place I've never been to, I asked for his recommendation and it didn't disappoint. I got the craziest spicy bloody Mary with bacon and all kinds of stuff in it. It was delicious.  I said I could do with something hearty like maybe a burger? Well... This thing was not only a monster, but super tasty and holy moly... If you like to just blast your taste buds (and have a strong heart) get a side of the hickory smoked garlic butter. I dipped my burger and sweet potato fries in it, cause.. garlic butter. It makes anything better lol.  So, anyways... Can't wait to go back and try something else. To sum up... Great food, comfortable and casual atmosphere, Kevin. I'll be back.",

Each time we've had Bill as our Bartender/Server, each time he has done an awesome job. He is completely in touch with the bar and patrons dining at the bar and never leaves you hanging waiting for drinks, food or answers to questions. The food has been amazing each time (today I had the corned beef hash which was awesome) and we always leave glad we came. The unfortunate thing is we're moving to the Cave Creek area and now our drive will be much longer to get there. We wished we had visited sooner. Great environment, positive energy.",

    "text": "Brunch: Making morning binge drinking seem classy since forever.  I woke up this morning, checked my texts, and suddenly I'm at brunch with the guys and a boy [the cutest 4-month old baby boy at that!].  Everybody ordered their food, some bussers knocked over a huge trashcan, and suddenly champagne bottles were rolling across the floor.  Surprisingly, the baby doesn't cry.  Phew.  Our hostess was pretty unfriendly but the waitress was a peach!  I had ordered The Cali Eggs Benedict [bacon, grilled tomato, avocado, topped with hollandaise, and includes breakfast potatoes.  $12.25] and it was alright.  The hollandaise was creamy and smooth but lacking that lemon juice tangy tartness.  Still though, those eggs were poached beautifully.  The bacon was also pretty fantabulous and cooked perfectly.  As for a random wedge of avocado on the side, it kind of felt like they forgot to put the avocados on top and just stuck it there.  Oh well.  The bites I had of the House Made Biscuits and Sausage Gravy [two eggs, apple wood smoked bacon with breakfast potatoes.  $12.75] were super flavorful.  You can tastes the fat in that sausage gravy.  I can see myself gaining 5lbs just eating that.  Oh man.  As for breakfast potatoes, there's not much you can say about them.  They're crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and needed some ketchup love.  Overall, I had a decent brunch with great company.  Perhaps with all my attention on making faces at the baby, my meal wasn't too note-worthy.  I wouldn't mind coming back for brunch though!",

    "text": "It's a shame that I felt the need to update my review after our last visit to BLD.  We used to live close by, so we'd come for happy hour quite often.  I still love the sangria, although I didn't notice it advertised on the menu anymore.  I had to ask the bartender to make sure they still had it.    This time, we ordered the chorizo chili fries.  We had ordered this previously and loved it.  It used to come with a dollop of sour cream, green onions and tomatoes on top.  It now just comes with the chili.  It was super disappointing because it needs that bit of cool creaminess and crunch on top to really make this a dish worth ordering again.    We also ordered the seared ahi tuna, which we had also ordered here previously.  It had about 6 slices of tuna and a blob of hummus with roasted red peppers on top.  The tuna was sitting on a tasty wasabi cream sauce.  When we had ordered this item before, it came with pita chips to eat the hummus with.  This time, there were no pita chips in sight and the bartender told us they didn't have them anymore at all.  What is the point of wasting money by putting hummus on a plate when there is no medium by which to scoop it up?  They might as well lower the food cost of the menu item and delete the hummus all together.  I think if they added a sesame slaw or something on the side, it would go much better and it would actually look like a cohesive dish.    I think the problem with BLD is that they have too extensive of a menu.  If they narrowed it down and concentrated on making fewer items into more stellar dishes, people would be more likely to return.  That's just my hospitality degree talking.",

    "text": "For the Women's Cup Final, 14 of us went to BLD to watch the game and to have a drink. There were 3 parties there. Our big party, 2 women in a booth and a sad lady at the bar. We arrived a little late and it looked like my friends had ordered drinks and snacks and when the US scored, we cheered! How exciting! We loved watching sports @ BLD. Then...the female bartender \"shushed\" us. She shushed us? For cheering in a bar/restaurant? In a very, very empty bar I might add. This is not a library, my friend.  Game over.  My girlfriends saw that terrible act and gesture as well and said the other bartender was giving them sass so that was the final straw. He said something along the lines of, \"You guys need to be more quiet since there are other patrons here.\" Right, ONE other patron. Give me a freaking break.  We asked for checks and left. The sad lady at the bar seemed to be the female bartender's friend. She looked like a hot mess and was visibly frazzled. Sorry, not my problem. She was still drinking champagne though so it couldn't have been THAT bad. The two girls in the booth left by the time we got our checks. They were most likely not impressed by the staff as well. It was appalling. Did something change? Ownership? Management? BLD just lost a TON of business. Yesterday and the future. It was convenient since we all work at Intel and live within a few miles. BLD you have lost patrons that used to love going to your place to watch a game. But this type of service has unraveled the fact that your menu is mediocre and over priced. We found out later that evening from a friend that BLD has had a number of food code violations. No wonder the place is empty.

The staff is all very accommodating and bring water and treats for your four legged companions.   Okay, here's what we didn't like:  - our server was SUPER slow. Our drinks were never refilled and our plates were left on our table until we had to ask for them to be removed.  We also had to ask her to bring our check AND pick it up. It's annoying and totally detracts from the overall awesomeness of the restaurant.   We'll be back. It was isolated (we hope) and I hope to re-write this post. For now, this is where it is.",

It took 7 minutes for a server to come and greet us. We said we wanted to order right away since our daughter was doing the baked pancake. It took another 5 minutes to get the drinks out (water, coffee, apple juice). The server was kind and even made a remark that they rolled out a new menu and she wasn't one bit familiar with it (bizarre). I sat at the restaurant and started reading the reviews on Yelp. Seems like 3 stars is the going rate and that this new BBQ place is riding off of the original BLD. The food was mediocre. Overall, not worth the $75.00 we spent and we won't be back. Menu must have over 60 items and everyone that works there seems to walk around stressed. Owner always responds saying he appreciates the feedback but where are the changes being made? We miss the OG BLD.",

    "text": "Wife and I stopped in for breakfast on a whim. Inside decor is trendy/chic and the service staff were all amazingly friendly and helpful. We did not experience any sort of disinterest from any of them as some of the other reviewers have noted.  My wife ordered biscuits and gravy and I ordered the California eggs Benedict (bacon, egg, avocado). Food came quickly, but unfortunately my wife had to send back her biscuits and gravy because it was not the traditional white sausage-gravy she was expecting and hoping for. Instead, it was some kind of brown gravy that had an odd taste. It would have been great on meatloaf, but not breakfast biscuits. The waitress apologized and offered something new, to which my wife requested French toast. The manager stopped by and also apologized that she didn't enjoy the meal and told her the replacement would be out asap. Once received, the French toast was adequate enough for her to eat half, but not to finish.  Meanwhile, my meal was also just mediocre. The hollandaise sauce was exceptionally sour/tart and not rich/savory like I've always had from other restaurants. I had to look up recipes when I got home so I could learn how hollandaise is made to help pinpoint what I was tasting. Turns out most recipes call for lemon juice, so I'll just assume my breakfast got a triple shot. As heavy-handed as they were with the lemon, everything else lacked notable seasoning and flavor. The eggs were watery tasting and bland, the bacon appeared to be standard, thin-cut Oscar Mayer, and the mashed up avocado (nearly guacamole) lacked salt and was a bit bitter; possibly under-ripe.",

My husband's plate tasted like onions with some steak on the side (he hates onions and was not told it was on the fried steak). We both agreed McDonald's has better tasting food. The mimosa tastes like cheap champagne. I will not be back. A tip for the chefs at bld, don't try to recreate the wheel. At this rate you'll be wanting to sell square wheels, figuratively speaking. You're trying too hard to make your food look good, and it tastes pretty horrible.",

We were there after a morning of hiking and there was no one there... it was 3pm their slowest time. We were the only people on the patio. They took forever to take our order and then didn't even seat us. Two girls were at the bar and pointed to the patio. My daughter ordered a smoothie that was on the menu they finally brought. The food was good however very plain. The server seemed irritated that we were there. She asked if she could bring more water and my daughter asked for another smoothie....to this the server said, \"no, could you order something easier\" !!!! we thought she was teasing but wasn't. She said they were very difficult to make and took time so she couldn't do another one. Mind you, there were two girls at the bar and NO customers. My daughter then asked for juice. the server said, \"as long as it was easy\"!!!!! WHAT! I tipped her 20% because i work in retail however i am livid that i allowed her to refuse us what was clearly on the menu. These new servers are a reflection on the ownership and management and the sad part is that she was probably the manager!!!!!!! Needless to say I was highly disappointed! the only reason you got TWO stars is because I could have my dog there. AND she never offered the dog water or a treat! Take head from other pet friendly restaurants!!!!!!",

Pork had a nice taste from the marinade but was over cooked. The butter nut risotto was more of a soggy rice dish than a fresh risotto. Way over priced for quality and quantity of the dish.  Service was good at the start and then he disappeared. Not once did he check in on how we liked the dish.   My main problem was the atmosphere and how loud it was. They have speakers pointing down over the tables with loud music. It raises the sound level and soon everyone is screaming over the music and each other. Add to that a happy hour and it carries a loud bar atmosphere and not one of a restaurant.  Will I go back? I might go back to try the breakfast but will not go back for dinner.",

Wine's are $2 off and their appetizer menu is always good.  We enjoyed the flatbread and cheeseboard and both of them had good sized portions.  We regularly eat here and highly recommend to anyone looking for fresh quality food!",

Our meal was atrocious. I had the peppered seared tuna salad and in my third bite I chewed on a twist tie. That went back. My son had a pasta dish with meat and he received a piece of cartilage that was the size of an egg yolk. They did take my salad off the bill. I guess that was a plus... We won't be back. See ya BLD",

Both were amazing but I have to say my favorite part of the meal was the thick cut bacon, its kind of like a ham steak.  This was incredible.  I liked it so much I ordered my second bloody mary with a side of bacon in it.  Don't knock it till you try it.  The best part was the bloody marys are $3.50 all day.  With bacon you do pay extra though!  We have since been back for lunch and several other breakfast and were equally impressed.  Also try the BLD iced coffee.  I will try and post a picture of the bacon mary.",

I thought the spaghetti squash would be interesting to try, something out of the ordinary. I explained to the hostess/waitress I was a pescatarian and asked what she'd recommend as far as fish or vegetarian. Without hesitating, she excitedly said the fish tacos. Went with her recommendation and they were just a little better than terrible. The fish pieces were much more breading than fish, grease oozed out during each bite, the spice was non-existent, and the semi-warm corn tortillas looked and tasted like they came out of a 99c store package. The only thing that saved these meal were the decent pico de gallo and red chile aioli layered on top. The presentation was pleasant as well. I also liked the cilantro-lime dressing on the small (and kind of expensive) side salad. All told, I probably should have tried Planet Sub next door.",

    "text": "I had a friend in town and wanted to take him to a restaurant I know is unique, has a decent atmosphere and has great food. Well, I found out on Friday night that BLD is not one of these places! We had possibly the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant...our waitress (Anna) was absolutely horrible! Because there were 10 of us for dinner, we called ahead and the hostess had a table ready and waiting for us by the time we got there. It was busy...so without a reservation, it was great to have her set aside a large table for us. However, our positive experience went south very quickly.  Our waitress came up and asked if we wanted something to drink. My friend asked if they had any Makers Mark. The waitress did not know and said she would check, but I was reading the cocktail menu and noticed a mixed drink that had Makers Mark. So he went ahead and ordered a Makers Mark and the rest of the table ordered their drinks. Guess what showed up along with the rest of our drinks, the cocktail that has Makers Mark in it...this was just the start. After returning the drink we did not order, we started making decisions on dinner. I knew I shouldn't ask her any questions about the menu, but I couldn't help myself. The first question I asked was, \"How is the special tonight?\". Her response, \"I am not sure about tonight, but our specials are usually a mess!\". So my friend asks, \"How is the meatloaf?\". She said, \"I am not sure, but is it usually REALLY salty!\". I would think the management of this restaurant would highly discourage any of their employees to respond about their menu items in this manner! So we all order our food and it comes out in a reasonable amount of time. One of the dishes came out and it was just not good. Because our waitress was nowhere to be found, I grabbed the hostess and she got the manager for us. He was nice and said, \"What would you like instead of your current meal?\". Our friend chose the fried chicken and it came back to the table fairly quickly. I also asked for some crushed red pepper for my pasta. The waitress said they did not have any crushed red pepper, but the other server that was bringing us our food went into the kitchen and grabbed some for our table. I showed the waitress what the crushed red pepper looked like and her response was, \"Oh...I thought you were talking about...\" and she then jestured with her index finger and pointed to her head. That stopped everyone at our table...it just got quiet. What does that mean??? We were all speechless! Then when it came time for our bill, remember how the manager asked my friend what he wanted in place of the first dish he ordered? Well, it just so happened the replacement dish was $2.00 more on the menu. So she removed the original and put the new item on the bill...for an extra $2.00!!! In my experience from working at restaurants and by dining in several, you remove the meal completely from the bill. Instead she charged us for the more expensive item and her response when I questioned her was, \"I didn't know what you wanted to do...\" The manager never came back over to check on us after the issue with the first dish and when I asked for the meal to be removed, they just removed the extra $2.00 it cost for the different meal. I looked out for the manager and he was laughing it up at the bar with what looked like some regular customers. There was no follow up or attention paid to the table that got stuck with the waitress that was clearly not qualified to work at any restaurant! It will be very difficult for us to go back to this restaurant. We go here frequently for breakfast and have always enjoyed the food. There are a few good folks that work there, but service is spotty at best. This was a very disappointing visit and I was embarassed to take a friend from out of town to what we thought was a good restaurant!",

    "text": "Here's the thing.  We're pretty big fans of Cork, so when we learned about BLD we were super excited to go.  Sadly, our first experience was really bad.  Because we loved Cork so much we decided not to write a review until we had gone a 2nd time.  Could be a fluke, right?  Wrong.    Here's the breakdown.  Visit 1:  1. We received chicken that was still releasing pink (not clear) liquids.  When we asked them to give us new chicken the server literally asked \"oh, you want that more well done?\" as if there is another way to serve chicken. 2. After getting the chicken back we found that they didn't actually replate the dish, they just put new chicken on it.  So if the pink liquid did contain any bacteria it was definitely still there. 3. Both my husband and I had some pretty terrible \"digestion issues\" that I wont go into detail on. 4. The servers seemed genetically engineered to avoid their tables.  In the 2 hours we were there I'd say we saw our server three times.  Visit 2:  1. The service was a bit better today but... 2. Both my husband, myself, and a 3rd guest had \"Bridesmaids\" style reactions to the food within a few hours of our visit.  I'm talking total upper and/or lower GI evacuation.   Both visits I'd say cost roughly $30 per person and we ended up sick and annoyed.  I will never return.",

    "text": "Went here yesterday for breakfast and today for dinner; Spring Break'll do that to you.   Breakfast- ordered the bacon and eggs which doesn't sound exciting,  I am well aware. But this was the best damn bacon and eggs I've had in a loooong time. Maybe ever.  And I'm not much of a breakfast potato fan, but their home fries are beyond delish. Made with Yukon gold potatoes and clearly a lotta love, they were crisp on the outside and buttery/creamy on the inside.  The portion was filling but not gluttonous. Who wants leftovers at breakfast anyway?   Dinner, oh dinner. You are fresh in my mind so I love you most of all. Ransom was the most attentive waiter we've had in a long time. He was more than happy (dare I say eager?) to answer the 492 questions my husband and I asked about the menu.  I ordered the short rib entree with Boursin mashed potatoes and asparagus. I did finish pretty much every bite, so I can attest to how uberyummy it all was. What my husband ordered for an entree doesn't matter (he loved it,tho) b/c he got the mac and cheese for a side. I can't even think about that mac and cheese without hyperventilating a little. Ransom said they used a white cheese from Ohio b/c we asked. Because it was in a class of its own. Because it puts all other mac and cheese to shame.    Now that I've had the B and the D, I need to go for the L soon,I realize this. But I had to review while this is fresh in my mind.  If they are this good on their second week open, I tremble to think how scary good they'll be given a little more time. So I don't sound like a total brainless lunatic who drank the Kool-aid, I have to make one suggestion. Plain iced tea instead of just mango would be a nice option. And that is truly my biggest complaint.",

This last time I was there, our server did not come up to us for almost 20 minutes and that was just to get our drink order.  She was rude, unhelpful, did not know the menu, had no suggestions.  Then when we told her we were ready to order she no joke blankly stared at us.  So there was this awkward silence and I just started ordering.  Then she interrupts me to say she will be right back to take our order.  WHAT?! alright.  So anyway, i'm looking at my bank account statement today 2/2/2016 (I was just at BLD on Sunday 1/31/2016).  And I see I was charged twice for the same thing on the same day.  I am like, great!  I was already not happy with my experience from there.  Then this.  My rent just took out and I overdrafted because of them double charging me.  So obviously I call them right away.  This rude girl answers the phone - doesn't give her name.  And basically tells me there is no manager and there is nothing she can do about it.  I even told her about how I overdrafted and this was affecting my account and me paying my rent.  She did not seem to care at all.  Told me to call tomorrow.  CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?  Like what kind of place runs their business like that.  I will not ever be back there again.  OH AND even though there food is good for the most part.  They do not know how to poach an egg for the Egg Benedict's, and that specific plate typically comes out cold.  THAT IS ALL.",

    "text": "I heard about this restaurant from the radio station 103.9. I was listening to Monti's morning show and she began talking about how great the food was at BLD. We decided to visit for lunch. The menu was interesting and had a lot of choices that were different. Not the same old same old. I asked how long BLD had been opened and was very surprised when he said two years. I had never once heard of this place until now.  We ordered the Dr Pepper BBQ pork sandwiches. He got onion rings I got sweet potato fries. All of it was delicious.  The only reason we may not choose to visit this place is that while the waiter was helpful, and he eventually warmed up...it appeared to be an effort.  The manager, or whom we believed to be the manager never even said \"boo\" to us. He must have walked by us four times and tried hard not to make eye contact. We were there at a non busy time of day, not the height of lunch hour. He wandered around the restaurant, visited their wine cellar. We just felt, like in other restaurants where management cares about their customers, he would at least stop by once and ask how we enjoyed our meal.  He didn't stop at any of tables, so everyone was neglected. Once again, I'll say that he was not too busy.  I read the other reviews after our visit and it appears that many others feel about the same way as far as the service/servers/management treatment of customers. There are many restaurant choices for my family to choose from and we like to go where we feel welcome...not just another person to hand food to and pay the bill. I'm  not sure that we will go back, even though we saw some items on the breakfast menu that we thought were unique.",

The waiter was kind enough to remind me that this was the case with Eggs Benedict.  One of the eggs was so underdone that the yolk literally slid out of the runny poached egg white.  It looked like it gave birth in my plate!  On top of that, the Hollandaise was way too tart.  The waiter brought out another poached egg floating in water in a cereal bowl as a replacement.  I looked at him with a \"what the h@!* am I supposed to do with this\" look.  He took my plate and the bowl and returned with it on a toasted English muffin on the same plate...sans Hollandaise.

Some of my favorites: Bloody Mary, Veggie omelet (add a meat), mac & cheese with bacon, an iced latte, anything with the pork, meatloaf, waffles with bacon, anything on the small bites/happy hour menu.    The patio is dog friendly and will bring your pup water.  Some of the bartenders give out doggie treats.  They'll also make your pup a meal if you order one!",

    "text": "Ate lunch at BLD on what was their 2nd day open. Summary: Good food, but unorganized service.  There was no signage on the main door or any kind of indication they were open for business. (There was still a gate on the patio waiting to be installed). But we had called ahead and knew they were open.   The food: I ordered the iced green tea and the grilled portabella salad. My friend ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade and the turkey/brie sandwich with sweet potato fries. Our food was all very good.   Service: A waitress was attentive and tried to answer all our questions, but it was clear she didn't know that much about the menu. They were even out of whatever bread the sandwich was supposed to come on (seems odd for opening week). And when they brought us our menus, they brought us each a breakfast menu but they only had one lunch menu left. This seemed odd since there were only a few customers dining at lunch time. How do you run out of lunch menus?   They were very polite and tried to be helpful, but it just seemed like they were all \"new\" and not quite ready to be open yet.   The breakfast menu looked the most appealing to us -- so I will be back to try it. Hopefully they have the kinks worked out by then.",

A tablespoon of watery \"gravy\" over a nearly flat biscuit doesn't work. Bacon should be crisp and unburnt - ready to go. Not charred, flaccid and greasy - as if already spent.  Scrambled eggs should be fluffy, or at least not dry and rubbery. Unless stated on your menu, your eggs should not contain quantities of Black Pepper or other spices. This is dangerous. You don't know who might be violently allergic. Tasted bad to boot.  The chunk potatoes were undercooked, even though asked for crispy.  The tastiest part of the meal was the Chorizo potato soup. The Chorizo could have had several tablespoons of grease drained in the kitchen and would still have been quite greasy - and not floating across the plate. Still, it was the best dish of the morning. .sigh.  What was looking to be a promising new place is showing signs of apathy towards is customers already. Quality slipping, lame excuses by staff \"we make our own egg substitute\", - it's just disappointing. I may not be back for a while.",

The potatoes were obviously cook hours prior and dumped in the fryer.  Just potatoes, no onion or other stuff.  One slice of bread, not two.  The pancake was $4.50 for one 12\" pancake.  The syrup had some type of film on it that kept it from pouring from the container.  She had country fried steak.  Awful.  Overcooked and the gravy was greasy.  Oh, I wanted a simple iced tea...nope...had to be green tea or mango.  You will get a better breakfast at a Waffle House.  We may try again for dinner, but I was very disappointed.  What was good?  Very short wait and the wait staff were friendly and efficient.  Oh, and they can scramble eggs.  About the only positives.",

Two of our three dinner entrees were great (burgers), too (one was a total disappointment, unfortunately - beet and arugula salad that was so wilted, it never should have left the kitchen).  I'm giving them a 3.5, owing to that salad (fortunately, my girlfriend was full enough from the appetizers).",

In fact, that's probably the number one reason why I come here SO often - I don't have to compromise on my meal when I want to eat out with my child.   Atmosphere is pretty hip and modern. They did a nice job with the space. Only thing is that the music they play can get pretty loud in the evening. Hard to talk to friends unless you're right next to each other.   My favorite part of their menu is their green chile pork tostada which is only served for breakfast. It's also a HUGE portion of food and could easily be shared.",

We have gone probably 5 times since they opened and every time we've had terrible service, even when we were one on 2-3 tables and they had 5-6 staff on the floor. It normally takes forever for drinks. Many times we've seen our drinks sitting,poured and waiting for a waiter and after 10 mins we've gone and got them ourselves. At that point the beers were warm or mixed drinks had melted ice.  Every time get our food after a long wait then the server never asks how it is or if we need anything. We just ask for boxes and the check before anyone comes to check on us.  We have tried to order take out before and their phone system was totally messed up. They have you press another button to order but apparently it directs you to the bar and they don't do take out after a certain time but that was explained on the phone prompt so we sat on hold for over 20mins. I finally called over and the hostess took our order.   If the owner should consider hiring new management and staff.",

    "text": "BLD is the one place in Chandler that I really want to like, but after three visits, I just give up. They have a great-looking menu, a hip-kinda vibe, and all the promise in the world. And that's where it ends.  A disinterested hostess will invariably seat you in the one table you'd least prefer. Near the kitchen entrance. Near an angry baby. Whatever.  Next, one of several equally disinterested servers will arrive to take your drink order and by the time you've worked up a good thirst, drinks will arrive. If you're lucky, it'll be the drinks you actually ordered. If you're really lucky, they'll be good.  The one saving grace on the breakfast menu is the Monte Cristo. A+, seriously. Everything else is average, despite how it reads on the overpromising menu. And don't worry about the prices: just pretend you're in Scottsdale or, say, Midtown Manhattan, for the entire meal. If you remember you're in Chandler, you'll just get angry.  Like the breakfast menu, the lunch menu equally overpromises, but that's okay, because you'll wait just as long to receive your food. If it's not over or undercooked, you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a sub-par meal.  BLD looks and act like they want to be a BFD (big friggin' deal) but they need to start caring about both their customers and their food first. A good menu doesn't make a good restaurant if you don't deliver the goods.",

    "text": "It was the waiter's last day - which he was quite happy to tell us all about. Because of that - I will not write anything about the service. He definitely had a case of last-day-itis. A friend and I had just created paintings of our pooches at a nearby storefront - and we were ready for a late lunch. First thought was the restaurant next door to BLD - as we've both enjoyed their other location and I am friendly with the GM. It was BUSY in there, and we were told it would be about 45 minutes for a table. We were both quite hungry, and didn't want to wait that long to be able to first order. So - we went to BLD. It was close to empty. That should have been a sign. When one place has a 45 minute wait, and another restaurant that shares the parking lot only has customers at two tables - there's a reason. A reason we should have heeded. We opted to share a couple of dishes. One was the seared peppered tuna salad. (The abbreviation \"R.R.P.\" shows up throughout the menu. I asked so you don't have to - it's Roasted Red Peppers.) The chef wasn't as familiar with the concept of \"seared\" as I hoped, the tuna was quite well done. A couple of slices had a hint of pink in the center...but just a hint - and definitely not what I know to be seared. We also shared the grilled cheese sandwich. The menu describes it as thick cut sourdough with Havarti, brie, tomato, and bacon. Sounds delicious, right? Too bad the execution was soggy and bland. The fries were okay. I guess that's something. There was also a happy hour menu. One of the appetizers we asked for was house made chips with hot sauce and blue cheese. (The restaurant we first went to, but was too busy, has something like this that we both love - that's one of the reasons we wanted to go there.) Not only was it completely lackluster - but I mention the appetizer after the entree, as that's when it showed up. I don't see any reason I need to give this place a second shot. I'm rarely in this part of town, and now I know that when I am, I will just go to the other place - and no matter how long the wait is, the food will be good.",

We are not fans of the \"Sysco\" restaurants in our neighborhood, so I'm always telling my husband we have to drive out of our hood to try better places. BLD was pretty much a Sysco place, nothing priority about it. We went here because we saw it on Check Please Arizona, and the reviews and pictures here. We ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon. They literally put about a teaspoon of hollandaise sauce on each egg, unlike the photos I saw here. I ordered the biscuit and gravy, there hardly wasn't any gravy, the eggs literally covered up the gravy, I thought maybe they just forgot it. In the gravy was hardly but 2 or 3 little bitty chunks of what they called sausage. I singled out a piece and could swear it tasted like hamburger not sausage, my husband agreed. Nothing like the photos I saw here with gravy run amok. In all honesty this place rates right up there with IHOP or VI, closer to my house, less expensive and taste about the same. So the B part of BLD, I won't be back. Maybe I will try the L&D part, someday?",

It was a little messier then expected, but really good. Cooked medium the way I like it with green chile pork, bacon, pepper jack cheese, and a pretzel bun. The cheesecake at the end was a huge hit as well. It had Carmel, pretzel, and health bar on top. So good. I heard many times from our group that they would all be back and it was a great place.

I ordered the Biscuits & Gravy Specialty breakfast which came with 2 eggs, 2 slices bacon & potatoes ($12.95). The eggs were served on top of the biscuits & gravy, which would be ok, but that was the 1st clue that there wasn't enough gravy, since I could barely see it under the 2 eggs over easy. Before I had even finished the 1st biscuit the gravy was gone, so I asked for a little more gravy. The result was an additional 1/4 cup (2oz maybe) and an additional $2 on the bill, and there still wasn't enough gravy to compliment the remaining biscuit. If you like paying $19 before tip for a cup of coffee and a \"specialty\" breakfast in which the special isn't present and only barely appears for an extra charge, then this is your place.",

Delicious!!! :-D Unfortunately for the staff, there was a larger party near us, and a few of them were not going to be happy with anything they ordered! :-( Sarah, our server, replaced one of the patron's meals but she still wasn't happy! Kevin went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make them happy, not charging them for their 1st meal, but also taking half off the second one they still didn't like. It was discouraging when patrons can be so inconsiderate of a staff's efforts, because the staff REALLY wanted to please!

Our server, Franco, was funny & did a good job of servicing. The service did seem a tad slow considering it wasn't very crowded but we weren't in any rush so it was no big deal. Besides, if we had wanted fast food we woulda gone to Taco Bell or something. The food at BLD was hot, the menu was extensive - I mean huge; almost to the point of being overwhelming. I definitely want to go back & try their breakfast items (which are served all day, BTW).",

We just happened to have visited both at dinner hour.  Tap list impressive too!  Check out the blackboards!  Seasonal Taps and specials listed there. Staff never really drew any attention to them and I felt kind of stupid once I realized there were there.  Location is weird because after the TV's at the bar and the cool back wall, this side wall feels hidden somewhat; not focal. So I missed it entirely until last night.  Service was still good they were busy- maybe 12-15 tables/ bar seats.  She was running the bar (college baseball WS on) and serving tables.  She likely took more on because there was only 1 other server.   Food came out quickly.  Used the Free App checkin and didn't care for the green chili pork queso. Too thick and color was off putting. Both of us had burgers, goat cheese and plain w/fries.  Loved them 100%!!!   We will try the B or the L maybe next time too!",

However, I go to a restaurant for food and the breakfast I got to go was eh, not to mention very expensive. Cost me nearly $20!!! for one meal, coffee and juice.   I asked for egg whites with turkey sausage, an English muffin and hash browns. The turkey \"sausage\" was not sausage at all but rather a ground turkey patty with diced pepper mixed in. Not at all what I was expecting and it was not described on the menu. Had I known what it was going to be, I wouldn't have ordered the turkey \"sausage.\"   The hash browns were mushy, not fully cooked, unevenly cooked and certainly not crispy.  The English muffin was fine. It was buttered which I didn't mind as I like it that way but some people might prefer it dry or with the option of jelly and/or butter.   The portion of the egg whites was plentiful but they were unseasoned and egg whites need something. Would have loved salsa to go with them.   The orange juice was great and the coffee was awesome. The coffee really impressed me with its unique flavor that stood on its own -- no sugar or cream needed.   Overall impression: The breakfast disappointed me but the drinks and service were fantastic.",

Until I realized it cost almost $13 bucks. Kinda wanted to cry. I'm not the richest person so I felt pretty bad.    Also they didn't separate the check for a 12 person table. So that was a disaster between the table.  There menu is so massive and the most basic things are the worst things to order. Where is Gordon Ramsey honestly.

I've got a few favorites but kept it simple today with a burger and fries and the chicken & waffles... I wasn't alone!   I do enjoy the large high table they have. Perfect for group gatherings so make sure u call ahead if you're having an informal meeting or event. The table holds about 16 people and they have a private dining area with curtains. I've been here for several group luncheons and business meetings and the nice thing is they have a full bar (and wine room) to accommodate people.  Plenty of good beers on tap and atmosphere makes me feel stress-free. I don't do coffee, but they have a barista and plenty of options along with many breakfast cocktails (ie bloody mary & mimosa's) to compliment the meal. You will occasionally catch a local celebrity in the house but rememeber, they are just like us... all about gettin' they meal on so let them be. Outdoor patio and bridge bar is nice so enjoy it before the summer hits!!!",

As she was coming back the server was about to walk away and we wanted to confirm the side for her sandwich. The server turned around and rolled her eyes and asked if she had to repeat the side options. We couldn't believe it! Two of us had to ask for refills.

It's very clean inside and the overall atmosphere is pretty relaxed. We appreciated the giant flat-screen TVs (on mute, with closed captioning) that kept us entertained while we waited for our food.  I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles (boneless fried chicken, bacon waffles and scrambled eggs) and my husband ordered \"The Pig\" omelet (bacon, ham, cheddar, sausage) served w/ red potato home fries and a side of pineapple chunks.  The chicken was perfectly fried with light breading and in turn, was not greasy at all! The seasoning was just right, juicy and I love how it's boneless so I could dig in without having to worry about bones. I am smitten!  The waffles were also very good and when I read that they were \"studded\" with bacon I thought it would be small bits of bacon but I was wrong. So wrong. They were jam packed with bacon strips so for all you bacon lovers out there, take note!  I should probably ask my husband for a review of his omelet and potatoes but for now I can tell you that he cleaned his plate! I had a couple of his potatoes and they were nicely seasoned.  The service was OK. Not great. Our server seemed a little aloof and when he'd walk past our area he wouldn't even look over at us unless we flagged him down. There were 3 other tables of people (that we could see) who kept craning their necks looking around for him to get their checks. Hopefully it was a fluke and the service here isn't consistently inattentive. This is why I didn't give BLD 5 stars.  I should also mention that the kitchen churns out food at a steady pace so that is always a nice thing to see.   Overall, the portions are large and the food is yummy. BLD gets a thumbs up from me!",

The service is really good, beer options are good, happy is good.",

My husband and I both ordered beers with our lunch but they didn't arrive until after the food. Bottom line, I'll continue to come and eat here  even if they are kinda slow.",

Usually the hawaiin bread style French toast with bananas is another favorite, but this time it wasn't as moist and tender. Was dry as though bread didn't soak up enough of egg batter. BUT customer service was excellent and they switched it out for fluffiest cake like pancakes ever :)  Also, cappuccino and mocha lattes are coffee shop quality!",

    "text": "I went back. We were hoping to get their Restaurant Week menu but they only offer it at dinner. But we were all starving so we stayed and ordered. We sat at the huge shared table I mentioned in my original review that they used as a business table. The Cardinals game was about to come on and we wanted a view of the TVs that I  also mentioned in my previous review that showed a vile news program. They didn't turn the game on at the start but finished the KC/Wash game and we missed a Cards field goal. (Bitter)  The service was GREAT today. I should have gotten our server's name, she was timely, informative and super friendly. Long blonde hair and knew triathlons.   About the food - first negative - no kid's menu and the prices are so high.   My older boy got the chicken and waffles, this is no LoLo's but the kid really liked it. Small piece of what appeared boneless chicken, lots of waffles with BACON crumbled on top, and a big pile of scrambled eggs (totally unnecessary for the kid) $13  The younger boy couldn't find anything he wanted so we got him the BBQ sliders with the caramelized onions and aioli on the side with fries. $10 He wasn't impressed.  The husband got the short rib sandwich. Huge, spilling over with meat and caramelized onions, the bread looked rustic but soft with onion rings - he loved it. Enjoyed with Sessions lager. $11.75  I got the smoked turkey, thick bacon, thick tomato slices, sprouts and pesto aioli on a croissant. Huge sandwich I could only eat half and was very full. You really can't screw up this sandwich and it wasn't a risky order - I just needed something good after a long run morning. I also got the sweet potato fries, perfect with small but visible bits of salt. Enjoyed with a hoppy beer from Boulder Brewing $10.75  It was a much better experience then the first time. They serve you a ton of food we have three boxes in our fridge right now and the prices reflect that. The total was $67 for four lunch/breakfast meals, two sodas, three beers. Now that I typed it out, thought about the quality of food and beer, it is fine. It was a good meal except I missed the start of the game. Boo.",

Breakfast Chicken Fried Steak: Portion amazing, breakfast tots seasoned and cooked w a light oil. The steak was one of the best I've had: panko breading and seasoned and an eye appealing garnish. I do believe there was a side of fruit too.  Simple Breakfast: Portion again good but not as heavy, obviously. Two eggs over easy, bacon, potatoes, and toast. All was excellent and timely. My friend ordered the fried chicken and waffles. The portion was small but the quality looked and as I've been informed was excellent.  The Goat Burger: A well designed burger, the textures and eye appeal were as satisfying as the flavor. Thick all natural beef patty topped w goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomatoes and BACON JAM! Yeah I said bacon jam.....   Hands down this is a place you gotta try. The food is prepared w organic produce and local when available. The quality of the product is what stands out here. Did I mention the have a solid happy hour too?",

    "text": "Caroline & I had breakfast at BLD in Chandler yesterday (NE corner of Dobson and Germann) and were quite pleased. As those of you know us know, we don't eat out much because Caroline's cooking is so much better. But we keep trying to find places to love. BLD may be one of those places.   We were greeted at the door by the hostess with beautiful eyes and a fabulous smile. A small touch, but it immediately made us feel welcome. So many stores get this first, simple step so very wrong. BLD got it right.  The atmosphere is good - kind of a warm, modern Chipotle-ish interior - not schlock-country or faux-dining room like so many breakfast joints. But of course the main reason for being there was the food.  The menu is simple and not overwhelming. A large enough list of choices without being too many. I liked that. (Often, restaurants with huge selections are not great at anything. Better to be narrow and deep than broad but shallow.)  The service was courteous but not intrusive. We took some time making our selection and the waitress gave us that time without giving us attitude. Thank you. Caroline selected the Spanish omelette and I chose the vegetarian.   Both omelettes were served with potatoes that were actually very, very good. So often, breakfast potatoes are either too salty, too raw, too bland, too soft, or just too much. These were just right. Again, thank you.  Both omelettes were distinctive and tasty. My vegetarian omelette was bursting with good vegetable flavors - portobella mushrooms, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions - and was well seasoned. I enjoyed eating every bite of it, except for the bite I shared with Caroline. Her's was much more a meat-flavored dish, and was savory without being too much.  My coffee was terrific. I don't know why so many places get coffee wrong when it is so easy to get it right. BLD got the coffee right. They also offer coffee-bar drinks. Caroline had the cafe' breve and it was very nice. Of course, if you start with good espresso, it makes everything else fall in line.  Brent, the GM, dropped by our table and chatted a while with us. He told us that both he and the three owners all live within a couple of miles of the restaurant. What a pleasure to be able to support local businesses and to be rewarded with good food, good service and a good experience.  Good job, BLD. Check it out.",

Maybe it was the bad taste in our mouths from the dressing \"incident\", but needless to say, when the food arrived it was all just sub par.

I wouldn't even guess at the caloric intake for this cardiac arrest special, but it was well worth it.   As for my equal delicious pre-ER meal, I ordered their Blue Burger for $14.00. My burger was cooked properly, to medium/medium rare with a warm pink inside (see photo), then let to cool to keep all the juices inside.

Our drink order took another 15 minutes.   Food, some ordered lunch which seemed like the better option and three of us breakfast. The pancakes one had were good, the biscuits and gravy were so bad my friend didn't even take a second bite. I had the chicken fried steak and it also was not good. It lacked flavor. And the gravy tasted like Campbells cream of mushroom soup!

But I have had normal experiences as well. It seems to be hit or miss. I took one star off for the inconsistent service.  Food is always the correct temperature, delicious and fresh. I would suggest this place to a friend.",

    "text": "Finally, I've found a breakfast place in Chandler that I really enjoy.   The restaurant is well decorated. The seats were comfy and spacious. I ordered a latte instead of regular coffee. It was a bit bitter even after adding sugar. Nevertheless, I was glad that I tried something different. For entree, I ordered a Hawaiian french toast. It was fluffy, soft, covered with fine powder and slices of bananas. The syrup that they served it with was still warm. I really enjoyed it a lot. I took a bite of another order - biscuits and gravy. It was very delicious and took another 5 bites after that :)   Our server was great. She gave us refill for ice tea without asking and was super attentive. Even though she didn't come by much towards the end of our meal, it was only because she was super busy. Overall, I think it was outstanding. I'll definitely come back here again to try their breakfast special or dinner.",

Not smoked, sliced paper thin, and if it was properly seasoned Texas style I couldn't tell cause I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on it. Really though you can't expect a place like that to smoke their meat, and it was still rather tender which is always good, not to mention the barbecue sauce was ideal to what a good barbecue sauce should be. Not too sweet and a touch of smoke with some spice. Just please change the name of your \"Texas style\" brisket cause that's gonna offend some Texans as they tend to be proud people. Great spot though!",

My gut told me to exit as soon as the drinks were delivered.  Before I start my rant let me tell you there was our table of two and another table of two in the entire restaurant, that's it. Our waitress was Diann, her attitude and customer service was despicable. She was one of those waitresses that just chucks something on your table and walks off real quick, before you can bother her with something else. I think we genuinely inconvenienced her by asking for a tea and coffee refill, and yes we had to ask it was not offered.  I honestly cannot give anything better than an ok review on the food due to the customer service leaving such a bad taste in my mouth.",

Bartender is bitching as she brings us our drinks & our waitress disappears. Waitress comes back & takes our order (6:45pm). 7:05 pm, Food is excellent but wine is bitter & tastes old.

    "text": "BLD has been a go-to staple of chandler for years - the food has always been good and very tasty.  When BLD first opened, I would give them 5 stars, but over the years they must have changed management or owners, because the service has dropped a lot. There used to be more vibrant, more experienced servers working here, it had a way different vibe. Now it's mostly older, less experienced servers who tend to slow things down, and frankly they're not as friendly. I had a server recently named Jay who was just painfully slow, forgetful, and really bad at his job to be honest. I enjoyed my breakfast entree, but I didn't enjoy waiting 40 minutes to get eggs on my table with missing drinks and sides. He also never apologized once for screwing up several times. I miss the old servers and service back when they opened up, it was more bubbly and more welcoming.  That aside, the food is still very good and their breakfasts are satisfying. The eggs and omelettes are filling, portions are hearty, and it's a good place to fill up. Be wary of coming on Sundays after 9am, it's jam packed and you'll end up sitting on a bar stool if you're lucky. The early bird gets the worm.",

Our friends had two kids under 4 and their talking/cries/giggles were matched by people drinking and fellowshipping all around us.   The menu is extensive, so chances are I could've just ordered the wrong thing. I'm definitely willing to check them out again. I loved how the waiters would come around and engage the kids! So cute. But our waitress would disappear for long periods of time, it was hard to snag her throughout the lunch.   I ordered the \"Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich with a side of BLD Mac N Cheese\" and the hubby ordered the \"Pig Omelette\". The sandwich was overwhelming, so much meat and cheese. I forgot to ask for no mushrooms so that definitely took away from my lunch. The Mac n Cheese was excellent! I found my sandwich okay ... just not superb and the meet had tons of fat! Hubby loved his omelette and he ate every bite of it.   Overall, as I said pretty good not great.",

They have a \"virtually everything\" concept that includes a drive-thru window and a pretty large menu. From the drive-thru you can order barista-made coffee beverages, protein shakes, juices, smoothies and some foods. The interior is upscale casual contemporary and features an indoor/outdoor bar. They also have a very large community table that seats quite a few people. Dinner includes a wide variety of choices that includes comfort foods like fried chicken and waffles, meatloaf, burgers and large salads. Lunch includes sandwiches, burgers, salads and tacos. Breakfast includes Eggs Benedict, hashes, waffles and breakfast burritos. BLD has a pretty good happy hour with discounted prices on drinks and appetizers.",

    "text": "You can't spell \"bland\" without B-L-D.  Sure, that's a little harsh, but I couldn't pass up a good line.  BLD (Breakfast-Lunch-Dinner) is a nice-looking restaurant.  It's standalone building in front of a new strip mall, that seems to be anchored by the always-packed Oregano's.  It's bright and contemporary, with lots of natural light.  There's a bar on one side of the restaurant, and there's outdoor seating for when the weather isn't so painfully warm.    My wife and I stopped in around 11am, perfect timing to taste 2 of the 3 meals advertised by the restaurant name.  After a lot of menu reading, I went  for coffee and the vegetarian scramble, and my wife chose the chicken sandwich with apples and brie.  (Important note:  My wife's lactose intolerance caused her to omit the brie.)  She also opted for the pineapple cole slaw over the other fries and other sides.  There were several smoothies and espresso drinks available on the menu, but we passed on the fancy beverages.  The coffee ($2.50) was heavily roasted and very strong.  Refills were quick and included in the (steep) price.  My scramble ($10) was all in one piece... technically I thought it was a fritata, but I'm hardly an expert on such matters.  I liked the mixture of vegetables in the scramble, especially the leeks.  The veggies were thinly sliced so you get egg with every vegetable bite, and the swiss cheese on top was a nice choice.  The roasted potatoes were some uninspired spuds, without much seasoning or distinction.  I'm not going to dwell on my wife's chicken sandwich ($11).  Let's just say she asked for plain, and she got it.  The pineapple slaw was very disappointing, though.  There was barely a hint of pineapple flavor in this Falsely advertised cabbage.  I think BLD suffers from trying to be too much.  It's a coffee shop, juice bar, restaurant, and bar that serves all 3 meals, with gourmet hints in their everyman menu.  Got it?  For real gourmet food, try Cork (which has the same owner as BLD.)  For comfort food, you can do better for cheaper.",

    "text": "Average food. Trendy and clean interior but the food was like your average American breakfast and brunch spot. Nothing that wow'd me. I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was expecting a nice hearty sized fried piece of chicken or two, but got one sub par sized piece, if that. I wasn't the only one, as I heard another gentleman grumble about the chicken portion/size. Pretty disappointed by the size of serving. The fried chicken itself seemed dull and boring in flavor. No batter if any, almost as if they used a skinless breast meat with no batter. The waffle was good. A little above average. I tasted my other patrons food, the country fried chicken and pancakes. Again, no wow factor, average. I kind of expected more from the restaurant considering the nice interior and lay out. Maybe it was a hit or miss kind of thing. Service was great though. But all in all in terms of food, average.",

The wait, however, is questionable. Both times I went on a Sunday and waited 10-20 mins at most for a table. The service could be better. Those who wait on you tend to take your order after you've looked around for them; busy or not, service is critical. The community table gets the worst service in my opinion (will never sit there again).This place is convenient and provides a break after Sunday church service. One day I'll try lunch and dinner, they have a decent menu.",

    "text": "Atmosphere = ***  Unfortunately, my first impression of the place was the smell of cleaner.  The chemical smell in the air lingered for the duration of our stay.    The layout is nice, spacious without being cavernous and tastefully decorated, if somewhat lacking personality.  Just clean, standard modern decor.  I went at 8 am this morning (Sunday) and there were only half a dozen guests.  I am guessing that, once filled with people, the vibe is a bit more exciting.  As many have mentioned, BLD is located in the soul-sucking, cultural-void suburb that is Chandler.  The lack of tasty treats in the area definitely contributes to the buzz around this place, since the only other decent restaurants of the non-chain variety are in 'Downtown' Chandler.    The drive-thru option is solid gold, (you have to call ahead for meals, of course.)  Very smart idea by whoever orchestrated the build-out.  Service = ****  Very good.  We were greeted immediately by the hostess.  Our server checked in with us often enough to feel welcome and taken care of, but not so often that we felt smothered.  When we had a complaint on our food, he handled it smoothly and without any trace of attitude, but did not overcompensate with repeated apologies either.  Well done.  Food = **  Our breakfast was disappointing.  Conceptually, the menu has a lot of promising ideas, but the recipes/execution were lacking.  There was a good variety of choices without being too many, (a giant menu is almost always a bad sign.)  My vanilla latte had WAY too much vanilla, could barely taste or smell the coffee at all.  I left half of it behind.  The boyfriend and I are benedict addicts, so that's what we went for.  He had the short rib, and I had the crab cake.    I felt two ways about the citrus hollandaise on my crab benedict.  The texture was superb, thick but somehow light and very creamy.  The flavor, unfortunately, was far too sweet.  Combined with the natural sweetness of the crab meat, it made for a more confectionary experience than savory one.  The crab was good (no imitation crap), but sadly underseasoned and crying for more of a sear on the outside to lend some texture and color.  The eggs were a bit overdone - when I cut into them I got a trickle of yolk instead of the flood of it that all benedict-lovers crave.    The short rib benedict featured meat far too dry for the cut.  The dryness left the meat with a charred aftertaste that wasn't incredibly pleasant.  The red wine hollandaise was decent, but lacked the acid that I assumed a red wine hollandaise would have.  The eggs were a bit better on this go-around.  The potatoes served with both meals were barely room temperature.  We told our server and received a fresh portion, which were hotter, but still had the same rubbery texture as the last.  That being said, they were beautifully seasoned.  There was plenty of good flavor going on, but texture was really lacking.  There was no crunch or bite, only chew chew chew chew.  Our server automatically brought ketchup in portion cups, which seemed a bit wasteful.  A plain old bottle would have sufficed.  With some recipe tweaking and practice on the line, both of these dishes have potential.  I will definitely give this place another try, but it won't be anytime soon.   With the lack of options in the area, I am guessing they will be successful.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed on my last visit at BLD I first heard of them on one of my favorite food blogs I've been going there for 2 years with my husband and every time I went to service the food was excellent never had a problem. Today my mom was on that side of town with me and she wanted to try a new place so I recommend bld. Then it turns out our Hostess was our waitress she had a horrible attitude. My mom had asked her if they have nachos and she said no we have fried kettle chips with sour cream and green onions on it. We placed our order next thing I noticed there's a sign on the table offering a happy hour variety list on the list clearly said nachos bacon green onion and cheddar sour cream when I pointed that out to my mom  was kind of mad that the waitress wasn't attentive to point that out.  So my mom ended up ordering a pastrami sandwich which came with sauerkraut in Thousand Island my mom had ask the server if they could hold off on the sauerkraut.  when our food arrived are french fries were cold the my mom's sandwich which was a pastrami sandwich was one slice of pastrami chopped up and put into a sandwich just imagine one slice. When my mom had mentioned something to the waitress about the meat the waitress said would you like to reorder something else instead of saying hey if you want you can pay a little extra and I can get you some more meat. Didn't receive our refills till we were done with our meals. Just super disappointed this was my favorite place for a while for homestyle comfort food. I also felt just a cold vibe from the staff after I paid I had walked up to an employee and I have asked them if management had changed and it seems like after I asked that question was asked they became defensive Tony if I had mentioned these complaints to my server and I said yes my mother did she really didn't have an answer for me industrious I won't be going back",

I've also had their sandwiches (WHOA food - no kidding, a sandwich can feed 2 people easily - they're huge) along with their homemade chips (yum!), and also I have had a pasta chicken dish that was tasty as well (not fireworks status but tasty nonetheless).  Their coffee is spectacular (read: strong) as is their red sangria (don't worry, didn't try them at the same time).  Overall I love this place.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because their homemade chips aren't consistent - sometimes REALLY good, sometimes just \"meh\".  When in the area you must stop in.

    "text": "The wife and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a mid-afternoon lunch and cocktail.  The server, Joe, took forever to get to out table.  when he did, he hitched up his leg and \"scratched the inside of his thigh.\"  while talking to us.  My wife ordered a wine that took 25 minutes to arrive (after we flagged down our server).  Lunch took 45 minutes to show up. We were actually standing up to leave when the server came around the corner with our food.  My wife ordered a veggie sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The sandwich had turkey so it had to be remade.  This time, there was no lettuce or the spicy mustard ordered.  When we asked our server, he returned with raspberry dressing. This was pointed out and he finally returned with the correct mustard.  By this time, the croissant was a greasy, sloppy mess.  I ordered the french dip which was OK, but the beef was cold and dry which leads me to believe it was made first then sat and sat and sat...  the potatoes in the potato salad had good consistency, but instead of a creamy mix, it was little potatoes swimming in a cream based sauce.  Not sure if this was correct, but ...  The comment card in our bill folder was even pre-filled.  I flipped it over and wrote my thought for them there too.  I hope this place gets its act together.  Also, the staff should stop worrying about how they look and worry about the guests.",

There were numerous managers lingering about and way too many waiters/staff.  It was absolute chaos.  For one, they have only one tiny entrance to the kitchen, so there was a constant traffic jam of employees standing around waiting for food to be ready.  Many employees seemed to be running around back and forth for no apparent reason. They were very disorganized...I hope they get things figured out soon.    Food: The food was actually pretty good....hence 2 stars and not 1.  The guys had burgers which they very much enjoyed.  I had the green chili pork tostada.  It needed more pork, more green chili sauce, and less beans. Definitely too much refried beans. Flavor was very good though.  Coffee was great, but with one big problem:  it would be nice to have a carafe at the table.  I was left waiting too long for a refill several times over the course of our meal.  They really don't need the full carafe of creamer at the table...a simple porcelain creamer container would have done just fine.  Perhaps they can replace the cream filled carafe with a coffee filled one!   Overall, I think BLD has a lot of potential, but they have many kinks to work out with the service before I'd be back.",

This time around ordered chicken fried steak and steak and eggs, not very good. Chicken fried steak was bland & over cooked, gravy tasted of raw flour and the \"steak\" claimed was shaved rib eye but I received what resembled carne asada. Requested it cooked med rare, received rubbery, gristly, well done. Coffee was good, though first cup was full of grounds. On the positive our server was very nice and the beans and potatoes were tasty. For nearly $40, breakfast for two, not worth it and won't return, Sorry.",

I decided to bring my parents here for dinner to show them exceptional food, but we were treated poorly. It took at least 15 minutes for my beer that was already poured in the glass when I received it. Not only did the beer take a while, the appetizer did as well. When we repeatedly questioned about our appetizer, our server became frustrated with us. Because of his frustration he had the manager bring the app. The manager asked how we were and with unhappy faces we did not answer, and the manager proceeded not to ask about our poor attitudes but simply walked away. Throughout the meal the server never stopped to talk to us to enlighten our moods, except asked us how we were in passing. Never stopping once, not even to drop the bill!   I myself work in the restaurant business and understand the difficulties when dealing with unhappy guests, but by no means was this correct way!!!",

If you don't set your expectations too high, this is a great place to grab a quick bite or meet with friends, family or for business.   If you're in a rush or just need to kill some time, their bar is pretty good and they have a drive through for take out, which is pretty convenient.  I was craving fried eggs with bacon, and I got just what I was craving. A good portion of crisp bacon, 2 fried eggs and sour dough bread. I had to order extra bread, though because it came with just 2 half slices.   The grapefruit juice was pretty good (if you like grapefruit, of course) and the latte was good as well. The potatoes on the side could improve a little bit.  All in all, don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed.    I go to this place plenty of times so instead of writing and up-date i decided to edit this one. They DON'T have ice cream or any desert :(   BTW, their patio is dog friendly :) I don't have a dog, but I thought that was cool",

I was very disappointed about the orange juice. I was charged $4 for a \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice and when I got it, it tasted just like from a carton. I asked the waitress, when she finally came around and she said, it is fresh squeezed, we just order it in and it comes in a jug...??? SO that too me is not fresh squeezed and not worth $4 a glass.

I have ordered many things...the open faced sandwich is delightful, the waffle has bacon in the middle, the short rib eggs bene and the breakfast burrito. I normally go back to the waffle because it is so good! I don't normally eats sweets but the bacon with syrup is prefect and for $5 (if you order the waffle as a side) is a great deal! Lunch is another time of day you can find me at BLD. I love taking clients there and the food is always spot on. You must get the Prosciutto & Fried Goat Cheese salad. SOOOO GOOD! I can't really order anything else... Happy Hour is one of the best around. Great prices with unique food options (no chicken wings and potato skins here). Get the Ahi (See pic). Trust me! Had dinner here the other night and our server suggested the Braised Short Rib Pasta. It was unbelievable in a prefect Pesto sauce (see pic). The patio is beautiful and allows dogs. They actually have a dog dinner availble for your pooch.  GO HERE ANYTIME. You won't regret it and say \"hi\", I'll probably be there.",

Also, i asked for strawberry jam and didnt realize until i put it on my biscuit that they have me raspberry. $30 later, I'm still hungry and headed home.

Several of us initially selected the happy hour special of soup and grilled cheese, but the tomato bacon soup apparently is very spicy, which didn't appeal to members of my party. When we looked closer at the menu, it appeared that a lot of the dishes involved a lot of peppers...and a lot of goat cheese.   Anyway, I took advantage of the happy hour beer specials, but unfortunately I really hated the second beer (something by Deschutes that I think might have been skunked). Our server disappeared for the first of several times; another server ended up getting me a different drink.  Two members of my group ordered quesadillas, one chicken and one steak; when the runners brought one to the table, they said, \"here's a chicken quesadilla...or steak, I don't really know,\" and plopped it down. My squash spaghetti arrived several minutes after everyone else's dishes. My dish was underwhelming: the goat cheese (of course!) was congealed in clumps (as one might have expected), the sauce was very oily, and the dish had no discernible seasoning.   After we had finished, our plates lingered for far too long. Once we received the check, we actually never saw our initial server again, having to flag down another server to get our credit card processed.  I'm not really sure what this place is going for. At the price point for dinner, the food and service need to be much better than it is.",

My wife reminded me before going that they have slow service. It's apparent that management and owners are inept at developing or implementing a training program for their staff. While waiting for our waitress to reappear, the older female manager walked by with a dark piece of toast on a plate, and another waitress commented saying \"that's pretty dark\" referring to the toast, and the mgr still walked it out to a table.   A waiter who must have had the assigned area where our new table (we came inside due to weather) walked by, was told by another waitress that we moved inside and shrugged. He never came back or our original waitress. After 15 mins of not bring acknowledged or our order taken we walked out.  I thought mgmt was the quality control at most successful restaurants. This place could be much more successful if they paid closer attention to the little things.    We walked across the parking lot to the new Cold Beers and Burger joint, to try them out for the first time. Great food and service. Try that place.",

How unfortunate that current management/ownership does not recognize nor applaud your commendable efforts..Demotion appears to be the method of ousting those who \"bring in the buck\"..To that end and on a positive note, friendships that have been made here at BLD over these years are near & dear and will contine on..Peace out..",

My wife and I decided to have a late lunch, around 1:30 and found the restaurant almost empty.  We ordered water and Arnold Palmer, first AP was ok, refill was just tea.  Wife ordered the Roasted Chicken & Brie - On Sourdough, w/ Melted Brie, Crisp Apples, Spinach & Strawberry Dijon Mustard 11.95 and I got the \"Goat\" Burger - 1/2 lb. All-Natural Beef Patty, Fried Goat Cheese, Roasted Tomatoes, Greens & Bacon Jam 12.95, the Roasted Chicken was ok, nothing to write home about.  the \"Goat\" Burger was an absolute mess.  It was supposed to be medium, it had a crust like a burnt rock, it was covered with cold bacon jam, stacked with the roasted tomato's that were soggy and then topped with a ball of the fried goat cheese.  This was all encased in a dry pretzel burger roll.  I ate the tomato's, and hacked my way thru the burger patty, my side was a salad, 3 tablespoons of greens, a 3 croutons.  I should have taken a picture but by the time i found the patty it was too late.  My recent previous time there was with my Son during the holidays, and our experience was somewhat the same, this time the Tuna was well done and i hail from Hawaii and know of my \"Seared Tuna\", my Son had the fish tacos and they were a little greasy.  He commented that with all the other restaurants around there that had waiting times it was a little strange that we got seated immediately.",

Now, my friend is a tough food critic. In all honesty he is way more picky than me - after all I grew up with siblings who would lick or spit on your food to try to claim it and you would either have to tough it out and eat it or starve. In short, my palette is much less sensitive than his and his cooking experience has him even higher standard than myself.  With that said, even upon my first bite I noticed that my chips were stale (or under-cooked or overcooked, not sure if there is a taste difference). Being the lenient one, I charged through the pile of chips for the Queso. Some of the chips were not bad. Aside from that, I thought the Pork Queso dip was pretty tasty. I am normally not one to enjoy tomatoes but I really enjoyed them in this dip. I really wish the \"simple\" part of my meal - the chips - would have been better. I think for the price I would have been better off driving downtown and checking out NachoBot, which is a bare-bone nacho shop... but hardcore delicious and I'm stuffed.  My friend had the Chorizo Nachos and really had to bear down to eat them. Not that he was gagging on it, but he wasn't super thrilled by it either. He didn't address it there (see comment below about asking for food) but did address them later in an email. On one hand, I wish my friend addressed it there so that I could have reviewed their response. On the other hand, sometimes it is better to not file a complaint in person - I hate having the management come over and give you free stuff - and maybe my friend didn't want free stuff either.  I cannot comment directly for him - all I can say is that he has told the restaurant before of issues with his food (again, see comment below about the server asking about food).  Our service was OK but my friend was really bothered by the employees during their idle time. I had my back to the employees but he said that they were all sitting/standing by the kitchen and essentially messing around. Now, I'm not one to be all hardcore about what people do at work when they have idle time, but they could at least do it out of sight of customers. My friend said that they kept looking over and laughing in our direction - coincidence or were they laughing at us, I cannot comment. All I can comment on is that it could have been more professional.  The restaurant itself was pretty cool looking - almost a little too upscale for Chandler, LOL.  With all of this said, this is the general basis for my review. My friend wrote an email to BLD to tell them that he did not enjoy his meal. BLD responded, in a way, unprofessionally. They seemed kind of personally offended. With that said, I do agree with them in part that the issue should have been addressed there instead of post in an email. However, call me shy or maybe just preoccupied but I don't ever remember the server asking \"how is your food?\" either. While this is nit-picky, most restaurants today ask this which I believe prompts you to comment directly on the food instead of just the service (i.e. \"how are you doing.\"). I think if they had asked that then my friend, who was much more dissatisfied with his meal, then he would have addressed this there in-restaurant. Who knows, and maybe this is splitting hairs here. The personal service was pretty decent aside from this even though the \"idle-service\" being kind of weird with the employees sitting around texting and possibly laughing at you. Decor was awesome. Food was half-good (my pork dip, not the chips), but the prices outside of happy-hour seemed a little high to me. Last but not least while my friends email could have been addressed differently by him (in person, not email) they could have seemed a little less personally offended.  Bottom line is this - I doubt that I will visit again and it is not necessarily a place I'd recommend to others. The main reason that I would not suggest BLD is mainly due to the price - my food wasn't too bad aside from half the chips tasting stale. I can get far more food at other places for less money and I don't have to buy on the HH menu to keep costs down. Looking at other reviews on here it seems that other reviewers also felt the prices were high as well.",

    "text": "What happened?   My wife have been frequent breakfast and dinner patrons of BLD - and always loved it - but something has changed. Took a client there for a casual dinner this evening - and was pretty disappointed.   I haven't been in for a couple months because of travel schedule - and in the meantime the menu apparently changed. I love a place that experiments and changes up the menu. However, BLD seems to have removed 4-5 favorites - and when I asked the waiter if it was possible to be flexible enough to whip up one of the \"previous favorites\" - the response was more less a shoulder shrug.   Again, love the attempted creativity - but the waiter admitted that many people have asked for the same discontinued dishes...might be worth rethinking the menu. Let's not forget - we're in Chandler - not San Francisco or New York.   Likely out of the rotation for us. Disappointing.",

BLD is a great place to hangout and get to know the team, who always make you feel welcomed.",

We were discussing an issue with an order with the bartender which happens on a busy holiday weekend when apparently Liz G felt the need to eaves drop and comment. We are regulars here and probably had 1000 meals over the past 7 years. They're not all going to be perfect but to feel the need to write a negative review about a conversation you weren't even involved in is just ridiculous. She said she wasn't coming back which is probably a good thing. We have so much fun at this place that we don't need people like that ruining a good time.",

We only sampled the App food like the nachos which were average, the queso dip which did not have enough cheese, and the quesadilla which was good but not great.  The biggest jam was the service.  The bartender did not have many guests and our table of four were drinking at a pretty good clip.  Somehow we always found ourselves hunting him down for another beer.  He was nearby but always seemed like he has never worked a service job in his life.  Not good!  The decor is a strange mix of contemporary industrial with clean lines and almost IKEA like furniture.   Large stained concrete slabs were the bartop in our area.  The bathrooms are just toilets and you share a wash area with men and women which is different but not really that cool.    Again this place is so close but I think they need a few more elements to click before I would return.",

    "text": "Today I'm totally impressed with BLD. We went to lunch as a team, as a celebratory event for one on our team who's been with us for a year. Five of us ordered, and two of us had the server come out to ask us to pick different entrees, because they had run out of both of the items that we had ordered. They genuinely felt bad that we had to order some different things, so they gave us TWO complimentary desserts, which were phenomenal!  They tried to up their service, because of the inconvenience. I was impressed at how much they worked to be attentive and orderly. Wow!  For my entree, I wanted to try the Mediterranean Tuna salad, but I was one of those that had to order something else, so I chose the Grilled Portabello Salad, and it was very tasty.   Try the Dirty Chai, one on our team ordered this and raved about how delicious it was.",

I ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the chicken fried steak. My husband got his and I got a waffle. When I asked where the chicken was the server said she thought I only ordered a waffle then I had to wait for the rest of my lunch. My husband didn't like the chicken fried steak because the gravy had too much of a flour taste. He also ordered a peach/mango smoothie which tasted like pineapple. We asked the server if he got the wrong drink and she told us that all the smoothies are made with pineapple juice. So if you love pineapple I recommend the smoothies. The atmosphere was nice, but probably won't be going back.",

Our server was Lexi, it wasn't particularly busy so it really should not have been that much of a wait time to getting someone to pick our order but the it wasn't that big of a deal. I will say that the reason that we are marking three stars is the drinks were awesome with the Chandler Mimosa and the signature burger was actually really nicely put together. But the jalapeno burger was definitely something that you should stay far away from. There was nothing jalapeno about it. When you put it next to the BLT Burger it looks like a Jack-in-the-Box dollar menu burger with a little bit of cream sauce on it. It was a little depressing and we end up sending it back and I split my burger with her. In other news I think that the drinks could do with a little bit more presentation to really amplify and showcase how great they are because that's a huge missed selling point. As a marketing and brand development expert I think that's something they should focus on.  Build up your highlights and completely toss off of the menu things like the jalapeno burger. The wings were really good but a little overpriced. Overall this place has a lot of good potential if it changes a few things they can definitely push out the competition. And thank you again Lexi for your kind words!",

The flavor was excellent, but clearly BLD is not holding the food at proper temps which is concerning, especially with pork.  I also had an over medium eggs served that had the whites still running clear.  So undercooked and unsafe, I couldn't believe the the kitchen and the server sent it out!  Other times, the service was just OK.  Managers were around, but never stopped by when there was a problem with undercooked or cold food.  Cook times are long. And, I do NOT like the community washroom.  I really don't want to be washing my hands while being stared at by the guy walking out of his room still zipping and adjusting his pants...   If my girlfriends want to meet there for lunch, I'd reluctantly go again.  Would it be one of my top choices for breakfast with family?  No.",

We went here for dinner around 8pm and it was pretty empty. We sat at the bar, which was also pretty empty, and waited a lot time to get menus or even acknowledged for drinks. The bartender was not very conversational and pretty much gave the minimum amount of attention she needed to get her job done.  After we finally got the menu I was really surprised to see the expensive entree pricing given the atmosphere etc. But they have one thing going and that is pretty good food. I had a pesto chicken linguini which was pretty good. My bf got a med-rare sirlion which came out perfect and was delicious. :) I might give this place another try during their happy hour, has potential!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking to switch things up for breakfast this past Sunday. We'd passed by BLD a few times before and thought we'd give it a try. The atmosphere is hip enough, and it seemed pretty decently busy. My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy while I ordered the traditional breakfast of scrambled eggs, wheat toast, bacon, and I ordered a pancake instead of the breakfast potatoes. First time around, my eggs were cold. Very cold. I informed my waitress who had them remade for me. Honestly, I would rather eat eggs from Denny's than eggs from BLD. They were watery and flavorless no matter how much salt and pepper I added. The toast came buttered but with no jam or jelly brought to the table. Bacon was fine as it's pretty hard to mess up bacon. The pancake was large, but really just sort of \"meh\". Nothing too terribly exciting. As for the biscuits and gravy, the entire dish reeked of onion. The onion flavor was so strong that it completely overpowered any other flavors that could have been present. Finding his dish inedible, we left having eaten between us a piece of toast, half a pancake, and bacon. Perhaps the food for lunch and dinner is better, but I don't think neither my boyfriend of myself care to find out. Overall, the atmosphere is nice, but the food was awful. We won't be returning.",

It was super bowl Sunday and most places were closing early however this restaurant was still open for an hour or so. I'm giving BLD a 1 star due to the quality- rather lack there of service and poor food quality. After waiting for 15 minutes for the server to come back to the table to take our drink orders, she then told us we were given the wrong menus. The server was nice enough, although we could tell that she just wanted to be off her shift already and in no hurry to serve us. My grandmother's order came out wrong. Not to mention we all had some sort of food-related sickness just hours later. My aunt called this morning to let them know of the poor service we had had, their response was, \"we will let the kitchen know.\" Which leads me to believe they not only do not care about the food they are cooking/serving but also customer service doesn't matter to them either.  We will never eat here again. Do not suggest this place what so ever. They don't even season their potatoes!",

Chicken is always fried perfectly so it's moist inside, waffles are fluffy and absorb just the right amount of syrup.   After my first taste of the deliciously moist chicken, I thought to myself -- what was missing? A condiment! Ketchup and ranch would mask the flavors, I needed something more subtle, and maybe a little sweet. Honey Mustard of course! I worked myself up, proud of myself for knowing just what I wanted.   Well, they don't have honey mustard. 4 stars.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place.  I have several friends that told me about it.  They have a good vibe, and an interesting menu, but unfortunately after 2 bad visits in 1 week I won't be returning.  I went with the family last weekend and had a great waiter, but the food was just so so.  The drink wasn't good, and the burger was well done instead of medium.  They gave me a free drink, and the manager came over on the burger.  I told her it was just feedback on the burger and I didn't want to make a big deal about it even though it was burnt.  I went back last night with the family.  My daughters Mac and Cheese came out in less than 5 minutes.  It was salty, and tasted bad.  If a 7 year old who eats Mac and Cheese at least 4 times a week doesn't like it, then it has to be bad.  Then we waited 20 minutes for drinks that only came after we reminded the waiter, and the whole time we were out of water.  Our appetizer, tempura zucchini,  was more like beer battered and the zucchini was too thick and under cooked.  The Southwest Aioli looked like it had a crust on the top, and liquid floating, plus it was hot.  Not good for a mayonaise based product.  Ordered a chicken dinner to split.  It was burnt on the outside and pink on the inside.  It sat in a bowl of mush which tasted horribly.  We didn't eat hardly any of it, and told the waiter who didn't acknowledge the problem, but did go show the manager which happened to be the same woman that we spoke with the last time we were in.  Instead of her coming over and talking to us, they just took the meal off.  I appreciate that they have not charged us for some of our items that were screwed up, but there seems to be little concern for the customer.  They need to fire the chef, fire the expediter, inspect their wait staff for consistency in quality of service, and inspect what their customer experience is all about.   We eat out every day and are always looking for good places.  This place has potential, but it's being managed poorly.",

They offered to remake it but he said no since it was his error.  He had onion rings as the side and said they were good. His biggest complaint is the bun is so big compared to the burger. We found out they do have a smaller bun for kids burgers, which he will request next time.  I had the chicken biscuit. The biscuit was huge and moist, quite good. The Chicken was also large but didn't have much flavors me. It has sausage gravy over it. I'm sure any would like this, for me it was overwhelming. The breakfast potatoes with it were basic. I think I ate 1-2 of them?  Because of great service and good quality, I would try here again but the meal I ordered was just ok. I did have lots of leftovers which stretched for 2 more meals.",

I sat at the bar where Aaron was a great host and kept my drinks full.  I ordered \"The Goat Burger\" -- Yummy!  Oh serve me a sweet bite: goat cheese, bacon, roma tomatoes, and arugula.  Oh how it pleased my palates. The burger was sweet and the scent of the arugula traveled thru my nostrils with delight.  This was one good burger and I must recommend it!  The place is like a lounge and with an awesome wine rack in the back.  I totally dig the designs and the communal table in the middle.  I recommend sitting at the end of the bar where the table curves around where you can chat with your friends and of course, Aaron, which showed and offered up some of his favorite wines -- Thanks man! - Enjoy!",

We were seated a large booth that could easily fit 5 (there were 2 of us) but was nice and roomy. Decor is modern and some of the design aspects were interesting yet weird (ie: only seeing part of the kitchen, large communal table). We started off with drinks- the honey bee was nice with honey vodka, cranberry juice and ginger ale. Beer selections range from local breweries (San Tan and 4 Peaks) to domestics.   Our waitress was very attentive and service was very good here. I ordered the Cali Benedict, which came with 2 poached eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato and hollandaise. My fiance ordered the BLD burger with sweet potato fries. The BLD burger was GIANT and came with 2 beef patties, green chile pork, onion straws and a poached egg. The Benedict was good, eggs poached perfectly, the homemade potatoes were OK. The best part of the burger was the green chile pork...mmm!! Onion straws and beef patties were over cooked. One thing I did notice is some tables seated after us did get their food before us- which is something mentioned in other reviews. It wasn't a big deal for us as we were enjoying our Sunday brunch meal.  All in all, we liked this place and would return.",

The location isn't idea for the place to stand out, as its in between several other restaurants in the area. Upon arrival, I immediately noticed that non of the staff were smiling. As someone who use to manage a restaurant, I find that if the smiling staff sets the tone and vibe for the customer. My waitress/ server also seemed out of it and not entirely focused on being there. The dinning room was fairly empty for a dinner service. The one thing that most surprised me about BLD was the menu. The restaurant offered BBQ options. I ordered a beef brisket sandwich, with short ribs. The beef brisket was pretty good, although it needed more fat to be sliced in to give it a juicy flavor. The ribs were dry. The locally made BBQ sauces however made up for the dry ribs. Overall a good place to dine, just would like to see more lighting and more smiling and aware people. Would recommend this place for a late lunch or early dinner.",

    "text": "Three and a half stars: not bad, not great, and overpriced.  Disclaimer: I've only been here for dinner, and I eat fish but no other meat.    My husband and I started with the roasted beet salad, which had generous quantities of beets, yummy fresh goat cheese, arugula and candied pecans.  It was simple and the olive and oil and sea salt dressing was perfect.  The portion was also quite nice for $7.  There were only two fish dishes and one vegetarian dish on the long menu.  Frankly, I don't think it's worth coming here for dinner at all if you don't eat meat.  Breakfast and lunch might be better, but I haven't checked.  I ordered the Salmon, server over a parmesean risotto.  The fish was juicy and the risotto was flavorful, but the quality of the ingredients of both items was maybe a step above Chilli's - nice, but not my idea of an $18 meal.    My husband ordered the Tilapia, which surprised us by arriving on top of a large salad (we expected vegetables on the side from the menu description).  The fish was just ok - not bad but far from fancy, and definitely not a $16 item by my estimation.  Overall, the place is nice-looking but not quite as fancy as it seems to want to be, which seems to describe the food as well as the decor.  The service was really friendly.  I'll be honest: we were given a gift certificate for this place, and we enjoyed our meal, but we definitely wouldn't come back here on our own dime, even if it was really close to home and convenient.    PS I didn't care for the Malbec and I'm pretty easy to please, so see if you can taste it before you order.",

When I went for lunch, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and the bartender was very attentive.  Same goes for breakfast, even though it was much busier during the breakfast visit (I overheard a server saying they're busiest during the breakfast times).  For breakfast, I went with a tried and True, biscuits and gravy, which comes with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and potatoes.  My server asked me if I wanted some chorizo on my potatoes, which was unexpected, but later I saw that their lunch special was tacos with chorizo.  I probably should have steered clear of the chorizo, as it was a bit much, but I didn't look at the special board before I came in.  For those who like extras though, it was nice that he offered and didn't charge for it.  The biscuits were slightly disappointing, I'm sad to report.  They had a good flavor, but they were a little overbaked to the point where they were almost hard.  Also, the parts that didn't have gravy on them actually tasted of slightly burned biscuit.  :(  This saddened me, but didn't take away from the meal too much.  When I went for lunch the previous week, I got the grilled chicken sandwich, which comes with bacon on it and avocado.  The sandwich tasted awesome!  This time, the only downside was a matter of mechanics.  The bacon/avocado would not stay between the bun (which was a bacon focaccia, I believe... yum!) when I'd bite into it.  Not that big of a deal.  I mean, the sandwich fillings were hefty!  Anyhow, good food here.  Excellent service.  Try it out if you're in the neighborhood!",

The place is clean and the staff is ok but the bartender that is typically there for brunch is awesome.   I for the love of me can't remember his name- brain fart ...but he gives great recommendations on what to order,  knows the menu and ingredients and makes awesome cocktails.",

Time to give our business to someplace with servers who actually show up with smiles happy to help and make your visit enjoyable and actually SERVE you. In the current state this restaurant will not last which is unfortunate because they do have pretty good food.",

Came in waited not as long as they said , but sat at the table for a while  before a unhappy waitress came to us , I only say unhappy because she acted like she didn't want to be here . No smile no personality .  Order our food , we do love the food that's what keeps us coming back not the servers so after ordering meal came asked for mustard and ketchup , waited about 5 mins for them to come to our table .. A server brought it to us with again no smile drop and left as fast as she could   We really do love the Huge portion of foods so if you like good food big meals come here but don't look for friendly conversation , hasn't always been this way have been coming here for two years .   I should say The only bad part of the food is potatoes they sever with breakfast , they come on every breakfast , but don't eat them , hard , and dry , think they make them early in the morning before open .  But we aren't coming for the potatoes  They do greet you when you come in and leave",

At first glance we notice they have a unique and giant sign outside displaying the food. We walked in service was fast. Server was very good. The dining area was clean and modern.  Restrooms were original and clean.    I ordered the Short Rib Eggs Benedict and my wife ordered chicken and waffles.  Everything was going great until we tried the food. The meat was flavorless, the English muffin was soggy, and the hollandaise sauce tastes out of a jar. who ever cooked the food must hate preparing such a boring recipe.   Overall, this restaurant lacked originality and soulIf you like to look at a \"pretty\" venue, this place is for you. If you love great tasting food, try somewhere else.  .",

My wife had the Dirty Chai-but in this version, the expresso melts the Chai powder. She loved it.  The decor is hard to describe but to me it's a local favorite so that makes it divey. It has a comfortable atmosphere.  Our server was great explaining the menu options including the drinks mentioned above and provided excellent service.   On to the meal. I naturally ordered the \"Wise Man omelette\" - a 3 egg omelette with red wine braised short rib, cheese and veggies with country potatoes.  The potatoes were deep fried and super delicious. The omelette was good but I prefer bacon over shredded beef- though no fault to BLD.  My wife ordered the chicken fried steak meal with potatoes, eggs and gravy. She wasn't too happy with the chicken fried steak because it was pounded down to about  1/4\" and difficult to cut through.  But she loved the deep fried country potatoes.",

Also cut into it was was well done although ordered medium rare. I called to give a heads up and was told, \"but the chef made it himself.\" Well the chef either doesn't know how to cook a medium rare burger and follow a recipe or I was given a well done patty with a slapped together wrong burger. Huge waste of $15.   ... Have also eaten in here 3 times and service is slow which is why I attempted pickup. Wouldn't recommend. Not consistent and disappointing.",

    "text": "Very sad to say that this venue has gone from being one of my favorite spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner to NEVER AGAIN.   A few months ago I ordered bbq on the insistence of the waiter.  They state  that everything is smoked in-house. . Not sure about that.  Baby rack ribs came smothered in bbq sauce. Tender, but definitely reheated.  The corn bread was so crumbly it just broke into tiny pieces when I bit into it--like it had been frozen and reheated.  I don't even remember the rest of the meal because it was disgusting.  My husband had the seared ahi salad which was and has been consistently good there.  Fast forward to tonight, we wanted to order some take out dessert.  They were out of the tres leches cake so we ordered the dessert chimichangas and the chocolate cake.  I know I've tasted that chocolate cake somewhere else before.  Like Fry's bakery or somewhere.  Definitely not baked on site.  Cold, defrosted and AGAIN smothered in cherry sauce.  Yuck.  They stuck the container of ice cream right in the middle where it was sticking to frosting and cherry sauce.  Nice.   The chimis were equally as bad. Big thick tortilla half baked stuffed with runny cream cheese.  And only 4 small pieces.  Again, the ice cream was stuck in the middle of the container right on top of the caramel sauce.  Seriously, this place used to be so good.  Now it's just dying a slow death.",

I think it's been a total of six times out of maybe the eight I've ordered to go and the order has been wrong - like entirely wrong.

I've brought this up to management's attention to try to have the issue corrected, but unfortunately the same guy still works there, and still continues to make BLD look incompetent.  Figured it was time to write this review given that I literally just hung up on the (same) guy who for five minutes couldn't walk over to a quiet place to take my order but just kept reading it to me wrong over, and over, and over again.

    "text": "My husband & I went to BLD for lunch today. I can't say that our experience was awful but it certainly wasn't great. It began by awkwardly standing at the front and not being greeted for 5 minutes. After being seated our drink orders were taken but it took quite a while before the server came to take our order. We both ordered a BLT with a side salad. The side salad had a few tiny pieces of tomato with 2-3 croutons and a ton of wilted lettuce. It was the worst side salad I have ever been served! The same wilted lettuce took over our BLT's!!! There was more wilted lettuce on our sandwich than there was in our side salad! I have had better BLT's at fast food restaurants. Our whole experience left us feeling underwhelmed and with the amount of quality restaurants in the area, I don't see us ever returning.",

After 1 refill, the waiter told us that they are running out and not sure if they have anymore.  After 1 refill, we left.  Waiter was slow and inattentive...and when a big table of 15 (or so) people left, service was no better.  Fried fish is good, but service is awful.  Too many good restaurants in Chandler....I won't be back anytime soon.",

We all loved our food... My husband had the brisket sandwich, I had the grilled chicken breast with a baked potato and asparagus (grilled perfectly) and my daughter had the kids Mac and cheese. We also wanted to try some different things there so we also had pancakes on the side and bacon on the side just to try....so hard to decide what to have with their very extensive menu! Best pancakes in town! The service from Micah was exceptional...our drinks never emptied, our food was hot and he was super friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. We will be back soon!",

Five stars for our server.  She was patient, efficient, timely and quick with a recommendation when i cpuldnt decide between two options.

I invited approximately 20 family members for breakfast today (all first timers) including five little ones. They raved about how awesome everything was. I must give a HUGE thank you to Stephanie who was so warm and attentive to making sure my large party seating area was adequate, was set up and ready before they arrived. Her genuine caring attitude cause many of my family members to think we were personal friends. And although we are not she made me feel like we had known each other forever.  Our server, Grace, mirrored the same quality, extremely personable and friendly, very attentive and a calmness that was felt by many of us. Makes a big difference with a large number of people. Along with the huge variety of dishes to choose from and the delicious food, our experience at BLD would not have been as successful without these two young ladies helping us feel comfortable and satisfied. Thank you BLD for employing people who care about people enough to ensure their experience creates a repeat customer! My hubby and I are not new to BLD which is why I chose this restaurant and we look forward to returning again soon!  Brenda in Chandler!",

Their happy hour fare is worthy of four stars, especially with a white or red sangria for only $3... and they're not skimpy portions.  I like the drive through.  They have tasty protein shakes (around $6), and you can even get a yogurt & granola to go.  Haven't tried the coffee.  Six of us met for breakfast today, and even though the place was jumping, we were seated within 10 minutes.  During our wait time, we were invited to the bar area where we ordered bloody marys and mimosas.  Feeling a bit untamed, I went with the short rib benedict, which is served with a red wine hollandaise.  It was OK, and I'm a fan of both short ribs and red wine.  The sauce was actually pink, which didn't give me the impression of red wine.  It was an acquired taste, not bad, but I'll choose a different menu option on my next visit.  BLD offers breakfast potatoes, not hash browns, and that makes daddy sad, because I'm a hash brown guy.  But they can fry them good and crunchy if you want.  The serving size of their green chili pork tostada is impressive, although I'm not sure I'd call it green chili... more of a simmered pork with some chili.  When I think of green chili, I think of El Zocalo in downtown Chandler.  BLD has many more offerings on their menu, so I've got more opportunities to fall in love.",

We came in around 12:30 this afternoon the restaurant was not very busy with just a handful of tables. We decided to sit outside on the patio, there was one other table with two women sitting and a couple at the bar. Once seated we waited a few minutes and a server appeared we gave him our drink order, he also took the drink order of the two ladies outside so I figured oh he may of just got double sat. ( I was a server for years so I understand the wait time with double seating) A women waitress appeared and brought the drinks out for the women and apparently was there server. Our server appeared several minutes later with our drinks and we were beyond ready to order by this time. My husband and I both ordered breakfast which came out absolutely delicious. I ordered the chicken and waffles, he ordered a breakfast burrito. Both came out exactly how we asked, the food was very tasty and was the best part of our lunch. Our server never came back out to check on us, we were never asked how the food was, I was never given a refill and my husband was literally getting up to find the server to give him a credit card to pay the bill and the server randomly appears. He asked us if we needed a to go box, we did not just wanted the check. The sever came back very quickly with the check and that was it.  BLD has extremely good food at reasonable prices so it is so unfortunate that I am giving it such a low rating. My husband and I travel a lot to this area and always enjoy BLD especially their breakfast, but if the service is this awful on a slow Thursday afternoon I'm not sure if we would return. Hopefully they can get it right, as we really do enjoy the food.",

So, I thought it was a fluke, so I went again and ordered the California Benedict. It wasn't any better. The plate was the worse breakfast I've probably ever had.

When the waitress came over I told her, but she didn't really respond she just kind of walked away to check what she entered into the system. She comes back and says she rang it in correctly and wasn't sure why I had received the wrong item. She was nice overall even though that interaction was a little weird. The food came out relatively fast after she put in the right order. When I did receive my food, it was fine at first but I saw the eggs were so scrambled it seemed as though there were no eggs at all or maybe they weren't cooked all the way because the entire dish was just wet. Usually eggs are noticeable in any hash, this one was just covered in cheese and the potatoes were also greasy.  I also ordered the Spanish latte which was just ok (it's not really fair to compare real cuban coffee to an American cafe I guess). My dining experience here lead to an entire day of an upset stomach and feeling lethargic. I wouldn't come back to try anything else unfortunately.",

The third table were regulars. Greeting everyone they walked by. The final straw was the server came to their table before they sat and had their drinks already for them.   I called the manager as we were leaving to let her know what happened. She made no attempt to recover us.   By the way, I was in the restaurant business for 25 years and was a manager.

Everything else here is above average or awesome. If you really are in the mood for a buffalo chicken wrap, go elsewhere.  2. They usually aren't fast. If you're on your lunch break, and want to make it back in an hour, you might want to look elsewhere.  Not saying they can't do that, but when they get busy, they get slow.",

Who wouldn't love yummy pieces of ham, slathered with raspberry preserved and sandwiched between two thick pieces of french toast. Yum! With potatoes on the side, too. Double yum.   I've been several times, for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Breakfast is served until 2pm or so, but after 3pm (ish) the menu changes to dinner only (which is my only complaint... I wish I could have breakfast any time of the day). Their lunch sandwiches have all been delicious and their happy hour menu is pretty darn good too.   There is a full bar for all of your booze needs & a wonderfully comfortable outdoor patio. One big highlight for me is that BLD has a dog-friendly patio. I can bring my pooch with me after a trip to the dog park (Paseo Vista dog park isn't too far from BLD). They always offer me a water bowl when she's with me & even sometimes have massive dog bones.   The staff have all been fantastic - friendly and knowledgeable. I look forward to going back each time!",

Their food is American Contemporary in my opinion.  They have a great selection of breakfast and lunch items.  My person favorite are their breakfast potatoes.  They are crispy and not too oily.  If you are a Mexican food lover I highly recommend \"The Other Burrito\" for breakfast.  Super flavorful and it has a good kick!    The interior of the restaurant is simply modern, which I love.  It's always clean and even if the restaurant is busy you will get sat within 15-20 minutes usually.  Get a bloody mary while you wait!  :)",

They have only been open for 2 weeks and are still working out some serving bugs as it took some time for our food to arrive.  But the server and staff were very cheerful and helpful.  Now for the food.  WOW!!  I ordered the hot pastrami with garlic fries and Kilt Lifter draft.  My son ordered the tuna sandwich with garlic fries.  I don't know where they got these recipes but for a $9 sandwich the pastrami was easily the best I've ever eaten.  The flavor just didn't quit and it was delightful from first tast to last.  The fries, just had this extra kick to them that made them a standout from ordinary fries.  The tuna sandwich is made from scratch.  No cans here.  They fry the fish and crumble the meat into a tuna spread.  Again, the flavor didn't quit and made for the most unique of meals.  Think of BLD as a restaurant with upscale food with a price tag that is more than fair.",

    "text": "So needless to say, my visit to BLD today was a bit underwhelming. I've heard a few friends talk about the food being hit or miss at times, and I've experienced it a time or two myself. I went in at around 1:30pm on a Wednesday. It was after the lunch rush and things were quiet. I think there were 2 ladies at the bar, and maybe 4 other two-tops seated in the restaurant. Our server was taking care of us and two other tables (both two-tops). It took her between 5-10 minutes to come over and greet us and take a drink order. I noticed the same situation going on for one of her other tables. When she came and took our food order she was nice and recommended the onion rings for a sandwich side because they are her favorite. Naturally, we took her advice.   Here's where I began noticing a trend in the service. It took a little over 15 minutes for our food to arrive. Now, I'm normally not a critique of time it takes for food to arrive, since I'm in the industry, however this was kind of sad. We ordered a burger (medium-rare) and I had the green chili pork sandwich. My sandwich I guarantee was cooked and just had to be assembled. The burger was mid-rare and should have taken 5-7 minutes to cook. I've seen them busier and cook food faster, there just seemed to be no sense of urgency. I noticed that the FOH manager also comp'd a two-top's French Onion Soup because he knew it took, \"a lot longer than it should have.\" Not sure if they brought that to his attention or if he had noticed. Nothing happened with ours, and the server didn't really acknowledge an almost 20 minute was for two sandwiches. Like I said, I'm not one of those to get upset or critique because I am a part of the industry.   As for the food, I've been there a handful of times and some times it has been very good, other times it was alright, and this time was just alright. Again, the food was lacking seasoning. It was just bland. Even a pinch of salt would have made a world of difference, and I had mentioned it to them before.  Going there for breakfast, I had heard their eggs Benedict menu was great. I'm a fan of hollandaise sauce so I thought I'd check it out. I ordered the BLD Benedict, which is your classic eggs benny, with ham, egg and hollandaise on an English muffin. It was incredibly salty. I thought it might just be the ham, but as I kept eating it got even worse, and it was the hollandaise that was so terribly salty. We mentioned it to our server. She offered to get us something else, but we declined and just wanted to bring it to her attention. A few minutes later the manager came over and offered to get us something else, and told us that they had tasted the sauce and it was indeed way too salty. When our bill came, we noticed that they had comp'd our two eggs Benedict orders. We hadn't asked for that and I thought it was a nice gesture. The attitude of the manager was excellent and professional in handling the situation. However, this was kind of a \"third strike and you're out\" moment for the food at BLD. I think in my five times there I have really only enjoyed one of my meals enough to recommend to people as a definite, \"YES, go there.\"   The food being just ok, and not stellar is sad but acceptable, especially since I have very high expectations because of Cork. Which, by the way, is probably my favorite restaurant in the East Valley and have the same partners. But overall, I just don't see myself running back to eat at BLD anytime soon. You better believe you can find me down the road at their other restaurant, Cork.",

Our waitress started off a bit snappy/cocky and came across rude.  I wanted to substitute roasted red peppers on a salad for avocado and she lectured me that it wasn't a fair trade. I should have asked to substitute the chicken on the salad instead - it was overcooked, dry and tasted terrible. My daughter wanted an egg burrito with cheese and ham - that seemed to be an issue - our waitress painted the chef on duty into a real jerk (not sure if he was, but that was the impression she gave).... her burrito was a \"special order\" and she would have to see if he would make it... really?  Our waitress \"frienlied\" up after a while and the food ended up being decent (minus my chicken)... I may give it another try, but am really not in any big rush!",

Not only was the table I was at getting bad service I noticed the four other tables in the restaurant were getting just as neglected. Our waitress seemed too busy making herself a cappuccino and leaning against the bar to talk to the bar guest than it was to refill myself and guests drink for 45 minutes. We had empty drinks throughout the whole dinner up until we left because she would not refill them. She never came by to quality check the food either or even just a walk by. I heard another table complaining about the service as well. She concluded the dinner by slamming the check down on the table and continue walking. There was no manager in sight for us to talk to. Overall, it was the worse dining experience ever. The food is good but that does not outweigh the horrible service. I recommend going somewhere else with the whole package.",

    "text": "My son and I dropped in today after he had an eye exam in Chandler. I had read in my Phoenix magazine that BLD was one of the best breakfast places around. Since we were only about ten minutes from there, I decided to give it a try. What a fantastic find. Even though it was lunch time, we were seated immediately...a nice table in the back and away from the front door. Within a minute there was a nice young man who took our drink order (nothing alcoholic but that is available). My son ordered the fried chicken and waffles and I ordered the Monte Christo sandwich. I think it was less than five minutes before two mouth-watering plates of food were placed on the table before us. The fried chicken on my son's plate looked like two nicely battered chicken tenders. He was really thrilled that bacon was in his waffles. From the first bite to the last, he was nothing but smiles and praise for the food.  My Monte Christo instead of being deep-fat fried was French Toast with a delicious vanilla-imposed taste, piled high with shaved ham, raspberry jam, and topped with powdered sugar. There was a warm compote of maple syrup on the side. Also on the plate were fabulously good fried potatoes with onion. They were finely crisped and really hit the spot. They also came with a small container of ketchup.   Both entrees with two soft drinks came out to around $30 which might seem a bit steep for lunch in Chandler, but believe me, it was worth every bite.   Being that we live in Maricopa, which is restaurant starved, we will definitely make BLD one of our regular places to go. It's not a bad drive from Maricopa and for anyone in the East Valley, it's on the northeast corner of Germann and Power...close to everything.  WTG...BLD!",

My husband had the baked goat cheese that came out 8 minutes after my salad & was burned...as soon as the server dropped off his appetizer she said that our dinners were up & asked if she should just bring them out.  We asked that she wait so he could eat his appetizer, a few minutes later our dinner was on the table & we were not even half done with our first course.    He ordered the meatloaf & was unimpressed and thought it was pre-made from sysco, his green beans were nuked to death and were the texture of old shoe leather.  I ordered the Mac & cheese. I figured the $8  price tag would yield a high end very good dish.  Well, kraft deluxe is not the worst thing, but I did not expect that from a restaurant.  Masteros & Flemings serve theirs for $5 and are both very good Mac & cheese dishes.  Basically I felt a little robbed by the entire meal. Total for the meal was $76.00 which included a $34 bottle of wine.  We are sad to say that we won't be back unless we hear things have improved.  The design of the restaurant was wonderful...but they need to figure out their food & service or it will be just more empty commercial space in the valley.",
