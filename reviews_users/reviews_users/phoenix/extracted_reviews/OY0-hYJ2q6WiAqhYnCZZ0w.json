    "text": "Everything we ordered from the beers to the food was spot on- the haus brats were flavorful, house mustard cleared up my nasal passages and that's a good thing.  There was not a single Belgian fry left in the basket even after they cooled down. They remained crunchy. The pickles and sauerkraut were fresh tasting because they are made in-house. It was great sitting outside like an authentic German beer garden even if there was artificial grass.  Great way to spend a sunny afternoon. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the beers and that made the experience complete.",

The kids devoured the pretzel and garlic fries. My wife had the Haus brat and I had the Pepperjack brat with sauerkraut, which was homemade and amazing. The whole family also had a great time playing the games out in the courtyard. We played giant jenga, corn hole and ping pong. We loved the food and just overall had a great time. We'll definitely be back when we're back in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Only here once, but will definitely be back.    The food was good.  4 stars.    This place would be MUCH busier if they had happy hour on the weekend.  MUCH BUSIER!  If fact, I would probably be a regular.    They have a great beer selection.  Staff was okay.   They did a great job of creating a fun environment in the back.  They have darts, washers, tetherball, jenga, ping pong, etc.  It seems like a great place to hang out.  The real negative here is that they make it a little too kid-friendly.  I wanted to try out all of the fun things in the back, but too many kids were out there just running around and hogging the ping pong table.  Not cool for people wanting to have fun and a few drinks.  I'm certain they would make more profit from selling more cocktails instead of milkshakes.   Either way, I'll be back.  - UPDATE -   I appreciate being contacted regarding my review.  I always try to be honest and fair.  I was told that kids usually clear out by 8pm.  However, as a long time Old Town resident, I know that Old Town is a day drinking location.  ESPECIALLY with the locals.  Locals like to enjoy their city by heading out early around 10am, start with a bloody, have cocktails and food throughout the day, enjoy the outdoor bar patios, and be home by 6pm.  That's just how we locals do it...  Old Town residents practically have it mastered.    My visit here seemed like I was trying to enjoy a beer in the sun in the middle of grade school recess.  Kids were running around, being loud and crazy like kids do I guess.    Just my two cents.  But of course I'll be back to try it again.",

    "text": "Maybe it was an off night?  This is the worst review I have given.  It is my Son's 26th birthday today so we met up with him at Brat Haus.  I had a really good feeling about this place due to it's current star rating on Yelp and the way it is designed.  It  has a really cool vibe.  The service and food were not acceptable.  The Scottsdale market demands good food and this place is not making the cut. My son ordered a Chorizo Dog and he sent it back (no flavor). My wife and I split a burger and they did not ask how I wanted it cooked. The burger arrived and it was well done and the only flavor I could taste in it was a strong taste of pepper?  It was horrible, I am sure they cook it to death because the quality of the beef won't allow them to cook it on the rare side.  I did not drink but we had plenty of beer lovers at the table who were ready to have a beer or two but they had a hard time getting a server to stop by and take their order.    I tried some of the other's food and the only thing I found to be tasty was the pretzel fundido.  Not sure I will try Brat Haus again.",

I also found the pretzels less than fabulous. I do suggest to try to big, juicy, tasty, meatballs. Much better choice. The outside patio very cool, an open fresh space with plenty of seating and a big ol' wall of funky art. The service was also friendly, and attentive and fair prices. Overall, it's totally worth checking out if you are in the area and in the mood for something different.",

    "text": "Yum! Everyone loves a giant salted pretzel from a street vendor or at the movies, right? Well if you try the pretzels at Brat Haus those crummy frozen treats will be forever ruined for you. And for good reason! Here they're soft, smokin' hot, big enough to share with a friend, and they come with a variety of mustards and dips. Including a curried ketchup!  What I loved most here however was that there's no pretension. These guys really know beer, and it's obvious. But it's not thrown in your face and there's no pressure to pretend or act like you know as much as they do if you don't. And if you do know your beers, they're happy to talk shop.  I came for a small tasting session and learned more than I could have ever expected. I also got to try a variety of beers and eat those yummy pretzels in the process. And just like the beer list and the menu, the decor is fabulous too. Walking around the place I spotted a massive outdoor patio perfect for larger groups. I'm not from the area but would love to return and pay them another visit if/when I'm back in town. Definitely a top spot in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I am so happy Brat Haus has stuck around Old Town. Such a wonderful place with good eats, great beer and a phenomenal patio! We actually love it so much we had our engagement party out back in April.  I was fortunate enough to attend an yelp event here some time ago which was my first experience as they were trying to generate some traffic. For a place whose name suggests a very meat centric menu, I was impressed with their vegetarian options. Many events cater to carnivores, and while still fun, it was much more enjoyable to sample a larger variety of the menu. The French fries are delicious and it's totally acceptable if not encouraged to have fries and beer as a complete meal. The pretzels were kind of stale at first taste but I've ordered them since and they were much fresher and softer. The mustard options are plentiful! 6 mustard choices deserves it's own star.  The patio truly is one of my favorites in town. Lovely even in the summer (thanks some kind of futuristic uber fan) and provides plenty of entertainment. Our engagement party guests especially loved playing ping pong and tether ball. Our food included veggie sliders, meat sliders, and the kale salad. The veggie sliders were a little underwhelming as far as texture and flavor goes, but overall the food was great. The service is what really soared above expectations. They handled a group of 40 with so much attention and friendliness. I think I may just have my birthday party here as well!",

I agree with Howard Seftel, stay to the traditional $6 brat. Good luck with the concept of a $10 brat with fries. Not a place i would rush back to!",

    "text": "Do you love beer in all its intricacies? Are you a man in need of some bro-to-bro time? Do you wish Oktoberfest could be a year round celebration?  If you answered yes to the above, then today is your lucky day son! BRAT HAUS is a bro time + beer time experience which equals a MAN CAVE MECCA!    I came here with a few Yelp co-workers for a Beer 101 class to learn all about this alcoholic beverage fermented using the sugars from cereal grain. (That little nugget is straight from my handout yessireeee!) You could tell our host was passionate about beer and spoke about it as such. The men in our group were mesmerized. As he discussed the brewing process I wished that my boyfriend was with us because this is something HE'D find fascinating. Like sports and cars, I like beer, I like to consume it, but I don't have an innate need to study it. It would be like talking to a straight man about the intricacies of womens shoes and why a platform shoe helps to elongate the length of  womans leg yet the added height helps to create comfort when walking. If you're a man, I lost you at the word \"platform.\" But despite the waning of my overall attention I did appreciate our teacher's passion and depth of knowledge.   More so I appreciated the three different kinds of beer we sampled and the GIGANTIC bavarian pretzels with dipping cheese. They were lovely and I wanted to tie one around my neck with a string for a snack. We sat inside during our class but I would have loved the outside patio as well. It's got loads of picnic tables with colorful triangle flags strewn through the air. One last thing I must mention is that the restaurant is very well maintained and immaculately clean. Big props to Payton Curry for being a smooooth operator! (Fist bump)  31 Yelps Review Challenge: #2/31",

This place should keep doing its thing exactly how they are doing it forever.

Their back patio is spacious and inviting with tetherball, ping pong, Bocce ball and large Jenga.   We actually did an event here and they were very accommodating with no food and beverage minimum unlike the other places nearby. The beers are great and the brats are even better. If you don't know what you want, get the brat sliders, you get to sample 3 of their most popular brats and it is very filling. Yes it is a little pricey for a hot dog, but please keep in mind that you are in Scottsdale, real estate is pricey. For vegetarians, fries, the garden burger and pretzels are really your only options. They should look into a veggie dog.",

    "text": "I was incredibly excited to learn about the opening of this establishment. I'm a fan of Wurstkuche in LA and try to go there when I'm in town (which isn't often, considering my total distaste for that entire city) and was happy to hear that there would be something similar in my neck of the words (albeit in Scottsdale--who sort of wants to be LA but just....isn't).   This place blows Wurstkuche out of the water.  1) The patio, even though it was 105 on a Saturday evening, was extremely comfortable due to the huge mister they've installed. Feel free to sit out on it..you'll be comfortable enough.  2) The service was fantastic the entire night. I was sure that the evening would be a total cluster**** because it was the first Saturday night they would be open. I expected long food and drink waits and general order and ticketing screw ups. None of that happened, even though there were 9 of us on 4 different checks and we were there for three hours. The servers and the food runners were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the beer, the food, and what toppings/mustards went well with what. I don't know who Payton has doing his front of the house training (it's probably him, anyway), but kudos to educating your team.  3) The ingredients are fresh and the food is all crafted in house. All sausages are made in house (and they're for sale at the front counter if you want to take them to go). The kraut is handmade. The pickles are handmade. I believe they bake their own bread. The pretzels are handmade. The fries are hand cut. All of the sauces are handmade (the hush hush sauce, a very close variant to Thousand Island dressing, had their chopped homemade pickles in it). Anything they don't make in house is purchased from local vendors/farms.   4) The beer selection rules. Belgian prices, as stated, are a bit overpriced if you ask me. However, they have some great American-made Belgian Style options (finally got around to trying a Green Flash Le Freak and it did NOT disappoint). Don't be an ahole and order a Bud Light--which they don't have. (Although, I did see they have PBR in the can there...guess it's for the hipsters).  5) The food is just really really good. Strong flavors, perfectly seasoned good. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone raved about how good their sausages were. We were also lucky enough to sample a just-crafted recipe that wasn't on the menu yet--a beer cheese fondue served with their house made pretzels. Even though we were all stuffed, we managed to devour it. Dessert was also fantastic; that drunken date cake is a must try.   Rumors abound that there will be other locations--I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a downtown location as it's closer to my house. Until then, I can't imagine we won't be making regular treks to this new place. Congrats, Payton.",

The dude who owns the place is german, and makes his own brats and mustards, which I found to be delightfully tasty. The fries, however, have been woefully undercooked on the 2 occasions I have ordered them.  The atmosphere is fun and lively, if you are going on a friday or saturday night, it might be best to reserve a table. They have giant jinga, tetherball, ping bong and a bag throwy thingy.  The service can be a bit slow at times, but if you aren't in a hurry with a grandpa bed time, then it just lets you enjoy the company and surroundings more. I should say the food service is slow, but they never let my beer remain empty.",

I ate the whole thing. I had to sit at a communal table which, actually, I didn't mind. Ended up chatting with a nice couple about food and other good restaurants in the valley to check out. The server we had was cheerful and nice. Quick service too. The beer selection is quite nice! This place is small, but divided into 2 dining areas... a bit odd, but it works. I think they use the patio between the two buildings as a beer garden in good weather. Can't wait for that!",

As a place to drink beer, this is probably a decent spot, but we were joining friends later for drinks so we only drank water with our meal.  The haus brat was nothing to write home about----it was surprisingly average at best.  When I grill a sausage at home it has much more flavor than what I got here.  And for the life of me I could not taste the \"Haus Bacon\" supposedly in the German Potato Salad.  It was pleasant outside for conversation until the live accordion player began----it wasn't his accordion that made it difficult to talk over, it was the loud amplified bass that he played with so he had to amplify too.  Did it ever occur to anyone that an unamplified solo accordion would be a nice background to conversation rather than a thumping bass which forces everyone to talk louder?  They have a customized ping pong table that look pretty cool.  If we ever come back it will be just to have a pint or two.  I'm not sure what is so \"artisanal\" about dry brats.",

We stopped in one day and spoke with an assitant manager who took all our information and assured us we would hear from the manager, Kevin E., later in the week.  Nope, that didn't happen.  I emailed Kevin.  I tried to call Kevin.  No response.  That is fine if you can't take our reservation and accomodate us, but let us know.

In the past I have had good experiences here but the past two times have been absolutely awful. It was with the same server as the time before, a tall skinny young man with long blonde hair tied up in a bun and rather large gauges in his ears, wearing pink sun glasses. Took forever to get our first round of drinks and then he never came back. We watched as he went to other tables and he just kept passing us by. We waved at him on his 4th or 5th pass and finally got his attention, we asked for two more drinks....they never came. The place wasn't busy, perhaps 3 or 4 tables split with other servers. We watched him make several more passes and again got his attention as we wanted to order food. He brought us menus and then never came back. We waited for an additional 30 to place a food order and then just decided to leave. On our way out I politely asked to close out and get made a comment of being sorry and that he was slammed, lol. He only had two other tables besides us, this is at 300 in the afternoon....it was a ghost town, not slammed by any stretch of the imagination. I really try to treat my customers to places I enjoy but I don't see myself going back any time soon. Used to be a great place to take customers.",

Peg and I went last night to sample some of his changes that were just introduced..they were awesome! A shrimp roll that was incredibly flavorful, not overdressed, and almost half the price of what a lobster roll (not usually satisfying because it isn't exactly pulled out of the nearest ocean in AZ) was a winner. The wedge salad was a great version, and the beet appetizer was terrific. I had the schnitzel (wonderfully crunchy crust, juicy pork) served with cabbage. I know that a burger will be in my future as Chef makes incredibly non-pedestrian burgers that are flavorful but not. overly complicated. We have enjoyed this place from the time of Payton Curry. So glad that this Chef has returned to the Valley!",

It's roughly the size of half of a little Debbie brownie snack and tastes like a poorly made protein bar. Thankfully the management agreed to take it off of the tab which we really appreciated and honestly was a determining factor in us coming back. But as a heads up; don't get the brownie. Everything else was amazing!",

This restaurant is actually in the top 10 list for \"Best French Fries\" in Phoenix and they have most definitely earned that position. The fries are served on a small sheet pan and parchment paper. This creates a serving style that facilitates sharing by opening up space so there is ample room for all the eager fingers to snatch up some fries all at the same time. With the fries comes multiple delectable sauces to choose from with the truffle sauce being my highest recommendation.",

Cons: expensive food even by Old Town standards.  $16 for an ala carte footlong brat that was skinny, overcooked and not juicy (well seasoned though).  Slow, disinterested server and what seemed like uncoordinated management.  Their patio is a good place to be on an 80 degree Saturday afternoon, so we'll try some other menu items and hope the servers are a bit more motivated and happy",

The reason why my girlfriends & I chose this spot was because it was around the corner from where we were staying. Now back to the not too busy....so much so the hostess was busy playing Jenga w/ a table of customers but she quickly noticed us and took us to our table. However what was uncomfortable was how she asked these 2 ladies who were already sitting at the table to get up & move because they had clearly not read the \"please wait to be seated\" sign at the hostess stand & so they just sat themselves at a table. Well my dear hostess maybe if you had been at your podium instead of playing Jenga the ladies would've never have sat themselves in the first place! Once we were seated we were handed menus and that was all. No \"can I get you a glass of water\" and maybe it's because there's a drought idk but it just wasn't the usual seating I'm used to. The hostess gave us our menus & went back to playing Jenga. 7 minutes passed by and no server. At this time I went to the Jenga table & asked if we had to walk to the bar to order food and drinks or what...hostess said she would go get the server. 5 minutes later the server walks up & tells us that they are so slammed and busy and apologizes for the wait. We order food and drinks. I order 3 different sliders which all turned out to be mediocre. The patty was practically burnt on my sliders, I didn't find anything special about them. My girlfriend had cheese curds which were ok. I only gave this place 2 stars because the beer was good.",

You'll for sure get the German vibe here just looking at the menu selection and beer choices.   This place is great for all types of people because I've been here with work friends, happy hours, brought my parents here and my wife recently did a surprise birthday lunch here with about 10 of my friends!   I don't have a favorite thing here yet but the pretzel is delicious and they have some really great sauces to go with some of their appetizers.  The place does get pretty packed during your typical peak hours but what good place doesn't in Old Town. I'm looking forward to trying the chef's new spin off Taco Haus. So that should tell you something, the place is successful enough that they are able to spin off a Mexican version of Brat Haus.   Oh and if you're looking for that Oktoberfest any time of the year, you can get das boot filled with your favorite beer. Auf Wiedersehen!",

Before we go any further, let me just say this: pretzels. Big, doughy, salty pretzels that come with several different kinds of mustard. Yessir. Yes, daddy. Yes, Aunt Ida's gimpy dog Dot. Pretzels. I ate my fair share, and several others' as well. Pretzels. And fundido cheese. YES.  As drinks go, they've got a massive spread of beer and the fella who taught the class knows more about beer than anyone I've met before. They don't do domestics (no Miller Lite here, kids) just interesting stuff.  I should also mention that as a non-drinker these guys totally get mad love from me for the extensive line of old school soda that they had on hand. Mad love. I would have been happy with a Sprite, but I got to order an old red cola. They also have their own sodas - ginger beer, cucumber mint, and a strawberry thyme something or other. Thanks!",

The chili had little flavor but the best itself was kinda  good except for skin a little tough and a bit bland. The fries were overcooked but the truffle aioli was amazing. The beer was outrageously high at $10 plus tax and tip ($13????) Which was brought in a mildly cool bottle and warm glass -- note they were out of a $7 bottle and offered this as a sub w/o telling $ difference. The final bill was outrageously high.

Brat Haus is unfortunately in that part of Old Town (right next door to Salty Senorita) where all the ASU kids come to drink on weekends. Anyway, we had some tasty food and Oktoberfest beers and a great time. My friend and I got the restaurant week special which came with 1 appetizer so of course we got the pretzel and cheese, my favorite. Then we also each got a bratwurst.. I think these were supposed to come with fries but our waiter was super swamped and forgot. Then we also got one each of the two desserts they offer. Bratwurst was delicious but nobody really liked the desserts much. This was not a bad deal at $30 for all that food. My hubby got the ribs plate and my friends hubby got the pig roast plate and those were $20 each which I don't think is that great of a deal. I think the brats are their best offering so it's usually a good idea to stick with that.  Really, the appeal of Brat Haus is their huge patio. When the weather is nice it can't be beat. It's a great place to come and enjoy a few beers... play some tetherball or jenga... whatever floats your boat. This month for Oktoberfest they even had an oompah band!",

They do also have a massive pretzel for larger groups, but I've yet to try it.  However, the reason to come here is the homemade brats which are spectacular.  My personal favorite is the spicy pepperjack.  Just the right amount of spice served on a hoagie bun with two toppings of your choice.  The fries are also pretty solid.  My only complaint about this place is the high prices.  $9 for a brat and $4 for fries is steep for lunch and throw a drink on top of that and you're nearing $20 with tip.",

I will never return as I've never actually been so disrespected in my whole life  In reply to Dave; You were clearly embarrassed you couldn't resolve the situation your staff put itself in, rightfully so, however you're trying to make it seem that waiting was our problem which is hilarious considering we were already seated. You and your establishment are a joke. You as the \"part owner\" clearly had an agenda and righting your wrongs was not priority, we didn't \"bypass\" anything we tried to bring business to your place by going to the bar where Adrianna sat us.  I'll review you in this fashion on every platform I can find. If you noticed I review lots of places, GOOD AND BAD  I average a 5 star review rate so you receiving ONE Star is nothing short of accurate",

    "text": "From all of the wonderful reviews of this place, I have to assume that we came in on a bad night, like when the cook had the night off and we were served food that was left over from 2013.......the pretzel was extremely stale and appeared to be previously frozen and from a box, like the pretzels in a discount department store that are \"baked\" in a rotating light-bulb oven for a few days :( The fries were seasoned nicely but were served to us ice-cold, and the few bites I managed of my Reuben sandwich were soggy and full of fatty grizzle (however, the manager noticed that we didn't eat it and didn't charge us for it....).  Her kind gesture, the great beer selection, and this quaint restaurant's potential were the only reasons I gave this place two stars.  Oh boy, what a disappointment.....hopefully better next time, if there ever  is a next time.....???",

Smoke free patio would be ideal.   Met a group of friends and random people for informal Happy Hour.   When we received the check, the server added a 20% gratuity. I questioned her why, as we were not at a table together but just met up to mingle.   She said its policy that all groups get automatic gratuity regardless if we're at the same table or even together.   There was about 20 random people that showed up in our social group. Many didn't know each other.   They only had one server for large area and many tables in addition to ours. Our server was friendly and did her best but she was overwhelmed and the service lacked.   They still charged us all 20% auto gratuity even though we weren't  at a table together, just mingling In a general area, and restaurant had one server for the entire area.   Definitely not a process that is customer service focused which forces gratuity but doesn't provide the service to justify.   So be aware if you're meeting people randomly for HH and check your bill as gratuity may be added.",

    "text": "My kids wanted to take me out for a Father's Day lunch on Saturday cause they know I love brats. I've been really wanting to come here. We came here on one of the hottest summer days and yet summer is just starting. Ouch.   Anyways, for lunch it was a little confusing cause their outdoor beer garden and hostess stand was empty. In between their garden or outdoor seating is two small Haus for indoor seating. We just picked one cause it was so hot outside.   We were greeted right away but it took a little while to get our menus and drink orders but that's okay. We weren't in a rush or anything.    So based on the Yelp reviews, I knew what we want to start off with. We started out with the pretzel and cheese. It was so good. Loved the pretzel and dipped in the warm beer cheese. So so dang good. Then we ordered the Brat Haus Poutine. Fries were nice and crispy with gravy and pieces of fried pork belly. That was so good and so big. It was way too much for the four of us but really good.   I ordered the BBQ Boar which had boar and bacon with shredded BBQ pork on top. When I got it, I was so overwhelmed. Didn't know how to attach it. Pick it up. Nope. Had to fork and knife it. It was okay. I think the BBQ overwhelmed the brat and took all the flavor away from the brat. The BBQ pork was okay and even through the shredded pork was soaked in BBQ sauce the porky was a little dry (if that makes sense at all). It was so much I was barely able to finish it.   My wife had the Umami which was basically ginger pork & chicken sausage on a bun. She got all the basic toppings on the side. It was too spicy for her so she switched with my daughter with the Haus brats. She liked that a lot better. My son got the BH chili dog and he thought it was okay.   So overall, the appetizers were great. Pretzel and Poutine were really good and I would recommend for sure. The brats were okay. Not great but good. The service was a little slow but everything slows downs on a really hot day (115 degrees) in Scottsdale. I liked it and would really like to try some of their other brats cause I'm a brats lover.",

I love a good currywurst but typically I can only get it in Germany so I was really happy to find that Brat Haus has one and it's fantastic. Not only are they dog-friendly but they even have a pup brat and our pup loved it! We will definitely be back to work our way through the menu. Brat Haus is a must-try.",

We brought family from out of town and sat down in time to grab up a couple happy hour specials (brat burger for $6 and the fried pickles for $4). They also have the HUGE pretzel for $15 (instead of $20) $1 off draft beers and some other deals.   We got a regular pretzel, fried pickles, falafel pita, lamb brat, salad and brat burger for 3 adults + 2 kids. It was the perfect amount of food, as our kids eat hardly nothing. Kid meals do exist for about $7/each.   The backyard patio area has bags, a chalkboard wall and a bunch of 2x4 Jenga blocks the kids loved playing with. We had a leisurely chat at our table as they ran around playing with other kids who congregated around the play area. Getting there early meant the place had families and happy hour specials, so that's definitely the only time I'd ever want to be there.  Overall, the food was good, but nothing majorly exciting to report except maybe the freebie honey mustard condiment we had on our table. It was less sweet and more spicy, just the way I like it. Otherwise, the rest was just sustenance. What really was awesome about the place, however, was the ambiance. We had a great time, but our kids had an even better time.",

Either do what you say you're going to do, stay open, or change your website to reflect you actual practices.  Update number 1 Less than 8 hours after I left my first review, I received a very nice message from the owner of the business. He agreed with what I said and changed the website and yelp to reflect their actual practices. He also offered to send me a gift card, going above and beyond.

    "text": "As we headed to this restaurant the tune from the '80s song \"Our House\" by Madness floated through my head but with the lyrics below:  Brat Haus... In the middle of 2nd St. Brat Haus...  (OK so it's actually south of 2nd St. on Scottsdale Rd. but my brain likes to take creative license on reality, especially when directions are involved).  Quite honestly Brat Haus wasn't our first choice. We were going to go to Rehab Burger but there was a 45 min to 1 hour wait to get a table. Whaaaat? On a Wednesday night? At 6 P.M.? Then I realized it was Spring Training time which made a lot more sense.   Anyways, Brat Haus, despite being our little silver medal of restaurants, ended up being a wonderful choice for dinner. There was no wait and we were seated quickly. We shared some appetizers and I ordered the Das Fire, their spiciest sausage on the menu, in sandwich form.  Our appetizers were a large portion and excellent. The pretzel ($6) was perfectly cooked with a well balanced beer-cheese dip. The poutine ($12) was a huge plate of fries soaked in thick brown gravy with battered and fried cheese curds and pork belly. Salty, fatty, starchy Canadian inspired goodness, eh?  My Das Fire sausage ($10) had a mixture of habanero, green chile, and jalapeno in it. Our server warned me it was spicy but I said I was up for the challenge! It was a medium-hot level of spiciness for me, almost spicy enough to make my nose run but not quite. I got it with the root beer onions ($1 extra) which were very potent and strong flavored against the savory, fiery flavor of the sausage. I appreciated the huge mound of onions with it, but I probably would have preferred a mix of root beer onion with another condiment to balance out the flavor a little more (Now I know for next time). The only slight negative for me was that the casing didn't have a good \"snap\" to it when I bit into it, so with some bites I really had to work my teeth into the sausage to tear off a chunk with the sandwich bread.  Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed.  While we ate inside today since it was getting chilly, I'd definitely like to come here again to dine at their dog friendly patio and perhaps order a special dog brat for my four legged friends.",

The hot pretzel appetizer was ok - rather tough, but the beer-cheese dip (with green onions?) was tasty.  I got the fire brat - supposed to be jalapeno, habanero and brat.  It was pretty mild, and...for a place called Brat Haus, not particularly special.  The sauerkraut was a little flat, and there was just too much bun on the sandwich...next time, maybe the brat plate so I can focus on the brat more.  The fries were pretty good (and curry ketchup was a nice touch - one of 6 condiment options, IIRC - ketchup, yellow mustard, curry ketchup, dijon mustard, whole grain mustard, and honey mustard).  Probably worth checking out again, but didn't live up to my expectation on the brat.",

Flying a drone around for a half an hour while we ate outside was borderline ridiculous. They were flying this noisy thing over our heads and taking video or photos of us/customers and the restaurant. It instantly made us want to leave and was a bit intrusive for my taste...",

That's where it ended. 4 entrees came out and the only one that was remotely edible was the \"dork\" burger (duck and pork). My wife's lamb sausage was burned to a crisp and the other two meals were just plain bad. Our waiter had vanished and a new server took his spot who was very pleasant. She did take the undesirable items off the check but I just could never go back. Serving a scorched black sausage is just plain inexcusable. At least 2 to 3 people should have seen it before it went out and they served it anyway which tells me they either were negligent or they saw it and didn't care. Either way that's a deal breaker for me.  The serving staff is the highlight of this place.",

    "text": "Update: this is nothing at all new to anyone who knows this place, but it bears repeating. The brats here are amazing. Just the right balance bwtween crunchy and al-dente, with the outer skin perfectly crisp. The flavor of the haus brat was amazing, with just the right amount of bite and spice.   How do you describe a flavor? You don't, you just say yum, and people know what you mean (see triple D or Andrew Zimmern's show on food network for proof). Yeah, so they ran out of ribs, so I got the haus brat. You can't go wrong. Simply come here and order any brat, and you'll be G2G.  You know what's an oft-overlooked aspect of German hotdogs? The bun. Simply an amazing tasting bun here. For proof, next time you order your dog, eat the sausage separetly from the bun. Trust me you won't  be disappointed!  The bar area is cool here. Might be my new go-to spot in Old Town when its not busy. This weekend there's apparently a bbq festival at Talking Stick, so I'm guessing that's why this normally packed spot on Friday nite 9pm is only half full. The barkeeps are real people and down to earth. We just uncorked a sour bottle of wine. It was sour on purpose. The buyer didn't like it, so the bartenderette (the one with the dutch cut) poured everyone shots of what little remained. It wasn't my cup of tea. But the hefeweisen I ordered - #7 not the grapefruit flavored #5 was pretty nice. Better than Pyramid. If that's a compliment.  Verdict: upon second inspection, this place has gone up a rung in my book.",

    "text": "I had two issues with this place: 1. Gluten 2. Service  I have a gluten allergy and Brat Haus has a ton of items on their menu marked gluten free, so I thought it would be a good place to go. I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate such an allergy and they said yes. When I got there, I informed the waitress of my allergy. Her disinterested response should have been my first sign, but I guess I didn't catch. I was sick before I left the restaurant.  So, here's the problems with their \"gluten free\" menu. First, fried items that are labelled gluten free on the menu share a fryer with non-gluten free items and as such are not gluten free. So, I feel their menu is inaccurate. But I asked that question beforehand and avoided the fried food. Second, since I must have caught some cross-contamination, it's clear that no accommodations were made. It's not hard: change your gloves and use a clean set of utensils. If Five Guys can make it work, Brat Haus should be able to (or if not, don't say you can and throw GF on half your menu items).  Here's the problem I had with service. Perhaps it's obvious by now, but I was not a fan of our server. Even outside of the gluten issue, she was bad. She just coiuldn't have cared less about serving us. But you get a bad server every now and again and I can typically overlook that. My real issue was that the manager completely blew me off when I told him that I had got sick from the gluten cross-contamination. He literally interacted with me for less than 5 seconds before walking away and the tiny response that he did give me was a complete blow off.  Really disappointing. Food seems pretty good otherwise.",

After asking where I'd like to sit, he pointed me to the bar when I replied inside.   It was a cloudy and slightly cold day so I figured inside was better than outside.  Once inside one of the bartenders greeted me and handed me a menu. I started off with brat sliders and ski, a lemon orange soda that reminded me of mountain dew, but less strong and drinkable.  The bar had a decent number of people in it originally, but not to full and slowly got busier as I sat there.   The brats were good, basically you get a 1/2 brat, and the beer selection was quite extensive.  I'm sensitive to hot food and the spicy brat was perfectly edible so I'd warn you it's not \"hot\" more spiced or flavorful.  I would call this an American Gastropub take on a German beer garden since it isn't the same (I've been to Munich).  However, it will make you happy if you want some Germanish food and beer.    I could tell the guys working the bar cared about the beer.  I overheard a few conversations where one talked about switching a tap/line because they had a cherry beer in there and it lingered a bit and they didn't want to have that ruin someones drink.  I also saw the bartender give the guys who were picking up beer orders some tests (friendly) where he'd give them a smell or taste and they would try to guess which beer was which.  Too bad I don't live nearby or I'd come back here.",

The courtyard is big and has cool games like tether ball, ping pong, giant jenga and more, plus lots of seating. However it is not dog-friendly (insert sad face)  And, oh, the BEER. If you are a beer fan, you will love this place. Awesome selection of authentic german beers and more. Definitely the best place in old town for GOOD beer, without a doubt.   Food is great too. I highly recommend their sliders. The brats are good as well, but I am not a brat connoisseur, so they all kind of taste the same to me (still good though). However, they put them on a great crusty roll and are accompanied by a selection of awesome, high-quality mustards. You get to select one topping to go on your brat as well, and I love the apricot chutney, if you are into the sweeter side of things.   Also, been meaning to try this: they have a menu item I believe is called \"The Whole Hog.\" Anywho, the idea is to get 20-ish of your closest friends together and order this item, as it is feeds large groups.  Sounds like fun. Anyone done it and enjoyed it?  Anyway, great place to hang out, play games, DRINK AWESOME BEER, and enjoy good food.  Yay Brat Haus!!!",

    "text": "Wait what???  4 stars for a brat??? Exactly! One has to question how they ended up with 4 stars...unless wait it was a bunch of their friends and family or something.   Let's start with the server...when you're cool versed in that much ink...cover up. That body covered in that much ink and that lack of clothing made us lose our appetites.   So let's see...brat ink forgot to take our drink orders. Not that it mattered because even after she got the order she forgot to get the drinks.   The pretzel is the worst burnt-like pretzel ever. I am having a hard time to come up with words to describe that nastiness. The cheese sauce was so bad they had to put chives in it to give it flavor.   The garlic fries had this amazing flavor of week old burnt deep-frier oil combined with this oil soaked chewiness and undercooked potatoes. It is amazing how a fry cook could mess up fries this bad.   The brats...which they are know for...seem like they were sitting out in the AZ sun for days. Where else can one bite into a juicy brat and get dried up ground pork or boar or dog instead.  Come to the Brat Haus for this one of a kind experience!!!!  Take it one level better...slap that lifeless brat into a gooey chewy oversize hoagie roll. Cover it in one of their toppings sans sauerkraut and keep looking for the spicy mustard at your local grocery store...not here because warm Dijon is your best choice.   Should have know better as soon as I saw falafel on the menu...das es nichts gut!!!! Aufiderzein!!!!",

I stopped by in the middle of the day on a weekday and sat at the bar in the \"bar\" building. Love the many brat selections (the name says it all) on the menu and a huge beer selection, very cool outdoor smoker that makes the whole space smell delicious.   The bartender was super friendly and helpful with drink suggestions. The daytime manager spent some time chatting with me and gave my several suggestions of places to see while I was visiting in town, as well as coffee spots for me to use for interviewing potential hires.   Can't wait to come back when I'm in town next!",

    "text": "So I've been here a few times now and I must say, I'm a fan of the menu additions! Brat Haus has also done a bit of renovating since I was last in and they managed to add about 10-12 seats inside the restaurant.  The best part of their new menu might be the poutine. Yes, hand cut fries with a pork gravy and cheese curds. Their poutine is just a tad different in that the gravy is LOADED with meat.  I shared it with a friend and I probably should've called it quits there.... but I didn't.  I forged on and had the duck brat with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. The spicy peppers are red bell peppers, pickled to be spicy. They are fabulous!  You'll feel your core temp rise after eating a few.  And the kraut is homemade, served fresh and crunchy, not overly briny... Meaning its actually good! I added their dijon mustard too ... whoa! It was a party in my mouth. FYI, they have about 5 mustards on the table, all of which are housemade and all are pretty darned good. Then, as if I hadn't stuffed myself already, we decided to share a butterscotch root beer float. The server suggested making the float \"adult style\" which meant we'd be adding root beer vodka to the mix!  It was difficult to share, but very yummy.  Service was good, not great, but not awful.  My beer was gone for about 6-7 minutes before she came around to check on my thirst.  It won't keep me away, I'll just be better about making sure I get a water at the beginning to tide me over any dry periods.",

Service was impeccable when we went, really attentive and helpful when we asked questions about top sellers.  It's easy to over-order, as everything sounds so enticing!  The soft pretzel is warm, toasty, soft and lightly chewy (the right kind of chew you'd want from a good pretzel).  Their sliders are nicely portioned and always juicy and tender.  Their brats are good; not too salty, savory, and flavorful.  My husband is a big fan of the Sean sandwich, which is quite filling!",

Clearly a spot where the impressive beer list supersedes the quality of the food our meal started off on the wrong foot when we were denied seating in the main dining room and placed in a smaller back bar area and although the bartender was pleasant enough while a great soundtrack played overhead it became quite obvious early on that our lack of enthusiasm for suds was unappreciated with food arriving slowly, often far from hot while water refills required direct inquiry.  Focusing on the food, a first round of appetizers proved to be fine, if not wowing - the pretzel nothing to write home about and the \"do you want cheese with that\" commanding an unannounced $3 up charge while the dates and pecorino were a nice sweet and savory pairing with quality ingredients well prepared.  Last and perhaps least, a basket of fries was ordered by my aunt and although I'm far from an expert I found them to be a bit undercooked; more starchy and less fluffy than I'd prefer.     Moving on to the meat of the menu (pun intended) aside from being luke warm and served on a decent roll I do not understand the reviews for the brats at Brat Haus and, as a matter of fact, with all the ridiculously hefty spices I'd defy anyone to differentiate on blind tasting the difference between pig, duck, or turkey on any of our selections - a lack of subtlety that led to my mother giving up after a few bites and even challenged myself on the duck brat as I felt like I was eating the smell of Penzey's Spices more than anything protein.  Faring better - as a matter of fact quite a bit better - my aunt's burger with a supple and smoky patty, fried egg, and sharp Swiss was the highlight of the savories; a case of \"Keep it Simple, Stupid\" if there ever was one.  For desserts - generally not a beer fan I actually liked what the rich chocolate stout did to temper the sweetness of the dates and the waffle that so many have raved was indeed a light at the end of the tunnel; a light, airy, and golden crisp disc with a bit of spice balanced by the sweet honey showing that the kitchen can indeed achieve balanced boldness when they try - or perhaps when they DON'T try and end up overthinking and overshooting their mark as they did with the sausages.",

That was all delicious, and even better with the special treatment as my small group and I enjoyed the fireplace in the back patio along with a fine game of Jenga, we were practically the only one's left by that time.

Firstly they have great, great fries, secondly their sausage plate is out of this world. It was so good I had to order two of them. The fries are just like Belgium fries, meaning excellent.   The first time I was here I had the boar brat, yes it was heavy, but it was very good.  I really like the ambiance and the service. Spencer did a great job.",

Felt like she may had too many tables but very disappointed in the service. Moved up to four stars due to a very nice apology from the manager. I'll be going back sooner that I thought.",

However the takeout food a little less The Belgian frites were waaay to greasy and really nothing like the ones in Belgium . The brat ( house one garnished with  red peppers and onions ) was just ok . Nothing to write home about .  I guess this might be a fun place to come for the atmosphere on weekends but food wise after spending over $20 I can't say I'll recommend it for the food",

In short I could have grilled a better brat, and I am not a grill man. My brat at Brat Haus was on the dry side and the grilled onions, although decent, was barely enough.  The fries I ordered was just okay as you can tell they were not fresh and had been sitting for awhile.  I wouldn't have mind the subpar food but at $15 it wasn't worth it. It's really too bad because on occasion I reeeally love a good brat. Although I am pretty harsh on the food, the positives are the wait staff, beer, and atmosphere.",

    "text": "My husband and I were looking forward to trying the new Braut Haus restaurant, and had an opportunity to try it this evening. Unfortunately, our experience was underwhelming and there were just enough annoying disappointments to prevent us from wanting to come back. While the location is still new--and we would've been understanding of the logistical challenges that come with newness, our disappointments lie in the overall decision-making of the management.  First- we were not prepared for the sticker shock on the brauts themselves ($14 each). The fries were also expensive, and so were the drinks. My husband and I each had a braut, and an iced tea, and we split a fries. The total came to just over $40. This is expensive.   I was also annoyed that they didn't have a soda fountain or free refills. I wanted a Diet Coke and it was $3 for a can. Laughable. I was also annoyed that they ask for a tip at the register where we ordered the food, and it's pre-populated with 20%. We are usually pretty decent tippers and chose to tip at 20%, but I do find it annoying when restaurants prompt their customers to tip before the service is provided. Additionally, the restaurant's model is that you order at the register and they deliver your food to the tables. When you finish, you take your glasses, plates, etc and deposit them into a dish bun before you leave. This left us wondering, again, what we were tipping for. The tables have silverware all laid out, and the only value-add provided by the staff is to bring the order to the table. We ended up paying $48 for two brauts, one order of fries, and two glasses of iced tea that we served ourselves. It felt expensive.   The braut itself was decent, but nothing to write home about. The fries were not crispy, and came out on the oily side. The curry ketchup was delicious, though.   My last bit of feedback is that we went around sunset and the glare from the sun was really uncomfortable. There was no shade to block the glare.   Overall, I hope the management re-evaluates their prices and business model. We are not opposed to spending good money for good food and a good experience, but I walked away feeling a little taken advantage of.",

Wings: wow these wings were tasty! For someone trying to watch their fat figure, it was nice to know these wings were grilled so it's a little healthier! The sauce on top was a great balance of sweet heat....a must try for any wing lover.  Sausage sampler: all three of the sausages were delicious! I don't remember the types they give you, but I liked them equally! The pickled vegetables that come with it are all paired great, but the pickled onions to me were the best! (Sauerkraut was a close second)   The beer selection was great, and the pricing for the menu was pretty descent! That along with the vibes (corn hole, outdoor seating, and live music) gives this place a 5/5 in my book!",

First it was kind of difficult to figure out how to get into the place they had an outdoor hostess stand that said dining room to the left bar to the right please wait to be seated but no one came up to us so we went into the dining room and were told they weren't serving food there we had to go sit in the bar. I ordered the fish and chips. My husband ordered a burger with a brat patty and an egg. He took one bite of the burger and sent it back.  He thought it was disgusting and there's only ever been one burger in his life that he hasn't liked. We both ended up with the fish and chips which was good but the fries were waaay over salted - and I like salt.   Took forever to get our check. The waitress was nice but the service was slow and she got a bit cold after we sent the burger back.  Disappointing $45 meal. Keep in mind that my husband is from Wisconsin and I've German heritage so he grew up on burgers and Brotz and has had many burger brought combos in his lifetime.  UPDATE:  In response to the owner's response. I don't know how to message you directly so I am posting it here. At no time did the Manager come over and speak to us.  The server took the burger away and brought him fish and chips and that was it.  And I do not see a credit on my card - I see another pending charge!",

I was so fortunate to win 5 tickets to Brat Haus' September 17th Oktoberfest event at the Yelp Pawfect Day Event at Paws Commons. Thank you, Hailey B.!. I rustled friends and went to the event. We got there at around 5 pm after doing a little shopping in Old Town Scottsdale. The shops there are super charming.  Tip: While some stations accepted credit card, doing Oktoberfest is much smoother with cash. We walked over to Walgreen's and got some Greenbacks. After reading up on the Brat Haus on Yelp, I decided to try the HEFEWEISSBIER which had a nice wheat flavor. Very drinkable!  I loved my grilled das brat, a footlong bratwurst served in a pretzel bun. It was amazing with their house dijon mustard and sauerkraut. I also enjoyed the gouda soft pretzel with beer cheese sauce. I wanted dessert but had absolutely no room left.  For entertainment, we enjoyed the fellow Oktoberfest revelers. We witnessed the brat eating contest and left around the Badass Beard Contest. We could barely see the contestants for the Lederhosen and Dirndl Contests. It was crowded and festive. Our servers were friendly and welcoming. We were lucky to purchase the last Das Brat. I have to think about coming in costume next year (free admission).",

    "text": "I definitely liked this place, and I will be back to try out the BIG PRETZEL for myself. I decided to get a brat instead of the pretzel this time, and I was slightly underwhelmed. Not sure if it was because I didn't get the right toppings but it wasn't anything special for me. It was a decent brat, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't go back for it. I also got the fries on the side and they were yummy, especially with the dipping sauces that come on the side. You get three dipping sauces with the large fries and then there's a ton of sauces at the table to add.   My mom got the pretzel that serves 1-2....not sure how two people would split it because it was the size of a normal pretzel. The taste of the pretzel was good but again the size was underwhelming. I am curious to see how big the large pretzel is that is supposed to serve 6-10 because for $20 I would hope it would be LARGE. I can't wait to go back and try it.   Another reason I didn't rate this 5 stars was because of the service. We sat in the bar area and it was so slow in there yet I had to go up to the bartender to ask him to help us. At the end of the meal he told us their systems were down, but that shouldn't have stopped you from taking our order and you know just being good at your service. Didn't really want to leave that much of a tip but me being a prior server I still left him 20%.",

I was in search of a sour beer and there was a selection to choose from.  Had the pretzel and haus pate.  Big thumbs up to the pretzel but would probably stay away from the pate on the next trip.  It was just OK.  The pretzel was outstanding and the accompanying mustards were varied and flavorful.  Nice people.  Chill vibe.",

The French fries so good and the dipping sauces, especially the truffle aioli was to die for. Even if you usually don't like sauerkraut, this is really homemade like my grandmother's! The fact that the sausages come on baguette just like in Europe, is a great touch. The many beers on tap rock! And for dessert... Oh where do I start? The date cake, even though I don't like dates, was fantastic!!! And then then NUTELLA shake.... Oh good lord, amazing!!! The Butterscotch root beer float was so good it has changed my world!!! Looking forward to the weather getting better so we can sit out on their big patio. ....and to all the people that didn't like this place... And no offense, You don't know what you are talking about!",

    "text": "Ate here last night and was very impressed with the set up. Beer selection was excellent (liked that they use the proper glasses for each tap selection). Food was above average. Pretzels were well done and my sweet brat came with a tasty chutny sauce on top. The roll had a fresh, soft consistency to it. That's not easy to do in AZ thanks to our hard water. And it really feels like an old German beer hall. The decor inside was appropriately done. I'm looking forward to cooler days where we can sit outside in the biergarten. My only beef is that a lot of items are overpriced. I understand it's located in the midst of Scottsdale. And they make the effort to offer freshly made items on site (as far as I could tell). But I used to frequent several of these types of restaurants in other cities and they were not this expensive. The brat wasn't so mind-blowing that I'd step it up and order a specialty one that's $8+. If they were bigger, maybe. A lot of the beers are a buck or two higher than they should be as well. Especially the Belgians. Compared to other places. I hope the Brat Haus is here to stay. I'll recommend it to everyone. It's not your typical Scottsdale eatery which is a good thing.",

I was beyond disappointed and will not be back.  The beer bratwurst was dry and pretty tasteless, it must have been grilling for hours.  The onions on the brat were cold and soggy and so they made the bread soggy.  Each brat was served on a length cut from a loaf of French bread.  Where are the brotchens?  The fries were tasty but no German mayonaise listed in the dipping sauces.  Every brat stand in Germany serves mayonaise on their fries.  The only thing we found that was pleasant was the price, but the low price does not make up for the poor quality of the food.",

    "text": "This place has a lot of positives, however the service was unfortunately an overwhelming negative and the main reason for my 2 star review. I visited yesterday after the downpour and upon arrival the place was fairly busy, but nothing crazy. The Amy Winehouse hostess with a big bun on her head asked how many and we told her three. She said it would be a minute and asked us to have a seat. Twenty seconds later she turned around, clearly not recognizing my friend and I, and asked if we were waiting for a table for two.  \"Uh, no three,\" I replied. We were seated at a long table which was a little awkward because there was another group next to us at the same table but hey, at least we were seated. Our waitress greeted us, and was very friendly. She took our order and we did not hear from her again for ten minutes, when she came over to inform me they were tapped out of the beer I ordered. I quickly made another choice and then we waited another three minutes or so for the drinks to be brought out. Another five minutes later our baked pretzel came out and it was very good. It came with a honey, Dijon, and stone ground mustard, all of which were very good. Our waitress then came back to take our main order. I ordered the Pig Mac, my friends got a spicy brat, and I can't remember the other. At this point we were informed that fries (and everything) is Ala cart (LAME!) so we ordered a large fry to split. The food took about ten or fifteen minutes and during that time we had to flag our waitress down twice to ask for more drinks. The food however was a bright spot for all of us. Although I did not try my friends food they both agreed it was really good. I can say that I will definitely get the Pig Mac again as it was super tasty! Next, BEWARE THE ICE BIN! During our meal we were seated close to the serving station where there is an ice bin. The staff slammed the top of that thing down every 15-30 seconds and it is loud, so loud we jumped nearly every time they slammed it shut (Yes that loud!). So to sum up, food good, service bad. Hopefully they will get a groove going when the restaurant has been around a little while as this was their first week. However if I go back and the service is still as poor, I will not be returning. Oh and lastly, on our way out, another hostess story! As we were leaving the hostess said good bye. That was nice. However as we looked to our right we noticed the take out part of the restaurant sold brats so we turned around to take a look. When we turned around to walk back in the hostess that just said good bye to us, asked if we wanted a table. You can't make this stuff up!",

    "text": "My fourth trip to the Brat  Haus, this time with my teenage son, was another hit. This place has something for everyone: a killer beer selection, gourmet pub eats and a unique atmosphere. Let's start with the beer selection which features authentic German, Belgian and US microbrews on tap and a host of hard to find bottles. Each beer come with the correct glass. For example, I ordered a Zwick'l kellerweis and the delicious malty brew was served in authentic half liter ceramic stein. It is rare to find a bar which pays so much attention to the proper glassware, and it greatly enhances the experience. We sampled a top notch soft pretzel, excellent fries and out of this world brats with all the fixings. My son had a duck and date brat which had a wonderful smokey flavor while I enjoyed a beer brat which was a juicy treat. The patio which is situated between three small buildings evokes a European cafe atmosphere. The staff is attentive and well versed on the beer and food items. The owner even came by to check on our visit. This is a family friendly place which serves specialty sodas and even has waffles. A trip to the Brat Haus is like taking a trip to the Old World and never leaving Scottsdale!",

The game was slow but the people and staff were fun and charming. Certainly a place we will be visiting again and again.  Only drawback is the size of the bar area - a little cramped.",

Our service was good even thou the fries arrived a few minutes after our food.

My friends and I stopped in on Saturday afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner and a couple of beers. We were so impressed with everything about this place - from the service, to the menu, to the tap lineup and the ambiance. It really is an amazing place. They had happy hour on a Saturday from 3-5pm so we were lucky enough to be able to partake in those deals ordered the hummus and the pretzel and cheese to munch on along with our first round of drafts. I love that they have the matching glass for every beer they have on tap, really cool added touch.   For the main course since it was my first time, I went with the brat flight so I could try several kinds of brats plus I added in the beer pairings to match up. It was only $13 bucks and I highly recommend it. Oh and my friends ordered the garlic fries with all 3 kinds of dipping sauces. Those were awesome too. After all that, the place was cheap too! Love this place, I wish I lived closer so that I could join their Mug Club and really become a regular. Check them out, you're gonna be happy you did :)",

My issues are: very little seating in \"cool bar area\", and the fact that people, who I think were owners, kept setting things on the counter where I was sitting. Some lady was yelling on the phone next to us in the dining area (sigh) for most of our stay. My food was forgotten in the kitchen, we got wings. They are made with siriachi and actually were very good for being barely warm. We got a bacon blue cheese dressing with them that was excellent. Worth coming back for was watching one amazing man make like a million drinks at full speed with no flaws. And he tastes them all, the sanitary way (don't worry) so that you will be sure o get a great drink. He helped us pick beers that we liked, and he was spot on. I would go every night to watch him. Seriously. Give that man a raise!!!",

I enjoyed the fact that there are a couple different outbuildings that Brat Haus is divided into, and the bar was fun, if not a bit too cozy.  The food was excellent. I was particularly impressed with their aioli dips for their Belgian fries. The truffle aioli was amazing, as was the Sriracha aioli. I ordered the Rattlesnake Ripper and a hearth-baked pretzel. The sausage was incredible; not too gamy but it was obvious that it was rattlesnake. The apricot chutney was equally delicious. What got me was the pickles. Normally, I loathe pickles, but I found myself wanting more of their house-made product. The servers were obviously busy, and I cannot fault them for that on their second day of business, but it seemed as though receiving the food took quite a bit longer than normal; there were many tables without food when I arrived.  I sincerely hope this establishment does well, as I intend to be back. I imagine after a few weeks the kinks will be ironed out and things will run much more smoothly.",

Loved the atmosphere, loved the beer and LOVED the food. The sausages were served on really tasty rolls, not too bready or hard to eat. A selection of tempting condiments were provided. The curry catsup was out of this world.  I personally had the lamb sausage with apricot chutney, and it was truly stellar. My partner had schnitzel sliders. A little dry, but really tasty. The Belgian fries were also a treat.  We'll definitely come back here when we're in Scottsdale again.",

Literally walked up, ordered food, and was eating within minutes. The beer was flowing if you're into that kind of thing.   The environment is very Euro-beer-garden-outdoor-awesomeness. Who knew that this place was here?! I didn't ... but now I do for sure. Family friendly is always a plus too.  Thank you to Brat Haus for your preparation and execution, I'm looking forward to the next pre-game party as well as visiting for a non-soccer-related meal.  Excellent pretzels Gigantic beer steins Tasty Belgian-style fries Many things to dip said fries and pretzels in Burgers and brats aren't my thing, but other said they were tasty  I didn't ask if I could and where I would order off the menu but I'm sure that's possible as well.  5 stars if the next visit is as good as the first!",

    "text": "The beer is great, and the atmosphere is awesome! Now, for the complaints...my pretzel tasted microwaved...a bit soggy, not enough alternative healthy meat options, a movie playing on a Sunday with kids in the restaurant without warning with more F bombs than most truck drivers use in a lifetime...lastly and my biggest complaint...I appreciate the vegan option, albeit not that great in taste, that comes on a non vegan bun! Big oversight and a big fail!! They originally had the vegan option in a sausage form, but it was like an elongated falafel ball...now it is in patty form which was not an improvement, just a change in shape.   If I am correct in assuming that this concept was based on the Wurstkuche in Venice Beach, I suggest they take cues from their menu and offer more variety...and vegan items that are actually vegan!  Want to like this place more...being of German descent...but there are too many holes!!",

The ambiance makes this place either a cozy intimate affair or a fun group gathering. The main seating area is an outdoor pbackyard patio.  If you don't have your own entertainment you can choose from some awesome games of ping pong, teatherball , or try your had at life sized Jenga, it was amazing.   The food and beer were equal to the service received.  I enjoyed the spicy brat with some spicy peppers and probably to most delicious sauerkraut I've ever tasted.  All complimented with a flavorful and smooth German Amber beer.  If you haven't checked out this place before I recommend experiencing it for yourself.  This place would be great to host company parties.",

I wandered into Brat House and was greeted by the sweetest server. I think her name was Anya? (sorry if I got that wrong but I'm pretty sure that's her name). I've always been really indecisive and she had so much patience with me while I decided what to order. She even suggested a couple of her favorites. I ended up getting a schnitzel and it was BOMB. I went back twice that week and even brought friends because it was that dope. We had a blast. Thank you Brat Haus! Good food, clean atmosphere and IMPECCABLE customer service.",

Imagine a place with everything house-made including the ketchup and mustards! The Belgian Fries were super, they could have been served a little fresher but as a whole they were really solid. We tried two of the brats, the bread they serve them on was some of best bread I have ever had. It kicked everything up a notch! Our server was young and did a good job. She also offered up a good spot for us to continue exploring the town when we finished our drinks and lunch.",

    "text": "I went back to Brat Haus today for their Oktoberfest celebration. The place was packed, and it was great to see a local restaurant be doing so well after opening fairly recently.   I was pleased to see some improvements to the food--it seems like the brats fill up most of the bun now compared to what I've seen in the past, and I also think it was a great idea to convert the vegan brat to a burger, since the mashed consistency lends itself better to a burger than a brat.   The music was also slightly better than the last time I went--there was nothing that made me do a double take too badly other than some bad, Nickelback-y type of rock.  The service was a little slow but forgiveable considering the crowd. I'd love to go back again soon!",

I didn't try the chicken and waffles since my plate was full and I didn't want to take food I wouldn't  be able finish.  I left stuffed full of great food.    The date-cake was mind blowing.  I am not the biggest fan of dates, but this cake completely caught me off guard.  They have a very nice outdoor seating area, there was a fire going and a giant sized Jenga. They also have cornhole outside. A great place to go if you want to get out.",

They also have ping pong, corn hole, and giant Jenga, which is a nice touch.  My boyfriend and I went there for happy hour which had certain apps for $2 off and pints for $2 off. I appreciate that they had some beers on Nitros which gives you the smooth taste of the beer without the carbonated effect. I got the Four Peaks Brewing Co. Oatmeal Stout, which was my bf's favorite of the 4-beer flight he got too.   For food, we got pretzels with cheese dip ($4 during HH), Sriracha butter wings ($5), and shared an order of small Belgian fries with truffle aioli and Moroccan lamb brat with apricot chutney. Everything was delicious, loved that nothing was oily or too salty. The aioli that came with the fries had just the right amount of truffle flavor. The brat was probably the best brat we've ever had and paired nicely with the apricot chutney.  They were definitely busy as it was a Friday afternoon when we went and they were catering to a large wedding rehearsal party, yet they still had the ability to be attentive to us :)  Highly recommend this fun beer house for happy hour!",

    "text": "At the Brat Haus, I like their beer more than their food.  They have a great selection of beers and some nice German options, too.  The food, however, is either average or subpar.  First, I wanted to order a variety of their sliders, but was told that I had to choose one variation.  Why?  They give you four sliders, so just charge me $10 or whatever and let me select a combination of BLT, beef, and green chile chicken!  Bastards...  Since my first request was denied, I decided to order The Pig Mac with bacon and an egg.  The Pig Mac is a double cheeseburger with a pork sausage patty, a ground beef patty and the usual filler.  It was enormous, messy, and a chore to eat.  Even after squishing it down, I still couldn't fit my mouth around this thing.  I was forced to chop it up into smaller pieces and then had to daintily eat around the pink or undercooked parts of the pork patty.  I didn't get sick afterwards, so I guess I will survive, but I really, really, REALLY hate eating pink meat.  It would have been nice if they allowed their customers the ability of choosing how they want their meat cooked.  Brat Haus had just cooked a pig, so a couple people in my party decided to try that.  It didn't look very good and one guy even stopped eating it.    This guy requested some crispy skin and about 15-20 minutes later they brought out some \"chicharrones.\"  I have never tried this stuff and I am glad I haven't, because I wouldn't have any teeth left.  I took a little bite and nearly chipped a tooth...and it tasted awful.  Blech.  Who eats this stuff?  Really the only thing that they did well was the beer and a nutella milkshake that I ordered.  Please God don't have my friends take me to this place again...",

This most recent visit was a Sunday lunch on the patio, and even though the food took 40min to arrive, it was so good, any minor irritation or impatience was swiftly forgotten. I ordered the beet salad, comprised of roasted beets, citrus segments, pistachios, and local goat cheese in a delicious vinaigrette. It was light but satisfying, a great mix of textures and flavors. The Belgian fries are always incredible--we always get the large cone with a side of truffle mayo and hush hush sauce(a tangy, creamy sauce, kind of like 1000 Island, but better). Hubby got the venison chorizo brat, which was topped with caramelized onions and pickled carrots--I kept reaching over to steal those veggies off of his plate lol! Bonus: the beer list is great--a perfect mix of authentic German biers, local brews, and a few other good ones(I had Ballast Point Aloha Sculpin with my salad). BratHaus is an unpretentious, laid back, flat out FUN place to eat, for the whole family.",

The pretzel is one of my favs. I usually don't use the cheese that comes with it because they have so many mustards! The brats are also a must have. I haven't had one I didn't like, the sample platter is great to share then you can try a couple varieties.

Service was great, we appreciated the waitress' urgency in getting our app and beer ordered just minutes before HH ended. The one draw back was our burnt pretzel..I was absolutely starving so I was still able to eat it but it was just not the best. A bit of a disappointment since we were eating at a German spot but didn't make or break our experience. Brats are huge to the point you don't even need to order a side. The sauerkraut is to-die-for, much more fresh and crispy than your typical store-bought canned variety! Yummy curry ketchup available at each table.   Their beer garden is a wonderful spot for casual brews - bistro lights adorn the trees and there is ample seating that can accommodate parties both large and small.   This is my spot go-to PHX spot when I need to  fulfill my German cravings..Can't wait to return!",

Other minor but cumulative things included our waitress describing the charcuterie board as weird meats when we inquired about the menu item, and wait staff conversations about being understaffed can be heard very easily from the guest bathrooms.  You have the food and beer on lock down. Train your staff on table talk and avoid personal conversations at the server station.",

The beer selection is one of the best in old town and keeps to the True form with the German selection.  The beer garden is great for your lil ones and four legged children.  The brats and pig Mac are one of a kind in Arizona and keeps you coming back for the selection.  The Belgian Fries are to die for and mixed well with the selection of different sauces but management has decided to 86 them and replace with steak fries.  The new fries take away from the deliciousness of the different sauces especially the truffle aioli. If they bring back the old fries then this would be 5 stars!",

    "text": "For starters, a kitschy spelling doesn't make you a German restaurant, and to be fair, I don't think that's what the owners had intended, so I think those that would judge this restaurant's German authenticity are a little off the mark. With that said, what I'm about to say may make a lot of fanboys and girls very upset, as I understand that Chef Curry is a star in the valley, and I've been to a few of his past endeavors and quite agree that the mans talents are undeniable...but for me and my party, Brat Haus seemed to have everything down except for the food.   The decor is a very cool blend of modernist artsy, and industrial minimalist. Very cool. The service might have been a stretched a little thin, like one reviewer also mentioned, we were sitting at one of the few tables inside, when most of the servers tables were presumably outside, and we felt a little bit like we were at the \"kids\" table during thanksgiving dinner...a little slapdash \"heres your order and your check, thanks for coming.\"   First, the good. There is no shame in the beer list. No shame, Weihenstephaner Hefe, yes please...anytime I can. La Fin du Monde from Unibrou? absolutely...and these are probably two of the most commercial beers out of their selection, so if you've never heard of them, you can imagine what kind of paradise lies waiting for the average beer geek. Just wish those beers had gotten to us a little sooner, and that we might have been asked if we wanted another round. Again, when your at the kids table, just a sip of thanksgiving wine is all you can hope for.  If we could rate the place on their beer and fries alone, this would be a whole different review. Belgian Fries, truffle aoli...they honestly couldn't have been more perfect.  But it should be about the brats, yes? Partly on our failure, we went straight to the out of the box gourmet section. We had the rattlesnake rippers (rattlesnake sausage) , and the duck duck dates (Date and duck sausage), our logic being we can make beer brats at home, (Damn good ones mind you, if I don't say so myself. but, I guess I just did.), point being we decided to forego the mundane and see what an accomplished Chef known for his skill with cured meats could whip up instead. This was in retrospect a mistake. Both the rattlesnake and the duck at the end of it all, had us craving some good ole beer brats instead.  We found these two dogs, uninspired and not nearly as exciting as the quirky names or exotic meats might suggest. The rattlesnake. tasting like dry chicken, was insufficiently seasoned, moist less, and awkwardly skinny in a consequently overwhelmingly sized bun. We could  taste neither duck nor dates, in the Duck, Duck Dates sausage, and we had already polished off the fries before the stark realization set in that these dogs were not going to get even close to filling us up. Sharing our disappointments with each other, our party tried to place our proverbial fingers on the source of our ennui, and realized that everything was under seasoned, and we had failed in choosing the appropriate toppings for our peculiar dogs. (You have to pick one before they arrive) We chose pickled red onions, and spicy peppers. We agreed that given the Chefs history, we would have liked to see more of an active hand in his condiment pairings, rather than see a short list of condiments to choose from, i.e....we recommend apricot onion chutney with the duck and date sausage, or better yet, not even a suggestion, but more of an insistence, showing the confidence to say, we know how this rattlesnake shows its best and thus have served it with this fill in the blank accouterment. Left to our own devices and not having known that we wouldn't have classic dog garnishment, i.e...ketchup, mustard, relish...we were left there with our skinny, dry, under seasoned wieners, some sad not so spicy peppers, which helped a little with flavor but not with the dryness...and nothing else.   Dessert was the Drunken Date Cake, which was so blase, it had us all hunger games dueling for the measly scoop of vanilla ice-cream melting at its side.  Total: 2 dogs, 2 beers, some fries, and one dessert: $43   Yelp rating system classifies 2 stars  as \"meh, Ive had better\" and really thats the best way to describe this experience. If you decide to check out brat haus, my advice is to skip the fancy for now, go straight for the classic, and enjoy some great beers. We however, chose not to take the chance on ordering more, and decided to go and get something to eat. Not something you necessarily want to have to think about as you're leaving a restaurant with $43 bucks less in your pockets, but the truth nonetheless.",

We started with a hot pretzel which was tasty as well.  Great selection of beer, and we loved the outdoor ambiance.  Even though we were sitting outside on a chilly January evening (due to a ridiculously large party indoors... the only minus of the night), their many heat lamps kept us warm.  Will definitely be back.  Such a nice change of pace from the typical douchebaggy establishments of Scottsdale.",

They also have a great beer selection. Lots of taps and bottles, and they usually have something unique or hard to find. Last time I was there they had one of my favorites, Firestone Double Jack.  Also their apps are great! The wings are really good and they might have the best pretzels with cheese I've ever had at a bar.  The reason they don't get more stars is I have not really enjoyed much of their actual entrees. I've tried some burgers and brats and nothing was that special that would make me want to eat a meal there.  Overall a great place to meet with friends, grab beers and pretzels and then play some games! Just not a place I would want to eat a full meal at again.",

Especially with the Truffle & Sriracha sauces on the side.  They do get a bit overwhelmed with the massive amounts of people. My friends had ordered some garlic fries as well and 1 person didn't get garlic on theirs and both orders where cold from sitting for a long while before being served, but we were there on a busy night so it was understandable.  if you like low-key places with outdoor seating and awesome food/beer, I highly recommend Brat Haus to any foodie or beer enthusiast.",

    "text": "I love the Brat Haus! Lets just say I'm not what you would call a brat fan but this place changed me for the better! They use all fresh, natural hormone free ingredients, which makes me feel better about putting it in my body! If you've never been in before I recommend trying a brat. My favorites are the spicy brat with grilled onions or just the simple route with sauerkraut, the chorizo brat topped with the fabulous root beer onions (marinated in root beer) and the Moroccan Lamb brat with apricot onion chutney and spicy bell peppers. They just added a spicy pepper jack brat which is also fabulous! They have tons of brats to choose from besides my favorites I listed above including... a sweet brat, house brat, southwest chicken (spicy!!) a rabbit and hops brat, duck and dates, they even have a rattlesnake brat, and a veil brat. All the brats are made in house and are fresh as can be! The meat for both the brats and burgers come from Niman Ranch which means all the animals were vegetarian fed, antibiotic/hormone free and pastor raised... This can only mean that the meat you are ingesting is of the highest quality possible!   Be sure to start with a pretzel and cheese! They are DELICIOUS and the cheese dip is a three cheese beer dip that u can also top your amazing Belgian fries with but don't forget the bacon. The Belgian fries are to die for (they also have awesome garlic fries)  the fries come with your choice of dipping sauce and they have a ton to choose from... Ranch, chipotle aioli, truffle aioli, thousand island (hush hush sauce)  sriracha aioli and Blue cheese bacon. Okay I hate blue cheese but this blue cheese bacon dipping sauce is AMAZING!!! A must try! So not only do they have awesome dipping sauces for your fries but they also have a variety of mustards to choose from! They have the simple traditional catsup and mustard but they also have a whole grain, Dijon, honey mustard and curry ketchup. Try them all!  Some other note worthy menu options are- The schnitzel, crispy ribs, local tomato salad (add bacon!) and the charcuterie options!   Try and save room for the amazing date cake made with oatmeal stout and root beer (its soooooooo good!) you also can't go wrong with the butterscotch root beer float!   OHH and did I mention they have 28 beers on tap and tons of bottles to choose from? They also have an awesome happy hour!   **side note this is NOT a German food restaurant... But they do celebrate Octoberfest and its a pretty epic party!",

Lets start with Beer Selection: Yes. One of the best selections Ive seen and they have Hard Apple Cider. Reasonably priced beer and served frosty and amazing.  The burgers were good, but son, you came to Brat Haus for a reason...ORDER THE BRATWURST. You will absolutely not regret it. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. (Yes I see you giggling over there, QUIT BEING DIRTY).  But by far...the best for last...the pretzels and cheese. Oh. My. God.  I would like to order a dozen pretzels and a gallon of cheese sauce to be delivered to my house once a day thank you very much! I can't even begin to explain how amazing this is, I will go out of my way to come here just to have this. I like pretzels and cheese don't get me wrong but if you think this is some wetzels pretzels mall tasting concoction...you are mistaken...it makes them taste like cardboard.   Bring your friends, have a great time, drink some beer and nosh on the killer pretzels and cheese dip. You'll be glad you did!",

I was hoping it was a bockwurst - a white veal sausage that I've never been able to find in Arizona. I ordered it and it's not a bockwurst - still very good, but not a bockwurst.  I had the pretzels and they were fantastic.  I also ordered a vanilla shake. I like thick shakes so I was excited when it came out with a wide straw. Unfortunately it wasn't as thick as it looked, but still good.",

My boyfriend was a HUGE fan of the beers--great selection and so many varieties and sizes to choose from.  The food was incredible!!  We started out with the Fundido--the pretzel was so delicious and dipping it in the beer cheese was the perfect compliment.  My boyfriend had the Haus Brat and tried it with the house-made mustards--simply delicious.  I had the Vegan burger, and I have to say it was one of the best vegan burgers I have ever had for a place that is centered around the Pig and all its forms.  So utterly perfect and delicious and everyone that sampled it at the table agreed the flavors were amazing!  We had a basket of fries to share with the dipping sauces.  So scrumptious.  This place is a must-try and a must-revisit!  We didn't get to sit out on the patio because it was reserved but it looked like a great place to hang out with friends--especially with the great Phoenix weather!    The service was spectacular.  The waiter was super-knowledgeable about all of the beers and offered suggestions when my boyfriend was looking for specific types, etc.  He was also great with being honest about suggestions for food on the menu--I really appreciate the honesty from waiters at restaurants.  He was amazing and our entire experience there was amazing.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in AZ and I will definitely recommend it to friends!!",

And the beer cheese... one day I will learn how make something that tastes as good at home. And then have to start running weekly marathons.  The beer selection is great. There is plenty on tap and the prices are pretty reasonable. Where else can you get a German Oktoberfest on tap in March?  Pretty much everything is made on site. The pretzels, the brats, even the sauerkraut is made here and from local ingredients. If you end up sampling a lot, the price can get high fast but if you just come in for a brat it can be a reasonable lunch.",

It was also rather tough, not at all right. For $16 a plate I was pretty bummed by the end of the meal. For a better attempt at German good in the valley check out Haus Murphys in Glendale.

One side is clearly \"the bar\" and the other side is more geared toward those (like us) who come with kids!   There was an outstanding selection of beers from all shapes, sizes, and thicknesses. There was also an outstanding selection of uniquely flavored soda pops for the kids too! We enjoyed pretzels fundido and the Belgian fries for appetizer. Although the pretzels were a bit overdone and fundido was a bit blah, the Belgian fries were DELISH and plentiful. The dipping sauces were excellent and more than made up for the lack-luster pretzel appetizer.  I enjoyed the Spicy Brat with the Apricot chutney and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. My son and his friend enjoyed standard beer brats with mustard and saurkraut. They LOVED them. My husband enjoyed the specialty pork brat and was very pleased with it as well.   I'm looking forward to going back for a grown-ups night out there soon as I'm sure it's way more fun for the adults though I am happy that it was kid-friendly as well! Well worth the 40 minute drive from our house and looking forward to going back soon!",

    "text": "We dropped in for lunch about a week ago with some pretty high expectations. On first sight it was a great spot and it was exceptional to see that the parking spots in the center of the compound gone and replaced with tables. The tables did seem a bit sparce and I imagine they will add more as outdoor volume dictates. The new mural was very cool, but the guy who painted it must have been stoned, in a good way though. The place was busy mid week for a late lunch and that was a great sign that all was going well with this new concept, because so many of downtown restaurants would have been empty this time of day. Greetings were friendly as expected, but service was just a tad off, probably just because they are still new, I imagine and expect it to get better with some time. On to the food, The brats- SUBLIME!!!! amazing and I was sad I could only eat one. The Pretzle was abosolutly the very BEST I have ever had anywhere. this is a great start to something great.  What I didnt like was you had to choose add ons like toppings and sauces and that could add up fast if you feel ike sampling. Thats also where the missteps started to happen, The root beer onions must have been from the bottom of the batch cause they were way to soft, reminded me of the texture of over cooked angel hair pasta. The Hush Hush Sauce was SO SO and the Siracha Aioili was just thin and flavorless. The fries were just ok so the sauces didnt save them. The small smattering of pickled veggies just seemed chintzie and a little on the soft side. Will I be back to the Brat Haus... You Bet!!! This place has so much potential, and I cant wait to grab a table on the patio and drink beer, lots of beer, and wash the beer down with brats and pretzles. I also hope my negetive food observations change as I expect they will.  You need to give this place a try, It's a great new addition to Old Town!!!",

    "text": "I will warn right off, I may be slightly biased in my opinion of this place, because of my incredibly pleasant first visit here. Is that such a bad thing though?  When I first arrived and seated myself at the bar, I was surprised to find that there were 3 people seated at the bar who I knew. Then lo and behold, I knew the bartender as well! Naturally, this resulted in a rather warm greeting and an instant level of comfort.  Next up was to get a good look at the beer list, which I had already heard many positive things about, despite this place only having been open for a couple of weeks. I must admit, their selection is rather impressive; unfortunately, it is Scottsdale prices. This means that each beer has been marked up a few dollars extra on top of your typical bar prices. It's not enough to steer me away from the place, but enough to elicit a bit of a cringe when the bill arrives. I ended up having a couple of very delicious German and Belgian beers, a couple of which I had (amazingly) never had before.  Finally, the thing that thie place is named and known for: their bratwurst. I was a little unsure what all they could do with bratwurst to make an entire restaurant concept out of it. Well let me tell you, they pulled it off brilliantly. I had a DUCK bratwurst and I was not in the least disappointed. A friend of mine also had a \"rabbit & hops\" bratwurst which he claimed was tasty. At some point I want to go back and give the rattlesnake bratwurst a shot. That selection is certainly enough to keep the curious coming back! I just need to save up a few dollars to cover the cost of the beers...",

We had a great lunch and our server was very knowledgeable about the beer selection and what kinds of beers would pair well with what brats. She also recommended the pretzel with cheese which was amazing. Who doesn't love a good soft pretzel?  Gluten haters, for shame!!  My second experience there was for our corporate event. We reserved the patio which is such a great area. They have giant jenga, ping pong, and darts, as well as large overhead heaters and big benches which were very conducive to our guests mingling and moving and having a great time. Kevin, the manager, was awesome and on top of everything. He made sure our party was well staffed with servers, busers, and food runners. He also made sure that the appetizers came out in waves so as our guests were showing up there were always enough munchies. Once everyone arrived our servers started taking orders from our set menu and as people decided they were ready to eat the servers were always prepared to take their dinner order. Once again dinner came out in waves and it was perfect. Everyone mingled, ate, and drank at their leisure. I could not have picked a more perfect and well prepared place for our event. I will definitely be going back there and recommend we do more events at the Brat Haus.",

They let us have a taste of a new brew on a slow Fri. afternoon at happy hour. HH got you a good choice of beers for $3 and $4, plus we had a card for a free pretzel and I loved it. No need for the cheese sauce ($3) with all the excellent mustards they serve. And I thought the spicy brat w/ root beer onions was great. Not dry at all, I liked the roll too which lots of people seem to quibble with. Maybe being in the hot sun and having a couple crappy snacks at the State Fair colored my view but I loved Brat Haus. And they served a yummy huckleberry lemonade at the Old Town farmer's market Sat. morning.",

Excellent spicy brats, wonderful pretzels, and delicious Gaffel Kolsch made our second trip a real treat.   UPDATE-Owner apologetic and accommodating following our one and only visit.  We intend to give it a second chance.  Horrible service. Called ahead, then arrived to find they never added our info.  Told a 15 minute wait.  After 50 minutes of waiting, finally got a table (inside, not outside as requested), then waited another 15 minutes with absolutely no visit from any server.  Decided to leave.  I was really excited to try the food, but not with that level of effort.  A flight to Germany would have been more bearable.",

We ordered the specialty brat by Chef Beckett with pickled onions as well as the kosher brat with kraut. All of their ingredients are homemade I as I was informed by our waitress. I really liked the Dijon mustard and thought the kraut was fresh, not too salty. We also ordered fries with dipping sauces. I assume the fries are twice fried, so if you like them crunchy, order them up. The truffle aioli and bleu cheese bacon dipping sauces were best. Sriracha dipping sauce is a good concept, but wasn't particularly flavorful.   The beer selection is great! Green Flash Palate Wrecker was priced very well, as was the Rasputin we ordered. A nice selection of a variety of beers, which I thought were fairly priced. (Sorry to Bud and Coors fans, get your cheap beer-water fix elsewhere).",

Attention Bells Two Hearted lovers...they have it...on tap! Not only that they have some of my favorites including a spread of Lagunitas, Stone and Dogfish Head.   On my first visit, we were not messing around and ordered the delicious Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. Be warned that it's a $15 bottle, which only seems expensive unless you have had it served to you somewhere else (Taste of Tops charges ~$20 when they have it in stock).   We split the pretzels and fundido to start. The pretzels are delicious and are a great  filler/base when tackling the beer menu. The fundido was good and I'd like to try it with sausage/exotic meat. I had the guest Sicilian sausage with peppers which was back-East-style delicious! The next evening we stopped in for apps, and I repeated the pretzel and fundido order and stuck with the Two Hearted all the way.   I can't wait for it to cool down a little bit so we can enjoy the expansive outdoor area. I also predict that this will be one of \"the\" destinations after spring training games. Well done Payton and I look forward to visiting again soon!",

We've been to Brat Haus before and really liked the food, so we were excited to have that option so close.  Our food was delicious - my fiance got the Bavarian Pretzel and the Grilled Chicken Wings, and I got the Haus Sausage will dill relish, and onions & peppers. I love that kind of food, and really enjoyed mine! We also had beer, and I always think that Brat Haus has a good beer menu with lots of choices.  I did only give this restaurant three stars because of the service. It took a very long time to get our food (too long for the simple items we ordered), and we did see other tables who had ordered after us get their food first. I'm not sure what was going on, but it would have been nice if our waitress stopped by to let us know, or tell us that our food would be out soon, something...but she seemed to disappear at that point and stop checking in on us. We really needed water, too.   Overall, I would still come back to this restaurant for the yummy food, but I would hope to get better service in the future :) they may have just been busy, but I don't think there's ever a good reason to wait so long for food.",

I gave the waitress Lauren G. my order of two items. Eventually I got part of my order and figured the rest was coming soon or I could remind her when she comes by to check on my table to see if I needed anything else (as good servers usually do) this never happened when I finished I waited for the rest then came the same waitress with my check. I said where's the rest of my order I reminded her what it was and I had to wait 15 minutes if not longer for a simple dish. When I was done she comes by again with my check I hand her my credit card and instead of going to charge my card she stops at the next table and has the longest conversation with people at that table making me wait even longer. Basically she had zero consideration of how I was inconvenienced from this long wait for my food due to her error. I got up walked to the register to give her a hint I'm ready to go and finally I get my card. I honestly think more training in customer service would benefit her. Furthermore, if she can't remember an order of two items maybe consider writing it down also check on your customers at least once as a good waitress should. I would not return do to the lack of good service and with all the food choices nearby I would easily choose another place to spend my money on.",

Their sausages, on the other hand, are mediocre. Also, please get a new vendor for your buns! Great outdoor seating if it's not too hot, with corn hole, giant Jenga, and beautiful murals. We came here at lunchtime on a weekday and were immediately seated, and service was prompt.",

They have 6 sauces you can use but real Germans use spicy mustard. It was so good I brought my mom here when she visited a few weeks later.   Parking can be a little tricky in this area. I found it's easiest to park in the parking corral just around the corner. Next the rehab burger.",

Brat Haus is the kind of place you love to give your money to because they are passionate about what they do.  From the awesome food they serve, to the fact that EVERY beer on tap is served in its appropriate style of glass direct from the brewer themselves, this place gets it right.  My go to items are their cheese curds, the Brat Burger (yum!), there fries with Truffled Aioli sauce (careful, the large fries is HUGE), their home made mustard, and their hand crafted brats.  Their patio is HUGE and is a fun time.  Plus the place is dog friend and dog loved (dogs eat free on Sundays!) so this is a must do on my list of old town.  Only gripe was parking (street only) but now that they have bought the restaurant next door, that is no longer a problem!  Say this in your best Arnold Schwarzenegger voice: GET TO THE BRAT HAUS!",

Personally, I wish they'd just look at us and go, \"oh, they'll probably be more comfortable in the larger seats\" without anyone asking.  Who knows to request a bigger seat when they were pretty much all the same size (at least in the room we were in)? What do you say? Two for the fat seats! Large freakin' mammals, party of three! Or perhaps, lead me to the biggest seat in the house! Awkward.... I do appreciate my concerns being addressed, though.

The fried pickles were okay but have had better in Midwestern bars. They have 28 craft beers on tap, so it's a great place to grab a brew. Try the 'Brat and Beer Flight' to get a good flavor of both. We also had the Sonoran Hot Dog (pretty yummy) with beans and jalapenos, and the foot long Brat (huge) with kraut and relish (also very yummy) washed down with a Hefewizen.

Those are the more rare beers that they have, but they do have a great variety of everything. The outside misters are a VERY good idea, I love how they are a 360 degree type, never have seen that before. They have mainly community tables as well, which is awesome if you have a big group. They have a giant Jinga game, as well as bags or cornhole as I have heard it be called.   Overall a great place to visit, wish we lived closer to Old Town or else we would be there more often!",

    "text": "So I personally am not a huge fan of the German foods, unlike my wife that loves this stuff. It was date night and I compromise sometimes so we took a visit to this restaurant that was new to both of us. Walking in it was lively, there was a couple guys jamming out on the accordion and don't know what the other thing was but it sounded good. They sat us quickly at this huge long table and honestly it wasn't as intimate as I thought it would be. There was like 4 feet of space inbetween us. We made the best of it though, you just kinda gotta holler at each other. My wife got the schnitzel and I got a spicy brat and she liked the schnitzel and my brat was pretty good but plain (maybe this is expected from german food?). The service was horrible though. We were checked on maybe 2 times in the whole 1.5 hrs we were there. Our water was mostly empty and my wifes beer never got offered to get refilled. As we left the host was playing on her phone not really paying attention to the 2 people standing behind her trying to get a table. She was nice enough to take a second from texting to wish us a good night. Based on service I wouldn't return, if my wife wanted to go back id sit thru it again.... The things we do for our wives.....",

Pretzels were fresh, hot, and delicious.  They're not authentic German style ones, by the way, but they are good for what they are.  The grain mustard was a little disappointing because it was so mild.  Fries were delicious.  Glassware is a nice plus.  Parking is even worse than the old Oreganos here because they nixed the interior spots too.  Staff seemed rather ignorant of beers they serve and beer in general, and this place is promoted as a beer destination.  UPDATE: bad service is more common on recent visits, including some attitude from one of the servers for no good reason.  Falafel appetizer was horribly dry and unpleasant on last visit too.    Looking forward to the Union Barrel House opening up next door which is supposed to be a craft beer destination sort of place.",

When my husband and I were served it, it tasted like it was going bad. We brought it to the server's attention, so she checked on it for us. She came back and told us that we'd need to order something else to drink because they wouldn't be making another batch until the following day. So I question how fresh it is. Then they were running low on their bottled sodas due to some event they had, so it took a few requests to finally get something to drink. Nothing that will keep us away. I just think next time we'll stick with beer.",

A little pricey on some of the selections, but it is Old Town. On occasion I'll order something and it's tapped out...and so us my second selection. Either people are drinking great beer faster than they can refill it or management needs to order a couple of extra kegs.

The bartender was covering outside as well as inside but was still out to visit my table quickly. He took the time to explain the menu to me and had an in depth knowledge of the rather large beer list and how the beer would pair with the various brats on the menu.  I find it very refreshing to have someone who just doesn't memorize the menu (which is a step above the server who fails to even be familiar with the menu), but actually knows the menu and how the various offerings work together.  The food was in line with the great service I received. I especially enjoyed the Belgian Fries.  I look forward to my next visit to Brat Haus!",

I am a fan of wheat beers, but there's a certain flavor I've never been able to tolerate in about half I've had. When I explained this to the bartender after my first sample, she knew exactly what I was talking about, and told me it's the type of the yeast used. She then gave me a sample of one that didn't have that particular flavor. I love it when someone not only listens, but engages on the topic with knowledge!  Since we were sitting at the bar, our bartender was also our server. She recommended the Chicken Thai sausage with the apricot chutney (after hearing me say I wanted something spicy), and was once again steered in the right direction. It was incredible. We also ordered some of the Belgian fries with the bleu cheese and bacon sauce, also just beyond... Then, for the piece de resistance, we split a piece of the  Drunken Date Cake. I'm not even that big a fan of sweet food, but this cake... takes the cake.   Some customers came in when the kitchen was about to close, but were not turned away. The manager even told them he would fire up the grill and cook the order up himself if the kitchen were indeed closed. Talk about great customer service!  The music being played is great, the atmosphere is comfortable and completely unpretentious, the service is excellent, the food perfection... seriously, what more good stuff can I say?   I will not only be returning, but I will also be recommending this place to everyone I know!",

    "text": "Sooo...Brat Haus was pretty amazing for me.  The beer selection was absolutely amazing. Was it pricey? Yes. I was there on a Monday night around 9 pm. They had two of my three all-time favorite beers--Bell's Two-Hearted Ale on tap and Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. The beer trifecta would have been completed if they had Bell's Hopslam, but that is my fault for not showing up at the right season.  Sure. When the DFH 120 Minute IPA is $15/bottle, it's not cheap, but, again, it's not your mom's Black Label. The Bell's Two-Hearted Ale on tap has a wonderful aroma, and the DFH 120 had a raisin-y nose without being too malty or alcoholic. How can something at almost 20% ABV be so, to use a BSG term, fracking awesome?  The service was amazing. Both the server and bartender, at almost closing were extremely attentive, providing me with both drinks and water. Once closing time hit, I never felt the pressure to GTFO. They were great about it. A quality you don't usually encounter in bars nowadays.  As for the food? It was pretty good. But, dear readers, my main goal for that night was to try and find a venue serving Bell's. DFH was a lucky afterthought. That being said, it's got an interesting menu. It would be a shame not to try something off of it.  Given the excellent beer menu, I will definitely be back. if you like craft beer, you will love this place!",

The miniVW bus up front was pretty cool too. We happened to eat there at the same time as the previous owner of the vehicle so heard some stories on it as well.

However, they're also one of the ones that serve the beer closer to the \"ideal temperature\" for tasting.  Let it warm to that, its not like we're sitting there chugging them I say!  Anyway, the brats I've tried so far are decent.  For me though sausage doesn't veer too much on the good or bad side, maybe because its always just been a flavoring agent for bread, pasta, etc.  The bread is actually really good here.  So why the 3?  I may be biased like I said but the brats I've tried so far (rabbit, sweet, spicy, regular) isn't that great or bad.  The toppings are neat and flavorful.  The 6 different sauces they have are 6 different sauces..  I kind of like the curry ketchup ok but the others is just not that good to me.  The sauerkraut is a lil bland.  The garlic fries were limp and not very garlicky.  The pretzel was really good!  The beer cheese was a bit.. lumpy?  Grainy?  Not cheesy enough for my taste I suppose, and slightly on the stingy side - I mean they charge like 3 bucks for it separately, can I at least get a full 1/2 cup??  Which brings me to the final bit - prices are a little high when you don't go for specials or during happy hour.  Still a bit high then..",

I ordered the Moroccan Lamb sausage with Apricot Onion Chutney topping. The sausage was spicier than I had expected, but good flavor. The French roll it was served on was fine, however, the bread to meat ratio highly favored the bread, which was a little disappointing. The Belgian Fries were delicious. I ordered the Truffle Aioli dip to accompany them, however, it tasted pretty much like mayonnaise. I preferred to use the table side Curry Ketchup instead...that was sweet and delicious!",

    "text": "Ambiance Taste Price  When you go to restaurants you usually get to pick two out of the three. With Brat Haus it was pretty good on all fronts but I felt something was lacking.  The Ski soda, mustards, and the fries were fantastic as were the truffle aioli accompannying the fries.   However, the Charcuterie pate and the beer brat in my opinion didn't hold up as well.  The pate was more meat loaf slices with interesting things nestled in. Maybe I deserved it for ordering pate at a german themed restaurant but I was expecting a smooth creamy terrine of liver pate.  The beer brat encased in roll with pickled onions didn't really shine either. In fact if it weren't for the distractions of the fries and mustards I might have noticed how underwhelming the taste of the brat was.  The house made dijon mustard however was stellar as it was as good as Maille in France.  I'm a little confused on the theme of this restaurant, is this a europub or german stein house. I would've liked a brat, potato pancake, and a spaetzle instead of a dressed up hot dog with one topping for $6.50.  The aesthetics and design of the place is pretty cool however, feels like your tucked away in a ski village in Europe.",

The Brathaus recently opened in the ever so familiar yet always at least hour wait location Oregano's used to be in.   First thing first I have to give kudos to whoever had the idea o get ride of those 4 parking spots Oregano's had and turned it into an open beer garden. Genius!   The Brathaus set up very similar to how Oregano's used to be expect now the building on the right is filled with 20+ craft international beers on tap. And if you want the True experience upgrade that craft beer to a DAS BOOT!  Now on to the food. A relatively simple menu and its exactly what you think brats, burgers and boxed water? Ya they have boxed water apparently its the best water in the world....for $10 a case it better be the drinking fountain of youth.   The bottom line is you get  a choice of brat from spicy, beer, sweet...the list goes on. Then you get a choice of traditional toppings 3 are included each one after that is .75cents a piece. For your side I would recommend sharing a large fries and make sure to ask for the dipping sauces they are awesome!   My brat was good I got a beer brat with sauerkraut relish and spicy pickles. It was cooked well, toppings were good and plentiful. If I had to critique I would say the bun was a little dry but that's if I had to say something.   Now we went on day 5 of them being open so talking about the service isn't totally fair so I'll be nice. The service was pretty lets say overwhelmed. We waited in front of the bar for close to 30 minutes before the bartender even noticed us. Then the food took a while but everything did come out right the first time. However I will say  our server was working his tail off to make sure everything was right so his effort offset the delays.   I will be going back to the BratHaus and hope this one of a kind spot in Scottsdale stays around for a while. I mean you can't beat a good beer and a brat.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time with some friends on a recommendation.  Was a great experience.  Though I am not a beer drinker, I know what a great beer selection looks like.  Brat Haus had an incredible selection of choices.  It is safe to say that you will find exactly what you are looking for.  They even serve the beer you select in its own personally crafted and labeled glass for that brand.  It was quite impressive.   The food was great.  Loved the home made sausages.  Like the beers, the selections were great.  Grilled and served on a flavorful, fresh and large bun, the sausages were excellent.  And, the condiment choices from a spicy dijon to a thick, full flavored whole grain mustard to their zingy curry ketchup were also very tasty.  You can sit inside or outside in a wide open patio.  The ambience is relaxed and casual.  Really loved this place, the food, and the service.  I will be back.  You need to check it out!!",

    "text": "I recently checked out this place after a friend had a craving for a hot dog/brat. I was curious to see how this place was, now that it was taking over the space that was previously Oregano's. The area that was once parking is now an awesome wide open patio area. And the fans going in the patio area made it bearable to be out there.   I wanted to guest chef sausage, but sadly, they were out, so I ended up going with the beer brat with relish. It was yummy. There was bit of heat to it, but not too much, just enough to keep it from needing any condiments to help in the taste department. They offered not only the usual, but they had a section for gourmet and exotic meats. Also got a side of fries with their hush hush sauce and their chipotle aioli. Their hush hush is reminiscent of In N Out's sauce which was yummy as was their chipotle sauce. They did offer ketchup and curry ketchup, but I didn't really indulge in that, but the curry ketchup was good with a fry or two. I did appreciate their beer selection. I tried their Lindemans framboise and their one that was apple. I think next time some of the other beers need to be tried but in the boot :P",

    "text": "Great food, atmosphere, and beer selection however a couple details are missing.   Me and some friends went and checked out Brat Haus in the afternoon/evening on a Friday night and overall it was a great experience. I was impressed with the menu and love the concept of beer first, food second. I had the spicy brat with an assortment of toppings which came out to around $7, which I would say was worth it.  We also got a large fries as an appetizer and I was very impressed, especially with the dipping sauces.  Why not 5 stars? I have run in to this WAY too much from places like Brat Haus. They set a great German mood with their Brats and import craft beer selection, so you really start to get into a German pub mindset then......Nickleback comes blasting onto the speakers. You put all this effort into making me feel like I am in a German, craft beer, easy going environment, but then you play a pop station that plays Nickleback and Lady Gaga. Take a couple days, make a playlist that goes with your atmosphere, this is important! The crowd here isn't the typical Scottsdale crowd, so they shouldn't play the typical Old Town Scottsdale music.  Other than this, great place and I will definitely be returning to play that strange washers game!",

I had the Duck, Duck, Dates with the apricot sauce on top.  The sausage was very tasty, but it sure was a tiny little thing!  They could have served it with a roll 1/2 the size and eased up on the amount of the apricots, which totally masked the flavor.  I also had the fries, which were very good, and the blue cheese bacon dipping sauce that had no flavor at all and looked like milk more than a dipping sauce.  I also loved the pickled veggies they served with the sandwich.  I am not a fan of high top tables either, and the only regular tables are outside.    The food was great, but as far as value goes, there are much better options out there.  I'd go back if I were in the area and hungry, but doubt I'd go out of my way to come back.",

We knew going opening week would be under par as the staff tries to gain their groove, so we went in with I'd say low expectations. We weren't disappointed. Our server knew nothing about the products on the menu or the beverages offered.   My friends each got craft brews and were offered non-chilled glasses, they opted to just drink out of the bottle. I tried the Strawberry fields cocktail. It tasted purely of artificial syrup - nothing fresh about it, and I couldn't tell if the Vodka made it in the glass or not.  We decided to start with the Pretzel and then each opted for different Brats so we could share and get a variety. The pretzel didn't come out till the brats did - so much for ordering an app. When it did finally arrive it was a very dark brown and somewhat mangled look,  we could have gotten past that if it at least tasted good, but not only was this pretzel an eye sore, it was a mouth sore. It was everything you don't want a pretzel to be - tough, chewy and burnt. Finally, the Brats... the Brats themselves weren't bad, but the Brat:Bread Ratio was way off. We received these huge Brat buns that were easily double the size of the actual brat. I wouldn't call myself a Brat aficionado I just can't imagine how you screw up such a simple and easy item - especially if you are the \"Brat Haus\". The one item of the whole evening actually worth noting was the Apricot Chutney, it was flavorful and the only reason I was able to finish my bready meal.   I would be up to giving them another chance, it seems everyone else had a much better experience. I hate to leave bad reviews, but hey, you can't win them all!",

I was parched and it was so yummy. We ordered the braised pig tail poutin and it was just incredibly good. Dear god, i want more now! The meat was off the bone and very tender in the gravy and the cheese curds just melted in your mouth. The potatoes were fried to perfection and the portion was more than enough for two. We also ordered the lamb sausage and the duck sausage. While I loved both, the lamb was the better of the two and the apricot chutney on it really complimented it well.

Anyway Brat Haus took over the old Oregano's spot which in itself is fantastic because they are already winning at that location, the patio is still huge and there are still several indoor dining areas that have been remodeled but still feel homey and comfortable.  They have a huge on tap beer selection and a nice menu of crazy brat options, for example the exotic section has rattlesnake and duck brats which I'm intrigued by but I'd rather play it safe.  Speaking of play it safe I DIDN'T, I look the waitress's recommendation of the Thai Chicken brat which was shockingly delicious and flavorful, service was quick and on point, the waitress was nice, attentive and attractive +1",

    "text": "Congratulations Dave and Payton - delivering a concept Scottsdale has been thirsting for (pun intended).  We were there yesterday for lunch, during the unexpected downpour, and the place was packed. Everyone inside avoiding the rain and the vibe was great.  I can imagine how wonderful it is going to be sitting outside on a warm evening.  I'll be back for that.   We ordered the fries, homemade pretzel, a regular beer brat with sauerkraut and the spicy brat.  The homemade pretzel is a standout.  Perfectly cooked - a yummy cloud of floury heaven with a chewy crust and the perfect amount of salt on top.  A very simple item but almost impossible to prepare perfectly and the Brat Haus did it. I paired it with the (non-alcoholic) ginger beer, which is a must try.   Both the brats were great, served on a really fresh bun and presented on a cool tray with a small side of Payton's pickled cauliflower. Lots of sauces available on the table, which up the fun factor.  Curry Ketchup anyone?  The fries weren't as hot as I would have liked, but chalk that up to an incredibly busy kitchen trying to keep up with the demand on the opening week.    My only complaint? The flavors are so yummy and seductive, I wanted more!   More please.  And, next time, with the Nutella milkshake spiked with a dram of whiskey.     Thanks Brat Haus for delivering a fun and flavorful alternative to the oh,so boring wine bars!!",

    "text": "Couldn't wait to check out this new neighborhood eatery in Old Town... We were there on the second night it was open which led to service quality issues, but that's to be expected initially.   We were seated at a large wood community table, with another party at the other end. I'm not a huge fan of this type of seating, but it wasn't bad. However, there was major confusion regarding table numbers for food delivery (for all of the patio) and discriminating which party had ordered what at the community table. I assume they will work out the kinks with this pretty soon because with a smaller menu chances are high the the party next to you ordered similar items and will end up with your food.   We had the chefs feature brat, this month from Justin Beckett, topped with root beer onions (highly recommend) and it was phenomenal! Best I have ever had! The fresh, soft bun was even a delight! The beer brat was also good, nice tart sauerkraut. Belgian fries were fantastic. Dipping sauces we chose were lackluster, we had the blue cheese and bacon as well as the thousand island, can't remember what they called it, skip both and try something else. Beet salad was also just o.k., very sweet. I had heard they had a bean salad at the soft opening that was fabulous and was looking forward to that, but it didn't make it onto the menu, yet. We ordered a pretzel with our meal as well, it did not arrive until 40 minutes after our dinner did. It was really very good. It was delivered without the food runner offering mustard, as they have 5 different varieties, for dipping, but we managed to flag another server down eventually to get them for us. The drunken date cake was maybe one of the best deserts I've tried in a long time! The portion was ample, perfect for sharing. The cake was incredibly moist, topped with a sweet caramel (?) glaze and served with a side of whipped cream adding just enough cool tartness to cut the sweet. It was perfect.   They did a good job with the decor, you definitely don't feel like you are on the patio of the old Oregano's, it's industrial, yet warm. I'm gonna give them a few weeks to get their legs underneath them before I give it another shot. Has the potential to be fabulous if they can iron out service.",

I'd characterize the restaurant as a pretty typical Old Town eatery--it caters to tourists, and the food is so-so. I knocked a star off my rating because the service was very slow, on an afternoon when the restaurant wasn't busy. I tried the spicy brat, and my wife had the beer brat--we both agreed the spicy brat was better.

It was so fresh we had to wait a while for it to cool down. It came with cheese fondue and special spicy mustard. I ended up getting the pig mac burger and the bf got the spicy brat with pickled peppers. We split both and boy it was good. The burger consists of 1/4 lb sausage & 1/4 lb beef. It was cooked so well and it was super filling. They have a hush hush sauce which is comparable to a thousand island based sauce. The spicy brat was probably one of the best I've had considering I am not a huge brat fan. Both items had quality bread. We got a large order of the fries to share amongst the table and they were awesome. I recommend the chipotle aioli dipping sauce, the bleu cheese- bacon sauce was alright but I wish we had tried the sriracha aioli sauce instead. They have a good selection of beers and the staff is very helpful. I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot!",

I wasn't impressed by their small selection of German food. I ended up ordering a schnitzel (only pork option, no veal) corn salad (not german by any stretch but since I was ordering the fries I didn't want two spuds) and fries. The schnitzel that was brought to me was about the furthest thing from. There were 3 very small pork patties breaded in what seemed (tho i could be way wrong) to be a panko breading. I don't even think they added any spices. Bland as can be. And at 14 bucks seriously? The fries were pretty good as was the curry ketchup. The only good thing about about the lunch was the drink I ordered and the staff. The staff was very polite and friendly.",

    "text": "How fun!  This was said over and over again on our most recent date night.  It was just that.  Driving around for parking was even fun - if you can imagine.  We wound up parking across the street in a parking lot that I think is used for overflow @ the hospital?  We saw these people bellied up to a moving bar - when we got closer we could see that it was something called Tour de Tavern.  Meet us @ the Brat Haus.  So it's powered by the people (think like a bicycle) and it goes to different bars throughout the night and I guess they wind up @ BH.  What a cute idea.  I will think about getting 15 friends together for this.  Sounds like fun.  Hubby is a big German food fan and I can usually find something to woof down.  This was so cute.  We approached, were seated immediately outside in their cute patio area.  Big picnic benches for community seating.  Tuba and accordion player belting out a little diddy.  Perfect.  We ordered beers and a pretzel with fundido for our appies.  Good.  Really good.  I picked the majority of the salt off of mine - it was just too much.  Cheese dip is thick and satisfying.  Beers were good.  We ordered two sausages each.  I loved mine and when we go back I will opt for no condiments.  I wound up scraping the majority of mine off and just eating it alone.  Which was great.  It was good by itself.  I didn't need two.  One is plenty with everything else we had.  We ordered fries too.  That siricha ketchup is so good.  I will try and make some on  my own.  It was that good.    No room for dessert we were done.  I bought a tee shirt for my sister that my waitress wore.  Speaking of our cute little waitress.  She knew her menu and was attentive without over doing it.  Someone else brought our food out and he managed to stick his finger in my ranch and acted like I didn't see it.  I asked our waitress if she would bring me a new one and she did - no questions asked.    Motto of the review.  HOW FUN!",

    "text": "Tonight was actually our second night at the Brat Haus - the first time we went for a few beers, a game of washers, and to try the bavarian pretzels - they were absolutely delicious that night  so we decided to go back...and soon.  We had a very different experience tonight.  After being seated we waited for 10-15 minutes before a server greeted us - he said that he would figure out who our server was but took our beer order.  When our server arrived she didn't apologize, nor did she introduce herself, she dropped off our beers, quickly took our order and was off.  It was another 45-50 minutes before our food arrived.  My husband ordered a beer brat, something he grew up with in Wisconsin and has made himself time to time.  He said that it was peppery and had no beer flavor and he didn't enjoy it at all.  He made better beer brats himself last weekend and the man is no chef!  I had ordered the vegan grain sausage and what I was presented with was a soft veggie burger.  I was a little confused but ate it anyway, it was rather bland and the \"burger\" part of it not at all crisp.  I was really excited for my \"fake brat\" so that was a disappointment and, frankly, should be listed under the burger section if that is the \"sausage\".  We ordered the fries as well which were ok - we would have loved to get them a little earlier if we'd known it was going to take so long to prepare our meals.  After dinner we had another round of beers and ordered another pretzel - this time, the pretzel we received was rock hard and not at all enjoyable to eat.  We had asked for honey mustard and curry ketchup and received honey on the plate.  After 2 hours we had finally paid our bill and walked quickly away from a bad dining experience.  The only positive thing I can say about this place at this point is that the beer is decent, but it's not the only place in Phoenix with decent beer.  I'm not sure what was going on with this place tonight, but I hope they figure things out.  This is exactly the kind of concept of a place we would go to regularly but after tonight my husband said he won't go back.",

That's the good part besides the expansive selection of beer on their menu and what you should really be focused on as the food is mediocre at best.   While I definitely like that they are carrying \"natural\" meat products from suppliers such as Niman Ranch, their fries didn't deserve the tag Belgian and their sausages had nothing to do with the German Bratwurst original besides the name.   So I guess this place is really just for people who think (or don't) that the u \"Umlaut\" in Brathaus  must be a sign of authenticity.   Speaking of authenticity...why make a patron wait to be seated if communal tables in the Biergarten are readily available? I'd open up the awesome outdoor area for everyone to just go and find their favorite spot.   If you can ignore all of the above (as I did) and just come here for loud fun and drinks you will still have a good time!  Just don't expect the food to keep up with it.  Three stars for the atmosphere and beer selection.",

You can never go wrong with Pretzels and 3-cheese-beer dipping sauce.  The last time I tried the Moroccan Lamb sausage.  Very delicious with the Apricot Onion Chutney.  Belgium Fries are a must and don't forget the Truffle Aioli!  I am not one for having dessert but everyone must try the Drunken Date Cake.  This delicious cake is made with Oatmeal Stout and will have you asking for more.    A trip to Brat Haus is the perfect way to start a night in Old Town.  I love that they constantly change their mural.  Thanks Dave and the wonderful staff of Brat Haus!",

The pretzels were so awesome and the sauce, that I'd go back for them.   I got the San Tan Count Hopula  (sp?) which I loved but when I asked for a second one, it was NOT the same beer. I was very disappointed. I sent it back.  She brought another back and swore it was the Count Hopula but I know that beer. It wasn't. She was adamant. I was disappointed. Pretzels and ambience is 4 stars, waitress and bad beer not so much.",

Ordered brats and they were severely overlooked and bad. The spicy one was so bad that it was hard all the way thru. The cook ought to go to Ted's to see how good brats are cooked! Tried Belgian Fries and they were so overcooked that they were black brown in color and totally crispy. Draft beer was almost warm and very expensive.  Food was very expensive too. Food served was cool, probably because it came from a building next door. We were in bar. Bill for 4 lunches and a couple of beers was over $160. My summary: A BAD HOT DOG STAND, OVERLY EXPENSIVE, WITH SOME GOOD BEERS ON TAP...BUT WARM. Will never go back.",

    "text": "Went here at 7pm on a Saturday and I honestly have no complaints. You can see from my other reviews that I'm very picky about my 5-star ratings and I couldn't come up with one reason to ding a star after our experience here. This is probably the least pretentious and upscale place that I've ever given a 5-rating to.  We came back here with friends after hubby and I had a great time at the Yelp Elite event here a few months back. The actual location is two separate buildings plus abundant outdoor seating with misters and heat lamps. There was a bar area that we didn't go into, and a small cafe-type area which is where we sat. Since we were a party of 6 they sat us at the big central table, where we were elbow to elbow with other diners already there. We ordered a ton of food, beer and other drinks and it was all excellent. Our server was at the top of his game as well.  Whatever else you eat here, DO NOT miss the pretzels with beer cheese dip. I'm serious. When you think you want Bavarian style pretzels this is what you have in mind. The waiter told us that they actually do use a lye solution here, which is the traditional way of getting the dark crust on them. Most places use baking soda which is close but not quite right. And the beer cheese dip was awesome enough to just eat with a spoon.  Same goes for the french fries with dips. We demolished two large orders and all 4 of the dips we tried were awesome. The real heart of the menu is the brats though. Next time we go here (and there will be a next time), I'll order that instead of the burger. I was happy with my burger (and if relish always tasted like that I'd eat more relish), but my friend's brat looked awesome enough that I regretted not getting one.  The beer menu was extensive and everyone at my table seemed happy with what they ordered. I had a \"grown up\" Nutella milkshake which was every bit as delicious as you'd expect from the name. I'm not sure what kind of alcohol was in it- maybe spiced rum, but it was perfect with the Nutella.",

    "text": "Sorry, not impressed!  I was so excited to take our family to dinner here tonight (7-13-2012)  I think I worked myself up on expectations and everything fell short.    First, we were told a 10 min wait for a table for 2 adults and 4 kids, we waited over 45 minutes and watched everyone who came in behind us get seated.  Imagine the anxiousness of our kids!!  While waiting, the host asked us if we wanted anything, but then told us that she couldn't actually serve us???  What?  She then proceeded to tell us to get up and go order whatever we wanted from the cashier at the bar, but that they couldn't serve us because they were afraid the kitchen would get overwhelmed!!!  Ok, really?  The hosts need a lot of training, a lot!!!!  Finally, we get a table, we ordered some beer brats, Haus burgers and some fries.  Everything was just \"ok\".  The buns are way bigger than the brats, a couple of the buns were soggy, the sauerkraut tasted like it came out of a can and was cold!  Pretzel was good, dipping sauces were unique and good.  Prices for food were fair, but the beer was expensive.  The ambiance was great, clean and new.  But I didn't come to spend $75  to look at some furnishings and interior design work.  The waiter himself tried hard and did a good job.  He brought our kids free cookies as an apology, I didn't actually get one, but they told me the cookies rocked!  I wish he would have given the bill to the kids too!  Really wish this was a good review, but it just started all wrong with a terrible first impression.  I would wait to visit after a few months of them trying to get it right, or, just don't waste your time or $$ at all!!",

    "text": "A while back I got a chance to meet Chef Payton Curry and try his cuisine at Welcome Diner his short lived concept in Downtown Phoenix, incorporating planned obsolescence. Post Welcome Diner, Curry could be found making guest chef appearances at various restaurants around town as well as throwing \"Guerrilla dinners\" with his merry bunch of culinary misfits. Over the past few months Curry has been keeping his culinary skills sharp in the kitchen of Chef Charlene Badman at Scottsdale hot spot FnB.  Fast forward to Today and the first service at Curry's newest venture, Brat Haus.  Nestled in the space formerly occupied by Oregano's Pizza, Brat Haus is spread out among two buildings with a \"climate controlled\" outdoor patio. (The 360 degree mister was a nice touch and quite refreshing on a hot day but I don't know if I would go as far as agreeing with our hostess that the patio is climate controlled)  First up from the Haus, a stone hearth pretzel I have been drooling over on Facebook for the past week.  This rustic pretzel, served with grainy Haus mustard, is just what I had been hoping it would be (so much for maintaining objectivity).  A combination of hard and chewy, kissed with the perfect amount of salt, the Haus pretzel does not disappoint.  If I hear of anyone asking for cheese sauce to dip one of these happy little twists in, I may cry).  I've eaten my fair share of Bratwurst including a few while in Germany which were pretty memorable but over-all, i've just never eaten one and exclaimed \"DAMN! that's delicious.\"  Well, I can no longer make that statement as the Spicy brat ($5.75) topped with my choices of spicy peppers (of course) and root beer onions nestled in a chewy french roll just plain rocked.  Juicy, flavorful and possessed of the perfect meaty texture, the traditional spicy brat is a winner. (there will be many more of these in my future)  Accompanying my brat were thrice-cooked belgian fries ($4.50/Large).  Lightly seasoned frites, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside as they should be, served with choice of dipping sauces (in this case truffle aioli and Sriracha Aioli), the Hause fries are not only a perfect companion to a brat but a necessity in my humble opinion.  Last but not least, the ubiquitous hamburgers, or are they?  You will find a \"regular\" burger in the form of the Haus Favorite but that is where the \"norm\" ends.  There is a brat burger i'd probably want for breakfast every morning consisting of a 1/3lb pork sausage patty topped with a fried egg and swiss cheese ($6.75) and the 800 pound gorilla in the room, the \"Pig Mac.\"($7.25)  What's this you say? The Pig Mac? Let me get this straight, Curry thinks it's a good idea to combine a 1/4lb pork sausage patty with a 1/4lb ground beef patty topped with caramelized onions, bound with something called \"Hush Hush sauce?\"  Well it's a good gawddamned thing Curry has the twisted mind he does because there are few things pork can't make better and apparently a juicy, well seasoned hamburger is one of them.  I don't know why I haven't thought of doing this before but it works.  This mingling of textures and flavors going on here is like the crossing of the proton streams in Ghostbusters except I didn't end up with marshmallow goo on my face.  I must say, I would have rather had a traditional spicy brat split and perched atop my burger a bit more as I preferred its texture and spiciness to the patty but again, this is a winner.  It's about time someone broke the mold and opened a restaurant that didn't fall into line with the current trend of cookie-cutter concepts, frozen yogurt, cupcake shops and gourmet burger joints come immediately to mind.  Curry and his Brat Haus have brought something simple, fresh and different to the Scottsdale culinary scene. (I'm sure others will follow in short order).",

To my disappointment, my cheese board came much later than my friend's meal but to have it arrived after they finished their meal and our drinks.  Come on.. it's not like you had a slew of hot dog connoisseurs in line waiting for the next big wiener.  I felt a bit embarrassed about the whole experience and upset at that so I decided to call the manager the next day. When I spoke to the Manager, he stated he had heard about the feedback and since I'm calling again, I must wanted something for free. WTF, I'm not bitching about a $10 happy hour cheese board but the fact that you have ridiciously slow service and to have that attitude when a customer calls in to let you know their experience.  There's plenty of restaurants in the valley and to tell you the truth, Ted's Hot dogs in Tempe delivers much better food and I can go elsewhere for a cold brew.",

My favorite was the curry ketchup and honey mustard that is made with local organic honey--so good!

We got the pretzels & cheese fondue, which was pretty good. The pretzels came out really fast so they are clearly prepared well ahead of time, which is reflected in the texture (harder and tougher than the soft pillow homemade pretzel I was hoping for) but the cheese sauce far & away makes up for that! It's awesome, enough said. There are a few vegetarian options, but not a lot which is probably to be expected from a menu that says \"swine dining\". I had the shaved raw salad and enjoyed it.  I highly recommend visiting the Brat Haus for some beer & fun. It really is a great outdoor patio to relax at.",

I've only been to Germany once, so I'm no expert, but it really did remind me of a few Biergartens I've seen.    Since it's Oktoberfest season, they had a really good line up of draft German beers.  I had the Spaten Oktoberfest and my partner had the Bayerischer Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan Weibier (clearly he's a complex person lol).  Reasonably priced @ $5 a glass made it totally worth it to splurge into the foreign beers.    I had the Hausbrat with Sauerkraut and Relish, adding Curry sauce to it they had sitting at the table.   Amazing Brat and very delicious.  Not traditionally presented, as the bun was much shorter than the brat, and more of a potato bread roll than a Brat Bun, it was still very good and I appreciated the lesser amount of carbs.    The only feedback I'd give is that when we were served they forgot the silverware, napkins and condiments.  The visits from the waitress was few and far between so we were a bit worried after she scurried off that we'd have to go on adventure to drum something up.  The manager was very observant however, and saw the look on our faces and got us all squared away quickly.    We will be back!",

With or without the tasty bun. Your sausage comes with your choice of condiment (I chose the pickle relish for my beer brat and the sauerkraut for the lamb sausage) and if you have another $6 you can get a pint of Hefeweizen to accompany the sausage. Maybe dig around in your money belt and locate another $6 and order a Chimay instead of a Hefe? It'll come in an authentic Chimay glass, as will the other super legit crafty beers on the menu.  Try out the home made pretzel, but you don't need to dip it in fundido because the mustard is quite good and some fusion just doesn't quite work. Seriously...I know it's AZ and all, but that's a miss of a combination.  The staff is attentive and they know the menu well enough to riff with you on pairing beers with what you order from the food column. Our server said something about a Nutella-chocolate-malted shake at the end of the meal so we had to add that experience to the meal and it didn't disappoint at all. So good, in fact, that Nutella will be added to all home made milkshakes in my blender from now on.  I would come back again and again and again to Brat Haus.",

The beer menu is tremendous. You really can't go wrong with anything. Ask your waiter/waitress for recommendations on pairing beer with your food.   The brat was fantastic. The bun was toasted to perfection and the toppings were all fresh. If you like spicy throw some Dijon mustard on it. Your mouth will be on fire.",

Music was a little loud for normal conversation, but it really added to the fun atmosphere. It was a beautiful night, and we will be back again in the future. Nice place to bring out of towners too, since it's away from the noisier bars down the street. Great beer selection too.",

Victoria also brought the truffle aioli to accompany the dish..FANTASTIC! We also found out you can have a party catered or do a whole pig roast with a work group or a gaggle of buddies.. How cool is that? The weekly specials Monday ( Happy Hour all day!!! ) Tuesday ( Tacos) Wednesday ( Burgers & bikes) etc.....Huge beer selection.

Myself for a 3rd time, and him for the first time. Parking is located in spots around the area, no direct parking at the restaurant. Being Oktoberfest it was a little busy, but the owner Dave, accommodated us and we were seated fairly quickly at the bar. I ordered a dunkel and the pic Mac. My boyfriend had the big weenie. Both were equally delicious and the array of sauces to choose from even better! The curry ketchup was the perfect side to dip my burger into. I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for a good brat or a good brew. Plenty of options for seating as well as selections of good eats. I look forward to coming back soon!!",

    "text": "August 16th.  National Bratwurst Day.  Apparently it took a completely made up holiday (not that I'm complaining) to get me in the door of Scottsdale's famed German sausage stop and beer garden.  I love sausage.  I struggle to think of any time I had a sausage and didn't enjoy it (get your mind out of the gutter).  And yet, I never made it a priority to get to Brat Haus.  I mean, all bratwursts are the same, right?  German themed restaurants (what few there are in the valley) are essentially the same, right?  Time to answer these and other questions on a Thursday during happy hour.  Look for Brat Haus on the west side of Scottsdale Road just south of 2nd Street.  Dave Andrea and Payton Curry are the brains of this small complex including a pair of buildings and an outdoor beer garden out back.  As today was a brisk 105 outside, I opted for a spot at the bar inside.  While no one will mistake this for an authentic old school German establishment, Brat Haus does take some pains to ensure that most of the menu (especially the beer selection) does its darnedest to pay tribute to some of Germany's finest brews and pub fare.  For Bratwurst Day, they offered any of their regular brats for free with the purchase of an appetizer.  Fair enough.  But for starters, we need a beer.  And it just so happens they have Germany's oldest brewery on tap (among about 30 other drafts).  A 16 ounce Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is just what I needed to get started.  A smooth old school Bavarian classic that's perfect for any occasion.  Next, Yelpers raved about the pretzels here.  So I got one of my own.  A soft pretzel served with beer infused cheese on the side.  I have nothing but positive things to say about the beer cheese but the pretzel was pretty disappointing.  I was expecting soft, chewy and easy to pull apart, but it was pretty tough.  The flavor of the pretzel was okay, but I really had to dig in hard with my teeth to chew each piece.  Almost as if it had been sitting under warming lamp and gotten stale.  Bummer.  I followed that up with a small order of their Belgian fries with the Haus Aioli (which as best I call tell is just mayo and garlic).  Again, an okay dish, but overhyped.  The fries didn't have the crunch I'd hoped for and were pretty soggy in spots.  So after some lackluster apps I finally got my brat.  The Haus Brat with sauerkraut and dill relish.  I won't say the brat blew me away, but the combination of flavors were nevertheless delicious.  The casing had a good snap and the sausage had a nice pleasant perceptible hint of oregano that I liked.  Total cost for all the beer, all the food, tax and tip came to $21.  If you remove the one time free brat discount, my bill would've been closer to about $33.  Like I said, the apps were lackluster.  The brat and beer?  Plenty to like about those.  A mixed first impression for me to be sure.  I know they have a huge Oktoberfest celebration in the Fall so maybe I'll look to check that out.  I can understand the affection this place garners from its regulars (particularly for the beer selection), but the food could use a little fine tuning.  Here's hoping my next bratwurst craving will yield a better all around experience at the Haus.",

There are games to play, trees and stretched awnings to cut down on the sun during the day.    The beer selection offers a variety to try.  Wine and other liquor options available too.  So, if on a pub crawl,  then crawl no further.  Seriously, it's Scottsdale, they probably frown on that.",

    "text": "I must say, I haven't been this disappointed in a dining experience in quite a long time.  My husband has been several times without me and really enjoyed it.  During a recent outing to Old Town Farmer's Market with our pup, a server excitedly told us we had to go with our dog.  So we did.    After being seated, we were given water and menus, but it was at least 15 minutes before anyone took our order.  Finally, we were in business.  However, food was incredibly slow in spite of the fact the restaurant was not that busy.  I assumed it was the kitchen, until it arrived cold.  Clearly, it had been sitting quite a while.  Again, more service issues.  We were not the only ones.  We overheard a nearby table cancel part of their order due to poor service.  And for a restaurant that seems to market itself on being dog friendly, it really was anything but.  No water was brought for our dog, which is okay, as I had a dish and water in my bag.  We ordered the special brat for dogs and the dog beer.  The brat was served, but they forgot the beer.  When it finally did come, the server didn't bother to bring a bowl.   I guess my dog was expected to grow a thumb to pop the tab and drink out of the can.  He gave the brat high marks.  Although by this time, I'm pretty sure he was over being there as I was as well.  Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent, in spite of it being cold.  But the poor service will likely discourage me from returning. I don't think my husband will be suggesting Brat Haus for work place functions again.",

I had an on-tap Pilsner made from a local brewery which was simply fantastic--crip, cool, perfect.  Then came the sausage which was so flavorful and I loved the onions and peppers.  The location is adorable in Old Town and the young ladies waiting on everyone couldn't have been nicer or more helpful.  I understand the owner is Lebanese (compliments) and this place really is a nice addition to downtown Scottsdale.",

    "text": "So right off the brat...er...bat, let's take inventory on some of the things that Brat Haus has going for it:   First of all it has bratwurst and other German inspired food and beer. We're talking tons of Brat options as well as some unique custom creations like chorizo, snake & rabbit, on top of other staple German foods like schnitzel etc., and giant pretzels.  Secondly, it has a great biergarten. There's plenty of tables, space heaters, a couple trees, and an area for some games like cornhole, jenga and ping-pong. So basically, plenty of room for eating, drinking and socializing! Perfect!  Thirdly, it's located off the main drag of North Scottsdale Road which has plenty of other local attractions and can provide for plenty of people watching.   Then lastly, it's right next door to Scottsdale's finest brewery, Goldwater Brewing. Which makes Brat Haus perfect for a meal and drink before or after a visit to their neighboring business.  When all of these things are considered, it's hard not to like Brat Haus. Upon my friendly server's recommendation, I went with one of the unique offerings, the \"Snake & Rabbit\" which was literally made of snake and rabbit meat. It was served properly cooked and and with a special sauce to help compensate for a somewhat slightly bland flavor profile of the two meats. Overall it worked pretty well, and was a pretty tasty dish that hit the spot for the most part.  Can't really fault Brat Haus for anything, other than it would nice for them to include sides with the Brats especially when some of the special dishes are up to $13 such as the one I ordered. However, all things considered, you can still get a solid meal here for a fairly reasonable price in a pretty nice area. I'll take that as a win.",

We chose to be seated outside since the weather was finally cool enough to do so.  This time, I ordered the pretzel appetizer.  It was phenomenal.  Best pretzel on the planet.  My son ordered the spicy brat and garlic fries, and I ordered the burger w/cheese and garlic fries, and we both had beer.    The first time we came here, I ordered the burger because the waitress said they grind their own beef and season it their own way.  I was blown away by the flavor, and was so looking forward to the same experience.  This time I was a little let-down as the flavor was very different.  There were visible seeds in the burger that 'popped' when chewed, and I really didn't like that very much.  (I believe they were mustard seeds.)  The fries were great, except they weren't as garlicky as the first time we were there.    We love the buns at Brat Haus - really the best of any restaurant we've visited.  Service was great, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  Our waiter knew his beers.  And the pretzel is terrific.  I'm sure I'll go back, but just for a pretzel and beer.",

I will go out of my way to come back, just to have their Pretzels. They are perfectly authentic in every day, even down to the preparation with real lye. (Something most places are afraid to do) and the rock salt they are sprinkled with. I am frothing at the mouth just thinking about it. Words cannot describe.  I'd like to give this place 4 stars due to the cramped quarters and inadequate number of restrooms, (it is a little pricey too) but really I just don't have the heart to.

    "text": "Love the Brat Haus. Great beer selection, relaxed vibe, good food, just a really nice atmosphere...  ...BUT, do not do the pig roast they offer for large parties. Not at all worth what they charge for it, and frankly not that good. We were served frigid cuts of pork from a pig that was supposedly roasted just for us (we never saw it, so with the flavor and temperature we guessed it was left overs from someone else's party). Yes, it was served almost refrigerator cold. It's served on mashed potatoes and mixed veggies that tasted like they came from a can. Just completely disappointing. At $50/person my big group was hoping for a fun, unusual, communal experience, but man, it was like a bad school lunch. Not one person in our party of 25 enjoyed it.  Again, I highly recommend the Brat Haus for just about everything else. But I just feel like I have to comment on the pig roast.",

(did i mention that both the cake and caramel have beer in them?)  fourth time -- Oktoberfest! Sat on the patio sunday night and had one of their chewy, salty vegan pretzels, made unvegan by ordering cheese sauce with it, a great pork schnitzel that was topped with an incredible lemon/parsley relish, and a huge pile of German dumplings, spaetzle.  We finished with a pretty darned good apple strudel. Oh, and of course, several rounds of good German beer.  Prost!",

This is a great restaurant and I've tried many things on their menu and have loved all... with one exception.  The German potato salad with fingerling potatoes would be the bomb if it weren't for the occasional bits of hard grit. I get that fingerling potatoes are very small and hard to clean. Totally do.  It would take hours to scrub the grit off of those things one at a time, but until you can find a way to do that, you just shouldn't serve them. It's a shame because the flavor of the two bites I ate was very good. Maybe it was one batch that didn't get the scrub attention needed, but it was enough to turn me off of the potato salad.  Still... the rest of the menu is enough to bring me back.",

    "text": "The five of us (including one dog) got dinner here tonight and were pretty satisfied. Being very German, I can confidently say that this is very American German food. The flipped Hofbrauhaus logo that they use for their Brat Haus emblem is apt, as they have flipped some classics, such as potato salad and brat wurst.  The boar, pepperjack, and haus brats were good, but not spectacular - a bit dry, really. The dork burger was really good, especially with a fried egg added on top, and the Schnitzel sub was about a 4/5. The butcher's plate was good, but nothing special, same with most of the toppings, with the exception of the rootbeer onions, which were really awesome and would put the right brat over the top, if paired correctly.   Good luck with that, though, as the server we had wasn't really any help with any selection; it seemed as if she had only just read the menu (or was new). Drinks were great - beers of a great variety as well as a soda and the \"adult style\" nutella shake. The dog loved her brat, but it doesn't take much to please a hound. We got the nutella desert to share, but it didn't live up to any great expectation.   Atmosphere was fine, but we were unhappy that our server had to come back at least three times to tell us something we had ordered was no longer available (including the yelp chili offer, the boot, the veal brat, and the butterscotch rootbeer). Overall a pleasant place, but very expensive, especially since the brats and sandwiches came with nothing else - no fries or anything (except the potato salad, which was a steal at $3.50).",

Great beer selection but felt like the food options were a bit lacking. Pretzel was really good. I don't even remember what type of brat I tried...it was not super memorable. But I tasted a little bit of everyone else's and - when you try all they have to offer - it's not bad but really didn't floor me either.

Their serious love for all meats encased and ridiculous love for mustard (and German beer) is enough to keep this place on my list to take visitors and friends alike.   The brats are delicious. Any choice is a sure winner, but my favorite is the spicy wurst with root beer onions on top - a great combo of a little savory/spicy/sweet that is so good. If it's your first time Id suggest the brat and beer flight, where you get to sample three different kinds of brats plus three five ounce beer tasters. It's kind of awesome.   Their pretzels are perfect. I think right now they have a yelp deal where if you check in you get a pretzel with a side of Nutella. They're just so good and crunchy and soft.   Also the fries - get them. And get the hush hush sauce (or the chipotle aioli, or the Sriracha aioli...), you won't regret it!  Did I mention the patio? Guys. The patio. The outdoor space is giant, with lots of options from big long picnic style tables to small two-tops, peppered with trees, heaters and misters that make it the perfect phoenix patio. They're ready for you whether you have a group of two or twenty - definitely check it out!",

So we did. And we opened a beer. Then we had someone come up and rudely demand we pour out our beers and proceeded to rip a beer out of my friend's hand. Aggressively while she wasn't even looking. When I tried to apologize and explain that we were told to bring our own beer and we had no problem follow the rules (I totally get it! We had no problem with the rule. We were just misinformed. Not our fault.) he scolded us like we were two year olds in time out.",

After waiting for 15 minutes we finally got to bartenders attention and ordered drinks. The staff was clearly overwhelmed but it seemed as though it would've been their first day open. The environment was so stressful and the gentleman who seemed to be the manager even was snappy with customers. My date ordered our food and the bartender (who was clearly in a bad mood) wouldn't even allow him to add sauerkraut to his bratwurst order. It was so bizarre how poorly run this place was. I felt uncomfortable, unwanted, and stressed the entire time there. I will not be returning.",

I was craving some sausage & soft pretzels and was definitely not disappointed. The beer cheese sauce was damn near drinkable and I easily couldve eaten 4-5 cups of it.   The pretzel was homemade and super fresh.  About 8-9min later, my polish sausage came out and man oh man was it good. Great flavor and the onion jelly was super good. As I write this review I wish I ordered the sausage with the beer cheese on top. Damn... oh well haha   Great place and I'll be back!",

    "text": "Today was my first experience at the Brat Haus and for the circumstances I'd say my overall visit was reletively pleasant.  A group of about 12 of us came in for lunch on about mid day Friday afternoon, a waitress(the only one working) placed our orders in a timely manner and explained to us that they were short handed for the day and opologized, though she did a great job keeping up with our crowd!  I personally ordered the \"mega weenie\" and shared one of the giant pretzels with a few colleagues(forgot to take some snap shots of it).  In terms of the mega weanie it came out in a reasonable amount of time but it seemed to be more room temperature rather than \"fresh-out-the-oven\", but again we were in a pretty large group and coming from a restaurant background I understand it can be difficult firing a bunch of orders and getting them out all at once.  The overall taste was pretty solid, if you love a relish/coleslaw type of topping on your brat I would definitely recommend it, and their curry ketchup was a great(free) add on!",

If you're not into brats, they offer other things like pretzels, burgers, and fries. They have tons of space, both inside and outside, and the service is nice.   This is a great spot to visit if you have friends in town who are looking to have a nice time. You'll really impress if you order one of their big ass pretzels, too!",

All orders looked as if we had ordered in house, impressive.   I hesitate to order anything with a bun for delivery but this place is probably the only exception. Each brat's bun was grilled so it was semi crispy on the outside, soft on the inside but not soggy. I don't know how they do it, not soggy at all!!   Highlights of order: - Hot Italian is amazing. The sausage is incredibly flavorful. We added the caramelized onions-  taste as if they have been slow cooking for days, so good. I never thought I'd say this, but if you want a luxury hot dog this is what you want to order (it's the truffle cheeseburger of hot dogs, no.. there is not truffle in it).   - Haus is everything you'd want in a Chicago style hot dog, all the toppings on grilled bun  - Prezel with beer cheese, cheese is very light on flavor but the pretzel is perfect. Semi crunch outside with soft interior. I'd probably prefer this mustang ilo of the beer cheese",

The servers have this spaced out look on their face most of the time and I'm pretty sure they might be high, because that would be the only way to pass off their attitude and laziness.  The food here has been pretty good, while not anything amazing that I have to run and tell all my friends about it's all around good.  The Pig Mac has great flavor, but the sausage patty that comes with it is too thick and not even close to being the same size as the burger patty so it makes for an awkward eating experience.  The brats they server are really tasty and the onion jam is bomb diggity.  Great lunch special as well with the fries, brat and drink for 11 bucks!  I'll have to give this place a try again when I can come back and enjoy some drinks and even add some CBD oil into it which is a fantastic idea and the first place I've seen do this.    Great patio for hanging out with your friends, and I feel a much better party environment than a lunch place.",

There are misters but only reach half the patio. My bad for choosing the grass for the pooches.   Now for the beer selection and the food- they are both extremely good!! I got the brat flight. 3 smaller sausages with nicely paired local beers. The fiance got the Beyond Brat who's tastes so much better when it's cooked right. I tend to mess them up. Even the pups got their own sausage so none felt left out. We also ordered some fried which were cooked to perfection.   Nick was especially nice ( every one we've met has been) and even brought the fuzzy ones some cookies. Would highly recommend! Just need more tails so we can book a puppy party next time!",

One of the waitresses were nice enough and let me try a few different beers before ordering, but then walked off. We were standing around for 10 minutes before someone helped us, so we decided to go grab a table outside so we could play corn hole.   The mural that they had outside was rad, and the corn hole area had sand so it was definitely interesting. This place is obviously popular as there were a ton of groups there. Our waitress however, was not very friendly or patient. We had 6 people to our group and had already been drinking so we're obviously going to be indecisive.   She kept giving us different facial expressions, and just al around seemed like she didn't want to be there. We ordered food and a couple more rounds and were able to play corn hole after the couple that was playing were done. I went to the restroom and had two ladies try to enter while the door was locked, kept giggling the handling and banging on the door.   Our food took awhile but when it came out was pretty good. I would say that the rating I gave is more for the customer service and environment, the food was good and the corn hole was fun.",

    "text": "Brathaus serves some of the most interesting German cuisine you'll find in the entire valley, they have outstanding sauces, their mustard is worth the trip alone, they have a fantastic selection of beers, you'll see favorites on tap that you can't find anywhere else. And yet... some of their selections are so overpriced as to be laughable. Their sandwiches and brats go for 9 - 15 dollars, plus 5 more if you want fries with that.  They sell an appetizer, sauerkraut balls, which should bring shame on any restaurant. The ingredient list sounds great, but you'll find that you've spent 9 dollars on three deep fried balls of sauerkraut, very lightly peppered with the things that actually bring flavor to the dish. I enjoy the staff, I think the owner takes a pride in their work, but I'm driven to give this poor review after today attempting, over the course of an hour, to contact them in order to place a to-go order. They didn't answer the phone at first, then when they finally deigned to receive a call, I was immediately placed on hold, which I disconnected from after TEN minutes of waiting. Some poor menu choices aren't enough for a bad review, combined with poor service, however, and I need to voice my concerns.  If you're in the mood for a good brat and don't mind paying out the nose for it, you couldn't chose a better option. If you want good service, you'll get it if you dine in, usually. If you want great German and Belgian beer options ON TAP! this is a great location for you. If you want value for money spent, find yourself another option.",

There were people eating and drinking, some with children and dogs. Overall a good spot to hang out with friends and have some beers.  While here I had a had a Brat. Ordered the spicy Italian with sauerkraut. the food came out in reasonable time, but with unremarkable table appearance, very basic. Brat on bun with sauerkraut and a couple of dill chips in  paper basket. It seems they could throw on a few potato chips or coleslaw to fill the space and justify the $9.50 price. The Brat was okay , a little dry, the bun was good and the the sauerkraut was , well sauerkraut. Similar or less to street fair food with street fair price.  To summarize I would say nice spot with good vibe to hang out with friends. Average food and service with high price.",

Benches, and small tables with table games and giant Jenga available.   The food is brats with other things like Ruben and some vegetarian options available. Everything is made in house which is amazing.   We had the following: Brat sampler with 3 sausages: sweet Italian, spicy Italian and pepper jack. Each is on a different veggie component. Each was distinctive in flavor and each was delicious.   Impossible burger: we have been wanting to,try this for a while. Wow. If I was served this without knowing it was not beef I would never have known. Tasted just like a beef burger. Neither of us could tell it was not beef. Great taste, nice bun. Impossible!  Pretzel: Good size and the cheese sauce was quite beer-y in flavor.   Pickel sampler.  We love the house made pickles. Yum.   Fried pickles. Super good. Very brinry and nice and crisp.  The accompanying sauce was delicious also.   We tried the house pastrami which was delicious.   They have like 28 beers available on draft along with a selection of bottled beers.   The service was a bit slow. It was busy.   Overall food was 4/5. Service was 4/5. The music was really good. Classic rock and not too loud.",

    "text": "Any fry cook knows to vent the box or pack fries in a bag so the internal potato steam goes up to the heavens if you want them crispy after a two block drive home.  Unless you like limp steamed potatoes with a pedestrian salad dressing upgrade I wouldn't' waste my money getting take-out or delivery from Brat Haus.  Granted at these prices they can afford the eco-friendly-biodegradable paper cartons they use to send you packing with to-go-food but they have no idea what a couple of small twists of a chef's knife will achieve on the top of a closed food box. If they had only vented my food so my $50 order wasn't soggy I may have another review.   I live two blocks away. Everything smelled delicious and adding parsley to Thousand Island Dressing is a nice but not an epic contribution to the culinary imagination I would bank my brand on.  A burger, Belgium Fries, a 32 oz growler of beer and one pint at the bar, while I waited is what...  $50?   I work for a living... I could have made this order at home and half of my bun would not have stuck to the roof of the box and disintegrated to a wet mush as the steam bath from the undercooked meats did their dark magic on a perfectly good bakery bun.  Both meat patties of the \"Pig-Mac\" burger were med-rare.. including the pork sausage, which was even more disgusting after I microwaved it to a safe temperature. I know of a west valley beer garden that is so much cheaper and prepared by real Germans that cook their pork sausage completely and safely the way it should be.   I have been wanting to stop in for months since moving back because I love German food and it is so close to my swanky old-town apartment. A great logo, great brand, street appeal but the dampf-haus is very short-sided, catering only to the naive kids that come in to get dogs and big steins of beer on their daddy's card have no idea about local demographics or take-out. They really need a kitchen make-over and some food safety training that only good food consultants can provide. I walked into the kitchen building when I first arrived and nobody was there but somebody's order getting cold so I went over to the bar looking for some service. I was mistaken, that being said, I say tschus.",

I did get some delish hard cider.  They also have unusual bottled sodas which are fun to try.  The bartender/waiter was extra nice - good service and someone you could tell cared about his job.  That was the good... unfortunately - that doesn't include any of the food.  The pretzel with cheese was just ok - didn't taste fresh and soft and the cheese sauce was very heavy on the swiss flavor and kind of bland.  We were excited to try the poutine - and VERY disappointed.  The gravy was bland and you could still taste the flour.  It was basically just a $10+ plate of trash.  Hubby had a brat - which he wasn't really impressed with.  I got the Pig Mac - I did like it but not enough to be able to convince hubs to return.  The inside seating is all high tops - and not particularly comfy.    Bottom line - this isn't a place for us - it's a place for people who love beer and horseshoes and don't mind sitting on uncomfy bar stools.  People for whom the food might be a second thought and maybe have beer goggles on while they are eating.",

The set up of a bier garden was great, however, the music they were playing is not at all of German music not to mention the huge colored mexican painting on the wall. Not cool and that threw it all off. Our waitress was great. She was always checking in on us. I would like to comment though that when a couple says \"we'll have one more\" that it means one more round of two beers, not just one beer. My wife's schnitzel sandwich was very good. Lots of flavor and very interesting. The garlic fries were great as everyone else mentioned. I ordered the brat with sauerkraut. The brat was just weird and dry. Nothing that reminded me of a German brat. The sauerkraut was extremely weird. I have never seen anything like that in my life. I even took a bit of the kraut alone just to see how it tasted. Didn't taste anything like kraut and I was disappointed. I only ate about 3/4 of my brat and that was enough disappointment. They need to fix this.  If you've been to Germany and even lived there, you may be disappointed.",

I like the Pig Mac, Schnitzel, pig tail poutine and pretty much everything I've tried. The deep fried ribs were one of the few misses I've had here.

My favorite thing about the Brat Haus though is the service. We are always treated very well. We did a private party for 22 people and paid the extra $20/ person for the all you can drink option. Well worth it. Also, everything is locally sourced and even the mustards are made from scratch. Try the Pig Mac. Incredible.",

The bacon party had so many other things mixed into it that I could not taste bacon. I would be willing to try again but order differently.",

    "text": "I'm glad to see that Chef Payton Curry was able to take his knowledge from working at various establishments around the valley (I fondly remember his time at Caffe Boa) and produce one exceptional eating establishment. I went here on a Friday, with my gang of regulars, who are one picky bunch, and they LOVED this place. The wait person knew her stuff, the service was quick and overall, the food was wonderful.   We started out with a pretzel and unlike what I get when I went to to Handlebar Grill, which are more like pretzel rolls, this was a real pretzel, though it seems made with whole wheat instead of white flour but got a big thumbs up from my culinary focus group. Even better, the establishment makes their own sauces and mustards so along with the obligatory beer cheese I had a wonderful whole grain mustard to use as well so it was like being back in Germany!  I and another person went for the lamb sausage and it was great! It was a good size and nestled in a chunk of soft  and chewy french bread, and I topped it with more of that wonderful mustard, along with sauerkraut and spicy peppers. The nice thing, the sausage was cooked but not overcooked so it was still juicy and it had a strong lamb flavor. As I noted before, unlike a softer bun the french roll bread held together to the end. Another person at my table had the rabbit sausage and said it was great and the last, the last person was a vegetarian and had the black bean burger and boy, it looked excellent! I would love to try that, once I've made it through all the sausages on the menu!  The only thing that stood out as needing work was what was referred to as Belgian fries, which are generally thick cut and twice fried for a crispy outside and creamy interior but these were more like shoe string fries. Chef Payton, work on those fries! if the fries rise to the level of actual Belgian fries I will happily give this place five stars. In this case, the Brat Haus may want to go check out the fries at Handle Bar and Grill, which are closer, from my perspective, to actual Belgian fries.  Bottom line, to quote the Terminator, I'll be back and next time, not on a work day so I can check out the beer selection I see so many other people raving about! :-)  By the way, if you like the sausages you can buy fresh ones to take home so you can grill your own.",

I love the ammo bins on wheels to sent condiments and napkins to the other members of your party. The rest of the interior design is great also. However, I do wonder if women had any input as the chairs have no backs and there are no purse hooks. Which means, my purse goes on the floor or the table. Either one is not appropriate.   However, the food was amazing. And I'm German. I started off with the basics. A pretzel and cheese. Beer brat.  WITH ROOTBEER ONIONS. And beer. And strudel. And I didn't get hungry again until the next morning (and that was lunch).   I really appreciated that the food was served on metal trays. It gave a little bit of extra flair. And I give extra points for the way management handled the patrons beside us that started off with a compliment and quickly turned to complaints.  The service was a little slow for being lunch on a weekday, and there were no purse hooks. So I'll be back, but will probably only bring my wallet in. Like a guy.",

    "text": "I would like to give this place 3 1/2 stars if possible so yelp please work on that. I'm not a regular here and I have only been here 3 times.  This review is on the sausages, pretzel, fondu and wannabe \"Belgian fries\".  1. Sausage 4 stars  All their sausages taste great, each different one has a unique flavor, they are fresh and taste great. Only downside I have is they are pretty damn small for what you pay.  2. Pretzel pronounced Preeh-tzell in Deutsch. 5 stars  Hands down the best German style pretzel I have ever had since I moved here to the US from Germany. Yea mustard is ok with it, but salted European butter would make it taste 10 times better. If you want it in bulk google German Deli and look up Laugen Brotchen.  The fondu on the other hand is something to be desired. My second biggest disappointment.  3. Trice fried \"Belgian Fries\" ...... 0  I had high hopes for Pommes Frites and was let down like Buffalo Bills fan of the 90's. Everyone knows that has visited or lived in Europe, that you only find real fries to be thick cut. Not like steak fries though. Yea you have your chain places and fast food restaurants that serve skinny fries from the freezer, but a good wurst stand will serve real fries. Thick cut, fried twice, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Something that will hold up to a good mayo or being drenched in curry ketchup. Every time I ordered it here, they were burned overly crispy and skinny like McDonald's fries.  Their beer selection is nothing to scoff at. Lots of beers to choose from even though again a little over priced.  Overall this place does great marketing, serves good to great food and is probably a place to be seen at for the Scottsdale \"in\" crowd. If my wallet allows me I'll be back for more brats, pretzel and beer, if I want a good German meal I will drive my ass to Haus Murphy's. Introduce a good Doner  Kebab and I will eat every time in town.  I'll be back Brat Haus AZ",

    "text": "If there's German food or beer in the Phoenix area, you better bet your bottom dollar I'll know about it.   I came here the day after it had opened and it was pretty slammed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. While we waited, we were able to go over to the bar area and get ourselves a beer. The beer list is so great, it took me 5 minutes to decide which one to get first. I started with a Bell's draft for the wait (I know, I know - getting an American beer at this place? But Bell's is the bees knees and not many places have them on draft so Brat Haus gets a big star for that).   Once we got seated, the waiter came over and was extremely friendly and attentive. Every time I go to a restaurant shortly after they open, there's usually always some hiccups - spotty service, out of certain menu items, etc., but that wasn't the case at all! Everything seemed to be running smooth like they'd been open for months already.   I got the spicy brat and the #5 Hefe for dinner. We also split fries and the pretzel. Hands down best pretzel I've ever had!   The ambiance is great, they have a beer menu to make even the most decisive person become an indecisive little girl, and the menu makes me want to keep coming back until I try everything.   Go here.",

And it was for Sam and Elmer. They probably didn't imagine their rabbit coming with sweet-onion relish, curry catsup or anything called an \"ailoli.\" Their loss.  My wife's lamb brat was just as good as my bunny (I hadn't eaten rabbit since I was something like 5 years old). And we had nary a quibble with the date cake for dessert. It was kind of like an Australian sticky-date pudding, and ranks as one of my favorite non-chocolate-based desserts. I have nothing bad to say about the beer selection, either.   Service? Enthusiastic, opinionated, fast. I love getting a server's honest opinion on their favorites and their suggestions (particularly good for deciding which topping to pair with your rattlesnake/duck/vegetarian bratwurst).",

    "text": "I reeeeaaaallly wanted to love this place. Maybe my expectations were just too high.  We went last night, it was quiet and our server was VERY ATTENTIVE. Which was a little much-there was at least one time that he reminded himself that he already asked us the same question, and he even would wait to watch my husband try his beer. Which, of course, I know is better than the alternative, but seriously he could've gave us a little space.   The brats were great but smallish portions. We got fries-good, and a salad-meh. The spinach salad was sold out, so we got the cobb and it was just so-so.  I guess I feel like overall the concept is giving mixed messages:  -brat haus is all about brats! no wait-beer! the name of the restaurant features food-brats specifically, but then the menu says they created the food to complement beer. The menu doesn't pair up food specifically with beer. It felt like it would be a good place known for drinking (like casey moores), but features a menu that reads like it's a restaurant.  -brat haus is relaxed and casual like a German oktoberfest but has small portions and nickles and dimes the customers. Obviously, this is a Scottsdale restaurant, but why not just adjust the prices and include a choice of side? You go in expecting a BRAT, but you get a brat swimming in a bun. You get one topping, but are charged 75 cents for each additional. Ching ching ching. You realize you need to order fries. Or a (meh) salad. Look, just up the prices and portions so people feel like they are getting fed, otherwise people are just going to keep being disappointed. I even heard people at the next table getting a big explanation about how blah blah blah the each additional dipping sauce...that kind of stuff doesn't make a great dining experience.  I am pretty sure I will try this place again, but I am going to give it a few months and let them work the kinks out.",

It happened to be in the mid-afternoon, and it was very quiet - in fact, I was the only one there.  So I had a chance to talk with the bartender, take my time looking at the different types of beer, and getting recommendations not just on beer, but also on the food,  It was obvious that the bartender loved talking about the beer.  He had full knowledge of the many different types they had, and made several recommendations. I tried two of them, and they were great.  My main reason for stopping was for a bratwurst.  He made several suggestions on the food, and I finally tried the Beer Bratwurst, with the Rootbeer Onions, Sauerkraut, Spicy Peppers, and Relish toppings. It was delicious. The bun was rather large and dry - but it was just right with all the toppings and the condiments I added.  Great place - the service was very good, the bartender very helpful, the food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. A great addition to Old Town!!",

Their beer selection was amazing: craft brews - most of them on draft but some options in a can as well. They carried some of our favorites: Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, Bells Two-Hearted, Dale's Pale Ale.  If I remember correctly, prices ranged from $5-8...not terrible and plenty of them were priced at the lower end of the range.They have a very short list of house cocktails (4 or 5) for the non-beer drinkers but I thought they sounded delicious and for a moment I was tempted to order a cocktail instead.  I ordered the Thai Brat with apricot onion chutney. I had been warned that it would be spicy since it contained sriracha but I like some heat so I ordered it anyway. The mix of sweet and spicy was nice, but I will admit that 3/4 of my way through it I had to hand the rest over to my husband -- too spicy. It was almost so spicy that I feared I was missing out on some really good flavors going on in there, but I still enjoyed it. He ordered the Spicy Brat with sauerkraut. The brat was not as spicy as the Thai brat but it was delicious. The bar was lined with ketchup, mustard, curry ketchup, honey mustard, whole grain mustard, and dijon mustard. My husband was happy because he used curry ketchup at home. I like regular ketchup so much that I normally don't use it but it was a nice addition to the Thai Brat.  Fries? A-MAZING! A small order was plenty to split but I could've eaten a large just because it's so hard to stop eating them. You are given a choice of about 8 dipping sauces. We had the bacon bleu-cheese, but all of the options sounded great so it was a tough choice.  We splurged and got dessert. We typically skip this last course, but I had to try the butterscotch root beer float. LOVED IT! Made with vanilla ice cream and Dang's Butterscotch Root Beer, very clever.   The service was great, the food was outstanding. There is something for everyone here. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I'm not a fan of beer but I do like a good beer brat - go figure. Considering there is not another brat place in town (that I know of anyway) the boyfriend and I were happy to find out about Brat Haus.   On a Saturday night we took a seat on the Brat Haus patio. the seating is a little weird. There are a few long group tables, a few individual tables and then a lot of empty space. It wasn't super busy which made the empty space seem even more, well, empty. Kinda weird.  We each ordered a traditional beer brat with root beer onions and an order of pretzels to share. The pretzels came out first. Man, those are some girthy pretzels. Not sure if they are whole wheat but they are much heartier that what you get at Auntie Anne's that's for sure. They came with 3 types of mustard and a beer cheese sauce. The cheese sauce was just okay. It was kinda thin and a little bland. The waitress did ask our opinion though and we told her what we thought. It was nice to know they are open to improvements and want customer feedback.  Next up were the brats. They are huge! After the filing pretzels we could have easily shared one brat. The bun was more like french bread, which made for a little too much bread around the meat. But i will say I'm not a big fan of onions and I really like the root beer onions. It was a very nice complement to the brat. The brat itself was good, not amazing but good. It also came with a few pickled green beans which were a surprising nice flavor combination with the meat.   Overall the staff was very nice, the food was decent and in the winter I think it'll be a great place to hang out outside. If you like beer and brats it's worth stopping by.",

Maybe I am just spoiled and used to a much more exotic selection of dogs, but even removing my prejudice.. These aren't that great.  3) Beer selection is decent. Nothing to write home.   Overall, I just think Brat Haus is missing that certain something.. Hopefully with time, they will improve.",

    "text": "LOVE LOVE LOVE!  The concept of this place is awesome, and so is the food! I think once the weather cools off it will become a regular place we stop by on nights out. First of all I thought that the two restaurants side by side and the back area with tables/chairs and decor was a cool concept. Also the prices were very reasonable, and the service was good too, seemed like a happy staff that wanted you to enjoy your time. We went on the launch of Oktoberfest and it was great... maybe because I love seeing guys dressed up in liederhosen, or maybe because the two man german band was so cool. Very traditional & they made us dance!   Here's the scoop on food + drink:   + San Tan Beers + Waffle Fries  + Beet Salad + Spicy Brat + Apple Strudel   We left happy and I got a picture next to the awesome Brat Haus van parked outside (coming soon, I'll add it to the photos).   We did eat outside even though it hadn't quite cooled off yet, but when I went inside it looked pretty awesome so we'll have to check that out next time. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I was teetering between rating this place a 3 or a 4, but went with the 4 because at the end of the day, I know we'll be back.  We stopped by Saturday night after a lonnnnnng day of home repairs. The hubs deserved some good eats, so we headed over to the Brat Haus, as my hubs is a lover of all thing meat. (Wait, that can come off in a bad way... nevermind. He loves dead animal. How about that?)  We arrived shortly after a massive rain storm had hit, and the sky was still pretty dark & grey. The hostess immediately went to serve us outside, and I asked \"What is the plan should it start to rain again?\" Her answer: \"Ummm... I guess just run as fast as you can inside.\" Cute. I'm 6 months pregnant. Not happening. I ask her if there is anything inside available - and she says no. I told her we'd wait. And she sort of huffed back to the hostess stand. Sorrrryyyyy for not wanting to get stuck in the rain.  We get back to the hostess area, and take a seat. We took a look and see how the place had changed from the Oregano's days. It was really neat! They took the parking area and created a large patio-type-seating place. Definitely would be great on a spring afternoon. As we were told that it'd be 15 minutes before we could be sat, imagine our surprise when moments later the hostess walked over and said, \"I just bused a table inside for you, so we are set.\" Hooray!  We walked inside, and to our surprise THERE WAS NO ONE SEATED INSIDE. Well, that's a lie, there were two couples. But there were about 15 seats available. Seriously? No seating inside? I get annoyed with bad service far more than I get annoyed by bad food.   So we sit. Our server pops over and explains the menu. Quite an interesting selection of Brats, and I was happy to see they had burgers & salads as well. The hubs ordered a beer (forgot the name) and I ordered a root beer. We also ordered a pretzel to split.  The pretzel came, and was HOT. Fresh out of the oven, which is awesome, however it was SO hot we couldn't eat it for about five minutes while it cooled. When it was cooled, we took bites and it was good! Not life changing, but it worked. The root beer was Dad's Rootbeer, served ice-cold out of the bottle. The hubs said his beer was 'thick'. I took his word for it, but he finished it & liked it.   For dinner, the hubs ordered the 'celebrity chef special' brat which that week was something by Justin Beckett, and I ordered a cheese burger. We also ordered a side of fries to split.  The food came quickly and was yummy. The hubs ordered his Brat with the rootbeer onions on top, which were OK, but he thinks he'll go a different direction in the future. My burger was awesome - perfectly cooked and the sides & sauces on top were perfectly mixed. The 'Hush Hush' sauce they put on top is basically a thousand island... or McDonald's 'Secret' sauce. Get it? Hush-Hush vrs Secret Sauce? Hilar.  The fries were good, and the sauce we had selected - the Blue Cheese Bacon - to dip them in was good. Kind of watery, but you definitely got a smoked bacon taste as you ate.  We were meeting friends for dessert or I would have been ALL OVER the shakes or floats I saw heading out of the kitchen.   We'll definitely go back and try more menu items... I'll just make sure not to have high expectations for the hostess staff. For now at least...",

The pretzels are always one of our starters... Little hard which I like for a bit more crunch. Good assortment of mustards, cheeses and even some Nutella for dipping.

We got the house brat, a pretzel, some Belgian fries, a vegan burger, a couple of beers, and another pretzel with nutella for dessert. Everything was decent but not life-changing. Prices were a little bit on the high side. There was a decent (but not huge) imported beer selection. One plus was that they have a wide variety of sauces, mustards, and ketchups which are interesting and fun to try with the pretzels and fries. One a side note, this is a vaguely German-inspired pub, not a place for authentic traditional German food.    However, if you are looking for a fun place to hang out with friends, then this place is perfect. They have a huge outdoor patio area with a bunch of games to play (extra-large Jenga, ping-pong, etc.).  Most importantly, we weren't pressured to keep ordering.  My wife and I got our food and one drink each, ate, then spent an hour nursing our beers and playing Jenga and the waitstaff never made us feel uncomfortable about it.",

For a sunday afternoon, it was kinda slow but the ambience inside was pretty cool. We were seated at the large table, which could seat about 15, even though there were only 5 of us. There were a lot of beer choices and I decided to order the raspberry beer, which is amazing! The size of the glass was pretty small for $8 but still a great beer!  We ordered the pretzel appetizer and loved them! The pretzels were huge and the dipping sauces were great! I We also ordered the Belgian fries with sirracha and ranch for dipping. There are other dipping sauce options but those were the ones we chose. In the middle of our table, there were bottles of ketchup, mustard and other arranged sauces. Fries were good, nice they left the skin on them! My mom and sister ordered the field greens salad as well and I was able to taste it. I personally didn't like the dressing (too bitter) but my mom and sister liked it. The greens, veggies and toppings in the salad were good just not the dressing.  For lunch, I ordered the turkey sausage with apple & sage. I chose the apricot and onion chutney as my topping. I loved the chutney and was also able to try my mom's root beer onions, which were good. The sausage was tasty, just not a fan of the pieces of mustard seeds I got throughout the brat. The bread was really delicious, nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside. I didn't feel like it was too big for the brat, which has been a critique I've noticed in other reviews.  For dessert, they brought out the drunken cake. It was a generous portion of cake and it tasted good. We also ordered the soft serve ice cream and the butterscotch root beer float. I was pretty disappointed with the \"soft serve\" because they didn't have chocolate ice cream and the ice cream wasn't soft serve. The texture was off but still tasted fine. Not worth the $3.50 though! The float was also a big hit as well!  Overall, I would come back and try a different sausage and a different beer. Prices are a tad high but for Scottsdale, that's really not unusual. Everyone in my party enjoyed the food too!",

The ambiance is casual and not too raucous - a good antidote to some of the high octane bars up the street.  Filled with a non-trendy, mixed-age crowd, the BH seems more akin to a downtown Phx joint - vaguely but unoppressively hipster.  The menu sounded enticing but overall the food was a bit lackluster. I ordered  charcuterie plates of goat cheese, sliced pears and pee pollen, and a cheddarwurst brat.  My boyfriend had a burger. All the food was dry - even the pears.  Prices are reasonable however servings are small.  The service was perfect - friendly, attentive, efficient: an A+.    Brat Haus provides an outdoor eating/drinking experience different from other downtown Scottsdale restaurants and bars. I'll be back to give the food another shot.",

For lunch I had the spicy brat and sweet peppers. For dinner the chorizo sausage and chutney. You can't go wrong on either the basic or premier sausages, but if you're unsure what to try go for a sweet/spicy combo. Like the spicy brat and a sweet topping, or sweet brat and spicy toping. If you like sauerkraut, it's all homemade (like the sausages) so give it a try. If you don't like sauerkraut, you're a strange person and should probably not go to a bratwurst house. And I feel bad for you. I'm sorry.  Where was I... oh yes, their belgian fries are great, and I am a fan of the sriracha aoli dipping sauce. Of course, they pretty much had me at \"sriracha\".   Their beer list is very well rounded. I'm not a huge fan of belgians and german beer, so was a little worried, but there is plenty of great beer there to drink across the whole spectrum. Chatted up Ben The Beer Baron for a while, and he definitely knows his stuff. Don't be shy about asking him for recommendations.",

Service- Every time we went there it was busy and we received very good service and our servers were knowledgeable about the beer.  Speaking of beer:  2. Beer- Hands down best beer selection in Old Town! They also make a killer Moscow Mule =)  3. Belgiun Fries- Come on, trice fried fries... how can you go wrong! I also love all their sauce options.   4. The atmosphere- Perfect spot in Old Town, especially now that it is cooling down.  I also love the graffiti mural on the wall, the owner said they will be randomly having local artist paint the wall. Great idea!   The forgettable:   1. Pretzel - its okay, nothing special, I was expecting it to knock my socks off... they stayed on!  2. Vegan- While I am very grateful of them having a vegan option, it was tasty but very hard to eat because it kept falling apart... they need to work on making a vegan brat!   My friends love this place, so we'll be back for sure.  One day I'm going to try their nutella shake... or steal their giant container of Nutella... Mmmmm!",

People will pay it so why not charge it. We are outside and it was a nice atmosphere, but that wasn't enough for me. I had a brat and it was decent, but to be honest I've had better that I've made myself. The hamburger order was wrong that they brought me the first time. They brought me the right burger and it was decent, but not worth the price tag. Their garlic fries on the other hand were pretty delicious.",

    "text": "Grew up in Germany and saw this place on Yelp. Decided to try it while I was in Tempe for training. I was torn between the schnitzel and Currywurst. I don't get Currywurst very often, so that was what I ordered. Sat inside the bar area. The bartender had excellent customer service skills. Made me feel like I was a regular (it was obvious there were many regulars and I could see why). Currywurst was pretty good. Although I'm a bit partial cuz nothing beats going to any downtown city in Germany and ordering Currywurst from a stand. It was good though... I also ordered the Nutella cheesecake to go; it was awesome! It's a shame I don't drink beer cuz they had an extensive list of beer on draft. Location was nice... Downtown Scottsdale right next door to another bar. They have outdoor seating that makes you feel like you're in a beer tent in Germany. I'm back in town next week, and I'll be sure to come back to try the schnitzel!",

They have several sauces for you to enjoy with your fries and I'd recommend their Hush Hush and Sriracha Aioli sauces.  They comped a slice of their Drunken Date Cake to us and that was awesome!!!  Service was good and seating was difficult, but we opted to sit \"community style\" at a large table amongst other patrons.  Had fun meeting new people.  Will have to try a brat the next time.",

The pretzel I ordered was a little dry, but I appreciated the artisan quality it had - not your usual SuperPretzel hanging from a metal rod above a light bulb.  As another person mentioned, the food isn't your traditional German style. They're pulling inspiration from German fare, but creatively altering it to make it an enjoyable culinary experience.  If this place lowered it's beer prices a little (wink wink), it'd steal a lot of traffic from Tempe, me thinks. :)  I think this place is the choice for a date if you both want to drink beer with dinner. You also have Scottsdale to play around in afterward.",

My kid had this amazing Vanilla Jellybean Soda, and my beet salad and pretzel were awesome!  My hubby liked his burger and fries.  We were planning on brats for dinner so we had to pass on them for lunch.  It will be on the list the next time we visit.  Disappointing were the mustards, really.  For a German themed restaurant, bland mustards are NOT the way to go.    The bonus was that we got to meet one of the owners.  To be fair, it was the first week it opened so they were very active in the operations.  I don't think that will last much longer if it is still going on.  Our server was a little odd... made for a couple uncomfortable interactions.  He wasn't horrible, just odd.  I think we got an incorrect beer too - hubby is a professional brewer and I have worked in craft beer and wine for almost 10 years, we kinda know our beers.  BUT we are totally going back and we are totally sitting in the beer garden.  Parking stinks though.  Just know you will be parking a little ways away.",

I can head to the Pork Shop or Spouts and get a brat just as good, if not better. The meat to bread ratio is off and the specialty brats did not stand out. The highlight here were the fries. They were by far the standout of our meal.",

On the plus side, the manager dropped by unbidden and graciously replaced her meal with another very quickly when she commented on it.

    "text": "A bunch of us went to Brat Haus for my buddy's birthday as what better way to ring in your special day than with brats and cold beer with friends??? We decided to sit outside in their \"beer garden\", so I can't really speak to the decor of the place. The patio area is a nice size with several very large picnic-style tables. Not exactly wow factor, but then again we're talking about bratwurst, not Beluga...  It wasn't crowded, so we had our choice of where to sit. It looks like there is an outdoor bar, too, but it wasn't open that night.   The beer list gets an 'A' from me. It's pretty much all craft beers and they have plenty on tap and in bottles. Nice variety of styles and regions represented. The prices seemed reasonable for many of the selections (I went with a domestic pilsner that was $5/pint). However, some of the beer options can get spendy, but I like that they offer something for everyone. If you want wine, well, go find another restaurant. Who drinks wine with brats anyway??   Which brings us to the food... Some items were very good, others were just so-so. Sadly the so-so food happened to be the main attraction on the menu.   I tried the beer brat, the kosher beef dog, and the chicken sausage with roasted chiles. Of the three, the brat was the best, but that's just winner by default because the other two were so average. The seasonings were solid, but they all seemed dry. And all the toppings on the menu really don't matter much when the meat underneath is dry.    However, the Belgian fries were great. Crispy, but not burnt, with just the right amount of salt. The dipping sauces I tried were all good, save for the 'Hush Hush Sauce'. Skip that unless you like incredibly average 1000 Island Dressing. I'd go with the bleu cheese & bacon sauce, the sriracha aioli, or the white truffle aioli (it's pretty mild).   Another food winner were the pretzels. Two very large, hearth-baked soft pretzels with a three cheese dipping sauce. Plenty to share (or you can just choose to keep all that warm pretzel goodness to yourself). They also have stone ground mustard which was excellent with these.   As for the service, it was great. We had two servers attending to us and they were never away for long. They offered solid advice on the beer list (i.e. beer sommeliers) and also gave some honest opinions on the food.   Was the experience OK overall? Yes it was, but I can't really give them higher than 3 stars due to the fact they are the 'BRAT Haus' and I felt the brats & sausages were really just average. If I could rate them on other items alone, then they'd get 4 stars from me.   Will I be back? Yeah, probably, but I'll order the pretzels and a beer. Hey, sometimes it's the simple things...

I went to Brat Haus for a friend's birthday who is a beer fanatic; it was perfect in that sense. The server asked perfect questions to know exactly what kind of beer we would like, and made great recommendations. The food to me was so-so. I like sausage just fine, I just wasn't a huge fan of the toppings. I ordered the brat sliders, which came with a sample of 3 brat's with 3 different toppings. I was disappointed. The saving grace for Brat Haus in my eyes was their hot pretzels with cheese (AMAZING), beer and the \"hush hush sauce.\" I also ate a few French fries whom a friend had ordered and they were good. I'd highly recommend this place for a casual dinner, birthday party, or for someone who loves German beer. The prices are great too!",

The garlic fries were very good and probably the best thing we ordered.   We sat outside on a nice Sunday afternoon and was great with a huge patio area.  As for the hush hush sauce it is a variation of thousand island.   We did not have their specialty items - pretzels,  beer or brats.   Overall I liked the idea but seemed like it was a bit missing.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Brat Haus forever, but with so many choices in old town, I hadn't gotten here until today. Well... Now I can say... been there; done that; never again. I met my brother there for a late lunch--it was mediocre at best. Tables in the bar area were sticky dirty and ones in other building not set for service. We sat in the bar building and just avoided putting elbows on table. Lol. (The menus were also filthy with dried mustard and other debris.) We should have left then and gone somewhere that values its customers more. But, undeterred yet, we persevered. To start, we shared a pretzel. It was okay--large but nothing special. There are lots of mustard choices on the table, but most of the house made ones had a weird aftertaste to them. Next, I had the sausage board and my brother ordered a beef dog, as he doesn't generally eat pork. The server brought him sausage by mistake. She was very apologetic and offered to replace with a hot dog, but my brother kept it when he confirmed they would have to throw the sausage out. (He doesn't like to see animal products wasted.) The sausage board was good--each served atop a relish/picked veg. We also shared an order of fries. They were decent but, again, nothing special. Although the server was pleasant, service was pretty awful considering how tiny the place is. At one point, I spilled half my soda. The mess of soaking wet napkins and ice sat in the middle of our table for about 15 min before we could get the bartenders attention to take it away. She never brought fresh napkins, despite asking three times, until my brother went to the counter to get them. (Beware, if you need extra, the replacements are bathroom paper towels.) Finally, we didn't ask for a comp, and my brother did eat the sausage, but it certainly would have been good business to acknowledge the screwup even a bit on the bill, but of course not. All in all, a disappointing experience. Really not sure what the hype is. There are so many fabulous restaurant choices in town, I'd advise picking somewhere else.",

Next, our group ordered Curry Wurst, the Haus Brat and a Beet salad. The food came in a timely manner and the music, although far from authentic, was keeping us entertained. Unfortunately it was quite a slow tonight (Saturday) but the Reissdorf Koelsch Kolsch made up for it. The waitress was very friendly and accommodating, and promptly responded to our requests for extra beers and food. The beer garden is an awesome setup and I can imagine this being a very fun place to hang out with a larger group or on a busier night.  Hope to return in the future. Great experience",

I very rarely don't tip, as I have been a server, but when you don't work the table you don't get a tip. Because of the host we will be back and hopefully the service will be on point.

I hate to say bad things but the food was not that good.  My wife and I had the salted pretzel which I thought was sort of small for 2 people and we ran out of cheese sauce very quickly.  Definitely need more cheese sauce.  For our main course we both had the pork snitzel.  I served in the military, and I was stationed in Germany  so I have had good pork snitzel.  This was very average and did not have much flavor.  It was a bit tough and not very juicy.  Kind of dry to be honest and the fries were very greasy.  The service was excellent though thats why I was generous with the 3 stars.  Will probably look for a different place when we want German food.",

I love that they give you the option to pick your brat as well as the toppings that go on it. I got the standard haus sausage with the sweet onion jam and the sweet and spicy peppers. The jam was delicious but they really mean spicy with the peppers! I had to scrape off the remaining sweet and spicy peppers so beware if you can't handle heat; it's not a subtle kick. It'll get you! I do recommend coming here if you're in the area as it's something you can't really find anywhere else!",

We love the food choices and the beer selection!!  So many options and they change seasonally so we don't get into a rut.  Keep that up! What needs work is the service.  Each time service has been slow and items are always missing.  One time the check even came slow so others in our party had to leave and we had to stay and keep waiting!  Each time we have been there the restaurant has not been full so it's hard to say it was because of that!  On the last visit we were with a large group so the 20% was auto added so we felt shortchanged on service in this case.   We will try again because we love your food and beers....... please help with the service And you will be awesome!",

We stopped in on a cool night, so we sat indoors, but if you're there in the summer time or when it's warm, definitely aim for the patio! There's often live entertainment, games and a very social atmosphere out there.  We tried the Rattlesnake chili (free with check in!) and one of the pretzels with beer cheese. The apps were great, and the chili has a smokey kick that as a southern, BBQ-loving girl, I totally appreciate! The spicy brat with peppers was HOT, as expected and hoped for, and made me even more grateful for the tall, cold beer I enjoyed with it!   This place is ideal for getting together with friends (lots of group seating outside), or for a quick bite before a movie or stroll through old town with your significant other. I can't wait to come back for the dog-friendly Sunday night special!",

The staff was very friendly and attentive (even when everyone had had a bit too much of the open bar included in the package).   The giant appetizer pretzels with some sort of cheese dip were great and the pig was beautiful and succulent. The chefs were very forthcoming when presenting the pig and it made the occasion very memorable. Dessert was just okay but by that point, we were too full to appreciate anything more they brought our way.   I would definitely recommend a private party pig roast if you love pork and have a special occasion to celebrate.",

We actually almost ordered the same thing again, since it was so delicious last year.  We started with the in-house made pretzel and cheese dip, and I had a Chimay Cinq Cents and my wife ordered the Wethenstephan hefe since she likes lighter beers.  Both were miraculous to me!  We then followed up with ordering the brat flight, three mini sliders on buns including the Haus brat, topped with sauerkraut, the spicy brat topped with root beer sauteed onions, and the sweet brat topped with spicy red peppers.  Add one of the many choices of mustards in the six pack we had on our table, and you have perfection!  The flight included 4 oz. beers to accompany each slider, and all were perfect pairings.  The bartender Judy had the dining room and bar all to herself and she was friendly, warm and attentive and it was amazing to watch her multi-task.  One again a visit to the Brat Haus was a highlight of our vacation and since we are staying in the area for two weeks once again, we will probably be back next week!  So different and fun with all of the beer and brat choices!  We went early so parking on the street was easy.  (Last year we had a hike going later at night and had to park around the corner illegally 8-})",

After we we sat there was about a 10 minute delay between sitting down and having our drink order taken and then another 10 minutes to get the beers which were not ice cold, more like chilled and on the way toward room temperature. After this the service picked up and the food was delivered to our table in an expected amount of time (10-15 minutes).  The brats were delicious  along with the wide selection of Mustard to go with the Garlic Fries which were demolished.  All in all the evening cost about $80 for three of us, so for some brats and beer it is on the high side but that is to be expected of Old Town Scottsdale, I will probably be back to give some of the other brats and pretzels a try.",

I ordered the schnitzel and it comes out in 3 smaller pieces instead of one big piece like its supposed to and i felt as if i were back in elementary school getting those generic chicken patty sandwhiches. I also asked the waitress for alot of lemon because thats how i eat my schnitzel. She comes back with 4 lemon wedges. I use all the wedges in a matter of a minute and i ask for more and the waitress got a bit snippety. Not to mention she never ever refilled our glasses. She came by about 4 times after we got our meal and never addressed our empty glasses. Also got the garlic fries with ranch. Terrible decision. They were literally average fries with chopped garlic clove on top. Absolutely no taste other than the garlic burn when i got a chunk of it in my mouth. The ranch dip was absolutely disgusting. Didnt even taste like ranch. In fact everyone in my party ordered a different sauce and they were all bad. The aioli and blu cheese bacon sauces were atrocious. A few people ordered the schnitzel sandwhich and they said it was really nothing special. Could've made a better sandwhich at home. The only decent item was Das Brat and thats giving it the benefit of the doubt. The only reason I'm  giving this a second star is because i got full off it.",

My daughter had the apricot onion chutney on top of her brat and that was excellent too. The fries were great and we all tried different drinks (beers and yummy concoctions that were fun). The service was great too. It is tricky to get a parking spot but I lucked out and parked on the street right in front of the place....that earned this place five stars in my book. I will be back.",

After being seated we waited for 10-15 minutes for the waiter to greet us, 30 min later we finally got our first beer, no apologies from the waiter and an hour later we got the food. Second beer order took just as long...   Apple pie was as bad as it can be, we had to return it. I have to say my friend has never returned food in her entire life.  Chicken was deep fried - German authentic food is never deep fried however it is an German expired place, please keep in mind its NOT GERMAN FOOD! Fries were decent so 2 stars for that!",

Granted, we are spoiled with great beer and brats being Chicagoans... so take this with a grain of salt.",

    "text": "I lumped Payton Curry in the same category as some of the other notable chefs who open and closes restaurant every 3 months. Even hearing how he supposedly stole the logo from the bike shop down the street fueled my displeasure. As someone who is in the industry, I was hating on the game which is an unwritten rule of the industry. So I hated Brat Haus before it even opened.  This past Thursday I was able to leave work early and meet my wife for dinner in Scottsdale. We decided to check out Brat Haus. I'm just going to talk about the food because that is what impacted me the most. Now, that damn Pig Mac has to be the single greatest creation in Arizona Culinary history. It was meaty, moist, flavorful and downright grubtastic. I literally have been thinking about when will I have the next chance to have the Pig Mac. The fries were killer with crispy tips that crunch like chips. The Thai sausage had great flavor but in my opinion could have been spicier but I love spicy foods. The unfiltered Hefe they have on tap was awesome. Everything was top notched from the seating in the bar to the sesame seeded burger buns.  In Summary, I have to eat dry chicken (crow). I was absolutely wrong about Payton Curry and his food. This chef can throw down. I will be back to partake in the heavenly creation of the Pig Mac. All hail the Pig Mac.  Chef, if you see some variation of the pig mac on my menu please don't sue me...LOL",

    "text": "Coooooool place!  I loved it the moment we walked in.  Another late night dinner for us on our road trip, my friend and I found this place in downtown Scottsdale, and enjoyed some tasty beers and dinner with a German flair.  I had the Moroccan lamb brat with sauerkraut and mango chutney upon our server's recommendation- delicious!  Very nice combination of flavors.  I also had a side of Belgian fries with chipotle mayo dip, also very good, nice and crispy on the outside, but thickly cut, and soft and potato-y on the inside.  Portions were big-- I would say you could split a small order of the fries between 2 people and be satisfied. My friend ordered the schnitzel, which came with home fries, so we were not short of taters!  We also had no idea how big everything would be, so we also ordered the beet salad, which they kindly split into 2 portions for us.  This was big too!  Easy to split between 3-4 people if you just want this a small appetizer salad, although I was grateful for the generous portioning, as it was a very nice salad- the beets were sweet and cooked just right, and they had a nice, warm, melty flavor.  Nice ambience outside with the hanging lights.  I really enjoyed our dinner here, and would easily come again if I'm ever in the area to try some other dishes.  Service was top notch, and prices were very reasonable.",

One of them took several pics with her cell phone.  Our food came quick, but later when the place was filling up I could see it was taking longer.  Menu selection is pretty limited and lacking many German dishes one expects to see at a German restuarant in the U.S., like black forest anything (ham, cake).  No studel.  Just basically sausages.  The cabbage soaked in a bit of vinegar is a far cry from sauerkraut,  The music was not too loud, very easy to have a conversation across the table, there was no rap or disco, sort of a pop golden oldies mix.  The beer selection was good.  Recommend this place for relaxed atmosphere, an appetizer and a beer during happy hour, then move on for dinner...",

Took advantage of the Yelp check-in freebie and got a soft pretzel with free Nutella dip. Wow! I usually don't like sweets with beer but this was one of the best pretzels I've ever had. Nice dark, chewy crust with melt-in-your-mouth softness inside. Tried the regular brat with sauerkraut topped with whole grain mustard and fries on the side. I am not a big brat eater or even a fan of sausage in general because I don't like running into the unchewable, gristly parts. There was no such thing in this brat! Unfortunately, I chowed down so much during happy hour, I had to go straight home and visit the couch. I would have given them 5 stars but right now with the construction, the parking is a bit of a mess unless you have no problem parking across Scottsdale Road in the lot. Bonus that you can take home brats or pretzels to enjoy later. I hope to go back very soon!",

The bread to meat ratio was about 3 to 1 and that does not make for a good sandwich.  The belgian fries were also a bit disappointing.  Fine flavor-wise but they were all only about a 3/4 inch to 1 inch long.  Very strange, especially considering the focus on dipping sauces.  You could not dip them without getting your fingers in the sauce.  Sevice was OK, atmosphere more of a bar than a restaurant.  Overall not worth the drive.",

You must sit outside before it gets too hot.  Absolutely awesome outside area, large tables, plenty of room it really gives off a beer-garden vibe.  Our waitress was all over it and never missed a beat, she was obviosuly very busy but our drink levels never dipped below halfway before she was back asking if we were ready to try another beer.  She was very knowledgeable of the different beers and menu items to pair them with and offered up samples of beer.  The atmosphere was very comfortable / casual for Scottsdale.  We only had apps with our many beers,   pretzels with cheese  dip, ribs and the brat sliders that we had were amazing.  Everyone in our group was having such a great time we hated to leave for our dinner reservations at Barrio- next time we are staying for dinner!  We are all fans and will be back,  if we didn't live on the Westside we would be here every Friday for the Happy Hour and fun atmosphere!  Great place with awesome food and the waitress we had was outstanding!  The Brat Haus hit all the marks on service, food and ambiance.",

    "text": "Service didn't seem to be the strongest suit of Brathaus, at least for my first visit as a party of one.   Originally I was given my choice of seating in the outdoor area, only to be asked to move because I had been led to a spot that had been reserved by a large group. No biggie, I'll just slide over somewhere else. After not getting any attention for upwards of 10 minutes, I headed for a seat at the bar.   The gentleman at the host station ended up taking care of my first beer as an apology for the lack of attention when I was first seated. So points for that.   I have to give Brathaus a lot of credit for an impressive beer list - by no means am I a beer snob, but I appreciate a place that has a number of things I've never tried as well as a good selection of local brews.   The brat slider sampler hit the spot and seemed to be a decent indication of what they offer. I certainly wasn't disappointed with the food, even though it was a limited sampling. The pretzel was also tasty as well as serving as a sponge for my beer intake.   I'm a bit torn on Brathaus because I think the core product is good but there are some hiccups with service and what was brought out. I saw several beers sent back over questions of quality, and while I understand that restaurants are inherently chaotic, this one seemed to show its chaos more than other places I have been. Maybe I caught them between shifts or just a bit off their game, and I'm willing to forgive that because as I mentioned, I think their core product is pretty good.   As they say, you never get a second chance to make a first impression, but I think I'd be willing to give Brathaus another chance. They salvaged a rocky start well, and delivered the goods for which they are known. There's no doubt that it has an appeal, especially for the younger set who want to hang out and hook up in the courtyard once the sun goes down. But for an often single diner in the increasingly competitive Scottsdale and Phoenix metro market, I did leave wondering if it would be a place to which I would return.",

Beer was tapped, and the wait staff was constantly asking if we wanted wine or any other hard liquor served in glass outdoors.

Set back off Scottsdale Road among the few trees and twinkly lights, and a really large Mexican mural, are a handful of tables, high tops and long picnic tables for guests. Considering the location of Brat Haus, I think they did a reasonable job in setting the scene.  As far as the food & drink go, you can expect regular german fare like brats, pretzels, potato salad, etc... and a wide variety of beer. My man had the hefeweisen, recommended by our sweet server, and the bartender was able to make me a radler - beer and lemonade mixed together! Splendid!  To start we ordered the house-made pretzel that came with yummy sauces. While we waited for our rounds of food we played with the giant Jenga game they had - so much fun! After we snacked on the soft, yet crunchy pretzel our mains arrived. I had the house brat and my man had the moroccan brat, both were juicy and flavorful. We both got the root beer onions as toppings. The onions were extremely sweet, so much that I couldn't finish mine. Next time I would just go with the sauerkraut.  Overall, a lovely and refreshing experience.",

I ordered their lemonade,mind you it's hot  so I chugged it and  she actually asks if I want a refill, Ya think? After that ordeal the food comes out I got the schnitzel sub, well they really should rename it to the schnitzel SUBpar because it was bland and not even their curry ketchup sauce could save it. It wasn't the worst but most definitely forgettable. Unless you're drinking I would just skip this place. Should've gone with my instinct and stuck to oreganos, at least their food has flavor!",

    "text": "Based off of food and atmosphere I was going to give this place three stars. I ordered the spicy brat (not actually spicy at all...) and garlic fries. While they were both decent, they were not worth the price they charged. If your restaurant is called BRAT Haus, you better have some better than average brats, which they don't.  The reason I gave this place two stars is because at the end of the meal the waitress brought out all our separate checks. One of my friends left a $10 bill to cover his meal and tucked it in with our credit cards, then he left because he had to go home. When the waitress came back with our credit cards, before she set the checks back down on the table, she says \"oh and your friend who left didn't pay so I don't know how you want to figure out how to pay for him....\" We were all confused because he is not the type of guy to do that and we asked \"are you sure he didn't pay with cash?\" and she replied \"no, it looked like he hadn't even touched his check.\" Anyway, we all agreed we would cover his portion, but then when we opened our credit card holders we found his money that he had placed in there with his check. This was definitely just an honest mistake on her part --- BUT before you go accusing a customer of walking out on a check wouldn't you double check the credit card holders to look for his receipt?? And she never apologized when we pointed out his money had been there the whole time. It's just plain rude.",

    "text": "I leek the feel of this place especially in the patio area. It's comfortable and very social as it's festival \"bench seating\" style but you must be seated by a greeter which is not a problem. the staff is very nice knowledgeable about the food they sell and the beer they serve. I Love to stop by in the day time and enjoy non-crowded parking which is the only issue I have with the location. \"limited parking\". My impression of what makes this place keep going is the local workers in the area and that they can walk to this after work without the parking hassle (do you get that I'm not happy with the parking yet?)  Anyway, to the  food, I love brat sausages. These were really good. I was impressed with the chorizo brat? the unusual side condiments are fun.   Today I ordered the \"das brat\" with sauerkraut and was disappointed that  I was served cold sauerkraut and had to send it back to have them heat it up (without hassle I might ad) and they brought it back warmed up nicely. It was fantastic!",

    "text": "UPDATE: I received a message from the owner, Dave. He said that the Brat Haus is NOT considered a German restaurant. \"We're a simple urban beer garden with a European influenced menu\"  and that Yelp mistakingly has it classified that way and refuses to change it. Ummm... ok.... Do you think somehow the name of the restaurant might have caused a little bit of that confusion? right?  Several of us rode to Scottsdale on our bikes and wound up at the Brat Haus for lunch. It's the only place around that wasn't too crowded, requiring a long wait. I was looking forward to eating lunch here because I am German and love German restaurants and atmosphere. I ordered the bottled root beer and beer brat with sauerkraut. The bottled root beer tasted authentic (duh), but the cooked brat, tasted dry, flavorless and was surprisingly small for the price. Yet, the bun was so wide, I could hardly put the whole thing in my mouth. I had to lift the little wiener off the bun to hunt for the saurkraut (sad).  After finishing my meal, I quietly announced that I was still hungry, only to find out that others at our table felt the same way. I've never left a restaurant hungry and always have to take a doggy bag. More food for the price please!!  Someone with us ordered a $10 beer in a small, stemmed glass. No thanks. We all know she didn't take any of that home with her. :-)  The atmosphere on the Brat Haus patio is far from authentic. Where's the German (polka) music? I don't remember hearing any music at all. Why aren't the waitresses wearing cute, sexy dirndls or lederhosen?! Where are the colorful hanging flowers that adorn the German patios and windowsills? The only thing that is truly authentically German at the Brat Haus is the way the tables are pushed together on the patio allowing total strangers to end up eating next to each other, like in Germany. What a disappointment!  I sincerely hope the owner does some much needed research on running a German restaurant or this place won't be in business long...sorry for my honesty.",

The pretzel was great, although we agreed that next time we should have shared.  We tried a couple of the sausages, I had a bite of each since I was so stuffed from everything else.  The lamb and the chorizo sausages are winners, again, those were great recommendations.  I can't wait to come back and try some other goodies.",

Brat Haus has darts, ping pong, and a variety of other outdoor games that you can play while waiting for your food to get done, and they also have a dog-friendly policy which leads to even more mid-meal entertainment.  The restaurant also has daily events, from \"dogs eat free\" days (they seem to have sausages for the dogs as well!) to movie nights.  The food is also killer, and although I didn't try any drinks while here, they also seem to have an extensive beer list as well.  We had an original pretzel with cheese, a sample of the rattlesnake chili (tastes awesome when used as a dip for the pretzel!), and a sweet brat, which is topped with sweet onions and apple (consider adding the root beer onions for more sweetness!).  Delicious.  This is definitely not your standard \"hot dog\" place.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "Might be the worst pretzels this side of whatever river runs through Germany. I nearly had to send my free pretzel back to the kitchen, but we had a bigger controversy with the cheese cup. At the YELP event, free pretzel coupons were handed out and normally a pretzel automatically comes with cheese, but in this case if you order a pretzel it is $5 and with cheese $6. Now if you just wanted a side cup of cheese it is $2.50. Yeah, your pricing needs some updating and a reality check, so waitress tried charging me the $2.50, instead of just a buck for the cheese. After I resisted, she decided to just take the cheese off the bill, so I won that battle. They have added non German beers, but the taps taste funny and my Oatmeal stout tasted off. The outdoor area is still a good place to chill, but the indoor bar smelled musty and perhaps the funniest moment ever was when some college kid came wandering in and said he left his ID here a few weeks ago. They still had it stashed away, now they just need to learn how to make a pretzel. These guys were not able to make tacos (RIP Taco Haus), so a bad pretzel I suppose was too be expected. The ones at the YELP event were hideous.",

We took his suggestion and took the little golf cart shuttles from our hotel to the Brat Haus.  SO HAPPY!!  We had been there before, years ago, when it was a pizza place (different owners).  The BH made the old parking lot between their two bldgs an awesome outside seating are.  There is tetherball, live size Jenga, corn hole...PLENTY to keep the kiddos and grown up kiddos busy!   On Sunday's they do Brats, Beer, and B movies on a huge outside screen.  Would have loved to see this!!  Next trip.  Now, the food...WOW.  We had several people so we sampled almost everything on the menu.  Everything was fantastic!  Shout out to the root beer onions, the date cake (trust me, try it!!) and the piggy(?) sandwich (pork burger)!  YOU  MUST get the Belgain fries!!  My husband prides himself on being a pork aficionado  and he was blown away by EVERY brat...the beers were awesome too!  20-30 on tap varieties!  if you can't find one you like.. :(  boo hoo for you:(  good thing they have wine, cocktails and non alcoholic beverages!  But OMG, the PRETZELS!!!  YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY!  I wanted to bring them home to freeze!  I haven't had a pretzel that good, EVER, even in Germany!!    The ambiance was casual, fun, welcoming!  The staff attentive and top notch!  Prices were super reasonable and you will be thrilled with the value!  Using the local climate that pleases (until July) it is the perfect venue for almost anything that isn't \"fancy\".  I recommend this for groups, families, celebrations of all kinds.  There were 2 b'day parties, a going away party when we were there.  OOH, and the short bus out front is the cutest sign ever!   TOP family pick of our week!",

    "text": "We saw all the high ratings, and gave it a try.  We thought it was more of a German Restaurant-Pub. It turned out to be a bar, with very uncomfortable seating and some \"German\" themed foods.  Both me and my Stepdad were very disappointed.  My food has no seasoning, tasted gross  and was cold.   There was no salt or pepper anywhere  to be seen,  and the overworked bartender was serving all the alcohol in the place, while trying but failing,  to provide service to those eating in the bar area.  The so-called German potato salad was fingerling potatoes, cabbage, bacon bits and mustard seed, without any dressing or flavor other than the heavy smoke of the bacon, that I could detect.  I couldn't get the over-smoked bacon taste out of my mouth for hours.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  My Stepdad tried to talk to the bartender about the four German draft beers on thier list, and was pretty much blown off, if not insulted.  He was told one beer he mentioned wasn't even a German beer, in no uncertain terms with a snotty tone.  The bartender was more in a hurry to get back to talking to his tatooed twenty-something pals sitting at his bar, than to welcome us or help us select a beer.   The food took a very, very long time to come out, and I had to take my card up to the bar to finally get  a check and get the heck out of there.  We were never asked how we liked the beer or the food.  I have no idea what some see it this place.  To me it was lousy food, lousy service, with an arrogant attitude and very uncomfortable.  We haven't enjoyed a meal less in a very long time.",

I had a malbec, the bill was reasonable, service attentive but not overbearing and the tables were filled but not crowded.   Atmosphere was happy but not excited/loud, even though most patrons seemed really invested in the Oregon football game playing out on the TV. We'dug this place as a casual stop after a day of exploring the nearby parks.

    "text": "Grand Opening today for the much-anticipated new restaurant helmed by partners Dave Andrea and Chef Payton Curry in Old Town Scottsdale.    There are two houses with a large patio in the middle of this beautiful property. The deli building which houses fast service and food to go is to the left and the bar where food is ordered and the taps, is located in the building to the right. The seating in both are cozy and comfortable. The bar side displays an extensive array of beer and a chalk board to advertise the live beer alerts.   We sat on the patio at a refectory table, an elongated table used originally for dining in monasteries in Medieval times or the Late Middle Ages. Think casual Harry Potter dining. The water misting system kept us very comfortable. Chill guys and gals come to your table to serve.   The menu is showing gourmet options and exotic meats including duck sausage with dates, Moroccan lamb sausage, and turkey loukaniko, rattlesnake and rabbit. Traditional German food at a Christmas reunion table, with the exception of the snake. I also see local favorite food like grilled artisan sausages, burgers, Belgian fries, hand-twisted pretzels.    Today I ordered up a Chemay Cing Cents. $12. This is a 99 point triple white with an ABV of 8%. Poured into a Chimay Belgium 10 oz., goblet. Shows its typical golden colour, a slightly hazy appearance and its fine head. I love Trappist beer. For my second beer I order a Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Ale. $8. Lightly chilled 11.2 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. This is an 86 point dark reddish brown ale. Drinks like a cider. Crisp and easy, definitely on the sweet side. A good sipper. My GF ordered the Spaten Oktoberfest $6.   We shared a sweet brat with an apricot onion chutney topping. $5.75 and a hard pretzel. The Honey Mustard and the Dijon are Haus made. The sausage was excellent and the in house mustard was superb.   I placed an order to go for the kids. The Pig Mac. $7.50 A 1/4 lb pork sausage & a 1/4 lb ground beef with lettuce, pickle, caramelized onion and hush hush sauce. This sandwich is a monster and will need to be cut into quarters to eat. On looks alone it's a winner.   Also I brought home desert for later. Drunken Date Cake $5 An intoxicating sponge cake made with Oatmeal Stout. I might have this at midnight, will let you know.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brathausaz.com&s=5ac631735031a9388b3ef4f3b93491d79994c1a4d2c5fff55d2044e9358832f4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">brathausaz.com</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBratHausAZ&s=3f6f30b693f16f667a686c63ec3edbebfb0db3f11dee93eb28c8c8bde4d7cfda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/BratHausAZ</a>",

    "text": "I hate to do this but I must. We stopped into Brat Haus yesterday on a gorgeous sunny afternoon. Our party of 12 arrived in two sets of 6 diners. We opted for outdoor seating after being greeted in the most reticent of ways. Before I go further, it was NOT crowded! Our server was the most inattentive, unfriendly, and downright surly waitress I have ever encountered. Her defiant disgust was evident from start to finish. We waited 20 minutes for water, another 15 - 20 for our drink orders to be taken. We did split checks, and I know this is not easy for servers or welcome actually, but the rude dismissal is so unnecessary. I can't imagine we're the first group to ask to split the check here. I also understand that 18% was placed immediately on our tabs for service, and she never would have received that tip from me. However, good service would have earned so much more for the effort. Maybe a smile once?? Waters were never refilled, the food was merely passable today, and not one among us thought our service was anything but bad. Two stars today for the beer selection, and nothing else. I know this review won't detract from your popularity, but hey... In the absence of good service, I won't be back to spend my money here when there are so many other choices around town. Oh, and the single ladies' bathroom out back was dirty too. Sorry.",

The pretzel and beer cheese dipping sauce were a chewy, savory start to my meal. It was so good I almost ordered another for my main. Thankfully, I resisted the urge, which was a good thing because it left room for the brat sliders, the Belgian fries with blue cheese dipping sauce and the drunken date cake! Luckily I had a 16 oz hard cider to wash it all down with...  This was one of the best casual German dining adventures I have ever had. And that means a lot from a girl named Heidi!",

Also there's no parking and rude people block the path out and street by taking pictures, so plan accordingly. ; )",

    "text": "I went here twice in a weekend, after never going before.  Huge caveat: this is not a place to go if you want something upscale and chic. This is not someplace you bring your fussy grandma. This is not someplace you'd enjoy if you don't like meat and beer.  But I do enjoy meat and beer, so I really enjoyed Brat Haus.  What I enjoyed most is their beer selection. It's truly one of the best in the Valley. Their staff is incredibly knowledgeable, which is a must with such an exotic beer list. A problem, sometimes, with these sorts of places is that they're snooty and the staff can be heavy on the beer knowledge, and light on the service quality.  Not here. I went first with just me and my date, and all of our food and drinks arrived promptly. The second night, it was much more crowded and we were a semi-drunk rowdy group of fourteen. Our waiter dutifully catered to our requests for more and more drinks, and strange customizations to their food. He also had suggestions for us no matter how unspecific we were. I listed off five or so craft beers I enjoyed, and he suggested a dark IPA that I'd order again (and again) given the chance. My date told him about tastes and styles she likes, and he also had a suggestion she liked. Which is impressive, given that she doesn't really like beer.  Their food, by the way, is amazing. I haven't had a brat I haven't loved. Their fries, and the amount of delicious sauces you can have with them, are also worth trying. I had a lamb brat with apricot chutney that was divine, but I was also impressed by my date's original brat and sauerkraut. On the second night, I tried their pretzels (nice and fluffy) and their spicy brat. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't spicier, but pairing it with toppings heavy on the spice and vinegar pumped it up enough that I was pleased.  My increasingly drunken friends and I also appreciated the amount of party games they have on their patio. We played some hacky-sack hole game (it's probably actually called something officially) and giant Jenga. The Jenga especially was a big hit with our impaired hand-eye coordination.  I'd be tempted to take a star off for the lack of parking, but I'll keep it there because it's Old Town Scottsdale, and parking is sparse everywhere. You can park in the restaurant next door if they're not super crowded (they're terrible, by the way, so you're not missing anything) or down on second street in the lot next the tattoo shop if you don't mind walking half a block.  Also, I can't take a star off a place that managed to completely avoid playing any songs that I hated. Seriously, people, enough with the classic rock Muzak. Sometimes stuff is so inoffensive its offensive.",

After finding us a table (which the my weren't very pleasant about) it look nearly 20 min to take our order.  Only had the food came out the other 1/2 Was delayed 15 min and then we ere still missing plates.  Food quality was poor and service was horrible.        If I may add a few words. My fiance had checked out several restaurants and shared with me their website and by the pictures we were excited to call and make reservations.  It was my birthday and we just wanted some great German food .  We arrived on a Sunday. The hostess would not work with us on a table for six with two young children.  Then when we finally sat down to order. The waitress seemed to be bothered by us asking questions and looked as though she really did not want to be at work.  Very sloppy plates of food and had lack of care when it took them 30 minutes to burn a \"hot dog\"  and not come to table to let us know right away as to what happen.  There were two starving children who keep asking  us about there food and upset when oily French fries and burnt hot dogs came to the table.   Again the the menu is deceptive as well as the pictures. Never will we recommend this restaurant  to friends or family.   Zero!! Zero!! Goose egg for sure.   Oh and one more thing they would not allow birthday cake to be brought to share on my special day.",

Obviously it was really hot outside, but the restaurant was still pretty busy & with the number of people we had, I'd definitely say that their service here was on point. Everyone ordered drinks at different times but the food order was put in all together, and everything came out accurately & also all together. They were also great in providing separate checks for everyone making cashing out easy for us.  Unfortunately, the reason why I'm rating this place 3 stars is because of the food. I had gotten the Jerk Chicken Brat with onions and a side of fries & the truffle aioli sauce. The fries were done well and sauce was really good, complimenting the fries well, however for this being a brat place, I was very disappointed with the brat. It was pretty dry and the onions on top tasted weird because they were really sweet. I ate about half the brat but did filch some fries from my neighbor tho! And also, it wasn't just me - I don't think anyone else seemed too impressed with their meals.  I will say that we hung out outside after we were done eating and the patio was definitely the best part of this place. It was a fun casual environment for us to hang out & enjoy some drinks and play games. It was just really disappointing that the food was lacking so much.",

Inattentive wait staff was the beginning of the drawn out, sub par experience. We had to ask for water 4 times from 3 different people before it actually came out. Wings - $9, extremely small, and you receive only 6 wings. Look, I understanding being in old town scottsdale and charging a premium for food, but that generally comes with expectations of delivering a quality experience. I Ordered the pepper jack brat (recommended by the server) I asked for it extra crispy specifically stating \"I almost want it black\". 1) no pepper jack 2) stale and dry bun 3) It came out the same as everyone else's, not crispy at all.  When I asked if they could make it crispier the server asked me to remove the brat from the bun, remove all of the toppings and put the naked wiener on an empty tray that was sitting on the table... very sanitary way to handle food.  Once it returned (still not very crispy) I had to place it back in the cold bun, put the toppings back on and try to enjoy the rest of the meal as my friends played Jenga (home made with spare lumber that naturally sits off balance).

It'll require an acquired taste for their options however, the draft and drink menu is extravagant where their food menu is simple yet out of this world.

I tried everything they ordered and thought all the food was great except the fries from the appetizer menu, they seemed overseasoned for our taste. I ordered the pig mac burger that consisted of a hamburger patty, a sausage patty, onion jam, cheddar cheese and an egg sunny side up on top, I'm not a fan of eggs whatsoever but I figured I'd give it a try and was not disappointed. I would have given this place 5 full stars if this review was based off my experience alone however not everyone in my group left satisfied. The prices are a little more expensive than you would think for some bar food, but this place does in fact specialize in their brats so I can't argue. As well as being in a nice area of town, it makes sense as to why the prices are what they are. I do recommend trying this place out before 2pm in order to receive their lunch special which should cut the bill in half, overall I would visit again but definitely before 2pm and enjoy one of their marvelous brats.",

My boys had the kids meal hotdog and it was big enough for them to share one. They also shared a root beer float. The root beer was awesome. It was a little expensive to me, but the atmosphere made up for the cost. We went on a nice day but there were heaters in the outside area that would be great for a chilly evening!",

I highly recommend the brats (of course!), the pretzels and the fries.  The atmosphere is so fun and casual.  I highly recommend you give them a chance if you have not been there!",

So we did near the jenga board about 10 min later a table of three sat and another 10 min after that another table of 2 sat both got service and we were still waiting..... so I went inside to ask for a beer menu bartender looked irritated with something, without saying a word handed me one then left. I waited 5 min didn't then went back to my table and we debated about another 5 or so min to leave or not, not seeing anyone who worked there, we left. Another table left with us said they were there about 10-15 min before us and no service either...... what's going on?! Idk not at all good for business no matter how many times your on tv or how good you \"WERE\" doing. Just a thought from a local chef who frequently comes here.... I should state that this is not the 1st, 2nd or the 4th time this has now happened my last 5 or so visits here which is why I am posting this low score.",

    "text": "I don't even know where to begin.  I had been here once before and it was just ok, so this past Saturday (1/26/19), I was out with a friend at the farmer market in Old Town, we saw the booth for Brat Haus and decided to go there, instead of DaFalcos, boy was a big mistake that was!  So we get there, park in the back on the street and come in from the back into the outdoor dining area, there are NO signs to direct us to the hostess, in fact, we walked RIGHT past the Hostess who was standing at the Hostess stand and said nothing to us as we clearly looked confused as to where to go as we passed her.  We quickly figured out where she was and she sat us.  This experience goes from bad to worse.    So we sit down, order something to drink and place the order, first a pretzel then a few minutes later lunch.  Pretzel comes out and it was delish, the cheese sauce that came with - not so much, but the pretzel was the best part about the place, well, that and the music they were playing.  So....the food took FOREVER to come out, the place was not even busy, there was a guy there with two wiener dogs who would NOT shut up! I have a dog, I love taking him places with me, but he does NOT bark, he is very good and very well behaved, he would never think of barking at EVERY SINGLE PERSON who walked by.  No one, and even dog owners do not want to listen to a barking dog while they are trying to eat.  Ok, back to the main complaint, so the food finally comes out, I ordered a Brat Haus Cheeseburger...for $11 !! It comes out and looks like a McDonalds cheeseburger, it was so damn teeny!  I was in shock to say the least.  I even commented to the waitress \"That's the teeniest burger I have ever seen.\" Her response?  Walked away after putting my friends plate down in front of him, which by the way, was the wrong order.  We ordered a small side of fries for $5 (ridiculous), the fries were not hot and not good, I can't believe they actually get $5 for that!  Anyway, my friend, not wanting to wait another 40 minutes for a freaking sausage, ate what they  brought him, he said it was not good, some sausage with cheese inside it, looked gross to me. Anyway, while we were eating the emotionless waitress came back with a plate of food and fries??? what?? I guess the other server brought us the wrong food ! No shi* ! This really happened.  I only ate 1/2 of my burger, it was burnt to boot!  My friend told the waitress she brought him the wrong food and she did take it off the bill, but still, $25 for a pretzel, Dr. Pepper, hamburger and fries???  This place needs a serious reality check. If they want to see how a REAL burger should be, they should go eat at REHAB Burger, now that's a burger!    So the ONLY good thing I have to say about this place is that the music was awesome and the pretzel was pretty good.  Everything else, food and service .. BAD BAD BAD.    With Spring Training just around the corner, I hope that the manager reads this review and takes it to heart. I am not usually one to complain but .  . . .   this was bad, especially since it was NOT busy.",

I went in alone and didn't have anyone wait on me so i went up to the bar and asked to order. i also asked for a glass of water and had to ask a second time before actually getting it. For some reason the server made my food to go  too. So my polish sausage was cold when i got it and in a box i didn't ask for. Also i had to get up and find napkins on my own. I don't know what his problem was cuz it wasn't even busy in there. And it would be not so bad if he had been more friendly but i even overheard him being kind of rude to other customers. he just was not very warm or welcoming.. And who knows maybe he had a stressful day but jeeeez what terrible service! especially for a part of scottsdale that's supposed to be all hip and fancy.  He was a blonde-ish, long haired guy.   Food was not very good for just a hotdog for $10! sorry but i just haven't been impressed with this place (came once before with some friends and wasn't impressed then either).   Must be their beer keeping them together???",

    "text": "Complete disappointment!  I read about the way they make fries and went to try them.  All I can say is COLD, SMOOSHY, COLD, ICK!  My friend was nervous because we were the only customers at noon, but I wanted to try the fries, so we stayed.  Bad Idea!    The waitress sat us inside, as requested, but then left us. We had to get our own straws; she took a great while to come see about us; she just sort of disappeared.  When she gave us the crinkled, dirty menu, she said \"this is our lunch menu.\"  Turns out, it's the only menu. She told us that \"hush, hush\" sauce was a thousand island style sauce, but it was actually a white sauce.  I didn't dare put it on the fries because I didn't want the fries any colder.    The inside seats were super uncomfortable; they were metal chairs that looked big enough for children's Sunday school classes.  Outside seating  was just picnic tables.  When I spend $12 for a la carte cheeseburger, I want to be able to relax into a nice chair.  We never saw anyone else come in the dining room while we were there, which was lunch rush, and only two outside tables had customers when we left around 12:45. I definitely know why, and, worst of all, my friend was right.  When the place is empty at lunch rush, RUN away!  Did I mention that the fries were cold, smooshy, and ick!",

Many craft beers--no bud, Coors, or Miller, but the waiter suggest a Ballast Point Long fin lager which was wonderful. The Belgian fries were to die for. We had truffle aioli and ranch as sauces. Such a cool place!  Outdoor beer garden, an indoor bar, and a small dining area for eating inside if you don't want to go into the bar.

I ordered the Greek brat and was blown away by how complex and lovely the flavors were. You can add additional toppings, but Im glad I went with the bartenders recommendation of just apricot chutney. I honestly could have just ate the sausage by itself and been just fine. I could have eaten three of them if I didnt have other places to try! The bun it comes on is really big. Like they use a mini hoagie bun instead of a regular hot dog bun. Its a good idea, especially when they load a bunch of stuff on it, but I didnt end up eating all of the bun anyways. The apricot chutney was sweet but not too sweet. Almost like a sweet relish but not at all dilly. They have a great rotating lineup of draft craft beers. There's a good variety of all sorts.   Either way, you wont be disappointed in what this place offers.",

What makes it cool is the toppings you get a choice of 2. And then to top it off they have an assortment of ketchup and mustard at the table. Authentic maybe not but good - most definitely! Oh yea, the fries are delicious and the bier (isn't that the most important part)? Many great ones on draft. Was too hot to sit on the HUGE patio in back but the owner (yea he came out), the owner filled us in on live music starting in September and welcomed us back.

Yes, please order the beer by #s, not the actual name. Food - this was actually the let down. We had the deviled eggs, they were more like mustard eggs. Just way too much mustard. We ordered the knockwurst & boar bbq, both sausages way OVERCOOKED. I couldn't believe it. Both were dry and needed additional sauce, mustard, something. The German potato salad also was a miss, sure maybe their version,  but it was more just cooked potatoes, light on any sauce. Overall, average at best. Wish I had chosen otherwise.",

But Brat Haus turned out to be a pleasant surprise: lots of parking at the back, and the food is excellent and reasonably priced. I also loved the very friendly service and the spacious patio area. The menu lists several tempting items that have pretty much made it certain that I will be returning.  That that patio is also dog friendly means that when my bestie comes over to visit and brings his dog with him - which is always - this is definitely the place for us to go and have a great meal.",

For kids there's corn hole, huge blocks for building & sidewalk chalk. A big ol' sign on the side of the wall says, \"I wish I had the courage\" with several lines below where diners can add their wishes with chalk.  Food was interesting but hit or miss. Fries with beer cheese sauce and bacon were irresistible. My Molotov Cocktail with green chile vodka, raspberry, lime & ginger beer was good...for about 3 sips. The haus brat was super yummy (for America) but the ginger pork and chicken sausage was small, mushy and grainy. The German potato salad was served warm - which must be how they serve it somewhere in Germany but I've been to Germany three times and was always served a more traditional yellow potato salad. This version was just not for me.  We'll be back, though, hopefully for Oktoberfest or some other celebration!",

I'm so glad that Monica suggested Brat Haus for our October 2016 International Supper Club UYE meetup.  I was reminded that I had never returned since I gave them a bratty review.   Well, I enjoyed my meal and the service so much for the October ISCUYE meetup that I went back for lunch yesterday too.  The outside space for this restaurant is simply divine.  Lots of picnic style tables and plenty of shade.  Hands-down, their fried pickles are A-1!  I don't understand how they get the some crispy.  Their Dutch fries are wonderful too.  I'm still figuring out the sausage thing.  While  I love sausage, I was not a fan of the house spicy sausage.  I did enjoy the chorizo sausage.    BTW, they are expanding the business into the building next door (north side) with an extended restaurant called \"Smoke Haus\".  Is that supposed to be German BBQ?  I wonder.  Well, good news is, they have a large parking lot behind that building, so parking should be fairly easy.    I'm going back again, maybe not until the spring, but I'll be back... I still have to have a sausage and beer.  :-)  And I havn't made it to the poutine yet.  But that's on my to-try-list too.  Return Factor 80%",

We came here for my boyfriends birthday with a group of about 9. The waitress was kind enough to put the cakes in the fridge for us but that is where her pleasantries ended. She seemed very annoyed that we were taking so long to decide and was irritated when we asked for a refil, some ranch and actually said? \"you really need more....?\" when my boyfriend asked for more lemons for his schnitzel.  I'm assuming her service was so shitty because she had the automatic gratuity added to the bill due to our large party because there were only two other tables filled in the whole joint.   The food is no where near authentic and I thought the fries were too greasy and all the sauces just tasted weird. The schnitzel was flavorless and the gravy was horrible!! My schnitzel sub was very bland and greasy but the bread was decent.  Someone got a brat that was actually really good and had awesome sauerkraut.    To sum it up, stick to beer or a brat if you come here. Not at all a German resteraunt.",

Anyhow, the food here was really good. All the dips and items with mustard were perfect. The service was fantastic.   Even though it is stupid hot out in the summer, they have lots of fun ways to cool off- misters, fans, and a big bounce house-style water slide for everyone. There are lots of outdoor games (darts, corn hole, etc) and kids and dogs are very welcome. They even have food for the pups!   So, why the 3-star review? The prices were a little steep and they have got to figure out a better parking solution. Otherwise, it really was A-Ok!",

I have tried many veggie burgers in my life, and I think I may have found \"the one.\" It was so tasty and did a great job staying together. The dressed arugula and pickles on top complimented the burger just so. Usually I find myself drowning veggie burgers in condiments and cheese, but this was great as is. Of course, I had to ask for extra pickles because I'm an unrelenting addict. My husband really liked his gigantic haus brat and loooooved the german potato salad. I also got a small order of fries so I could try out all the condiments kept in the 6-pack cartons on the table. The house made curry ketchup is out of this world good. It was hard to stop stuffing my face. Although this place focuses on beer, the cocktail list is great too. The new fashioned and kentucky mule were delicious and very strong. We like a place that doesn't skimp on the booze!  I look forward to coming back so I can try the pretzels and date cake.",

On top of their extensive beer selection, they have a big selection of unique bottles sodas. I tried the butterscotch root beer and it's weirdly delicious!! I was not a huge fan of the bratwurst, HOWEVER I'm not a big bratwurst fan to begin with. So being that I have a bias to begin with, I went for a unique flavor (pepper jack) hoping that it didn't taste like a traditional brat. Still not my favorite, but I think it's my own personal taste. The bun they serve it on is amazing!  The service wasn't stellar, but it wasn't terrible either. I could tell that they were short handed and in need of help, so quite possibly an off day.

I kept on saying to my wife, man I have had this before. chicken reminded me of another time!! Finally hour in a half later, it struck me!!! Chicken tasted just like Swanson frozen tv dinner!!! I grew up on that! So you can take that any way you want! You need to eat the pretzels with no salt. Comes with way to much! The pretzels rolls were probably the best dinner rolls I have ever had. Since I was driving, it was a no beer night! Would like to come back and try some brats and beer. Outdoor patio is the best, on cool nights they have a great fire pit! Plenty of room, Until next time and a second visit!  Later,",

Tall brunette with the personality of a door knob and the customer service skills to match. She really put a damper on our small group's enjoyment of this place. We phoned and spoke to Mike the General Micro-Manager about our experience some days later and he could have cared less. Way to run a restaurant amigo!  Space is very cool with a bar building on one side and the main restaurant on the other side of a driveway... this all topped off by an area courtyard full of wooden picnic tables and an impressive grill. Great set-up.  Food was very good. Too many odd German beers on tap however. Establishment would be wise to concentrate on more American craft brews as they are as fresh as can be... and they'd be supporting these operations. Bring back most of the Belgian styles when it's not 107 F outside.   Would try this joint again but only if the bartender working really cared about the customer. Will not tolerate this type of indifference from an establishment. Plenty of other restaurants all up and down Scottsdale Road happy to take our business.",

    "text": "Welcome to Old Town, Brat Haus. Stay as long as you like!   I am so happy that Payton Curry decided to bring his new concept to Old Town. We need more \"out of the scene\" spots like this! This restaurant/bar is casual, cool and nothing like many of the \"sceney\" spots that surround it in Old Town. Here, it's all about unique craft brews and one-of-a-kind brats.   I like beer, but sadly I don't know my beers like I should. Brat Haus houses a selection of top notch beers from all around and for those who lack beer knowledge like me, they have a menu that describes each of the beers and even describes what the different types of beers mean. Now, if you are a beer snob or wish you could be one, this will be your brewski haven because you'll enjoy some delicious options.   The food here has a simple concept but there's nothing simple about the thought that goes into these culinary delights. The main entree items are brats and you can enjoy classic ones like a beer brat or spicy brat, but they also have creative options like Thai Chicken brats, Spanish Pork Chorizo, Vegan Grain Sausage and even Rattlensake! I also noticed some tasty looking burgers and some yummy salad options like a Spinach salad with bacon croutons and a Chopped Wedge Salad with Bleu Cheese Bacon dressing.   For the meal, we started with the homemade pretzels and sharp cheddar cheese fondue. The pretzel was like nothing I've ever had and I could tell it was definitely not your Costco pretzel. It was soft, salty and perfect when dipped in the fondue or the homemade mustard. Since this was my first time here, I decided to order a classic brat so I went with the beer brat. We got the large order of Belgium fries for the table to go with our brats.   After biting into my brat, I realized that I've never had a brat like this anywhere. They were brats with a foodie-twist and definitely in a good way. I don't know what type of beer they used in the brat but it gave it a unique flavor. I ordered root beer onions and spicy peppers for my toppings. Tasty!! The Belgium fries were salty, crunchy and just what the doctor ordered. I enjoyed the variety of condiments, including curry ketchup! Everything here is a simple concept but with a culinary and unique twist. Even the pickles weren't your average \"from a jar pickle.\" They were round!   This is definitely being added to my list of Old Town favorites and I can't wait to come back and visit, especially when the whether cools down and we can utilize they spacious patio!",

We were able to sit in the shade but it was still very hot. We love their fries, their Hush Hush sauce is really nice, and you have to try their Curry Ketchup, it is personally my favorite.

Holy Shit these are good! Where the hell were these when I was popping those hard nasty ass pretzels in the microwave. Baked to perfection these soft pretzels are soft and chewy yet have a nice baked crust. Salted evenly with the beer cheese for dippin, is a huge hell yeah! I will definitely be coming back to try the brats and beer. Naturlich! (I sure hope that translates to Hell Yeah!)",

My favorites would be any of the brats, the garlic fries (so good), or the tomato and burrata salad. Your dog can eat free on Sunday's too (they make a special sweet potato brat)! Also, Brat Haus has a really fun outdoor vibe; you can play bags, ping pong, etc. You can even get all brats and all the fixing's to-go for you own BBQ. I only will give it 4 stars because service can regularly be sub-par. But the food keeps bringing us back!",

Our server made a couple suggestions on their drink selection, since it was clear we were newbies in German craft biers.   We tried two new craft brews and I really liked mine. However, my friend went with a red ale, and unbeknownst to him, it turned out to be a Sour.   When our server came and asked us how we were doing, he remarked to him that he didn't like how tart his beer was. Our server took the beer away and gave us another selection on the house. What I really appreciated is that he ended up complimenting the more expensive beer and charged us the lower amount. Kudos to him for such a great gesture.   Minus one star because we had to chase down our server to order in the beginning when it really wasn't very busy...but I think they were trying to shut everything down for closing.",

    "text": "First, let me say, I really wish that I could give this place more than 3 stars.  It is such a cool concept, and the atmosphere is great, but those things don't make a restaurant.  First, though, I will elaborate on my previous statement.  Brat Haus has an awesome outdoor area.  They have large tables, games--including tetherball, which I hadn't seen in years--, and I think they even show movies on the wall sometimes when the weather is nice.  But...  The food, for the most part, is nothing to write home about.  The one thing worth mentioning is the pretzel with beer cheese appetizer-- oh my Lord, it is amazing!  It is even better than the pretzel balls with beer cheese down the street at Culinary Dropout, and I thought nothing would beat that.  Oh, and the fries are pretty good.  Unfortunately, though, that's the best that it gets.  The brats are alright.  Actually, I haven't had many of them, but I wasn't thrilled with the one I had, which was just the basic Haus Brat.  I love both duck and veal, but I was very disappointed that those brats both included fennel.  If you're not familiar with fennel, it tastes like licorice.  It can be good in some dishes, but I don't want it in my brats, so I haven't tried those.    I was very excited to try the schnitzel, but it had no taste-- ZERO.  I had it on a sandwich, and it was alright, but then I took the meat off and tasted it, and it tasted like nothing.  So disappointing.  I've also had the Pig Mac, and it's definitely better than the brats or the schnitzel, but still not something that I crave...and it's ridiculously large.   Finally, I can't not write about how horrible the service was the last time I went there.  Now, I will say, I don't remember the service being so awful on my previous visits.  However, last time, my party and I almost walked out.  The place was next to empty, and it took 15 minutes for the server to bring our drinks, which included 2 sodas and a water!!  That is ridiculous!  Once we got our food, he made very little effort to check on us for the remainder of our time there.  If those pretzels hadn't been so freakin' amazing, we probably would have left.  So, if the weather's nice and you're looking for a cool spot to hang out and drink beer and eat pretzels, then the Brat Haus is probably a safe bet.  Otherwise, I'd skip it.",

Which, I should have known, eating at a place named after meats, but alas, I tried to venture forth.  Besides that one unpleasant experience, i have nothing but good things to say about Brat Haus. The staff is so friendly, so much so that we had a \"regular\" waitress for a bit there and she would recognize us (which has been a dream of mine, very Cheers-esque) and even taught us how to say you're welcome in German. I tend to always get a pretzel and the chicken brat. However, I've had a bite of the house brat recently at the Sugar Ray concert at the Downtown Chandler Concert Series and my gosh... I would highly recommend.  The cheese curds too. My gosh, how have written this review so far and not mentioned their golden, crunchy, cheesy goodness. A MUST.  As a tip, they tend to come out to the events in Downtown Chandler, the Oktoberfest, the Concert Series... Fun events and good food",

Nothing like what I have had in the pass, but the guys liked it.   The advice about trying the pretzel and going elsewhere for dinner was probably good, although we didn't try the pretzel.  The service - above average.",

Where can I begin?  Mike and Kevin were great...very attentive and pleasant.  The ambiance is the BOMB, especially since the weather's so nice.  We went to town on brats, belgian fries, and even dessert.  It was all really yummy and definitely an option when going out with friends in the future.  The only thing that would get this place an additional star is putting more fun stuff on the menu!!!",

    "text": "Had a hankering for grilled hot dogs with all the fixins',  when my husband came home and mentioned Brat Haus.  Newly opened in Oregano's old flagship location in Old Town Scottsdale, this place was great!  The servers are all attentive and helpful with suggestions and the beers are plentiful.  We enjoyed a Spaten Oktoberfest and a Krombacher Pils.  With over two dozens brews on draft, it was hard to decide. No domestics here, friends, and that's the way it should be.  We were recommended the fundido, stone hearth-baked pretzels, perfectly salted and served with a creamy cheese sauce and spicy mustard. For dinner, the Spicy Brat with root beer grilled onions and Apricot Onion Chutney.  They use Niman Ranch pork, chicken and beef for all of their sausages which made me instantly add another star to my review.  The  Spicy Brat's casing was perfect...soft yet snappy and not too thick. I was happy with the sausage. Next time, I'll order the Beer Brat. The Apricot Chutney was also delicious! For our side, we chose fries with Truffle Aioli and Bleu Cheese-Bacon Sauce.  Both of their sauces were good as well. For dessert...well, I was way too full to even consider it, but when Dave Andrea himself highly suggest you get the Drunken Date Cake...you DO IT! I will return JUST to get a piece of this cake again.  Dave was right...the cake did not make it to the next day. Made with oatmeal stout and topped with ice cream and caramel sauce...this was phenomenal. My husband and I fought over who got the last bite!   We will definitely return!",
