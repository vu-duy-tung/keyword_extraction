    "text": "A few weeks back a couple of Yelp/Facebook friends made a big deal out of going here for lunch.  Well, not quite here but a location in Tempe.  The reviews looked good but that was too far for me to drive for lunch.  After checking the website it turns out the Mesa franchisee opened this location in February of 2008 right across the street from Glendale Community College.  I got there right at midday and the place was over half full, mostly college kids but a few workers from the area too.  Things look to be in a bit of disarray but I think that is deliberate.  Because all of their sandwiches are toasted be prepared to wait for the bread to toast.  I had an 8\" White Widow (chicken with ranch dressing and a bunch of other stuff) on garlic bread and a bowl of cheddar broccoli soup to which they added shredded cheese and mushrooms on top of.  It was all pretty good, toasting the sub roll first adds a bit of a nice twist to the standard sandwich shop. Total with a soda and tax was $9.86 and I was full.  They could have done with a bit more often cleaning of tables and common areas, but this was lunch time with a younger crowd of customers. Overall I would say about 3.4.  I would definitely go again.",

    "text": "After a hard morning of rock climbing, my buddy and I ventured here to satisfy our sandwich cravings. He was once a student at Glendale Community College which is right across the street from this sandwich shop. As such, I trusted his opinion of the area and had moderate expectations.  I ended up ordering the Jamaican Red sandwich that was recommended by the cashier. The menu describes it as a sandwich construct of grilled chicken breast, green bell peppers, jalapenos, black olives, and cheddar cheese. Top it off with chipotle sauce. Freakin' delicious. A solid sandwich place with some not-so-subtle nods to weed, which is very alright with me!  To conclude, it's a solid sandwich shop. More than that actually. It's a quality sandwich shop with good ingredients, great flavors, and a fun atmosphere! =)  Note: Rumor has it that this place becomes crazy poppin on 4/20 and the lines become super long! But apparently they have a DJ as well for that day...?",

No seriously, I'm not a pothead. Also delicious are the little treats you buy near the front register. Homemade rice crispy squares, things made with peanutbutter. Dude, I love you man!

    "text": "if you have seven dollars to spend on a sandwich, you can get a footlong from Quizno's or Subway, or you can get an 8-incher here, and realize exactly why you hate Quizno's and Subway. The place is marijuana-themed. I thought this was cute the first time I came here, since I'm from California, where it's virtually legal, and this was in Arizona, where Pot hadn't been legalized yet. (Although, the girl who made my food told me that AZ has recently legalized medicinal herbs, but that's a whole different story and review.)  The bread they use is baked fresh every day in a nearby bakery. Their ingredients are better than Subway or Quizno's, and their prices are moderately high, but well under 10 dollars, and completely worth it. Everything on the menu shares a name with a strain of marijuana, or something from pot culture. I liked that they're permanently unable to supply a sandwich known as \"Schwag,\" and their pork sandwich is called a 5-0.  Other points of interest are their photos of Chong eating there, Kool-Aid on tap next to their soda fountains, and a huge mural covering a wall and a half depicting what appears to be Adam and Eve smoking blunts in Eden. Of course, there are stickers everywhere, flyers for raves and parties near the sandwich prep area, and really friendly staff. I honestly can't find anything wrong with this place, other than the fact that they're a lot harder to find outside of Arizona.  These are honestly among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten at a restaurant. And though the place has a very heavy commitment to its theme, it avoids feeling gimmicky, and the food is definitely the star attraction. I make a pilgrimage to this restaurant every time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "Oh god, everything was a nightmare. I came in with my boyfriend and ordered a Pinner Griefo with no pickles and a small soup to go. When we got home I tasted my soup and almost gagged. It was over cooked, burnt, and tasted like metal. I drove all the way back and told the manager how it tasted. He tried it himself and agreed that it was horrible but said that I was \"exaggerating\", which made me feel uncomfortable. I understand people make mistakes, but serving old soup that tastes like burnt plastic is beyond insulting. The girl working the counter said it sometimes tastes like that when its been cooked too long, and sometimes she smells it and can't believe how gross it is and she isn't sure why they still sell it. So they know they are serving people horrible food yet they continue to do so?  The manager really wasn't a bad guy and kept trying to give me things for free but after tasting that I really wasn't hungry. Finally he agreed to refund me the soup but had to call another manager because he didnt know how. He ended up refunding my boyfriends card and having me pay him cash (for smaller size subs). In the end he wasn't 100 percent sure that he refunded it so I should call back if it doesn't show up on my bank statement. What a mess.   Got home and opened my sandwich. Had pickles on it. Wont be back.",

I get the Midwest best with garlic and herb bread which is fantastic. The chips they sell are the best!   The have an awesome selection of drinks as well. Kool aide, cherry coke, flavored teas. Mmmm..  Dont forget to order a goo ball for dessert. Dont plan to share it either. You will cherish that gooey ball of deliciousness.

The last time I ordered the sandwich was subpar and the salad was basic. That was a 45 minute wait. Okay. Not really worth the price. Last, if you're going to offer delivery, you may want dedicated drivers. That probably just deliver. I have a feeling they don't. Mid rant update: called. The guy who answered the phone has terrible customer service skills and doesn't know how to deal appropriately. On top of my 85 minute wait, it will now be 20 more minutes. It shouldn't take 2 hours to deliver a sandwich when your store is a mile away from your customer. I should have just driven somewhere but Friday busted ass at work all week lazy. Ooopsies.  not worth the hype and you should probably never order delivery. That's my advice. New rant...it's been about two hours now. But the guy on the phone offered to comp my next meal. And food showed. Thank you",

Because the lines were crazy long and people were getting upset. There were so many people, the workers seemed a little overwhelmed and had to scream out orders 3 to 4 times.  They had a lot of different sandwiches to pick from and I decided to go with the AK-47 (french dip). I thought the place was cool and the weed references were pretty funny. My sandwich was good, not super special and not worth the 20-30 minute wait, but it satisfied my appetite. Oddly, the best part of Cheba Hut was that I got a free frisbee with my sandwich for 420.

Called at 723 to complain since this messes up my whole meal. We're told as soon as the driver got back they'd bring it out. Called at 803 and was told they'd be right here again at 8:40. They offered to send a whole new order right away and the driver was on the way. 9:17.... Still NOTHING. They don't call or show up, and were advised we should return the uneaten food. Over 3 hours! Worst service I've ever had and not even any sort of remorse. If you order make sure it's hours before you want to eat or just go in.   Update: was contacted by the owner regarding our experience and was told the store would contact us to make this right. However, we never heard anything back, which was the whole issue to begin with. We ordered from Cheba weekly, but I won't spend another penny there with such poor customer service.",

It was an 8 sandwich with all hard thick bread and literally one thin piece of meat. It was supossed to come with onions and portebello mushrooms. I saw only 2-3 small pieces of onion. The girl who made and dropped off the sandwich at my table obviously didnt like het job, and she sucked at it! The only good thing about going to Cheba hut is drinking Pepsi in order to prevent yourself from choking on the abundance of bulky dry bread. This pathetic sandwhich, chips, and small drink cost almost $12 bucks! Stay far away from Chebas unless you like paying a lot for awful food and experience.",

The ingredients were good, but the dirty floors and dingy atmosphere turn me off, and I like some dingy places.    The pot theme runs strong and I wouldn't be surprised if most of the staff is high most of the time.    The grossest thing about this place is the grooming of the staff.  I'm not really a judgmental guy, but is it too much to ask that people at least appear to have showered this week if they are preparing my food?? I don't like my food prepared by a fat greasy lady in a shirt that shows her hairy sweaty belly.  And I'm a guy who never trusts a skinny cook :)   Totally hard to eat after watching someone like that prepare my food.  Not to mention the guys with the filthy dreadlocks and yesterdays food covered beard.    I do have to mention that they rice crispy treat with peanut butter puffs and cinnamon toast crunch was fantastic though.  Stick with the munchies at this post 420 retreat.",

    "text": "Before I ever tried Cheba Hut a few years ago, I thought it was some sketchy, hippie filled sub shop since that is what I had heard from others. When I finally decided to try this place, I realized all those preconceived notions were entirely False. While the area and some customers are not the nicest, the shop is completely different. There is a large range of sandwiches to choose from, ranging from all vegetables to nearly all meat. I have yet to have a bad sandwich to this day. My all time personal favorite is the a mix between the Jamaican Red and White Widow, nicknamed Red Widow, was previously recommended to me from an employee. The sandwich contained grilled, juicy chicken with mushrooms, bacon, and provolone cheese topped with the perfectly spicy Jamaican Red sauce. While I have never had one of their salads, I have only heard praises about them. Additionally, they sell chips, cookies, and rice krispie bars, all of which are plentiful and tasty. The prices are not bad as I can get a drink, cookie, and a footlong sandwich for less than $15 and be stuffed. Additionally, they sell both fountain drinks and have both purple and red Kool Aid on tap.   Everytime I have visited, I have been impressed with the look and feel of this joint. The atmosphere is very unique, and not for all, with its heavy cannabis and marijuana influenced themes. The stoner vibes in this place are no joke. All the sandwiches come in three sizes: nugs (4\"), pinners (8\") and blunts (12\"). The treats at the register are called \"munchies\" and the drinks are correctly dubbed \"cotton mouth cures\". Furthermore, many of the sandwiches have names derived in some way from the marijuana theme. Often times, the employees play rock and roll or metal music over the speakers and have a movie playing on the tv there, which for my experience helps this place feel exclusive. Moreover, they often have chalk drawings on the bathroom door that are done well and have skater and marijuana stickers placed all over the store. One wall is an art piece of nature with animals toking the ganja. It is a fun place to go with friends and enjoy lunch or dinner, but I would not want to take my religious, conservative mother here. The neighborhood surrounding the store is not the nicest and some of the people outside are homeless and tweakers. However, when you walk in, it feels like a different place with friendly workers and stoners enjoying their food.   The service here has always been on point. The cashiers are friendly while taking orders and the cooks are vibrant and enthusiastic when giving customers their orders. Unfortunately, this store gets busy with the community college campus being across the street, especially at lunch. Every time it is busy, the cashier apologizes for the wait, even though it is not their fault. Most of the time, there is almost no wait or other customers will let me order first. Every worker I have had knows the menu well and is great at giving descriptions of the sandwiches and can easily identify one if you forget the name. Additionally, the employees are still super kind when they are not working. Sometimes I will see an employee leaving to go home or on break and they are still cheerful and attentive. This place cannot be beat and the employees here help bring that special stoner feel to the store.",

    "text": "I love Cheba Hut (Tempe), but I don't find myself out there too often. Now that I am in Phoenix, and was over on this side for lunch, I was pretty excited to see there was a Cheba Hut nearby. I had a serious craving.  It was noon on a weekday and it was dead. Apparently this location gets super busy when school is in session, so being able to get right in and order was pure luck. My old stand-by is no longer on the menu (AZ Homegrown) so I went with my second favorite, Jamaican Red (add cream cheese). The guy who took my order was friendly and let me know there would be an additional charge for the cream cheese, which I was aware of but appreciate when you are given a heads up.  I got my drink (kool-aid....OH YEAH!), and waited for my sandwich....and waited...and waited....and waited...and waited some more....and, oh yay! Here is is! Finally!!!  First glance, pure disappointment. It was so bready. Toppings were scarce, even though I got everything on it. The chicken wasn't saucy like I'm accustomed to. In fact, it just seemed like plain chicken with some thin buffalo sauce squirted over the top. It wasn't very spicy but I was starving so I powered my way through it, even though the toasty bread tore up the roof of my mouth.  It sucks when you are looking forward to something that you know is so good but ends up being so bad. I'll give this location the benefit of the doubt and just hope I wandered in on an off day. Next time I'll just order something else.",

I like him :))  and very helpful since I was so indecisive on my vegetarian subs. I end up getting the griefo, that's what Ryan suggested.  It was good. He put too much mayonnaise in it. But other than that, it was good.  Geez. The gooo balls, the chocolate chip cookies and the rice Krispy treat..... sooo good. Yet so freakin bad for you.  Haha.  so... people watching was interesting.  Haha I felt like I was in high school all over again. Every single person who walked in was literally stoned!! Haha. Smh. Funnnyyyy.

It was amazing, I forgot what my friend got, but he enjoyed his sandwich to. The employees were very friendly, I had a smile on my face the whole time there. I highly recommend this place.

They said they could run it out again but I was due at work at 5. So I had to pick it up. It was ready when I got there. Yet I still tipped the driver because of pre posted tip. And also a delivery fee. I just feel like they made me feel like the bad guy when they screwed up. Accidents happen but don't blame the customer.",

The goo ball... let's just say I ate it very quietly and didn't give my 6 year old a bite until she noticed I had dessert. It was so good!! I can envision future trips if nothing else to fill a goo ball craving. Can't day anything about the restaurant itself as I haven't been but the food was delish and had I not ordered right in the middle of lunch hour I'm sure my food would have been delivered faster.

I ordered the Humboldt with extra pickles (which the cashier repeated back to me) and was disheartened to get my sandwich with one pickle and no cheese at all (important on a vegetarian sandwich).

Not to mention that they were breaking SEVERAL health code violations, which included no gloves, the cook eating food off the veggie counter and drinking while making sandwiches, spilling his drink on the counter, touching his face and clothing then touching people's sandwiches, it was disgusting! When 45 minutes had gone by we finally said something to one employee, but never got a valid reason as to why everyone else was getting served and not us. Completely unprofessional bunch of employees. The health department should absolutely be checking into this place!!!",

The staff is friendly and they don't speed through the orders even when there is a line and I mean that as a compliment. There's nothing worse than getting food home to find that it was thrown together in a hurry. I want to taste that love! Cheba Hut puts it in there.

Garlic is the best bun to get (again, in my opinion). I can't explain it, but everything seems even across the bread and toasted just right. This is one of the more unique dining options on the West side, and the fact that's it's great food is an added benefit.  It's typically faster to call in an order because the wait can be ridiculous at times. They also offer delivery which I have not tried yet.  I hope they open some more locations along the I-17 or even downtown and uptown. I really can't fathom going back to Subway with Cheba and Silvermine around.",

When we recently found out that someone had beaten him to it, he was a bit sad but also excited for the now close proximity of his favorite herbal-themed eatery.  This location is located in a strip mall along with a Circle K, tattoo parlor and Trails.  (If you're familiar with the area, Trails took over the large space once occupied by the nudie bar and Cheba Hut took over the old Trails space.)  Whether you're a big ol' stoner or a sober square like myself you'll enjoy the tasty sandwiches with funny names.  We even took The Rob's parents for a visit so that his conservative, vegetarian mom and his formerly-tie-die-wearing dad could enjoy the goodness, which they most certainly did.  Only complaints:  1) Pepsi products instead of Coke 2) As stated before, the toasting does take a little while, so you have to wait a little bit for them to bring your sandwich to the topping bar. 3) Lacking in chip selection.  I mean, c'mon, you run an establishment themed around the chronic and you don't offer BAKED chips?",

Again, does not bother me, but could be offensive to some. The reason why I'm not giving a 5 star is because our order was wrong, which we realized when we got home. My husband said no sauce, pickles, tomato, mayo, or onion (basically he just wanted the cheese, meat, and avocado). His order had everything on it and since he can't tolerate spicy food at all, he didn't finish his sub. They weren't busy at all so I'm not sure why his order was wrong?..? We were coincidentally the only people there. I'd still return, but we'll just check out order before we leave next time.",

They are normally good outside of those hours but I wanted to try them before work which I got there at around 1:45pm it was super busy, I had time but I've notice others were upset, especially a family that had like 4 teenagers and 2 parents. When I got in they were having so much issues at the register ordering, and this guy with glasses was laughing and joking around making mistakes which I guess he thought was cool to do. But they made soooooo many mistakes that it seemed everyone's sandwiches kept sending back, which delays the ones coming out. It was a mess I never seen it this bad, till I went during lunch. Just avoid during lunch hours, this place is still pretty good and all.",

    "text": "This was by far one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I have had.  After my family and I worked all day we were finally able to get together for what we thought would have been an enjoyable dinner.  We ordered our food ( this was a hard task as we had to repeat it several times due to the cashier having a hard time hearing us.  This was due to the incredibly loud death metal music playing ).  In addition,  while we were ordering, several cooks were cussing at each other back and forth.  Because of this we decided to take it to go.   Once we received our 4 subs we headed home.   When we opened the foil,  Three of the Four subs were wrong.  My son wanted a sub on white bread with ham and cheese only ( 3 items, how hard can it be ).  This was expressed several times. His sub was oily and drenched with honey mustard and mayo.   I ordered a 5-0 with no peppers, extra bacon/ Cheese and pickle.    It came with one slice of cheese, no bacon, no pickle and it was on white bread instead of garlic.   My wife ordered a white widow no bacon, no onion.  It came with bacon and onion.    Our fourth sub was fine, however my nephew was so hungry, he devoured his.   Once we discovered the mistakes I called at 945.   I explained what happened to an associate, he let me explain everything and then said he could not help me and said he would get a manager.   After what was probably about 5 minutes ( once again, death metal blaring in my ear ) the manager came on the phone.  After explaining the whole thing again he offered me a 25% discount on my next visit.   I asked him if they would remake the order and have it delivered ( we are in the delivery area ).  He explained that they were closed and it was against their policy to deliver after 10   I reminded him that I had called before 10.   I then offered to come pick up the new order and return the wrongly made order.  Nick Hadley ( the manager) said that he could not do that since their registers were closed.  I asked him, \"why do you need a register, if you are just remaking food.  Nick then told me he could only offer a discount on my next order, at a future date.   I asked him how he would feel if he was expecting to have an enjoyable dinner with his family and the whole order was wrong.  With how busy everyone is these days, quality time with family is at a premium.  Nick accused me of harassing him because I asked him how he would feel.   Quite honestly I don't fault him for his lack of managerial and people skills.  It is most likely the fault of Cheba Hut and his direct managers  All I truly wanted was an enjoyable dinner with my family.  I expected that upon finding out their mistakes, the management of Cheba Hut would correct them, not compound them  I expect a phone call from the General or Regional manager ( I left my number with Nick H ).",

I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Sorry no pictures because I devoured my sandwich and some of my husbands.

I really like the variety of flavor they offer. One of my favs is the Appollo 13. It's like a Greek chicken salad on a sub type of bread. You can choose 3 different sizes depending on your hunger. I don't know Where they get their bread or if they make it... but it's really good. Cheba hut also sells salads and other sides and appetizers. I will also add that the serve cookies and brownies but their goo balls are the bomb.  If you never been here. I recommend giving it a try. Oh they have kool aid.",

The price is reasonable with and hot sub restaurant . I also got the goo balls which are amazing if you're a fan of peanut butter. It was a good experience overall. Even though that sort of lifestyle is not my scene, I definitely recommend and will come back!!!",

    "text": "Amazing toasted subs and outstanding service.  I'd heard about Cheba Hut from some friends but I've never been a fan of toasted subs.  Well I had not had Cheba Hut's toasted subs!  The shop is tucked away in a strip of shops next to a 7-11.  We walked in the middle of lunch time on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy.  We ordered a La Canna (Italian) and a Kush (BLT), grabbed a couple of bags of chips, fountain soda.  We couldn't pass up the huge cereal treat bars either.  Snagged a rice krispie treat with reeses puffs mixed as well as a fruity pebbles one.  The treat bars are nice and soft too so you know they are fresh.  We sat down to wait for our subs but they were out before we had our drink cups filled.  They are freshly made. The bread is lightly toasted so it's not hard and chewy.  Both subs had a good amount of meats on them and the seasoning is fantastic.   They come in 3 sizes: nug 4\", pinner 8\", and blunt 12\".  We both ordered the pinner and couldn't finish.  I noticed a lot of to go orders heading out the door.  Cheba Hut offers online and call ahead ordering.    And if you haven't already noticed the shop and menu has a cannabis theme to it.   My only complaint....  that the closest one is 15 miles from my house!",

When I got in I saw something that said they were out of pickles so I asked the cashier if they had enough to put on my sandwich and he said no. So I asked for a discount and he looked at me like I was stupid. You provide your phone number during checkout for a reason right? If you're out of something give the customer a call and let them know. When I got home the Jamaican red that I ordered had no chipotle mayo or red sauce which makes the Jamaican red what it is. To say the least I don't feel like these sandwiches were worth 20 dollars. I'll probably end up calling in tomorrow to let them know that my order wasn't right and let them know their closing shift isn't doing what they need to do.  Update: The manager Zack gave me a call next day and was very kind. He didn't need to offer me a discount for my next visit but he did which was appreciated. I understand that people may be new and it was end of shift on a Sunday but I am glad that they took the time to call and take my feedback about how they handle online orders. Thank you Zack for being so professional even in the world of blunts and pinners!",

But band & military discount paired with their awesome sandwich, as soon as the light turned green I was in. Found out the band was employees & they practice Thursday's & Saturday's there. Dropped the bed of my truck & watched the spontaneous entertainment. I enjoyed the experience throughly & I think it's was a smart move for the owner. The attention and fun will only bring in money! They got my money, Cheba Hut hadn't even crossed my mind until I heard some creativity vibin' from their store front. Awesome time, awesome food, I'm no good for anything in sandwich quality menu-wide, I've only ever had their White Widow but if I get hooked on the first sandwich I try & have been going for years, I think that attests to their food quality! I will definitely be Coming back for some more, Yaaaaassssss! Enjoy my fellow Yelpers",

The name might attract some and put others off, but there's a couple things to know; Yes, this is a marijuana-themed restaurant, and no, they do not sell or allow you to smoke marijuana in the restaurant. The atmosphere at Chibahut is very casual and the seating is varied- tables, booths, and high top tables with stools.  ChibHut serves subs and salads on fresh baked bread that is made daily at the restaurant. Chibahut  boast about their bread and they really should because it is absolutely delicious. I enjoyed the  \"Midwest Best\", loaded with Turkey breast, smoked ham, bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, dressing, on a toasted Garlic Herb Bread. In addition, to salads and subs Chibahut also offers unique sweet treats, like fruit loops rice krispy treat, cookies, and brownies. I'm going to definitely try a fruit loops rice crispy treat on my next visit  The staff at Chibahut are friendly and accomdating, and were helpful when explaining the menu. Although Cheba Hut is a growing chain, it was still a refreshing break from the everyday monotony of other chain sandwich shops in the area.",

The subs are still great much better than your typical subway and their sweet treats are fantastic too, but last time we went they never even attempted to clean the extremely dirty tables after customers left which made everyone have to sit in spots they most likely did not want to sit at. To make matters worse a incompetent employee walked passed the tables multiple times without any resolve to do his job and simply wipe them down. The gentlemen taking orders was no better and kept messing up what we wanted and even charged us for a salad we never ordered. It was not even a complex order. Not saying it will prevent us from going back I just hope next time they will have it together.",

Being a vegetarian, I'm used to some super boring sandwich options, but Cheba Hut has some awesome vegetarian/vegan options that you can customize to your tastes. I grabbed the Humboldt and added some banana peppers and mustard for a little kick and I ate every bit of the sandwich in about 15 minutes. I got medium sized 8 inch on the garlic bread and it's a fairly good portion if you're hungry. You can also break it into two meals if you're not starving which is good too~ Only downside was that my friend, who ordered a sandwich with me, asked for his sandwich with no giardiniera peppers and ended up with them in there. He liked his sandwich as well but stated that the peppers definitely made it less appetizing for him.   Solid place for a great sandwich, esp if you're looking to order online and grab it/munch on it at home! I'm excited to try some of the other sandwiches and sides in the future~",

Had to step aside and read the big board to make the most informed decision. Still ended up going with Chuckie's originally recommendation. Had the Moab. Meatballs with jalapeno cream cheese bacon no veggies. On the garlic bread. It was so F-ing good. It was perfectly toasted the bread has an amazing crunch. The flavors complimented it perfectly. The spice isn't to much it's mellowed by the cream cheese. My bro had the T-Rex basically a club on steroids and add pepperoni. It's legit AF. Other bro had the Jamaican Red. It's spicy chicken green peppers, jalapenos, black olives and cheddar. We added the veggies to both subs. The chicken is tender and is super flavorful just the right amount of spice with the other flavors. Will be back to get toasted again!",

It's tough to get in there if you're coming from the 101 towards 59th Ave. there is a lot of traffic and moves extremely slowly. So that was quite to pain to get around and in there. The area was quite creepy too.  Otherwise the place was kinda cool to check out.   I ordered a pinner KGB minus the green pepper, on white bread. It wasn't busy when I arrived, so I was surprised it took 20 minutes for them to make a small toasted sandwich. It also came out on wheat bread instead. The toast was too toasted for my liking, I left with my mouth tore up from the bread.   So again, it was alright. If you want a great sub, I would highly recommend firehouse subs. They are by far my fave and taste amazing!   I really really wanted to love this place. I wish it were better.",

Which sucks, because the food was pretty good and the atmoshpere 'like way phun, dude'.   It was neat to see Tommy Chong and his wife in photo on the wall, sitting at a crappy table, enjoying the grub. I also got to reminisce about all the clandestine times I had in this very building when it was a crappy, hole in the wall head shop instead of a crappy hole in the wall sandwich shop, and I was the longhaired leaping gnome tie dyed store manager with my '59 VW panel van parked out front.  But all my daydreaming came to an end when I saw Dopey and Grumpy, the two painted and peirced up grrrls they had running the show, put the big Bogart on customer service skills.  (There was no GIVE in their puffpuffgive equation.)  The lady that had the misfortune to arrive at the ordering counter a few minutes after I received my Aculpolco Gold BBQ chicken sandwhich was there a full 4 1/2 minutes before placing her order.  The whole time, Dopey was in the back area, doing dishes by the sound of it, while Grumpy stood out behind the counter near the grilling area on a personal cell phone call.  She was yelling, crying, dropping F-bombs, and just bleeding drama, while speaking, come to find out, to her mother.  Never a word or even glance at poor, mousey customer, who also said nothing.  Eventually Dopey came back up front and the order ensued, but while it was being made, everyone in the building got the irie joy of hearing Grumpy repeat back to Dopey everything we'd just heard from the phone call.  The owners should put as much effort into having just the right Customer Service as they do into having just the right Look for their staff.   Instead of a Suicide Grrl with crusty hair serving it with bad attitude or indifference, I'd rather have a nerdy, ponytailed, hornrimmed glasses and cardigan wearing book-worm serve me my silly drug-named sandwich with a subtle smile and wink.  As a matter of fact, that sounds kind of sexy...",

I work for a Dispencary and we love their food and sacrifice one of our workers to take an extra long lunch and for us to be short handed for extra time just to get some Cheba. These past two visits have been so terribly messed up. This second time being the worst. 4 out of 6 sandwiches actually made it to us and they weren't even made like we asked. I though at this point that since they do deliver the very least they could do is drive the sandwiches to us but the \"manager\" which seemed completely unbothered by the whole ordeal kept telling me we were out of their range (by like 2.5 miles btw). I kept telling him I was quite aware of the distance because well WE JUST DROVE THERE AND DIDN'T GET WHAT WE ASKED AND PAID FOR. He swore he could give me store credit for next time but that's no good when you have an 8 hour shift with no food after you paid for it... We'll be visiting tempe location until the new one by us opens up because these guys just can't do their job right anymore beside our two incidents, our friends down at another Dispencary by us had two different incidents similar to this and the Cheba worker gave them an exta cookie to make up for their mess ups...",

I pretty much just show up and pick a random new sandwich off the menu.  Not a single one has disappointed yet.  They also have salads as well.  Tonight was the first night that i tried one.  My wife had the antipasto salad and I had the southwest chicken salad.  They  were both pretty tasty.  They are large enough that they can easily be a meal on their own.  While the sandwiches here are amazing the little snacks and deserts they have our amazing.  They are some crazy sounding snacks but if you've ever had the munchies all the snacks on here will sounds AMAZING.  They have peanut butter brownies, fruity pebble bars, cinnamon crunch bars, and all kinds of other yummy stuff.  Trust me they are all super tasty.  Another great thing about this place is the fact that they have cool aid.  I don't know about you but I was definitely excited when I saw that.  They  have also started delivering recently and this is great.  To recap, stop reading and looking on here and just head out and get a tasty sandwich.  Hurry, go get it!",

They offer 3 sizes of subs (nug 4\", pinned 8\" and  blunt 12\") on white, wheat or garlic \"herb\" bread. All subs are served with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles and their special sauce. They also serve salads and have a variety of desserts.  They offer several vegetarian options, my personal fave is the majic mushroom with teriyaki marinated portabella mushrooms with green bell peppers, pineapple and pepperjack cheese. I always add honeymustard which was recommended by the cashier on our first visit. In the mood for some meat?  The Dank (a pizza sub) or The Kind (Turkey, swiss, bacon and mushriom) are great too!  And guess what!? They serve Kool-Aid. Ohhhhh Yeeaaahhh!",

My point is that they deliver, and within a wide radius at that. Hopefully, it's in that groovy microbus.   They also cater, which is nice because let's face it--guys like me can probably eat a whole tray. I'll have them bring a platter or five to my workplace, and hopefully they can throw in some Bob Marley posters and glow in the dark stickers. Okay, I'll settle for another 4/20 frisbee.  In any case, any minor complaint I had about this place is either improved or easily forgotten. I could be vegetarian and just sustain myself with your magic mushroom subs every day. Oh, the alfalfa sprouts...someone just got the munchies.",

I see the girl whose supposed to be making my food  \"Kara\" glaring at my friend and I and NOT making my food.  Then I See three different people come after me and get their sandwiches and leave.  Still no food for me.   So I go up and ask her about it nicely, asking if she forgot.  She rolls her eyes at me,  looks right where she left it before and goes yeah uhhh I'll get on that. Then some other girl \"sarah\"  comes up and decided to SPIT IN MY SANDWICH. I was watching her the entire time.  I have to go and demand the remake the sandwich.  They play dumb and lie to my face.  It gets better.  They say \"I didn't spit on your food I was just talking about how you talked shit about the service\"   1. Getting Served AFTER other people who came over 10 mins after I placed my order then asking about it is hardly talking shit about the service.  Even if I did.  I had the right to complain about the fact that my food was never made.  Food I fucking paid for.   2. IT DOESNT TAKE 2 PEOPLE TO MAKE A DAMN SANDWICH.  3. Talking doesn't involve leaning over and producing a white thing from your mouth.  Or anything tangible from your mouth.    The manager did a great job at taking care of me,  he refunded my money and made my sandwich himself with me standing there(at his suggestion)  although I didn't see her getting in trouble on the spot.    I would have liked to SEE her getting written up or fired so I know it happens because no one who spits in food and argues and lies deserves to work in food service or customer service.    Place was cute overall but unless you like being treated with blatant disrespect for no reason  go elsewhere.",

As a former local I know that shopping center is super sketchy.  You see the police in the parking lot frequently and drug deals occur frequently while I am enjoying my Kool-Aid. Buy...I have yet to be robbed and I have also yet to have a great tasting lunch from there (I would not go there at night). I am a fan of cannabis culture and love the giant blunt advertising \"order here\". I also keep trying to convince my friends that anyplace that targets stoners has great food. I love their white widow, pretzel nuggets with homemade honey mustard and the Jamaican pinner. I also always stock up on their munchies, ie. I buy everyone they have out when I am there. I have tried making the same munchies at home but I can not replicate. This visit I had golden grahams rice crispy treats. Who knew they even made golden grahams anymore but yumm yumm. Their staff is super cool and make minimum wage so tip well since they meticulously make your food. Ask them to put in Half Baked while you enjoy your White Widow.  I wish they would open a franchise in Portland but PDX is really one big Cheba Hut so alas they will be my go to sandwich place on my visits home.",

It's in an uninviting strip mall that had a series of questionable people floating about. Meh, that's not really anybody's fault but if I go there again I definitely won't make it a night trip.   My sandwich wasn't bad, but it was a little dry compared to the ones I'd ordered at the other location. I also thought the decor was lacking in comparison and the employees didn't seem quite as welcoming. Maybe I just went on an off night. I'll still give it another shot, this time while the sun is out.",

The food and some of the staff is awesome, don't get me wrong... But what I've experienced is completely unaccepted for even the crappiest plaza food joint. I live nearby. When I'd come by for lunch 6 months ago, several male employees there have sexually harassed me. Asked for the owner's number, and after a good 10 minutes of them trying to \"apologize\" to me they gave me a number... that was either fake or disconnected. One of the girls there kept apologizing to me and kept saying \"This is a problem here, nobody's doing anything about it, I'm so sorry... They treat us like that too.\" I've also witnessed some of the scummy dudes literally shove themselves into a booth with a female customer they didn't know and try to get their number. Not cool, that's literally scary behavior. People don't come there to get creeped on, they come there to eat. The few times I've come for a really late dinner, I've seen 1 specific staff SEVERAL TIMES!!! (NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING!!) go into the bathroom for a long time and come out with a blown out nose... This place is run by cokeheads. Really sad. I'd rather go to the Tempe location tbh, where the vibes are still good, but I'm so disappointed that I'm kind of over Cheba Hut in general.",

My favorite is the White Widow on white bread.  It's a chicken bacon ranch sub with mushrooms.  I pass on the mushrooms but add their chipotle ranch. They have multiple dressings that are made fresh everyday that I'm sure will enjoy.  If you are currently a student at GCC I recommend Cheba Hut over any place you might think about going on campus.",
