Trust me, this place has taken a turn for the worse. My girlfriends and I were there last Sunday and (1) Service was a complete joke (2) Food came out cold (duck fries) and was definitely overpriced (3) Good luck trying to hear anything over their godawful \"house\" music. Seriously no idea when this started, but now they legit blast dance(?) music that can be heard up to a 10-mile radius, which then attracts all the Entertainment District trash. Real winners at Boondock's these days! This bar used to have so much potential, it USED to be unique! Now it's just the same as the others. Such a letdown - will not be coming back.",

They had a huge patio which was nice to enjoy it before it gets over 100.  We enjoyed playing corn hole and ping pong. We would have liked to play jenga but there was only one set.  The service was eh, ok. It could have been better.  Our server went at her own pace. Took 35 minutes to get a sprite.  She brought everyone else's drink but mine. I asked (reminded) her for my sprite 2x and eventually got it.  We waited about 10 minutes for our check after asking for it.  They do have a food menu that I will try out next time.  Looking forward to coming back.",

We seated ourselves, and waited 10 minutes before a waitress bothered to come by. The table top was filthy, and we asked if she could wipe it down and the waitress (Pink hair and lots of Tats) got a huge attitude. 10 minutes later she came back to take our dinner order, (we weren't drinking) and after taking our order demanded a credit card to open a tab. I reminded her we weren't drinking, and she said \"I know, but a lot of people dine and dash, and then I m responsible!\"  We eat out in Scottsdale several times a week for the past 25 years. I have never had anyone ask for a card to open a tab for dinner, again, we Were Not drinking. I was insulted by her attitude and demeanor. I walked up to her at the register, told her I was leaving, and wanted my card back. She then tried to give me someone else's credit card. What a joke. Keep on driving!!!",

    "text": "So we had a group of 8 meet here for MNF/welcome back to AZ HH for a friend. I got there 10mins early & sat at the bar. Not once did I get greeted or asked if I wanted a beverage. Then my friends show up & we seat our selves in the couch section w/ a tv. We wait 20mins for a waitress (KeriAnn) to greet us & take only our drink orders. Then another 30mins goes by still with NO DRINKS yet. Finally a partial drink order makes it to our table and then the other half of our drink order makes it 15mins later. We watch the game & order food. The waitress messed up my order of shrimp & grits with shrimp ceviche, REALLY?? I also ordered the CAB sandwich (that was good) My shrimp and grits came out way after the fact that everyone was finished.  Ok-skip to the pay our tabs part....she then proceeded to charge me for the shrimp ceviche (that was more expensive then what I ordered) When I asked her about it she said \"My managers busy so I couldn't cancel it out, but it's actually cheaper for you\" WRONG. She finally did get the items fixed but also totally messed up on 2 other friends tabs (added drinks) and GET THIS..... Totally forgot an ENTIRE food order for someone & when asked about it she FORGOT AGAIN!!! He was served NO FOOD  the entire time we were there (3hrs)  They have a nice \"game bar\" concept with bags and all (that we wanted to play & drink more) but decided to relocate to The Lodge (just down the street) due to the HORRENDOUS service. I'm SAD The Lodge will be closing soon. I wish it was this place! Never will I be back here, there are way to many other great bars in the Old Town area with way better food & great service (Kelly's, LoCo Patron, RnR, Bungalow, Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers, The Lodge, Bottle Blonde) Visit them 1st so you won't be disappointed!!",

We ordered our drinks and food and everything came out as ordered and was delicious. We each got something different and were all very happy.

The atmosphere and decor is nice, fun and inviting.  The staff was polite, a manager that night was helpful with a silly price issue: the bathroom had signs of advertizing $5 shots of honey whiskey on thursdays; it was thursday and the company party didn't cover shots so we had to pay outta pocket. Ok.  I ask for one and the bartender somewhat rudely tells me \"no, that price is good only until 10pm\".  This is at 9:45pm!  So I told him the time & he replied \"well, you are part of the party so you can not get the promotion\"!!!!!!!! Wtf?  I asked for the manager, because it was silly, if I have to PAY FOR IT, who cares who I am with? Who makes this decisions? The manager wasn't all that happy to see me, looked at me and helped the situation as if I was drunk and crazy... Anyways, end of story, manager TIM gave me the shots for the $5 advertized price after mumbling some bs excuse.    Hence losing a star here.  They could've handled something so simple in a polite manner and acknowledged their mistake.  I think he said the sign was old.  Well, the shots should've been free!  But overall, the place was nice.  They have games and comfortable sofa lounging areas....  Music was decent, drinks were ok, food was not great.  Hence the second negative star!  The staff wasn't frequent with replacement of the small buffet (mac & cheese, burger which was a sad thin patty, french fries, salad, pulled beef or something, couldnt tell cause it was never there, always empty).    Two simple things, easy fixes I supposed; but the grill lost cool points with me..... Let's see what happens next time; if any. :)",

Just because you have a hat that says security on it does not give you the right to berate paying customers. This place should take a good hard look at how their employees represent their business.

    "text": "(Read in a shatter voice) Star date 12162016: a cool cloudy night with a windy breeze created the perfect atmospheric conditions for a great night. There was live music by a band from a foreign town and beers from mystic town. They had an excellent experience created for the patrons to enjoy. I find, what they call \"cornhole,\" to be one of the lost amusing games. They throw corn-filled bags onto a board and someone declares victory... astonishing.   We have travelled many galaxies, but have never encountered such a place. If these fellow compatriots get  my message then you should make a stop to refuel on some liquid gold at boon.   Update star date 957041.24 (Dec 19th)  Captains log, star date 2116.358 (xmas eve): after a long journey searching the last frontier, my crew was in much need of some relaxation. We found ourselves among Boondocks station located in the Milky Way Galaxy. This time we have found that it was a tranquil night; it must be due to the time of the year. We found ourselves playing some rousing games of pool while kicking back that Irish goodness they call Guinness. As we were about to embark on our journey, we were halted by an icy atmosphere that halted our ships from travel. Nevertheless, Boondocks indeed took care of us. This has become a great space station or, new home, for our rests.",

    "text": "I'm going to preface this by saying that I hardly ever leave reviews.  Tonight, I walked over to Boondocks with my buddy to catch the late NFL game.  As soon as I walked in the door, the \"manager\" immediately says \"you're not getting in here.\"  I did a double-take and said huh, why?  He proceeds to state that I look drunk, that my eyes looked red.  (I'm a type 1 diabetic that hasn't had a drink in 4.5 years)   I tell him that I'm not and that I had just finished a cigar with my friend.  He says \"your not getting in here.\"  Again, I tell him that I'm a type 1 diabetic and I show him my Continuous Glucose monitor attached to my stomach and my Insulin.  Around this time, my buddy says hey this is discrimination.    The \"manager\" says to my buddy \"wait, before you get all huffy and puffy and ask for the manager....I am the manager!\"  This goes back and forth for a minute until he says he'll let me in.  But then he says \"if I see a beer in your hand, your gone.\"   I didn't get his name, but he worked tonight, Sunday night 11/6/2017.  Once we got in the rest of the staff were awesome...just this guy who was apparently on a power-trip.",

I would have kindly walked back inside and drunk the water, but no. It was a total f-u.

    "text": "This is usually my go to spot as it is a place to get away from the typical club scene in Old Town. With that being said, I was very disappointed in the attitude of the staff this past Saturday night. Having worked within the service industry myself, some days are just busier than others, but at the end of the day if you're not the type of person to keep your cool, maybe it's not the place for you.... one bartender in particular stood out, Sharri (at least that's what it said on our receipt). My friend had asked her if it was cheaper to get a beer or a well vodka drink and she rudely replied that there was a ten dollar minimum anyways. It was a simple question that did not warrant that type of response. There was also a very rude security guard rudely yelling for people to get out of the walk way. Again, I get that fire safety rules must be adhered to, but there's no need to act like it is your job to enact martial law and flash your flash light in people's eyes. Overall, not exactly sure what type of changes the staff have most recently gone through, but I hope they realize that treating customers properly and courteously should be at their upmost top priority. If this does not change, I do not foresee spending any of my money here.",

I called 3 weeks prior to my visit, spoke to a guy on the phone who was very friendly and assured my friends Bachelorette party of 16 girls would have to pay no cover, no wait in line and have my name on the list. I reserved this for St Patty's Day because i knew it would be crazy everywhere.  When we got to the door these two door guys who had what we call \"chihuahua syndrome\" immediately spoke disrespectful and down to me. I told them my name was on the list for 16 girls, they're response without even making eye contact \"there's no list\" I told them about my phone call and one of the guys told me to meet him around back with $100 cash. \"I don't have any cash\" then he told me \"ATM's Work 24/7\" seriously dude? As I'm having this conversation a guy on his own walks out of the bar and this door guy takes the patron by the back of his shoulders and shoves him into the sidewalk screaming \"i hope you get hit by a bus\" honestly, had it not been a holiday and crazy everywhere else i would've walked away many minutes before. Thankfully another Bachelorette party showed up having the same problem and I had to talk my way into letting 28 cute girls into this bar full of douche bags, assuring them we were about to spend a lot of money inside and we shouldn't have to pay cover. This negotiation took insanely too long and after many disrespectful comments, they finally let us in.  Finally we're in and i need a drink, stat! First bar we walkup to we hear the bartender telling a guy to (excuse my language) \"let's go San Fran, stop being a gay pussy and order a drink already\" cause he had a SF hat on. Along with that, the bathrooms were THE WORST I've ever experienced, anywhere. Puke all over that never got cleaned up, and girls just basically using the stalls to do drugs. So disappointed and will never. Ever. Return nor recommend this place to ANYONE.",

I'd say between about 21-30's.  Not an issue at all, everyone was busy with their friends.   The only hiccup we had was our first night grabbing a drink there we had a waitress who left without telling us. We waited and waited and wondered where she was so we could order another drink. Come to find out she had gone home and didn't close us out nor did she have another waiter take care of us.   The second time in we had a wonderful waitress!

After waiting for a bartender for a few minutes I placed an order for the Sin Burger, I asked for it to be cooked medium well aka NO pink. The burger came out in decent time, but after cutting into it I saw that it was more like a pan seared tuna steak, Unbelievably pink in the middle. I was so hungry and had a guest in from town so I didn't complain, I ate around it. Told the bartender about it and she shrugged her shoulders and said sorry. I know it's not her fault but she could have done something instead of handing me the bill still asking me to pay full price. Boondocks is a great place to hang out and drink but the food service needs attention. I'll still go to the bar but I won't be eating anything other than French fries because you can't fck those up!",

If you can get past what I call the \"Celebrity Service\" (Celebrity Service = when the servers think they are celebrities and care more about talking about themselves and what they look like than caring about the people they are serving), you have a winner.    The atmosphere/games are bad ass.  It's very large and spread out.  Clean. And the food was pure shock and awe for me.

I called ahead, b/c I brought Clyde, my Weimaraner to work today, and wanted to make sure Boondocks is dog-friendly. Jennifer, the bartender, answered and said, \"Absolutely!'  A two-minute walk later, Clyde had a big glass of ice cubes to munch (by request), and then a few minutes later, a big bucket of water  (unsolicited). Jen also brought him 2 dog treats as well. Nice touch! :-)  I'd like to make this all about Clyde, but my chopped salad was fantastic! The dressing was obviously homemade and well seasoned; there was chopped egg blending into the spinach and lettuce mix, portabella mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, and more. I added grilled chicken to the salad, and it was perfect! I couldn't finish the serving, and not for trying. I wouldn't pay $15 for a lunch entree every day (hard NOT to do in Sdl) - but this time, it was worth every dime.   My co-worker had the pork belly sandwich with a huge portion of fries, and he also loved it. He remarked that it was nice to have a menu with a quality and variety of selections worthy of Scottsdale prices.   Clyde perhaps, was not the \"perfect\" guest, as he barked to be given ice cubes. I was worried about his behavior, but no one seemed to mind...  Will be back! Thanks, Boondocks!",

Crowd is of course 'look at me' lame. Beers are poured short and are expensive.  Patio is ok but will get WAY too hot in summer unless they shade it somehow.  Very limited tap beers. All other beers are in a can, which is supposedly for a charity thing but realistically probably getting dumped out back.  Yes there is Cornhole/bags but the bags are so poorly made they leak their pellets all over the patio.   Hard to see this place making it in it's current form.

Scottsdale tends to be snobby and over the top, but Boondocks was the exact opposite. Scottsdale has needed a place like Boondocks for years and finally it has arrived. Everyone was friendly, atmosphere was open with plenty of room to spread out and enjoy your own space, food was fantastic with a wide variety and the best part was the live band and games. We played bags, beer pong, table tennis and dances the night away. We are from Chicago and all bars are like this out there so it was nice to see something in Scottsdale that has the same vibe as our home sweet home Chicago!  Thank you Boondocks for a night of wonderful memories!",

I love the patio; games and performance space on the perimeter and plenty of seating. This place also comes with some of your favorite familiar industry faces which adds to the vibe. Alas, let's dig into the food shall we?   The starters have a versatile range, but the Mac and cheese catches my eye. First, I've never understood Mac and cheese on an appetizer menu. A side? Absolutely. An entree? Sure. An appetizer? I guess I won't argue but it seems kind of off. Anyhow, I get the Mac and cheese that touts 4 cheeses, herb bread crumbs, green chiles and bacon. Yowza that's a lot. I'm expecting a powerful flavor combo, but it falls flat on my palette. I'm in need of a good strong central cheese flavor and less of the frilly add ons. I fear it may be a roux, which can really be tough for Mac and cheese because it can swallow up the flavor of the cheeses.   Moving on I try the St. Pattys burger. I asked for it medium and it came to me well, however it is still fantastic! The Irish cheddar, with the mustard was just the right amount of zing juxtaposed with the fresh lettuce and tomato. Despite being well done, neither flavor nor moisture was lost on the combination of meats in this burger. So so good. Equally delish was the potato salad side dish. Fingerling potatoes in a heavenly creamy sauce with red peppers. I absolutely love red peppers in this potato salad to add that extra kick.   I'm looking forward to coming back to Boondocks to enjoy their patio. While I'm at it I plan to try some of their tacos, and get into some of the red pepper hummus.",

I was with a friend here & she apparently exited the bathroom from the entry point and a guard confronted her for \"trespassing.\" Over and over they said she was trespassing. DUDE ITS A BAR. If you think she's \"trespassing\" card her again to see if she should be in there. She's 28 so LEGALLY she's allowed. She offered to leave through the back exit, but they would not listen to her & forcefully threw her out by literally dragging her to the front exit. Yes, the pics I have attached are what they did to my barely 100 lb friends wrists. UNACCEPTABLE. When she asked to speak to the manager & said she was going to call the cops for how they handled the situation (remember, she had done nothing wrong but apparently leave the bathroom from the wrong exit), he said to her \"Good call them so I can tell them you're trespassing. I love when they come here.\" A tiny little girl leaves the bathroom from the wrong exit and this is what you do to her body? The manager and all of the security involved should be fired.",

They have darts, skee ball, and sometimes they even bust out the N64 for Mario kart!! The wait at the bars can be long and they seem to let certain people skip the line which can be annoying during busy nights.  Last time I was there a girl slipped and fell and a bouncer came running up and proceeded to yell at the woman and kick her out without ever inquiring about wether or not the woman was injured. Her boyfriend then tried to calm the situation and was immediately cussed out by the bouncer. I can't say with certainty wether or not the girl had too much to drink but regardless after the fall she took I would assume the staff would ask if she is ok before proceeding to escort her out of the bar. Unfortunate experience to say the least. During all my other visits I've had enjoyable experiences, hope the next is as well.",

The situation was handled and for that I'm grateful, but I wish I didn't get lectured about not wanting to approach the guy who was harassing me.

I take care of everyone who's ever served me and work in the industry myself and would never come up to someone asking for a tip, especially someone who's not finished enjoying themselves, I'm not tipping you money every hard seltzer you grab me so wait for me to finish drinking and I will tip you just fine, the women who work there need to grow up and stop begging for money to buy more fake Gucci bags.",

    "text": "I love coming to Boondocks on Fridays for Happy Hour. When the weather is nice its an excellent time to have drinks on their Lively patio. I've come here on special events to watch boxing or UFC and although it gets a bit crowded its always a nice time and the energy is great. They have an awesome weekend mimosa special and its very convenient and fast that the servers use an iPad system so you can order and pay very quickly. Occasionally there is live bands performing and always tons of games and activities to do both inside and outside. Great spot for big groups, bday parties, and bar hopping.",

Food is typical bar food and a little overpriced for the serving. A salad and burger with 2 beers and a vodka soda was over $60 which was surprising as I can go anywhere in Scottsdale for brunch at that price. They don't give a copy of the check as it is on a computer but now wondering if she added someone else's drinks to my tab on accident. The kicker is that I had to put my food on a credit card tab and when I closed it I was charge a credit card fee. I asked the waitress as I have never paid a fee at a restaurant and she said it is family owned. I think I paid enough for the food and drinks at full price to not be charged an additional card fee. A little cheesy and I won't be back because of it.",

We don't get the Pac 12 channel!!! Food was good though. Although the chicken Caesar wrap was kinda so so with the wilted lettuce. The best part was our server John!! He was great. We were there most of the day and evening. It got really crowded as everyone trickled in to watch the UFC fight. Glad to see they did not charge a cover. Although, we were there all day and when my husband went outside to run to the car for more cigarettes and asked the front doorman if it was ok, they still wanted to make him stand in line to get back in??? Really, bro? Been here since noon!!! Pay attention to your people. Overall... great patio bar!!!! Great bucket of beer specials, beers are not over priced and they have sugar free red bull too... bonus!!!!",

It's outdoors, the food is good, they have games if that's your thing, and they draw a good crowd.  But they have this terrible bouncer. He's a tall guy, probably 300 pounds, he's not really muscular, has a buzzed head of hair, darker complexion.   Friday night 3/23 I had a bad experience. I was just waiting in line to get in, but when I showed him my ID with my old picture from 2002, he said I should \"cut my hair like in my ID picture, it looks stupid now\". I appreciate a good joke, but this wasn't a joke. He was just taking a dig at me.  Then... once I meet up with my buddies on the inside, my other friend (who has a shaved head and is slightly balding) tells me that the same bouncer gave him a hard time too... for no reason mind you. just said: \"Looks like you're balding\"  I'm not going back there. I'm going to suggest to my friends that they not go back there. I'm going to suggest that strangers not go there either.  Just because of one bad attitude.  Yelp isn't just a place for people to complain, look at my reviews, there are plenty of positive ones. But I think it's a great place for businesses to look at what's working and what's not. This guy is definitely not.",

My husband and I had been driving for days and had finally reached our Old Town destination. We wanted someplace casual that had good food and drinks, someplace we could come down from our \"road buzz\" without a bunch of formality.  We could not have picked a better place to go. Boondocks was perfect!   We sat at the bar and had excellent service with Kaitlyn, who was friendly, prompt and mixed a mean cocktail, exactly what you wish every bartender/server was like . For dinner, we chose several appetizers. The huge standout was the Duck Fat Fries. They were truly amazing, hot, crisp and light with perfect seasoning and dipping sauces. For those who don't like duck (I don't prefer it either), don't worry, they don't taste \"ducky\" at all!   I strongly recommend this place. They have lots of great outdoor seating areas and games too.

    "text": "Sadly this bar is very typical of Scottsdale bars that charge high end prices for food but come up very short. Come in for Monday Football with a friend. Waitress came over within 3 minutes and suggested that it was Cheesy Monday, half off Mac n Cheese or Cheese Bites. Call me simple, who doesn't like a Mac N Cheese plate? Order a Orange Blossom, which tasted flat? I took a couple of more sips and yes indeed it was flat, waitress comes over after 10 minutes, and I tell her that the beer tastes flat, she tells me beer can't go flat? Having thrown a couple of keggers, I know otherwise. She tells me that she is going to ask them to change the keg (yeah right). I got another Orange Blossom and it still tastes flat. I deal with it. Waiting for the Mac N Cheese, I notice that the place isn't that bad of a place to hang out, it could be maybe be a decent alternative to The Lodge, this was before my next experience.  So the Mac N Cheese comes out, The first thing I noticed is that it comes in 2 small skillets, 1 bowl would make clean up a lot easier, but hey I like simple things. My friend and I notice that there is no real cheese sauce on the Mac N Cheese, so we take a bite to see if maybe it is at the bottom. Nope, there is a slim sauce on this so called \"Mac N Cheese\". We ask the waitress, if we ordered Mac N Cheese or some noodles? She tells us, \"we\"ll you don't want too much sauce it will ruin it\". Nope its already ruined. As the menu stated \"Mac N Cheese with cheese sauce, bacon and bread crumbs\" The bacon was fake and bacon that comes in a shaker, which I didn't think they made anymore. She brought out some more sauce, which made it ok. How can you ruin Mac n Cheese? Ask Boondocks because they butchered it. Upon getting our bill, I noticed that the waitress charged us $1.00 for the cheese sauce. Classy move Boondocks. I wont be coming back here, ever again. The menu prices don't justify the food they serve you, I can imagine how the $18 ribs are? No Thanks....",

Service was extremely slow, about ten minutes for two drinks that were literally just liquor with a splash of mixer. If you asked for anything expect to ask two or three times before you received it. The food, the food was just straight bad. Succulent chicken was far from succulent. Burnt small piece of chicken, maybe 3oz at most, and I mean burnt. Almost no whipped goat cheese and a piece of canned red pepper. There were five onion rings, far from a side. And neither were seasoned, the chicken screamed for salt. The chicken wings were bland and needed seasoning too, although the buffalo wasn't too too bad. Barbecue was definitely no go. Tacos were basic and they forgot the cotija cheese and without it they needed salt too. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, to be honest and doubt I'll be back, not in an area that offers much better food and service.",

The place was not busy at all for a weekend night and thought it would be a good place to have a quick drink. After waiting at the bar for a few minutes (which is normal) the female bartender came up and asked us what we wanted. My friend asked a question about the ping pong tables they had, she abruptly answered her and then walked away without taking our order. The bartended then proceeded to service the men at the bar asking if they were ok and if they ended anything else.We tried to get her attention because we were ready to order but she never came back to us or even looked our way! We both stood there confused because we were ready to order and just because we asked a question before we order didn't give her the right to completely disregard us as customers. I don't know if it was because we were female and she didn't think she would get a good tip from us or if she just wanted the men's attention. Who knows! I will never go back to that bar and will not hesitate to let my friends know about the bad customer service either.",

I was speechless!  If that warm reception is not enough for you, go inside for bland food, drinks that never arrive but you have to pay for, filthy bathrooms, bigoted bartenders (I heard multiple slurs thrown around), oh the list goes on.   Pay attention to all of the reviews about the staff being overly aggressive to women and people of color. Boondocks is a garbage place for garbage people.

First of all, they handed our food to the wrong DoorDasher so they had to make our order from scratch and send it out again. We got our food 2 hours after ordering it despite being only 0.8miles away from the bar.   Secondly, half of our food was a mess. The Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich had NO barbecue sauce. Their DoorDash menu said the nachos had mole sauce and no corn, but we got zero mole sauce. Thank goodness the Brussels sprouts & garlic fries were amazing, they are the only reason this review isn't 1 star.",

Great set-up; open air, pool tables, that basketball shot game thing that is in every arcade, a stage for live music, TVs, etc. It is great for people that enjoy having fun and doing things and being fun people that do fun things.  Also, this bar has alcohol, which is a huge plus. Also also, it is way easier to get an uber from here than elsewhere in Old Town, which is also a plus.

There's an uncovered area (outside) where smoking is allowed but due to the downdraft all the smoke comes inside and the place stinks.   The servers in and around the tables were also not very friendly at all. Drink orders were wrong a few times, or forgotten completely. I was charged for a few drinks we never ordered and one of my friends' tabs took 45 min to close out...just a poor experience and a loud annoying one at that. Next time in town I won't waste my time here.",

The only major downfall for me is that they don't have many TVs to watch games on unfortunately. It's a great place to go with a huge group of friends nonetheless. They have tons of games to play, too... pool, table tennis, corn hole, darts, pop-a-shot, ski ball, etc! DEFINITELY come here for a bite to eat and some fun as well. #Boonies",

You are sure to get a seat here every time no matter the night or occasion.  Just be sure you remember the location if you plan on coming back in a year as this place will most likely be named something new.  Most places in old town try to revamp themselves into new and exciting places yet this one fell short again as did its neighbor.  In the 2 years I have been going out in old town Scottsdale these 2 locations will have been 5 different names between the 2 of them!",

That said I've come to watch a game by myself and ended up making several friends at the bar. It has that local hangout kind of vibe that makes it my go to spot for a casual beer.The crowd is pretty mixed and friendly. Wednesday night is county night and a lot of fun. There is live music occasionally with pretty talented musicians. Somehow ended up here on a Saturday night and the ENTIRE bar was singing Michael Jackson songs for some sort of retro night while dancing. Two other times a random pub crawl rolled through in costumes. Seems to always be something fun going on here. Oh, the Pork Belly BLT is AWESOME. Staff is great and seem to know everyone too.",

Not only was every single employee extremely friendly, they brought out cute little dog treats that looked like cookies and a bucket of ice water for my dog.  Our bartender even found an iPhone charger and plugged in my phone, which had died.  The food is much better than your typical bar fare and they have very reasonably priced wine on tap.

Also its a place that gives you option for activities.  Pool, Ping Ping, Sack Toss etc.... And provides the room to do it.     Food is a little pricing for a lunch menu but worth it.  Beers on tap are interesting.  Mixing it up.  Really cool.  Service has been great.  No complaints at all.  Dog friendly is cool.  They take care of the patrons with dogs with ice and water.  Nice touch.    I read some of the other reviews.  Some of them either sound like they are auditioning for Secret Shoppers/Diners or they work for competing venues in Old Town.

My dad and brother were in town so we went here to grab some burgers and beers. The beer buckets came out relatively quick, but we waited for our food for OVER AN HOUR before deciding to leave for another burger joint. Yes, that's right, OVER AN HOUR and the food STILL hadn't come out. We ordered 4 burgers and I was starting to wonder if they had to go out and slaughter the cows or something, it was taking that long. The table to our right which showed up at least an hour after we ordered and the table behind us which showed up at least 30 minutes after we ordered both had their food brought out before ours and the only difference between those tables and us? Well, our party had 3 black people whereas the other tables were all white people.   Like I said, I won't say for sure whether we were treated crappily because of race, but really, there should be no reason whatsoever for me to even get that impression. The waitress was ok (I think her name was Brooklyn), but she should have noticed that we had been waiting for our food for, again, OVER AN HOUR and she should have done something about it. I used to wait tables back in my college days and I never would have let customers just sit for over an hour. The manager (who I'm pretty sure was drunk) should have done more than just give us 50% off of the two beer buckets we ordered. They should have been 100% off considering the HORRIBLE service and experience we had.  My alma mater sometimes has alumni events here, but I will be contacting the president of the alumni association to ensure that future watch parties and alumni events are NEVER held at this place. I have never had such a horrible experience or been treated so terribly in my life. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",

Piss poor service and there were three men walking around which are no servers at all  only one bartender. I came in around 5:45 and left after being completely ignored. The people next to me had the same problem but when they asked one of the guys who isn't a bartender he gave them a drink then walked right by me.",

    "text": "I think boondocks  has a great concept it just fails on execution.  Since it is still relatively new I'm not going to be overly critical, because overall it was a good experience.   Service: 4 stars - the server was very sweet and attentive. There were a lot of people working on a Thursday night but she still managed to make sure that we had everything we needed.   Food: 3 stars- the menu was very intriguing it had a lot of unique options for a bar. Unfortunately when they came out while they looked pretty they lacked in flavor. It was like they just missed the mark on everything.   Atmosphere: I think it's great that they covered up the pool from Spanish fly and opened up the area so it could be a more fun environment, with ping-pong and other games.  The problem is they really didn't update anything else. The bathrooms are still old and dingy and weren't very well-kept.   Overall, I would compare this to a Gilligans... Kind of divey but a good place to go when you want to have a casual drink and hang out with friends.",

Ping Pong Table, Pool Table, 2 Corn Hole Setups, Jenga, Skee Ball...there's no other place in Old Town with that kind of fun atmosphere.  I honestly wouldn't recommend this place for Dinner, or really any other meal.  The food we had was just OK, as was the Service.    Just come in for Happy Hour and play some games.  You'll have a blast.  ENJOY!",

The Inside is small, but they have a Great outdoor area with huge flat screen and several separate bar areas. .... After the fight, great dance music started..  We ate dinner and had drinks over a four hour period.  The nachos were good, and Even though they used liquid cheese, the nachos were not drowning in a heavy vat of fake cheese, like most places serve them, and they were topped off with delicious,  fresh, house made guacamole.   The fried Brussels sprouts were awesome!  Pretzel was large and served hot. Burger was awesome, sweet potato fries were great.... All of our food came out fresh, hot, and rather quickly.  The guys ordered  several buckets of beer each.... ****YUCK ALERT!!!!****They serve Pepsi products.... YUCK! *****.   But I infiltrated my own Diet Coke, and the waitress gave me a glass of ice. I'm the DD, so it's important I have my Diet Coke!   We got there around 7pm for the fight, stayed until around 11pm, before we walked around old town, visiting other clubs.   We left our credit card here, so ended up going back around 1am to pick it up, luckily, I had one diet Coke on reserve, so the guys ordered one more bucket of beer and us four old people sat there and people watched for another 45 minutes, thanking the LORD we were not young and broke anymore.  The music was great and the atmosphere was fun...  Nice mix of people, and a pretty even guy to girl ratio.... Nice looking crowd for the most part.  My husband said he doesn't recommend flip flops, You'll leave with sticky toes... And you won't be able to get into many of the other clubs in flip flops either....I",

    "text": "While patio bars and Scottsdale aren't really my favorite thing, this one is ok.  I prefer this concept to Spanish Fly, mostly because I'm not worried about me shoved into the pool if somebody stumbles into me.  Pros:  Lots of things to do.  Large bar, plenty of TVs, bags (or corn hole if you're from the Midwest), couches and tables.   The appetizers I tried were very good... the Whiskey Wings had a great, unique flavor-though I missed the ranch dressing.  The fried brussels sprouts were quite good, but almost too flavorful for a stand-alone dish... they might do better alongside an entree or salad. Service was good, considering the crowd.  They were prepared for the busy night ahead of them. It doesn't seem too difficult to get a seat ahead of a popular televised sporting event.  Cons:  The setup of our table wasn't great for watching our chosen sporting event, on only one TV at the time.  We couldn't all sit on one side of the table so it was awkward. The fan (that I acknowledge is necessary this time of year) was too high and too loud.  Men don't appreciate how annoying it is to have hair incessently blown into your face to tickle your nose no matter what you do.  I wasn't willing to sit in front of it for the hours we would be there, so the seating options were further restricted. The TVs combined with music and talking were too loud.  Even for a bar.  It was too much. The bills were delivered without the itemized copy. When the server offers to split the check, it should be automatic to itemize.  We weren't sure who got charged for which split items, and couldn't double check for accuracy.",

The live band was amazing and we were able to pass the time by playing a variety of games, like bags. Great bonding. On Thursday nights, they have \"free\" poker.

It's easy to see the remnant layout from Spanish Fly, the previous bar that featured a large pool in the middle. I like what they did with the space - added more tables, an area for cornhole bean bag toss, and ping pong. The bar is large and wraps around with plenty of TV's. I've been here a couple times. The first was to watch a boxing match. It doesn't take long to have a drink in your hand and the standing room comfortably affords crowds.   The second time was on a Saturday morning. A couple guys wanted to have a few rounds of beers and play bags. It was warm out, so despite the outdoor fans and portable AC units, we built up a sweat. We ordered a bucket of Coors light. You get 5 cans for $16. Later we ordered some Corona's. Again, we got cans. I'm not complaining, but glass bottles would have been a nicer touch.   Sometime, I will try the food. My friends' tacos looked pretty good, and they've got a nice selection, though you can't mix and match. Overall, Boondocks is an average watering hole, with nothing particularly memorable about it. But that's not a bad thing! What it offers is a relaxed patio to grab a beer and watch some sports, preferably on a nice day. And sometimes, that's exactly what you're looking for.",

I really enjoy the openness of the patio- but I am afraid to come here summer time! It will be a hot one! I sat where the sun directly hit my eyes, which they need to get a shade for the bartenders & guests.   The staff was pretty nice. And the security was even pleasant ! So that was nice to see smiles & noticed everyone was helping each other.  It was \"carb Sunday\" so we enjoyed their fries & macaroni. Both awesome, fries would of been heaven if they were cooked for a little bit longer.  The place does have some extra  Scottsdale annoyance with the people that go there- but you will find that anywhere in Oldtown!  They have a bunch if different games to play with groups which I noticed everyone loved.  I will be back, and I hope a lot!",

    "text": "Boondocks is a Modern Sports Bar that has a really Big Patio with High Top Tables, Ping Pong tables, TVs and other Games. Many but not all the drinks on the cocktail menu feature fresh squeezed Grapefruit Juice.   They offer lots of interesting appetizers and shareable plates and they also have a Children's Menu. The menu had a wide assortment of sandwiches and all kinds of interesting burgers.   Many things sounded interesting and I went with the Bibi Burger. I was sold on the Harissa and Raisin Marmalade and ordered it being not sure about ground turkey. But it was delicious! The Turkey was cooked like it should be but was flavorful and juicy and I really liked that spicy and sweet taste with the Turkey.   My husband had the Sin Burger and it was really delicious too. It had Jalapeno Marmalade, Pickled Cabbage, Cheddar Cheese and a blistered Jalapeno on a four grind beef patty. For his side he picked the potato salad and it was good too.  The Burgers are very solid here.  I'm not sure if they offer any full dinners here as it seems to be just a very casual menu.  Service was very good.  They are open 7 days a week for 11-2am  I'd return.",
