    "text": "Went on a Wednesday night and waited for 45 minutes with my wife and daughter who's 2.  There was No1 ahead of us and still waited that long which is even more brutal.  Let's start with the menu....everything is served a la Carte so they can fuck you for the maximum with ordering sides....which would be fine if it was an upscale place or if the food was even remotely good which it is neither.  First thing we ask is if they have a kids menu in which they said no but we can make a grilled cheese, a cheeseburger or a chicken sandwich served with fries.  We opted for the kids grilled cheese.  When the grilled cheese arrived it was somehow made out of an upside down burger roll which I can't even explain and I would rate the fries a 3 out of ten and only because they were luke warm and in the same shape as a French fry.  Next I ordered the roasted chicken which came with no sides so I opted for the truffle mashed potatoes and my wife ordered the kale ceaser with salmon.  When my chicken arrived it took me 3.5 bites to eat the entire piece and the mashed potatoes were not even blended.....both had some flavor but all around a horrible meal for the price.  Next comes the wife's salmon which was extremely salty and the salad was covered in cheese.  All around brutal dining experience and will never be back.",

I was with two buddies and we were just going to grab a quick bite and a couple of drinks before we headed out for the evening. So we decided to have the 'Tomahawk' steak entree sliced and shared. Great choice.  After a few cocktails we passed on desert and were on our way... I would have to say that the experience was flawless.  It's exactly what I wanted in a steak house, this place nailed a fun atmosphere and great food without the pretentiousness of the other steak and burger options in old town. Highly recommended.",

Our filets, pork chops, grilled salmon, and steaks were all cooked to perfection and NOT way over seasoned like the (supposedly) high end steak houses seem to love. Entrees are \"a la carte\" with a number of great sides to share. We had the wonderful garlic mashed potatoes, tasty grilled asparagus, and delicious sweet potato fries. Garlic use was as a spice or herb, not a main course like too many other chefs seem to think is good.  High end bar look but sophisticated decor. Prices a third less than the high end steak houses but food is better. Happy Hour also has great deals. Attentive wait staff and owner/manager twice stopped to check on us.  Definitely will go back.",

We sat at the bar and I had a great time watching the bartenders show their skills! Their cocktails look amazing, I want to try them all! Luckily they had a good IPA on tap for my BF too.   We ordered the salt and vinegar fries, cali burger with fried egg and the mushroom burger. I like salt and vinegar chips so I was very intrigued with their salt and vinegar fries! It was amazing, but what even made it better was the house ranch that came with it.  I liked the cali burger better than the mushroom. I thought that the balsamic was too overwhelming. I felt like it was overpowering the burger. I still enjoyed my meal though!   Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "Seriously disappointed. I was expecting so much more from this place. What really pains me is the how much it costs to eat here, I would have expected way better than what I got. I ordered the filet, which is the cut of steak I always order at other places. I like my filet cooked medium well, so I order it butterflied. This allows for the steak to cook in the center. Since a filet is a thick cut of steak, it's hard for the center to cook in the center so if you cut the steak horizontally the steak is spreading it over a larger surface into thinner cuts. Well apparently the person that cooked my steak didn't understand that because when I got the steak, it was cut down the middle, vertically! It was all I could do to keep from laughing. Because of this the steak was very rare...so much blood inside the steak. I sent it back and it came back a little more cooked, but still way too bloody. So $36 for a steak that I couldn't even finish. I ate the pieces of the steak (toward the ends) which were cooked properly. The pieces of the steak that I could eat was exceptional. If only I could have enjoyed my whole steak. I also ordered a baked potato. Hen I started to eat it, I noticed something black in it. I cut it down the center and discovered it was rotten inside. How did they not notice this when they put it on my plate?! They rectified the potato situation by giving me mashed potatoes. The service was very good. However when I pay $36 for a steak and have to order the sides a la carte, then my food needs to at least be delivered to my table how I ordered it, and not be rotten. I'd been better off going to Texas Roadhouse...at least they know how to properly butterfly and cook a steak.",

Food: Great burgers on par with many other specialty burger places in the area.  Very yummy but didn't blow me away.  For the price I expected it to blow me away.   Fries: Are served separately from the burger.  They were good but with how many specialty sauces they have on the menu for the burgers you would think they would take it one step further and serve it with a house sauce of some sort.  Good.  More a place I think I would want to hang out for a late night lounge more than a lunch meal though.",

    "text": "I love it when someone introduces me to a new restaurant. I had never heard of Hand Cut Burgers until my buddy took me hear after a stroll through the Scottsdale art walk. They are located next to the Scottsdale Waterfront across from Scottsdale Fashion Square. Riot Hospitality Group (EL Hefe, Dierks Bentley) is the brains behind this concept. Hand Cut really pushes clean eating and uses locally produced 100% grass-fed beef (no hormones or antibiotics) for their burgers. Recently their California Burger placed in a burger competition. During evening hours they are a full service chophouse that uses high quality meats. Burgers run around $10 but you can grab their B.F.D. deal around lunchtime and get fries and a drink added in for the same price. Check in on Yelp and get a free side of their salt & vinegar fries. The fries are pretty amazing and the dill topping really adds to the flavor. I ordered the Jalapeno Ranch Burger and found the burger really fresh and delicious. They really make a good burger here and I highly recommend trying one of them. I sat at the bar and thought our bartender was very knowledgeable and passionate about his job. The restaurant itself is beautiful with an open kitchen and butcher prep area so you can watch them prepare their meats. Menu is limited to burgers and fries during late hours and they have a nice selection of craft beers, cocktails & fine wines. They use meat cleavers as handles on their front door which adds to the experience of visiting here.",

They need filtered water ASAP it was truly so gross that I didn't have another sip the whole night. They were also very eager to clean up the table before we had an opportunity to finish.   Their hand cut fries were really good and the mushroom burger was great too. They also have a dessert for birthday celebrations with ice cream sandwiches and candy with sparklers!!! $24  It's a nice place and I will be back but that water is a   Deterrent for sure.",

The wings and fried zucchini were delicious and the hand-crafted cocktails were impressive. The bar was tiny and the bartenders seemed to be stumbling all over each other. Personally I would knock out the ice cream bar (which wasn't being used), shift some tables around, and expand the bar.  Overall Hand Cut was amazing, I definitely recommend!",

The ambiance was great service wasn't horrible. Their drink menu looked really new and interesting, though we didn't try any. We did order a glass of wine that was the smallest portion and definitely not 6 ounces. Hopefully after some time of being open things will change.

Kids choices were available upon request: Mac n cheese (minus breadcrumbs upon request if your kids are anything like mine) crispy chicken sandwich grilled chicken sandwich hamburger cheeseburger chicken tenders all with fries (except Mac n cheese).   Loved the Matador cocktail and zucchini tempera fries.   Would recommend printing the kids menu so they can ponder their choices and not bug mom to repeat 100 times - always confuses me why more restaurants don't offer butter and Parmesan noodles and pizza for kids which is what mine always ask for (seems like they'd have a fantastic profit margin )",

Salmon was inedibly salty, beet salad was bland and my pork chop was concerningly undercooked (of course they were happy to reheat/Cook). The highlight of the meal was their cocktails and the salt and vinegar fries (these are delicious!!) which come free with a yelp check-in! I don't regret eating here but wouldn't go back given the price and food quality.   P.S. would be a great first date spot! Cool vibe, great drinks = good times!",

Service is quick, music and Dj is so fun and upbeat, and food is amazing and always served fresh! Prices are always reasonable, especially dining in Fashion Square area!   My first time there, my mom and I got free drinks because promoters were going around buying random drinks. How sweet! We also got to meet the manager Alexandra and she is AMAZING as well as all of our servers that we have had.   My second time there, the service was just as good as the first time. Even though we didn't get free drinks, the drink specials during happy hour were great.   My times after have stayed consistent and the manager even knows us now because we come as often as possible. I picked this place for my birthday dinner last night and they did a huge candle/fire thing when they brought my cake out and I felt so special!   If you are looking to have dinner with a friend, or a date night, or a birthday dinner, or happy hour, or just want to have drinks at night but don't want to go out in Oldtown, I HIGHLY recommend Hand Cut Burgers and Chophouse",

I do like that you can upgrade your burger to a grass fed burger but really nothing jumps out on this menu as exciting. If the menu offered more variety I'd give this place another try.  The salt and vinegar fries taste fake like the seasoning is a powder and something that would be used on Lays potato chips. They are just too overpowering and the powder texture is funky on the palette.   Burgers lack creativity and just overall menu lacks zest and excitement. The decor and layout of this restaurant is  aesthetically pleasing but the menu doesn't reflect that feel or vision. Drinks were ok but nothing stands out food or drink wise  Very friendly service great location Lux design and layout but menu needs an overhaul.",

    "text": "Excellent food, excellent service!   On Wednesday evening, my husband and I as well as his cousins met here for dinner. Since I don't go to Scottsdale much during the week, I was surprised to see that he restaurant was kinda busy on a week day. The menu is not extensive but they have a nice selection of steaks, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and sides. Everything is served a la carte, so there are no \"meals\". Instead, you order the burger for example, and you have to order the fries separately if you want the burgers and fries combination. The burgers are priced very reasonably at $9+ I ordered the classic kind of burger. The steaks are a bit more pricey at around $36 for the most expensive one. 2 of us ordered steaks and 3 ordered the burgers. We ordered three different burgers, all of which turned out to be delicious. The steak, based on what I got as feedback from my husband's cousins was superb! We also ordered the salt and vinegar fries on the side, the onions rings and the truffle mashed potatoes, all of which I thought were excellent.   We were all very pleased with the quality of the food. The prices were also average. One thing that I really liked is the way our dishes were served. 3 waiters served all our food at the same time. I thought that was very cool!   I will definitely be returning to try more of their menu options particularly, their steak!",

So we got our spots at the bar, we were greeted quickly and our drinks appeared like magic.  They need to install those purse hanging thingy to the bar, so you can put your purse somewhere.  We got: 1.  Spinach & artichoke dip - It was pretty good and the toasted ciabatta were good accompanies. 2.  Salt & vinegar fries - OK, these are to die for. Crispy and the fresh dill was a good touch.  House ranch was delicious.   3.  Hand cut classic burger - I have to say one of the best burgers I had in awhile.  Juice, taste like beef, flavors are all there, cooked to perfection, and the buns were soft.    We were well taken care of from the three staff members at the bar, never had to ask for more refills.  I need to come back for some steak!",

This is exactly what happened to us last night...and they don't even bother checking on us and we were there right in front of these hostess there were 2 of them.  Also, after about 45 minutes of waiting  they only offered that there are community tables available.  Not even bothering to let us know that there were outdoor seating available also.  So after finally got seated after an hour, an additional 10 minutes we had to wait because no server even bother to come over to offer us drinks or acknowledge us.  Only then when the hostess saw my frustration on my face she told the waitress to come and see us.    We are done with this place!",

I got there for lunch and sat right up at the bar. They weren't too busy but their happy hour starts at 3 so I could see it getting busy after work! I had the chicken melt with a side salad and it was amazing! I will definitely try one of their burgers and fries next time! Wait staff was very attentive and even asked if I wanted a water to go considering how hot it was! This place has a very cool vibe and they have quite a few TVs (great for watching a game which enjoying happy hour and great food!).",

First thing you notice when you come in is the upbeat, exciting decor and overall ambiance of the restaurant. You can tell they are striving to be an affordable and welcoming chophouse for everyone without sacrificing the quality of the food. All the staff are very friendly and chill, which makes dinner a laid back and stress free experience, something hard to come by from other high end spots in Scottsdale.  Their Happy Hour is AMAZING! You can't beat the half off appetizers (wings and spin dip are to die for) and discounted signature cocktails. They make like half a dozen different types of ice cubes that they use in their drinks, super fun and unique. Whoever is in the kitchen though is always cooking up the best food. Their burgers are all delicious, but the filet is unmatched. It's super simple but still crazy buttery, tender, and flavorful!!   I highly recommend checking this place out and seeing for yourself just how amazing they are!",

So the first time I came here, because my husband really wanted a burger, I was ready for disappointment. But they have the BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH I have ever had. The peach slaw on it is to die for. Die.   We've since been back when I wanted a burger and it's basically perfect. The happy hour is great. The drinks have really neat looking ice cubes with fruit in them- long rectangular ones, spheres- very cool looking. And the decor is so amazing. I'm a designer and I had to ask who did their interior decor, that's how good it is.   I've had the steak, too, but honestly... it's not as good as the burgers. My one sour note is the veggie burger. I thought, since they had such a great chicken sandwich, I could bring my vegetarian friend and his hamburger loving wife here. He said the veggie burger was awful, but the zucchini fries and regular fries were so good he didn't care so much.   Impress a date. With hamburgers.",

Flavor was decent.  Ordered Medium Rare, came out over.  I can get over that.  Ordered Salt/Vinegar fries and Ranch Onion Rings....  Watched my fries sit on the pass through for about 6 minutes.  When they arrived, cold.... Sent back (if your going to indulge the calories.... they must be hot) when they came back....  just regular fries  (but hot).  Not a MUST for the burger options, but will give one more try for the Chophouse component at nighttime.",

All the staff was super attractive and nice.   We all had some form of burgers, appetizers, beers, and a bottle of wine. The fries were a little salty, but other than that the ambience was nice, a great location. Look forward to going back.",

    "text": "oh man.... where do I even start. I had a HORRID experience here.   I walked in with my husband soon after they opened the doors one morning. As we made our way to the bar to sit down I noticed that the ENTIRE STAFF was on the phones, hanging out back near the kitchen.. Granted they had just opened for the morning, but there is no excuse for everyone to be on there phones as customers are entering the restaurant. So... We sit down and make ourselves comfortable. Now we wait.... wait for the bartenders (2 guys) get their faces out of their phones and acknowledge our presence. FINALLY one of them put their phone down grabbed us some menus and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. I told him we would start with waters and as soon as our other friend showed up that we would order cocktails. We received our waters and about 5 min later my friend showed up. She sat down after greeting us and looked over at the bartenders to ask for a water and an additional menu. After about 3 min which felt like eternity!!! she looked over at me and asked if she was dreaming. I responded nope just wait and watch.. She did. The two bros behind the counter whom where talking about how hard they partied and all the girls they were seeing the night before completely ignored the fact that we could hear their whole conversation and my friend finally lost her patience and said \"Excuse me but can I please get a menu and some water?!?\" The same one who gave us water prior, apologized and brought her over a water and menu, then turned back around and continued talking to his bro. They continued to sit behind the bar on their phones and gossip. Finally a manager came over and asked them both to go do something, they did but then she (the manager) walked back over towards the kitchen and pulled out her phone and started showing other staff photos on her phone and laughing about who knows what.   We finally ended up ordering or drinks and food 15min later. When the food came out I was SOOO excited to eat because I finally had food in front of me after waiting forever. I took my first bite (a French fry) and NOOOOOOO! It was so salty that I couldn't even eat it!! Next I tried my burger. It was cold :( not frozen or anything but defiantly under room temperature! like it had been sitting in the window forever) I flagged down the bartender and asked him if they could please heat my burger up for me and grab me some new fries. He didn't say anything grabbed my plate and walked back to the kitchen. He then came back over and told me that the kitchen was going to make me a fresh new burger. Well, once I received that new plate (both people i'm with at this point have already finished their meals) I had two or three bites of my average burger and just gave up. It was bland and blahhhh... Nothing good about it! The fries again were way over salted. Both my husband and my friend said their dishes were average and nothing worth writing how about.    Needless to say I'm not impressed with this place. I think there needs to be some majors training sessions with the staff and they have to step up their game!! I'm going to give it a few months before I give it another shot. I was really excited for this place, too bad it missed the mark for me.",

Even though it took several tries to get it right I appreciated the fact that she cared . I may not have gotten the best meal but the service was priceless , I believe that the food is good on its own merits but the customer service was something that means a lot when going out and you  want to have an enjoyable evening . Thank you again Jessie for taking the time to care how my experience was at your restaurant. We plan to come back again when I return in October to try the porkchops !!",

We sat down and we were prompted by a server who took our drinks. She was clearly new as she had a person shadowing her the entire time.  We gave her a chance and her trainer too.   The reason why I'm giving three stars is because of the dinner we ordered six or seven main courses one of them being a $54 phone in New York steak that came out completely well done when we asked for medium rare. The other dishes also came out not to our preferance as the salmon piece was broken up and not one whole piece. As we were telling our waitress that the state was hard she said that she would discount the steak and tell her manager.   Well, nothing happened.   On top of that, The fire alarm went off in the middle of our dinner and lasted for 9 minutes.  Fire truck came and everything.  The place was dead that night. It never filled up.",

Average to below average on taste, service, and selection. Onion rings reminded me of the ones you buy in a box, keep in the freezer, and reheat on a cookie sheet. Could be a great place in a great location but then it would need to improve on almost everything. It's not very full, even at peak times, and there's a reason. Save your money or pick from one of the many other neighborhood choices.",

I got a burger and my boyfriend got a steak. Steak was too rare & got sent back, but the burger and baked potato were decent. Spinach & artichoke dip was really good! Very nice & attentive staff that made sure we got what we wanted! All together our bill was about $80 and I would say for the price it wasn't worth it, nothing too special about the food.",

Our table got the salt and vinegar fries (one of my favs) and also tried the truffle mashed potatoes and the sweet potato gratin, both were phenomenal. I ordered the veggie burger which was different than your average veggie burger, in the best way possible. Very flavorful with hints of sweetness. I have also had a few of their other burgers which are just as tasty! Oh... and the blackberry Mojito was like an adult snow cone. Couldn't be more perfect for a hot Arizona summer day!",

Flavor was very mild, didn't notice the hint of lemon.  Service: 4/5 restaurant was fairly quiet this evening but not all items were attended to right away and various small items were left out (debris under the bar, steel knife sharpener in the kitchen area on the south side, no hostess the last 90 minutes of opening, etc.)",

Water and unsweetened tea has its own section. The tea is delicious must try. The decoration is gorgeous. I ordered the kale salad which had Parmesan cheese, broccoli, collieflower and I decided to add chicken. The salad dressing was Caesar and it came with some soft croutons which are delicious.

The zucchini was cooked and tender and the outside was still crispy, which is not always the case at other places. The 8 oz filet was excellent and cooked perfectly. You're able to order your burger with a lettuce wrap, which is a nice option to cut down on some calories if you want. We ordered the Mushroom & Cheddar burger and the California Burger which were both very good. You can tell the beef is high-quality. The asparagus and snow peas as sides were great sides to have and had unique flavors. The onion rings were nice and crispy and had great flavor as well.

We've had almost every burger on the menu at this point, but honestly my absolute favorite is their original burger. Their beef is hand packed and super fresh, as are their toppings and buns. We also love their sweet potato fries & their salt & vinegar fries! One single serving for two people is PLENTY as the portion is pretty hardy. Great addition to the neighborhood!",

I got their variation of a french dip or steak sandwitch was pleasantly surprised. Great flavors and great appetizers to share. They are typically busy and staff is running around. The atmosphere is interesting as well, outside they have a farm like ambiance, with fake animals and fake grass and inside there are some trendy chandeliers.",

Needless to say, this place provides great service. 3 stars because the food was a-okay..... I ordered a jalapeno grass fed burger that really lacked flavor. I had to ask for  a side of ranch to give it an extra kick. Probably should have ordered the California burger instead. The wings were my favorite out of all the food choices we got including artichoke dip and salt & vinegar fries.  The drinks were all pretty crafty and unique but next time I'll play it safe and order wine. 1/2 off bottles on Tuesday and you can take them to go!  Lastly, the decor is what brought me inside in the first place. The cute sheep statues and trees manicured into the shapes of bears is sooo adorable. Not sure if I'd return as there are many delicious places to try in Scottsdale but would recommend others give it a chance.",

Has nice big booths and tables with the bar in the middle. Tv's above the bar and everyone watching Thursday Night football. I would say that the place is pretty loud with a lot of energy in the place.   We started out with the free salt & vinegar fries with a Yelp check-in and tempura Zucchini fries. Really good but everyone thought the zucchini fries were the best. Thick cuts of zucchini that was cooked perfectly. Soft in the middle and very tasty. The salt & vinegar fries were good too. I would say they were medium sized and nice and firm. Just how I like it. So I was a happy.   I had the mushroom cheddar burger with an egg on top. The burger was good. Ok I guess. The bun was nice a firm. Burger was cooked perfectly. Nothing special. I would say good not great.   My wife ordered the chicken melt sandwich. Didn't try it but she said it was good. She only ate half and took the rest home. She didn't complain and that's good. Both my daughter and son got the California burger. They ate it all. Didn't complain. So I guess it was good. My son been here a few times so he does enjoy this place.   Service was pretty good. Our server was nice and friendly. Since this was our first time here, she explained their menu to us. She was pretty busy but still was able to fill up our water glasses. Only problem was that the kitchen was very slow. Took awhile for our fries to come out. It even longer for our burgers. We actually finished all our fries before our burgers came out.   So overall I really liked the ambiance. Loud, modern, trendy, somewhat hip, and relaxing. Friendly service with good food. Not great but good. Had better burgers but it's the experience. We enjoyed it. Hope you do too.",

Because the cocktails are so fun, they take longer to make, which was fine.  We were not in a hurry.  I ordered the mushroom/cheddar burger with a veggie patty.  It was really good.  My only complaint was that they put the arugula under the patty so it was all wilted by the time I got it.  Their fries are crunchy; I personally prefer them a bit softer, but really tasty.

I need to get a silicone ice cube tray because they had some awesome ice cube game going on.  I went for the pulled brisket grilled cheese and it was amazing.  The house wings were started with were very tasty.  It was a great time and I'd head back in an instant.

    "text": "Apparently, the difference between excellent vs. lackadaisical/non-existent  service is night & day...literally.   We're regulars always patronizing this location on weekend days. For three years, we've been trying to make the Tuesday night half-off all meat-cuts menu starting at 18:00. Traveling from Gilbert (45 minutes with traffic) we arrived approximately 19:05. Despite several tables being available for inside dining, the wait was \"50 minutes.\" One table was available outside, so, we asked if service was available at that table. Answer: \"yes.\" Approximately 25-30 minutes after being seated, no one had greeted us or taken drink orders (despite the manager helping us move a heater to our table; so they knew we were there). Eventually, the manager herself took our drink order; as of this writing no server has come to our table AN HOUR LATER.   Suffice it say we'll never make the trek for dinner again during weeknight traffic; not sure we'll return on the weekend either, despite how much we like this eatery. Clearly, the front of the house is improperly staffed, if not, then ownership needs a clue (if they even care). The back of the house is equally challenged as our entrees have yet to arrive.  The real kicker is, every time we've come during the day we're being sold on Tuesday night gig. Staff should take care to instruct patrons to make reservations, and we should've known better...  Edit: the manager, recognizing our bad experience, offered to pick up the tab for the food we did manage to order (I didn't eat I was so put-off). I refused, she insisted...",

One issue I have is that the restaurant could be half full and they act as if there is a line out the door, but for the price (peep my pro-tip below) you really can't find a place that offers steaks for these prices.  Pro-tip: come on Tuesdays, the steaks are half off and the wine is also reduced.",

This local brew really had a great balance of vanilla and blueberry while maintaining it's wheat identity.  The ambiance of this place, however, is quite puzzling. It's like it can't decide if it wants to be upscale, hipster or just plain out there. It has multiple different floorings, including faux grass, some gaudy gold light fixtures and green ceiling paint, but then booth cushions that look like a big blanket is draped over each one. Still perplexed, but would still stop in for some additional brews and maybe some apps.",

    "text": "The most amazing food I have had in Scottsdale.   I lived in Scottsdale for 8 years, and hated going out because a lot of times I was stuck between going to Olive and Ivy or The Montauk for dinner as those were the only places with great food and decor. I recently moved to LA, but my last day in AZ, I decided to try this restaurant which I always saw but never went in.   I hate myself now for not coming in sooner. Seriously delicious!   Ordered the beets and burrata, fried zucchini (AMAZING) , steak, mashed potatoes, asparagus and Mac n cheese. Seriously amazing.   Like I am drooling thinking of how good it was.   Service was ehh and the server wore a bra top.. I mean I don't really want my food touching your belly button piercing. But honestly the food was so good, that it didn't matter.",

The flat iron steak was good too but not even close to the other two. I would go again and tell a friend.",

Decided on the classic burger with the salt and vinegar fries.  Burger was cooked to perfection.  Grass fed is definitely the way to go here.  One of the best i have had.  Fries were tasty without being too salty.  Great experience.  Will go back for a repeat.",

Everything we ordered minus one steak was apparently for the table behind us so they removed it from our table then gave it to the table behind me (yes, I cringed a bit but they made up for it) Tons of mistakes were made, thus the wine was flowing. We expected a $105 tab and when it arrived we found out that they discounted the entire thing to $35. Quite the redemption and I'll definitely return because of it.",

    "text": "UPDATE at bottom  This place is suppose to have really good burgers...well mine was just a little dry and not tasty enough. Simply overcooked when I asked for a medium.  All the burgers on the menu sound really good and interesting but it just wasn't cooked correctly.  The burgers are the price of most other places except this place doesn't give you a side i.e. fries. Maybe I just need to give this place a second chance but I don't know if I will since my burger didn't even come with a side..  UPDATE:  I went in for a second time just recently.  I originally rated this place 3 stars simply because I thought it was over priced for a over cooked burger.  Well I went in for a second time and I made sure to order quite a lot of different drinks and food items. I had a amazing experience that I had to update my review.  First of all, I ordered smoked salmon off of their appetizers and just because of them I will absolutely be a repeat customer from now on.  It was so fresh and good and a really big portion.  Salt and vinegar fries are a simple appetizer order but really good and sharing portion.  I got wings off of the appetizer menu as well and that also was generous in portion and it was a light rub and it was really good but I do personally like my wings smothered in sauce.  Still good and will order them again.    That was all the food we could handle because we happen to be there during happy hour so we ended up ordering lots of drinks one after another because we were so curious to try them. They all sounded really good and we got to try around 6+ different drinks and they were all interesting and good in their own way.  My very first drink however (The Gardener) was a little watery and I didn't like it so much but our server offered to switch it out which was awesome of her.  I do want to go back and try more food items and drinks. Until then, I will post some pictures of our most recent visit.",

We were greeted and sat immediately. Service was good, in fact the one thing I did notice is that they weren't rushing us out of there like some burger joints do. We had time to visit and enjoyed it. We indulged in the macaroni carbonara as a shared appy. Delicious! We shared the Cobb salad, a blue cheese burger and the salt and vinegar fries. I really wasn't in the mood for fries until I tasted these. And then I couldn't stop eating them. Everything was fantastic. I will be back because I need to try the short rib melt and the onion rings- I spied some at another table and they looked excellent.",

The menu is your average steakhouse menu with good cuts of meat and family style sides. I check in on Facebook and I see a review that says \"you have to get the chopped salad. I'm watching my calories trying to get ready for pool season so I go for it and add salmon. The salad arrives 35 minutes later and it's not a chopped salad at all in fact my friend says \" it's a chop salad you have to chop yourself\" it's a freakin DIY chopped salad! What ruined it for me was it was filled with arugula...can I just pause and talk about how arugula is literally the weed of lettuces?! Who eats arugula? Stop putting the foot weed of lettuces in peoples food. So anyway there's basically 3 bites of salmon and a pound of arugula that's has leaves big enough for me to drape myself in and 3 blueberries and this does not a chop salad make. #Fail I'll probably come back but just for HH drinks the food sucks",

Our table ordered 4 entrees and only one person was satisfied and appeased by their meal. I can only personally speak for my dishes, the lobster mac and cheese was not anything to rave or crave; it was noodles with a subpar bechamel. Did I mention it was lobster mac and cheese? Well there was not a piece of lobster to be found, but it did have an overly powering essence of seafood, that reminded me of a mothers tuna casserole. I ordered the 18oz bone in NY strip, it was a decent steak but again nothing Overly special; for myself nothing was overly satisfying, and this will more then likely be my first and last visit.",

I will not be returning to hand cut for a long time unless something changes. I have noticed over the visits the burgers have gotten drastically smaller, the old fashioned has a mid level bourbon that is priced cheaper on the back of the menu rather than in the drink on the front of the menu. Yet when you order the same drink with a different bourbon it is priced to the alcohol. the service is sub par. After being sat on my most recent my wife had asked for a high chair for our daughter it took 3 requests to get one when there was a maximum of 8 covers in the restaurant... i guess you could consider that \"busy\" for the service staff there? Because that is what it seemed like... there was a hair in my drink and instead of taking care of the drink, an appetizer was taken off the bill which is at least an effort, but I guess it's cheaper to drive up food cost when alcohol is always marked up more than the food. And my burger was undercooked I asked for a medium and it came out rare-medrare. The center of our desert was cold. And the ice cream had crystals in it from refreezing. Overall I will not be recommending it to friends.",

It was a friends birthday last night, first time I've ever been there. Service was terrible (won't mention name), she took forever for everything, I had to stop her before she left for her to take my order. When she brought my food to the table she said she be back soon to check on me and to make sure the temperature was good. She never came back!! My steak was definitely not medium, only the middle was medium well at best and the rest of the steak was well done! I got the ribeye and it was almost as chewy as a sirloin! Thank god the Steaks were half off since it was Tuesday, couldn't justify paying for the meal otherwise... they charge almost as much if not the same as mastros or Ruth's Chris!! Wanted to talk to a manager but being my friends birthday and already only paying half off I really didn't want to make a big deal about it. The burgers on the other hand looked awesome and were reasonably priced. My cocktail was crafty but at $13 (more then the burgers) slightly ridiculous. If I were ever to come back, which I probably won't, I would go strictly to try the grass fed burgers! Don't try the steaks! If I ever payed 34 dollars for that steak I'd punch myself!",

I asked another couple to join us & reservations were made for Saturday evening at 6:30pm. The best thing about the place was we got right in at our reservation time. The decor is really well done, televisions for watching college football which was perfect for the guys. The great experience stopped there. We ordered drinks from the specialty drink menu, they were served in glasses that looked like they were child sized. For $12 I could take 3 sips and finish the drink, total rip off! We all ordered burgers and when they arrived, all four were not cooked as ordered. Two of us ordered well done and the burgers arrived medium/rare, the other two arrived rare and were ordered medium. My husband sent his back & we all ate what was served (didn't want to wait) a half hour later no burger ever arrived for my husband. At that point, he just said forget it & ate some of the side dishes, which were also very small servings & just ok tasting. The classic burger which I ordered did not even come with a tomato, I had to ask for it to be added & was charged! I realize they just opened a month ago & usually give a new restaurant 6 months before going, but thought how hard can it be to cook a burger they way you ask?? If they can't get that simple task accomplished, then they don't have a prayer. They will do well because of the location, but as a local, I will stick with Zinburger!!",

The ambiance is casual for the quality of food,  which works for people who zigzagging just came for a burger and onion rings. Did two of my friends order steaks medium rare and get them medium... yes. Did they fix it when asked, yes. So customer service was a plus. The truffle mashed potatoes deserve attention, but if you come only once the venison is the dish of choice. The bar has room for those who want a beer and time to watch a game. This restaurant maybe just doesn't quite know what it is, but everything it does is done well.   If you give it a chance it will be worth your time. Check it out then decide.",

We order the venison, surf and turf, salt and vinegar fries, kale cesar salad and drinks... OMG! we couldnt be more satisfied than anything. The venison and surf and turf was perfectly cooked and tender. The kale salad, one of the best cesar salad in my life Drinks were lovely as well. Totally recommended. Nice place for dinner for sure.",

    "text": "I passed by this restaurant on my many torturous trips to the mall. I finally got the opportunity to dine here and the my high expectations were not met. I was under the impression this was going to be a high end steakhouse; not the case. The women staff although very attractive give this a establishment a Hooters meets Texas Roadhouse. I had the Kale Caesar salad which was probably the worst dish of the night. It lacked flavor and something else to make it satisfying. The vinegar fries were surprisingly very tasty. They were full of flavor and tasted like fried chicken crust if that makes sense. The sides I had were the Mac N' Cheese and truffle mashed potatoes. Mac N' Cheese was the business. They were extremely cheesy and flavorful. Mashed potatoes had too much butter for my taste. The main entree was the 8 OZ filet. The steak was perfectly balanced and savory; similar to those at legit high end steakhouses. The food was pretty decent but the identity crisis and clothing attire gave it more of a sports bar kinda of feel instead of a steakhouse. Would I return....possibly not.",

    "text": "Oh man, this is a tough one... I so badly wanted to love this place!! But at the end of the day, my honest review is three stars with room for improvement.   So the positives: great, inviting decor! It's visual candy from the lighting to the flooring and overall style. It's such a fun vibe!! The cocktail I had was DEVINE!!!! I can't remember the name, something fruit with banana foam?! Delicious!! And the menu selection had everything you would expect for an upscale burger joint (fries and Mac n cheese, etc.).  The service was good and fast. Although our waitress was suggesting too many things... she kept trying to push a menu item, I can't recall which one, but we just didn't want it.  Oh, and when we first got there we ended up having to wait around 15+ mins to get seated, it was busy, but once we got back to the dining area, it wasn't packed and there were a lot of open tables. Just weird to wait so a while, when there was immediately available seating.  My main negative comment was the food was just so very bland. Like... everything we tried needed salt added to it. Maybe it was just an off night... but it was a total let down. You just kinda expect the tastes to match the visuals.   Once we added salt to our burgers and apps, everything tasted better.   I don't know if I'd ever go back specifically for the food...  but I'd def bring some gal pals out to try the drinks. Still a fun experience. Just hope the food is seasoned better next time.",

Our waitress pleasantly greeted us, gave us our waters and and we didn't see her again until after we had already ordered.  She took so long to come back and take our order, I looked lost looking around for her, another nice lady helped us.  It wasn't even busy.   Food took a long time to come out for a place that was practically empty.  Smoked salmon wasn't what we expected, sweet potato fries tasted funny.  We literally ate just our rib eye ALONE!  Baked potato and garlic fries came late and as I was STILL EATING the waitress came by and picked my plate up not once, but TWICE!!  As if we were being rushed out of there.  I was focused on having a good night with my boyfriend without the drama, I usually would call it quits as she touched my plate with her hands and I was still eating.  They weren't even getting ready to close.  This is the worst experience I've ever had.  Still paid $87 for a horrible experience and basically 2 rib eyes.  One which I didn't even get to finish bc the waitress touched my plate.  Actually I didn't even finish my food as I felt disgusted and rushed.",

Parking is okay just grab a spot inside one of the parking garages, otherwise you may go around a few times on the street. Decor is industrial farmhouse which I love!!  Okay, now for our meals...  I ordered the classic burger medium rare, but I thought was a little over cooked. It was still good though. I checked in with Yelp so I received complimentary vinegar fries, and omg they are so good! We also ordered a side of mac and cheese it was excellent! I also had a bite of the salted caramel butter cake & it's bomb!! Served in a cute little casserole dish with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. So good!!  Oh I also had a cocktail which I loved it was a fig fashioned. They serve it with a ice sphere perfect to cool you off in this weather   Our server was amazing! She made sure our drinks were always filled. Super sweet!  It was my first time in I'm not sure why no one had told me about this place before.",

Our server was super friendly, attentive and spaced out the meal perfectly.  The food was really good, sort of elevated bar food.  We only had burgers so we can't comment on the steaks.  Nice cocktails too.    The only thing holding them back from 5 stars is that it was super loud in there (they had a DJ) and as we were leaving the \"scene\" was getting a little douchey.  They have a great menu, well-trained staff and good food; I just wish they'd tone it down a little.  Still a great spot and could be a nice place to start a fun night out.",

We weren't impressed by the quality of the beef, or the cook. His was medium (ordered medium rare) and both didn't have the grill we expected. It was clear the patties were cooked on a flat top and then domed cooked (the edges were gray), not grilled to achieve a good char, yummy crust and juicy moistness. The beef itself lacked that beefy flavor I expect from a quality burger.   The onion rings were on point and the fries good (though they could have been cooked a little more to achieve a more golden, crispy exterior).",

    "text": "I'll start with the easy part...the food was outstanding!  The pork chop was cooked throughly which I must say was at first a bit of a concern when I was asked what temperature I preferred.  Maybe it's just me, but when it comes to a chop I better not see any pink inside.  It turned out delicious.   The first order of salt and vinegar fries were room temperature but they were promptly replaced with a delicious fresh basket that we quickly consumed so yummy!   Not a concern to me at all I just like piping hot fries.  (Did I say the fries were terrific? Yes!)  The Fig old fashion cocktail was creative with the presentation having the fig infused into the slowly melting ice ball! I need to try this at home!   My only \"ding\" is with server who brought our food.  It was not our original server (Madison was very engaging and great!).  We didn't have silverware and after the plates were set down by the other person, I asked for some.  They left us and rather than proceed to quickly retrieve the utensils, they were at a computer doing something else.  I had to walk over and another!   Now it might seem like a small detail to some,  but the vibe and ambiance of a place can hinge on the attention to the details.  Like the fig in the ice ball!  A fun way to engage guests in conversation and it adds to overall \"wow\" factor.  Having to seek out silverware while your food goes briefly untouched is a disappointment.    That same person then brought our second drinks and didn't mumble a word about anything.  A \"enjoy\" or \"here you go\" or \"can I get anything else now?\" Would have been polite. Probably upset that i said something, but I think with so much great food in the area, service can be the difference and management needs to know.  I'm looking forward to more great things to eat, more fun drinks to try, and maybe...just maybe...a little bit more attention to customer requests.  But again, 5 stars to Madison our delightful server for her attention to our details! And food we had was very delicious.  Made a return visit on Saturday 3/9 and the food was once again terrific.  I had the ribeye which was flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Our waitresses was extremely attentive to our every need.  They had a DJ playing tunes which created a nice vibe.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun evening in the Scottsdale Waterfront area.",

Had to retrieve our own silverware from the kitchen after asking several times. Received our sides several minutes after our entree. The brussels sprouts were hard and cold, the baked potato never came until after dinner. We asked for the manager several times: completely ignored our request. After he approached our table: many excuses why our food came out late, came out cold, not enough servers, etc. etc etc. He was apologetic but not accommodating. Finally, he did return with several discounts on our meal and apologies. Sadly, our experience was very negative.",

That said, I wasn't super impressed with what I ordered, and wished I had ordered something else.  I got the Crispy Chicken sandwich, and specifically wasn't a huge fan of the fried tempura.  I was hoping there would be some sort of light and crunchy breading instead of fried batter.  It kind of weighed down the sandwich.  Also, the sandwich tasted fine, but the chicken was a bit dry.  If I go back to Hand Cut, I'd order a burger or a steak next time.  I did try the Salt & Vinegar fries though, and really enjoyed those!  They came with ranch dressing on the side, and that complimented the fries nicely.",

    "text": "My friend and I stumbled upon this place and went for dinner after seeing the great reviews. Plus they offer free salt and vinegar fries with a yelp check-in. Yaaas! Salt and vinegar chips are my favorite, they may make my mouth feel like sand paper but they are so addicting I can't get enough! But I digress..   The night we came here, it was busy so obviously we had to wait. We couldn't even sit at the bar so we had to stand awkwardly in the way. The drinks were tasty. There was a lot to choose from and the combinations in the cocktail were pretty genius. Pricey for the amount you got, but it's a trendy Scottsdale restaurant.   We waited FOR.EVER. Which is why one star is knocked off. There were several staff just hanging out and chatting while one person was cleaning and turning over tables. I was so hungry I wanted to clean a table myself so we could be seated.  On to the food. The salt and vinegar fries were everything I dreamed they would be. Perfection! We also got the bacon mac and cheese and the creamed corn. First of all, bacon mac and cheese is LIFE but it could've been more cheesy and the breadcrumbs were a little too crispy, almost stale. And there wasn't enough bacon. The creamed corn was probably my favorite thing we got. I'm not the biggest fan of corn but I wanted to take a bath in this dish it was so amazing. Marry it and have its babies. If you ever come here, ORDER IT. We also shared the 8oz filet. I wanted it cooked medium rare and my friend wanted medium so they actually cut it in half and we got our own mini which was nice. We added on the garlic butter mushrooms but they put them in a dish on the side which was weird. Like I wanted them added onto the steak, which I thought was implied with the term \"add-on\". But whatever.   All in all, the food was fabulous. The service was not. We waited so long for everything. It seemed like we had a few servers not just one. Maybe her section was overly busy? I didn't get a drink I ordered and she didn't even apologize just said, \"oh I forgot to put it in\" and walked away. I would recommend this place and come back again in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the service. That would be my only hesitation because I get HANGRY. So you should definitely go to this place, just not when you're starving. And be prepared to wait.",

Food was off the charts - Venison loin chops medium rare we're unreal, and the butter cake was as good as Maestros.  Price?  Here it goes - Tuesday is half off bottle of wine and all Cuts (seafood and chicken too).  We had: a bottle of very nice Cab, artichoke dip app which was incredible and different, a chopped salad (fresh and amazing), venison loin chops (yep, you read it right), sauteed mushrooms and the butter cake.  Walked out stuffed for a total of $71!  You cannot get this food, wine and service for that price anywhere.",

We had made reservations for dinner which when arrived, had a table that was super low to the ground and was set up to enjoy cocktails and chit chat, not totally suitable for dinner. It was also set up next to a birthday party was gathering which my brother in law kept getting  hit in the face by purses and butts, awkward. And we didn't want to be rude either to interrupt the festivities.   My dad had ordered the venison - which he was super excited about - and when came out was cold unfortunately twice. My mom ordered a veggie burger that was crumbling by each attempt to bite. Will say their mushroom burger and pulled pork was delicious and on point.   Their service was really great and cocktails were amazing!",

That wasn't logical for that place hence why they changed it and made it way better. Now you sit down and order. I love the burgers there. They're so light and delicious. They have added a lot more items on the menu which I was really thrilled about. I got the California burger and fries. DELICIOUS. It just melt in your mouth. There desserts there are amazing too. You must go if you haven't. You won't be let down!",

Disco music is not what I want to dine to ... repetitive beat, constant thumping, no recognizable music, and LOUD - I had a hard time hearing my partner at the bar.

Our side order of fries came before the burgers and were very overdone. The burgers were ok. There was so much oil on the buns I couldn't even eat it. There seems to be a million people working here and no one could refill my water without me asking. It seemed like the staff was way more interested in flirting with each other than actually doing their jobs. Our waitress did take off the appetizers, which was nice, but we will definitely not be back.",

We got lucky and had some prime outdoor seats (The green chairs look padded, but are clearly not). Ashley was quite a nice waitress and we proceeded to cash in on my free app.coupon with the $10 new Spinach dip. A more upscale version served with toast points and the dip itself shined with a garlicky taste and a big surprise of raisins...yep secret ingredient perhaps?     Our burgers ($9 and $11) were cooked well, mine was actually crisp on the edges. Just had the classic, but the bun was squishy soft and it reminded me of an upscale Big Mac with the sauce they use. Not a fried egg fan, but the mushroom cheddar burger with egg got good reviews. Also, they have half orders of onion rings at $3 (not on the menu), but those panko crusted rings are worth an order. Good addition to the area.",

That is a pretty bold statement from me considering my grandparents own a beef ranch and I've never had a restaurant or \"store bought\" patty come within a fraction of the ones we make at home. I had the blue cheese burger. Wow!! The most juicy, flavorful patty (slightly misshapen you could tell it had just been ground and gently formed into patty shape and not over handled). Great choice on buns because they are good but not really noticed since it's what's inside that is the star (not too bready, not dry, just good). The toppings omg mmm. Perfectly cooked. I need another now!   My only regret was ordering the sides. The mac and cheese is rather plain and the sauce kind of thick/goopy and bland. Brussels and sweet potato, again very plain. Neither were bad though we ate it all. The salt and vinegar fries could rally be spectacular if they quadrupled the amount of salt vinegar seasoning! I wish they had a shake menu.   Next time going for just the burger. Would have been 4stars but the burger is so over the top good I have to give them all 5!",

Our server started out by telling us everything she likes on the menu and when asked if they could make a simple alteration to dish for allergy reasons, she was quite put off.  Ordered a side salad because it said it was only baby greens and vinaigrette but then came with corn, blueberries and cucumbers, two of which I am very allergic to. It's so important to include all ingredients so people aren't served something they aren't aware of and allergic to. My husband had a bib lettuce wrap the lettuce was dirty still. We won't be back and I think the others around us felt the same way. It's too bad because Phoenix has a lot of stiff competition and it's not easy competing with the other fantastic spots in the area. They have a good concept, but are missing the mark.",

We came in to get a table, but since it was full we sat at the bar. Nate was very knowledgeable on the menu and was suggestive as well. He suggested appetizers, went through the seasonal items, and answered any questions we had.  I ordered the Gardener, which is a cocktail made with Basil Hayden, berry preserves, and crushed ice. The cocktail was executed extremely well with a good balance of the bourbon with sweetness yet remained very light.   The two of us shared the pork and the salmon, with a side of the asparagus... both AMAZING and wished we could order it all over again.   I would recommend Hand Cut to everyone with the experience I had last night!",

It was medium rare. The mac N cheese was plain and tasted like it was out of a box. Fries... meh... eatable but not notorious. There was some kind of particle chunk poured into my water.

It also had pickled onions, lettuce, and tartar sauce, the bun was good.  5 - The Zucchini Fries were excellent. The dipping sauce was excellent. I would order again and again.   3 - The Cauliflower Gratin was ok. It was lukewarm but it had cheese so..... it was fine.   3.8 The Atmosphere was very bar like, with TVs indoors and outdoors. It reminded me of a mix between Hopdoddy and RnR, add in some unique and eclectic Alice in Wonderland style decor. I think I spotted one restoration hardware chandelier that, while beautiful, clashed a bit with the lacquer faux animal heads and white street lamps.  Overall score - 3.825 (I'll round up to 4 since they just opened)  I would try them again, this was their opening night and I am betting as they mature it will be better. I would say since it's more of a Chop House, I plan on trying a burger or piece of meat next time.   Service was great, friendly staff, they are still learning their menu and some items were not in stock yet. Meh.",

    "text": "I really hope to come back and update, but they have some major customer service flubs to overcome. Right off the bat, the hostess was very flustered. She was definitely giving off some serious anxious vibes.   Our waitress was very nice and attentive, but she was definitely spread way too thin. She had tables all over the entire restaurant and I think was pretty stressed about it. Regardless, she was on top of it with getting our orders and refilling drinks, etc. This always really annoys me, as I think it's a huge management flaw - i.e. they are too cheap to have enough staff working at once. It's a Thursday in Old Town in the Spring, you gotta anticipate a lot of people coming in.   The main issue was how SLOW the kitchen was. It was decently busy - definitely nothing crazy though. We were sat about 7:15 (Thurs night) and it was probably a little over half-full inside. We ordered the artichoke dip app and it took quite a while to get it. The worst, though, was that it took over an HOUR to get two burgers. They were just normal, right off the menu, burgers with no special modifications. My friend and I were getting pretty hangry. It was nearing 9 PM and our casual, quick bite was turning into a looooong dinner (with no food). Finally, my friend stopped who I think was the manager and asked her if our food was coming soon. She was super nice and quickly came back with our food. She was apologetic about it and even comped part of our bill.   The food itself was really yummy. I got the mushroom burger with an egg, and it was cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor.   Since the food is so delicious, the ambiance is cute, and the location is great, I would probably come back and give it another try. I hope they speed up the kitchen ASAP and properly staff up!",

Our waitress was knowledgeable and helped us choose what to order. I cant remember which cocktail I got but it was perfect - not too strong. For appetizer we got the salt and vinegar fries (a favorite) and spinach dip. Would definitely order the fries again, but probably not the spinach dip. Originally, the fries didn't sound like something I would normally order but our waitress talked us into it and they were awesome! For dinner, I got the crispy chicken sandwich and my fiance got the blue cheese burger. Both were fantastic and very generous sizes. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "It takes a lot for me to rate a place as one star. This joint qualifies.  This was my second visit here and the experiences quite similar.  Both times (~ 6pm for dinner) it took 40 minutes for the food to arrive.  This last visit a few days ago, not only did the food arrive late as usual, but 3 out of 3 \"medium rare\" grass fed burger patties were visibly burnt on both sides and very dry overall. I'd say they were cooked Well++.  2 of the burger buns were crushed. The manager and server seemed surprised that it would arrive so crushed, but that was a fake response. I know why, I just didn't tell them I saw what happened - one of the lamps they use to keep your food warm while they figure out their mess in the kitchen fell on the burgers and left a dent along the outer line of the lamp base.  We also ordered chicken wings. They were also very dry and sat there for a long time before delivered to our table.  We were short on time and opted to just stay and nibble at this food. The kids did not finish their meals.  The manager was sympathetic and took 15% off the bill. Any manager that knows what they're doing would have immediately comp'd the entire meal. This was crappy food that should have NEVER left the kitchen on its way to a patron. Who knows what else they mess up that we can't immediately tell visually.  This place can not be trusted. This place is hyped up but does not live up to it, not even close.",

When it was delivered to us it was over cooked. We sent it back and the cook said it was mid rare. It was hardly pink. They refused to make a new one.   The overall wait time for the food was 45min. There were several open tables so it wasn't that busy. Several times I saw the cook in the back text messaging on his phone.  My soda was empty during most of my meal. The waitress never came back to check on us, we had to have a runner help us.  This place is in a great location, has a cool vibe...yet...will soon be out of business if customers get the service we did.  I won't be going back.  --------------------------------- So I went back...and really happy I did. Tuesday's 1/2 price cuts are a great deal. Don't miss out",

Seared to perfection on the outside and a beautiful medium rare on the inside juicy good!  The deconstructed wedge salad had me worried but the creamy blue cheese, tart apples and meaty bacon were classic wedge wowza!

    "text": "Whoa! A first for me! 2x at the same restaurant in 91.5 hours (won't make it a habit due to a 26 mile drive across Phoenix). :o  I started with a Blackberry Mojito and Tempura Zucchini Fries (yummy).  However, I was a bit disappointed for a bit, as I went here for the Fillet Mignon. But, was given a lunch menu. Luckily, when I asked my waitress if I could order off the dinner menu, she said no problem. :)  So, I ordered that, medium rare, of course, with garlic mushrooms and grilled asparagus.  The meal was superb. Everything arrived hot. The fillet practically melted in my mouth.   The service wasn't quite at the level that I had on the first visit. But, it was still great service.  I'll be back. I just wish I lived closer to them.",

I was actually walking away from the restaurant after eating and thinking \"wow that was gross\".  Jalisco Valley Bramble ($8 HH) - Tequila and blackberry liqueur, with mint and lemon. This was really great, it was a little sweet but had nice flavor. 4/5  Mushroom Cheddar Burger ($10) - I absolutely love mushroom burgers and if I ever see one on a menu, that's what I'll order. Nothing beats a juicy burger with piles of mushrooms on it and that awesome mushroom flavor. Well this mushroom burger was TERRIBLE. They should rename it the \"Balsamic Vinegar Burger\" - because that is literally all I could taste. I was actually amazed at how I couldn't even taste any mushroom flavor given the amount of mushrooms on the burger. The menu states this burger is \"drizzled with balsamic\". Perhaps they should re-evaluate this statement. 0/5  Western Bacon Burger ($10) - The husband got this one and he liked it.  Sweet Potato Fries ($7) - This is another one of those unfortunate menu miscommunications. The menu states that the sweet potato fries are \"served with chili-lime aioli\". I wasn't sure if I'd like the dip but I knew that if I didn't, I could just eat the fries by themselves. I mean, how hard is it to f up sweet potato fries? When the waitress brought over this basket of fries, the smell was so overwhelming that I actually wanted to gag. The fries were absolutely completely COVERED in spices. I tentatively tried one and all I could taste was paprika. Tons and tons of paprika. It was absolutely disgusting. I tried them with the dip and that tasted even worse. I cannot believe that they wouldn't state on the menu that the fries are covered in this spice mix. 0/5",

My only issue is that i noticed everyone (employees) wearing a different pattern/colors in the restaurant so it's almost like you don't know who works there. I feel like they need to all kind of have the same colors on. Like the guy cutting vegetables was wearing a diamondbacks shirt... someone else in grey.. someone else wearing multi colored shirt... then someone wearing sweatpants I'm like dang so who actually works there? Lol.  But overall food was great....and our waitress was friendly. That's really what matters. But i would like to know who actually works there so they should figure out a color scheme for the staff.",

Not a meat person but I do  like steak tartar.  Nate are bartender amazing patient supper busy but was still accommodating. Nice vibe in Scottsdale out of the zone but I'd come back. Had burrata amazing with yellow beets even better. Also house made smoked salmon. Because apple took 3 hrs  I had the benefit to transition from lunch to dinner. Steak tartar different they cook the egg u will want to make sure u clarify  runny cause even though the redid it still yolks over cooked. Its different won't order it again but not what I expected. A whole cooked egg on top of tartar.  Honestly not the best I've had. They should clarify Its a whole cooked egg on top of tartar.  They said raw egg not egg sunny side up. But otherwise what I had was good. I like the venue and people but tartar made them loose a star. Great place to go to ...just clarify what your ordering.",

My wife has Celiac disease so I'm always very, very careful to talk to a manager before we choose a restaurant.  When the manager and/or the wait staff use the phrase \"a dedicated fryer\" that's my benchmark for knowing what a gluten allergy is!!  I got the Rib Eye ( no surprise ) and my wife got the chicken. Mushrooms, grilled asparagus and a baked potato rounded out the dinner. The food was absolutely perfect. Medium rare on my steak and mushrooms were the perfect side. Small complaint. A touch too much salt. But truly, this is just my personal taste on food. I always under salt figuring that you can always ADD salt but can't take it away.  Parking is convenient. There's s great underground lot right next door. And the location we went too is on the Scottsdale Waterfront District and very beautiful. We actually parked across the canal and walked over just to enjoy the view. As far as chop houses go, I rant Hand Cut above average! Go give this place a try.  To Janessa, our waitress, thank you for being attentive and knowledgeable.",

Anyway, the wife and I came on a Saturday evening and I ordered the Western Bacon burger and my wife ordered the Crispy Chicken sandwich. My burger was unimpressive... I mean I can get a better burger at The Habit (fast food) and for a lot less! My wife's Crispy Chicken was crispy alright, over-cooked crispy. If you like chicken jerky, you'll love this sandwich but if not, then you'd be disappointed as my wife was.   She also had The Matador signature cocktail which was good but weak on the alcohol. I had a Fresh Squeezed IPA which was good but pour was small (maybe 12 oz) and whoever poured needs to learn how to pour IPAs as it had a big head on it which resulted in 1/4 loss of actual beer. That's very important for beer lovers as myself.  Now, something they should fix - 2 single bathrooms right next to open kitchen. First of all, how can you have so little bathroom space for a place that is selling so many alcoholic drinks? And secondly, right next to an open kitchen? I was waiting in line for vacant bathroom 3 feet away from food that was being prepared. That's gross!  Finally, the place seems to be a draw for Millennials. Nothing wrong with that but if you are in your 50's as me and the wife are, you may not enjoy dining with a room full of mostly noisy Millennial guys. Just sayin. :-)  So, tried it, didn't like it and won't be back. Hope you guys make some improvements as the location (Scottsdale Waterfront) is great.",

I alerted my waitress of an allergy to dairy (not preference- allergy) when we got there, and again when I ordered. When I received my food, it was fortunate that my sister noticed it looked like they had put cheese on my burger. I opened up the bun, and sure enough, there were remnants of pieces of cheese like they had put cheese on and scraped it off at the last minute. This is not just unacceptable, but dangerous. Hiding the fact that an allergen had been placed in my food and then serving it anyway is incredibly irresponsible. We alerted the staff, and they remade my food and comped our bill... so at least they knew a big mistake had been made. Out of sheer fear of it happening again, however, I will not be eating here again.",

I then am approached by a sommelier with a bad attitude who tells me \"those are just for display.\" Really it's a $25 bottle of bourbon, it should be for sale. So stupid and unaccommodating.   2. Filet was over cooked. Ordered medium and it came out well done.   3. One men's and one women's single bathroom for the entire restaurant and bar. There was a line outside of both bathrooms and when I asked if there was any more bathrooms, I was told no because this building was previously a clothing store and bathrooms were not needed. Well guess what you started a restaurant in old town and you have two single facilities for the entire place. Big time fail!  Lastly I was ill all night suspiciously from the food.

I would recommend Hand Cut to family and friends!",

The Zucchini fries and truffled mash potatoes are out of this world! Their house Cab- Drumheller is unreal, I started with one glass and we ended up ordering a bottle for the table! Great service you can't go wrong!",

We got here at 1:30 to eat lunch before our 3:00 appointment, but got 3 plates of incorrect food (we have food allergies) at 2:45. It is not busy in here. There is no excuse for this. I will never eat here again.  Edit: the staff did comp our meal, and I had an email exchange with someone in response to this review (assuming owner or manager?). The staff did do their best to handle the situation after it had happened, and the owner/ manager did have genuine interest in making the situation better.",

Also, I've had exactly every appetizer on the menu and nothing is worth having again. I find myself at this place more than I'd like because the cocktails are excellent and the vibes are just so trendy.  PS do not try the steak tar tar it's probably the worst thing I've ever had and I've had it at a couple other places so I know what it can taste like and well no just don't.",

We all had burgers of one form or another. I had mushroom cheddar, wife had classic, the the two others in our party had the jalapeno burger. We all had dill and vinegar fries. Everything was excellent. Juicy burgers with lots of toppings and fries were very tasty.   Good food, good service and good prices. Definitely will return.",

Everything was excellent!  Burger was outstanding, vinegar & sea salt fries and onion rings were just the right portions for us.   Excellent service from the staff, even though it was during the mid-afternoon lull at 3:00 pm. We'll definitely be back to try the steak menu.

Wines by the bottle are also half price! I was looking for somewhere new and fun to celebrate my son's 15th birthday, so I contacted the GM who was very helpful and we went last night for dinner.  This restaurant is located at the very trendy Waterfront at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Whoever did the interior design did a fantastic job...kind of Kelly Wearstler meets Philippe Starck for the design mavens out there . It definitely appealed to the designer in me.  Our server, Sarah was just fantastic! She was so sweet and knowledgeable . She recommended a great red blend called Motto Gung Ho, and I was able to order the bottle at $14.  I ordered the filet MR+ and added blue cheese crumbles. It was one of the most tender cuts I've had,  and perfectly prepared! Dishes are served a la  carte, and I ordered roasted cauliflower in a Parmesan cream sauce to accompany my steak.  My son had the roast chicken breast with the macaroni carbonara, and he was not disappointed! We had dessert too...a homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich and the butter cake  with salted Carmel and roasted peaches. So yummy! We had another great server, Kylie, who opened the wine and let us know about the burger and drink special for $10 each weekday until 3:00.  I will definitely be returning to try out the burgers, which are all grass fed beef btw.",

I cant because we never had a server come to our table.  When we arrived we were told it was a 2 hour wait. From the host stand we could see the restaurant was half full at best. We were deciding where else we could go and a different host approached us and said she could clean a table for us and seat us immediately  We were sat... and we literally sat for 23 minutes without being greeted by a server. Looking around there were at least 6 tables that also had no service. One person in our party used the men's restroom and said there were no towels or dryer for his hands. Instead there was a roll of toilet paper sitting next to the sink. He used that to dry his hands. Before we left I asked a host to speak with a manager her answer \" she is here somewhere but we can never find her\". You lost a $400 table last night and could not find a manager to try to correct the issues",

Earlier in the month some friends said they had heard good things about this place and we walked in on a week night. It was easy to find, great modern decor and was a very clean and nice looking restaurant.   The hostess up front was nice and got us sat right away.   Here's where they lost me. It just took so long to get everything out and our server was visibly frustrated which I understand but at the same time it's probably not best to show that to the customer. We ordered appetizer's and got some wings and the salmon while my two friends got some drinks. The drinks came out really quick. The food did not.   Then on to entree's. Mind you they came out around 35-40 mins after our appetizers came out. About 20 minutes into the wait for the entrees it felt like our server would actively avoid us, walk past the table very quickly and not make eye contact. We were very calm but it was incredibly apparent that some of their other tables were very difficult to deal with. Two of us got steaks and the other got a sandwich. Some form of short rib sandwich. The steaks were cooked very unevenly. One side was rare and the other was well done. It was very strange.   The rib sandwich though was good apparently according to my friend. So there's that.  Either way. Rough night all around. Once the bill came we just dropped the cash on the table and ran. Can't see this place making itself into the rotation.",

Was greeted by the server and we told her it was our first time.  She gave some suggestions which is always appreciated.  All went down from here....  Started with the tempura zucchini.  This was good!! Crisp outside and tender inside.  This was the only thing worth eating...here is the rest.....  I got the western burger, hubby the mushroom cheddar and my nephew the chop classic burger -- all cold with sale buns!  We got the creamer corn...cold, good flavor but could have been way better if hot and creamy as the menu states.  Salt and vinegar fries were sent back...cold.  Bacon Mac and cheese...cold.  Ok let me explain why so frustrating -- it is a Monday night.  There are 4 other tables and some peeps at the bar all here before us.    Service was pitiful.  There were at least 2-3 servers for 4 tables.  Our server was annoyed with us and flat out rude.  Everything we asked was bothersome to her.  Drinks were empty most of meal, but she had a good chat session with a friend at the bar.  She was there every second she could be -- not a good thing to see when ur drink is empty.  She cleared all out plates and still took 20+ minutes to bring the bill.   I wish it was a better review/experience, great location.  Overall Impression -- pass.  Too many other great restaurants to settle for cold food.",

I had the chance to meet one of my favorite people for a quick dinner and drinks and we settled on Hand Cut. Love the location and the atmosphere. The patios feel like outdoor living rooms and the vibe is elevated but relaxed.   My girl ordered a regular burger and the sweet potato French fries and I ordered the loaded baked potato with chopped steak.   The food was eh. Mine was so unbelievably dry- even with butter and sour cream and bbq sauce. Even more butter and still- this just wasn't working. Like the Sahara of baked potatoes. Less than one star.   My drink tho. Friends. Friends, do yourself a favor and immediately only order black berry mojitos here for the rest of your life. It was like an adult beverage snowcone of happiness. Made me way less irritated about the potato. 5 stars for blackberry satisfaction in a glass.",

Zucchini fries were decent but left a pile of grease on the plate.  Maybe a smaller cut and less batter would suffice.  Also had the smoked salmon which had a great mix of toppings but the bread was so thick it ate like a sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, the bread was fantastic and could stand on it's own but together was a little much.

We were served promptly with extremely friendly service by Emily and Nicole!   They were able to keep food and drinks moving for a full bar.  We had a burger and a  short rib dip which were both perfectly cooked.  Happy hour on a Saturday was a huge plus.  The only slight downside is that they have a huge collection of whiskeys that they won't sell to patrons- we were told they were for decoration only.",

It makes such an uncomfortable vibe when entering and leaving when the hostess isn't friendly.  However, our waitress was great. Sweet and bubbly. She took our orders quickly which I loved! I got the black bean burger which was delicious! The buns fluffy and soft, the black bean patty was fresh and so flavorful! I loved the sauce and also the avocado and cheese was a nice touch!  When you check in on yelp they give you a free basket of fries and those were delicious as well! We will come back the next time we visit AZ.",

I thought ok that's rude, but since I had family in I kept to myself. The manager I think then approached us to seat us a few minutes later but then I realized my greeter was my WAITRESS too! She is a kind girl but we did not have good service, she would go missing to do other task for the restaurant as I don't think this is even her job title. The food was ok but my daughters chicken sandwich was chewy, mine wasn't even made how I wanted it and when I tried to explain, but she didn't even seem to comprehend what I was saying so , I said forget it.   Overall I was there for family time, but this isn't someplace that has me wanting to come back with service like that. Oh",

To make things much worse, the kitchen literally took 45 minutes to get our entrees out. The waitress was great, but unfortunately she couldn't make up for how slow the kitchen was. Definitely a bummer about the food because there was a cool vibe with a live DJ in the restaurant.",

Our table really enjoyed the local beer selection, although due to great choices no one winner was declared.  We were seated in a large elevated booth (6 of us) towards the kitchen so we could watch the grilling. Just one change would have made the difference and one more star and that is lowering the music just a tad. This would enable our server and us not to have to repeat so often. For this visit, a miscommunication resulting in the barely eaten fries and sweet potato fries to be tossed versus boxed so the table was cleared for dessert. I was so looking forward to noshing these as a midnite snack.",

The lunch menu is simple and sweet which is great when you're limited on time. I ordered the kale salad and omg it was delish! Such a great size, plenty of chicken and it wasn't drowning in dressing. The cauliflower also added an extra healthy crunch which I was happy about. My coworkers ordered the bbq burger and a grilled chicken burger and they both finished everything! I heard that the sweet potato fries are some of the best!!! My friend also mentioned that the dinner menu is great and has a lot of great variety so I am anxious to go back for dinner.  The atmosphere is what really had me the second we walked in! Such a great decor vibe all throughout with cool things to constantly look at and the space felt open, clean, fun, and welcoming! I could totally see myself back here with a group for brunch or drinks. The bar was huge and had a wide variety to choose from which is always a major plus! Overall I am soo excited about this place, our server was so sweet and attentive and the food a plus! I really can't wait to go back!",

The service is always pretty good which in Scottsdale that's sometimes hard to find.  I went to dinner there last night and we ordered the beets and burrata as an app and it was amazing.  About 45 minutes after we ordered our burgers came out (it did take a long time but the company was good so I didn't mind).  I ordered my grass fed burger medium and it came out extra well done and after waiting so long I didn't want to send it back.  I really wanted to love the burgers there but unfortunately I did not get what I ordered.  I'm not sure at this point if I would risk ordering a burger here again.  Just to reiterate though- the service was VERY good :)",

First off, it was Black Friday, and here this restaurant is right across the street from a crazy busy mall and they don't have enough staff on hand.    We had a reservation so when we arrived a couple minutes early we were told that we would have to wait because they were running way behind because they didn't have enough staff on hand to seat us.  They did warn us that the kitchen was way backed up even though at the time we arrived it was not very crowded.  The best part of her meal with the fries that were season great and had fresh dill on them   Priscilla was our waitress and she did the best that she could do considering the lack of staff. Short rib dip, Was by far our favorite, crispy chicken sandwich was boring. Salt and vinegar dill french fries rocks! Grass fed beef ranch burger with jalapeno was not spicy and had no jalapeno flavor to it at all! Bulleit Mule was god, It's hard to mess that up!  With so many choices a fantastic restaurants I WOULD NOT bother going back.",

There were some hits and misses: the hits - 1) western bbq burger was delicious and big enough to share if you don't have a big appetite 2) salt and vinegar fries were good. I would skip the spinach artichoke dip and the onion rings. I wasn't a fan. The yelp check in offer was a free large size of salt and vinegar fries and they gave a complimentary dessert for the birthday celebrant. The cookie dough bread pudding was good but very chocolatey. Overall, our bill was on the cheap side for our party so we gave a good generous tip. The restaurant has an awesome and trendy atmosphere so you should come down and visit!",

Appetizers: Wings: They were a little strange in flavor having tasting much of a sweet basil. I was not too happy about the flavor as they were very different from what I was expecting and an unusual flavor.  Spinach/Artichoke Dip: This is the best thing they have on the menu. The dip was creamy and the artichokes were caramelized almost having a garlic/onion flavor. Everyone was clamoring for more!  Zucchini: Pretty good, but if you don't like spice, please do not get them. They were a little more spicy than I would have liked.  Dinner: Flank Steak: Do not get the steak. We all had it and, while I know flank steak can be a tougher cut of meat, if cooked properly, it is not tough. They cut they meat with the grain which made it even tougher,  Sides: we had the asparagus, mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts all of which were pretty ordinary. They were trying to make them better by putting a ton of butter on all of them, but it did not help.  All-in-all, the service was fabulous! The servers know what they are doing. However, the only thing I tried that I absolutely loved was the dip.  Parking: Do not make a left at the restaurant or you will do some walking. Instead park in the parking garage on the right (west). The restaurant is almost right across the street.   I took some pictures of the restaurant since the locations looks pretty cool inside!",

We got the food from the delivery service. Since we lived not far from the restaurant, the food were still hot like just got out of the kitchen.  Mushroom cheddar burger is perfectly cooked. The medium beef patty is so delicious and I cannot stop enjoying it. Jalapeno ranch burger is also good with the same deliciously medium cooked beef. The large portion of salt & vinegar fries is also fresh and tasty.  We also ordered the dessert that come with ice cream. We were wondering at first on how they did pack them. When we got the order, we were so happy that they separate warm molten chocolate cherry cake from a scoop of ice cream. We did not have to deal with the melted ice cream. When we are ready to have a dessert, we just put the scoop of ice cream on top. Then boom! the warm cake meets the cold ice cream. They are so delicious and compliment each other.  Now this place is on our place to visit and dine in.",

The salt & vinegar fries were too salty and could have used malt vinegar on the side instead of however they use the vinegar.  They are covered with an herb that tasted like dill-proving French fries will go with just about anything.  Just about.

There was also an option to upgrade your meat to a grass-fed, organic version for about $2 (at least for the burger, anyway). The ambience was nice but definitely more of a bar scene since the restaurant is kind of centered around the bar that sits in the center of the place.  The kitchen prep area is enclosed in glass so you can watch some food prep while you wait. Definitely recommend giving this place a try.",

I ended up ordering the tequila bramble, which was delicious. Matt himself went above and beyond to make sure my drink was made properly, and went out of his way to get me a drink that was so refreshing with the mint and blackberry liqueur. It was the perfect cocktail and I have Matt to thank for that! I also had the California burger which was cooked perfectly and the salt and vinegar fries were yummy as well.  The bar staff and everyone there was so great and helpful. Thank you to Matt and everyone for making it such a great evening.

That said I experienced some challenges tonight and my review centers on what went right vs. the less than ideal.   I took my family to eat, candidly because the place we wanted to eat claimed a 90 minute wait with no people in line and plenty of available tables (I digress), and we got seated with a good menu and the view of a TV for game. Unfortunately we ran into some issues but the measure of an individual and a company comes from challenge more than the norm.  When we experienced challenge Alexandra showed up and made everything right. She gets its, gets how to run a business, and gets how to ensure customers get taken care of with respect; not some hustle for an alterior motive. I can only say we would come back again just for her and, given a little tenure, I can promise she will run an establishment flawlessly.   Alexandra, we appreciate and admire what you do.

    "text": "I have to say for a great,  grass fed, Arizona local real Beef burger dont even think about going anywhere else,  Hand Cut is my go to burger joint. When you first arrive the whole restaruant just feels alive,  it's open yet still cozy,  the kitchen and prep areas are also very visible from the seating area. This is particularly nice so you can really get a vibe for the employees,  the care and character of the food and the presentation.   We had great suggestions from our waitress on what to get, starter was Tempura Zucchini Fries (excellent not over fried), Western Burger (medium) ,  onion rings (perfect crunch with a soft and meaty inside) , my buddy had the Lobster Roll Burger,  which she will post a separate review (super yummy).   As we were waiting for our food to arrive Justin one of the owners, came to our table and told us he just passed by the window of the kitchen and saw our food and it was looking amazing,  he then went back and brought us our dinners.   Wow is the only way I can explain the table presentation and the first bite,  local organic,  grass fed,  sustainable Arizona beef is nothing short of amazing. The flavor was out of this world and unlike any burger I have had anywhere in the valley,  the BBQ sauce was unique and homemade and the roll was dynamite. All in all it was perfection to the last bite.    The must try dessert is the Butter Cake,  it is way better than the version at City Hall,  perfectly moist,  and sweet with a scoop of premium  ice cream on top.   I'd like to also add the rest of the staff at Hand Cut Burgers were, attentive, considerate,  and caring,  keeping up with my iced tea drinking problem very nicely.   Hand Cut Burgers, has now become my Favorite Arizona burger destination. Please guys don't change a thing.",

I got the classic burger, which to be fair was generous in size, was pretty good but not going to change your life. The creamed corn was pretty good but came out at lukewarm and I wanted it to piping hot. The salt and vinegar fries only had a very subtle vinegar taste like maybe the fries were made next to a vinegar bottle that forgot to tip into the fries. The inside decor is pretty good but the music is just a tad too loud so everyone is just kind of screaming at each other. It gives the feeling like you are in the club but somehow instead of my usual vodka sprite I had a big burger in one hand and a fries in the other. Overall good but not great.",

No sauce, lettuce, pickles...the things that normally go on the burger I ordered. I told the waitress, she brought all the goodies on a separate plate. I ordered medium, I received rare.  Second time, our appetizer took FOREVER & was basically a salad.  I thought I'll beat them at their own game & I'll order a gluten-free wrap (why won't they just serve GF buns!??) & order medium-well. I DID get all my goodies this time, but I got rare meat again.  I don't want to go again, try to order WELL & get rare again. So, I quit.   Bottom line, I make better burgers. I can make them with grass-fed beef for under $10 a piece, so I will.

We pretty much sampled the whole menu with our large group.. Salt and vinegar fries are AMAZING!!! The best start to our dinner. Followed by the creamy corn and Mac n cheese, both amazing as well. Steak was cooked to perfection and the cheeseburger (topped with bacon and onion rings) did NOT suck! Thank god for stretchy jeans because we finished the night off with an ice cream cookie sandwich.. Some of the best local ice cream, and the mint chocolate chip cookie is to die for! I will definitely be back very soon!",

I never do that, but I absolutely couldn't stomach it.  The server was very nice about it and even kept apologizing, even though it was my fault rather than hers.  Last, but definitely not least, the food was fantastic!!  We shared the carbonara and cauliflower apps.  The one complaint was that the servings were small for being \"to share\", but the flavors were great.  Then I had the classic burger--cooked to perfection, juicy, and a good bun.  And it was a perfect size, not of those giant burgers that you can't fit in your mouth.  My friends had 2 of the other burgers and loved them.  The fries were great too!  I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Met friends here based on recommendation from PBS. If you have party larger than 4/5, may be a cozy seating setup. We had party of 6. Menu explained by very attentive server who explained the grass fed beef concept. Not knowledgeable about seafood entree. I know better than to ask for fish in a chop house. But I really wanted a nice piece of salmon. Wrong restaurant. Chicken sandwich for companion was great. Steak and venison dishes were well prepared. Side dishes were generally good, but cauliflower was overlooked and fries were a little salty. Odd that although I ordered salad as part of meal, it came with entree and the half dozen sides ordered by the table. Server did not ask whether I wanted salad early or with entree. Very odd. Dessert included the buttercake that the servers raved about. Obviously never had homemade cake before.  Very average dinner. Big on Arizona grown beef locally sourced, but that is all that you can say about the place or the food.",

Out of 5 of us only 2 of us got the burger temperatures we ordered. Mine was inedible, but my kale salad was delicious. The salt and vinegar fries were yummy especially the dill aioli that accompanied them. The hand cut baked potato wasn't fully cooked and the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato side was full of sugar and also inedible. The glass of wine is listed as 6oz but the actually serving that was poured was no where near that. Service was ok- probably the better part of our experience however it didn't blow me away. Honestly we were all really excited to try this place out, but it's looking like it's another trendy joint that is focused solely on aesthetics and not that actual product it's serving. I hope it gets better, but won't be trying it out again anytime soon.",

They come the wonderful staff that created el hefe, whiskey row, and farm and craft in old town Scottsdale. I went to check it out on the week day, not a lot of people, middle of the day, staff was very friendly and attentive! When you walk in it's like your in a lounge but a cool lounge with vintage and colorful decor! I love it, it makes it what it is, which is cool, hip and can be enjoyed for all ages. Wide selection for their full bar, they even have a cool ice cream parlor for desserts. Lots of seating for inside, bar and even cool prop seating to the the Scottsdale fashion square mall, and people watching. Let's talk about the eats, I ordered the Jalapeno Ranch burger really superb, loved how it was spicy but not spicy where I needed water, it was a tasty spice! Which I really loved and I think they mastered. Everything is a la carte but I don't think you'll have a sad wallet After your meal. Everything is fairly affordable and you'll walk out the place a happy and satisfied customer. I also shared the sweet potato and Brussels sprouts, ugh delicious I love sweet potatoes and BS tho! Definitely wanna go for happy hour, it looks like they have such a wide and cool cocktail menu! Oh btw everything is made in house, and local produce way to go! Well Phoenix come through and eat a burger, stay hungry!",

    "text": "Let's start by saying that I wanted to love this place so much. I had such high hopes. We waited 1 hour for a table on a Friday evening around 7:30pm. We shopped around and came back around 8:30pm. After sitting down and ordering, we waited 40 more minutes for our meal (just basic burgers and fries). Finally, around 9pm, we got our food and started eating, and it was quite possibly the worst burger I've ever had. I ordered it medium well and it was rare. The burger was rock hard on the outside, and the meat was super stringy and overcooked (yet raw throughout the entire inside). I ordered the \"Californian\" burger that was supposed to come with avocado and sweet potato shoestrings, and they forgot all of my toppings. I asked the waiter for my toppings and he brought me a BROWN avocado slice and 1 tablespoon of sweet potato crumbs (no joke). I took 1 bite of my burger, doused in ketchup, and just couldn't even stomach the rest. The waitstaff was nice, but I just could not see myself paying $15 for a burger that literally way worse than I could ever get at a fast food restaurant.  Overall, we wont be back. Again, I'm so bummed that this place wasn't a win. I'm always looking for a new spot to grab a burger on the weekend, but this place definitely was not it. :(  Final heads up: The music is SUPER loud. There is a live DJ which is pretty cool, but the music wasn't conducive to a restaurant setting. I love a good scene, but I couldn't even talk to my boyfriend without shouting.",

Everyone seemed so hip....man I'm old!  I wanted to try their burgers so bad, but I didn't feel like eating a full one by myself and didn't want to take any home.  So I went with the Hanger Steak instead.  My family and I all shared their Salt & Vinegar Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Onion Rings, and Macaroni and Cheese.  Overall, I really enjoyed their creativity with the fries which also came along with dill and dill ranch dip.  My favorite bite was probably the onion rings which was extra crisp with a hard crunchy breading which helped contain the warm bite every time!  I didn't care much for the sweet potato fries since...it is what it is and the mac and cheese was supposed to come with lobster, but didn't get much of that at all; again love the creativity here!  My hanger steak was okay.  I wanted it medium rare, but only the middle cut was at the right temperature while the two tips were well done.  It came along with a creamy butter atop, but that only covered the middle section of my steak;  I was totally craving for that butter haha!  It really helped make the steak pop for me, but there only morsels of it!    In the end, I rather enjoyed my visit to this place, but I need to shoot for what I want next time I guess.  I heard their burgers were bomb so until next time! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have very mixed feelings about Hand Cut. It is right around the corner from my house so I love the convenience. The food is amazing, great steaks and phenomenal veal. My only trouble with Hand Cut is that the service I get there is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes they are sharp and quick and sometimes I'll get a server who doesn't know what a \"neat\" drink is and forget my table exists. Still haven't decided if this place is for me, let's see if they can pull it together and tighten up a bit!  UPDATE: Kevin has reached out to me and because of their amazing marketing and customer service, I'm confident that they will be taking care of me in the future and genuinely care about improving. (Hence the adjustment of my review). I will be eating here much more as time continues!",

Crispy chicken was very good, chicken melt was ok.  Both had more bread than chicken though.  Burger was ok.  Sweet potato fries were good, aioli was great.  Salt & vinegar fries are AMAZING.   Probably won't go back but might just for fries!  Thought it was a bit pricey since sides are a la carte.",

Scallops with apple bacon compote had muddy flavors that was unremarkable .  Finally my desert plating was a paper cup with a plastic spoon. The bright spot was server, Sofia.

    "text": "I'm not sure where to start.     When we booked our reservation on Open Table, it showed the option of indoor or outdoor seating.    What it didn't say ANYWHERE was that there are only 2 tables for 4 outside and 1 table for 2.   One of the tables for 4, is pretty much on the sidewalk.    Thankfully we didn't have to sit at that one.      Our waiter came over, brought us waters and took our drink order.    When he brought our drinks back we put in our order.   We didn't order any appetizers and he never even suggested any.     45 min later, we still didn't have our burgers or sides.    The manager only wanted to give us another round of drinks but drinking strong drinks on a very empty stomach......not a great idea.     She then brought out or sides about 3 or 4 min before our burgers.     The excuse - we had a lot of large parties tonight.    I understand things like that happen and you get backed up.   It would have been nice to be told that when we ordered....or even 30 min later.    After dinner we weren't even offered a dessert menu.    I did ask for one but the waiter came back with our check instead.    They comped our burgers and charged us for the drinks and sides which was the appropriate thing to do.    However, it would have been nice to see the dessert menu and not \"get kicked out\" as we felt that is what was happening.         As for the food, the onion rings were fabulous and so were the snap peas.   I ordered my burger medium and it was more  medium - well to well done.    Aside from all that, the inside of the restaurant looked lovely.    There were big tvs for sports as well as a DJ.    The atmosphere was nice.     For the that I give it 1 star and for the sides another star.",

I was actually really excited to eat here as it was a recommendation from a local and friend. Well, I think I pissed off the server because she was very tiny and I called her short. Like a wow you're really tiny way, as in I was surprised about her height and once we got got our food. We never saw her again. So maybe she is a heightest.   The wings were interesting. Flavorful but not to my taste. The atmosphere is also loud so don't try to have. Conversation. The tempura zucchini was average and lacked flavor. Wife got a burger. Average.

They have a lunch special, $10 for a burger, fries, and a drink and it was great. As I walked in the hostess greeted me and asked where I would like to sit. Since I was by myself I sat at the bar and just looked around. I was very impressed by the decor and the setup. The place is friendly with a good combination of hightops, booths, tables, and bar seats. It took me a minute to realize that not only does it have an open kitchen style where you can see the food being prepared, there is actually a glass wall next to the South row of booths where you can see the meat being prepared and cut... i.e. Hand Cut!  The bartender was very friendly and answered my questions about the items on the menu. I went with a bacon cheeseburger along with sweet potato fries and a soda. The wait for food was not long and when I got it, it was excellently cooked and delicious.  I will definitely be returning and highly recommend it if you're in the area and looking for a good burger. In fact I'd say it's better than Shake Shack and you get a better atmosphere at a much more reasonable price. Check it out!",

My my Hand Cut, aren't we off to a good start!   We were greeted by an enthusiastic server who's name started with a K. K. explained that all beef is grass fed and grass finished (no antibiotics or hormones) and they try to source everything at the local level. She knew the menu and was able to give suggestions with confidence.  Fantastic service!  We went with the following:  Salt & Vinegar Fries: they taste exactly how they sound, are garnished with fresh dill (love that), and served with a small side of house ranch...I could have used more ranch.  Macaroni Carbonara: the sunny side up egg on top makes this dish!    California Burger: How cute was this lil burg!  The portions are pretty small but at least there was some good flavor.  Highlights were the sprouts and pickled onions.  Mushroom Burger: this was the superior burger!!!  Add the egg.  It is totally worth it because Hand Cut's fried egg game is tight!  The mushrooms are roasted then drizzled with balsamic vinegar.  The arugula and roasted garlic mayo didn't hurt!  Last we were taken on a treat journey!  Chocolate Chip cookie with Salted Carmel Ice Cream: I am not sure how they pulled off intense salt flavor in their Salted Camel ice cream with out being offensively salty.  The salt flavor came first and was followed by sweet creaminess.  I would say it's some of the best salted caramel ice cream I have had.  The cookie was great too.  It was crunchy enough that it didn't fall apart but soft enough to stab with a spoon.  Overall, it was a great and entertaining meal!",

There is a complete lack of regard or consideration for anyone who is in a wheelchair. The majority of the seating is either high tables or booths that are right by the bar. How is someone in a wheelchair supposed to comfortably be seated at a booth with people sitting at the bar directly behind them moving their chairs? Wheelchair-accessible seating is not designated to booths in the first place; it should be a normal low table. The lower tables are outside, what a complete lack of regard for ALL customers. (not to mention I think there are only 2-3 regular tables outside). The majority of the seating should be low, with some high tables. I will not support a business that doesn't provide adequate seating to all customers.   Second, the waitresses are annoying. When I came here with my mom and my husband, the waitress kept calling my husband \"sweetie, honey\" etc. Sorry, but if I wanted to hear a waitress talk that way I would go to Hooters. It made him uncomfortable and it was completely uncalled for.  Third, the first and ONLY time I got a drink from the bar it came with a beautiful lip mark already on it.

My visit here over the weekend was very fun.  The decor and music is upscale, hip and trendy.  Kind of like a steakhouse meets a nightclub or lounge.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed the chopped salad, crispy baked chicken wings and the hand cut classic burger.  All were very good but I definietly want to come back and try their steaks.  The bartenders were very friendly and made great cocktails.  My Manhattan and my friend's Sazerac were excellent.",

From the moment we entered we were turned off at the noise level for being so early in the evening and how very young the staff appeared, however, loved the decor and open concept!  We were excited to try it but that excitement was grossly postponed as we waited....and waited.....and yes, waited for service!  When we finally did have a server come to our table and take drink orders, i think they were still distilling the alcohol; then the same once we finally got the servers attention to take our food order.  By this time we had been there almost an hour!!! On a positive note the burgers were fabulous; one of the best any of us had tasted.  For just a few minutes we were able to forget the very loud music and horrific service but that didn't last as we couldn't get her attention to get our bill.  We may go back for the burger and give it another try but during the day.  Maybe there's an adult monitoring the servers and maybe the music will be a more conducive level for day hours.  I'll have to think about this one......",

The food was so delicious. We got a variety of sides to split. The only thing that took away from it was the slower service.

Everything was hot and fresh. I also ordered the creamed corn which was probably my favorite item! It's rare places even offer creamed corn but absolutely worth it.    Lastly, Adam, one of the managers brought us over a peach cobbler and ice cream dessert that complemented our dinner perfectly. Adam spent extra time with our group to make sure our first time was a memorable one. I think I have found one of my new favorite places.  Big shout out to the staff and management.",

    "text": "I discovered Hand Cut from a fellow Wild Dining MeetUp member, who told me he was coming here to eat on upcoming Tues for half price off 'the Cuts\".  When I looked at the menu, I came on the same night in Aug, and saw him there.  He invited me to join him at his table.  Sara the Eurasian girl with long honey-colored hair, was our server.   She was so cute, adorable vivacious personality, and pretty, and came back to check on us at least 5 times!  We both ordered the venison chops, 2 for $11.  They were quite rare on the inside, but I like my red meat very red on inside.  The chops were so delicious.  We shared 2 half orders of onion rings $3, but the second order came out almost burnt and very very salty, like cook dumped the salt box in the coating.  By the time we had a couple of pieces there was really nothing to send back, so we didn't.    I give the service and venison chops 5 stars for my first visit!.  I was so impressed that I posted with only day's notice, another Tues 1/2 off Cuts on my Wild Dining MeetUp for my 2nd time on Sept 26, 2017.  Four people ordered venison chops, I ordered the 8 oz flat iron steak (very mediocre wouldn't order it again.  I could get a much better deal and taste at Golden Corral).    My receipt says Taylor was our server, a very tall thin girl with dark hair wadded up in two buns on each side of her head.  The Organizer of our Wild Dining MeetUp ordered her chops \"medium\", but it came as the rest of ours, bloody rare and definitely NOT \"medium\".  She sent it back, changed her order to the safer filet mignon.   I would have asked them to cook the chops longer, cos I hate waste and so sad to see the venison chops thrown in the trash (they have open kitchen you can see them prepare the food).  I do not know why the server who takes the orders does not also bring the food, cos other guys brought the food, and didn't know who ordered what.  They just put the food down in front of the wrong people, and we remarked they didn't even ask us \"who ordered the onion rings\" so they could plop down in front of the right person.  So our orders got all mixed up, and they left it up to \"us\" to make the corrections.  And of course, when the bills came, they put the wrong food orders on the wrong people's bills.  And someone had to take back the checks to get them corrected.    They seemed to have a designated person just to fill people's water glasses, so that was OK, but I do not recall that our server ever came back like Sara did (and 5 times) my first visit , to check on us.  I only saw Taylor when she took our orders.  In the end, we all talked about how poor the service was, especially just bringing the food and putting the wrong items in front of the wrong people without asking.  Myself, and the MeetUp organizer talked to Manager Brandon about being so unhappy with the service.  He appreciated our feedback and said they will do better next time.  1 or two stars for this second visit.  OK, third visit is Tues Oct 24, 2017, when I repost the same MeetUp as above to Wild Dining.  We sit at the same table for 8 in the back, and about 9 people on the waiting list occupy two nearby booths.  GM Brandon is no longer working there, already, so I told Kiley, Acting GM and bartender, about our poor service the previous time.  Kiley comped our table of 8, several free appetizers, and deliberately assigned my favorite Sara to be our server.  Sara did a GREAT job, and both Kiley and Sarah came back to ask us if everything was OK, several times.  Almost everyone ordered ribeye, and it was all perfectly grilled.  So delicious.  We all loved the food, and said we will be back again and again, but no one said they wanted to come back and pay full price on another night.  We will come back on Tues nights for half price cuts.  I give my first and third visits 5 stars for food and service, but 1-2 stars for the second time.  So overall 4 stars.",

The buns they use are super fresh and they add a lot of cheese so it's especially melty and delicious. The sauce they put on the burger is to die for. Overall the burger is simple but because their ingredients are so high quality it makes the perfect burger that is amazingly juicy. I also love the dill sauce that comes with the fries!",

They had an actual DJ playing music while we ate. He had a great variety of songs. They were also playing the ASU football game and the DBacks game on the tv so I was happy with that. The first issue came when we didn't get acknowledged at the table for about 15 to 20 minutes. We didn't even have any water or anything while waiting for a waitress to come over. Once we order the food came in a timely manner. They forgot the bacon on my burger but the guy who brought out our food immediately got some bacon and gave it to me so that's fine. My girlfriend had the salmon and mashed potatoes and both were very good. My burger was cooked perfectly and was very good. The fries, on the other hand, were not good at all. They were overcooked. Like they made them previous and then dropped them in the grease again to give to me. My girlfriend also had the blackberry mojito and that was amazing as well. Overall, though this place is on the pricey side it was a decent experience.",

The salt and vinegar fries...amazing! The zucchini...not so much. The tempura batter was uneven and in many places the zucchini did not have any batter and then in other places on it had a clump of batter. Plus, they were a bit greasy. I ordered the chopped salad with grilled chicken and my hubby ordered the classic burger medium well. Before our entrees arrived the manager stopped by and said as a thank you for stopping in they were going to comp one of our appetizers. Nice! My salad was okay but not something I'd order again. They need to add more \"stuff\" to it...it only had a sprinkle of corn, a few blueberries and clumps of goat cheese(too many) with a blueberry balsamic dressing and then the chicken. My hubby's burger was over cooked and very dry. He didn't finish it, which is not like him! Anyway, that's my story.  Maybe we should have sent back the zucchini fries and his burger and maybe I should have ordered a different salad, but we did not. Their menu is extensive and the veggie burger sounded interesting. But I'm not sure if we'll try this place again.",

My burger was good, but not worth the aggravation. Also, the menu suffers from an identity crisis. Is this a burger place, steak and seafood place??

    "text": "The Atmosphere/Ambiance is actually a 5 star rating for me.   The food, while it tastes good is over priced for the portion size they serve.  For instance, I was going to order a burger yet when I saw the servers bringing them out, all I saw was a huge bun and a tiny patty inside.  We went with a salad and Short Rib Sandwich.  There was maybe 6 ozs at most on the sandwich.  Had great flavor though.  We also ordered the Mac n Cheese side.  This portion was actually not bad and it too tasted really good.    As this is owned by FRC, the drink size/quality is not the same as their other restaurants (i.e Olive and Ivy).    We spent $80 with tip (had a couple of cocktails) and walked out of the restaurant very hungry still.  As much as we would like to return, due to portion size for the higher price, I will probably choose somewhere else.",

They really thought of all the details. We were sitting at a booth, but I happened to notice that every couple chairs at the bar, they had USB ports for your phones! GENIUS! Now, THAT'S how you keep people in your seats! (Aside from great food of course) The food was really good! We started with the onion rings, which I loved the concept of, however the ranch dressing seasoning was so thick and heavy that they were way over-salty. It was to the point that it burned your taste buds almost and hurt from all the salt. I REALLY wanted to like them, we just needed the ranch toned down.  Both of our burgers were phenomenal! Perfectly cooked, great flavor!  We shared a side of the mac & cheese...which I could eat every day for the rest of my life, quite happily.  We really enjoyed watching the bartender work, they seem to really put a lot of effort into their drinks and create really unique products. We didn't try any ourselves, but it sure made us want to! Overall it was a great experience, my largest complaint is just the price is really steep for burgers and fries kind of food. It was delicious! But not worth the price tag. However, I know they recently started a $10 meal deal which definitely has me interested to go back!",

Once we got in and ordered drinks (house made lemonade and vanilla soda), we noticed that both tasted very weird. The lemonade was so unbearably sour, and the vanilla soda was watery. Our server disappeared for 10-20 minutes at a time, and upon ordering from their very limited menu, we were very underwhelmed with the food. She ordered a burger, and I ordered a salad. The server offered to put a veggie patty in the salad, but said nothing about the price, and there was no indication on the menu. When we got our receipt (which wasn't split) there wasn't even a proper line item to charge me FOUR dollars for the patty.  We had no clue what \"food $ amount\" as an item on the receipt even meant and had to track down the server to find that there was in fact a hefty charge for the bland, seemingly microwaved \"veggie patty.\" The servers were all kind of absent, and dressed in very casual clothing with bralettes and belly buttons hanging out everywhere. It was very difficult to pick them out from the customers and they were very inattentive. Between the two of us we spent $50 to feel ripped off and disappointed.",

I ordered a reisling and the girl said they were out, she didn't offer any other options/suggestions. So I ordered a beer but my husband needed a minute to decide. It was about 5 minutes before she came back to ask what he wanted. Another group at at the bar and she didn't greet them she just threw menus at them and walked away. She proceeded to talk to her co-worker, and didn't check back with us for about 20min. Skip this place and head to Olive & Ivy! Their service is great and they're always busy.

The wait didn't need to be that long.  They were either understaffed or wanted to push seating past happy hour.    The food is priced pretty well.  The burgers are grass-fed and are in the low $10s.  Sides are unusual and not the standard that you would find in a burger shop.  We tried the spinach and artichoke dip and tempura zucchini fries with our burgers and they were pretty good.  The burgers themselves were okay, the meat had chewy parts to it.  Environment:  It was louder than preferred, they had a DJ spinning some good beats.  It was a blend of a Fox Restaurant with Holsteins (Cosmopolitan LV), and an All Saints Retail store.  Overall, we will probably come back, but it won't be our go-to burger joint.  The food was decent for the price, but the service was pretty bad and fairly slow.",

We got the chopped salad and they were nice enough to split it for us onto two smaller plates which I told our waitress. Most places won't do that. The salad was the bomb. The goat cheese with the blueberry balsamic was amazing, We also got the sweet potato gratin and it to was very good. Our friends got the bacon mac and cheese and the western bacon burger and they were pleased with those two also. Here's where it goes south. We shared the 12 oz ribeye for $36.00 thinking it had to be good. It wasn't. Very tough to chew and over 1/4  or more of the steak was solid fat. Now marbling is what gives the ribeye it's flavor but this was solid fat. So between the fat and what we took out of our mouths because we could'nt get through it..I know, gross, half the steak was on our plate. My friend said to say something to the waitress but I don't like doing that because our son is a server and people take advantage of you just for a freebie. When the waitress came to the table I thought better of it and when she asked how it was I said it was a little tough and fatty as she could obviously see from our plate. I added that I didn't want anything off the bill just wanted them to be aware. She looked at me and didn't say a word. Didn't think anything of it until she walked past the table and dropped a single check on it and kept walking. I told my friends I think she's annoyed. We got her attention the next time she walked by and said we'd like another round of drinks and we weren't finished eating and also when we were done could she split the check by couples. She got our drinks and split the checks and walked away again. The next few times we needed her we had to send a busboy or another server to get her. Lot's of attitude and needs to be trained on handling these types of scenarios. I still tipped her 20%.",

    "text": "My brother came here a few weeks ago and recommended we go. I was really excited to try this place out! We were told there was a wait time of 25 minutes. Well 50 minutes later after we saw two groups of people leave after going up to the hostess desk to ask how much longer, we decided to wait a little bit longer before going up to ask how much longer. 10 minutes later, I went up to ask how much longer. Was told 15 minutes, I asked if that is a legit 15 minutes as we were told originally 25 minutes. I was advised the owner told them to tell everyone there is 25 minute wait regardless of how long it will actually be. I asked where the owner was, well he was enjoying dinner with his family. Sat down another 10 minutes as and then we decided to go somewhere else. We went up to tell them and I asked to speak to a manager. 10 minutes later, no manager. I told the hostess I was tired of waiting for a table, tired of waiting for a manger, just tired of waiting for some type of service. My money will be spent elsewhere!",

    "text": "This place is great! We were five at our table for lunch, two from Colorado and three from New York. We were greeted and seated the minute we walked in. The staff were personable and knowledgeable about their food and how it's prepared (we had many questions) . Each of us had something different and every one of us loved what we ordered. Just to name a few - we ordered the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato side as an appetizer and it was delicious. The macaroni carbonara was amazing; it had a fried egg on top rather than having it cooked into the pasta; this was a great way to present the dish--cutting into the egg and having the yolk mix into the already creamy pasta..YUM! We also had different burgers that were cooked to perfection; fries that were crispy and flavorful; and the salmon that was perfect. Just amazing food and service. I would go back in a heartbeat when we visit Scottsdale again, and highly recommend this restaurant.",
