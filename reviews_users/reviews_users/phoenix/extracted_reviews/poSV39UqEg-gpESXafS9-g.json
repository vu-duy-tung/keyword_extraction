    "text": "Excellent for seafood. It's hard to find a good selection of seafood in Phoenix, but, this place has found the secret and brought to our area. I had the catfish boil. This done in a bag with veggies and a mild spice. The menu allows for a multitude of variations of style if cooking and spice selections from 0 to 5. I had the 1 spice mine was very warm. Not sure if I could handle a 5. Menu includes crabs, lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, crayfish and crab legs.  I will visit again.  I'm sure that after a few more food trials this could be a 5 star establishments.",

I picked up an order of gumbo for lunch one day, expecting what I have had at the other two locations - a soup with rice and all types of seafood in it. This was pretty much all rice, very thick, and had only shrimp in it plus a ton of sausage. It wasn't bad, but definitely less enjoyable than what I've had at the other locations. I can say, however, the space this Angry Crab occupies is very cool.... it's large and has these crazy huge fans on the ceiling.... I like that. Now, if we can get the food up to par, I'd be a happy camper! I'll most likely give this location another shot, it could have just been a bad day.",

    "text": "This is definitely a must do place for seafood boil. The food was excellent! it was my first experience of the Creole cuisine and I enjoyed it thoroughly. You can build your seafood boil in 3 simple steps - 1. choose your seafood type (priced by the pound) 2. Choose your sauce (our server recommended Trifecta (Kajun + lemon+ garlic) and it was simply delicious. 3.  Chose your spice level - anything 3 and above is order at your risk. We did our craw fish with Trifecta sauce at spice level 3 & the snow crab at level 4. Though delicious, 3 was definitely spicy and I can handle spicy food - so for those who can not handle heat, stick to spice levels 1 & 2. Their service was good too. We were seated immediately and since this was our first time there, our server walked us through their menu and gave us good recommendations. We enjoyed our meal and the whole experience. We will surely go back for more of that delicious sea food.",

    "text": "Came back in 4th of July. Knew they closed early so we hurried in. The service was awful. They were out of everything. I did the shrimp again bc it was good last time. No flavor and the heads. Omg. Last time there were no heads. I couldn't eat them. I felt so sick. Wish our server offered the option, wish she actually paid attention, no water refills. I remember gloves last time. Sad bc I liked this place and was excited but will NOT be back. This was my reply: I'm so very sorry that you had a disappointing experience on the 4th. I'd like to ask a couple of questions to see how we can fix this for future visits. First, do you remember the name of your server? Did you ask to speak to a manager during your visit? Do you remember what we were out of that night?  I would also like to state a couple of items about our service so we are all on the same page. Our shrimp boil is head-on. We don't routinely offer head-off, but we do have it available upon request for an additional $2 per pound. Gloves are also not automatic, but are offered if our Pacific Rim sauce is ordered, or if you as a guest specifically ask for them.  Regarding the lack of attention at your table, that is inexcusable, and we will address it immediately when you provide the name or a description of your server. I have copied the General Manager of the Ahwatukee location as well as one of the owners on this email.  Thank you for your candor. We can't get better if we don't know where we are weak. I appreciate your honest feedback.  I feel I have was blamed. I gave him info he requested and never heard back.",

The lighting could be better the stark light bulbs from Home Depot ceiling fans didn't work for me, an upgrade here could make the experience much better from the get-go. But the big ass fan is very cool. I had oysters on the half sell, not good room temp and chewy. Moved on to the the mussels, very different than I have had in the past, large and a little chewy again, went with the 3rd level non butter seasoning not bad. We then order the ribs, little dry but tasty, had a couple of sauces on the side that helped out, I did like the Sauces. One suggestion, get rid of the incredibly cheap plastic flatware and awful paper plates, that would like the lighting really help the overall experience. The foot is not bad, but between the two of us we still drop $80 with tip, it's not cheap and that included 2 beers and one glass of wine.

They were really not good and served with ketchup and some type of mayo dipping sauce. They were small and over cooked. Not one spec of real corn or peppers, just small little corn meal balls deep fried.  Had the soft shell crab po boy. Huge mistake. Bread was over heated, lettuce or slaw whatever it was was not fresh, and the crab was ridiculously horrible. Overlooked and pathetically small size. And when I say over cooked I mean battered and fried to the point it tasted burnt and oily and kept the flavor of whatever was previously in the oil before my soft shell! I was extremely disappointed with my meal especially after all these raving posts about this place. Not sure what people see in this place.",

    "text": "So if anyone knows me I love angry crab!! I use to go to the one on almaschool 3-4 times a week... Love love that place and the staff there is amazing ... When I found out they open a location near my house I was so excited !!! Decide to try this location out and yes the service is good and so are the food.. My cousin and I went to this place so many time Bc they have BBQ food ...   My cousin and I seriously love the new location. We haven't been back to the almaschool location for a long time :( but after what happened the last time I might going back the old location again!! The reason I give this location 3 star Because 2 weekend ago my family visited from out of town and they want eat at hot and juicy I told them they have to try out angry crab!!! Its way better than hot and juicy !!  After a little convincing they decide to give this place a try... Well let just said they'll never go back to this place again... The service was ok ... The waiter seem irritated with us Bc we were asking for to much stuff (lemon,salt,pepper,hot sauce) ... The normal stuff  ok beside that our food was raw... I'm not talking about the raw oyster!!! Our crabs was not cook!!! Eww !! Other food might be raw too but can't tell Bc all the sauce on it!!! My whole family actually got sick the next day... Everyone got food poison  trust me between throwing up and being on the toilet for 2-3 days is not a fun thing... If you have food poison before you would know what I am talking about ... NOT FUN !!!! But Not sure what make us sick from there ... The raw crabs? Oyster? Etc... We couldn't figure it out Bc we order so much stuff. It was nice they offer to cook us a new bag of crabs .. But by the time we saw the crabs was not cook we all got gross out... I'll probably stay away from this place for awhile My stomach can't handle another round like that !!!",

    "text": "This 1 star review is not for the food......the food was a solid 5. But it was over shadowed by the distractions of the management and wait staff. I felt like I was watching a three ring circus. It seems VERY poorly managed. A lot of help just standing around, talking loud and inappropriately, looking like they had nothing to do. I could see the kitchen was hustling and bustling so I wondered why the kitchen seemed maybe under staffed and the front had people standing around....perhaps the kitchen staff just knows how to work!!  I was shocked when our waitress pointed out the female manager.....VERY VERY inappropriately dressed, very unprofessional, terrible attitude. Clearly she is the problem here. My advice to the owners is to get a new manager before it's too late. The Mesa location, without a doubt, appears to be much better managed.",

    "text": "We have been frequenting Angry Crab in Ahwatukee for the better part of a year.  Great atmosphere, even better crab.  The thing I appreciate is consistency and the crab has been perfectly boiled and of high quality every visit.  You will be hard pressed to find crab as fresh as this anywhere else in Arizona.  Beyond the crab, the raw oysters on the half shell are some of the best I have had anywhere.  This has been confirmed by one of my east coast buddies that says they are top notch!  The hushpuppies are also a must have.  The alligator bites have been sampled numerous times and that is the only thing that I would give a hit or miss.  Sometimes they are amazing and others they are a total miss; typically, overcooked.  As for the BBQ, take a pass here, it's not bad, I just think there are much better places to enjoy great BBQ.  Spend your money on what you come to a place like this for............. great seafood.  For me this would almost qualify as a go out of my way restaurant.  Nothing fancy, but a fun atmosphere with great food.  A little secret, the vegetable boil is amazing; get it with the trifecta spiced at a 2 and you won't regret the choice.  Oh and you are going to get messy, get over it.  They have hand washing stations in the dining room to take care of the wonderfully sticky buttery hands after a fabulous meal.",

    "text": "Bottom line the crab was great, the service mediocre and the ribs are not worth trying.  I've been to this location twice and have eaten more than my fair share of dungeness crab, snow crab and shrimp.  The trifecta sauces at a medium level was perfect for anyone in my family.  The restaurant was fairly busy and took a little while (15 min) to see our waitress.  We already knew what we wanted, so that 15 min seemed longer in person.  Ice tea was brought out by the hostess with very little ice and was room temp shortly after we got it.  The crab and shrimp was brought out in a reasonable amount of time, but was difficult to eat (at least by the kids) because there were not crackers.  We asked one of the servers that brought our food for some, with no response.  After we asked our waitress for crackers it was another 30 minutes before she brought 1 set for a family of 4.  Later she gave us a rock that helped.  If this was a cheap snack bar maybe I wouldn't hold it against them, but for $160 tab I should at least get some crackers and a pick.  The ribs I will chock up to a lesson learned.  I should have known better than to order ribs at a crab place.  They were dry and very over cooked.  The sauce left an bad after taste that still haunts me.  If you are particular about service and expect some type utensil to enjoy your crab save yourself some frustration and go to Red Lobster or Joes Crab Shack.  If you just want some great crab in a carefree get you hands dirty type place this is it.  All that said I will visit again,  we will be equiped with our own crackers and picks, and I'll stick to the crab.",

The seafood process is picking out the protein, the flavor of sauce then how spicy you want it and you pay per pound. shrimp comes head on (so they don't have to do more work & they make more money) and was good. BBQ was very bland, no flavor and was cold even on different types of meats and plates. This place seems lmore like a novelty place with average food, not an actual restaurant. We tried it and will move on, doubt we will be back.",

Some weeks can be completely opposite. I never thought about writing a review until our experience last week.  We ordered medium chicken wings and hot trifecta 2 lbs of shrimp. The wings came out SUPER spicy (probably hot) and the shrimp came out plain ( 99% butter and 1% spices). When we ordered we asked to make sure we have enough sauce but they came in almost dry. My husband and I love this place but we just never know what we will get that night. We just dodge the bullet and hopefully they will be better than last week.",

Big trough wash sinks in the dinning room are very convenient for you to scrub your hands. Oysters on the half shell are to die for. Must try it!",

Our table was not on a budget so we pretty much ordered the seafood menu for the bag boil. All the seafood was fresh, cooked, and seasoned perfectly. We had different seasonings but did not go all the way to the extreme hot, mild was just as good as plain garlic.  Vegetables were a fun mix so at least order half. We also added the potatoes and corn. As far as appetizers, 100% the blackened oyster.  We would go just to eat those. Cost, we were not worried about it for this dinner. However,  you could easily go there and not spend a ton. Very affordable.  Full bar. We stayed with great beer to go with the food. Last but very important.  Service. Everyone was very friendly. Our server was Frankie. She was amazing.  Very friendly and helpful. She knew the menu and made wonderful suggestions.  We will ask for her when we go back (says a lot as we usually are good with anyone as long as they are not rude.) We will be back, often.",

How can you call yourself Angry Crab, yet every time I come to an Angry Crab, you have no Dungeness Crabs??? The name says Crab, then you should have some crab on hand!!!! I could understand if it was late in the evening but less than 2 hours of being open you ain't got no Crab??? c'mon man!!!...  I shared the same exact comments with our server and then later when the manager came by to check on how we were enjoying the meal. I jokingly told him 'great, if I had some crab'. This guy recognized my sarcasm, embraced it & rolled with it. Most importantly, he was genuine when he said if I could get it for you, I would!!! That went a long way with us...  The size & layout of this location I like & the bonus here is that they serve bbq & make fresh pizzas. We ordered the ribs and brisket, with the beans & coleslaw. Also had the kids fried shrimp & fries, along with 2lbs of shrimp. Meal, service and atmosphere was good and I appreciated the way the manger talked with me when I shared my frustration of no Dungeness but yet it was on special (as a mixed bag, not whole crab)...    Will I go back, absolutely... But I plan to call ahead to make sure my crab is available as that's why I go often :-)",

It's very open and the tables are well spaced, so you still have a bit of privacy when it gets full and loud. The server was pretty friendly, even for a casual place. Sure, it's not white glove service, but you shouldn't expect that from a casual place like this.  I started with the hush puppies. They were so good. Light like air, salty, and served with a great Cajun dipping sauce. I ordered two pounds of crab legs. They were well cooked and seasoned appropriately. Served with traditional drawn butter, potatoes, and corn on the cob. The coolest thing ever is that they serve it with plastic gloves. Such a good idea for crab legs to prevent your hands from smelling like butter for the next week or so. The crab is served in a plastic bag, which is unique too.  This place is definitely the best casual seafood joint in Phoenix. The atmosphere is so fun too!",

    "text": "This review is specific to the location on Ray Rd and its sub-par status relative to the other locations.  This is based on our personal experience which was mind-blowing.  The pros:  The food was solid. The food basically met our expectations and was consistent with the other locations we've been to, and we have no complaints in terms of the food.  The cons:  I've honestly taken a week to post this review to let the experience really soak in, and I figured time may temper my feelings about what just happened.  So our family of four showed up on a Friday night after calling ahead and being told a 10-15 minute wait... no sweat.  In fact, a 30 minute wait isn't an issue for us typically.  That said, when we showed up the place was probably 3/4 full, and we were told it would be just a moment.  A few moments later another foursome arrived, and they were quickly taken to one of the open tables.  Raised some eyebrows, but no sweat.  A minute later, another group arrived, this time with six... again, we are waiting (the only ones waiting), and they are taken to another table in the middle of the dining area.  About twenty minutes after we started waiting, literally standing by the hostess, no fewer than 4 more groups were taken to their seats, some booths, others tables.  Finally the hostess said \"Okay, your table is ready, follow me.\"  We walked to an empty table right at the entrance, which had remained empty from before we arrived all the way through all of the other groups being seated.  When I commented \"Wow, we just waited nearly a half hour to be seated at a table that has been empty the entire time as others were quickly seated?!,\" she replied \"Well we had to make sure your table was ready.\"  Flabbergasted I just explained to my kids that sometimes things happen that just don't make sense.    I typically tip very well, with 20% being the bare minimum even on mediocre experiences, and unless there is a reason to tip low.  I anticipated leaving a very low tip with this meal, especially when the service and attention was consistent with the hostess experience.  Other tables were being attended to, while our family found itself waiting quite a bit.  I still left the 20% tip for the meal, and we quietly left, never to return to this location.  Fortunately for us, there are multiple locations, and I'm happy to drive further for the experiences we've had in Mesa, etc.",

Had the shrimp with trifecta mild and I have never eaten a shrimp without it being peeled and deveined...so that took a lot of work. All in all it was good once the meat was out so I won't order that again. However the red velvet cheesecake was wonderful. Next time I'll try the poboy.",

Luckily there were spots at the bar for us. Bartenders were very friendly. Drinks served quickly & made sure our glasses were never empty.  Order a dozen raw oysters to start with-very fresh & tasty. I ordered the clams mild \"trifecta\" sauce-deeelicious!!  I also ordered onion rings as well-hot & crunchy. My friend ordered the Alligator basket w/beans. Alligator was yummy but the beans were a bit cold. I told my friend to send it back, but he was ok w/room temp baker beans. Great atmosphere & busy to say the least.  I've been to a similar place in San Diego that was ok. Definitely coming back to try other items on the menu!!",

I find that very weird because the many (many) times we've been to Angry Crab I've NEVER seen the crab legs come out like that. The ketchup even tasted weird. Almost as if it were mixed with cocktail sauce? It was so strange. I've never had a bad experience at Angry Crab but for the price you pay, I expect to be happy when I'm paying that much for a meal. I'm going to give them a break for a little while until they figure it out...",

    "text": "Most everything about this place is pretty good. However the service is not at all. Actually the servers can be quite attentive but they are not always. The problem seems to be the way the restaurant service is organized.  Of the eight times we've been there and ordered a dozen raw oysters as an appetizer we've only actually received the oysters four times.  And only once were they brought before the rest of the meal. Once you start eating spicy food you can't taste the oysters so it's worthless if they are not brought ahead of time.  Of the four times they did bring oysters and they did not come out as appetizers I sent them back twice.  Keep in mind that after the first couple of times I was always specific with the server about wanting the oysters ahead of the meal.  It didn't help.    We usually all order shrimp. The orders don't come out together and can be five minutes or so between deliveries. You must open the sealed bags immediately to let the heat out or the shrimp continues to cook and turns to rubber. So some in the party are eating while others are waiting. Another reason to want oysters first. Still, we go about once a month. Food is good and prices reasonable. The issues just keep the number of stars down.",

I think it's not in the best spot since they don't seem very busy when I go for lunch. Let's hope Yelp will send more people their way in the future.  I have never ordered the bar-be-que here and I am not sure with the other choices in the valley why they even have that as an option. It just seems to make the restaurant overly smokey.  The real reason to go is to get the seafood. They sell it by the pound with whatever choice of spice you want. I usually just get traditional boil medium which is the normal \"Old Bay\" tasting shrimp.  They are always cooked very well and taste great add an ear of corn and some sausage if you are feeling it.  The mussels with the trifecta sauce ( garlic, cajun, lemon pepper ) are really tasty and well cooked everytime I get them. If you are feeling super hungry they have excellent hush puppies and onion rings.  Food to Try:  - Shrimp \"Traditional\" Medium - Mussels \"Trifecta\" Medium - Onion Rings",

The Angry Crab comes as close as you can get and maybe is even better!  I had the shrimp in mild (not really) Trifecta sauce and it was delicious.  Very casual, very messy and very good.

    "text": "I visited The Angry Crab about a week ago and I have to say that the food was very good. The service was exceptional, however, the restaurant did not notify us that there was no more chicken until we had already sat down and began with ordering food. This was slightly inconvenient because if the hostess would have told us the information about being out of chicken, we would have had time to politely leave and go somewhere else. Despite the error, the rest of our experience was exceptional with a few little things that our server would do like take long to write down one order. She was very friendly and overall, our food was very good and service was good. The environment was also very clean and tidy which is a major part of a good restaurant. Price was fair and reasonable for everything that we ordered and it was a large portion. The noise was also not a problem, especially for also having bar so I would definitely recommend this location of The Angry Crab. Every other location also has great service so with that, it deserves 4 Stars!!",

After a lot of recommendations from friends and amazing reviews on Yelp, my brother and I decided to step outside of our usual seafood comfort zone and try some New Orleans style crab, shrimps and mussels. We definitely weren't disappointed! The food was delicious and it paired well with the awesome customer service we had from Dawn! (She's amazing, if you can ask for her table!) We were recommended the Trifecta sauce #2 hot level (we probably could of handled level 3, but wanted to keep it safe) Ordered the Snow Crabs, Shrimps and Mussels - all so delicious and spicy! Ended up ordering another bag of Crabs and Shrimps to go for our parents  -- Word of caution: Did ended up getting sick afterwards that night and next day... I don't know if this happened to others that night 2/16/16",

I also had one lb of blue crab. This I was not impressed with growing up in Maryland I know exactly how the consistency of the crab meat should be and this wasn't it. You also only  get two crabs for $13 back in Maryland you can get a whole dozen for two dollars more however this is the west coast so I get it. All in all  I enjoyed the shrimp I wouldn't get the crab again maybe crab leg or muscles in addition to the shrimp next time. The corn and potatoes were also pretty good The server was average but nice I guess.",

I love fresh oysters and I found it really hard to eat these due to the scent and dinginess. Went to the one on Alma School and had a much more positive experience with their fresh oysters. I found this odd.  Bbq brisket makes it worth coming here for sure! Full of favor, melt in your month tenderness, just all that you've been looking for!   Their spice scale is legit too. I can handle a 4 out of 5 pretty well. It gets me sweating however if I up it to a level 5 out of 5- whoooooo! I'm usually crying as I'm eating. If you want to watch your calorie intake- ask for water base instead of butter. It's not as fun to eat but the favors get across. Ohh and it tends to be a lot more spicer if you go water base. Just FYI",

They do birthday shot outs by ringing a bell and siren so loud it could freak you out at first. We experienced a handful of shot outs tonight so we got used to it.  I ordered a pound of shrimp (heads on of course) with corn, sausage, and red potatoes smothered in a trifecta sauce. Its served in a plastic bag, you have the option to increase the spicyness of sauce but I chose to go with none this time. Everything was delicious but the best thing were the sausage. It's a smoked sausage but together with the trifecta sauce it just pairs so well.  Two things were not so good here. My wife ordered the shrimp po boy which she didn't enjoy very much. It had more breading than needed and the bread was stale. She had the sweet potato fries in the side which were good. The other thing is they fry the kids chicken tenders with the same oil they fry fish in. If your allergic to fish or don't enjoy the smell then you shouldn't order any poultry.  We didn't get to taste the BBQ this time around but we will next time.",

    "text": "Reminded me of a seafood boil in Maryland. Went here tonight with a few friends and we were lucky that we died not have to wait. Place was busy but not crowded. This location is quite large (I have not been to other locations yet) and had a festive seafood vibe... think sea related knickknacks throughout the restaurant. Clients are even encouraged to write on areas of the wall. So basically very laid back and fun atmosphere.   Our server Marena was great! She explained how the menu worked and helped make suggestions for us including explaining the heat levels very well. We started with the charred oysters on the half shell . They were delicious and were covered in  a little cheese and red pepper flake and served warm. We ended up ordering Shrimp in the Trifecta medium sauce, King Crab in the same sauce and mussels in the Pacific Rim sauce. The spice was good.  Next time we will order a little spicier but we were playing it safe this time. Of the two sauces I preferred the flavor of the Pacific Rim. It just seemed to have more Savory elements. The trifecta sauce wasn't very flavorful more spicy than anything but still good. The seafood was all fresh and delicious. Oh, and we had Hush Puppies they were yummy; I highly recommend ordering them if you go.  Seafood is served to the table in a steam bag with the sauce. We ate it straight out of the bag but I suppose you could dump it on the table as well. All in all, things will get a little messy but the staff is prepared for it and gives you gloves so you don't need to get the spices under your nails and a bib to cover your shirt. There are also a couple of convenient hand washing stations in the restaurant.   The restaurant also serves barbecue and pizzas with seafood. The bar has a decent selection of beer.",

One cracker,  bucket for shells,  napkins,  paper cups for your drinks (bummer), plastic spoons (bummer) for the side of rice we ordered (again no plates). Served simply!  Served cheaply!  The shrimp was cooked beautifully. The whole lobster seemed to need another 2 minutes for cooking, but rather that than over. (I enjoyed it). Oh and the rice...was nice!    This is a good option. Walking in reminded me of Crab Shack in some respects. But definitely not like Joe's Crab Shack. Tastes better. Tastes fresher. More flavor options.",

Arrived for happy hour and our party was seated in the booth we didn't really want (but all the others were dirty - with the help having no interest in cleaning another for us).  Sat in the booth for ten minutes without acknowledgement.  The four of us moved to the bar seats.  We were handed menus nicely enough, but then the service disappeared again, no acknowledgement, no orders placed.  Waited another ten minutes, watched the help argue with one another about goings-on, got impatient and left. We were fans of Angry Crab when it opened and have become less so over time.  Haven't been to Angry Crab in six months but I suggested we give it another chance.  Oh well, we won't be back.  Too bad.",

They went above and beyond! I am a pescatarian, and don't eat meat or when the food touches meat, I requested the sausage the other party ordered be in a separate bag, when they brought out the food they made absolute sure they distributed the bag so I didn't accidentally get the one with sausage, since the orders were the same. They brought us a TON of gloves so I could double glove it, and kept checking on us making sure our drinks were full and needs were met! The food, as always, was cooked perfectly and FRESH! The quality is second to none! I love coming here for the food and the service. I have NEVER had a bad experience or been disappointed!",

We got king crab shrimp  and vegetables corn etc.  it came boiled in a bag and the bag comes to table in dirty looking bucket.  You struggle to open bag then dump it in table which about the grossest.  I wouldn't have bitched if the king crab wasn't so over cooked and if anyone cared.  I don't normally eat shrimp with their legs still attached and eyeballs staring at me and also not deveined so I had to do all that at my table myself which is disgusting.  I ate 2 and then I just didn't want it because it was not even good.  So we left all that crap on the table.  The crab legs so over cooked they were $30 of rubber but of course she didn't come back to Check till the bill came.  We kept trying to get her attention but she was having conversations that looked intense.  When she asked how it was I said crab completely over cooked no saving that and she says I'll let them know right away then just comes back with bill.  I won't go back and I posted my receipt for my stalker Riggs,that accuses me of trying to get free food because I left a bad review of wildflower in Tucson.",

    "text": "I wanted to visit this place for a couple years (after I read a great review in the paper) but I don't live close to the Mesa even when I'm in AZ  from a cold and distant land. So I was happy to hear an ACS opened on Ray Rd.  My Ahwahtukee sister and I happened in last Saturday. We were greeted by a friendly face immediately and chose to sit at the bar for a cocktail and appetizer. The limited alcohol selection (to me) did not stop our fabulous bartender Jeff from figuring out our taste preferences and mixing up quite a delicious cocktail served in a mason jar. Jeff showed us the bottles of Ted's Vodkas and pointed out that this blend uses only natural ingredients to flavor its vodka. Quality is found in the details.  On to the appetizer. Since we were newbies to the procedure, Jeff again took his time to question us about our desires. Because the appetizers were fried, we decided on a pound of boiled shrimp with a side of Cajun fries. Excellent choice! Easy enough system; 1st choose the seafood, 2nd choose the sauce (tribeca) and 3rd choose the spice level (= heat index). My sis isn't a huge fan of hot and spicy food so we got level 1. No heat to cloud the flavor of the shrimp. Although I will get a hotter level next visit I must also say the shrimp was EXCELLENT and cooked to perfection. I cannot stress the perfection part enough. Tender as young love. And having read reviews before visiting I knew that  the meal could be messy but couldn't care less when I was enjoying our meal so fully. Jeff checked on us often and suggested another sauce to try, the curry coconut sauce. You bet, bring it on Jeff.  Well, I've been around quite a number of years and eaten a whole lot of a variety of foods and flavors. So when I am introduced to a new taste sensation I am thrilled. By now you may have guessed it, ecstatic! I was fully in the throes of a flavor extravaganza. Just so very good.  Lessons learned: Go back to this Angry Crab Shack. Let Jeff be your guide ( or Mike who trained Jeff) and enjoy the whole experience =)",

So you order a# of whatever seafood you like (i.e. Shrimp or mussels or crab legs...) you order the stewing sauce ( I did garlic butter) then the heat level, I got #1 and it was a little spicier than I would've predicted but good for me. I would recommend the blue crabs as they don't have a lot of meat and weren't filling. Otherwise we got shrimp (nice size with heads on a lot of shrimp for around $13), mussels (very tasty and fresh), crab legs ($18). All very good and fun eat with your hands food. Hush puppies were yummy, slaw looked good, gumbo is a popular dish, they also do smoked meats on buns and pro boys... had bourbon pecan pie for dessert which I will get every time I go. Our waitress was helpful in explaining the menu and friendly and listened to all my husbands bad jokes. Great place, low key.",

    "text": "I was visiting Phoenix with my boyfriend, and it was our last night in town.  We had an early flight to catch, so we stayed not far from the airport.  I ended up finding this place on Yelp because it was close to our hotel.  I didn't know what to expect because we had never had seafood boil together before.  I thought the restaurant was a bit hard to find because it was tucked away in a shopping area, but maybe it was also because we are from out of town.  On the inside, the restaurant is spacious with high ceilings and a very causal feel.  There's also outdoor seating, but it was about 8:00 PM in November and too cold to sit outside.  After we sat down our waitress came and greeted us and explained how to order and how the food is cooked.  We ordered crab legs and shrimp and added two cobs of corn.  After placing our order, the food came quickly and smelled great!  The seafood was delicious, especially with the sauce.  The restaurant provides you with tools for eating the shellfish, but be ready to get messy.  You also get a bucket for discarding the shells.  The only thing I didn't like about the meal was the fact that the corn on the cob was completely overcooked and soggy.  That wasn't a big deal because obviously the corn is not the highlight of the meal.  I would recommend ordering the corn and just asking the restaurant not to steam it in the bag with your seafood, but instead, add it after everything has been steamed.  After finishing your meal, there are conveniently located sinks around the restaurant for you to wash your hands.  We got to the restaurant late, so we were here past close, and the restaurant staff were very polite about it.  At no point did we feel like we were being rushed out of the restaurant.  In fact, the restaurant was still serving another couple who got there even later than us!  Great food, great customer service, definitely recommend this place for a fun, delicious, and unique experience!",

Mine had snow crab, cod, shrimp and a variety of veggies and one piece of pineapple. I point out the pineapple because the pineapple with the spices was wonderful! I wanted more!!!   My friend had dungeonous crab trifecta medium. Medium has a good kick. It too was awesome.    The way it's served is literally in a plastic bag with a bucket for your scraps. The eating style is very messy - thank goodness for the bib and nearby sink to wash up in. The food was delicious!!! Neither of us finished our meals but who doesn't love leftovers!?  Fun environment. Don't wear clothes you're afraid of getting dirty. My friend ended up with trifecta sauce on her white pants. Ruh roh!  Also - don't go if you're in a hurry. It's just not that kind of spot. Do write on the wall!",

After 20 ask for an update \"I know m'aam I can't make my servers too busy or predict when people are done\" no apologies and an attitude. 40 minutes later finally get a table a reserved that morning 45 minutes after arriving and 40 minutes after our reservation. While mind you 4+ open tables but suddenly they don't have a server for that area? When they all  literally served parties before us....Get seated order drinks and then ask when delivering said drinks to order our food. She-Frankie literally couldn't do that. She was sorry but someone else's Salmon is burnt so she can't take her tables order... FF -order taken, 20+ minutes later after all still waiting for food. Frankie let's us know I'm sorry we are out of x...great for us to know that-20+ minute post order. Then meals come 1 by 1 auctioned off throughout a 10 minute time span and finally at 903 for our 730 reservation the table actually had food. (Minus what they were out of and told us 20 minutes after so yay for bread). The manager never came over he actually walked past our table and avoided eye contact.  The host never apologized the server wouldn't take our order, then after we order takes 20 minutes to tell us out, empty glasses just the definition of terrible.",

Of course that was the main thing we were excited about going for and it was a huge disappointment. However we really enjoyed the shrimp with the head cut off as well as the trifecta sauce level III. The two didn't have much spice at all so I recommend the three if you want some kick! Definitely add the sausage and potato to your order they're super cheap but very good! I also like that their beer prices were pretty good even off of happy hour. They probably lost a little money from us with how long they took to bring the beers out ... probably would have had four instead of the two we ordered  We will definitely go back but stay away from the gross crab.  A fun dining experience!  Update: Been back plenty of times once we got the hang of this place down and now it's our absolute favorite place to eat... so addicting. Now we just order the shrimp with the heads off in the trifecta sauce with potatoes and sausage. Plus we sit at the bar and the service has been amazing!!! We love this place now!!",

The food is good (although it would be nice to get a metal for when eating crab or shrimp). In the past, the beer was not cold enough, but my buddy talked to the new owner and they made changes.  Now the beer is plenty cold. I've had wine there once and would not repeat that.  Nonetheless, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some informal eats with a few beers.",

Hostess told us about a 15 min wait for a table and the wait seemed shorter than expected. The place is one large room so the noise level is high. Butcher paper on the tables and plastic bibs, usual seafood stuff. The food came out in drips and drabs but we were told this at the beginning. Natalie, our server was very knowledgable and very courteous. She explained how the menu works. I ordered the dungeons crab. Came out hot and cooked perfectly as ordered. Food was tasty and if you don't mind getting dirty and eating with your hands, this is the place. I asked about happy hour. Would love to see lots of fun oyster shooters there. Will def be back!",

YOU are meant for the magnificent seafood in a bag seasoned just the way you like it, just as spicy as you like it, with as many little potatoes & mini corn cobs as you want!  My personal favs after multiple test runs: Mussels in Pacific Rim, with 2 potatoes (trust me, scoop up that sauce) Shrimp in the trifecta, with the corn cobs (really complements the sweet corn) Snow Crab in the Traditional Boil (doesn't overwhelm the perfect crab flavor) NOTE:  Sauce is One Level Hotter than you would expect.  I LOVE hot food and Mild is just fine for me at this place.  Don't overwhelm the natural flavor of the seafood by kicking it up a notch!  We once went there TWICE in one day - ain't no ignoring the Crab Craving when it hits!  Don't judge til you try it for yourself!  Awesome floor plan.  Great service. Wash it down with some local beer on tap!  Rinse, Repeat!!",

The level 3 \"hot\" was great for someone like me that enjoys spice. I can't imagine how spicy level 6 is. My boyfriend got the BBQ. He had the brisket and ribs. The ribs were a bit dry but the brisket was amazing!! I wasn't expecting it to be that good coming from a seafood place. Definitely will be going back .  The only downside was the wait, I feel like it's always at least a 30 min. wait. We decided to just eat at the bar, and were served right away.",

    "text": "We were immediately taken aback by the cold, uncaring greeting by the hostess(es) and waitresses when we walked in. We'd never been here before and wanted to have a great first experience where we weren't sat in a corner, facing a wall in a side room. We asked if we could have a booth or a table out near the middle where we could see the TV's and be part of the experience. We got a serious eye-roll and some Additional bad attitude. Honestly, wanted to walk out at that point. But, we were on date night and wanted to make the best of it. I'm glad we did, read on....  Service: Our waiter was great. He was honest and friendly and knowledgable about the menu and restaurant. He was attentive and took great care of us. If it weren't for the exceptionally poor \"face of the business\" (hostess), the service would have been rated higher. I'd give it 3 out of 5.  Food: it was excellent. The shrimp, potatoes and corn on the Cobb served in the bag was fantastic!! The sauce (trifecta) was awesome on all of it! The bbq brisket was outstanding!! We were very surprised at the quality and quantity of the bbq at a restaurant that doesn't exclusively serve bbq, really excellent! 4.5 out of 5.  Price: we were surprised that with beer, bbq, seafood and a couple sides we were still only around $50. 3.5 out of 5  Atmosphere: It's a weird location at the end of a relatively hidden strip mall the building and the entry around the side/back. This makes it kind of cool because it's a \"local hidden gem\". It's fun inside with the wait staff yelling out at times, a bell rung at times, TV's and lots of people enjoying great food in a fun way. 4 out of 5  I can't think of another place with better seafood and served in such a fun, hands on way,...including bibs, butcher paper covering the tables, galvanized trash buckets, no plates or silverware, and gloves if you want them,....really, really fun! Excellent seafood! And, great bbq.  I'd go again, often if I could. Looking forward to taking the kids. I highly recommend trying this place. Maybe it'll become a favorite for you too.",

We did have the private room reserved, but when we arrived the manager told us in a very rude way that it was not available. Since I don't eat crab my choices were limited. Burger, chicken and choice beef, whatever that is? Then I saw a bbq menu. I opted for pulled pork and brisket.  The pork was ok and had a decent flavor. The brisket was barely edible. My wife and daughter liked the food. That's why I'm giving 2 stars. The service garnered less then the standard 18% added for 6+ groups. Never did get the knife I asked for. Glad I had my trusty Kershaw. So if your not a seafood person, skip this place, there's nothing here for you.",

Everything is like this, the portion sizes, the flavor, the service. No consistency at all. How can your cole slaw change from visit to visit? Or the gumbo? Last gumbo was all okra and sauce, no shrimp, no sausage. What gives?",

There's a big sink in the corner where you can wash your hands instead of going to the bathroom, which was very nice. They have wooden wall for you to write and doodle.  I like the big screen TVs in all corners so you can watch the games and enjoy good foods.   Talking about the food, we ordered oysters, Cajun fries, snow crab, craw fish and shrimps. They have 1-5 spice levels, we went with 4. I love the spice level and the sauce was great, but I feel like it wasn't marinate long enough. It taste good on the outside but it taste so bland on the inside. So what I did was peel all the shrimps and craw fish and soak in the sauce for 2 or 3 mins before I eat them. Cajun fries, I expected a lot more than just a tiny basket.   About the service, he was nice but it takes him a long time to take our orders and get our drinks out. I think he try to be funny and I know a lot of server want to have that connection with the customers but sometimes it can be overboard and offensive to others.   I wouldn't return or recommend this place.",

I knew items were cooked in the bag but I didn't realize they were served this way too. The only 'dishes' were a fork and the alcoholic drink glasses. The shrimps had their heads, which grossed me out. Both the shrimp and the crab were covered in sauce and so ungodly messy that I just really didn't enjoy it like I wanted to. Call me a prissy, no gunk on my hands, girl, but I just really didn't like the experience. The food itself was good and the service was ok, but I just don't know if this place is for me.",

The total opposite of garbage like Red Lobster. The King Crab legs in the Trifecta sauce (medium spice) was delicious. Seriously, delicious. The medium spice had a pretty good bite to it. The shrimp in the Trifecta sauce is also amazing. Ordered corn on the cob as well, and it was nice that it wasn't soggy. I also recommend getting the sausage with your order. It's great with the Trifecta sauce.  Love the eat with your fingers thing they have going on. Just make sure you have plenty of napkins at your table. Very cool that they have hand washing stations as well.  The prices I think are not too bad. You will pay market prices for the crab legs, but all in all with a few drinks, it was very reasonable.  Can't wait to go back! They are only open at 3pm right now and don't do take out, but they say this will be changing in the near future.",

We had 7 people, 3 meals came out fairly quickly, then another about 15 min later, then another, and the last two didn't come out until we had to leave.  Not to mention the calamari wasn't ordered at all.  At one point, I got up and looked for a manager.  One waitress asked if I needed help and said she'd get him.  In the interim, the missing burger and fried cod plate hadn't made an appearance yet.  The manager came by, said he's sorry, there was a printer mess up and they're trying. He said he'd take care of the missing meal and he's giving us 15%off.  That was nice of him, but the waitress and the manager both didn't seem to really care.  Two of our party didn't have food, and as we were leaving, the burger came out and lol... it was COLD! Half hearted uninterested conversation about how it takes so much longer to make a burger....BS!!  Bottom line is, service, organization, and professionalism are severely lacking.  I had a much better shrimp po boy at Popeyes than at at this joint.  This is my second time at this place, and the second fail.  No time for a third mistake. I highly recommend NOT going to this place.",

I like that once your meal is cooked they bring it out so it's not sitting at the window.  All four people got their meals within about a four minute window.  Can't wait to go back!!!!! It was a little loud but when your eating with your hands you enjoy the music and the mess you will make!!!",

    "text": "Took my mom and step dad here last weekend after hearing great reviews from my friends. Food was excellent, place was clean and the server was pretty attentive. We got King Crab Legs, Snowcrab legs and a whole lobster with the trifecta sauce. It was all excellent and the sausage and corn were as well. Mom had some ribs also and those were great too. Bit of a wait on Sunday night but was only 10-15 minutes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the way the menu works - I really wanted to try a bit of everything but Angry Crab only lets you order a minimum of 1 pound of each type. So unless you come with 5 or more people, or have a huge appetite and $200+ to spend, there is no way to have more than 2-3 things of the 9 different kinds of fresh seafood on the menu. It would be nice if they had a some type of combo offering like Joe's but other than that - it was excellent.",

The server (a very nice young man) began his introductory comments with a list of menu items they'd run out of, and it went downhill from there.  I ordered the Grilled Salmon over Rice, and found the salmon to be seriously over-cooked.  The coleslaw was inedible.  Scanning the other Yelp reviews, it appears that our experience might have been an anomaly.  Having said that, it's unlikely that I'll return to this restaurant.",

However, the best experience was definitely the food. Our table of two ordered one pound of shrimp, one pound of snow crab legs (both trifecta style and #5 heat) and a basket of fried shrimp with fries; all of which was devoured with much gusto! The #5 heat had a nice kick and comes highly recommended if you like it spicy... The surprise star of the meal were the French fries; I could not stop clawing at them! Cajun seasoning FTW!  The service was also excellent. Our server (Dawn) made sure my water was topped off while I was hastily scarfing down shellfish. I hope more restaurants like Angry Crab scurry into Ahwatukee!",

Anyways, this was the first time I had ever gotten snow crab. The king crab (which is usually what I go for at any seafood restaurant) was a tad pricey, so I passed and decided to try something different. Nothing compares to king crab legs, but the snow crab was a close second! I got the sausage added in there and that was also very good! I'm glad I stumbled on this place...it's seriously a fantastic spot if you're in the mood for good seafood.",

The next video was a patron eating at Angry Crab in Phoenix and his mouth began salivating.  So we ended up here, this place was closer than Mesa.   We were seated quickly and since it was our first time, our server was so gracious to go over how to order our meal.  Luckily I had looked up the menu on their website and looked at pics posted on Yelp to get an idea. My son really wanted blue crab and he was bummed that they did not have that and his second pick of dungeness crab available.  I was relieved.  I did not want to clean crab.  I'm not lazy.  My husband has more patience than I do with cracking and removing the shell from any crustacean.  We settled on shrimp with the Trifecta sauce, and added the sausage and red potato.   Ordered raw oyster and po boy oyster, cause I just love oyster. My son was so excited when he got his bag of shrimp doused in that yummy Trifecta.  It was messy but oh so delicious!  I taught my son to break off the head and slurp on the head that contained all that yummy goodness, cause that's how Asians do it.  The oysters were really good too, and I slurped that stuff down to savor that briny flavor.  My po boy was pretty good too. My son plans to return with my husband since they love seafood, especially crab.  Hope they have the blue crab on his next visit.",

    "text": "So glad Angry Crab came to Ahwatukee. Food was full of flavor, drinks were a good mix. Beer glasses could have been cold(er) but for the volume of business I am going to let it go. We ordered food and you would think it would all come at the same time (right?) No expediter in the kitchen maybe??  The fries arrive, then the imitation butter for dipping seafood arrives then 5 minutes later the shrimp arrive and then another 2-3 minutes the crab arrived tada!...  We had 1 lb of HEADon Shrimp.  I am not use to eating shrimp and having the devein and remove heads. I will not order them again. Big turn off! Raise the price and take the heads away please.  They were also overcooked. The Dungeness Crab  - was to be 2 LB  (actually was 1 lb 9oz) sounds like a lot but once you remove all the big shell and the claw shells it was barely enough for 2 people. BUT it was cooked perfectly and we enjoyed it the most. We wanted the Maryland crabs but the server said they were small. Being from Maryland we don't eat small Maryland crabs, they are not meaty so that is why we got the Dungeness Crab but it too was on the smaller size.   All was flavored nicely, the fries extra yummy and the service was exceptional.  Sunday night was birthday night, I think 4-5 just from the time we sat and ate. The fog horn sounds every time so everyone can clap for the birthday folks. (Do you have to show ID for those B-days?...my birthday may be in a few weeks :)    Nice to see Nascar was on 1 TV so I could see the end of the race.  The LIGHTING....  Dim the lights a little please. (cheaters beware brights lights) I know you are a restaurant, I didn't think I needed my sunglasses indoors 8pm.   I didn't like the napkin holders on the tables - I would rather have a roll of paper towels. I didn't like the giant plastic red ketcup bottle on the tables (just tacky and cheap) Headon shrimp - We don't buy them that way in the grocery store why sell them this way.  All in all I will stop back in a few to give it another try.",

    "text": "I was so excited to have an Angry Crab in our neighborhood. I'm happy to say it didn't disappoint.  Marisol was out waitress and server. She was so friendly and attentive. She took the time to explain how everything worked for my fiance who had never been to an Angry Crab before.  I ordered the Calamari Strip for an appetizer and my fiance ordered the Gumbo. My Calamari was cooked just right. But, my fiance ' s Gumbo stole the show!  It was seasoned perfectly and had mouth watering flavor. I tried to order one to go before we left but it was all gone.   For our main entrees I ordered the Snow Crab Legs with the Trifecta seasoning level 2 for the spice with corn on the cob, sausage and red potatoes. The crab was moist and bursting with flavor, as were the potatoes and sausage.   My fiance ordered the King Crab legs with the Trifecta Seasoning level 2 with corn on the cob.  He could barely talk from enjoying his food so much. We were both very impressed with the service and we're quite surprised to find out that one of the owners refilled our water. So nice and humble!  All we can say is everyone was so friendly and personable.   This location also has BBQ and pizza. Although, we didn't get to try them we heard great things about those items. We will be back to test everything! Welcome to Ahwatukee Angry Crab! We're so happy to have you here!",

Good catfish platter and fries! Good sausage and potatoes with corn in the bag of spicy too! The potatoes salad didn't have much flavor though, I hadn't tried it before and wouldn't do it again....

Absolutely horrible!!  We were there for three hours!! Only about 30-45 of which was actually eating. Service was beyond slow. It took over an hour just to order. And about another hour just to get our food! No kind of apology for the slow service. But that didn't matter to the waitress since she charged each of the 3 checks a gratuity of 18%!!! Are you fucken kidding me? For what?? What actual service was provided that warranted it? Disgusting! She didn't give two shits how horrible her service was, she was going to get paid from every single family (our family included 7, another of two individuals and another of 3 all sitting at separate tables, all on different checks).   Attempted to contact the \"manager\" Dave via FB messenger to rectify the issue. Instead of making an effort to reach out to me, he requested I contact him. I did, only to leave a message that was never returned, even after following up on Facebook to advise that a message had been left.   I would have liked to have been able to tip based on the service not on our table size. I believe the other two parties should NOT have been charged a 6+ gratuity when in reality they were 2 and 3. Since I've been brushed off , I will take my business else where.",

    "text": "My family & I have been to 4 Angry Crab Shack locations. This location on Ray is by far the best one. We always get the trifecta sauce & it's amazing! I would actually like the recipe! Haha I've tried to copy it but it doesn't come out correctly. But anyways, the sauce is always consistent. We have gotten the trifecta at the other locations & most of the time they put way too much butter & not enough spices.   We get King Crab & Shrimp. By far the King Crab is way better here than the other locations. They are bigger & if you go to the other locations, the King Crab legs are way smaller.   I would definitely give this location 5 stars but the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I am VERY disappointed when I ordered rice. Got a to go order last week & ordered 2 steamed rice. Usually the steamed rice comes in a small container with a really good amount of rice which is $3. I do think $3 is a little much for rice but they at least gave you a decent amount. THIS TIME, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED because we definitely got jipped.   This VERY SMALL container of rice cost $3 EACH. We ordered 2 which equaled to $6! If I checked the bag at the restaurant, I definitely would have asked for my money back & returned the rice because THAT IS NOT WORTH $3 EACH! We normally order rice for the convenience of it already being made but we will never order rice from here again at this price for that small amount of rice. They must have just switched their containers to that recently.   So if you plan on getting rice, save your money. I have no idea if they did this at the other locations but I hope they did not. You definitely don't get your money's worth for it. The only reason why I made it a big deal is because we do order here frequently.   A couple months ago, we got a to go order & one of the things we ordered was King Crab. I should have checked the bag cause when I got home 30 minutes later, it turned out to be Snow Crab. There is a big price difference so I was disappointed and it's too far to drive. I called & I believe the manager was Michael & he was very nice. He compromised with me & I was able to send him a picture of it & he refunded the difference. He can tell I was frustrated because he did want to see it in person but I was exhausted & didn't want to drive all the way back since it's far from my house so I was happy that I was able to take the picture & send it to him.   Other than that, I do recommend this restaurant & this location.",

She had the king crab legs and I had the shrimp.   We both had the trifecta sauce and added vegetables and red potatoes to our bags.  The shrimp were tasty and nicely sized.  My wife said the crabs legs were very good with a sweet flavor.  I recommend adding the vegetables and red potatoes.  There was a wide variety of vegetables and the red potatoes were a nice addition.  The bag size portion is large so there is plenty to eat.  The next time we go, we are going to split a bag and also order BBQ to see how that tastes. The service was good and our meals came out timely.

    "text": "Angry Crab & BBQ ( on Ray Road) is a good spot for a seafood boil. I'm a big fan of New Orleans, and usually when I go on a trip there through Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, hitting up the Angry Crab on the return drive home seems to just put a smile on my face and extend our NOLA trip that little bit longer. I have been a fan of Angry Crab and would invest 30 minutes or more waiting in line at the Mesa location. This Ray Road location is a much more spacious location, meaning I get seated immediately. My husband and I always order the same thing, I get king crab and he gets shrimp. The fun is choosing which of the variety of boils to pick. My husband likes traditional ( Old Bay) and I like the trifecta ( butter, garlic, and old bay together). I always think to myself, next time I'll try the pacific or next time I'll pick a new boil, but I look forward to the flavor so much I can't do it. Also you get to pick your heat level. I warn you now, if you like it hot, they will ring a loud horn to tell everyone. I sort of forget and get embarrassed.  In additional to the many seafood choices, one can order gumbo, sandwiches, and a variety of sides. We picked the fried clams based on a recommendation of a server and they were tasty, although on this occasion had sand on them; it's a risk I guess, but in the 2 times I had ordered them at the Tucson location they were perfect. It you are in the mood for a little New Orleans, there almost always is some fun brass band music playing and it just is a delight. The cocktails are served in plastic go cups, just like many bars in the French Quarter near Bourbon Street. So get your Hurricane or Big Easy in prepare for some spicy boil and enjoy. One thing I miss at this location verses the Mesa spot, is it's so big; you don't get the same charm as the Angry Crab in Mesa. We often chatted with other customers about how hot the 4 vs 5 level was. There is a camaraderie of the patrons who you'd been standing with to get in to eat. The Mesa location had special pralines ( at least one time we were there); which is very much like going to a shop in New Orleans. The staff have always been attentive at this location, but don't seem to have the same festive energy. So when they yell out \"Hey everyone, someone likes it hot!\" and push the horn, it's on a huge group of diners, that is for the most part ignoring them.",

Marisol made awesome recommendations and substitutions.   We split a half rack of ribs and they were juicy and tender, even though we didn't have any sauce. Then we each had a pound of garlic butter snow crab legs. YES, PLEASE!  Great place if you're following a ketogenic way of eating, but don't come here expecting great veggies. You WILL get great service and delicious protein, no doubt!  And if you're bored, draw something on their walls! Our food came out really quick but we made it in before the dinner rush. We have come when it's busy and there can be a wait, but it's worth it for fresh crabmeat!",

We ordered a pound of the snow crab, a pound of the easy peel shrimp with veggies and sausage, and a side of sweet potatoes fries. The snow crab was really good. The easy peel shrimp was horrible, dried out and over cooked. The veggies and sausage were pretty good but they forgot our fries and when I reminded them they didn't come out until we were done eating. I don't think I would go back. Our meal for 2 people and a 2yr old was $75.00, I think we could have a better meal for our money somewhere else.",

The best seasoning I have ever tasted. Also got  red potato corn on the cob and the sausage in two of the bags. The orders came out fairly quickly. We opened each bag and dumped everything on the table (yeah, it's covered with heavy paper) and went at it. Fun and delicious experience. I especially liked the shrimp. They were huge and had a sweet taste that reminded me of lobster. The server was very helpful for us first timers. There are so many other things on the menu that I can't wait to try. You won't be disappointed but bring your fat wallet, it ain't cheap but worth the splurge! Several items are very reasonably priced though.",

From MULTIPLE INCORRECT orders/reorders, after consuming all the food we had to ask to get the table cleared (He only cleared it for the individual that asked when the entire table was clearly finished with their meal), Had to request a dessert menu which he brought only 1, Requested a surprise birthday cake & informed him to ask the birthday boy's girlfriend to pick a flavor and he directly asks the birthday boy instead, incorrect checks-incorrect split checks, over charges, and extensive wait to get our credit cards returned back to the table.  Emailed Angry Crab when I got home about this experience &  Autumn replied with an apologetic email and an invite back to the restaurant and stated that she would send a $100 gift card.  It's been almost a MONTH and I still haven't received the gift card.  I even sent out an email inquiring about the gift card & she stated that it was covered under paperwork and was sent the day she replied which was two weeks ago.  This was absolutely a terrible experience!!! Especially the over charge of $400!!!!  This reflects poorly on the management staff, they need to train/coach their servers.   Autumn needs to work on her follow through of customer issues.  Apparently it's not important to her which is quite astonishing. Being in an upper management position myself, I can say that any gift card, coupon, refund issues I've personally dealt with immediately to drive the customer loyalty.",

The formica topped tables are covered with white butcher paper, people eat with their hands, and writing on the walls is not only allowed, it's encouraged.  Angry Crab Shack has a team restaurant philosophy, food is delivered by the first person closest to the kitchen when the food is ready. I enjoyed ordering off Angry Crab's Menu. You pick your main course, which is sold by the pound. Then you pick your sauce, next you choose how spicy you want your entree . The boil bag is brought to your table and everything is finger food. That's right, no utensils. You even get a rock to bash your crustaceans.  Thankfully a plastic bib is given and be sure to wear your bib, because you will need it.  The prices are reasonable and food is very good.  You should give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.",

This place has dire put Joe's Crab Shack out of business by offering great crab for a cheaper price. Lots of spice blends and choice to add to your boil bad.  Con: having to pay for butter  - the corn is often old tasting and freezer burned   Potatoes and crab are great. The calamari was very good and cooked well, also.",

Idk why I thought edamame would be good at a seafood shack... it was unfortunately mushy and the seasoning didn't not compliment the soybeans in the slightest.  Came with a couple friends so it was pretty fun where we all got a pound of something different! All-in-all we were able to try shrimp, dungee crab, and snow crab. We all got the trifecta sauce and varying levels of spices. I got mine with extra fixings of sausage and corn which came out delicious. I personally wasn't too impressed with the snow crab but the shrimp and dungee crab was pretty great!  Super fun atmosphere and all of the staff were attentive, sweet, and incredibly hospitable! They recommended one pound per person is sufficient and then the current market pricing is listed on the side of the wall to the left of the bar.",

    "text": "Went to Angry Crab for the first time yesterday and I enjoyed myself for the most part. It was on New Years Day, so the restaurant was pretty empty and actually when we pulled up we were not sure if it was open. Upon walking in the restaurant is super open with a bar in the middle and several tables and booths. My friends and I were sat at a booth and greeted by Jamie. Jamie was super friendly and made us feel welcome. She was excited because it was my first time here, so she explained the process to me. I wasn't super hungry and knew I could probably take food home as leftovers, so I decided to get a pound or shrimp with the trifecta sauce and mild spice. Jamie advised us that the spices have been hotter than usual, so maybe go lighter on the spice. And since it was my first time I decided to go much lighter--so the mild or wimpy sauce for me.  One of my friends ordered gumbo to start and we noticed that the rice had not finished cooking all the way and was crunchy. Also, there was not much spice or umph to the gumbo. I definitely had better. My other friend ordered their cajun fries and they were just okay. They had a nice hint of spice and crunch.  The shrimp was okay. I thought that for the price and quality it definitely could have been better. Also, the shrimp did not reheat that well, so $20 gone. I gave them three stars because of the great service--Jamie was amazing--and the atmosphere. The music was so random and fun and made it easy to just relax and have fun with your friends. I just hope the food improves in the future.",

The hostess insisted that we sit at a table, as they were apparently attempting to close the station we wanted to be served in. I refused to sit at the table and let the hostess know that we would be leaving. She wished us a good evening and we left. Business must be pretty good to pass up a good check and generous tip on a Sunday evening. We spent our dollars elsewhere and will remember this experience the next time we are considering a visit.

Basically been to all locations and loved the food every single time.The trifecta sauce which is a combination of Cajun, lemon pepper and garlic is Perfect and pairs well with any seafood.  We generally get the shrimp or the Dungeness crab with red potatoes and corn. (Seafood is sold by the pound) Don't forget to pair it with some corn bread to balance the heat. The spice levels range from 0 to 6   Level 0- Wimpy Level 6- grim reaper  I have gone up to level 3- I can't feel my lips hot  They also have some great specials on the menu, recently tried the lobster crostini and it was pretty good with generous amount of lobster meat.  Personally this location is not my favorite because I have had a few mix ups with to-go orders but the food is Legit.  Cheers!",

Its tucked in a little corner over by frys. It was really cold inside!  I always get their trifecta sauce with a spicy level of 5. This location really hit the spot on the spice! Crab legs were good, as always. Clams were great and the shrimp always hits the spot.  They offer everything by the pound & the price varies based on the market. The price board is kinda hard to see if you're sitting far away or in a booth.   But I give this place 3 stars due to lack of service. Our server checked on us once during our meal. No refills in the whole hour while we were there. And the one time she came to check on us, she walked away before I could ask for a refill.",

It was a Sunday evening and even though there was a wait for tables we just headed for seats at the bar.  I already knew what I wanted, a pound a snow crab legs, trifecta with some red potatoes tossed into it. I normally have at Level 4, I love the heat but this time I went level 3, which still had a nice punch of heat, just milder, loved it!! Just what I was craving! Also ordered some hush puppies to share, and those too were a hit! My friend got a pound of shrimp, and he enjoyed them as well.  Even though the bar was crazy busy, service was fast and friendly. This was my 1st time to the Ahwatukee location, and set up is just like the others, even with the opened sink for you to use after eating.  Another great meal at Angry Crab, one day I'll try the bbq haha.",

I usually get 1lb of the head-on shrimp in the trifecta seasoning with mild spice- it's amazing! Add in a couple potatoes and a corn on the cob and you've got a seafood dinner for two people for less than $20. But beware, I like spicy foods and the mild is perfect amount. The Cajun fries are perfectly crispy/crunchy and the best side.   Their happy hour is also awesome- I think it's $4 wells with specials on apps and beers.   I definitely recommend!!",

HOWEVER, whoever runs this place must think it's busy enough and they are making enough money because they obviously could not care any less how inattentive their wait staff is. I suppose The folks who run this location are not aware how many tenants have been in the space over the years and think because sales have been good that they are going to stay forever. I'm not so sure at this point. I'm not even that particular when it comes to service, but this place has been consistently bad the last few times I've went. I used to be a regular customer, but will spend my dollars elsewhere now. The restaurant business is quite volatile and if you think you can not manage your waitstaff and allow piss poor service, and last a long time you've got a wake up call coming. Oh well.",

I declined a menu, and asked for a Coors light. To my surprise she asked to see my ID, since I'm 36 and look every bit of it. Got it she doesn't know me, that's not my issue. My issue is she denied me service since my ID was \"damaged\". What's the damage? Well see for yourself. I added a photo. The top right corner was slightly peeling.   She went on and stated that if the liquor board saw them excepting this they would get in trouble. I normally don't tell people my profession but I did in this case, out of utter shock. I work in the law industry and am very familiar with ARS title 4. Look it up for yourself, ARS title 4-241. It doesn't say anything about damage, just unexpired. I'll also include the link to make it easier!   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azliquor.gov%2Fassets%2Fdocuments%2Funderage%2Faccept_id.pdf&s=a107dd0f63c40c03a42bed43bc7c16a90a8bc7d782be58de6efcb074d715900e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azliquor.gov/assets/docu...</a>  I hate posting and reviewing, but this was so utterly ridiculous I had to share. I looked around to see if I was being punk'd. With my job I look at ID's regularly and can take away somebody's freedom, I wouldn't HESITATE to take this take this as an acceptable form of identification. What happened to being reasonable and having common sense?   After I told her my job and asked for a manager(at first she said she was a manager) she said well you can ask the other manager. Of course I knew that one would support the first decision but I opted to try anyways. Side note, the second manager has serviced me before, granted it had been awhile. Anyways, she said yup we can't take damaged Id's.   Now I'm starting to think if there was more to it, mind numbing stupid .",

    "text": "My wife have been going to the crab for some time now.  We visited the Awahtukee location this afternoon, ordered our regular which includes a couple orders of sausages with our boil, too our dismay the sausage was mealy and not flavorful at all.  Dave our server came around and inquired how our meal was tasting, I asked are they using new sausage, he said he would ask.  Dave returned a couple of minutes later and said yes.  We were just at the same location a couple of weeks ago and it had changed.  Suggestion- if the sausage is homemade, go back to your original recipe,  if you they are bought through a purveyor,  please go back to the previous brand.  I know if this new sausage is going to be used, I will not be buying them in the future.  Outside of the sausage, solid meal as always.",

I'll pass next time on those not worth the $.  The King Crab legs were the best!! We had the trifecta sauce medium heat & that was a little spicy but good!

    "text": "Besides sushi, I've never had crab before. I had NO idea what to expect when I walked in this place. As I took a look around I saw a bunch of people wearing bibs, licking their fingers, and slurping crab juices. I was kind of disgusted to be honest, and it was a little too late for me to back out since I was meeting a friend there.  The first thing the waitress did was cover my table in construction paper and tie a bib around me. I'm a classy lady, and this went way beyond my sensibilities. As each moment passed, I became more and more skeptical of this place and had very little interest in ordering anything. My dinner mate did not have the same feelings and ordered half the menu. Three different types of crabs, oysters, shrimp, bread, and fries. It was all delivered in plastic baggies and accompanied with a giant tin bin.  My dining mate cut my first crab leg and gave me a piece and as soon as I had my first bite of Angry Crab crab meat I was in love. It was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I didn't want to wait for someone to cut the crab meat open for me so I grabbed the crab and started tearing and ripping. I needed more crab meat. I did the same with the shrimp, and I slurped the oysters. I had sauce on my face and I was licking my fingers.   I left feeling dirty and smelling fishy but it was THE BEST FOOD that I've had in a long time. Enjoyed the food tremendously and loved the experience.",

    "text": "I'm not one to write reviews. I've worked at a restaurant so I know how it can be sometimes. But this was the absolute worst service I have ever received at a restaurant.  Food coming to the table as it's done? Alright. Fine. But when two people order the same thing, and one person gets their food and 20 minutes go by and the other person hasn't gotten their food? Something's wrong. And trying to bring out an appetizer after one person has already gotten their meal and is basically finished? Come on, now.  Once we all had our food, NO ONE came to check on us. After at least half an hour, we had to flag a busser down to find our waitress. The place was not crowded while we were there so I don't understand.  We had a party of 7. They made us write down our numbers so when she takes the order she knows who ordered what. That was pointless because it took three tries to get our bill correct. And we had to share who had what to the manager, who seemed like she didn't care about any of the issues we had and interrupted me when I was trying to explain our bills and the time we had there. I think her name was Olivia.  I will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. The food was good so I would recommend their other location and hope you had a better experience than we did.",

When we first walked it there was no one there at the hostess table to greet us and we had to wait about 5 minutes before someone showed up to seat us. The waitress/I don't know what her other job could be, took our drink order and 5 minutes later another guy comes to the table and asks us if someone took our drink order. I said yes someone took our order and he tells us that he thinks she got tied up with something and asks us again what we ordered. At this point I was getting pretty upset. I could tell the service was not going to be that great. We continued to look at the menu and I ordered gumbo for starters. The gumbo is served in a plastic bowl as if it were purchased at the store and tasted like it was reheated in the microwave. It had tons of rice and was very skimpy on the meat side. It was okay but I've had way better gumbo.   We order the shrimp trifecta ( headless) and the crab trifecta. It didn't take too long for the food to arrive and both were really good. The food is served in a bag and can get pretty messy so make sure you wear your bib. The trifecta has lots of flavor and really gives the seafood a great taste. I'll come back to try other things on the menu but the overall service is crap! I hope the managers read these reviews and get this fixed.",

The Angry Crab takes the boil-in-bag style to a new level. We had king crab in Pacific Rim level 3 (coconut curry flavor!), Dungeness crab in Trifecta level 2, veggies in traditional boil, and hush puppies. Next we ordered a lobster in Pacific Rim level 3 (yes, we liked it that much!). The seafood was all fabulous. The veggie bag is really interesting and included butternut squash, spaghetti squash, lotus root, and daikon in addition to the more traditional veggie mix. The place was pretty busy for a Tuesday night and the service was fabulous. Three different servers helped us, so we never felt neglected. One server told me that they share tips so they all help each other. It showed. This was our second visit to the Angry Crab and we loved it both times. It is a little spendy, but it's a fun way to enjoy some seriously fantastic food.",

The experience starts with hands-on white paper table cloth, personalized with the server's name and a circle designated for the \"tools\". Seriously some of the best service I've ever experienced, ours even took us on a tour of the place!   About the food- it's a bag boil with an edge. You can choose the meat and sauce, and it comes with a side of your choice. I'd highly recommend the trifecta sauce and crawfish. Super fresh and cooked to perfection. You really can't go wrong though. Cajun fries weren't the best BUT not for a lack of flavor, next time I go I'll probably ask for extra crispy. You eat with your hands, so make sure to wash them ;)  According to our waitress, this place is one of the starts to the beginning of a national chain. I just hope Ahwatukee gets more awesome restaurants like this!!",

The food was fantastic.  Started out with the fried oysters which I'm not usually a fan of but theses were very tasty. We also enjoyed the gator bites.  For our entire, we did the snow crab and shrimp.  Both quite good, but next time I'm going to do a double order of snow crab. We even tried for the first time the bourbon pecan pie which was large enough to share. It wasn't too sweet as many pecan pies are. Very good.  I highly recommend the Angry Crab and BBQ.

The lobster boil was full of mussels, shrimp, and veggies... Delicious!!! The king crab legs were ordered in a traditional boil, highly recommend this... It was the perfect amount of spice!  The favors were so good we didn't even need to order butter to dip our seafood in!  Come to this place with an open mind, eat with your hands, and enjoy!  Great addition to the Ahwatukee area!!!",

Started with Cajun fries. We ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp and a pound of crab legs.  It all cost 48.00  Very messy, very spicy, and we left very full.  I can't wait to go back and try the fried shrimp po boy.",

Their mussels are so good super big and meaty not like any other place here in Arizona. I also get the boil of veggies with the pacific rim and sausage, corn and potatoes. Super delicious. Coconut with a little kick is perfect combination. Also must try the alligator nuggets and the calamari. And for dessert their seasonal cheesecakes or corn bread with honey is delicious  We go at least twice a month and its perfect every time. From the staff to the food its all amazing. Love that they have a mindset of team work all the staff help each other. Will continue to keep going back.",

I got a pound of snow crab legs in the trifecta with a mild spice level, and added a couple potatoes and corn on the cob. My husband got almost the same, but with crawfish instead of crab legs. Delicious! Be prepared to eat everything with your hands. Don't worry, there's a hand washing station. It's great for the whole family.",

Not to mention, the smell just walking in was awful. It was an overpowering stale crab smell, which was very off putting to my appetite and I almost walked out just for that. The whole restaurant feels cramped with no room to move in between tables and very hot. Once our food finally started coming, the experience got worse. My table ordered macaroni and cheese that came out cold and didn't look fully cooked. The crab and shrimp bags were alright, however the fried shrimp, calamari, and gator nuggets were awful. They were out of several foods, including brisket and chicken, which was upsetting considering it was a Tuesday night at 6:30. Nothing here was good, especially for the price and we will NOT be back.",

The door is white and it's around the back. Now I know why everyone was parked over that way. I chose from the seafood side of the menu and had shrimp (they are huge prawns!), red potato, corn and it was delicious. Warning to New Englanders: this is Cajun spice so I ordered my sauce traditional boil (like old bay I was told) as a 1 and still thought the sauce was hot! I got the hush puppies too and they are good, but seriously spicy to me. I am glad I had a bib to wear and they provided a sink to scrub in! My dinner companion got the pulled pork sandwich, potato salad, and beans.This was all good!  The menu is awesome. You can choose off the Seafood or BBQ menu and your food will be delivered cooked in a bag, order a basket, Po boys, and there is a burger on the menu too. There is so much food on this menu I could spend a year ordering and not hit all the combos.   The atmosphere was fun with TVs all around. I thought our server was very helpful. My advice is go and try it! You will be happy to eat here.",

As for the food, it was all just regular for me.  I ordered the soft shell crab basket that comes with cajun fries and your choice of additional side.  I definitely could have eaten just that basket and been full.  The soft shell crab was decent, although I could do with a little less breading.  Not a lot of meat on it, but that's to be expected.  I also ordered a pound of the frozen crawfish.  Eesh, that was a mistake.  I didn't really know the difference between frozen and live, but I tried one of my friend's \"live\" crawfish and it was SO. MUCH. BETTER.  my crawfish had a really funky taste to them.  On top of that, I thought the trifecta medium hot sauce was a little bland.  It definitely needed more salt and more heat.  so lesson learned, there IS a difference between frozen and live, and always order the live crawfish.  however, the \"frozen\" crawfish were a lot larger than the live crawfish.  One nice touch is that they give you free cheesecake if it's your bday!  I think my favorite part of my meal was the Cajun fries... I've had better boiled seafood at other places, so I would not be that likely to come here again...",

    "text": "I'm a big fanatic when it comes to spicy seafood in a bag! I've tried many different names/restaurants and came across Angry Crab during my visit in Phoenix this past weekend and would like to share my reviews.  *****Environment: The place is definitely pretty spacious. Definitely one of the biggest I've see n compared to other competitors. I do like the big projector TV displayed by the bar, giving this place a great place for game nights and also the wooded walls where they allow you to write and doodle. I didn't feel crowded here at all. The place looked clean and smelled good for being a place that serves this type of food. The bathroom was clean and so were the heavy duty hand washing stations.  ***Food: The food was alright, it wasn't the best flavored I've had but it definitely was up there as far as spice levels. You have an option to choose from 1-5, 1 being the lease and 5 being deadly. Let's just say I got a 4 and my nose was running while I was eating. I ordered the Snow Crab, Crawfish and Shrimp. The flavor was a little on the weak side. For picking the Trifecta flavor I felt it was lacking the garlic flavor and the sauce was very minimal to where the seafood couldn't take in the flavor as much. I was a little disappointed in the sauce. Also the Oysters I ordered weren't as rich in flavor, not sure if it was a bad batch. The crawfish, I could tell were previously frozen as they were dark and the shells were tender. Other places I know charge cheaper for frozen vs fresh crawfish. But the shrimp and snow crab I feel was a good size, quality over the rest. If I was to come back I'd probably just order the shrimp or snow crab.   *Service: The server was a little interesting. It took a little longer than expected to receive my beer and also I wasn't sure if he was try to crack jokes to be funny? The reason I said that was because he offered bibs to everyone at the table. However when he offered one to my brother, he said he didn't have enough to cover him since he was a bigger guy. I found that definitely offensive, especially to crack fat jokes when we haven't established any type of friendship connections. I feel one would need to be at a certain friendship level before cracking fat jokes. My brother was ok with it, however I was. I felt it was rude and unacceptable.   Overall, I will give this place a 3 star. Would I return, most likely not, for the price I could receive much better service and food elsewhere.",

Spoke to a manger who wouldn't make eye contact and made excuses that burgers take a long time to make, and I it would be right out. By 7:10, still nothing. By 7:15, one person received their meal. By 7:20 we had to go, and two people never had a meal. And no apology from the staff or manager, just \" we won't charge you for the meals you didn't receive \" !! Really, Mr Manger?!?  That goes without saying. So odd. Will never be back. The service was horrendous",

First off, the tin can the bag of food comes in was completely rusted on the bottle, those otta be thrown ASAP- then we notice their \"king crab\" is teeny! Coulda fouled us that they been snow crab. At $30 a pound for \"king crab\" I expected some good size pieces but nope we got baby thing legs. Your better getting a case at Costco and doing your own boil. Okay so, my kids don't get their food till maybe 5-10 mins after ours does so we wait- one comes out then we gotta wait on another- we waited to eat till everyone's food was out and it took so long. Mind you, we were the only seated family there- it was dead. So, we eat finally. Foods okay, tried to hype it up but it wasn't great. Our waitress never came back for refills on anyone's drinks. We sat completely through dinner with no drinks after we asked for refills. Not till we ask for our check does she remember we wanted refills and had sat their for so long through eating. No apologies, nothing. I was so disappointed that I had dreamed of this boil for so long and now it was a complete fail to my family. We had to get dinner again because we weren't satisfied after we left. So, end story- don't waste your hard earned money here- go to Costco and get their case of king crab and make your own boil! Their case is 229$. We won't be returning here.",

    "text": "Having only been to the Mesa location it was time to try their sister location. This location I heard from fellow locals said this location has been overturned around 6 or 7 times.  But I think this one is here to stay.   There were the usual graffiti walls, booths, bibs, tvs, a and then the weird part - high top tables. The one the hostess seated us was at was a wobbly high table. And then there was a section that was empty due to no server available. Then I spotted a booth that was almost done eating. I asked the hostess if I could take that since they were done. And she said that other people were waiting 20 minutes for it and would need to go on the waiting list. I look around me and there were plenty seats available. Not sure what she is talking about. We decided to sit at the bar facing the 4 tvs puzzled to one.   Glad we sat at the bar. Great view of the tv and center spot. Bartender was good and told us about the new items on the menu from the other location. New items: bbq meats, catfish, veggies $5, salmon with veggies $16.   Went for the usual trifecta mild sauce with snow crab legs. The best!! Always pair it with corn $1 and potato $0.50 each. Tried the clams - which was okay because these were the heavy shells and tiny meat. Skip on this. Also tried the salmon with the lemon pepper sauce. Sauce was good with the veggies but bland on the salmon. Use the trifecta sauce for the salmon. Veggies included bok choy, squash, mushroom, fall veggies. I'd say the veggies were well over cooked.   The couple sitting next to us were a fun couple to talk to. And btw, the bar seating was now full. When someone orders a spicy level of 6 the staff yells and announces it to everyone. Same with birthdays. A slice of dessert like double chocolate cake or red velvet cheesecake or root beer float to name a few is given to the one turning a year older.",

The food is not too spicy we got 1 star, but you can make it 6 stars if you please.There was a good variety of seafood to choose from.  Not just the typical Crab & shrimp joint. Two of us split food. We got 2 pounds of shrimp (head on), a 2 pound dungenous crab(whole), a pound of king crab (5 legs), corn & potatoes. It was under 100 bucks (less than 50 bucks per person). Great flavor. Yummy.",

    "text": "This location is inconsistent in terms of sauce taste. I love a good bag of seafood or veggies in trifecta medium sauce but it is a hit or miss. At times the sauce is extremely flavorful and balances the cajun, garlic and lemon pepper well but other times it just tastes like spicy butter. I usually like to order the cajun fries with my seafood since the food isn't too filling. The fries are crispy and delicious and the perfect complement to the more moist seafood. I love the clams, shrimp, blue crab, and dungeness crab. They are usually fresh tasting with the exception of the shrimp on occasion. I like adding the extra potato and corn on the cob as they absorb flavor better than seafood. The pound of veggies is a great meal option for eating a bit lighter since there is a good variety in the bag. The service is nice when they aren't too busy but be prepared to wait for water refills when they are very busy. If you're in the area, and crave seafood I recommend it but if you are closer to Mesa then go there since they are more consistent.",

With the set up is very nice and very spacious. The hostess greeted us within 20 seconds of walking in the door and we were sitting at a table with our food ordered in 10. I'm pleased with the service that we received here on Father's Day.   Now on to the food! I love how well they cook the crab and how easy it was to find the meat inside the Crabshell.  The seafood was very good quality. As a black man I must say that I grew up on cornbread and I like my cornbread sweet. The cornbread they have here was virtually the equivalent to the corn bread that I grew up on it definitely made me feel like I was back home eating a hot moist piece of cornbread.   If you haven't been to angry crab I would strongly suggest getting up out of your seat after you read my review and head straight over to this restaurant to get you some good food!",

The meat is always overcooked, and the fried dishes always taste like they've been fried in the same oil they were using when they opened the place. The only reason I've given this place three stars is to recognize the efforts of the hard-working serving staff who consistently do an outstanding job and for the restaurant's relaxed ambiance. Some people here report customer service problems, but I've never experienced that.  The only dishes I would recommend are 1) the gumbo, 2) any of the seafood bags with the trifecta, and 3) that's about it since they stopped serving oysters. I'm waiting for the IPA (aka, turpentine) craze to die down so I can finally recommend the local beer list. They served me a Four Peaks Oatmeal Stout once, probably a limited holiday batch, that was awesome, but the rest of the list is not particularly impressive given the number of good beers brewed locally, and weighted heavily on the IPA side.",

The management even contacted me for more info so they could straignten their issues out.  That's nice but there is clearly a lack of leadership on site.  There are plenty of people working though.  I counted 18!!! people in the front of the house.  About half were standing around dancing and half were cleaning.  From my restaurant experience that's a very successful ratio actually.  - Still no happy hour and this time there was no happy hour pricing on drinks.  This is funny because there was last time I was there.  Also, the bartender even gave us a run down of the happy hour prices before ordering our drinks.   - Ordered some raw oysters that came out lukewarm. Once my friend and I ate 1 oyster each we just stared at each other with an \"oh no, what just happened?\" look.  If you've ever been sick on oysters you get awfully skittish if something tastes off. Especially in Phoenix in August.  We had to send them back which is an unfortunate waste of food.  What likely happened is someone put them under a heat lamp before serving.  Even if that's the case, I certainly wasn't taking any chances.   - One of our drinks was made with the wrong liquor.  They did end up comping that.   - Second time I've been where no salt/pepper or utensils are available at the bar.  The upshot here is the bartenders and staff were nice and the food is (usually) very good.  I was so excited about this location since I live two minutes away but both visits thus far have left me shaking my head wondering what's going on.  I'll be back but, quite honestly, I can't see any reason to return until closer to the end of the year when, hopefully, it catches up to itself.",

We drove from another angry crab to come here to find out that they don't have our name nor do they take reservations over the phone. Why then even ask our name? The hostesses didn't try to help. Not sure how they do business here but this isn't the right way.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went to Angry Crab Shack & BBQ for lunch as we frequently do. I usually wait until I have an extraordinary experience before writing a review somewhere. This means I have usually visited a location multiple times before writing and can give an accurate depiction of the business I am reviewing. This is one of those times and unfortunately it was an extraordinarily bad experience. We decided we wanted crawfish for lunch. Anytime we go to Angry Crab I always get crawfish and my fiance will revolve through the different menu items each time we go. Before choosing where to eat, we called Angry Crab to check the current price of fresh crawfish at which time we also asked how busy they were. The woman who answered gave the prices for both fresh and frozen crawfish as well as told us that they were at about half capacity so there wouldn't likely be a wait when we arrived. We came in about 20 minutes later and were seated by a nice waitress who quickly asked for our drink order and since we already knew what we wanted we asked to order our food too. After telling her we wanted crawfish she informed us that they had been out of fresh crawfish for months and had discontinued carrying frozen crawfish. We told her that the woman who answered the phone failed to mention that when we had called and she apologized and left us to decide if we wanted to go somewhere else. We decided to stay and asked if we could get a discount on crab because we actually wanted crawfish which also happens to be the cheapest thing on the menu. She said she would have to ask her manager and left. We sat and waited for about 15 minutes before my fiance became frustrated and flagged down the manager himself. The manager came over (who looked rather unprofessional with dirty clothes, messy hair and unshaven face that screamed \"I don't care\") and the waitress had not even told him of the issue yet. We explained the situation and let him know what we were asking for. The only thing on the menu I really enjoy as much as crawfish is king crab legs. The cost for the fresh crawfish they didn't have was $12/lb and the cost of king crab legs was $30/lb. Obviously the manager was not going to give king crab at crawfish price so my fiance asked for a compromise; king crab for snow crab price. Snow crab was $21/lb which would have been a $9 discount, I would have been happy with my dinner and we would have felt like we were compensated for the lack of communication on the phone call before we came in. The manager seemed baffled that we would ask such a thing of him, apologized (insincerely) to my fiance about 5 times and offered to buy him a beer (which was on happy hour special for around $2.50). The discount was not about the money. We could pay $30 for a crab leg lunch. Its about customer service. If you mess up you make the customer feel like they were compensated for the inconvenience you caused. I have worked in customer service long enough to know that. We declined the beer and I was more upset than I would have been had we just ordered the king crab without asking for a discount. I was honestly really irritated that I was the one inconvenienced by them being out of what I wanted to eat and he offered to buy by fiance a beer. Where is my offer? Where is my apology? Why didn't he ask me what he could do to make me happy? He really didn't even acknowledge me when I spoke which is why my fiance did all the talking. I'm guessing he assumed my fiance was the one paying so he was the one to please which is somewhat offensive because we make the same amount and share expenses 50/50. My fiance ordered mussels and I ended up ordering shrimp which was a few dollars more than the crawfish would have been and I did not enjoy it as much. The manager brought us our bill and had taken 20% off which ended up amounting to about a $9 savings which is frustrating because if he had agreed to just taking the $9 off the crab in the first place I would have ordered it and gotten what I wanted, we would have spent more overall, it would have made us feel like the customer service was great which would have caused return business and a good review. Instead he ended up giving us the same amount of money off, we spent less than we would have if I had purchased crab and we left unhappy causing no return business from us and a bad review. Hopefully they will get it right for the next person.",

I didn't get barbecue but uncle that came with us stated the barbecue sauce seemed like it had a little too much vinegar with it. I would def come back for the sea food but feel like if you are craving barbeque there's better out there. Definitely worth trying for yourself at least once here.

The Angry Crab, however, had a larger selection of fish and seafood as well as sauces and intensity of heat.   I had the shrimp with a potato and small ear of corn.  I got the Trifecta Sauce and the medium heat.  It was SO good!   The medium heat was pretty spicy, but once I got used to it, I loved it.  If you are looking for your typical Louisiana crawfish or shrimp boil, this is not the place.  Their shellfish comes in a plastic bag with the sauce you pick.  You don't need to dip it in a remoulade sauce or cocktail sauce.  It comes \"swimming\" in the sauce you select.  They have raw oysters, poor boys, gumbo and more.  The atmosphere is very relaxed.  You can't go wrong here!",

We asked for tarter sauce and got cocktail instead.  The clams came out first, then 5 minutes later the server noticed the oyster had not been served.  She went to get them.  We both ordered a side of coleslaw.  Shame on management.   For $2.00 they should serve some slaw.  I had about two table spoons of slaw, my friend had one.  It should be a least 2-3 oz or so.  Slaw is not expensive.  What I had was really good too. I really dislike the music being so loud too.  It was hard to talk over it and was not fun.   We decided probably wont' be back again.",

We started with what we thought would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table- what did we expect on a Friday night?  they send text notification when your table is available (love that!). Our table was made available much sooner than anticipated. The Bloody Mary was super delicious and came with several garnishes-including a nice snow crab leg!   Our server, Dawn, was personable, and while we could tell she was super busy, she made sure we were taken care of, and explained any expected delay!  The menu was AMAZING!  Nothing sounded bad!  I had the snow crab boil with added vegetables (1 pound!) and corn on the cob with the Trifecta sauce at level 3 heat. My companion, the Incredible Running God, was more adventurous and had the shrimp boil (complete with \"everything that shrimp was born with\" as our server put it-eyes, tail, legs) with the Trifecta sauce in level 4 heat-\"Angry ghost\". Be prepared to sweat with level 4 spice!  The kiddo had the pepperoni flatbread which sounded like a horribly boring choice, but hey, what can I expect taking a moody tweenager who hates seafood to a crab shack!  The place was packed!  And for good reason!  It was our first trip there, but certainly won't be our last!",

    "text": "Went to the Ahwatukee location to try it out tonight for dinner, fist impressions of the place was nice. The decorations were interesting. Very open, tables lined with paper, people with bibs on and the bar was full.  The hostess sat us and asked if we had ever been to their restaurants before and we replied \"no\".  She then walked away and said our server would be right with us. I was thinking she would explain the theme of the restaurant or the menu but I guess not.    Our server came by and got our drink order.  While we were checking out the bar the manager came by and greeted us and asked us if this was first time we said yes, he thanked us for coming in and walked away, again no explanation of how the menu works or how things are prepared, not a big deal our server will get to that hopefully.   The food choices is short and simple, the back side is covered in different beers.  They might have more beer choices than food.   Server comes back with our drinks and he explains the menu sections and market prices for seafood and the different seasonings. We started with hush puppies and a half dozen of oysters. We then ordered a pound of clams in the trifecta with corn and sausage. We also ordered  the soft shell crab po boy.   Oysters and out and they were nothing special, golf oysters I think. The horseradish sauce was tasty, odd they served it with limes though. Hush puppies were good odd it was served with ranch.   The clams, corn and sausage come out in a plastic bag. No plate to dump it out onto, different to be earring out of a plastic bag but kind of neat too. What surprised me was that my clams, corn and sausage were drowning in a butter garlic sauce.  not what I expected because the server didn't make mention that it was butter based until after we are and I asked him if all the sauces were butter based.  He neglected to tell us that all of them are butter based except for the plain boil which is water based and the pacific rim is curry based.  That would have been good to know before ordering. The menu states it's crab boil, I expected a crab boil.   I think I might have gotten 12 clams  and only 9 of them had meat in them. Sifting through the bag and sauce I found 1 piece of meat.   So for 12 bucks I got 10 pieces of clam. Totally understand the pound is including shell weight but at 12 bucks a pound I'd expect a piece of meat equivalent to the number of shells.   Sausage was tasty as was the corn.   The soft shell crab po boy came with Cajun fries.  Fries were really good, good seasoning and crispy. The Po Boy, not so much. The crab had a real fishy taste to it, can't say I've ever had the same taste in other soft shell crab Po Boys I've eaten before.  The breading was so so, had a very heavy taste that left an after taste.   Total bill came out to 50 bucks for two of us.  It was worth trying but for the money I've had better elsewhere. I might come back to try the gumbo.    They are newly opened so hopefully the service works itself out. I can see this place being a decent place for happy hour or maybe lunch but I'd skip this place for dinner.   Value in the food not so great, service was only ok but that should improve over time. Selection of beers was excellent. Overall I won't bring the family there but might do lunch or happy hour there.",

Maybe they didn't have enough wait staff, however, I watched them seat more than 10, 4 tops while we waited. They could have made accommodations for us?  I have been here 5 times, I liked the food and would have thought they would treat there customers better.",

    "text": "Walked into angry crab the other day and was immediately let down by the unwelcoming host. We were not greeted and when we were sat and asked for a booth we received an eye roll and sigh. Our server was slow and acted so busy when she only had about 3 other tables. Not impressed either. Another disturbing thing was hearing the young host talk about sex and other inappropriate topics  with other co workers.... we sat at the booth near a window closest to the stand and she talked very loud. She looks under age, the white girl with brown hair. I'm not sure what kind of people Angry Crab hires but they are very unprofessional. The food was amazing. I'll only order take it from now on if I ever decide to get their food again",
