Many options on the menu and so much flavor in each dish that we ordered. I had the Floridian French toast- Amazing! My daughter had a chocolate chip pancake which was also amazing! Very fluffy and it came with bacon. I ordered sausage links as extra and I liked them but my brother and father didn't. My father liked the sausage patties better. The link was much softer. Bacon was perfect. Brother had biscuits and gravy, and usually I don't care for that dish but his were yummy.   Overall, excellent.",

Our timing was good though, because a bunch of people showed up right after us and I heard the wait time grow to about 20 minutes. We were seated pretty quickly, and I was impressed by the wide variety of options on the menu. The prices looked very reasonable, but perhaps that's because I'm used to Bay Area prices. We placed our orders for the breakfast tacos, sunrise granola bowl, and the tri-athlete. I got the granola bowl, which came with a chocolate chip muffin that was delicious! It was light and airy and almost tasted more like sponge cake filled with chocolate. It also had patches of sugar crystals on the top, which was awesome. The yogurt/granola/fruit combo was filling, although I wish I had eaten it more quickly because the granola got soggy at the end. The other people liked their food too. An elderly couple sat down next to us and I was pleased to hear the waitress ask, \"the usual for you two?\" What great and friendly service!",

My only complaint about that was the back wall has a long bench that multiple tables share, and there was a little girl next to us that kept getting up, sitting down, getting up, sitting down, so the slats on the bench kept moving. Pretty annoying. But they left before long and a new group sat down that remained pretty still. Our waitress was very friendly and spoke in a calm and happy tone. But she used some weird phrasing and kept making odd jokes. So I guess she was almost too friendly and we thought it was strange, but also entertaining. I ordered the Tri-Fecta with a waffle, scrambled eggs (well done), and bacon. The food came out quickly and everything tasted fresh. Eggs were cooked right. The waffle even came with a side of mixed berry compote that was good. I also tried some of the bacon & cheddar pancake my friend ordered with his meal. It was REALLY good! Savory and delicious. We ended up taking half of it home. If we make it back here, I'd like to try the Floridian french toast... it looked pretty good.",

I was going to test my luck to see if I can order and consume an omelet within 30 minutes. I usually go to The Good Egg for breakfast for lunch but decided I would give First Watch a try.  The experience was satisfactory but not great. Server was polite enough but no personality. He did constantly fill my water which was a plus and he got my order in and food brought out quickly and efficiently.   I ordered a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes. Omelet was okay but a bit bland. Thank God for hot sauce. The broccoli inside the omelet was raw which I found unappealing. A nice saute, steam, or roast to them would have made this omelet 10x better. The potatoes it came with were obviously previously frozen, lacked seasoning, and unevenly cooked.  The good news is that I was in and out of there in under 25 minutes.   I don't think I will return on my own to First Watch. I find the food to be tastier and the service friendlier at The Good Egg.",

The food is seriously fresh and top of the line, the service is unbeatable, the atmosphere is friendly, comfy, and nice. You can tell that all around, from frontline to kitchen staff, the place is run well. My husband and I go to FW at least two weekends a month, and bring out of town family and friends here at every chance. Everyone is always so pleased and impressed, and jealous that they don't have their own First Watch locally (ahem, FWs are needed in Oregon!)  I'm having a hard time identifying single things to write about since I literally like every single aspect of the place.. One big positive: Tamara. She's usually our server and I feel like she goes out of her way to have us as patrons. She is SO sweet, friendly, and warm. We love getting her.   The house coffee: fantastic.   The waffle: stellar (do what I do and have the fruit from the Floridian French toast added to the waffle!)  The house potatoes: wayyyy better than regular hashbrowns.   The omelets: Incredible.   Tip: Sign up for their online club. FW sends me coupons on the regular and also sends me a free entree certificate on my birthday. :D   Go to First Watch. You won't regret it.",

They cooked over medium eggs like over easy eggs. Cooks take note: if the white of the eggs is still runny, it's not over medium, it's over easy. And gross!   I don't know if the cooks don't know how to properly prepare an over medium egg or if they're just in too much of a hurry to do it right. What is interesting is that I've found that the independent, little diners tend to get it right more often that the chains.   But the bacon and toast was excellent. The home fries were only so-so (dried out and over cooked). The coffee is also excellent, though a little high priced. And it would be much better if they served real half and half with the coffee instead of those little individual creamers.",

    "text": "On a Sunday morning, I wanted to go somewhere where they make me breakfast and I didn't really need to \"get cute\", just \"ready\". haha. I pulled up my yelp app and found First Watch. I put my hair in a ponytail, put on some jeans and a shirt and off we go...  When I got to the parking lot, we found a spot quickly - which means: not busy, no line, yes! We walk in and yup, it wasn't busy - empty tables everywhere. We were seated right away and our waitress was nice, but curt. I ordered the market hash with overmedium eggs. The market hash included seasoned potatoes, crimini mushrooms, zucchini, onions, red peppers, spinach, melted mozzarella and goat cheese. It was so freaken yummy! Once our food got to our table, we rarely saw our waitress.   Here's the problem: in the middle of us eating, the waitress drops off our check to have us pay up front. Right after that, the service practically stopped. We had to ask her for a to-go box and she didn't even refill our water cups. Once we got up to pay, we saw a long line of people waiting to check out. It was like waiting in line to buy the new iPhone 7! I'm exaggerating, but seriously - they should do this differently especially since they had empty tables and weren't too busy.I think it wouldn't hurt to have the waitress take our check with our card, refill our cups while we wait, and drop it to us. That small two minute process right there would've given her at least another $2-3 in tip. Instead, we waited in line for at least 10 minutes and paid.   The whole dining experience took about 40 minutes. I like that it was that quick and I didn't have to wait for a table, but I don't like the fact that you feel like you are just a number and once the check is dropped, on to the next. They are big and not as busy as let's say Matt's so let's bring back the customer service.  If I could rate just the food, I give it four stars. Service was two so overall, three stars.",

The combination of bacon, potatoes, avocadoes and other peppers worked perfectly.  Breakfast a lunch never tasted so good.  Also had the kale juice, and that was quite refreshing.

I must have it at least twice a month! Lemon juice adds an extra dimension, and get the soft scrambled eggs for best combo! The ham and cheese sandwich - croque madame if you please - blew me away! A rich sandwich for sure but loaded with flavor and herbs. Gruyere cheese and dijonnaise made it superb. Add the Kale Tonic -  Even if you don't like kale you will never know it is there.  This drink is refreshing and light and satisfying with the cucumber and apple flavors predominant.  The restaurant is VERY busy at lunch so go breakfast or late lunch.  The servers are very friendly and helpful and the restroom is kept clean even at the busiest time.    The menu is quite extensive and even though I have only tasted a few of the goodies, I have to say that it is a menu for all tastes.  If you want bacon and potatoes, it's there!  If you want vegan it's there and if you want vegetarian it's there!  All very fresh and mostly original.",

I would literally jump on a plane to go back to AZ and get one- bring it back to Cali. You NEED to try that.  Then I had the Salmon Fritata- Idk why I thought it was a salmon lox bagel- don't judge me. I had seen a picture, saw the word salmon and ordered it. It was really good!!! Its just the right portion (about the size of my palm) and it comes with a small salad. I would avoid the bread it comes with bc the butter was very salty.  I also ordered a wheat pancake bc why not? The banana crunch with added strawberries, and I would do it again. That pancake was probably the best pancake i've ever had.  I need another one with a Kale tonic and i would be a happy camper.

    "text": "First Watch is a local chain that serves up average breakfast food. This place isn't terrible, but it is also not remarkable in any way.  The booths are made of slotted wood, and for some reason they haven't been updated in years, resulting in sub-par seating that will leave horizontal lines on anyone wearing shorts.  The food is ok, not exciting or great, just ok. The coffee is bad, it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water. Additionally they don't have fresh half&half, they have the little individual cups similar to Circle K.  For this visit, the HUGE downfall was the service. I won't describe this person because I don't want any harm coming to her job, but if our server wasn't on meth, then I don't like cupcakes (HINT- I love cupcakes). The server was jittery, confused and racing around unnecessarily. Making things more annoying, the booth near us apparently had some of the servers friends dining, and they were so loud, I thought I was at a club. When we were seated the server yelled over to us asking us for a drink order. For the next ten minutes she sat with her pals and cackled about something they were watching on a smart phone.  It was sketchy too because they started talking pretty loudly about sex acts, and other things that aren't the best fit when there are tables of kids within five feet. I have a great sense of humor, but 11:00am on a Saturday isn't the best time to get cheeky at breakfast. In a different restaurant, they might politely ask the people who are yelling loudly and having inappropriate conversations to dial it down, but here the server was sitting with them, and was part of it.  Interestingly, all the other staff we encountered were very nice and appropriate, but our server was SO poor, that it just couldn't save the outing. Our food was brought to us by a lovely server who we wished would have been ours from the start. After our food was brought out, our server never stopped by again. It was funny however, that she had to walk by our table five times to go back and sit with her friends, and cackle some more- but couldn't stop to see if we needed more water (yes) Luckily my dining pal has a sense of humor and just rolled her eyes, but I would be livid if I brought my Mom, etc. there.  In closing, I cannot recommend this place for a meal. It's not terrible, but with the economy being so sketchy, it's nice to spend money somewhere that is comfortable and where you're not ignored, or served by someone who likely cannot pass a drug test.",

I was dashed to find out it wasn't True.  This is still my favorite First Watch location, and I thnk should be listed somewhere as \"Best place to choke on your ham\" or \"Best place to meet a single Dr.\"  or something because it's littered with hospital staff.  Not that there's anything wrong with that...  I love everything on the menu.  I love how fresh everything tastes and how healty it (almost) all seems.  I didn't realize the limits of the menu until I went there for breakfast with someone who doens't eat eggs.  Wow. There goes 90% of the menu.  Not that a breakfast/lunch place has to have tons of non-egg options, but if someone is looking for an alternative, it's pretty much just pancakes, or order something from the lunch menu.    Service has always been good, though rushed at times.  Wonder if any of these folks are just working here to meet the Dr's of their mother's dreams?  Could be interesting to find out...",

    "text": "First Watch is always a reliable place to hit after a night of binging or a moderate bout of dysentery, as you can always expect the food to be bland but healthful.  Barely anything on the menu is slathered in grease, which is a nice change from some of FW's competitors.  I'm not totally slamming the place: I actually like the combos they offer in terms of the sweet-savory equilibrium that's so important to me when breakfast is concerned.  The retirement home-style pastels are soothing, too.  You might expect Dorothy, Rose, and Blanche to sit down in the booth next to you at any moment.  A big FW plus is that generous seating ensures that there are barely any times when you have to wait to be seated for breakfast or lunch.  So if you can't get a seat at nearby Matt's Big Breakfast or the Park Central Good Egg, consider this egg joint.",

I have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why I don't come back here more often. Then I go and try some new trendy breakfast joint, only to realize I would have been better off coming back to First Watch instead. My personal favorite dish is the Chickichanga, but I've eaten half the stuff on the menu and it's all been really good.

    "text": "My coworkers don't want to go to First Watch anymore because they think it's too expensive.  They're right.  It no longer is a $ restaurant, it's a $$ restaurant.  You can't have a meal and a drink in there for less than $10.  That's for the cheapest choices.  Get something more expensive, or get a side, or a la carte, and you are easily in the $15+ range - for breakfast.  Get real, First Watch.  So for that kind of money I expect the best food and service and even some ambiance.  You'll get none of the above.  As others here say, things used to be better, and they are going downhill.  I have my theories which I will offer soon.  On a Tues at 10 am, the place maybe 50% full, I waited 10 mins after being seated to get a coffee.  The waitress kept disappearing for extended periods, making brief darting appearances into the dining room like a mouse carefully foraging at night.  The other tables were experiencing the same neglectful treatment, and people kept having to re-ask for water, coffee, juice, etc.    My food arrived, a $9 skillet, and it was bleh.  The potatoes were cold, the mushrooms were almost uncooked, and the ham was in tiny cubes, less than 5 mm in size, and stingy in portion.  The dish didn't taste seasoned, and it didn't taste cooked so much as microwaved.  The eggs were cooked well though.    Something that totally ticks me off about many breakfast places that First Watch does, is to not provide any combo breakfasts that include pancakes.  The only way to get them is as a head explodingly overpriced side - $3.39 for one pancake.  This is clearly in ripoff territory, and that's all that should be said about it, ripoff.  For $3.39, you might expect real maple syrup, but you will get synthetic syrup and margarine.  My pancake made of dollars was good, but again, when you pay this much money, your expectations are justifiably raised, and they weren't met.    My 3 coffee creamers were gone, and I couldn't get anybody's attention to get some more.  At one point my waitress went to another table near mine.  She looked at me and I looked at her to get her attention, and she just turned around and walked the other direction.  During my stay, the waitress was at my table 3x - once to seat me, once to take my order, and a 3rd time to bring my food.  I never saw her otherwise.  After I'd eaten, I still didn't have my check, so I walked up to the cashier. I encountered another waitress who was sniffing and rubbing her nose - not the most waitress-y thing to do in sight of your customers.  I was asked repeatedly how the food and service were, and I said it wasn't good.  They immediately tried to discount my bill (I refused).  But at the same time they wouldn't listen to me as I tried to explain what the specific shortcomings were, they just kept trying to give me freebies.  I cut the waitress off and said, \"I want you to listen to why I didn't like my meal, not to offer me comps.\"    Note that another reviewer mentioned that one of the waitresses was sweating.  I noticed another talking nonstop, and another one snuffling.  Make of it what you will.    Suggestions: --Reduce prices by at least 15% --Combo breakfasts that include a range of choices, including pancakes.  The menu is too rigid. --Reduce pancake prices by half.  Make them even cheaper if purchased as a side to another meal. --Quick beverage service. --More comfortable seating. --A policy to have wait staff checking on customers throughout the meal. --Random drug testing for waitstaff.  I think it would solve a lot of problems.",

    "text": "An old friend, and former employee, called me earlier in the week. He finally was able to find my correct contact information, and he wanted to catch up and to update me on how his life had progressed since we last saw each other - and he was still in my employ.  You'll notice that I often refer to former employees as friends, because ultimately that is who they are to me. I was simply their boss, but I was also a person dedicated to their ultimate success, as they helped me achieve my goals to further the companies that I have worked in. We were a team, and we were friend. Although I was also formal in my dealings, they never doubted my sincerity and candor regarding their careers. Except for a few I have had to fire over the years, the over 100 employees that I have had through various firms, have mostly stayed in touch.   This particular friend was a notable hire because of the many years that I have been doing interviews, he was my worst interviewee. At that time, he was working for a local television station, and he was completely unqualified for the position that I had posted.  He came in well dressed, but nervous. He sweated through the whole interview, had the worst answers, and the crumpled tissue he brought in to wipe the pouring sweat was now shredded into little pieces on the conference table.   But, I gave him an opportunity. And he turned out to be just great at his job!  Fast forward 16 years later, and my friend is now a C-Level executive at one of this state's agencies, and he is one of the highest non-elected officials. Although, he informs me that his bosses change with every new governor.  I ask him the ultimate question that I always ask, \"are you happy with the path you have chosen?\"  And everyone that I have asked so far that is my friend have always emphatically answered - Yes!   And they proceed to reminisce about our times working together, and their gratitude. I quickly dismiss this conversation, as I always attribute their success to their own efforts - period! I simply opened a door for them.  Now, on to how we wound up eating here.  I asked him where he wanted to eat, and he directed me to First Watch.  We were promptly greeted when we arrived, and our server, Christine was just a bundle of energy. She was just so cheerful and accommodating to our various needs and requests - just simply spot on!  My friend ordered the Skillet Hash, and I had the Smoked Salmon & Roasted Vegetable Frittata.  Apparently, my friend is a regular and he is familiar with this delightful dish. He had nothing but good things to say about it.  My Frittata was just wonderful. Not spectacular, but it made for a nice healthy and nutritious meal.   We were there longer than the average patron; he being the boss and I being on medical leave for the week, and yet throughout our entire stay, we were well cared for by Christine and her supporting staff.  We had a wonderful experience just catching up, talking about politics (yuck), technology (YAS!! What's the matter, too millennially urban for you?)  and how both our families have grown over the years.   If you are ever on this part of town, although you may have many dining options, I would strongly recommend this establishment.",

Nice little place inside.  I decided to order something different and decided on the BLT Benedict, which seemed like an interesting concept, using ciabatta instead of English muffins.  Plus I favor belly bacon more than ham or Canadian bacon as the meat.  The result was a little clunky and the construction was a little sloppy, but as long as it tasted OK, that can be forgiven.  However, it was surprisingly a little blah, but the biggie was that they committed the sin of serving an undercooked poached egg.  You know, the kind where the white is still translucent and runny.  I said nothing, ate around it and finished everything else (the potatoes on the side were fine), paid and left disappointed.  Honestly, if I had ordered something a little more conventional instead, I probably would have been relatively happy.  But this is the only data point I have to go on, so 2 stars it is.  Undercooked slimy eggs is a major no-no, IMHO.",

Rossi came over and sat us and also was our server. He was great! He tried upselling us two of the new juices but we were stuck in our way wanting an oj and apple juice. Oj was so good and so refreshing, so was the avocado toast (so basic I know). The granola pancakes were so good too, I love when restaurants put the fruit in the batter and that's just what they did with the blueberries. The biscuits and gravy were so so,the gravy was nothing to write home about. The best part of all was that Rossi was just on point with everything. He was the hostess, server and clearing tables. Just so on point with everything. He even brought out a small sample of the kale juice (can't remember the name) for us to try and could order next time. It was honestly so good, and so nice of him!",

    "text": "First time going here and I will definitely come back next time I am in Arizona. The worst part was that they only have 10 locations all in Arizona , (coming soon to Tennessee and Florida) however it is worth the trip!  They have fantastic service, staff and food!! They offer delicious breakfast creations both sweet and savory as well as yummy lunch options. And the prices are reasonable for the food you'll get, good portion meals from about $8-$12. They also have water and coffee waiting for you as soon as you're seated. On this trip I tried the following menu items that I highly recommend: AVOCADO TOAST:  This is a definite must try when you go, and proably something I'd get every visit. I have had homemade avocado toast before, but nothing like this. There toast is the perfect ratio of smashed avocado to thick cut whole grain toast and that drizzle of lemon and dash of salt, put it all together and it's magic in your mouth.  ELEVATED EGG SANDWHICH: A delicious upgrade on the classic egg sandwich. This sandwich contains cage-free eggs (cooked how you wish, I ordered it with scrambled and it was amazing), crispy bacon, Gruyere cheese, avocado, mayo and lemon dressed arugula on a brioche bun. Served with a side of potatoes. I would definitely get again.  LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES:  Due to all of the food we ordered, we decided to have wisdom and only order one, and it was the wrong choice. We should've ordered more. It contained lemon custard and fresh strawberries served on a ricotta pancake and every bit left me wanting more.  CHICKEN SALAD MELT & BUTTERNUT SQUASH BISQUE: For all those who like a more savory option, I recommend this item. Their chicken salad is made with rasians, apple, celery and a whole lot of love on grilled artisan whole grain toast topped with fresh tomato. The side bisque was amazing, creamy, sweet and delicious. MAPLE BACON:  We ordered a side of bacon drizzled with maple syrup and although it was the least satisfying thing I tried, it was still great. So if you want sweet and savory all in one this is for you.  Kids meals a good size portions and just as delicious. (Try the Grilled Cheese and fresh fruit)",

Best Breakfast place in Phoenix , I have had the pleasure of being served in.   First thing which everyone must try, the hot chocolate , the best way to start your (in my case) late morning. So good and they give you a decent size mug to enjoy this drink . Now the amount of food you get is enough to cover a few meals in your day which is a big bonus. But the winning prize goes to the flexibility of the menu and the staff. I do not eat pork and if you are the type to want some meat in your omelette its hard to choose something off the menu without pork in it. First watch has plenty of substitute options and they do not count pennies on the ingredients, they stack it up.  I believe I purchased the avocado omelette and a two pancake side. The omelette, I asked if I could sub in some turkey sausage and they delivered . the plate was packed with potato , omelette and English muffin. Now the pancakes, o my was the cherry on top, best pancakes out there. Fluffy , filling and man it actually warms my heart knowing there is someone out there , who took the time to deliver those stacks.   Overall great restaurant , friendly staff , whoever the owners are bravo , open up a First Watch next door to me cause I will be there everyday . also my bill was about 30 dollars for myself and my girlfriend to order breakfast with coffee and 2 hot chocolates so its not over priced and I would of paid more for that meal.",

Their toast was buttered and melting when it got to me. The bread was a thick whole wheat. The strawberry jam that came with it was very very delicious and sweet. My omelette, 'The Works', was really good.  It had a lot of adds ins but somehow they all worked really well.  The tomatoes tasted very fresh. I'm not sure how much I enjoyed the sour cream on top but honestly that was so trivial compared to how good everything else was. I got the potatoes instead of the side salad and those were flavored really well. You could eat them plain or with ketchup. They also gave me a large jug of cold water that was very refreshing. Also the staff was just fantastic! At least 3 staff members came up to me and made sure I was alright. I could tell that they wanted me to have a great time. Their service was remarkable and they were really going above and beyond! I'm definitely going to look for one of these in Michigan when I get home.",

Their offerings seem to be pretencous versions of the standard fare one might expect, but expectations fall far short of being superior to the originals. Biscuits and gravy with turkey sausage? Bacon that looks like something you find at a Denny's? Pressed ham? Syrup served in a glass decanter, but tastes like log cabin? Breakfast potatoes that looked to be baked, lacking anything resembling a crust? I  don't understand the hype, the price or the ratings. This place is highly overrated, if your not looking for avacado toast it's probably better to look elsewhere.",

The omelet was flat and I believe they neglected to add in the turkey. The whole grain toast was nothing to rave about and it came with about 4 pieces of cut up fruit in a very small cup. For the price paid, I do not believe it was worth the value.   We are from Las Vegas where there are an abundance of good local breakfast places where you definitely get what you paid for. We are healthy eaters, but not bird eaters and the portions were small and the taste of the omelet was very bland.   It seems a hot spot for the Phoenix locals, but come to Vegas where you surely will not be disappointed! I will be more than happy to suggest some great breakfast eateries which have the same type of clean and healthy breakfasts, at a lower price but chockfull of flavor!",

    "text": "Caught up with breakfast at First Watch, after a trip to Illinois, on my way home to Cornville. I usually use Yelp when in unfamiliar territory. I chose this restaurant for convenience to the Interstate, & in desperation for food before the 2 hour drive north, but still wanting something special. Admittedly it was Sunday morning. I'm guessing a pretty busy day, overall. We were sat quickly, at a small 2-top. Okay, I can cope with less room. I'm pretty malleable & calm, in public social situations, if I'm in a good mood ;o) , which is usually.  Coffee is good, and you get your own pot. Also a beaker of water, which I really appreciate. Plus, as wait staff, why keep checking on people's water when you're already busy? Quarters seem tight in this restaurant to me, but that's okay. It's personal. On to the fare: I ordered the regular breakfast, with ham. Actually I changed my mind about the ham, and told server, \"Make that bacon crispy, instead.\" Ham came. I like ham; this particular ham unfortunately, did not meet my expectation. Tasted my buddies' bacon, and it was weird somehow. Like plastic bacon. I can be fussy. Potatoes were excellently seasoned. I'm avoiding many potatoes these days, so was sorry I had to leave some behind as left-overs. The toast! Yum! And the preserves were very good also. Unfortunately there was another miscommunication about my eggs. I like medium to medium well, soft yolk, no slime, and preferably not burned around the edge.. The server asked, \"You want the yolk hard?\" I said, \"No.\" Yolk was hard, etc. Why have that great toast, without a wonderful soft yolk in which to dunk it? Disappointing breakfast. Yes. I was too tired and too hungry to send it back for replacement. Life's too short. Going with the flow...",

The restaurant looked and smelled extremely clean. That's the first thing I noticed. We were seated at our table and given a new chilled drink the call a Pomegranate Mule. It contains pomegranate, ginger and lemon a wedge poured over ice. It was crisp and refreshing. The first entree they presented was the Truffled Wild Mushroom Frittata. It was very good. They had scoop of garlic cream on top of it which added to the flavor. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but Emma ate them all and they were great. I'll definitely take her word for it. The second entree was the Heritage Pork Chop and Eggs with house made compote and a side of cheddar grits. I thought the pork chop was the highlight of the evening. It was top quality pork and was prepared perfect.....great job. The cheddar grits tasted great, a wonderful accompaniment. The final entree was their pumpkin pancakes with scrambled eggs and a chicken sausage patty. They did a great job on the pancakes. They were prepared just right and tasted super good. If there was anything negative to the meal its was the chicken sausage patty. I didn't care for the taste nor the texture. I would not order it in the future. Overall a great evening. I would definitely recommend First Watch and look forward to our next visit there",

With lots to choose from.including lots of healthy choices too. The coffee. Hmm I wasn't always loving their coffee.  Never had a bad visit. Wait staff always friendly from hostess to manager. Really a pleasant experience.  Busy every day but weekends are busiest. Parking is easy they have own private car park.  Easy to get to. Even if you don't have a car. Take the Light Rail to Thomas and Central. Walk West on Thomas Rd. Which is the avenues First Watch is on the south  side of the street. Perhaps a 5 minute walk from Central Ave.",

    "text": "Love this location for First Watch. For starters it has been here as long as I can remember. Secondly , I love the food! It is always fresh and hot. The service is wonderful as well. 3 of us came for lunch recently. About 1:20pm. Close to closing ,as they only serve Breakfast and Lunch here. Even though ,they seated us in a section they had already closed,(because, my friend wanted to seat there). I thought that was very nice of them. Our service was great and so was our food. Remember if you sign up on line at their website , they will give you coupons via email. Even a free meal for your Birthday. Parking can at times be a little tricky but, you should always be able to find something. Restrooms are always clean.",

Our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  She introduced herself as \"Lindsay\", and I am sure she is not the \"Milkoholic Lindsay\" from the E-Trade commercial.  She did a great job for us.  Our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty.  Lindsay checked on us quite a few times as we ate and refreshed our drinks.

I had a visitor in town who wanted breakfast so we decided on this place rather than attempting to wait it out at Matt's.  I was pleasantly surprised that they have a whole section of healthy choices!  Another reason that I'm not a huge fan of breakfast is because it always seems to be about a million totally unhealthy options.  First Watch calmed my fears of having a way too high in calorie breakfast.  They had a whole section of their menu that had healthy options on it!  I'm a fan of that.  I ordered the power wrap which had some great veggies, turkey and egg whites wrapped in a spinach tortilla.  The mushrooms were amazing!  It was served with a very modest side of fruit and salsa.  My dining companion used to be a regular at this place so he had a whole slew of things on the menu he had ordered previously.  He got the chickichanga and was happy with it.  I enjoy the name of some of their menu items.  Chickichanga, chickichanga, how fun!  Our service was efficient.  I asked our waitress about some of the options in the healthy stuff section on the menu and her reaction was funny.  She told me that if you like 'that kind of stuff' the power wrap was probably the way to go.  Despite the healthy section of the menu, I guess some of the staff aren't down with it.  Amusing.    Despite not being a breakfast person, it's good to know that First Watch has some options that won't leave you feeling guilty all day about breakfast indulgence.",

Seats are basic wooden booths and the inside seems a bit cooler and darker than you'd expect for a bright Phoenix morning.   The menu is basic breakfast fare and I had a version of the Denver omelette with english muffins on the side. There was also a potato side that came with it: for the life of me, I believe it was homefries, but I'm not 100%. Obviously it wasn't too memorable, but I thought everything here was at least average.  Prices were reasonable and they dropped a coffee canteen at my table (and even refilled it when I had drank the whole thing) for easy access.   So, not a meal that you'll remember for the rest of your life, but there won't be any nightmares here either......",

Chocolate chip pancakes, and a side of ham and an egg. The pancake was a little dry but the ham was pretty good. Coffee was average, eggs were average. But they did have some decent things on the menu. I do like that they brought out an entire carafe of coffee, and water so I don't get stuck paying 2 bucks for a tiny cup-o-joe w/ no refill, or trying to flag someone down for one. Nice! But our server was great. She apologized for the OJ spilled all down the side of her previous to our visit. It did look bad though. lol. When I went to pay they were the guy asked me how everything was and what I had planned today. I sincerely appreciate people who enjoy their job, and make your experience enjoyable.

I was rather impressed that it was a healthy alternative to your average breakfast at Denny's or International House of Pancakes.  One of the first things I noticed when I walked in was that every table had their own pitcher of ice water ready for the customers to pour.  Don't get me wrong, while this was great since I was able to easily quench my thirst, I thought it was odd that for a state that's extremely conscious about water preservation, they could do this.  Fortunately I used some of the water our table couldn't finish by filling my empty water bottle.  ;b  Oh yeah, forgot to mention one really cool thing I like about this place is that when you get the check, it has the person's order and drinks AND tax summed up as Person 1, Person 2 , etc.  Plus a big lump sum at the bottom.  They really need to do that at ALL restaurants!!!  :D  Overall, the service was pleasant and prompt.  Unfortunately, I forgot the name of the tomato basil wrap dish I ordered, and while it was healthy delicious (tomato basil wrap, egg white, cheese, spinach, and smoked turkey... and side fruit), I was disappointed that the basil taste wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be.  My boyfriend also wasn't satisfied with his Chorizo Burrito.  So... 3 stars.",

For example, I had the sockeye salmon eggs Benedict, which were served on ciabatta rather than English muffin. Very good.

    "text": "Frankly when I Yelped first watch and saw all the 5/5 star reviews I was VERY confused. It has a very average updated diner vibe (think Denny's with a bit of class).  I went this morning around 10:30 and I have to say I won't be back any time soon.  PROS:  VERY good service, the waitress was very attentive and happy to bring us whatever we needed.  Easy to find, right off of Thomas a crossed from the hospital. Plenty of parking. Good prices, about 8-10$ per entree. Nice sized portions as well.   CONS: Let me first say that the coffee was not good. I am an avid coffee drinking but by no means am I a coffee \"snob\". Im not sure what was up with this coffee but it was so bitter it felt like it was coating my teeth and mouth to the point that I could no longer drink it.  However, for the record I did not ask for a new cup and Im quite sure that with 5/5 stars not all their coffee could taste this way.   The food was (as my grandmother would say) nothing to write home about.  I got the biscuits and turkey sausage gravy (came with a side of potatoes and eggs of your choice-I got poached).  The eggs were sitting in a little bowl with a small collection of water at the bottom (they were cooked perfectly though). The gravy and potatoes were good.  However, the advertised the biscuits as being homemade and they were rather dry.  While I'd give the service a 5/5, I'd have to give the food a 2.5/5.  With all the great breakfast and brunch spots around the Valley I wouldn't bother wasting your time or money at First Watch : |",

    "text": "Today I had the opportunity to go to first watch for lunch I really enjoy their food it's a relatively busy place especially at lunch. But today was a terrible experience. I walked in to the restaurant and there was nobody at the front for about a minute. A young girl walks up and sits down a couple and I have yet to be acknowledged. Another group of people walks in and she proceeds to see them down. After sitting The second group she finally says to me I'll be right with you. After she says that to me she continues to go grab Some menus from behind the desk and sit down a few more people that were there before I was. And then a woman comes up to the front because she thought the Waitress was going to take her check and said she really had to go so the young lady proceeded to get her checked out still without getting back to me after she said she would be right with me. As I continue wait for about 7 to 8 minutes a group of three people walked in the young lady  asked them how many need to be seated? At this point I had to leave the restaurant because it was just very upsetting and unprofessional the way she was going about handling things I don't know if she forgot about me or didn't see me standing right in front of her face for 7minutes. I hope this location can get a little better organized so nobody else has a terrible experience like i did today. Thanks",

I especially like that they have a bunch of different flavored creamers.  The staff is very friendly and efficient. You can tell this is the type of place that has regulars. I also like that they have both breakfast and lunch items to choose from.  I had the Key West Crepe egg. The crepe egg is a mixture between a thin crepe and whipped eggs and it was stuffed with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and probably some other goodies. It came with hash browns and an english muffin. My husband had the traditional breakfast which is pretty much what it sounds like. Overall I would recommend First Watch because it's a great breakfast at a good price with friendly staff.",

Waffles and pancakes taste fresh and fluffy, and helps with the depression of being in Downtown Phoenix. The staff is always great--feels like a folksy 1950's movie because they're mostly moms who ply on the coffee and food and tell you to eat your veggies.",

    "text": "A coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when I offered to treat. And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it.   The inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a \"Good Day Sunshine\" breakfast vibe.  We sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has \"The Healthier Side\" - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch.   The coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal.   The birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out.   Overall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better.   If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger.",

I personally love that! Upside down baskets for lampshades, farm doors used as accents, very clean decor. The menu is also taken a major on a makeover. A lot of healthy conscious choices, and some items I'd call eccentric. I went with a classic, 3 egg with chicken sausage(pretty cool), white toast and country potatoes. Awesome! And now that I'm intrigued I'll definitely be going back to expand upon this updated, upgraded gem!",

My avocado toast dish was excellently prepared--my guess is the avocado was mixed with salt, lemon & perhaps additional seasoning for a terrific taste, the eggs perfectly basted over medium. My husband had the belgian waffle trifecta (eggs & bacon). Rarely is a restaurant waffle cooked as well as this. Next time in Phoenix, I will make First Watch one of my first stops!!",

The meal started with a pomegranate mule that was very refreshing and well balanced between the line, ginger and pomegranate. The first course was a truffled wild mushroom frittata. The truffle flavor was present without being overwhelming and the toast was delicious as well. Nice and crispy, buttery and complimented the flavors of the frittata well. Next we had the heritage pork chops and eggs. A bone in pork chop with an apple compote accompanied by eggs and grits. This was my least favorite meal of the night, I am not a grits fan and it was further confirmed that night. The dish definitely needed a carb to balance the protein but grits would not be my choice. The flavors of the dish actually reminded me of thanksgiving leftovers which was interesting. I did enjoy the apple compote tho, that was a nice addition to the pork chop. Finally, we had the pumpkin pancake breakfast which was surprisingly good. Unpopular opinion warning! I am not a huge pumpkin spice fan, but the way they prepared their pancakes was perfect. Moist, flavorful and delicious. I wouldn't mind going back for more of those!  The chicken sausage patty was actually pretty good too, I wasn't expecting that based off of appearance alone. Overall, it was a solid breakfast for dinner event and it made me rethink my dislike for pumpkin spice!",

We asked what the deal was and a different greeter asked the original greeter if the hold was off and she said yes. Didn't even acknowledge that she left us standing there. The rest of the experience was good but we were so peeved by the terrible initial service and lack of apology that the review is what it is. We arrive at noon when it's not as busy for a reason - I would hate to see how such a flighty host handles the busy hours.",

Brooke got biscuits with turkey sausage, gravy with eggs x potatoes on the side a coke. WITH a muffin of the day (blueberry). No complaints everything was delicious. Atmosphere was great we sat outside and enjoyed people watching. Bathrooms had a good vibe very clean with up beat but calm music. 3 days later we got the check.",

It's not what I would call fancy or gourmet but it's that kind of place that you know you and your group is not going to be disappointed.  We have been there a couple of times and there is always a wait but never too long and it is always worth it!  The HASH breakfast's are my personal favorite and everything about them tastes 100% homemade.  If you are one of those who really likes hash but asks if it's canned because you don't like the kinda salty mushed stuff with little tiny chopped potatoes,  Well you are going to LOVE this place because it is truly homemade and well portioned and full bodied with great flavor!  There is always more than enough food to go around; we are big boys and like to eat and start our vacation days with good food for breakfast and have never been disappointed here.  When ever in Phoenix I think we eat here at least once..... we always try new places because we are adventurous but First Watch is the place that comes to mind if there is any question or if you've had a bad meal you always think, I should have just eaten there....  I would also say they are the masters of comfort food!  Good food time and again that you can count on.  Thank you!!!",

They don't even bat an eye at special requests. No matter what size group we end up having, the servers and the kitchen both cope well, too, which is always rad.

You'll have plenty of room in their booths whether you're dining alone with your work-papers all spread out, or sitting with others. Noise level is perfect for having a meeting over a meal. First Watch servers are first-rate pros, a perfect balance of down-to-business attention accompanied by a friendly smile but without the overlay of fake and distracting, cutesy chitchat.

Oh my goodness you might as well order a side of fried onions. I was pulling out huge chunks of onion and the intense flavor of onion was impossible to make with ketchup or hot sauce. And apparently they are completely unable to make a side of potatoes without onions because they're pre mixed together. They were atrocious.",

    "text": "Received a neighborhood flyer to check out this wonderful cafe. Party of two. First glance of the cafe was inviting. Thursday afternoon, moderately busy. Host greeted us with in two minutes and seated at a table for two. Host took our drink order (Ice tea and Large Orange Juice). Our waitress brought out our beverages. While we still needed a few moments to decide what to order, our waitress said she would return in a few moments. Cool. Five minutes later we were ready but the waitress must have been busy. We waited patiently for 15 minutes before she returned. Beverages needed refills because we were there about 20 minutes in. Ice Tea was refilled but I was not asked about my Orange Juice. Our order came out shortly after brought out by a different waitress that as I observed to be extra help by delivering food and picking up plates. She asked if we needed anything else and I replied yes. A glass of water. Since my Orange Juice was nearly consumed. Presentation at first glance was great. Roast beef and Habarti side of soup and a Chicken Salad melt open faced side of salad and bacon. Yummy! We started to eat our meals and flavor was there. Perfect. Thank you Chef! Halfway eating our meals I needed that Glass of water which never was brought. Luckily our first waitress came to check on us and noticed I was out of my beverage and asked if I would like a water. I replied yes but didn't mention I requested it earlier and was never delivered. Water was brought out a few minutes later. Men's Bathroom appearance was ok. Urinal needs some attention. Separating from the wall. Stall was in the same condition. Paper on the floor and nearly out of TP. Lol happy I didn't need to use the stall today or I'd be in a $h!)y situation. Ha ha but overall giving my first experience a three star thumbs up. Areas that need work is speed of service and Attention to detail on the customers table. And a little TLC in the men room.",

We ordered the: healthy Turkey (egg whites, Turkey, feta, onions, tomatoes, onion) with wheat bread. Elevated egg sandwich with potatoes. I also ordered the Kale Tonic!  I've never had something like this but it sounds intriguing, so let's do it.  Kale tonic is super good & full of refreshing flavor. Plus it makes me feel like healthy.  Plenty of parking.",

Immediate seating, a broad menu with healthy options, comfy booths to accommodate a group, and fast delivery of our meals.   The service was a bit spacey. For example, there are non-dairy coffee creamers on the table but I was hoping for some real dairy for my coffee. I asked the server for milk for the coffee and she pointed at the creamers and so I said again, cream or milk? And she offered that they had \"only\" half and half. Uh, yeah. That's what I mean. Anyhoo a couple other random bobbles, but otherwise a pleasant visit. My omelette was tasty and the bread that came with it was hearty and delicious.   The pancakes looked amazing and they have a kids menu too which was great for the little ones in our party.",

The grits....Nah!  Lacked the butter and milk, pretty thick (but the cheese melted on top nicely).  I would visit again, but now I know what to get and what to stay away from.

How it went:   - It started with a drink of pomegranate \"mule.\" It tasted like it was freshly squeezed. I nursed it all evening while they brought out...  - Truffled wild mushroom frittata. Not bad! The fresh fruit and the  ciabatta toast made for interesting side dishes.  - Next we had a heritage pork chop and eggs. I don't like my eggs runny but ok. The housemade apple compote topping on the pork chop was an added plus. I almost wanted add sugar to the cheddar grits but it was delicious without it.  - \"A pancake by any other name is still...a pancake.\" My thoughts when served the pumpkin pancake, as I added (I think it was) maple syrup to the mix...which only added to the sweet taste. The sausage patty looked special but tasted average.   We enjoyed our meal with another fellow Yelper and her +1, whom we were seated at the same booth with. The servers were both friendly and accommodating; I didn't feel any \"we gotta do this because of an Elite event\" vibe from them.    Looking at the other Yelpers sitting at nearby tables, it seemed most were enjoying the meal. We left a donation for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, picked up some coupons and left.      I wouldn't drive all the way from Yuma to eat here again, but if we lived in the area, I'd consider it.  Thanks again, Yelp Elite!",

I'm sure there's a wait later in the morning! My husband loved the sausages that came with the traditional breakfast. He is English, and the sausage resembled what he would get in England. That's always a plus! If we visit this area again, I'm sure we'll stop in again for the yummy breakfast.",

    "text": "If you are familiar with the First Watch franchise then you know that this place serves up delicious traditional breakfast/lunch options with a health conscious effort in mind. Delicious omelets, soups, sandwiches, salads, coffee, and juice. The hot coffee is excellent, no bitter taste, and their cold brew coffee is just as good, though pricey at $3.99 for 1 glass.    It is a lot smaller than other locations I've been to, as I frequent the much larger location in West Mesa. Both are consistent in quality and friendly, quick service. Free WiFi makes it a good place to sit in a comfy booth and do work from a laptop. The atmosphere is relaxed, laid back and decor is a trendy industrialized farmhouse style. The location is very close to St. Joe's hospital (literally across the street). Parking is decent (wasn't crowded at all). There is outdoor seating, but no misting system or significant shade, so I would not recommend sitting outside in the brutal summer heat.  All in all, it is a cute and clean cafe to relax, eat a meal, and drink a solid \"no-frill\" cup of coffee.",

Actually, scratch that. The long wait at another breakfast place and the fact that First Watch had NoWait on it's page definitely helped.   Getting back to what matters, this place is the cutest! It's super trendy, but also gave me farm-house vibes. It made me think of Chip & Jo Gaines on their more modern projects. The staff was super nice and welcoming, and our waiter was really helpful and knowledgeable with menu items.   The food...If my photos don't speak for themselves, let me spell it out. AB-SO-LUTE-LY DE-LI-CIOUS.   We ordered iced coffee (bit sweeter than normal, but I love that), Eggs Benedict, Tri-Fecta, Million Dollar Bacon and a side of potatoes. There was not a single thing wrong with any of it. They even gave me a bottle of syrup for my waffle! For someone who likes her waffle/pancakes swimming comfortable in a sea of syrup, you can understand how that's much better than the little shot-glass looking containers.   Oh and the cost for all these wonderful things you ask? Between two people, it was not even $18 (before tip)!   Yeah, I know. You probably didn't even get to the price part because you're already on your way there. Proud of you.",

Overall, we had a great evening, got to try a lot of delicious and interesting breakfast plates, and benefited a great charity. It was a win-win-win and we can't wait to stop by again!  Pomegranate mule - So refreshing! We had an alcohol-free version, but I imagine even with it would pair nicely with the fruity sweetness. The ginger was very present without being overpowering; I finished mine pretty quickly :)   Truffled wild mushroom frittata - I admittedly had no idea what a frittata was lol but this ended up being one of my favorite dishes. It was essentially a mixed omelet with shitake and crimini mushrooms, shallots, and arugula. AND the garlic and herb butter was amazing!!! It had that warm, buttery, garlic taste that made the entire dish aromatic and savory. You could put it on anything and it would be delicious haha  Heritage pork chop and eggs - The name is a bit misleading; this is ham! Probably the thickest slice of ham I've ever had and it was v tender and tasty (though how can you go wrong with ham??) I loved that it was bone-in and had very little fat on it. If you're really hungry, I'd go for this one!  Pumpkin pancake breakfast - These pancakes tasted like autumn! They were fluffy, warm, and spiced perfectly; the smell alone reminded me so much of the holidays, so it was a very nostalgic dish. The dish is served with warm syrup, scrambled eggs, and chicken sausage. The chicken sausage was great too! It's one of my favorite breakfast meats and they nailed it!  If I could build my perfect breakfast, I'd have the pumpkin pancakes, mushroom frittata (with a pound of garlic butter), chicken sausage, and the pomegranate mule to wash it all down :) Yum!",

    "text": "My wife and I have been here a few times, now, and it's a consistent go-to spot for a late or working breakfast.   My first time, I got a seasonal pork chop dish - it was okay, but I wasn't impressed.   My second time, I wanted to be sure to order a popular dish to gauge how much I liked this spot. It needed some redeeming. I got the breakfast tacos, and was pleasantly surprised. I was worried it'd be bland, or watery, or not filling enough. I was wrong on all counts. Super flavorful, fun colors and textures. Very filling, even with the fruit on the side instead of the beans.   Our third time, I got the avocado toast and I didn't like it. The avocado was spotty - so I'd get a bite and half of it would be rich and creamy, and the other would have the texture of, well, unripe avocado. It was way too lemon-y and salty - maybe to cover up the undesirable avocado. I don't blame them - it's a fickle fruit, but the dish was pricey and didn't have any substance to it.   The last time we were here, I got the banana granola pancakes, and they were bomb. So much flavor, super moist, not too heavy, so satisfying.   We like getting the granola to go here - makes for a great snack or breakfast throughout the week.   The service here is pretty good - you're checked on just enough, and you're given some space, but everything is clean and timely.",

    "text": "First Watch brings a nice change of pace to the usual slate of breakfast and brunch chain restaurants found around the valley. Centrally located in downtown Phoenix, First Watch makes for a great space to eat and hang out!  Don't let the exterior fool you, it may look small and tidy from the outside, but inside, there's plenty of seating, and a short wait to get seated and going with your meal. As someone who loves variety and trying out new things, one thing I love about First Watch is their seasonal menu, which always includes fun and unique items such as the butternut squash bisque and pomegranate mule. On my visit, I ordered the biscuits with turkey sausage gravy, which also came with eggs and potatoes. Their biscuits were fresh and warm, and the gravy was rather addictive, but I found the potatoes to be kind of dry and flavorless. Overall, I found First Watch's service and atmosphere to be top-tier, but their food a little lacking. Their menu offers a variety of different items, so maybe I'll give it another chance!",

My over-easy eggs, sliced avocados & potatoes were probably the only thing fresh. Oh, and the pico de gallo was pretty good. So overall it was alright for the amount of serving you get & $. If you're starving it'll fill you up. Most likely won't visit again. Husband said it was bland but did the job (after adding salt, pepper & hot sauce) since he was starving.  Apart from the food, the service surpassed the food! :)",

    "text": "We had breakfast at first watch, Thomas road, recently. My husband ordered french toast for $9.00 and was appalled that he got no meat with it. It was two barely egged pieces of bread..very disappointing. Not even potatoes, or a little fruit. Just two pieces of bread. He was mad. I got the traditional two eggs scrambled. My eggs were maybe three tablespoons of egg which at my house would have been the equivalent of one small egg. My potatoes were basically a baked potato cut up with nothing on it, completely flavorless. No crispness what so ever and dry as a bone. Today, at home, I made two breakfasts of whole wheat french toast (very easy my friends), with butter and syrup and bacon and yummy french roast quality coffee and we calculated the two breakfasts cost about a total of $5.00 (I got 18 large eggs on sale for $1.29). My point is this: if a restaurant is going to offer something that anyone can make for a fraction of the price, don't you think it would be a good idea to give them something really special, especially if your charging about $30.00 for two people, out the door? ......Ok, didn't take up offer of free food because I'm not looking for free food, I'm looking for good food and at a good value. So we just went again because we got a two for one coupon in the mail, and I had the sweet pecan chicken salad...for breakfast. It's very good. I guess you just have to know what to order. Changing my two stars to three.",

I must confess, no matter what time I've been, I always have breakfast, so that's all I can review :D My favorite omelet is new on their menu, the Ce La Vie. It's  roasted zucchini, onions and tomatoes with herbed goat cheese. It comes with just the right amount of potatoes and an english muffin. I always switch out the muffin for wheat toast.  When I'm ravenous & I want something a little heavier, I like the bacon and onion hash.    The staff is always so friendly & our waitress always remembers us, even when she's not our waitress :)",

Like many other businesses do when they are concerned with profit the establishment appeared understaffed. The waitress seemed hurried, and it took a while to get coffee, we never received any water and when our food arrived it was cold. Great location , tasty food, simply understaffed. My opinion as a business owner make customer service #1 priority. Put on enough people to properly and promptly, seat people, take their orders, deliver their orders as soon as they come up , and clear the dirty tables to start the process all over again. What it costs you in labor you will benefit 10 fold in comments and satisfaction. In addition the servers will garner higher tips.",

We recently dined here for the first time ordering off the lunch menu... and found out they serve breakfast and lunch all the time! Awesome!  All of our visits here have resulted in great service and a satisfying meal. Something as simple as a great tasting carafe of water, and delicious coffee with flavored creamers available at the table. The food has always been great as well.  I usually order lighter options such as avocado toast (highly recommend)  or the BLTE... a ton of bacon on Multigrain bread with spring mix, tomatoes, and an over hard egg. Yummy!   Recently they remodeled and the place now has a fun farmhouse feel to it. It's a great spot to catch up over coffee.",

Both were good and we cleared out plates, sipping on the coffee (caution: it's a strong brew) to wrap up our casual Saturday breakfast.

Their website and ads boast about 'healthy' choices... when truly, they are not very healthy at all. The lowest calorie plate was 550 calories and comes with sugar jelly and the veggies in the egg white omelet were soaked in oil. Not to mention, the plate looked like something premade, heated, and then tossed on the plate. When we were finished with our meal, before we had walked halfway home, both of our bellies were grumbling and upset. The food did not settle well at all. We will not be visiting a second time.",

I ordered a crepe with fruit and yogurt for my son which was brought out first and I appreciated. For myself I ordered a smoked salmon Benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon was delicious! the bread had a nice crunch to it but wasn't too hard and the potatoes were amazing. I also ordered one of their fresh juices (can't remember the name of it now). It had carrot and ginger and some other ingredients which I can't remember but it was amazing!

Yes, if there were nothing else to pique my interest to try and to review, that was close by, I'd go again to see if it's different from this experience (not that it was a bad experience). Would I run back if there were other places close by that I had not been? Not right away. But, If I wanted a good standby restaurant with decent food, a decent atmosphere, good service where I wasn't expecting to be blown away, ya, I'd stop in again.",

    "text": "This used to be my fave place. The omelets choices were all stellar. I met two friends here last weekend and we were all disappointed. I will be very detailed here as to why in the hopes they will fix it. First of all, the bacon in/on the bacado used to be crunchy, fresh and plentiful. This time, a few soggy pieces scattered. The cheese is different, I know they know the difference but the freshly grated mix was better. And almost no avocado. This for a rather expensive omelet. My friend got the scramble and said the same, just not special. Service was also not like it used to be. It seems they have gotten tired and complacent here and need to get their fire back. Seeing I used to meet friends here every weekend, I am hoping they will have a talk with the cooks there to bring it back to its former self.",

The salad it came with was so fresh and had a refreshing, light lemon vinaigrette which was clearer made in house. The hollandaise sauce had a light and lemony flavor that complimented the salad perfectly. My husband ordered the BLTE sandwich and while I didn't try it, he loved it! The grain artisan bread looked great and it was a healthier breakfast sandwich option. For kids, they have a great selection. The two things that knocked them down from 5 stars to 4 is that it is pricier than our favorite breakfast spot downtown and they don't serve alcohol. Overall though, service was great and the food was good!",

Inside the place was busy but not overly busy. We were seated right away. Decor inside was nothing to really speak of but the food is the main attraction here. I had the \"not guilty your honor\" a fabulous choice. It came with a bowl of soup, today's soup was Italian wedding ball. The soup was so close to my grandmothers it was scary. Yes, it's 108 degrees outside but it was so good I had to eat every drop. The wrap was moist, fresh and super tasty. It was enough to fill me but not leaving you with that over stuffed feeling. From other dishes that were walking by and pics I've seen here, I most definitely will be back and I will tell others this IS the spot for lunch. Sadly it's too far from me to experience breakfast.",
