    "text": "Another place I am lucky to live across the street from.  It's been 2 years since I have lived in Japan.  I just moved here a few months ago from Sacramento/San Fran area and this is the first Japanese restaurant that brings me back to Japan.  That's a bold statement.  The okonomiyaki is a dish you get in Osaka, Japan, and this is delicious!  Do not accept other substitutes and take it from me, this is how the dish should be done. Another favorite that everyone seems to rave about is the pork belly sticky buns.  Had to try them and now you should to.  Deee-light-ful!  Pork fat rules for you fat free sissies! My favorite by far though is the oyster and uni shot.  I also have not had uni this fresh since Japan!  Uni(sea urchin) should not be served more than three days old, there is a huge difference, and this why a lot of people do not like uni.  This uni was buttery and melted in my mouth like it should.  What a perfect combination for fresh oyster lovers. Next time we will sit at the bar and get to know Nobuo-san, maybe bring him some habu sake! As far as the price, well don't expect a typical Americanized Asian food buffet deal.  This is a place you come for a dining experience, to really get a small taste of savory Japanese cuisine. To the next drink here, Kampai(com-pie)!  To the next great meal, Itadakimasu(ee-tah-dah-kee-mahs)!",

    "text": "oh man... the wife and i have been dying to try this place since it opened on the recommendation of a good foodie friend of ours, and it did not disappoint one tiny bit.  first off is the setting, in a historic house in heritage square. you get a welcome feeling because of the layout even though it's definitely not styled like an old home inside. the hostess/food runner was pleasant, and nobuo himself brought a couple of dishes to our table and came by to make sure we had everything we needed.  the reason we came here was the okonomiyaki, and it deserves it's reputation. i've had this dish before at other restaurants but it was never this good! we also tried the ebi salad and the short rib steamed buns, and the barley tea. everything went well together, was delicious, and probably ranks as one of the best lunches we've ever had.  we will definitely be back, and with friends in tow... we can't wait to try out the dinner menu!",

It usually ranges from $100-150 per person, depending on the day or season, right now its about $135.

Each item we ordered was delicious and an adventure for the palate.  Very fresh, interesting, and fun to talk about.  However, delicious food is not everything.  When we left this place something was not right....oh yeah, we were still hungry.  Wait a sec, I just paid over 100 for food and I'm still hungry!?  That's no good!  The waiter suggested 3-6 plates to share for 2 people depending on how hungry we were.  We ordered 6....can't image if we had gone with 3.  So keep in mind that the portions here are small-medium, and very few dishes have a starch.    OK, so with that I might say I'd still come back...but there was something else off with this place.  We didn't find the staff very friendly.  It seemed to me that they were very professional and attentive...but just not friendly.  I know some restaurants are just more that way...but I personally enjoy those where the staff greets you with a smile and takes a minute to chat.  Here, everyone just seemed to be stressed out...running around...down to business.  I don't know...Bianco next door is way busier, yet they are friendly and attentive.  Despite the outstanding food...we will probably not go back.  Just not our kinda place...",

We went here on a Sunday after a visit to a downtown church, and apparently we are the only people who immediately felt after prayer that what we need on a mid-day on Sunday are some cocktails and some amazing food.  No one was there at all.  Well, the owners were there. :)  Nobou has a smaller menu at lunch, and we ended up ordering three entrees even though we were full with two because we just had to try more - it was just so good.  They used their own homegrown purple basil in several of the drinks and dishes and because I raved about it so much they cut me some and sent me home with a big bunch of basil!  How nice is that?!  I wondered how a place could have such a high rating with 103 reviews - really, that many people loved it?  Yep.  Now I see why.  Wish I was downtown more.  Also wish more places had non-brunch Sunday food.  Cause I like myself a cocktail and a nice lunch on Sundays. :)",

The server wasn't surly, but ... maybe indifferent is the word I'm looking for.  Example: He botched the opening of the Japanese soft drink my friend ordered specifically for the opening fizz (it didn't) and just said, \"Oh, well, that happens.\"  Not! when the opening show is the only reason for ordering such a high-priced soft drink!  Food was kind of meh, though I did enjoy the bonito flakes waving back and forth on the okonomiyaki.  We were especially unimpressed with the pork buns--dry buns, room-temp pork fat--as I said, meh.  We weren't greeted, weren't sped on our way after with a cheery smile, just didn't feel wanted.  Not a habit we're going to acquire, for sure.",

So well reviewed, hard to get in, etc.  Let me tell you our experience:  It's in an old, ugly, depressing, small home across from the downtown Bianco's in Heritage Square.  Dreary with a capital \"D\".  The server, who was pleasant, began by saying, \"Hi, what can I grab you?\"  Yep.   She was clueless about any of the wine selections. The restaurant week menu looked good, but oh, my.  Pitiful lobster roll on a white store bought tasting roll. Could have had better at Bluewater Grill. Entree was O.K., but sparse-really sparse. Dessert was fine, but 1 of 3 choices was deep fried as was one of the choices in the Bento Boxes. Chicken nuggets at best.  We left hungry and disappointed.  We had such fond memories when Nobou's was next to Cowboy Ciao's at SeaSaw... During the regular times they have a larger menu that very well may be a huge improvement, but you can't change the environment.  A big waste of money for the mediocre fare.",

My friend had the Panko-Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, I did not try it, but he really enjoyed it. Although, it was pretty small for the price, and the \"side\" of coleslaw, while really tasty, was hardly a side.. more like a little dollop. & the sandwich itself was pretty small as well. I had the Okonomiyaki, it was by far one of the weirdest things I have ever had, but damned if it wasn't delicious. The first couple bites I had to figure out what the heck I was even eating, and I wasn't sure 'till about halfway through that I even liked it. It was THAT weird. It was salty, with a little crunch, and had a lovely light mayo drizzled on top. YUM! I would recommend the more adventurous eater to try this, it definitely is not for everyone. I did find a small fish bone in mine, but it is made in house, so I wasn't too mad about it, haha. We also split a little pot of ginger & Jasmine tea because they were out of the one we originally wanted, bummer. The place was dead when we went, but the music was AMAZING, and the paint and decor of the place was so cute! I loved it, it was very my style, but some may not enjoy it, it was very plain, but again.. my style. I'd recommend going during dinner, I hear it's more lively then.",

If you go to Nobuo, make sure you order 6 kinds of food cause they only provide a mini portion of the food. I tried to order okonomiyaki which I found surprisingly great and probably the best okonomiyaki in town, Kumamoto oyster with Uni which is absolutely splendid, but it was only a small portion, and a fantastic coconut curry grilled lamb with mango salad which is the most addictive food cause I'm craving for more. Overall I'm highly satisfied. Wonderful dining experience indeed ;))",

I went to the soft opening with ma Boy Brian T, and have been back several times with him, his wife Tina T and other friends. this review is not about the food; which is a 5 star rating. lets be clear. this review is based solely on my most recent visit, then bumped up 2 stars for all of the past visits. Yup, if your a math whiz, i just said my last visit is a 1 star rating. unreal. I'm tempted to not even write this review. i love this place that much. but it was so horrible. we walked over (i live Downtown), heading to the science center, and decided to \"attempt\" to try NoBuo on a Sunday for lunch. as we walked inside the awesome old school house, an overwhelming smell of cat piss almost made us vomit. seriously. it was like an old cat lady, with 86 cats died 3 weeks ago and the cats just pissed everywhere inside. imagine that. now make it real life. Boom. no exaggeration. Strike 1. So, we were seated (literally the only people in the entire place at 12 on a Sunday) and started to look at the food options. about, oh, I'd say .1 nano second into this awesome idea, we asked if we could eat on the patio. \"sorry, that's for desert and drinks only\". um. wtf? really? so your saying i cant eat my Tapas pork belly sammy out side, but i can eat a freaking cake? really? get the Fawk out'a here. Strike 2. So, not to be an overly rude individual, we say \"OK, we'll just sit outside and have a drink then head to Rose and Crown for a bite\". they were completely OK with this idea. Again, OK................ ? so the girl asks what we would like to drink, simple: 1 vodka soda, 1 vodka tonic. easy. we go outside, sit down, about 2 minutes late she comes back out and says \"were all out of tonic water and cant make either drink\". strike 3. Done. i didn't say anything to the girlfriend or the waitress. if my money isn't good enough for you, then neither are my words. Luckily, the GF is even quicker on the draw then I. she was already passing the gate, leaving the place, before i could comprehend wtf this girl was uttering out of mouth. unreal. side note, as we sat on the patio at rose and crown, spending allot of money on liquor (which they gladly accepted) we counted over a dozen people walking into Nobou, and then immediately leaving. not one stayed. i guess the waitress got her wish; to not have to work that day. must have been an epic hangover or something. maybe it wasn't cat pee, maybe it was mustard gas. I'm really not sure. but it was nostril burning, vomit inducing, bad. just thinking about it now give's me nausea.",

I knew Nobuo at Teeter House, Binkley's, and Barrio Cafe we all in the running for a James Beard award this year. Having dined at Binkley's (a definite must if you can) we decided to try this place. We had several tapas including the tako age, watermelon salad, squash blossoms and a few others. All of our food was cooked perfectly and tasted divine. My favorite dish was the sea bass and shitake mushrooms. The flavors were amazing and the sea bass melts in your mouth while the shitake mushrooms provided that meaty feel to the dish. We are definitely planning to come back. Great food and great service.",

I was not a fan of the Chicken Nanban, which was disappointing since it was the largest course we ordered. Overall, the flavor profiles (at least of the fish-based dishes) were unique and SO delicious.   This place is certainly pricey, but absolutely worth it. Most dishes are around $20, and if you're ordering from the front of the menu, those will each only be about 2-4 bites of food. But the food is amazing quality, and unlike anything I've eaten before. I just wish I could afford to eat more of it ;)  My husband and I shared 4 courses from the front of the menu (\"lighter\" fare), 1 course from the back (more substantial), and a dessert. We certainly weren't stuffed by the end, but felt comfortably full.  The staff was great, the atmosphere was quaint but left something to be desired. But I will forever crave the Shiromi Carpaccio, and my husband was completely thrilled by the birthday dinner we had here. Highly recommend this place for a special occasion (but I wish we could eat here every day!).",

We made a reservation and decided to try a new place before heading to a concert nearby. We were immediately sat at the worst table in the house. Stuffed in a corner by the door which slammed loud every time someone walked in and out. Also it's summer time and it was hot and uncomfortable in this place. My husband asked if we could sit at any other table to which the hostess curtly responded \"we are fully booked for the night\" promptly seating us at the bad table. Thanks.  Well I'll make a long story short...if you want to have Slow service (sat there for about 2 hours) an empty wallet, fatty disgusting chicken that was worse then Panda Express, black cod that smelled like it was caught last year, (got sick to my stomach and started dry heaving when she put it on the table) then by all means dine here.

The duck was overlooked and very dry and even though we told the server, she just shrugged it off.  Yellowtail sashimi with grapefruit was nothing special, flavor was kind of flat - I've had better.  $200.00 for two at lunch with a limited menu ..... Overpriced!",

    "text": "Was on a visit to the Phoenix area and decided to participate in Arizona's restaurant week. I read a handful of the reviews for this place and decided to give it a go.   From the outside, I thought that this place looked very unique in that it was contained in a converted house; I was seated in what looked like the usual dining area. Yet somehow they put three tables in the room. It was a very interesting use of the space.  For an appetizer, I was served a small plate that consisted of kimchi (cabbage, shrimp, oil & chili) & Tako age (fried octopus & yuzu aioli). The kimchi was a nice sized portion and the flavor wasn't as strong as some places that I've been to. The fried octopus was nice and tender. The main bento box consisted of a salad, fried seashell crab, yellow tail ceviche, big eye tuna sashimi & sea bass. Overall, I liked all the seafood. The presentation on the crab was nice and the crab was tasty.   If the food was good, why the low rating? The service here was terrible. I don't know if it was because the party of six next to us was ordering a crapload of food and tons of wine, but our table got no attention whatsoever. When it takes 20 minutes for something as simple as filling a glass of water, then that's a problem. The waiter never checked in on us to see how the food was, yet the party nearby had three waiters (including ours) at their every whim. Disappointing, to say the least; let's just say that the waiter got tipped appropriately.  I've been to upscale places around the country with similar food. If I had a choice, I'd go to the other places every time.",

    "text": "3.5 stars but rounding down since I probably wouldn't eat again here. After dining at mostly casual places in Phoenix, I wanted to try at least one fancier restaurant before heading back to San Francisco. Nobuo offers a seared foie gras dish, which is one of the reasons I decided to dine here since foie gras is now banned in California. I came in for an early dinner on Sunday without reservations, since I was planning on sitting at the bar. The restaurant was fairly empty around 6pm, and we were greeted and seated promptly. We ordered:  -Grapefruit & Hamachi (Avocado, White Truffle Ponzu Oil, $14, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nobuo-at-teeter-house-phoenix?select=2K6GeZYKrab6u399cHdkCA#2K6GeZYKrab6u399cHdkCA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nobu...</a>): AMAZING. Don't leave here without ordering this dish! The hamachi was super fresh and melted in your mouth, and went really well with the grapefruit and avocado. -Hassun (Seasonal Local Vegetable Antipasto w/Cauliflower, Eggplant, Fried Tofu, Yu Lan, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nobuo-at-teeter-house-phoenix?select=2K6GeZYKrab6u399cHdkCA#hQryOQk1IfCBwPRfOwJUnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nobu...</a>): Yum! I enjoyed the variety of vegetables, and the different styles of preparation and sauces. Recommended! -Braised Oxtail (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nobuo-at-teeter-house-phoenix?select=2K6GeZYKrab6u399cHdkCA#8vrOi7SDU2vegQlizQ7j6A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nobu...</a>): Pretty good, but not amazing. This was one of their specials that day. The 2 pieces of braised oxtail (very good sized portion) were fall off the bone tender, but the daikon in the dish was still hard and difficult to eat. This dish would've been better if it was served with rice or another grain to soak up some of the delicious sauce. I'm not sure I would order this dish again.   -Foie Gras (Saikyo Miso Marinated, Pan Seared, $24, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nobuo-at-teeter-house-phoenix?select=2K6GeZYKrab6u399cHdkCA#4sM9dVR9r-OEfrwS7Ws1hA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/nobu...</a>): Very so-so. The miso marinade didn't really come through, and I didn't think the pear went that well with the foie gras. I wouldn't order this again for $24!  I wish we had time to do the tasting menu, but weren't able to due to time constraints. The service was mostly attentive and they were able to speed up our dinner since we had to head to the airport after. However, since there weren't many guests, one of the servers and the host spent most of the time chit chatting, which was distracting for me. I also didn't like how the manager brushed off the FourSquare offer I received for a complimentary watermelon salad. When I showed him the deal per the note on FourSquare, he said that was an old deal, and they don't currently have that dish, and gave us a terse apology. However, he didn't say they would look into removing that message for future customers, and he also didn't offer us another complimentary dish as a replacement. I guess he figured he didn't have to bother since we were tourists, which is a terrible customer service approach. Also, we noticed the chefs are much more attentive to the Japanese customers, so I would recommend trying to come with a Japanese friend.  Overall, I wasn't super impressed by the food (aside from the hamachi dish) for the money we spent, and I'm not sure I would come back for the so-so service. This restaurant is located more on the outskirts of downtown, but only a few blocks away from Chase Field. There was plenty of free parking available on a Sunday night only a block or two away (there are only 3-4 spots available right in front of the restaurant).",

Everything is super pricey--including the beer. I don't mind splurging on a nice meal here and there, but when so doing I don't like to leave hungry.

It is walkable to the Hyatt, Sheraton, Westin, and other hotels in the area - so if you are visiting from out of town - a great place to go after work. Everything on the menu was delicious, it was prepared well and the presentation was super. See attached pictures. We ordered a variety of items such as Oysters, Grapefruit Hamachi, and House Cured Salmon. We were a large group of 8 people from out of town for work - with that size of a group, the food was expensive, it was almost $8 a bite. The drinks menu is stellar as well - they carry Japanese whiskey, which seemed to sit well with my colleagues. 5 stars, if there if a \"work tab\" in play. Otherwise 4 stars.",

The flavor alone is something to rave about! The only down fall is we we on a time crunch and wanted to share the 7 course dinner but the waiter said we couldn't do that. That's the only reason for one less star. We were going to share everything anyways but we understood and just picked other dishes. The waiter was well educated in the menu & we often turned to him about what to order for drinks & dinner menu. We loved every dish that came out. We loved the small quaintness of the house and overall enjoyed everything. The dessert was superb! It is a bit on the pricey side but well worth it. Per other reviews I thought I would not be full but to my surprise we left very satisfied. Can't wait to return and try some other things on the menu!i",

Not even a glance.   She poured wine in such a hurry while looking elsewhere.  Food was thrown down on the table.   It is rare to encounter this kind of service anywhere, let alone a pricey place.

It's located in a beautiful Victorian home so rich in character and warmth.  From the moment you enter, you feel like you are \"home\" and they take such good care of you.  Every single thing I had at this place was absolutely phenomenal.  The Hamachi is to die for as everyone says, I also had the cod and crab salad which are must haves!  Their dessert I had which I think was a pumpkin cake was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.  This was an absolute treat and a very rare find.  I'm from LA which is a culinary oasis and this was one of the best places I've had dinner at in a long time.  If you are ever in the downtown Phoenix area, you've got to try this place!  It's walking distance from Downtown Phoenix hotels and hotspots.  And you will love that it's very reasonable... I spent almost $60 including tip.  If I had a dinner of this caliber in LA, I would have spent twice that amount.  Make sure you check out their bathroom, it has this really cool wallpaper with birds... very exquisite.    And lastly, don't ask for rice or miso soup, they don't have it.  This is not your \"typical\" Japanese fare... :).",

    "text": "Had some time to kill before the Ultimate pleY Date Yelp event, and I'd wanted to share my love of Nobuo's Dark chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream and sugared orange peels with my happy-go-lucky cousin, who has never been here before, so we stopped by at 5:17p to find that Nobuo wouldn't open till 5:30p, so we waited outside in the comfortable patio.  After watching a couple of employees add lanterns to their outdoor umbrellaed tables, I noticed the \"OPEN\" sign on the front door, so we entered the resto, whereupon we were greeted warmly by a male host and shown to a two-top.  I didn't like the energy in that room, so I asked if we could sit elsewhere, and he said to choose wherever we wanted to sit.  We were the first customers, so we chose a four-top, knowing we wouldn't be taking up space for very long, anyway.  Glasses of water were delivered, and soon we met our female server (whose name on the receipt reflected \"Butai\").  When she laid down the menus, I told her we would only be having dessert and could we see the dessert menu?  I wished we had a video of the look she gave us, a look of pure distaste, as she gathered up the dinner and beverage menus and said \"We don't have dessert menus, as we only have two...\" and proceeded to tell us of the mousse and the almond-orange fritters.  She walked away, and as we loudly discussed about our losing our interest in dining there, she came back with napkins and utensils and asked if we decided what we were going to have.  I decided to forgo our server's very cold treatment and asked for the mousse.  After all, I'd already finished a glass of ice-cold water and cousin's phone needed recharging...    When Butai placed our chocolate mousse <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg#rK8m1rxl50PB69_c2YqQTg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0Bux...</a> on the table, I wanted to send it back.  Where was the lovely bowl and presentation of the last dessert I had here?  Was she serious in presenting us with this stale-looking mousse, with cracked edges and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystals on it?  I don't know about you, but the only times I've seen crystals on ice cream is when it has slightly melted and placed back in the freezer to re-freeze.  For me, seeing crystals on ice cream is a sign that it is old...  I brought the receptacle and showed it to the male host, who assured me that all of the mousse is made daily at 4:00a and seeing cracks and bubbles in the mousse is normal, so I decided we would go ahead and try it, if for nothing else but to have something to report here.  The dessert was definitely not up to par with the pretty bowl <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0Buxoc0cRqjpvkezo3bqog?select=o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ#o9jIksB-MObhCxoI_msekQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/0Bux...</a> I had during our October OYE in taste and presentation, but it was OK.  The mousse was still cold and stiff, and it had a mouth-feel more of like thick chocolate ganache filling/icing on a cake- certainly not the silky-smooth chocolate decadence I knew it could be.  My cousin had to warm up to the dish, as the sound of chocolate and green tea together didn't seem like a great combo to her (I told her to trust me).  She also never enjoyed orange and chocolate together, but she liked it in this dessert.    I understand that the knowledge of having to serve only dessert instead of dinner AND dessert, which translates to a higher table bill, can be a bit of a disappointment, but why must you show your displeasure to your guests?  Butai, you were lucky that my cousin even left you the change for a tip- she didn't want to give you anything, and you certainly didn't deserve it!  When I told other Yelp friends about the sub-par service and dessert we just had, one replied she didn't enjoy the last time we had apps here (I think it was around Halloween and First Friday?) either.  Cousin and I thought it very poor taste that our server gave us that awful, condescending look after finding out we were just going to have dessert; We didn't deserve that!  I am never going to recommend Nobuo to anyone, anymore.  I even promised my Japanese friend (who lives and works overseas) I'd treat her to a dining experience here when she comes to visit.  Guess I'll have to find another place to take her...  I don't want to risk getting the same treatment from Butai, or from another server should we come back here.    Sorry, Nobuo, but I won't be returning.",

    "text": "My boyfriend brought me here for a birthday dinner and wowsers! Afterwards his exact words were 'Holy crap. What a dinner.' I echo his sentiment. I was in Phoenix for a few days and made it to Nobuo two more times - one time for a solo impromtu happy hour and another time for lunch. I just wish I went everyday!!  Nobuo bills itself as a Japanese tea house, but I feel like the food is True fusion - various Asian with some European influence. This is mind-blowing to me. It is really hard to truly fuze Asian flavors from different countries and regions together. In fact normally I steer way clear of fusion Asian places. I prefer real Asian food - Japanese, Chinese or Korean and am normally a purist, keep my Chinese food chinese please. But Nobuo!!! Whoa, he is able to mix different ingredients from different regions in one dish and have everything perfect! The flavor, look, presentation, texture.  The food alone here blows this place away. Add a bottle of a European white varital at a decent price and good company for an unforgettable evening.   The ambiance is beautiful... maybe this is where the 'tea house' theme fits in. The Teeter House is cute and the small rooms give it a very intimate setting. There is also a small bar which was perfect for me to come back solo for a glass of wine and snack.  If I described all the food I ate, this review would be WAY too long, but here is the list: watermelon salad, kim-chi, nasu, grapefruit hamachi, shiromi carpaccio, warm duck salad, an oyster/uni, Karei Karaage, tako and tomato, yellowtail ceviche, house-cured salmon, fritters w/red bean. From the lunch menu: soft-shell crab sandwich, pork buns (w/pickled mustard greens - yum!), Thai-style shrimp salad. Everything was great... If I was pressed and I could only order a couple of items - I would get the hamachi, yellowtail and shiromi carpaccio.  I have a feeling this place may appear in my dreams. I'm also tempted to find any excuse for a weekend trip to Phoenix just to come back.",

Since the wait at Pizzeria Bianco is usually a while, we usually head over here for a few nibbles before heading back for the pizza.  However... the few nibbles always usually mean 6-7 dishes.  Yes, some items they have are small but we always get the fois gras, the duck salad, and the lamb... Which are more like entrees.  Not to mention usually the pork belly rice... the last two are usually whatever sushi/sashimi special they have on the menu.  The food here is so good and so consistent.  I've actually been so inspired as to constantly try and recreate the food here at home or at work.",

I just was looking for the incorporation of more ingredients/foods more foreign to my palette.    The restaurant was is a cool old house but I feel they could use some help on the interior design.  It looked like they just moved in last week and decided to open a restaurant.  I think the space could be much more charming.    The portions were limited but that is expected at a restaurant like this.",

I started with the Spanish mackerel sashimi which was as beautiful as it was delicious. The entire silver fish was presented, with individual pieces sliced off. After I ate the sashimi, the bones were deep fried for a second way to eat the fish. The fois gras I had for my main course was to die for. Cooked perfectly and served with grilled peaches and some kind of edible leaf. The presentation was beautiful. I'll be back here every time I come to the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "So I know what your thinking, Sushi in Arizona!?!?! YES!!!  I highly recommend checking at Nobuo at Teeter house! I honestly have to say this was the highlight of my trip with my husband. After having a disappointing lunch earlier that day, my husband and I wanted to have an awesome dinner. So I looked up online to find the best places to eat in Arizona and Nobuo was one of the restaurants that was suggested. We arrived on Saturday night at around 9. The restaurant is located at the historical Heritage Square in Phoenix. We had a little trouble trying to find the place since we aren't locals and drove around the block a few times before finding the parking structure.   Nobuo is located inside the Teeter house which was built in the 1899 and they converted into a  restaurant. I think this is what got my husband and I a little confused because we were actually looking for something that resembled a typical restaurant. I honestly felt like I was walking into a home because they had a front porch with chairs and the 3 separate small dining rooms. They were pretty much booked but we were able to quickly get seated at the bar. First off, I loved the atmosphere, everything was intimate and you can just feel the history of the place. Dinner option was tapas style so my husband and I ordered 4 items including dessert.  Seabass and Mushroom Pork Belly wrapped in Banana Leaf (highly recommend) Grapefruit and Hamachi House Cured Salmon (highly recommend)  Everything we ordered was delicious and I loved how chef Nobuo himself would come out and serve our meals explaining each plate to us. Surprisingly we were full with just these 4 dishes.   The service was impeccable and Chef Nobuo even came out and talked to my husband and I about the history of the place.   My husband and I can't wait for our next trip to Arizona to eat here again.",

The lunch menu is limited, but has a good mix of salads, entrees, and sandwiches. Omg PORK BELLY BUNS!  You get two open faced buns with fall apart-tender big chunk of pork belly drizzled with this savory asian 'jus' with a hint of five spice, perfectly complemented with some cucumber for a refreshing crunch. The bun itself is made to perfection-spongy, yet lightly fluffy, with a nice smooth skin and great flavor.  It is almost a meal in itself.    The lamb dish comes with 4 decent sized lamb chops cooked to perfection.  I was afraid they would have an overpowering curry taste, but to my delight, they did not. They were slightly charred and had a nice light flavor.  The mango and endive salad was the ideal accompaniment to the curried lamb.  We also tried the katsu sandwich.  By then, we were getting full, but found someway to pack it in when we tasted the shoku pan bread that it comes on.  Can I take a whole loaf of this home please? It is beyond delicious!  It reminds me of breakfasts at my grandfather's house in Tokyo.  The katsu itself is good, drizzled with a little *authentic* tonkatsu sauce, but didn't compare to the other two dishes.  I make chicken katsu at home, so I guess it's lost some excitement for me.   All in all, I will be back soon to try more! Very good value for the quality of food that you receive!  If you park in the heritage square garage, there is no charge when you validate your ticket.  On your walk there just watch out for all the cats!  haha",

The whole meal was rather expensive for the volume we got, but you are really paying for the skill of the cooks and the general ambiance of the restaurant. While all of the food was good, the best part of the meal, both my date and I agreed on, was our White Dragon Jasmine Tea. Our server allowed us to seep the same kettle several times and we nearly filled up on just the Tea!  I would highly recommend this place as a good romantic date locationh",

I would have loved to have tried more, but we didn'thave the time.  I do recommend this place if you're in the mood for some interesting Japanese \"bites\".  Please heed the previous reviews.

A small, early 1900's house turned into a restaurant.  Our section had only 3 tables.    We started with appetizers and we were NOT impressed.  We got Fried Octopus (okay, but nothing great), Bonito potato chips (interesting flavor combo, but not amazing), and Miso Bacon Eggplant (couldn't taste any bacon.)  The one appetizer we all liked was the panko breaded tofu, which was excellent.   We were a little worred when our next dish wasn't amazing either.  We tried a shrimp over cucumber salad dish.  The shrimp was okay, but the whole dish was missing something.   However, the meal took a great 180 after that point.  Next was a whitefish dish which had 6 thin cuts of fish served on a plate garlic, peppers, and some other seasoning.  Hot oil is poured over the fish at your table to slightly cook the fish.  AMAZING.  It's served with bread for dipping into the oil afterwards.  THIS IS A PERFECT DISH.    Pork Bun:  MUST HAVE!  I love pork belly buns and this one rivals David Changs.  The pork is amazing, the bun was perfect.   Curry Lamb Chops:  AMAZING.  Absolutely the best lamb I have ever had.  I've never had lamb I really loved before, but this dish was perfect...simply perfect.   Overall, a great meal.  I do think they need to work on their appetizers, which is what kept it from five stars.  I would definitely come back.",

Nobuo comes from Sea Saw in Old Town Scottdale, which was part of Peter Kasperski's empire that seems to be falling apart more and more. When Sea Saw unfortunately closed, we all knew that Nobuo would either run off to California and open up there, or come downtown. Glad he came back to the city, and turned an awfully ran old tea house into a fantastic, spotless, neighborhood hang out.   The building, built in the early 1900's, is a beautiful Japanese tavern style, from the furniture, to the art, and onto the gorgeous solid one piece bar top. He hangs out behind this bar and creates his culinary masterpieces here right in plain view. The waiters and waitresses, meanwhile create your unique cocktails made with fresh fruits and veggies as well as fresh garnishes. I tried the cucumber martini which was fantastic. Look for the specials each night and try whatever they are. Nobuo also does Omakase (chef's choice) where you and three of your closest friends sit at the aforementioned wood counter and try whatever he puts in front of you.   At some point in the night, you'll wonder how much you're spending. Nobuo at Teeter House is not cheap, but good things aren't cheap. When you purchase fresh produce from McClendon, fish from Japan, and rent in Heratige Square, you have to charge a premium for your product. If you don't understand this, then you shouldn't shy away from Taco Bell anymore. They do offer a great happy hour M-F if you want to save money, but I recommend Nobuo for a night when you don't have to worry about how much your spending. It's a very special restaurant, and deserves to be enjoyed in a very special way.",

    "text": "5 star review baby! My husband and I came here at the recommendation of friends who are fellow foodies. We were not disappointed!  We had the following dishes: Shiromi Carpaccio Yellowtail Ceviche Seabass and Mushroom Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich Pork Belly Buns  The Shiromi Carpaccio was basically a white fish with they poured this heavenly hot sesame oil with ginger yuzo and garlic all over the fish just before serving. The sesame oil lightly cooked the fish and it was sublime. It was served with homemade focaccia bread and we liked the focaccia bread so much we ordered more so we could dip it into the sauce. The Yellowtail Ceviche was served in Asian style spoons with sesame seed and shredded taro on top. It was a mouthful of flavorful goodness! The shredded taro was crispy and this added a nice texture. The Seabass and Mushrooms was unlike anything I've ever had before. It was baked in parchment paper with garlic butter, sake, and soy. The seabass was very very tender and almost melted in my mouth. The mushrooms were just succulent. I would say the Shiromi Carpaccio, the Yellowtail Ceviche, and the Seabass and Mushrooms were my favorite dishes.   The Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich was very good with housemade focaccia and kanzuri aioli. It all tasted very fresh. It was very filling and I really liked the crunchy texture of the crab. The Pork Belly Buns with braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens were tasty and also very filling. I loved the chewy flavorful goodness of the pork belly.   My husband and I ordered 5 things and we honestly couldn't finish everything. We were so full and happy! I also had a very good flower tea that I enjoyed. My husband ordered a beer that he had never heard of and enjoyed it immensely.   The atmosphere is quaint. Nobuo is intimate and quiet in a little old house and you can tell they put a lot of thought into the decor. It's the perfect place for a date.   I was quite impressed with both the food and the service and the chef even came out of the kitchen to shake our hands and say hello. I would highly recommend Nobuo if you are looking for an upscale, quiet meal, with awesome food and service. I hardly ever come to Phoenix because I'm from Cali but I will make a point of coming back to Nobuo whenever I get a chance!! Definitely go for the Shiromi Carpaccio, the Yellowtail Ceviche, and the Seabass and Mushrooms!",

    "text": "Phenomenal.  Nobuo brought out taste buds I didn't even knew I had.  We had reservations across the street at PB for a large party.  It was a 2 to 2.5 hour wait so we decided to stroll across the way to the small pub for a beer.  Then decided to pop in to see Nobuo's place that has been on the list for a long time.  We didn't have reservations but were able to get a table and order some drinks and a few small plates.  The inside is quaint and tranquil.  It is a great place for a small intimate meal with a couple or two.  Not big enough for a large group but more for a date night.  We ordered a couple of beers and a mixed drink.  For food we ordered Japanese fries, kimchi, and shiromi carpaccio.  The carpaccio came first.  Four very elegantly dressed spoons that were perfectly made for one bite.  The flavors were amazing and the textures were perfection.  Next came the fries.  The fries had dried bonito on them and were also ridiculously tasty.  The last dish was the kimchi.  The plate had cabbage and shrimp and when the waiter brought it he poured a hot sesame oil on top of it that made the plate sizzle and brought out some crazy aromas.  The chili oil on the plate was delicious.  They brought some bread so we could soak up all those amazing flavors off the plate and none of it went to waste.  The bill was expensive but so so worth it.  I have found a new favorite place that I can not wait to try again.  Next time we are skipping the group pizza party at the 2 hour wait place and making reservations at the Teeter House.  Nobuos blew away our expectations.  Update:  Returned on 3/9/13 My wife and I made reservations after being blown away on our initial visit.  We didn't quite get to do the entire menu the first time and could not wait to come back.  Our waitress was extremely nice and helpful.  She knew the entire menu up and down as well as the specials.    The menu changed from our last visit as well.    We ordered the Kumachi, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Shiromi Carpaccio, Yellow Tail Ceviche, Sashimi special, Seabass & Mushroom, and the Ox tail special.    First we received the kumachi which was a salad with a very nice spicy dressing, then came the sashimi which tasted phenomenal.  It came with 8 pieces of fish and fresh wasabi that knocked your socks off.  The grapefruit and hamachi came out next.  Four spoons of blissful flavors.  Next came the yellowtail ceviche which was another 4 spoons of delight.  The carpaccio was next.  Hot, wonderful, and foccacia bread to clean up the remaining oils.  About this point I am all the sudden sad because I realize we only have two dishes left.  The seabass and mushroom was done in parchment paper and tasted completely different from anything else.  Earthy, savory, very tasty.  Last came the ox tail special.  Hands down the best dish out of all of them.  It really tasted like it was from an entire different restaurant.  I loved every single bite and every single component of this dish.   Everything was executed masterfully but this was just ridiculous.  Chef Nobuo's flavor range is off the chart.  I felt like we went from Japanese food with the kumachi, and sashimi to a twist of Mexican with the yellow tail ceviche, then to North American with the seabass and mushrooms, and then to heaven with the ox tail stew.  It was a flavor journey that I never wanted to end.   We finished with the green tea and chocolate dessert.  I can't think of a better meal in my entire life.  Taste bud HEAVEN.  Thank you Chef Nobuo!  I rank them in this ascending order: Green tea ice cream Kumachi Sashimi Carpaccio Seabass Grapefruit and Hamachi Yellowtail Ceviche Ox tail special  I can't wait to go for lunch...THIS ladies and gentlemen is how it is done.",

    "text": "I've been a fan since the Hapa days and again he doesn't disappoint. We had a short wait for our table on the porch and had some tasty tea flavored cocktails served by a busy but pleasant server (aka: the blonde-a later-to-be-revealed & important distinction).   The radish salad and curried lamb were 86ed and replaced with an original spin on kim chee and a bangin' 5 spice oxtail on a thick slice of very tender, almost potato-like daikon. How lucky for me since those are 2 of my favorite things anyway. Hamachi, oysters/uni and pork belly bun were all delicious, explosive bites of flavor. They also has a small but impressive cold sake selection and had one of my faves, Rihaku Junmai Ginjo \"Wandering Poet\".    I would have happily given 5 stars as the food was really spot-on, the hostess (aka: brunette 1) and my server (brunette 2) were another story. The hostess acted like she wanted to be anywhere but there, her face said, \"I'll seat you but would rather change a smelly, sh*t-filled diaper\".  The server had about the same attitude. Her face said, \"oh great, I'll bet these hicks want sweet & sour shrimp\".  She perked up right quick when I ordered the 5th & 6th item and the sake-the bill was clearly going to be waaay over a hundred bucks.    Whatever. I'll go back.",

    "text": "There are restaurants and then there are restaurants. This is a restaurant with a capital R. To put this in perspective I think that our total bill was close to $500. With that in mind the expectations are very high for the Nobuo and it does not disappoint. This is very much so a special event restaurant. We had the chef's choice menu with the wine paired and it was fantastic. The setting is intimate and the service was awesome. I have only been here once and am not sure when I would go here again but that is not for a lack of desire to go. As you would expect with this type of restaurant each of the courses were small so don't come hungry. I would recommend a beer and the scotch eggs at the pub next door before starting your dinner here. I am not enough of a foodie to be snobby about wine pairings or detect the subtle nuances of one pairing vs. another in order to enhance my experience. That said, this was the first time where I felt like I could appreciate the complimentary notes of a particular wine with a dish.   Not being a nuanced person I only noticed this at the extremes, for example for one course they brought out a wine that could be described as skunky on its own but once the course arrive of bitter Brussel sprouts with balsamic the pairing was memorable. The other courses mostly my opinion was that I was drinking a good wine with good food. But that one course with what seemed to be an odd wine flavor tells me, the layperson, that they're doing something right and are presenting an experience that I will not get elsewhere. Absolutely fantastic and I love what they do. I hope some day to be back.",

    "text": "One of my favorite times of the year in Las Vegas is Restaurant Week, so when I learned that Arizona Restaurant Week coincided with a work trip to Phoenix, I picked a place close to the hotel where I am staying (the Hyatt Recency) to check it out. Glad to report that my selection, Nobuo at the Teeter House, not only met my expectations but also was better than nearly any place I've been to in Vegas.  For $40 (cheaper than the usual $50 in Vegas), I got a delicious appetizer of long beans, spicy fried tofu, watermelon with feta, and some sort of curd (?). Then, for the main dish, an incredible bento box with four pieces of sashimi, a soft-shell crab salad, black cod, seafood rice, and a green salad. Top that off with a rice pudding and two drinks (a Japanese IPA for $13 and a glass of domestic rose for $12), and you have one fantastic meal. (I also added on an order of their grapefruit hamachi, which was $8 for two pieces. Might as well go big or go home...)  The restaurant is located in a historic building in Heritage Square. I've never been to this part of Phoenix before, but it's right by the baseball stadium and a science museum. Although the area was crowded earlier in the day, it was pretty dead when I ate at 8, but I was still surprised that there were not more diners ... particularly with Restaurant Week going on.  If I lived in Phoenix, this would definitely be at the top of my list ... and not just during Restaurant Week. I can't think of a more romantic place for date night anytime of the year. I'm just sad that my husband wasn't with me to try the other RW offering, which included a pork belly bun and coconut curry lamb. Yum!",

It comes with focaccio to soak up the flavorful oil.  It is a small quaint restaurant - very quiet on a Sunday evening. Attentive hosts with great service.",

So, for the price....I'm not sure. The service left much to be desired considering it's a \"fine dining\" restaurant with a James Beard chef. Waitresses were in casual attire... like sneakers. Our waitress walked up to the table and basically was like \"here's the menu, do you want seafood or meat and what dessert do you want?\"...well, I'd like an explanation of what I'm potentially ordering first of all. What is in the meat vs. seafood Bento box? What's your recommended dessert? Do you have any non alcoholic beverages?...when the food came, the explanation of what each part consisted of was pretty basic--not sure if she maybe just didn't know the menu well? The courses were also quite rushed...we were in and out in slightly over an hour for a three course menu...she was pushing us for sure. But overall, it was pretty delicious and unique.

We came at late lunch time on a Saturday, and were quite impressed with this restaurant! The restaurant occupies an old timely house with around 10 small tables inside with ample seating pause, and has very soothing music to give it a chill ambience.   Our server was very patient with us, as it was our experience here and recommended dishes to suit our lunchtime needs.   For our entrees, we got an Ebi salad and okonomiyaki. The salad was a lighter, smaller portion that reminds me of traditional Vietnamese vermicelli dishes with a fish sauce type of taste. The shrimp that came with it were cooked to perfection. My dish, however, was pretty bomb dot com. It has the texture of a takoyaki dish in a pancake format, and definitely filled me up. It also has a delicious mix of nori, ginger, and possibly a unagi flavor mix to it.   Dish sizes were smaller than we would like, but you can't argue with the taste of our food!",

We ordered the Sashimi (Hamachi), Yellow Tail Ceviche, Tuna Tataki, warm duck salad, and the Coconut Curry Lamb.  Our service was...average.  Honestly I was expecting more from the dining experience as a whole.  The food was above average, but a little below our expectations.  Our favorite dishes were the Yellow Tail Ceviche and the Coconut Curry Lamb.  The lamb was probably the best I've ever had.  The other dishes were good not great.  The duck was a little overcooked.

    "text": "We (2 people) went on a Thursday night at 7p.m., we were seated immediately. The restaurant was just filled enough that it wasn't too loud in 1 of the many small, very quaint, simple but elegantly decorated rooms. Service was outstanding. We indulged in the specialty cocktail menu which was excellent. We proceeded to work our way through the menu: 3 cold dishes (Grapefruit & Hamachi , Shiromi Carpaccio, Oyster/uni) & 6 warm dishes (Fried Soft Shell Shrimp, Warm Duck Salad, Soft Shell Crab Salad, Coconut Curry Lamb, Foie Gras, and Steamed Clams with chicken), all were very unique in taste and beautiful presentation & if I may add, timed perfectly, finishing 1 dish, then serving the other without feeling rushed. I will say that the weakest dish of 9 was the Steamed Clams with Chicken in both flavor and size of clams along with the inedible chicken feet.  I would like future customers to keep in mine that if you dine here, don't forget it is a modern Japanese Tapas (which means small dishes), same as if you were to go to a traditional Japanese restaurant and order sushi and sashimi a la cart. I did take note on several comments on TOO pricey. Nobuo At Teeter House is a blend of unique combinations of tastes which are well worth the try.",

I can't say that I would recommend anything on the menu since what u got was price fixed but I can say that it was incredibly delicious and left me craving more. This is located right next to the science museum downtown and across the way from the children's museum. Along with the very famous pizzeria bianco in the same plaza. It's a very small establishment in a repurposed house giving it a very private and intimate feel. I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion or date.",

The restaurant is inside a historic looking house in the heritage square of downtown Phoenix. It has a very lovely outdoor seating area, but we opted for indoors because of the heat.   We went at a less busy hour for lunch. Our waitress/hostess was very friendly. She did a great job explaining each dish for us and served quickly. Everything we tried was quite tasty but the hamachi appetizers were the best.",

It's set in an old house (est. 1909 I believe), and is very intimate.   We got 4 dishes: -vegetable starter plate (can't remember the Japanese name) *delicious and the selections change daily*  -warm duck salad *oh my gosh. It's a good thing they give you chopsticks because I would have eaten it in three seconds otherwise*  -A ranch batteries chicken dish with deviled egg salad on top *incredible* -some fish fish that I can't pronounce but I don't even eat fish and it was delicious  This is a brilliant place to go with a S.O. Because each plate is an experience. It's so amazingly complex and delicious, be willing to step outside the comfort zone and just go for it. You share each plate and they recommend you order 4 - 6. So, it can get pricy but man oh man is it worth it. It's truly a culinary experience and the wait staff is extremely diligent and good about timing and helping with suggestions!",

The building is a small old home that has been converted and doesn't seat many so be sure to make reservations ahead of time.  All the proportions were very small, but with each bite my mouth was filled with an amazing textures combination along with some unique pairs. We had big eye tuna titaki but instead of traditional ponzu sauce they used a red beet puree with a balsamic reduction. simply breath taking. The favorite of the table was the Grapefruit & Hamachi with avocado, white truffle ponzu oilhimatiche. It was served on a spoon and easy to take in one bite. All the textures and truffle to a hint a spicy made this dish very complex. After every course all of us girls had to regain our composure because the food was so wonderful it actual gave us goose bumps at times.  I look forward to a trip back out to Phoenix soon and this place will defiantly have my repeat business again!!",

It's in a cute heritage area just outside the mammoth convention centers and sport stadium, so parking is a bit of a pain.  Once you get inside, it's incredibly quaint.  There is a server/menu mismatch since I'm guessing there are not a lot of Asian people in the area.  So to hear the server (who looks like a student backpacker) describe an isakaya and items where there is some Chinese influence, it gave me a good laugh.  That being said, the food is excellent.  The portions are small so I'd recommend 3-4 dishes for 2 people.  We shared the curried lamb with mango (mmmm, so good!)  If there are any Vancouverites reading this, think Vij's lamb popsicles but marinaded in a different sauce.  The warm duck salad is excellent!  It's a neat twist to serve the salad warm and slightly seared and it paid off well.  The pork belly buns were delicious - I've never had these before!  They use the Chinese style steamed bun material but shape it into ovals that they fold in half and insert the pork belly filling.  Excellent!  The menu is small but very solid.  Service was OK and if this was more polished/authentic/better fitting to a higher-end Asian restaurant, I would bump this up to a 5.",

The Teeter House has so many memories for me and this is such a cute little house.  You feel like home.  All the servers and staff were so attentive and helpful in explaining these unique Japanese out of the ordinary dishes.  And try things we did!  From dishes off the cold plates served on tiny spoons (you have to try the Grapefruit and Hamachi - OMG) with flavors that exploded in your mouth to perfectly cooked lamb chops and yellow tail.  Our sous chef, Chris,  was a delightful addition to our table, explaining every detail of the execution and flavors and was an excellent saleman as well.  Instead of a rich, creamy dessert, we opted for one more round of shabu shabu.  It was an experience in itself. I can't wait to go back and to take others to be able to savor and smile as things explode on your taste buds.  Thanks for a great evening!",

I very much enjoyed the food selections including Sugar Snap Peas, Shasito Peppers, Kimchi, Scallops with Strawberry, Seared Tuna,  and Pork Belly.  The last being a must.. Our friends also ordered Sea Bass and clams.   My compliments to the chef as each dish had a nice unique taste that is not typical at other places.   The setting is very intimate being set in an very old historic home in downtown.   The portions are very small!!  And for me, this is disappointing.  Especially when you compare the price to the portion.  Now before anyone wants to respond, I acknowledge that this is about the experience.  And the food was excellent!!   But in these trying times, when I drop almost $100.00 for two for dinner, I at least want to walk out without feeling like I need to hit the closest fast food place.   I would go back.  This would be a great place for a quick appetizer type of start.  Go in, experience a couple of dishes that offer a nice fresh change in taste.  Then head out for dinner.    But not a regular type of place for me.  Go here for the atmosphere and experience.  Enjoy some different dishes that taste great.   But find a regular somewhere else.   P.S.  Located right next to Rose and Crown.  A nice tavern in a similar style house in the Heritage area.  Great locations for ballparks and convention center.",

The Nasu can be served without bacon if you are a vegetarian. We then moved on to the Yellowtail Ceviche and Shiromi Carpaccio.  The presentation of the Yellowtail was perfect and the Shiromi is a not to missed item. It was exceptional! We finished dinner with the Seabass and Mushrooms.   It was perfect for myself and my husband. He enjoyed the Seabass while I focused on the mushrooms.    Not only was the food great but the service was outstanding as well.  I am looking forward to returing to Nobuo in the very near future and bringing a few friends!",

The menu is pretty small for lunch which I appreciate makes it easier to choose.  My 2 year old I ordered the tofu tots for and he loved them.  The other kids ate these too and also really liked them.  My teenager and I both got the tofu salad with soba noodles I thought it was very yummy it had really fresh cucumber which gave it a refreshing crunch.  My 7 year old asked if he could get chicken and the waitress accommodated him with panko chicken and rice and a side salad.  He ate the whole thing and said it was, \"tasty\".  He also got a fun strawberry soda which you have to pop to open. My husband got the Daves curry he really enjoyed it. The waitress was very nice. I appreciated she allowed me to nurse my toddler and did not make me feel uncomfortable:) We had a great lunch.",

He told me later that I acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening.   My BAC was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption. We had already been waiting an hour and a half for Pizzeria Bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait.   While I wasn't making a spectacle of myself, we enjoyed the Teeter Tots and Steamed Pork Buns. Our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff.   The Teeter Tots, Panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce, were so good. I always look for a similar menu option at every Japanese place we go to now, but nothing has come close.   Now, I admit I do not normally like steamed pork buns. But I was drunk and in the mood for adventure, so I gave these guys a shot! Second best  outcome of an intoxicated decision ever!  Get frisky at Nubuo if you have the chance!",

    "text": "Nobuo combines unique, delectable dishes with an intimate, historic atmosphere. The setting is an old turn-of-the-century wooden house called the Teeter House. It's small, but there's darkness and mystery added to the atmosphere. The izakaya style of dining means that the dishes are tapas and are meant to be shared between those in your dining party. The experience at Nobuo is unlike any other dining experience I've ever had. The fact that it was a flawless experience with an atypical meal in an atypical setting makes me happy to award Nobuo with 5 stars.  I had late reservations at 9PM and wandered through Heritage Square to get to the Teeter House. I love the fact that the area is surrounded by historic houses built over a century ago. I love going to places with history, which is probably why I love New York and Boston so much. Heritage Square in Downtown Phoenix has converted historic houses into popular eateries. Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we waited outside on some comfy seats on the porch. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded eating our dinner out on the porch looking out into the square, but the tables and rooms inside enhance your experience here at Nobuo. When our table was ready, they came out to get us and they sat us inside right next to the front door with a window to the porch where we were just sitting. Since the restaurant is in a house, there were different rooms that diners could be seated in. The house had the one original restroom, which had a large sink and a new toilet that I'm sure isn't from the 1800's.   Our server was friendly and explained to us about the style of dining, izakaya, and that two people typically order 6 dishes. When we finally decided on what we wanted to order, we went with the following dishes:  -Kimchi ($6) - By no means was this traditional kimchi... it was even better! More like a salad than anything, but the taste was similar to kimchi. I think the sesame oil made the taste of traditional kimchi less intense, but at the same time even more delicious.  -Grapefruit & Hamachi ($14) - An interesting combination of sashimi, grapefruit, and avocado on four separate spoons. The white truffle ponzu oil and grapefruit gave this tasty treat its' bite. Our server told us that the dish was meant to eaten by the spoonful, as in, taken in one bite. The combination was so delicious that I wish they gave us more than four spoons.  -Yellowtail Ceviche ($14) - Boy, I feel dumb actually thinking that they would give us traditional ceviche. This dish was much like the Grapefruit & Hamachi in the way they were meant to be eaten. Four separate spoons with yellowtail, myouga, sesame seed, with shredded taro on top. It was amazingly exquisite and I can't even tell you whether the yellowtail ceviche or grapefruit & hamachi was better. They were both put together so well, each of them had their own creative and unique taste.  -Seabass & Mushroom ($14) - It came steamed in a neat little paper boat. The seabass was steamed to perfection and was surrounded by enoki mushrooms (I think) in a sake soy sauce. The seabass was good, but the mushrooms in the sake soy sauce made the dish even better.  -Pork Belly Wrapped in Banana Leaf ($14) - The Pork Belly and Rice came out baked inside the banana leaf. The rice was sticky and had a great flavor to it. It was the typical white rice and the pork belly wasn't typical either. It was good, but this wasn't my favorite dish of the night.  I must say that Nobuo is an experience I'll remember for a long time. I can't even remember that last time I was completely blown away by cuisine and atmosphere. The dishes are pricey, but expect to get a wonderful experience of divine cuisine with an unbeatable ambiance. If you're ever in Phoenix, you must try Nobuo at Teeter House.",

And the wait was rewarded for me on my recent jaunt to PHX.  Gone is the intimacy of watching the food smiths prepare all the dishes.  Instead, it's a lot of table seating with room for only four at the \"bar,\" which is really more like a chef's table considering Chef Nobuo creates his omakase menu back there.    However, it's less about the layout than the food here, and Sea Saw devotees won't be disappointed.  A lot of the faves are on the menu, with some new items thrown in.  Everything is good, but our must-haves on every visit are:  Pork belly buns Hamachi with grapefruit (the texture combo is INsane) Soft shell shrimp Soft shell crab Curry Lamb  We did notice they weren't serving a lot of sake.  In fact, I think we were the only table that did.  Which is too bad because Chef Nobuo has some bottles that you wouldn't be able to find in town.  I trust that he will stick to his guns by continuing to carry those labels, but I hope that more customers will support and encourage him to broaden the sake list.",

And expect the prices to be high for the small portions. Some of the fish dishes were pretty good.  I did take a taste of some duck, which I had never had before but will never have again.

What I would recommend, because of the cost, is that you make Nobu the focus of the evening because this place is designed for a long, lingering dinner, over several hours. One can certainly pick various small plate items but next time I go, I'm ordering the tasting menu.  The service is wonderful, the food is fresh and overall excellent...the only thing that stood as needing improvement was the duck breast, in one of the items, which was tougher than duck breast should be but everything else was wonderful. Based on the recommendation of my fellow yelpers, I did the Shochu flight and sipped them slowly and yes, that is worth ordering.   I also like that the restaurant is located in a classic old house and in Japan, during the Edo period (I went to Japan this year and learned all about the Edo period, so forgive me), the homes were also made out of wood so it is sort of a connection back to classic Japanese architecture.  You'll pay for the experience here but if you have the cash, definitely worth it!",

First this place is very small with several small rooms in a historic house. The decor and the house is worth the trip to the restaurant alone.   After looking over the menu and checking our other fellow yelpers we decided on a total of 4 items. We started with the Grapefruit & Hamachi,.  I was simply amazed how good this was! I really do not like grapefruit but this was mouth watering. We then tried the Big-Eye Tuna Tataki and again it was amazing. The tuna was seared to perfection.  Then we moved to the Seabass & Mushroom.  I'm not fond of mushrooms but I found myself eating as much as I could. It was paired wonderfully with the steamed seabass. Finally we went with pork belly with rice. Simply amazing again!  This was a wonderful experience. Dining took us just about 1 1/2 hours so it is a total dining experience. I really did like Nobuo. The only reason I'm giving it 4 star is because total for the 4 items and a tea was about $75 with tip. A little pricy. I left satisfied but could have eaten some more for sure!  Anyways I would return here for a special occasion. I wish Yelp would allow me to rate this as 4 1/2 stars.",

    "text": "First I gotta get something out of my system: you people giving bad reviews on this place need to get a grip. Nobuo is not your spot if you want to get in and out quick before a concert. Nobuo is a destination in itself. Diners need to allow enough time to appreciate the flawless execution of each dish in turn. And there is no division on the menu between \"starters\" and \"mains.\" Yes, dishes are served individually, in succession, tapas-style, choose your descriptor. No, you can't whine that your \"main\" came out after your dining companion's \"main.\" Yes, eating here takes time. If you do not have that time, go somewhere else. But if you do have that time, you will be richly rewarded. I keep using the word \"perfect\" in this review because there is simply no other word to use.  Hubby and I enjoyed a definite splurge Saturday night with five dishes. #1: the grapefruit and hamachi, which is as fantastic as all the other reviewers say. I could eat it all day long and never get sick of it (but never get full either - it is very light, and the portion borders on a taste). #2: a special that day, tuna with charred greens and an onion vinaigrette. The tuna was seared on the outisde, raw on the inside, and simply melted in our mouths. #3: the warm duck salad, with a roughly equivalent portion of greens to the previous dish, but a slightly larger portion of duck, again expertly crafted. This is the first duck dish I've ever been served where I had no desire to try to peel back and discard portions - it was perfect and we practically licked the plate. #4: coconut curry lamb, perfectly trimmed, delicately but richly spiced, with the clean, sharp and sweet flavors of the mango fennel salad setting off the rich lamb perfectly. #5: the shiromi carpaccio, fanned slices of white fish over which the server pours hot oil to cook the fish right at your table. The \"focaccia\" was more of a spiced steamed bread, and I wished we'd had a bit more of it, but we really didn't need more: the portion brought was exactly right to sop up the majority of the delicious ginger, yuzu, sesame and garlic sauce while leaving behind most of the cooking oil.   Drinks: Hubby had a sweet potato lager, which was interesting, but nothing I would go out of my way to order again. I enjoyed my first exposure to shochu, ordering the potato flight. My favorite, the white potato, reminded me of grappa; I can see why people compare shochu to single-malt whisky.  Bottom line: I could drop my finger on the menu and order absolutely any dish, and I have no doubt it would arrive to my table expertly crafted, with great attention to flavor and detail, at the height of its perfection. We paid dearly for that perfection; even with a $50 for $100 Deal Chicken deal, this was a real wallet-buster at $70 per person with tax and tip. But it was worth it. For an anniversary or other special evening, I can think of no better celebratory splurge.",

    "text": "Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service.  Nobou at Teeter House offers up a very pleasurable dining experience.  I'll start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someone's home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful.   The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldn't have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Don't get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didn't have that over-the-top \"WOW\" factor I was hoping for.  Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  It's an enjoyable place to eat.  It's probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer.  As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2F%3Fref%3D19485&s=69a1a1431c979d06d7819b315842bea4640a3a14b91eea41c717e79a200f8c77\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/?ref=19485</a>) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.  Take advantage of the deal and cross Nobuo off your Phoenix restaurant bucket list.",

Since the restaurant used to a house it's very cozy intimate.  Our server was really nice and explained the menu to us and gave us a rundown of the specials.   We got:  Teeter Tots-these were incredible.  I usually don't like tofu but there wasn't any of that funky tofu taste and the texture was perfect.  They're a total bargain for $6.00 a serving.  Yellow tail ceviche-The yellow tail was amazing but I found the citrus to be a little too strong for my taste.  House cured salmon-This was by far my favorite, I could have eaten two plates of it alone.  The salmon was perfect, the basil oil was delicious and the soy glazed almonds added a perfect crunch.  They should consider offering the soy glazed almonds on their own, they were absolutely delicious.  The sashimi special of Kanpachi-It was really good, it kind of reminded me of himachi with a little bit of a firmer texture.  Their wasabi is also really good.  Soft shell crab salad-this was my husband's favorite.  The crab was cooked perfectly and the salad it was served on was delicious and a perfect foil to the crab.  The only issue was when you got down to the bottom of the salad the citrus dressing was a little overwhelming.  The tofu chocolate mousse-This was delicious!  I loved the candied orange they served it with and if the waiter hadn't told us I would have never known there was tofu in it.  They serve it with green tea ice cream.  Neither my husband nor I much cared for the green tea ice cream but it's nothing against them we're just not green tea fans.  The orange fritters-This was one of the best desserts I've had in a long time.  The fritters were amazing.  They weren't greasy and tasted divine.  I think it was served on a red bean caramel which was insane.  We cleaned the plate and were fighting over it!  It also came with a scoop of jasmine tea ice cream which was unbelievably good.    Even though I wasn't a huge fan of all the dishes I'm still giving them 5 stars and this is why.  The service was impeccable.  Usually when you go to a restaurant like this that serves food in waves the timing is really bad, but their timing was PERFECT.  We never waited more than a couple of minutes for the next wave of food to come to our table after we were done with a dish.  A couple of times the next dish came out within seconds of finishing.",

    "text": "Everyone should experience a meal like this at least once in their lifetime. I went with a group of 5 for dinner and ordered 9 food dishes, 2 kinds of beer, and a delightful bottle of sake. If you're doing family style I would recommend splitting dishes between 2-4 people. Most things came out as 6 or 8 small pieces so it would be nice to have a few bites from each plate. My 2 absolute favorites are the Grapefruit & Hamachi dish, and the Shiromi Carpaccio (that comes with house-made focaccia). If I had to choose a meal to eat for the rest of my life, it would be one of those 2. Absolutely divine (I never use that word...but it's certainly fitting in this case). My next 2 favorites were the Oyster with uni, tomato water, and wasabi oil, and the Today's vegetable option (I have no idea what plant it was, but there was a particularly delicious crunchy leaf that we all fought over). The tuna tataki, clam & mushroom, and soft shell crab salad were all fantastic and savory as well. The Saikyo Yaki was a bit unremarkable, but maybe it was just hard to split 2 orders of it between 5 people - I only had a small bite. And finally, the dessert! A sweet pureed concoction in a mason jar with the consistency of baby food was the perfect ending to a perfect meal. Yes, it's a pricey experience but it is worth it for a memorable date or celebratory meal. Our total came out to $80 a person and we all walked out with a smile, discussing all our favorite tastes. Thanks to our personable server who was patient, attentive, and lively! I would love to return for the omakase or tasting menu (call 2 weeks ahead for omakase and 24 hours ahead for the tasting menu!). This is definitely the type of place you want to call beforehand and make a reservation (shout-out to the patient person who answered the phone and dealt with my indecisiveness). The location is picturesque and the house is charming. In regards to parking, look for the Cultural Center Parking Garage and your server will validate your parking pass. Thanks for the lovely evening!",

    "text": "Nobuo at Teeter House This restaurant focuses on quality. Plain and simple. Their ingredients are of very high quality and their recipes are simple, yet have a flair of creativity. The debate on whether the cost is worth the quality is debatable in my opinion. I wish I could get more dishes but unfortunately, I am not made of money.  Taste  Vegetable Medley- The waitress said that the chef pretty much does anything and presents it to the customers. A square dish is presented to your party with each of the four corners dolloped with a contrasting set of vegetables and in the middle, a salad. I chose this dish because I love surprises and I like it when a chef has free reign on what to do and it shows the True essence of the restaurant. This was about $14.00  On the north side was a bisected snow peas with peanut sauce and bonito flakes. I thought the savoriness of the bonito flakes enhanced the peanut sauce very well and the snop peas were blanched to perfection.  The east has a grilled blanched Brussel sprout with a pungent wasabi honey sauce. I love it when restaurants cooked Brussel sprouts just right and they definitely got it down to a science. The sauce was a spicy wasabi which took me by surprise.  The south, an unpronounceable Asian vegetable that was dried in the oven. It literally tastes like kale chips. The color is very bright for a dried vegetable so it makes me believe that they actually probably fried it without any coating. The fast yet high heat really brings out the color of the vegetable and enhances the flavor. Like a kale chip, the leafy crisp dissolves in your mouth. The west was lined with yellow and red cherry tomatoes with a mirin based sweet sauce. Sprinkled were bits of tomato. It was a nice, summary yet refreshing dish, but wasn't my favorite.  And the center was a watermelon radish salad with a sour vinaigrette. Though it seemed pretty cool, I found the essence of the vegetable missing (maybe the vegetable actually has no flavor) and was met with pretty much a wet sponge of vinegrette.  Oyster with Sea Urchin- For about $16.00, you get two shelled sea urchins and oysters on a spoon. The two contrasting sea foods are then drizzled with a spicy wasabi oil. I shot these down which I kind of regret because the wasabi hit me in the face. I'm not a huge connosouer when it comes to sea urchins because I feel like they taste like salty sea water bags. The raw oyster reminds me of the oens I had in New Orelans, it had that aoiunt of freshness.  Soft Shell Crab Salad -The waitress said that this dish is the most popular. At $20.00 a plate, this is a big dish in Nobuo's standard. You get a pretty big plate with a quartered deep fried soft shelled crab. Below the crab is some spongy rice noodles and a lot of cucumber and onions. The sauce is particularily sour and tastes like mirin. The peanuts are garnished around the plate giving it a nice crunch if you can get it on your chopsticks. The blue crab was excellent but I found the salad to be average. The dressing, which covered the bottom of the plate (for decoration) was too acidic for me and I was sad I couldn't get any peanuts in my bites.  Ambiance  Nobuo's a small, cramped restaurant just like many of the Heritage Square restaurants but I feel that's what give sit its charm. Overall, the atmosphere does not fit the quality of the food. Maybe it's too much time at the Rose and Crowns, but I felt like I was eating at a British pub. It didn't help that we were sitting in front of the entrance.  If you have big party, Nobuo actually has a huge and well decorated party room. The ambiance of the room is a calm, aqua blue with Japanese decor such as a portrait of a geisha. If you ever had to impress a business with business men who like food and a little bit of culture, this is the perfect room to pelase your cilents. With the price of food, that will also please them as well.  Cost About $60.00 will give you a complete meal. Depending on if you eat cheap or expensive, add or subtract $20 dollars. The waitress suggested having us try 3 more dishes because the average number of dishes for 2 people is 6 dishes. As much as I'd like to pay that much, I don't.  If you have the money and are a complete food snob, then go for buying as much as you want. However, with my budget, I could only afford 3 dishes for my date and I.  Selection Like all simple Japanese inspired restaurants, Nobuo's menu is very simple and their items involves a name and the ingredients used in the bottom. The drinks list is longer than the menu, which is about two pages long and lists cocktails, beers, and wine. A hint: The filling dishes are the crab salad and the banana leaf pork.  Overall",

First, the restaurant is in what looks like an old, historic house (it's because it is!). Don't be fooled though, the service and food here is superb.   Here are my thoughts on what we ate:   Grapefruit & Hamachi -- by far my favorite of what we ate; the citrus from the grapefruit (with the slight sweetness) accentuated the hamachi perfectly Yellow Tail Ceviche -- a close second; incredibly refreshing and I loved the texture/crunch of the taro Pork Belly Wrapped in Banana Leaf -- if i had to pick the thing I liked the least, it was this one; it was the biggest and most family style of what we ordered but I think we should've stayed with the seafood; in no way though, was this a regret of an order!  Soft Shell Crab Salad -- delicious, succulent soft shell crab; you could taste the hint of the fish sauce, which was a nice ode to my south asian roots  If you're in Phoenix and need a good place to eat, come here. Prices are $$$ but in reality, if you were willing to treat yourself and you like seafood and Asian flavors, here's the place to do it!",

    "text": "Sadly, I didn't even have an opportunity to dine here. Today we arrived at 5:30, the restaurant had just opened and there was one other couple waiting on the patio. The restaurant was completely empty and upon entering the beautiful historic building a hostess looked at us, no greeting, no good evening, just a long glance and asked if we had reservations. I informed her that we did not. She then walked away to ask a man whose name is \"Chris\"  ( I learned his name by calling and giving his description) a question. He comes over and quickly says they are completely booked for the entire night and shrugged us off. He could've offered to put us on a waiting list should there be a cancellation (restaurant is empty), he could've recommended we come back another day. Nope, he showed a lack of professionalism, lack of interest and only cared about chit-chatting with the hostess about personal stuff and quickly went back to engaging in personal chatter whilst staring at their cell phones. Did I mention the restaurant was empty? After looking at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a>, turns out they did have several reservations available! Thanks a lot Mr. Chris and gracious hostess for turning my husband and me away. My first impressions based from the first interactions upon entering this establishment were poor and for that reason my rating is one star. Sidenote; when I called to speak with  \"Mr. Chris\" regarding the reservation availability  on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpentable.com&s=e2215de09505b8fbf3a047b68af38708cbc8b52c843ab34faaecc46b3704d557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opentable.com</a>, I was placed on hold by the hostess for over 27 minutes. Screenshots are of hold time and the Open Table reservation.",

Lunch was overall very good, though I don't feel like the high prices are quite justified.    Short ribs salad was soaked in dressing, and I would have preferred roasted short rib to medium-rare steak style, which was a little tough.  But overall it was well balanced and delicious.  Katsu curry chicken was really good, kimchi had a great spicy kick to it.  I would definitely order it again. Okonomiyaki was very much enjoyed by my husband, he liked that they weren't afraid to use lots of squid.  Service was a little slow, don't recommend to go if you're in a hurry. But they did check up on us several times.  Everything was fresh and light. If you are really hungry, plan on ordering more than one dish.",

    "text": "I'll tell you a little later how Restaurant managed to serve me the tastiest food but yet was able to disappoint me at the end, but first, let me tell you about how I met the world's nicest server on this evening.  I took my fiance to this great restaurant for his birthday. Reservations were made ahead. We were seated and the fun has begun. Our server was such a refreshment. He was polite, knowledgeable, personable, funny, and more.... We decided to go with a tasting menu and he was sure to explain to us of what we should expect. Overall, the service was great and it is almost comparable to first-class service of French Laundry :-)   The ambiance was very zen like. This restorante is great for special occasions.  They only have 8 tables. Very intimate and personable historic, two bedroom house in downtown Phoenix. The place is really easy to find as it seats right across from famos Pizzeria Bianco.   They are open 7 days a week but I highly recommend that reservations are made prior your visitation as they are really small and popular place. They start serving dinner at 5PM and are open for lunch from 11am to 2pm.    Both of us really enjoyed the food very much as it took us to Japan and opened up our palette. My favorite were sashimi's for which, I am definitely going back :-)   The only catch to this evening was that I did find a little bit odd that they didn't do anything special for the birthday boy. He was served the same desert as i got without a single candle or any acknowledgment of his special day. When I originally called to make the reservations, I was advised that they do something little for b-day guests but I must say we got nothing.   For me, it is not about the free desert, I can pay for that - it just the principal. It would of been nice to get at least a candle for such a special occasion, especially at pace where one drops over $300 for dinner for two :-)  We are definitely going back and highly recommend this place to those with deep pockets ;-)",

    "text": "Every once in awhile, if you are very lucky, you will enjoy a meal that is truly noteworthy and which will be a long time in your memory. A meal in which you can recall each of the flavors and how it enhanced the meal. Eating at Nobuo was such an experience.  Companion and I visited Nobuo during Restaurant Week, and had an outstanding experience and meal. Our waiter, David helped create such a wonderful experience that I haven't come down from all the smiling I did yet!  We were seated promptly at a fairly sparse table, set in what I would call traditional tones. A candle, two black rocks, and two glasses of water.  Companion started off with a bottle of Ramune, a strawberry flavored drink bottled in Japan. I started off with a glass of Junmai Ginjo Hakkaisan sake. It was as good as anything I had while I was in Japan, and had beautiful legs as in a fine wine. I should mention the amazing assortment of Japanese beers on the menu. I last saw this big an assortment in Tokyo.  As a prix fixe menu, there are still a number of choices available, though not the usual amount that one would see on the regular menu.   Companion ordered some Hamachi, which is an optional extra on the back of the menu. The fish just melted on your tongue and was obviously from a premium fish. I ordered stuffed squash blossoms from the extra menu, and dare I say, they were much better than the ones I make. Perhaps it was the streak of curry powder on the plate that one could dip the blossom into. I don't really know except that it was delicious.  Next came Bento Boxes. Both companion and I had boxes with salad and with cold rice that I think was marinated in a yuzu vinaigrette. While I am not much for eating cold rice, in this case an exception had to be made. The rice was perfectly cooked and the vinaigrette seemed to play with your palate while you ate it.   Companions Bento Box contained 3 different types of fish including one that was cooked en papillote, where the fish is placed in a parchment packet and then baked until tender and moist. Companion deemed it to be one of the best pieces of fish she had ever eaten, though there was no sign of herbs which are usually used in this preparation.   My Bento Box was a meat preparation which included some short rib slices, pork belly on a Chinese steam bun, and a most wonderful preparation of chicken with a sauce that was sheer perfection. Though I was totally full, I was sad that I hadn't tried a bit of everything on the menu.  Last was dessert. In Japan, dessert is usually a piece of fresh fruit if anything, but in this case Nobuo gave a nod to American eating habits and provided actual desserts but with a Japanese twist. Companion had a deconstructed dessert consisting of several sorbet/ice cream combinations including a True matcha green tea ice cream which totally cleansed the palate. For myself, I had a sesame pudding with sweet almonds and a bit of a cookie. It was smooth and tasty with a flavor of sesame that was perfect and not overpowering.  I would be remiss if I did not mention David, our waiter. He was available anytime we had a need, and carefully explained each dish to us as it was presented. A good waiter can make or break a meal, and it this case, he made it happen.  5 stars for outstanding food, great service, and excellent cleanliness",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Thank you, Chef Fukuda, for not doing just a sushi joint in the Valley.  Thank you opening people's eyes to the fact that Japanese food is not just sushi (not even close).  And thank you for doing interesting and modern interpretations of that same Japanese cuisine.  This place can get a little pricey.  All those little dishes can add up.  But the nigiri he serves has been excellent, many of the dishes inventive, and for the most part, quite well-balanced.  Came here for lunch once and got the pork belly buns and the Soft shell crab sandwich.  The pork belly buns are fine, David Chang's of Momofuku are clearly better.  But these are tasty enough.  The soft shell crab is large and well fried, not too wet, with a nice crunch.  This was also a tasty sandwich.  My wife and I have tried almost everything on the dinner menu.  The Grapefruit and hamachi is a standout dish - subtle and delicious.  My wife was also pleasantly surprised by the tako and tomato.  The hassun plate includes the Teeter tots, and I'm a sucker for those.  (Tofu fried tots, quite tasty.)    The steamed clams are steamed in sake and you can definitely smell it - the broth is delicious from the clam juice and bacon and sake.  The seabass and mushroom, every time we've ordered it, has been a tad salty.  The texture is pretty perfect, just a tad over-seasoned.  The warm duck salad is also quite good.  We have yet to try Chef Fukuda's omakase experience, but will do so soon and I'll update then.  In the mean time, this James Beard Award-winning chef deserves much praise for his casual fine dining establishment in the little house.",

There was no one else in the restaurant at all (should have been my first clue).  The glass beaker on every table had stagnant water and dead flowers (second clue).  The waitress seemed annoyed by our questions and I was unsure what I would be getting.  The very loud music was 50s style so I asked for the sound to be turned down and was hoping for Asian music, which she complied with.  The food was AWFUL!  My meat was too well done but my friend's was too rare (we traded), the braised pork belly was a tiny bit of meat and the rest was fat.  The mackerel was dry, bland, and needed salt badly, which I asked for.  The waitress said she was not allowed to bring me salt because the recipes can not be changed AT ALL!  The chef must be so full of himself that his customers do not matter.  Our bill was over $70 and we were hungry when we left.  I will NEVER eat there again!!!",

I had the garden gimlet.  It was on the sweeter side, which I prefer.  But not overly sweet.  It was quiet subtle.   We ordered the deep fried squid balls.  That's not what they were called, but it's an accurate description.  They were okay.  We also the tako and tomato and the grapefruit and hamachi.  Loved them both! Always have!  We also ordered the other special.  It was a whole fish sashimied. Once you finish the sashimi, they take the bones and deep fry them so you can eat them!  Very interesting.  Our final dish, we ordered on a whim.  It was the clams and the mushrooms.  By far, the best dish of the night!  It comes in some sort of plastic wrapping.  The broth was insanely fragrant and it tasted better than it smelled.  The mushrooms were perfect.  I could eat this dish every day.   Service was great.  I forgot my blazer and one of their staff chased me around the corner to return it.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience.",

    "text": "To celebrate my daughter's birthday this year, we did our traditional \"pick a new restaurant\" and we chose Nobuo At Teeter House.  I placed a lunch reservation for seven through Open Table and requested something \"sweet\" for my daughter at the end of the meal.    We were shown to a room where some tables were put together to accommodate our group.  First, the atmosphere is very relaxing and neutral, which we loved.  None of us drink wine, in which they have an extensive wine and spirits list,  so we were limited to teas.  I would like to note that most of us were not used to drinking hot or cold tea without sugar, and the restaurant does not have sugar packets to sweeten the tea.  However, our server was fantastic, she brought over a light sweetened mixture of liquid honey to use.  I must say that without all the sugar, the fragrance and natural taste of the tea could be appreciated.  I tried the Grapefruit & Hamachi to start with and it was delicious and light; not overpowering and beautifully presented.  We all ordered different dishes for the most part.  Two of us, including me, had Okonomiyaki.  Absolutely delicious!  Each bite was yummy heaven and a delicate blend of tastes.  My daughter agreed, once she got over the fact that the shavings of smoked fish were not moving because they were alive but from the heat of the pancakes.  :-)  Two others had the Panko-Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, which I was told was alright but not great.  I tasted a piece for myself and it was not on the same level of deliciousness as the rest of the dishes.  Another dish that two of us in the group ordered was Dave's Chicken Katsu Curry.  I didn't taste it but I was told it was absolutely delicious and they wished there was more.  I can attest to both of them cleaning their plates, which is always a great sign of yumminess.  My grand-daughter who is four, had the Pork Belly Buns, which was suggested by the server since they do not have a menu with kid-friendly items.  However, she only had one bite before we were asking if she would share a nibble with us.  We figured it must be good because her face went from skeptical to smiling and gave it a thumbs up.  We had to order her one \"to go\" because we ended up eating all of her food.  The Pork Belly Buns looks like a raw bun folded over to resemble a taco.  However, do not underestimate the flavorful taste bud experience by not ordering it because it looks funny.    Dessert for the birthday girl was a tart made with a shortbread crust with homemade whipped cream and a sweet berry sauce.  I do not remember the name but the flavor was mild and with the cream and sauce, made it a nice treat.  This is definitely a place that is worth trying out if you want to taste something other than the Americanized version of sushi, etc.  I will definitely be back and will not wait for a family celebration to be the reason to visit again.  As a matter of fact, I am about to make a reservation for one for next week.",

After eventually finding the Teeter House, we found the trip to be well worth it. The food was excellent! Service -- top notch! However, this is not your mom-and-pop Japanese diner. This is a quiet, quaint, spot for a special meal -- but not because of the cost, mind you. The prices are very reasonable. Although the dishes are not enormous, five guys left there very content for less than $30 pp total. Every dish was superb in taste and presentation. There was nothing that I wouldn't order again in a heartbeat. In fact, it'll be hard to go back and try something new because you will want to re-live some of those unique flavors again and again.

First off, LOVED the location and atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is in an old house, which seems quaint and unique.  They have fire pits and some good seating outside, which we both remarked would be cool if it were warmer.  Considering it was a cold winter evening in December, we opted to sit inside.  Nobuo, as I am sure you can tell from the previous reviews, is a tapas-like Japanese restaurant featuring hot and cold small plates.  After reading the very helpful reviews on yelp, we sampled the following items: tofu tatter tots, chopped salad, pork buns, halibut, and the fritters.  With that lineup of items, what's not to like... the highlights for me were the tofu tater tots, which had such a unique texture and the sauce was amazing (and I hate tofu).  The pork buns were AH-MAZ-ING!  I could have ordered two of those and been a very happy girl.  The dessert was fabulous and capped off an amazing meal so well.  All in all, I was SOOOO... happy with the meal and this place is a True gem.  Oh, and they pour a REALLY stiff drink!  We left our meal excited for our next time back to Nobuo, which tells you all you need to know in my opinion.",

Favorite dish was the Shiromi Carpachio.    REMEMBER: Eating here is more of an experience than a meal.  It is about tasting food like one tastes wine.  You don't go here to fill your belly.    You come here to tantalize your senses.  If you remember this.  You will be happy with your experience.    Cornerstone of any Japanese food involves raw fish in a big way.  Of course there are other dishes too, but I didn't eat any of those.

    "text": "I liked the sound of this place from what I read online, but then was forced virtually at knifepoint to actually visit. Turns out, by sharing descriptions of the food with my Korean co-worker, he could not accept any substitute for lunch that day. We simply HAD to try the steamed buns with pork belly and braised short ribs!  So we braved the blast furnace of the downtown Phoenix midday summer heat and traipsed through Heritage Square to the tranquility of Nobuo at Teeter House. We were not disappointed. The steamed buns here were actually flatter than one might expect and used to envelope the perfectly seasoned meats as a kind of Japanese taco. Pickled celery salad made a perfect palate cleanser, and helped me to appreciate the differences between the flavors of the pork belly versus the braised short ribs. I also had a refreshing iced oolong tea with hibiscus to go with my meal.   My only wish is that we would've ordered another pair of steamed buns and split them between the two of us, because we wolfed down these delicious goodies awfully quick. However, 20 minutes later, my stomach got the message that I was actually full, even though I originally thought the portions weren't quite enough. Must be the magic of the steamed bun.  I'm eager to try out the rest of the menu here because the experience was memorable and the food, mouth-wateringly good. Never underestimate the power of umami! A welcome oasis of serenity and deliciousness awaits you at Nobuo.",

    "text": "Don't miss the new @NobuoAtTeeter headed by James Beard award winner Nobuo Fukuda formerly of Sea Saw Restaurant. Teeter House feels like a cozy home with separate seating areas and a 4-seater bar shared between a full alcohol bar and Nobuo's prep area.   We sat at the bar right in front of Nobuo and were entertained the whole night by his artistic preparation of what I would call new-style sashimi, along the same vein as what Crudo is doing in Scottsdale - small plates of fresh raw seafood dressed with flavored oils and local in-season fruits and vegetables. Each dish excited the palate with creative combinations of flavors, textures and temperatures, such as the Hirame Carpaccio topped with hot sesame oil at the table.  Unfortunately we missed the other side of the menu and will have to wait until next time to try the warm dishes. Although based on the mizuyokan we had for dessert, I am sure the kitchen puts out equally excellent food. The mizuyokan, a red bean pastry held together by gelatin or agar agar, had a velvety texture (a little firmer than panna cotta) and a perfect level of sweetness (less sweet than the cloyingly sweet versions I've had in Japan).  The restaurant is located right across from fellow James Beard award-winner Chris Bianco's pizzeria and open everyday except Monday for lunch and dinner.",

The place is a small historic home renovated and sits just across from Pizzeria Bianco.  The evening was $15 and we sampled everything on the menu. Is was a full house and the food kept coming. The servers passed Asian Hors'd ouvres to our tables. Every bite was succulent with the freshest of the fresh. A piece of salmon wrapped around a very special little almond drizzled with a unique basil sauce. Pork buns that melted. A square of watermelon with cap of goat cheese, refreshing ! I absoulutely loved the tasting and can't wait to go back for dinner ! This cuisine if something out of the ordinary and very SPECIAL ! This is fine dining in a cool hip place !",

Parking is a pain though.  However.....  Besides feeling hip, cool, urban and trendy; I also felt hungry and ripped off after leaving.  Sure, I could sit there for hours sipping saki and trying every one of their tapas and probably be ok hunger-wise but  I would NOT be ok with the $100+ tab per person that it would surely be.  For me this is more of a fun/interesting place to go before you go out to dinner.",

We came for lunch and it was so good we came back for dinner! Both times we sat outside in the lovely, modern garden (which supplied chef with fresh herbs like lemon grass, yuzu and shiso leaf). Inside looked super cute too - lovely restored 1899 building with great wallpaper.  Some of the deliciousness: - Tako age (fried octopus with a spicy yuzu aioli) - Shiromi Cevich (gorgeous bundles of miyoga with shredded taro) - Grapefruit Hamachi (with avocado and truffle oil served in soup spoons) - Warm Duck Salad with a gorgeous pile of grilled greens (so good we order a second side of them and got the recipe from the chef) - Okonomiyaki (street food, pork and seafood pancake with more of that yummy japanese mayo)  Don't forget the elegant summery cocktails, I had three: - Cucumber shiso (vodka, rose water and cucumber) - White Drago Jasmine - the BEST, a combo og gin, vermouth, jasmine tea and chamomile lemongrass syrup. Not too sweet. So refreshing - Road to Nowhere - more of a dude drink, but tasty. Couldn't finish this one.  Excellent service both visits. Especially liked how friendly, laid-back everyone was. Even the chef came out to say hi - an incredibly talented, yet so unassuming fellow - and filled our water glasses.  A suberb meal, both visits. I highly, highly recommend Nobuo.",

Menu was exquisite, modern, creative Japanese tapas....try the grilled Shishito Pepper with bonito flakes....really nice starter with a bit of a kick.  Tako and Tomato dish (grilled octopus with house-made mozz and tomator water) was really special.  It's not a huge serving but man, each bite is perfect, served in a little spoon.  I found the pork belly buns to be good, but the belly was a bit too chewy and the sauce overpowered the subtle flavors of the pork.  The buns were so well made though that I still rate this place a 5.  Finished with chocolate tofu mousse with green tea ice cream and some nice green tea....  Ambiance is Japanese modern chique in what looks to be a big spacious house from the 30s.  Good ambient music, good service, and phenomenal saki/wine list.    Altogether a great find in one of my least favorite cities in the country (sorry Phoneix....come visit Austin!).  I'll be back.",

Absolutely heavenly.The slightly overcooked lobster and  raman noodles were good too but disappointing by comparison . I could take or leave the sweetly marinated black cod, but wifey loved it. The wine menu is limited and not all the wines listed were present for consumption. Spirits are limited...no whiskey and one bourbon label. Specialty drinks are nothing special. The beers are Japanese only.  I ordered by bottle size. The 22oz. bottle won. The ambiance is plain, with small noisy rooms and no wall decor. Where is the ambiance that people are writing about?  Old house, small rooms, lots of tables, painted plasterboard. Gee, how quaint.  I can cook with generous amounts of sesame oil and fresh ginger too, but there really are some savory dishes to be enjoyed here.  Is it worth the $$$$?  I think for a very special occasion or date, that it is.  There is a parking garage around the corner. Get your ticket validated by your server.",

Anyways, my husband and I and another couple decided to try Teeter House last night. I have been wanting to try it for months, so I was totally excited. We got there early on a Friday night and were seated right away.  We basically ordered everything on the menu and all the food was awesome! We had to order double of some items because the portion size is a little small considering there were four of us!  My favorites were the snap peas, sea bass, grapefruit and hamachi, and the tofu mousse!! Also, they have a great drink menu.  Already planning a trip back :)",

We can tell that it must have taken several days to source the ingredients and prepare the dinner; we gladly paid the bill knowing how much work must have gone into making the dishes. The food was creative, fresh, and delicious.  We've dined at many wonderful restaurants around the world, but the chef still managed to surprise us with great flavors that we'd never tasted before. Our favorites included marinated salmon eggs (firm, fresh, and they pop like no other salmon eggs we've ever had), chicken done in three ways, corn tempura (surprisingly delicate), oysters with uni, and a fantastic ice cream and cookie dessert that had us scraping the bottom of the bowls.  The service was warm and attentive.  Thank you, chef!",

    "text": "The Omakase dinner I had here in early December for my birthday is a meal I will remember for years. I've eaten at two restaurants with three Michelin stars (Paul Bocuse and Le Petit Nice), and at Minibar in Washington, DC. The Omakase by Chef Nobuo was every bit as enjoyable and life changing as those places. It's been about a month, and I can still imagine and remember the taste of each dish in detail. Our Omakase had 9 courses, many consisting of several items:  1. Cold appetizer of radish salad and edamame in sesame sauce 2. Hot appetizer of fried fingerling potatoes with bonito flakes, and fried octopus ball 3. Two chawanmushi, one cold flavored with fish and house made ikura, one hot flavored with foie gras. 4. Sashimi plate with 9 completely different items (took over 30 minutes for Chef Nobuo to assemble this one course) 5. Wagyu beef grilled over charcoal with miso sauce 6. Shabu Shabu of red snapper and mushrooms 7. Red snapper soup (made with Shabu Shabu broth) 8. Taiwanese Oolong tea service 9. Dessert of orange mousse, grapefruit sorbet with shiso, and a chocolate custard.  Everything was made by Chef Nobuo (by himself) right in front of your eyes. We ordered a very good sake from their extensive sake menu to accompany the meal. I would have liked it if they had offered a sake flight as an option to the meal, but the bottle we had was great. The only downside to the meal was cost: $400 for two people including the drinks, tax and tip. Not that I think it wasn't worth it or was a bad value, though. It was worth every dime, and given the amount of time and effort it took to serve just 4 customers, a perfectly reasonable value. It's also in line with the cost of the places I mentioned in the beginning of the review. I just wish I could go more often. As it stands, I'll be lucky if I can afford once a year.",

    "text": "Nobuo at Teeter House was my first meal in Phoenix. I was directed to this restaurant from reviews rating it as \"5-star cuisine\". After all, the owner Nobuo Fukada from Tokyo received the acclaimed James Beard Award in 2007.   When I arrived at exactly 5pm, the servers were probably amused to see me. The restaurant was completely empty. As I walked in, several servers were just arriving on their shift! Without hesitation, they seated me in a private wood-floored historic bungalow room and presented a two page tapa menu.  The servers were polite. I did not encounter anyone Japanese in the restaurant, with the exception of chef Nobuo Fukada. Apparently, Nobuo is not a traditional Japanese restaurant. It is an izakaya-style eatery with heavy American influences in the dishes (think creative east-meets-west Japanese). The dinner menu consisted of 4 appetizers, 8 cold dishes, and 9 warm dishes with prices ranging from $6 to $26.  Due to the high cost of each dish, I was only able to order 2 tapas. I selected the two most popular dishes:  1. GRAPEFRUIT AND HAMACHI ($16) This cold dish consists of 4 thick slices of hamachi (albacore) sashimi gently brushed with white truffle ponzu oil. A thin slice of ginger was applied on top. Each piece of hamachi was wrapped with a slice of avocado and a piece of grapefruit. The citrus ingredients complemented the hamachi. They were served creatively on single-bit spoons.  2. WARM DUCK SALAD ($16) A duck salad sounds ordinary but it was prepared with precision that exceeded my standards. It was a hearty warm dish. About 5 to 6 slices of warm duck were served with a bed of grilled greens. The duck was lightly pan seared to create crispy edges. Then, a soy and zinfandei marinade reduction was applied to create a succulent flavor. Although the grilled vegetables can be dry, it can be dipped in the yuzu vinaigrette. This dish exhibited a satisfying variety of texture - crispy and juicy (duck), crunchy (grilled onions and peppers), chewy (grilled greens).  Although the dishes at Nobuo were artfully crafted, thoughtful, and prepared with superb seasonal ingredients, like most small plate restaurants, the overall value was borderline poor. Perhaps lunch is more appropriate here than dinner. My dinner exceeded $40 including tax and tip, but my stomach was not full after 2 tapas. After this meal, I had to drive to CherryBlossom in Phoenix for a second meal.  Try Nobuo if $$$$ or a budget is not an issue. Come with a large group of 4 to 6 and splurge on the various tapas.",

    "text": "Just astounding!! On our way back to El Paso from California, we stopped at Phoenix to get some lunch. We saw this restaurant on Yelp and considering I love Japanese food we decided to stop.   The restaurant looks like a small cozy house. We were seated quickly and the waitress/hostess was very nice.   As an appetizer we ordered a sashimi which came in four little scoops meant to be eaten in one bite. As soon as I put it inside my mouth, a burst of flavor exploded inside it. Spicy, sweet, fresh, bitter, and savory all mixed into one.   For entree my party ordered a shrimp salad (I forgot the name of the dish), Okonomiyaki, and a Chicken Catsu Curry. I got the chance to try both the Okonomiyaki (which was the plate I ordered) and the Chicken Catsu Curry. The Okonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake. Mine had shrimp, Japanese mayo, and eel sauce as well as an assortment of other veggies and herbs. The other entree was very delicious as well. The chicken was breaded and lightly fried and it created a wonderful sensation when combined with the white rice and curry.   Lastly for dessert l had the special for the day (they only had one dessert). It was fritters accompanied by strawberry jam and miso sauce. The fritters were just the right amount of crunchy and they tasted sort of like funnel cake from a fair.   Overall it was a very pleasant experience eating lunch here, I'm sure the dinner menu is even better, and I hope I can come back again to experience it.",

This is not an inexpensive restaurant ($200 for two) but from the outside the grounds look like a worn out playground and the interior is in need of deep cleaning and serious restoration. Any fine chef knows great dining is more than just the food.  We eat with our eyes and it is a full body experience. The food is worth returning but the environment is not.",

    "text": "Nobuo At Teeter House is one of the places I can go to to experience wonderful exciting magical foods that are unlike any foods I'd ever prepare at home.   The shochu (Japanese Vodka like liquor) flights are interesting and fun to try because they are made in a careful meticulous way and not just poured in your glass. The shochu flights have different aromas and changing flavors and you need to just sip them very slowly threw your dining.  Everything we had was more wonderful than I can describe but everything is also very small plates that are meant to be shared. You might need to order between two though four plates a person depending on what you pick.  Both the dishes on the cold plate menu we tried really were like fireworks in your mouth. They were so layered with many very good flavors. This time we tried the Grapefruit and Hamachi that tasted magical and the Carpaccio that tasted and looked magical. The carpaccio comes out with someone pouring a boiling steaming oil on it and they bring you out the smallest amount of the tastiest focaccia bread to soak up the insanely delicious remaining goodness on the plate. They were so good it will be a hard decision to try something different next time.  One of the more adventurous dishes is the Fried Black Cod orange vinaigrette and BONE CHIPS. This meal has lots of flavor and the bone chips are far more tasty than any potato chip that you ever put in your mouth. My only criticism is that this was an even smaller fish than I had last time with only one piece of bone chips instead of the three pieces I had last time.  Service was gracious and outstanding.  I enjoyed my meal here very much but I don't think Nobuo at Teeter House is for everyone because the plates are very small and most of the plates are mostly protein with a small amount of vegetables. Rice is not served with the meals because it is not traditional in Japan when you drink Japanese spirits since they might be made of rice.  Nobuo at Teeter House participates on local dines dot com and you can save a good amount of money if you take advantage of that.",

    "text": "This place is a sorry excuse for a restaurant.  As someone who has food allergies, it is embarrassing and never easy to try and explain to a waiter why you can or can't eat something.  Most of the time, waiters and chefs are overly accommodating and make an uncomfortable situation into a positive experience.  Nobu was the complete opposite and made me feel like I did something wrong by walking in the door.  My review of this place:  The food: I wouldn't know, they refused to adjust any of their dishes.  Example: I politely asked if they could leave off their ponzu sauce on a sashimi dish, and they couldn't do that.  As a place that prides themselves on fresh sushi, how can you not accommodate this request? They refused to serve me any food at all, and make adjustments to any of their dishes. Apparently everything they make has soy, even all of their sashimi/ sushi dishes( which I believe are made to order). I had to sit and watch my friends eat, while I sat there. I've been to plenty of sushi/ Asian restaurants, and have been accommodated every time.   The waiter: I really wish I remembered his name so I could tell everyone that reads this what an a-hole this guy was.  Not only was he rude to me, he refused to allow us to talk to the chef. He didn't even apologize, but instead seemed annoyed that I had any sort of request to change their food in any way. Apparently he could care less that I could've gotten extremely sick from eating the soy sauce. There was no one in the restaurant and they treated us like crap.   This place is an elitist establishment that does not know how to treat their customers with respect, I would never eat here again and will tell everyone I know to go somewhere else.",

For starters - We had the Grapefruit and Hamachi - which was fantastic.. but maybe 3-4 bites in total and some sort of tempura vegetable.   For the main, we had the Soft Shell Crab Salad, Karei Karaage, Fried Soft Shell Shrimp, and Foie Gras. I think I remember the Karei being the best of those dishes. And my colleagues said the Foie Gras was there least favorite.    It was a great experience and I think one reviewer said it best.. I'd go back during restaurant week but I am not sure how much of a regular I would be.",

    "text": "What a find!  Maybe being from out of town helped me appreciate Nobuo a bit more. First, the restaurant is in a restored bungalow residence. An extremely quaint reception and the space restricts the number of tables and provides focus on the food. The entry is warm, although, I don't think I would want to be seated in the single foyer table. Tonight I was flying solo so I ate at the bar. They go out of their way to explain the dining experience. I had read the menu prior to going but I'm sure they've had people coming in looking for a sushi bar.   I love how the small plate revolution is invading the American dinig experience. After traveling through Spain, I gained an appreciation not just for the breadth of different options it creates, but also for the group experience. Anyone who eats with me knows that if it's on your plate, it's fair game for me to taste. The small plate restaurant just legitimizes that and gives you a ticket to the show too.   While they have an extensive sake list, I opted for an Orion to start. My first plate was the kimchi and dried shrimp. Amazing and I would attack anyone trying to hon in on this little wonder. Order your own!  The cabbage has been wonderfully spiced and aged sufficiently to let the flavors get naughty with each other. Add to that a portion of dried shrimp and red pepper to add a salty and spicy component to show. I followed up with the Tako and Tomato. Another solid dish with house made mozzarella, fresh tomato and a lucious piece of tender grilled octopus. Finally, I completed the event with a Yellow Tail Cerviche. They allow their Cerviche to cure individually and the hamachi was a perfect protien to pickle.   The services was as thoughtful and outstanding as their attention and respect for the food.",

The decor is very modern with hints of Asian, hence Asian fusion. hehe.   We were seated by the window. Thank god because my mom needs fresh air. Anyway we ordered the  Ebi Salad (Shrimp, rice noodle, purple basil, mint , cucumber, nuoc cham $9) - The shrimp is on skewers you get two skewers with three shrimps on each. The shrimp are spicy! But its mild for those of you who love spicy. The dressing reminds me of vietnamese fish sauce. Goes well with the rice noodles and cucumbers.   Tofu Salad- Tofu with egg noodles and romaine lettuce with peanut sauce. The tofu are grilled with soy sauce so the outside is covered with flavor. The noodles are cold and I think I prefer this type of noodle hot.   Pork Belly Buns Braised (pork belly, pickled mustard greens $8) - A plate comes with two. I think this is the thing to get here. If you are Chinese it is kind of like the duck skin buns but this is much better! You get more meat and the flavor is to die for. As garnish or for looks there are pickled celery in the middle. I am not a huge fan of celery but that was really good. Overall our favorite dish!  The bathroom is not labeled but it very spacious and matches the decor of the rest of the restaurant. There seems to be a little living room right by the bathroom with couches and stuff. Seems cozy!   If I ever come back to Phoenix I would like to come and try their dinner menu.",

    "text": "I will just start by saying I love Nobuo at Teeter House! I mean this restaurant is A-MAZING! I was in Phoenix for a conference for a few days, I am SO glad that I checked out this establishment.   It was a Friday night around 9:20pm. I came with two friends after shopping in Scottsdale. There weren't too many people as it was near their closing time. We were seated quickly. I looked around for a bit, the restaurant certainty lives up to its name: it is in a house! I really like this unique setup and the ambience is pretty upscale. Our server seemed very nice and was knowledgeable about the items on the menu. I wanted to order the pork belly with steamed buns but was told the steamer left for the day and it was for lunch only. So I ordered the pork belly wrapped in banana leaves and the Japanese kimchi. My two friends ordered a shrimp and a fish dish.   I have to say that I loved the pork belly. It came in a very nice presentation wrapped in banana leaves. The pork was very tender and juicy. The rice that came with the pork was very tasty too. Oh, let me comment on the Japanese kimchi please. It is out of this world good. Like what our server told us, the Japanese kimchi is fresh so it is very different and a million times better than the Korean version. I let my friends have some of my pork belly. Both of them raved about it. My friend's fried shrimp came with some veggie in the middle. He shared some with us, it was very good I must say. The other friend liked her yellowtail too but the portion seemed a little small to me.  We left the restaurant very satisfied. The food was so good that i was still thinking about it the next day. Man, I wish I had more time in Phoenix so I could go there again. The restaurant is a little on the pricy side but I think it is definitely worth it for the quality of food and atmosphere. BTW they can validate parking but not for valet parking though which we paid $10.   Overall, it is one of the best Japanese restaurants I've visited across the country. Actually scratch the Japanese, it is one of the best restaurants i've visited by far. I'd come here everyday if I could. It is THAT good!!!",

    "text": "Food: delicious small portions with fresh creative favors. Pricey yes but I'm okay with that if quality is good. Grapefruit hamachi was tasty, soft shell crab salad, oysters, cauliflower was the vegetable of the day. Orange fritter desert.   Ambiance: cozy and historic home. Live music on patio was simply adorable with a separate menu very affordable for casual meal.   So why the 3 star review?  Service.   Waitstaff was knowledgable and brought out all of food in timely manner etc no issues there. But I felt overall that the atmosphere was snobby and unaccommodating. I felt like I was judged immediately as someone who was going to ask for a Rock n Roll and a sake bomb and that I was treated as such. (I understand that this is clearly not the place). Just because I removed my septum piercing 10 years ago and don't have a sleeve, this apparently makes me not sophisticated hipster enough for this establishment.   First young lady who came by our table took drink orders. I asked for a matcha green tea and pointed at the menu to confirm that was what I had requested (I didn't want to get stuck with a green tea leaf beverage which is brewed leaves as opposed to whisked matcha powder). Her response was very snobby \"matcha is green tea\" (as if I didn't know this) and then \"those other teas are brown\" (referring to green tea leaves)... Okay... Not a good first impression. But I can move on.   A member of our party asked for hot sake and they informed us they only serve it cold. I get that but taste is a personal preference and clearly they have the capability to warm up a liquid. We asked them if they could do this for us. No. Then implying that we could do this ourselves, we then asked if we could have hot tea and cold sake. The waitress threatened \"if I see you heating up the sake, I am going to have to ask you to leave because you are asking to do something that I clearly already told you not to do\"  I am usually very forgiving of poor service or bad attitudes. Everyone has a bad day from time to time. In their defense our table was a larger party of a somewhat boisterous nature. Still I can't excuse the pretentious attitude.   I'd probably come back for the food but will keep a low profile with a smaller group.",

    "text": "Simply put, I really enjoyed my experience at Nobuo. During restaurant week I had an opportunity to grab a dinner by myself at a restaurant that was on my list in Phoenix. I was not disappointed. My meal included the seasonal vegetable antipasto with a small cold soup, shishito peppers and I can't remember what else. Everything was tasty and elegant. Then came the sashimi: I opted for the Yellowtail and Grapefruit. It was fantastic. The flavors were delicate and balanced, each bite on an individual soup spoon.  Next I slipped in an order of my own; the uni. Again, fantastic.  The \"big\" course was a lobster roll. For those not in the know, this means sandwich, not sushi. It was fantastic, as were the japanese french fries (tossed in nori).  Dessert was an orange almond fritter with jasmine tea ice cream. Excellent.  I use a shortage of words because the food was that good. My wordy reviews are for mediocre and bad food.  The tab with tip and a beer for one person: $85 I will go back.",

Each dish was a work of art, a pleasure to both the eyes and the lips. We had a white fish carpaccio that exploded with unique and complementary flavors. It deserves to be singled out for special recognition, but everything was special. Really.",

    "text": "This review will be slightly skewed, as I only had dessert here. We might have had more had we been greeted at the door and offered a menu or a smile. My husband and I walked in to check drink prices and considered bringing our group over to their very charming patio. This restaurant is very clean, appealing and has a lovely atmosphere and decor.  So we waited for a bit for someone to talk to us and when no one did, we grabbed a menu ourselves and checked out the selection. Quite a nice wine list and variety. Somewhat pricey for a birthday drink-fest, though so we headed back next-door. As we were walking out, a server said \"oh you're leaving?\". Well, yes we are and no one even noticed we were here.  Part two: after being denied dessert next door I came here to request any type of dessert to go and would pay whatever it cost. If it was up to Greg at the front, this would be a 5 star review. He sounded confused and unsure, but did check and was friendly. He said the chef didn't like to make it to go, as the presentation would be off. I understand this and know they take such pride in product, so I explained this would be okay, I would certainly take into account this isn't a typical presentation and appreciated them doing it. I then ask if they have a candle. I'm told no. I ask what those small flickering tea lights are and am told \"a candle\". Yes, unconventional, but what can one do in a pinch? So Greg gets one for me. Thanks Greg. So now I'm pretty happy and waiting and a server, possibly even manger by her demeanor walks into the kitchen and loudly says a disgusted \"REALLY?!\". I hear them talking about what apparently is my awful request for a to go dessert with a tea light for the birthday boy. After ranting and rolling her eyes she walked out and pretend smiles at me. Puh-lease.  Greg hands me the dessert (no fork, but that's okay) and I gladly pay my 7 bucks while also tipping him 7 for being hospitable. The dessert was vegan and incredibly tasty. It actually had French fries that tasted like gummy worms!  Sorry Nobuo. If I hadn't gotten mocked we would have for sure been back for a romantic dinner and some drinks soon.",

    "text": "Surprised it has taken me this long to make it to Nobuo at Teeter. On the day I finally decided to come I arrive just before 5 and they don't open until 5:30 for the start of their Happy Hour. So no big deal, I went to Rose and Crown for a beer and to watch the looooong line form at Bianco...  After one leisurely beer, it was 5:30 and I made my way into the Teeter house.  They had 4-5 happy hour food specials and 2 specialty happy hour drinks that night. Along with their extensive sake and wine menu they offered some specialty cocktails and Japanese beers. Deciding to sit at the counter, I was able to watch Nobuo work his magic preparing the sashimi dishes on the menu. They had a cocktail offering at happy hour they called the smokey bomb...with grapefruit, shishito peppers and some smokey component...honestly I don't remember all the details but this was more of a savory cocktail than a sweet one. I found it to be quite piquant but not overwhelming. [It complemented everything I ordered quite well.]  I started with the Nasu Bacon Miso, japanese eggplant with a dollup of bacon miso and bonito shavings....not stellar but a good start....  Next I ordered the short rib steam buns...this was quite tasty. Sliced grilled marinated short rib served on a steamed bun. I look forward to trying the pork belly buns next time.  To finish my outting here I decided on the Tempura Squash blossoms stuffed with bacon and goat cheese served with a side of curry sea salt. Let me just say that 3 days later I am still thinking about just this dish, craving the flavors and wondering how to make or where I can get the curry sea salt.   Nobuo prides himself in staying as local as possible for many of his menu items and keeping it all seasonal. The menu changes regularly as a result.   All I can say is who would wait for HOURS to get the food across the way when you can have a wonderful savory treats here.",

The good stars were out,  the couple that was supposed to have those two seats, cancelled last minute.  Chef Fukada was very charming.  The couple he was preparing the food for, were very gracious.  The chef explained what he was making for this couple.  The dishes were like a work of art.  It was an experience.  We ordered the grapefruit hamachi, my husband would say I inhaled it.  It was so delicious, the texture and flavor combination was amazing.  The curry lamb was very good too, even though I usually don't eat lamb, I ended up eating half of this dish, so we had to order another item.  Last we had the soft shell panini, I loved this ones.  Anything with bread makes my day! Yes this place is a little pricey, but you should consider it for a special occasion.  I think it is worth it.",

Small place, it's at the Teeter House, it has a few rooms for dinning each with 3 or 4 tables and it also has some patio seating. Very homey with an Japanese twist.   The food is the star here. I ordered the Duck salad (12) and Pork belly (8) buns. The buns were great, have never had anything like this in phoenix. The potbelly is fat and delicious with a slight smoky flavor, it had a slightly sweet demi?, and some pickled cucumber. You get the savory and richness from the pork belly and demi and the crunchy, freshness from the cucumber. The bun was soft and fluffy, a little chewy, but complimented the pork belly well. The Duck salad stole the show. It's a warm salad with zin soy duck, grilled organic greens and oranges, mixed with a yuzu vin. The salad comes out slight warm, it has a smoky. citrus flavor and the greens and duck do not get overpowered by being drench in vin.  Absolutely some of the best Japanese food I've had, defiantly going back for dinner.",

We ordered the grapefruit hamachi, the house cured salmon, the tuna tataki and the yellowtail ceviche for our cold dishes. The grapefruit hamachi was our favorite. The house cured salmon surprised me as I would not have thought of pairing salmon and pecorino romano cheese. For our hot dishes we ordered the warm duck salad, the seabass & mushroom, the coconut curry lamb, and the black cod.  The presentation of each of the dishes (hot or cold) was beautiful though some were a little small (4 bites). This place is not cheap but if you have a special occasion or want to splurge then this is good place to do that. I left the restaurant reliving the wonderful flavors we had eaten.",

The portion is also a perfect size, don't be fooled because it isn't a gigantic portion. It is however the exact right size to really fill you up.  My fiance was very impressed by their selection of Japanese beers, including one from the Gunma prefecture where he lived.   All of this in such an intimate and classy setting with a very attentive and friendly waitress. I wouldn't worry about dressing up too much but you would feel weird to go in sweats or gym clothes.

This is place good, but not GREAT. I think it is overpriced for the quality and quantity. 4 stars! Food was yummy, but I wasn't wow'ed.  I would recommend getting the oyster with uni and the saikyo yaki. Grapefruit hamachi was okay, but everyone seems to order it.   Happy dining!",

    "text": "This would have been a 5 star review but we were served chicken raw in the center which was not stated on the menu that it would come at that temperature. So we politely asked the server if we could get a new one that is cooked through not knowing that they intentionally undercook it, well apparently we must be uncultured swine for wanting cooked through chicken because the person expediting that night came out full guns blazing a to let us know that is how the chicken comes and he will bring us new ones but it will still be cooked the same. I am pretty sure in the state of AZ it is a health code violation to not cook chicken to 165, my husband would have his kitchen shut down or be marked down if an inspector knew he was cooking chicken under temperature. The thing though that bothers me most is there is no disclaimer or statement in the description of the dish that says it comes purposefully undercooked so I could have politely declined that dish. I get the chickens might have been free range and organic and safely sourced but it doesn't say that anywhere on the menu so how am I supposed to know if the chicken is safe to eat that way or not. Also it seems like this is a common complaint because I found 4 other reviews saying the same exact thing about the undercooked chicken. So you guys do you with the undercooked chicken but please state in the menu that is how it is served because people like pregnant women are highly susceptible to food borne illness and should be given the notice that is how their chicken will becoming to them. Below are two photos I found from other reviews that look exactly how the chicken was served to us.",

    "text": "\"What?! You haven't been to Nobuo yet? [And you call yourself a foodie]...\" This is the typical reaction I get from others concerning this restaurant. Enough is enough, right? I finally gave in and met a friend for dinner on a Thursday evening about a week ago.  Let's just delve right in, shall we? Modern Asian inspired din was served tapas style. Wait staff was courteous, observant, patient, and well... Just awesome.  Only three mackerel specials were served that evening. We had one of them. The mackerel had two phases. The first was sliced sashimi phase with fresh slices sitting next to the rest of the body in an artful design. After we finished the sashimi, they took the rest of the body away and deep fried it so we could eat it like soft shelled crab for the second phase. To most, this may sound not appealing, but if you're an adventurous eater like we are, you would've loved this.  We had two octopus plates. One was the \"famous-featured-in-Phoenix-mag-\" Tako and Tomato. The other was a battered fried tako. Prepared in different ways, it was surprising that both were so tender and delicate and almost melted in your mouth. I find that octopus can be chewy if improperly prepared but these were done to perfection. Bravo!  Hamachi and grapefruit - a menu staple that should be ordered every time!  Clams with mushrooms - flavor bomb! Every last bite devoured... Including the broth. Licked dry.   Smokey Thompson - I was drawn to this cocktail for the smokey part and whiskey part with some yuzu juice and egg whites and honey. It's refreshing and unique tasting and one of my favorite combinations now.   Blossom and Smoke- this drink just sounded cool. It's potent and unique tasting. I enjoyed this but love the Smokey Thompson more.   Overall, my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our girls' night catching up. We splurged and spent just around $160 or so for both of us - a couple cocktails each and all the small entrees we ordered. Alas, this taste adventure does not come thriftily but we knew that and sometimes it's fun to go nuts with food every once in awhile.",

    "text": "Nobuo is a food experience!   The restaurant is very simple. Minimal art/decorations, small seating arrangements and a very low occupancy. There were two menu types when we went: the \"Individual\" menu or the \"Shareable\" menu. But with both menus offered, there were still not a ton of options to pick from.   The food is very simplistic. Few ingredients are used, but the flavors are  strong and natural. The plates are small, some being just a few bites. And each course is timed to come out separately.   We tried a variety of items (Grapefruit & Hamachi, Yellow Tail Ceviche, Pork Belly wrapped in Banana Leaf, Chicken Nanban, Clam & Mushrooms, etc.) The best item on the menu, hands down, is the Grapefruit & Hamachi!!! If you only order one thing (because it is a slightly pricey menu) - make sure you order the Hamachi!    After our dinner I was sad to say that Nobuo was a little over-rated. But it was exciting to see Chef Nobuo walking through the restaurant talking to the guests. I'll admit, I fangirled, but just a little bit.   ;)",

    "text": "Yum!  My friend and I were in AZ for a long weekend and we were spending our last evening in Phoenix before flying out early the next morning. We'd had our fill of Mexican food so we were perusing Yelp for some help. Unfortunately, many places are closed on Sundays so we were pretty limited on where to eat, especially because we didn't want to have to drive v. far.  We ended up at Nobuo at Yelp's suggestion, after deciding that we wanted sushi. Unfortunately, this wasn't quite the sushi bar we were expecting. Fortunately, neither of us was that hungry so the small portions didn't bother us much.  We chose five dishes to share between the two of us and it was mildly satisfying. I don't recommend going here if you're feeling ravenous unless you're willing to spend a small fortune. Each dish is only about 4 bites and ranges from $18 to $30.  We had the yellowtail ceviche, tuna tataki with beet puree, shiromi carpaccio, tako and tomato, and the pork belly. The fish was incredibly fresh and the preparation was v. balanced with the appropriate amount of acidity, salt, and umami flavors. The shiromi carpaccio was drizzled with a hot chili oil at the table, which partially cooked the fish; we loved the chili oil so much, we wished we could ask for some to douse the other dishes with. The tako was tender and the tomato used in the dish was perfectly ripe. The pork belly was nice and tender and served on a bed of deliciously seasoned rice.  It was a surprisingly yummy meal with incredible presentation and lovely ambiance. I'd say this is definitely more of a special occasion place.",

The Hamachi sashimi prepared with avocado, grapefruit and served in spoonfuls to be savored in a single mouthful was definitely fantastic. The okonomiyaki good but normal. Overall a very solid 4 stars possibly worthy of a fifth one.   I then came back for dinner and had a 80 dollars tasting menu, with different courses, all delicious. It was a real pleasure and I would highly recommend it. 5 stars deserved. Quite pricy but absolutely justified by quality.",

My friend's  crab sandwich was served with a tiny portion of slaw, about one tablespoon of cabbage. It looked like a joke.

It sits in PHX's historic Heritage Square, and it is a classy and delicious addition to its restaurant neighbors.  I went in for lunch & sat right at the bar built for 4, and it wasn't very crowded so I got a great look at how Nobuo fixed up the space.  The interior of the house still has that classic vintage old PHX house look, but the interior is modern & warm.  You cannot help but relax inside.  I am beer fanatic, and I was pleased to see that Nobuo had some unbelievable beers available, including an Oyster Stout.  I have to say I am looking forward to going back to have beers with my food.  In fact, when I was there, there were two wine salesmen (very \"wine snobby\" in their pitch and wine vernacular) eating nearby, and even they were in awe of the beers & how they tasted.  The menu is built in smaller portions, and I would suggest going with 2-3 other people.  Order like 5-7 things and enjoy every single one.  Since I was rolling solo, I ordered two things and left happy but very stuffed.  I can say that the dishes I had were well balanced in either sweet & spice, or savory & light.  The lamb I had was the best I've ever eaten.  Stop reading this and just go.  You won't be disappointed.  It is the perfect trifecta of atmosphere, delicious food and tasty drinks.",

Food variety, quality, and presentation were amazing.   I am always a little concerned whether I will leave satisfied with a tapas meal comprised of small plates, but not a problem here. We left pleasantly full. I am pretty sure the restaurant arranged my selections to come out in the best order to ensure a proper, rounded meal with the heartier options coming out last and really hitting the spot!  We had a hard time narrowing down to the recommended 2-3 plates per person, with all the great options available. We were happy with the amount of food and quality of our 7 plates but could easily come back and pick out 4-5 more that sounded great for next time. We ended up spending about $150 for 2, including the most expensive beers on the menu and all 3 specials of the day. Totally worth it!   I can vouch for these as great choices: - grapefruit & Hamachi  - duck salad  - oxtail (was a special not on menu) - yellowtail ceviche - kimchee   For dessert we had green tea ice cream served on chocolate mousse - very interesting and refreshing.   If you make this your splurge on a vacation or special occasion, you will not regret it!",

    "text": "\"Waitress has severe asthma attack\"  Nobuo has the ambiance of an urban chic Japanese tea house which contradicts the Victorian Teeter House exterior.  Nonetheless, it looked like a fun place to grab lunch so in we went.  We had very high expectations because of all the reviews.   We stopped by for a quick lunch downtown and were greeted by an obviously overwhelmed waitress who directed us to the bar since no other tables were available. The place really didn't appear very busy, but she was the only server.  She gave us a drink menu and when she came by the next time she informed my wife that all the iced teas were unavailable.  She loves tea, so this wss a big disappointmet.  Instead my wife asked for another drink, after which the server promptly walked off without taking my drink order too.  When she stopped by later we placed our order and she stuck around long enough to hear what I wanted to drink. The menu looked pretty tasty and creative, but sadly they were out of the watermelon sunomono, which I really wanted to try.   After 10 minutes of waiting for drinks and food we heard crying from the back.  We never saw our waitress again. The kitchen staff started serving tables, but they clearly lacked experience on the computer/register.   It was at this point that we decided to leave. We didn't get any food or drinks and there was no one around to validate our parking either.  Update: The \"nervous breakdown\" was apparently a severe asthma attack.",

The table that got sat after us was older, and they got better explanations of everything when they got sat.  We had to ask.  The clams were really good, the black cod was just okay, only had like 4 tiny pieces, but the sauce was yummy.  Their kimchi tasted like a white person version...not supposed to be offensive.  4 tables in the room we were in.  Acoustics were awful, sound bounced everywhere and was kinda loud and echoey.  Plus I like oldies music but didn't go with the place.  Also didn't care for our server.  She seemed like she was trying really hard at being one of those trendy hipster type people but just came across like a snob with a working man's complex",

I tried probably 7 or 8 dishes and left the place pretty satisfied (food, quality and price wise).  The bass was probably my favorite.  The two highlights of the night were the tea and desert.  The tea had a toasted flavor which was unique and delicious and the desert (we had chocolate mousse and bread pudding) and both of them were outstanding.   The intimate ambiance and setting is pretty nice for a conversation (friends, romance, business) although the service was just OK (in this kind of places I always expect an exceptional service).  Highly recommended.",

I have only had the opportunity to watch such fine sushi chefs on 'No Reservations' and the like, but I would imagine that Nobuo would compare in likes of a different sushi experience.  I was impressed with the food, presentation, taste, and the unique change from the common sashimi and other Japanese fare from other restaurants.  The fifth star is not present, unfortunately, due to service.  My wife and I went during restaurant week so the menu was limited, but very delicious to say the least.  I will have to go back to write a complete review on the food items.   To start the meal we were given a plate with four items, what I really enjoyed was the Kim Chi from that plate.  Our starters were yellow tail shooters and a plate of white fish (sorry I don't remember the name) topped with a hot oil, WOW to both starters.  For our entree my wife had the pork belly, tasty, but what blew us away was my entree of bass steamed in parchment paper.  These were all accompanied with draft Sapporo and refreshing Sake.  I am not the biggest dessert fan, but my wife did enjoy.  Thank you Nobuo we will be back, worth every penny!",

First Course:  Hassun (4 piece sampler anitpasto and sashimi plate) It was amazing Edamame chilled soup and Japanese Kimchi with dried shrimp were the highlights.  Sashimi Course: Yellowtail and Grapefruit- Served on a spoon to get it all in one bite.  The flavors were just amazing and paired very well together.    Entree Course: Sea Bass & Japanese Mushrooms Baked in Parchment- This was absolutely AMAZING.  I will go back just for this dish.  I don't even like mushrooms and I don't think there was even one left when I finished this course.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly to chopstick tender perfection.   Then a little rice cake to soak up the sake juices with just really made this the perfect dish.    Dessert Course: Arai Pastry Japanese Desserts- Three desserts from Arai Bakery in Tempe that were a perfect way to finish the meal.  One cream puff with strawberry, a creme de caramel, and a orange mousse served on an orange peel.    I can't wait for my chance to head back to Nobuo to try more of the James Beard award winners cuisine.  It is for sure top notch.",

It's a leather couch off of the kitchen in a seperate room next to the bathroom.  Has a fairly large wooden low table to match.  We were good with this!!  How many times do you get to totally chill and chow at the same time eating out!!  The staff and the kitchen really took care of us!  Really enjoyed the black sole with bone chips, kumamotos with uni, hamachi, foie, kimchi, squash blossoms, housemade cocktail with lemongrass and ginger, tetaki with beets and my favorite beer, Kohishikari (sp?)

If you have ever had Asian style pork buns before, they use that same bun dough and make a little pancake out of it and put a piece of luscious pork belly in it with just a touch of a tangy Asian style sauce and a thinly sliced, homemade pickle. Soo good. I want these again. For every meal. =P  I also had the panko crusted soft shell crab sandwich. It was good. They obviously bake their own bread, which is nice. Maybe ask for a little extra sauce next time I order it, but yes, yummy.  I am looking forward to going for dinner. The dinner menu looks awesome as well.",

The food was delicious and Chef Nobuo did a phenomenal job putting together the menu. Some of our favorites were the oysters, the shashimi, the hamachi, yellowtail, lamb, and foie gras. Since we had a large group of 8 we were the ones making most of the noise and I did feel bad for the few tables that were around us since I'm sure they had a hard time conversing. I would gladly go back and try the tasting menu.",

I have to admit, I am an \"aspring gourmet\" in the sense that occasionally I find a menu difficult because I'm not familiar with the unusual dishes and don't know if I will like them, while at the same time sensing that they are amazingly delicious and I should just \"get over it\" and take the plunge. That proved to be the case at Nubuo.  My other half and I made the right choice in sitting at the 4 seater bar. Not only did we get to hang out and chat with the personable Nobu himself while watching him at his artful craft, but we also enjoyed the expertise of a friendly regular who steered us to all the \"must have\" menu items....which at the end of the day, is pretty much everything,  Our culinary inhibitions were quickly put to rest by a tasty house martini of vodka, watermelon, basil and mint. The grapefruit and hamachi dish was the stand out, served as a \"shot\" in ceramic spoons. Nobu also knows his way around wine, and we were impressed with a Turley red that went down very well with his Kumamoto Oysters with Uni. Watching Nobu prepare his dishes also helped us decide on what we'll be having on our next visit: the hirame carpaccio looked especially good.  The staff are a delight and the experience was altogether sublime.  The dishes are served tapas style in small portions (by US standards) because his focus is clearly on quality over quantity, so if you lean towards \"more is more\" you may find reason to grumble. However, if you appreciate top notch food, complete with \"oohs\", \"ahs\" and \"OMGs\", put this place at the top of your to try list, we will definitely be back!  Dom Arrigato!",

We started with a special that was calamari fritters and the Calamari should have been chopped because they were incredibly tough.  We then had another small plate with eggplant, bacon and can't remember what else...OK... but not something we would rave about.  Then we moved on to the warm duck salad.  It was bland, with the exception of the duck.  The duck breast did have a nice flavor, but that didn't compensate for the lack of flavor of the grilled lettuce leaves.  It had interesting ingredients, but didn't feel they melded together.  The white fish with the variety of mushrooms was the best thing we had.  The mushrooms were outstanding.  We did have the clams with bok choy or cabbage and bacon.  I thought it was good, but my husband ate just one clam and it was not as fresh as we anticipated, so I had the remaining  clams and thought they were o.k.  All in all, we have eaten at other Japanese restaurants,  and for us, this was not a stand out and the likelihood  that we would return for  a second chance seem improbable.  Sorry!   By the way, the servers were very good at explaining everything and brought our dishes out timely, not rushing us, but not taking forever, either.   Service I would give a 5 star, but we would have expected 5 star in the food category!",

We ordered the pork belly buns (overly fatty), curry lamb chops (burnt), Okonomiyaki (bland), parchment wrapped fish (unoriginal).

Nobu's ability to find the perfect complementary combinations of flavors for each dish is obviously very well thought out and tested.  I have dined at Urasawa and Nobu in LA, and I would put Teeter House with this list.  Of course Urasawa has its intimacy, star power, as well as the much higher price for delicacies, so I'm not saying they are the same.  However, I certainly love having a much less expensive alternative that delivers on quality and a phenomenal experience.  Phoenix is lucky to have Nobuo at Teeter House.  Thank goodness the entertainment stars are for the most part in LA or this place would become too exclusive.",

The menu at Nobuo is smaller, but we were impressed by the server and chef taking time to explain the foods and flavors, and you could tell they took pride in getting things just right.    Exotic and delicious food, with service to match.",

Also, the food was quite unimpressive. The pork buns that I was so excited about just tasted like pork with plum sauce on a steamed bun --- just tasted terribly sweet and salty and not in a good way. Plus, I probably could have gone to an Asian grocery store, bought 3 items, and made each bun for under a buck each! On that note, our bill (2 people) came out to almost $100 and there wasn't a single dish that we ordered that was even remotely remarkable. So disappointing.",

    "text": "Out of town family wanted an interesting lunch....downtown, no less!  Nobuo has been on my wanna do list for awhile.  We arrived on a quiet Tuesday and had the undivided attention of our waiter.  He recommended a starter.  I can only describe it.  The presentation was 4 spoons with artfully arranged food on them.  The waiter said, \"Eat it in one bite.\" The experience was quite unusual.  Various delicious flavors developed in my mouth as I realized my bite had liquified. Then on to my softshell crab sandwich.  It also was close to perfect. The sauce made it rise above.  I wouldn't call it spicy, or smoky ...just incredible.  I didn't believe I had room for dessert, but 1 dessert and 3 spoons was doable.  The choice was pumpkin flan with 5 spice ice cream.  I tasted the flan.  It was good.  But then I tasted the flan with the ice cream on top.  Again, all the flavors orchestrated a food experience in my mouth.  The sum was better than the parts!  Our lunch was so much more than we could have expected.  What a great experience.  Now Nobuo at Teeter House is on my must return list!",

I am a bit of a perfectionist and Nobuo exceeded all of my expectations. I was looking for a quaint and intimate setting to have this baby shower and boy did I find it.    It was a beautiful day, so we were able to enjoy the private patio area as well as the inside of the restaurant. This was perfect for the 26 guests that attended. We enjoyed 'passed apps' to start. The Teeter Tots are AMAZING and my new favorite thing! All of my guest who didn't think they liked tofu were in love with these tots. We also had 'watermelon and goat cheese' and an eggplant app (both very tasty) followed by a buffet style lunch. This was not your ordinary buffet! The food Nobuo prepared was so delicious and all the guests enjoyed. We had Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, a pork Cutlet Sandwich, and Ebi salad. At first I was worried that some of my family who were not accustomed to this type of food would be turned off by it. Much to my surprise everyone couldn't say enough good things about the food. Even if you aren't having a private party you must go just to try the food.   All of the staff were helpful and professional. Sarah made everything easy and wonderful. From start to finish no detailed was missed. We started to plan this event a few months in advanced and she is very easy to work with. She will collaborate with you and make sure that what you envision for your party becomes a reality. I feel that she went over and above as did all the staff. They took care of my guests and were attentive to their needs. I have thrown a good amount of parties and this by far was not only my favorite but the easiest one I have done. I was actually able to enjoy the day with my guests thanks to the amazing staff.   I looked at many venues when planning this party and I am so glad I made the choice to have it here. Not only was the venue, staff and food perfect but the price was right too! If you are thinking about having a private party you must check Nobuo at Teeter house out. They really go over and above to accommodate you, your guests and your budget!! You will not be disappointed!!",

First there was a slight hint of sewer in the air which threw me off. I am not sure if it's because the area or the seaweed cooking but it was off putting. We had the something with two fried crab puff like pieces and two other hard deep fried pieces that I think they were calling kimchi which my girlfriend liked but was it worth the cost over some two dollar for four crab puffs at a dive I don't think so. We also have the eggplant with bacon paste(pic 18) which was terrible, nothing like a hard raw eggplant with some bacon jelly on it mmmm mmm.  The Coedo beer was great and the dinner came. The fish my girlfriend ordered was super salty and she didn't like it at all. I had the pork belly which I thought was decent but nothing 100 of places do with the same quality of taste. The desert was the some doughnut holes with some green tea ice cream which was ok but again nothing special. Right down the street you can spend 40$ at Rice Paper and be completely satisfied for a lot less than 120$.",

The omakase dinner was not available the night I went, so we ordered off the menu.  The hamachi with grapefruit was awesome as were the soft shell shrimp & green papaya slaw (great for snacking with a glass of cold beer).  But the star of the night was definitely the pork belly buns.  Finally, a creative way to eat pork belly!  The soft, white buns complemented the fat from the pork belly very well.  Parking was actually note that bad since the restaurant offers validation for the parking structure next door.  Pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food.  This is an all-around winner.  I can't wait to go back.",

It was very fresh as if it was recently caught from the sea! The Grapefruit and Hamachi was also one of my favorites. One spoonful and I could sense all 5 different receptors of my tongue being stimulated. This was very well thought out, so refreshing, and downright impressive. The Pork Belly Buns and Yellow tail were also tasty selections.   A place like this is unique to Arizona, and is a visitor MUST. This restaurant is in a house, with only two rooms that seats 16 seats each. It is a bit more on the fancy side, and get ready to break the bank (during dinner at least). Overall, I left impressed would love to come back for lunch. The place lived up to the hype and I can say the chef rightfully earned the prestigious James Beard award.",

My favorites were: Seabass & Mushrooms - baked in parchment, garlic-butter, sake, soy Soft shell crab sandwiches Yellowtail Ceviche - miyoga , sesame seed, shredded taro  Everything we had was delicious (though I sat out on the Pork Buns, too full at that point though I heard they were delicious).  I had 2 very nice glasses of a pinot to accompany the meal.  All in all, a very nice experience. Quaint, quiet ambience, though we were the only two customers there for an 8:30pm dinner reservation.

However, dinner was way more expensive. We only ordered three small dishes and that was already 60 dollars... Sashimi was just so so. The other two dishes are better but still a little bit pricey for what they are .

Felt like I was showcasing dishes from Iron Chef or some other food challenge show. Like a food orgasm of flavor and textures in My mouth!!! The Con's; small portions & extremely pricey!We easily spent $70 per person. Parking was confusing! No street parking, parking garage around the block.

    "text": "Came here for Restaurant Week with my parents.  We were going to Symphony Hall afterwards and this place was nearby.  Its directly across the way from Pizzeria Bianco and next door to Rose & Crown in the Heritage Square area.  When you walk up, you immediately feel you're walking into the early 1900s as this building has maintained its character throughout the years.  You wouldn't think it'd make sense to put a Japanese restaurant here, but then again this is no ordinary Japanese restaurant.  I'd heard Nobuo Fakoda had a James Beard award to his credit so that (and the solid Yelp reviews) got us the door.  To start the evening I had the pork bun.  Its basically pork belly wrapped in a rice bun with herbs and a pickle.  Small, simple, but bursting with flavor.  Great way to start things off.  For the main course they had bento boxes (basically an assortment of greatest hits in a box).  I chose the seafood bento box which included tuna, salmon, and various other fishes I couldn't recognize.  Included was sticky rice, wasabi, soy sauce, and greens.  Pretty good stuff, though the pieces of fish were perhaps a little big to hold with chop sticks.  For dessert, I got the Arai pastries which included a piece of chocolate cake and what tasted almost like coffee cake.  Both were surprisingly light and airy, and were pretty good, though nothing special in my opinion.  I didn't get any drinks so my bill for the restaurant week meal (including tip) was $50.  I was satisfied and somewhat full, but not uncomfortably so at all.  Overall, a pretty cool restaurant in a really unique location.  Not all of the dishes wowed me, but they did a pretty decent job showcasing their greatest hits during Restaurant Week.  This is definitely a splurge restaurant on a normal night and some of the items, while expensive, won't necessarily fill you up.  The service we got was okay.  The host was a little standoffish and the waitress wasn't completely informed on some of the non-Restaurant Week items so that might be an area for them to address.  Bottomline, if you've got the money and a craving for a Japanese restaurant that goes outside the box, this place will do the job.",

    "text": "So let me start off by saying that when I looked at this place, I looked at it through they eyes of a chef from the SF Bay... I wondered if a 28 Zagat rating in Phoenix is the same as in SF... I can't speak for other places, but in the case of Nobuo at Teeter House, it absolutely does! I would put that food up against anything I've eaten out here, or could make myself  I was there with my girlfriend for her birthday... we arrived a few minutes early for our reservation which wasn't a problem for them (which is always nice) Our waiter was super friendly and conscious but not overbearing... he was great  We got a couple of cocktails (both were really good) with our starters... let me back up... we got starters, small bites and hot dishes...   We got kimchi, the watermelon salad and nasu... I love kimchi, i could eat it with every meal... but theirs was great... the watermelon salad was exceptional... the nasu was something special... after the first round of starters we ordered a bottle of wine and got down to our our meal...   we started with the grapefruit hamachi and the shiromi carpaccio... i am not a fan of truffle oil... usually people overdo it because \"oh my god, it's truffle oil... it's so good!!!\" they used enough on the hamachi that it would be there, but not there... just enough to accent the dish. I do however love yuzu and they used it brilliantly on the carpaccio...   next we ordered entrees... the warm duck salad and karei karaage. The warm duck salad was simple, but lovely... grilled escarole is really nice when it's charred, but not cooked to much... not everyone likes the bitterness of the leaf, but it was a nice accompaniment to the duck and the sauce... the karei karaage was something else... first, it looked really cool... they fried the bones and made a basket to hold the pieces of fish... nice touch... also you can eat the bones, which were great, and the sauce was cool and refreshing.   after this we were still hungry... we overheard \"oysters and uni\" so we asked our waiter about the oysters and got those, along with tako and tomato. The oysters were along the same lines as all the other food... the octopus however, was a complete departure from the rest of the menu... which was not a bad thing at all  octopus, tomato and mozzarella belongs somewhere from Spain to Greece (just change the kind of cheese)... having it at an Japanese influenced restaurant was a pleasant surprise, and shows the outlook of the chef... that it doesn't matter where the food comes from, if it works, use it! Yay!  I can not say enough good things about Nobuo at Teeter House. I hope I am lucky enough to someday own a restaurant like this.  Thank you! Thank you!",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying I was skeptical.  I had no idea what to expect and after reading a ton of reviews, we thought we would give it a shot.   Located in an old converted home in Heritage Park right across from Pizzeria Bianco the place is small and intimate and just an experience in and of itself.  Now for the food.  Where do I begin?  Tapas (small plates) style, and community (share) the experience is in ordering from each section of the menu.  We started with the Kimci and Nasu.  The Kimci is a Napa cabbage cold plate that will rock your world; a little sweet, a little spicy it was a great way to start.    The Nasu is an eggplant with a bacon marinade of sorts on top and while I am describing it poorly it was truly delishous.  Amazing!!  Next was the Yellowtail Ceviche.  This WAS OUT OF THIS F'ING WORLD.  Inexplicable but so, SO GOOD.    Next was 2 off the menu plates, chicken and Wagyu beef short ribs.  The ONLY REASON this place does not get 5 stars is 2 of the 3 different types of chicken were mediocre.  The wasabi grilled chicken was pure wasabi on grilled chicken.    The 2nd was a panko fried chicken, which was moist and delishous but nothing amazing, HOWEVER the 3rd chicken was an orange peel fried chicken that way just so good beyond words.  Lastly, the Wagyu beef short ribs were so so so amazing, I mean, I never wanted the taste to leave my mouth.  The service, very good Juan (our server) was very attentive and very helpful as it was our first time there...but it most definitely will not be our last...oh and THEY VALIDATE FOR PARKING ;)",

The restaurant feels like it wants you to just enjoy the meal.   The service was fantastic. Everyone was attentive and knew the menu.   Most importantly, the food is exquisite and worth every penny. Yes, it can be expensive and the portions small, but every dish highlights the flavors and textures of all its ingredients, which are fresh and sometimes local.   If you're worried about cost, go with a friend and split it down the middle. You'll have more bang for your buck and still walk out satiated.   Hands down the best Japanese in Phoenix.",

I went there December 5, 2010 and we had:  Japanese Chips - A very yummy snack made with fingerling potatoes.  Ebi Salad - Very refreshing! I could eat this for lunch everyday.  Duck Breast Salad - I have never been a huge duck fan, but oh my god, this duck tasted like steak. Its amazing!!  Okonomiyaki - Very good and filling. The japanese mayo is great too!  Shiromi Carpaccio - This dish was excellent! Make sure to get extra bread, because the oil and seasonings are so amazing. You will want to savor every bite!  and for my drink, you must try the Devils Haircut! I could have drank quite a few of these! I cant wait to go back on my next Arizona trip!",

Just keep in mind that you should book a table in advance because it gets booked quickly and it's usually full! We tried several dishes including the pork belly served over rice and banana leaf which was my most favorite item! It was very tender and melted in mouth.i would highly suggest that! We tried the chicken which was undercook unfortunately but the chef took it back to the kitchen and served us a new plate. That was a little disappointing because my expectation of fine dining restaurants is higher especially a place like here that don't have that offers kind of personalized dining experience. Overall it was a good experience in Phoenix area and I would suggest you to give a try at least for once!",

My once favorite Japanese restaurant (now closed) called Shinbay has some sort of relation to the chef at Nobuo. I'm not sure the exact relationship, but the quality and innovation is comparable (ambiance is totally different). My husband and I went for lunch one day. We went there for a late lunch and we were two of the six people at the restaurant. We sat at the bar and watched chef Nobuo unpack pots and pans for the dinner. It was slightly awkward, but we need to consider that we chose those seats at the end of lunch (right before dinner).   The food. Oh my gosh, the food. You could lock me in a metal box with this food and I would still give it five stars. The presentation, the combination of textures, flavors, and temperatures were spot on. Mind, officially, blow",

I have been wanting to try this place since I relocated to Phoenix several years back but I wasn't willing to go here unless I, A.) Went with a major foodie like myself  B.) Had the opportunity to try the omkase   So when such unicorn stars aligned I was so excited to check this place off of my list (finally!).   Now, I have like you (presumably) if your reading this, have always heard such amazing things about Nobou and his James Beard Winning restaurant. But I, if we are going full disclosure on things wasn't expecting it to be this damn good! From the first bite to the last sip of sake, Nobou and his culinary genius just wowed me. The food was simple, yet so well thought out, and to put the horn on the unicorn Nobou was charming and funny and I left wanting him to be my new bff.    Now, I can't sit here and tell you about every single bite I ate, but what I can tell you is that you are simply doing yourself a disservice by not hurrying and making the next possible reservation to experience what I did.   What can I tell you? I left with wisdom, I left drinking a ridiculously good bottle of Arizona Sake (seriously, it was delicious!), I may have gotten talked into eating an eyeball from a fish and I left eating what will be known as one of the best meals I have ever had.   So read my lips errrr my text... The hype is no hype, this shiz is real deal.",

Besides the charming exterior that grabs your attention as you walk in, the interior is even better! It's small and intimate. I had the chicken katsu curry, and I have to admit that it's the best katsu curry I've had all over Phoenix (and I've been on the hunt for about a year now)! I came right before they closed between the lunch and dinner times, so it was empty. The service was still flawless and my friend and I enjoyed our time here.  It is a bit pricy, and I wish the lunch menu had more options.  We parked on the garage and validated our ticket for dining here. Overall, I'd come back again for a cute date night.",

Was super excited to come and try the summer bento box lunch special they were offering.   Pro's ~Loved that there were many options to choose from for the bento box. I picked the Grilled Mackerel, Grilled Tofu, and Braised Pork Belly Bun. I was bummed that I didn't get to try the short rib salad but because they were out but we did also come 45 minutes before lunch was ending so that makes sense. ~Everything was super tasty and was just the right portion size, I left feeling full and was happy that I got to taste a little bit of everything. ~ Love the quaint little house and the intimate space. It was perfect for an afternoon date and we will definitely be coming back for dinner. They played great music too! ~Our drinks were never empty, our server did a great job at always making sure we were taken care of.  Con's  ~Parking..but let's be honest parking downtown is just a pain in the a** anyways. You can get validated if you park in the lot that is just west of the restaurant and walk thru the parking garage. I made the mistake of parking in the parking structure that was to the south of the science center. Make sure to take your ticket in with you while you dine so they can validate you  ~Price..I think the price is in line with the quality of food you get but I would like to see it maybe include the beverage as well at least for the lunch special.  We will definitely be coming back to have dinner for sure!",

I had an event near by but since my time was limited and I didn't have time to stop to eat before arriving, when I saw this place I walked in. I mentioned I only have 25 mins but they happily welcomed in and made some recommendations on food for a quick meal. It was a bit early for dinner time and I had a late lunch that day, so I just ordered salad.  Warm duck salad was not what I thought it was going to be as a salad. It exceeded my imagination and I truly enjoyed my warm duck salad. I think I had a certain image for salad and what they served here was outside the box. Perfect little appetizer, just right portion size for what I needed at that time.  Lovely ambiance, loved nice small touch to the decor, perfect for a date night, I just need to find one, lol.",

    "text": "I am disappointed to leave such a poor review of this restaurant, after how excited my (6-person) family was to support and experience the work of this James Beard Award-winning chef featured in the Phoenix Film Festival documentary, \"Kakehashi: Portrait of Chef Nobuo Fukuda.\"    In full disclosure, we visited Nobuo during Restaurant Week, so we did not have the benefit of trying items on the full menu.  Still, quality should not be shirked when your customers are paying $44 for vegetables, a bento box (choice of beef or seafood), and dessert.  I will say the cocktails hit the spot. I can see myself enjoying one on their quaint deck on a warm summer evening.  This said...the service was mediocre and unmemorable.  We felt like the staff barely acknowledged our presence.  Our food was well-timed but equally underwhelming.  The bento box was beautifully plated.  Included was some white rice and salad dressed with the traditional ginger dressing.  However, the entrees were cold aside from the mushroom dish which I didn't care for.  The fried, soft-shell crab was my favorite with mango slaw - but room temperature.  The seared tuna was also a little tough when it should melt in your mouth.  The desserts were GROSS - and I found what looked like a ball of thread or some other thready object in my brother's pudding.  We left it right on top of the plate, hoping someone might see it as we left.    My mother in particular was excited to pay tribute to Chef Nobuo and, given the slow Saturday evening, thought he might greet his patrons at some point during the meal, as is typically expected in fine dining - at least a nice touch.  Instead she caught him standing behind the counter, texting, seemingly without awareness that there was a dinner service flowing around him.  She stood by for a few seconds hoping to get his attention but he ignored her.    I very much hope this was an off night for Chef Nobuo and his staff - I hate to think the quality of the food and service was compromised just because he (voluntarily) turned less of a profit.  Unfortunately for this family of six, first impressions are everything and the exorbitant expense doesn't really justify a second chance.  :-(",

    "text": "Lindsey here, reporting to you live from a self-induced food coma thanks to the delicious cuisine courtesy of Nobuo.   Let's see...where shall I begin?   I finally had the perfect excuse to check a visit to Nobuo off my list: Yelp Eats! So tonight, fellow yelpers and myself sat in the adorable Teeter house and dined on master cuisine. I began with the refreshing watermelon and goat cheese salad. It was like a never-ending bowl of melon that was perfectly matched with creamy goat cheese.   As our table laughed and chatted about everything under the sun, I ordered another appetizer: the teeter tots. Holy tots Napoleon! At first glance, the idea of tofu teeter tots didn't appeal to me too much, but I'm a sucker for anything fried so I decided to give it a try. Well, the fried tofu was smothered with mouthwatering sweet sauce and after one taste, the rest of the table ordered a dish for themselves! In fact, they were so good, Dave N ate them again for dessert! Even if you aren't a tofu lover, I still suggest you get them. They are heavenly.   Now let's move on to the entrees. I had half of the soft shell crab sandwich dish and half of the pork belly steamed buns. Both were crafted perfectly. The pork belly steamed buns come on a rice bun and the pork and sauce are complimented perfectly within the bun. The soft shell crab sandwich comes with two small sandwiches. The crab melts in your mouth and the sauce is the perfect addition. If you go with a friend, order both dishes and share!   We ended the night with a sweet goodbye known as the orange almond fritters. Imagine four donut holes with ice cream on top and covered in a thick Carmel/orange-like sauce. Perfecto!   The atmosphere here is wonderful as well because it's situated in the historic Teeter house. In fact, tonight I learned that this house was occupied by the owner until her death in the 1970s. It's truly a piece of Phoenix history and worth stopping into even if it's just to see the house. But do yourself a favor and stay to dine as well!",

I really hope so (I really want to go back), but each portion of our meal was served individually, took forever, we had to eat our meals separately, and they broke our water glass and it spilled all over the table.  They offered free dessert but we had to get a move on as the ballet started at 7.  We assumed arriving with a reservation right away at 5:30 would be fine and it was quiet at the restaurant.  Clearly it didn't make a difference.  We'll probably go somewhere else in the future for special occasions and hopefully brave another dining adventure here when we're not trying to get somewhere else.  (though I'm still upset over our mains coming out at different times, after the other, with huge breaks of time between; it was ridiculous).",

    "text": "If cost is of no concern, and you don't mind spending $4 per bite, then this restaurant is the one for you.  The food (or more correctly, each bite) tasted phenomenal, and you can see and taste the attention to detail and the creativity in each dish.  So to be fair, you're not just throwing away your hard-earned money.  I just wish there was more on each plate to enjoy and savor.    Like I said, the whole meal was excellent, and the venue and ambiance are both extraordinary (old bungalow converted to restaurant, so you're eating in small rooms that hold 4 or 5 tables each at most).  Very intimate, cozy, and relaxed.  All of the cold courses were great - hamachi with grapefruit, grilled octopus with tomato and mozzarella (it somehow all worked together), and the oysters with uni.     Ordered several warm dishes, with the warm duck salad surprisingly being the best dish of the whole night.  I was a little hesitant to order the salad because it just sounded a little weird, but it's absolutely a must-get.  The grilled greens imparted a smoky flavor to the dish, and paired with the rare duck, this salad has to be one of the best dishes in the city.  The sea bass cooked in parchment was just okay, and only had 5 or 6 forkfuls at most.  There were also a couple of Japanese single-malt whiskeys that were pretty decent.  Do you know which country produces the most single-malts in the world after the #1 producer (Scotland)?    Nice upscale experience, nice atmosphere, great delectable dishes, and great drinks, but very expensive.  Is it worth it?  Sometimes you just can't put a price on awesome food served in unique ways in a unique environment.  All I know is, we scooted on over to Bianco right after paying the bill and polished off a couple of pies each.  Two great restaurants right next to each other, with each chef being skilled and masterful in his own right, but only one leaving me fully satisfied.",

    "text": "IMPORTANT:  You will spend $50 per person here, and walk away slightly full, NOT stuffed.  You need to get that through your head to enjoy this place.  I dropped $110 including tip, and no alchoholic drinks between my wife and myself (just one iced tea).  We had 9 dishes, including 3 appetizer, 3 \"entree\" and 3 small deserts.     We ate everything on every plate... and at the end of the night, we still could have easily eaten more.    So this isn't a place you go to \"fill up.\"  Budget $50 easy per person, then when you get there, SPEND it all on dishes.  And have absolutely no regrets, because you've prepared yourself.  And then be prepared to be blown away by the tastes and presentation of each dish.  Each dish comes out for the table one at a time, maybe 10 minutes apart.  Each will inevitably be deemed \"delicious\" by all a the table.  Each will likely be the best version of whatever it is, you've tasted for a long while... maybe ever.  Seabass and Mushrooms in white paper.   I've never had fish that tasted like that... and the mushrooms blew my mind.  Tofu fried tater tots... absolutely delicious.    Soft shelled crab sliders... amazing.  Maybe my favorite.  The pork in the buns was the most \"normal dish\", but terribly good.  It was really all very outstanding.  Perhaps one of the best \"date\" restaurants if you want to blow some money, that I've found in Phoenix.  Of course I couldn't have afforded it when I was dating... so small problem.  But if dropping $100 on amazing tastes and flavors and not at least being thoroughly full at the end bothers you, don't go, as it will be an exercise in frustration.  No point being stressed about the money you are spending.  There is a place for restaurants like this.  And they are terrific.  But you have to get your mind straight.  I will be back.  Sorry if I come across as a cheap bastard with expensive tastes... but... I am.  And Nobuo is worth every penny.",

On this particular night, I had the Yellowtail Sashimi, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, and for dessert, another appetizer....the Teeter Tots. Yes, two entrees, and an appetizer for dessert. It was that damn good.  Don't waste time reading any more reviews. Just go. Nobuo. Now.",

But this is where Nobuo ultimately fails - if you want to come on at this price point and position at the top, you've got to nail it on all levels.  Service here was amateur at best and while top notch, the food wasn't as good as what you'd expect were you to go to a similar level restaurant in LA or NYC.  Nobuo is a good four star restaurant priced and positioned as a five star experience - it's good but I wouldn't go back.",

We started out with heirloom cauliflower that was on the small bite menu. It was nice and simple, roasted and served with a sesame dressing. I love that everything is Tapas style so you can try several dishes. Next was the grapefruit & hamachi - this is heaven in your mouth!!! Perfectly portioned in large spoons with avocado and white truffle ponzu oil, it was the best dish of the night.   We then went into the warm dishes, the warm duck salad. There was quite a bit of duck, served nearly rare. It was great, had some smokey elements to it because of the grilled greens. I think next time I'd opt for the seabass & mushroom - the table next to us was raving about it. Our final dish was the shiromi carpaccio which was incredible, they poured hot oil at the table over the top so it seared the meet. PERFECTION! Then a few minutes later they bring out warm focaccia so you can use the oil and seasonings to dip the bread.  Dessert was a pumpkin flan with Chinese 5-spice ice cream. The perfect end to the night. Polished off with a bottle of Sake and you've got yourself a perfect evening in a beautiful historic home turned restaurant.",

I was very excited to find they had okonomiyaki, and while there is only one kind of okonomiyaki that they will make, it was delicious, and actually better than okonomiyaki that I've had in San Francisco.  It was perfectly grilled, with a lot of vegetable and meat, with lots of flavor.  I also tried the steamed buns, which are the type that look more like Asian tacos rather than meat enclosed in white puffy bun, but tasted very good nonetheless.  If I am in this area, I will definitely be going here to try more items.",

On our server's recommendation we ordered two cold dishes and three hot dishes, which they then coursed out for us in the manner they best saw fit.   Everything was delicious and you could tell that every single element was very carefully chosen and crafted. While we didn't have a single bad dish, I did slightly prefer the cold options. The Hassun mixed vegetable appetizer was a favorite - I love that you get an omakase selection of different preparations.   The house itself is small, but feels full of history. It really is quite quaint and an intimate dining experience. Very unique.   Overall, while on the pricier side, we felt that we got our money's worth. We definitely hope to be back again!",

I wouldn't recommend going during the restaurant weeks though. The menu and the presentation were spot on during our recent trip to the restaurant. Loved how they served in amazing bento boxes however the food was cold and even the salad and accompaniments were very soggy. It didn't feel like the usual Nobu standard that we have come to expect esp. since the soggy items and cold miso cod made me cringe and feel as if the food wasn't freshly made.",

Favorites include oysters and grapefruit and hamachi. I had really wanted uni with oysters but they were unavailable at the time. The grapefruit went really well with the fish. I did not like the house salmon because it had parmesan cheese on top and was very strange tasting The warm plates were pretty good. The black cod was definitely the standout dish.

Finally I too know what all the fuss is about. The flavors meld together beautifully, these complex flavors with layers balance perfectly in every dish. Multiple times I had to close my eyes to better taste the food. Service is great. All of the wait staff seem to genuinely care about the food they are serving you and wanting you to understand it and enjoy. The black cod might have been the beat single bite of food I've had in a long time. The grapefruit and hamachi, which we started with, was so good I thought it was going to be the best thing we had. There were at least two other dishes that were as good or better, like the carpaccio, the Saikyo Yaki, the clams and mushrooms and the cod. Definitely the grapefruit hamachi (I think that's what it was but I will add comments to photos. I will post the beers also, which were fantastic amd paired well. I apologize that I do not know the names of what I ordered, I took photos of the set menu, which we did not ordered, we ordered much more and mostly hot dishes.",

The food was pretty good, I always laugh at how we start off with the $44 restaurant Week menu and somehow our bill comes out closer to $200 for my wife and I.  While the actual Restaurant Week menu wasn't all that, we had some really amazing Foie Gras!  We may be back again for a really special occasion and maybe try some sushi.  The restaurant was packed (as I figured it would be) even though it was a week night.  Space is pretty tight to begin with so expect to be somewhat crammed in.  The staff is great, super friendly but this is definitely one of those social places where you take your time with dinner.",

    "text": "Located in an old house which has been converted into a restaurant with quiet books of tables, Nobuo has an upscale version of Japanese izakaya style plates, along with fusion, modernized takes on sashimi. It's a little on the pricier side, but every bite is definitely delicious.   I had a glass of smooth junmai ginjo sake, which was served in a wine glass. I ordered three things, which was just enough for one person: a plate of assorted Japanese side dishes; black saikyo yaki with daikon and carrot slaw; and the yellowtail sashimi, which was presented in perfect bites rolled with shiso leaf. The presentation was gorgeous. The flavors were light but complex.   The food was great but felt a little odd being in an upscale setting. It's definitely a great choice for great quality Japanese food but I would not go out of my way to try this place (I'm Japanese). I'll try to come back and make a reservation for the chef's tasting and re-evaluate then.",

We started with their tuna sashimi over a beet puree. It was super tasty! For my entree, I got their cold short rib noodle salad. The dressing was refreshing and the flavors fab, the portion just wasn't very big for the price. The beef was sliced super thin and there wasn't a ton of it. But hey, I had just come off of a big workout so maybe my ravenous self is being unrealistic.   Overall, cute little spot in Heritage Square with friendly service. I could see it being very romantic at night. Be sure to check the hours because I think they take a break between lunch and dinner. The reason for my 4 stars is that it is pricy for the portion sizes and there isn't a ton to choose from on the menu. For 2 of us to eat lunch it was over $60. Anywho, I'd give it another shot!",

    "text": "The last time I came to Nobuo was about 3 years ago and I remembered being blown away. I always talk to my bf about how good the food I had was so he surprised me with a reservation for our anniversary. The last time I visited I would have rated the place 5 stars.  I have to say that although my experience last night didn't match up to the experience I had a few years ago, there were still many high notes of the dinner.   We started out with the Graptefruit Hamachi (the dish that I've dreamed about for the past 3 years) and it was great. There is so much flavor in just one bite and I love the acidity from the citrus.  (4.5 stars)  Next plate was the House-Cured Salmon. Don't order this. It's bad, not worth 18. Just a bad dish tbh because the star should be the salmon but the cheese gets in the way. It was only palatable when completely slathered with the balsamic.(1 Star)  We also ordered the nanban chicken. If you look at my uploaded photo of the dish, you can imagine how disappointing it would be to be served slightly raw chicken, especially at an establishment that prices their plates between $18-20+ each. The chef gladly sent our plate back and luckily our next dish came out short after.  When we got this plate the second time, is was fully cooked. The flavor of the chicken was great and I really loved the breading. However, I feel that the potato salad that they put on top really does a disservice to the dish as a whole because it neutralizes the flavors of everything else. Kind of like using a fire extinguisher to put out a fire. (3 stars)     The pork belly banana leaf dish was next, and it was our favorite item of the night. This dish is a MUST. The mushroom fried rice is so tasty and the pork belly just melts in your mouth. I wish we would have ordered 2 plates of this dish because it was just sooo good. (5*+ stars)  The yellowtail ceviche was our last dish of the night was recommended by the chef. This was my second favorite of the night. I love ceviche and Nobuo figured out how to make one spoonful satisfying enough to be happy. There is the citrus from the lime and a crunch from the crips they sprinkled on top. (4 stars)  Overall, if it's your first time visiting I would definitely recommend the pork belly, hamachi, and ceviche. Definitely ask questions about the menu because the servers and chef were more than happy to help us at our dinner.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have had Nobuo on our radar for a long time now - seeing it every Restaurant Week season. We finally went to celebrate our anniversary and it definitely did not disappoint.   We both did the omakase - Call in advance and make sure you reserve for omakase. They need at least a week I think - I called a month ahead. You get to sit at a cute little bar away from the main dining area where usually 4  people enjoy omakase for the night. If you have not done a little research of your own, I believe it was around $180 per person - but I'll tell you now. It's worth every penny! Hands down the best meal I've ever had!   We started off with a really good pot of hojicha green tea. It had a wonderful roasted flavor to it and it was unlimited refills on your little tea pot (at least I think). The first course had 9 little dishes that were simply amazing. (Top row left to right) This row featured some of my favorites of the night - an amazing steamed egg with shrimp and mushrooms topped with caviar and edible gold flake (top 3 of the night). It was so simple, yet the umami was on a God-tier level.. blew my mom's steamed egg dish out of the water (sorry mom). Then there was a tofu made in-house with soy milk from Japan and fresh wasabi (my girlfriend's favorite). The last in that row was a savory egg custard that actually blew me away. I believe this was the dish he blow torched like a brulee. It was easily my favorite of the night.   (2nd row left to right) We had a local summer squash blossom tempura which was very good. This was the last batch of summer squash blossom for the season, so obviously, you'll get different vegetables depending on what time of year you go. There was also a watermelon salad drizzled with olive oil and yuzu along with goat cheese and mint. It was so good, it honestly made me question if savory watermelon was better than just plain sweet watermelon. The last dish on the row was eggplant with 2 different kinds of imported miso. I've never had miso outside of soup/ramen, so this was great. Favorite dish of the night.  (3rd row left to right) We had shoshito peppers with freshly shaved bonito flakes. Pickled radishes that were whole, but sliced so crazily, the texture was unlike anything I've ever had. And lastly, local ocra in a really good peanut (?) sauce. I actually dipped my tempura in this too.  The 2nd course was the sashimi spoons. You'll have to forgive my memory, but this was about a month ago so I could get em mixed up. To Nobuo's advice, we ate from right to left. There was a fresh oyster and uni (excellent), smoked salmon in basil oil, yellowtail with ginger, tuna, amazing amberjack in a soy sauce and olive oil sauce that reminded me of mom's cooking, octopus over tomato, marinated tuna, and mint wrapped with amberjack.   The 3rd course was the fish n chips. I'm not sure if we were told what fish, but it was steamed perfectly and had a great sauce that was a little sweet. Perfect for me since I love sweet and savory dishes. The fried fish that served as the bowl was also edible, bones and all. The 4th course was the bird cooked in some weird yoga pose. Don't let it freak you out, cause it tasted amazing. Again, I can't remember the type of bird, but Nobuo said it took 3-4 days to prepare. Well worth the wait! He carved it up for both of us to split.   5th course was the shabu shabu. First time experiencing this and it was fun! We each got our own little flame and paper filter of dashi. By now I was already pretty full, but we still got a generous portion of imported wagyu beef, sashimi, cabbage, and mushrooms to cook. This all set up our 6th course which was a soup that used our broth from the shabu shabu and had some smoked clams mixed in. Lastly, was the dessert... Beautiful to look at, better to eat. It was a white peppercorn cheesecake with berries and fresh figs. You may think white peppercorn and cheesecake don't mix, but the lady that did desserts made it work and it was delicious.   I definitely plan to go back, but it'll have to be for another special occasion. Nobuo is very friendly and you can tell that he has lot of love and passion for what he does. I'll say it again, this was the best meal I've ever had. I know there aren't many reviews out there for Nobuo's omakase, so hopefully this helps those that are interested and sways your decision.",

What I found instead was an amazing Japanese food experience in an interesting setting.  Interesting setting in a good way rather, in that it's set in a beautiful home with tables and a bar seating setup (which I took advantage of ) and located in a quiet and safe setting with valet parking available adjacent.  As soon as you walk up and inside, it instantly feels like you're transported to another place and time. The hosts and service staff are wonderful and make you feel at home.   Foodwise, I took a ride on their omakase style $100 meal option. The server provided stories on the ingredients and inspiration for each serving that really rounded out the food experience and made it memorable. EVERY single item that came out was not only fun to witness from a presentation perspective, but every bite - and I mean every bit - was absolutely fulfilling.   I enjoyed my dining experience here so much that I made sure to tell all my Phoenix friends about it. This was a great visit and food EXPERIENCE.

A must try is the miso Foie gras, hamachi grapefruit, and the duck salad was all so amazing. This chef has an exceptional palette. It gets 5 stars in my book",

It was almost hard to put into words how much my friends and I enjoyed our meal.  We actually went here by luck.  The dinner party consisted of my two best foodie friends that night.  We had planned to go to Pizzeria Bianco that night after walking around First Fridays.  \"Fortunately\" the wait that night was over two and a half hours (normally only an hour if you go after 9:30pm).  By chance I saw Nobuo directly across from Pizzeria Bianco so I whipped out my trusty iPhone Yelp AP and proceeded to investigate Nobuo.  The reviews were great so we decided to give it a try.  That my friend was the beginning of my renewed faith in cultured dining in AZ.  We were luckily seated right away that night as it was pretty late already.  The restaurant was cozy and comfortable in a minimalistic classic decor with a few well place Japanese artwork.  We decided to order about 6 dishes from the menu.  2 from the cold dishes side and 4 from the warm side.  1st bite - Grapefruit and Hamachi: This was a very pretty looking dish.  There were 4 spoon servings of delicately prepared Hamachi wrapped around a small slice of grapefruit and avocado with white truffle ponzu oil topped with a sliver of ginger on top.  We each put the bite into our mouths and was transcended to what many would describe as a religious culinary experience.  The flavors literally just burst into your mouth.  Visually you were expecting one thing but the flavor profiles you taste was just simply amazing.  My friends and I looked at each other with the same amazement.  Ok this will be a novel by the time I finish the other 5 courses. I will cut it short by saying it is by far one of the best food experiences I've had in AZ.  Nobuo is not inexpensive, but for this level of quality and experience -  it's worth every cent.",

    "text": "One vegetarian item on the entire dinner menu (an appetizer of snap peas), but the kitchen was willing to make an item from their lunch menu for me: a charred tofu salad with noodles and ginger sauce. It was delicious. Their appetizer of vegetables (hassun I think it's called) has a few things normally fried in beef fat so they were able make substitutions. It was also delicious. The potato flight (an alcohol like vodka) was interesting...definitely worth trying.  We sat outside, which was nicely done with strings of lights and candles. They had wooden benches/tables and then some round tables with metal patio chairs. We sat at the latter and it was very uncomfortable...the round table didn't work well for putting the very large dishes on along with the flight of alcohol, and the chairs were very awkward. There was a seat cushion for the back of the chair but I put the seat cushion on my derriere because it's hard sitting on those waffle-metal chairs after awhile...you end up with a grid on your leg or butt when you get up. Also, because you're eating, you want to sit up--at the table where your plate is--to eat your food and that's very difficult to do in these chairs because they're patio furniture...you're supposed to lean back and relax in them. If you like that while eating dinner, the outside area will work great for you!  Overall, it has cozy but casual feeling, but I wouldn't recommend the outside seating to anyone with a backache or who's planning a more relaxed dinner where they want to sit and enjoy their meal for more than 1/2 an hour.",

It happened to be First Friday.   We had ridden the light rail downtown to the AZ Science Center and thought we'd walk around to see what, if anything, exciting was going on.   The owner's, Nobuo, wife served us.   I ordered wine and I don't remember what my companion ordered.   Either a beer or wine.    I didn't pay attention.   I believe Nobuo's wife's name is Sarah.   My companion mentioned to her that he had met the owner prior, whereupon Nobuo came out to say \"hi,\" and we had a short chat.    Both are such friendly and charming people.  Very, very gracious and not the typical \"full of himself\" type of person that I've experienced with other restaurateurs around the valley who are world renowned.",

Nobuo's culinary creations are artfully and beautifully presented.  Each one will have your taste buds BEGGING for more.  Every dish I tasted was, frankly, perfect.    A bite of Nasu (eggplant, bacon, red miso, Tokyo negi) will have you craving another order.  How ON EARTH is eggplant so damn delish???  Grapefruit & Hamachi was light, yet zesty and tasty.   The Big-Eye Tuna Tataki was one of my absolute favorties.  I almost bit the servers arm when she tried to take the plate still smeared with that roast beet puree.  It had the thickness of tomato paste and it was SO GOOD that I wanted to LICK THE PLATE!  I almost ripped the parchment bag keeping us from the Seabass & Mushroom.

The Teeter house's dining areas are sectioned off into different rooms, so the atmosphere is intimate and kind of romantic I came to dinner with a party of six and we each ordered three tapas (which are all portioned off to share) and split them among the group over a span of three hours. The dining experience is a constant stream of small portions, but it's relaxing and exciting all at once. I strongly recommend this as a date spot or just a place to take your family out of their comfort zone.

In what could be described as Izakaya Fusion small plates, or what one might call \"Japa Tapas\",  made with attention to detail, flavor and texture, at reasonable prices, this place was part of Phoenix  Yelp's Eats Week recently, with rave reviews from Yelp Foodies.  In a cozy, quiet room with only 4 tables, with dark hardwood floors and minimal decorations, the two of us split the following:  Small Bites Kimchi ($6) - napa cabbage, dried shrimp, seasme oil, red chili.  Instead of the Korean staple fermented and limp, this was fresh cabbage with a lively flavor, crisp and crunchy, as a salad rather than a pickled side dish. Excellent!  Nasu ($8) - eggplant, bacon, red miso, Tokyo negi - this small bacon wrapped morsels stuffed with eggplanbt and akamiso, with shaveed green onions. (8 small pieces) Heavenly!   Others not tried: Shishito Pepper, Watermelon Goat Cheese salad, Tempura Squash Blossom (All $10 or less)  Cold Dishes Yellow Tail Ceviche ($14) - myouga, sesame seed, sherdded taro - a superb blend of textures from the Hamachi to the Taro shavings, caressing the palatte with sultry pleasure (4 pieces)  Tako and Tomato ($16) - fresh grilled octupus, house made mozzarella - like a mini-Italian Caprese appetizer, with half a cherry tomato, a small ball of mozzarella, a touch of basil, and a scored, pounded, grilled tender piece of white octupus! Outrageous yet comforting in its combining recognition with a new ingredient!   Others not tried: House cured Salmon, Ebi Salad, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Shiromi Carpaccio, Big Eye Tuna Tataki (all $12 - $16)  Warm Dishes Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich ($12) -  housemade focaccia, cucumber, kanzuri aioli - this is not your daddy's crab sandwich! Crispy soft shell, great aioli, a mouth watering delight!  Seabass & Mushroom ($14) - seabass baked in parchment, garlic butter, sake, soy - delicate, flaky seabass soaking in a hearty sauce, on a bed of shitaki and enoki mushrooms, with a sweet sake, butter and onion base, tender, yet dripping with exciting goodness like a goddess in heat!  Others not tried: Okonomiyaki ($8) - classic Kansai pancake favorite!  Pork Belly Buns, Fried Sodt Shell Shrimp, Warm Duck Salad, Yuan Yaki, Foie Gras, Coconut Curry Lamb, (all $10 - $24)  Dessert Chcolate Mouse with Green Tea Ice cream and chocolate syrup  This is a terrific date place, intimate and romantic, or a Foodies orgasm, and all at reasonable prices for the quality of creations and food. We had 2 small bottles of Junmai Sake ($12 eacch) but they have a huge selction of sakes going up to near $600 a bottle, as well as a good selction of beers. Relaxed atmoshere, not hoity toity at all, not attitudes, very down to earth.   This is an excellent choice! And of my many reviews, only 10% or less get 5 stars from Wanugee, so you can trust my viewpoint and bell curve!",

    "text": "No recommendations. Had the hamachi with grapefruit and truffle oil. Also had the pork belly buns. Came here for lunch. Hamachi tasted amazing, the white truffle oil added a delicious taste along with the contrast of the bitter-sweet grapefruit; this dish is genius. However, at $16/plate where each plate comes with 4 pieces, and given that the hamachi was was paper thin, I would not recommend this dish. The pork belly buns come with two per plate at $10. Very tasty and a genius idea. However, the pork belly needs to be slow-cooked more to soften the meat more prior to broiling as it was quite chewy.  All In all, I would eat here again in the future to see if things improve.",

Little did I know that we have a restaurant in downtown Phoenix that is tucked away in heritage square that is the best meal I've ever had.   I was celebrating the birthday of a boyfriend at the time and I wanted to do go somewhere that was really special and offered a unique taste on Asian food.  I drove around the city trying to confuse him and I made reservations through Open Table so we were able to get seated right away.  The inside is small but offers a very intimate feel and would be perfect to celebrate any occasion.    I believe that the menu varies throughout the year and the combination of flavors and tapas style dishes allowed us to try a little bit of everything.  Our waiter made wonderful recommendations and explained how we should start our meal with lighter dishes and venture of into some of the more intricate dishes later on.  I wish I could remember his name because he was amazing!!  We had dishes that combined exotic mushrooms, rice, pork belly, and tuna.  Each dish was better than the last one and we couldn't pick which one was our favorite at the end.    They honored my wish of not singing happy birthday and they brought out a dessert that was amazing.  We had a wonderful time at this restaurant and our meal was even better.",

    "text": "I went to Nobuo for my birthday this year, and it was definitely the highlight on my celebration. The food was amazing. I had never experienced Japanese food like this, and I am dying to go back. Not only is the food delicious, the food is beautiful, and (most of it) was light while still satisfying. My favorite dish was the Carpacio - a dish I now dream about.   The service was fine, but not spectacular. The staff was not rude, but not terribly friendly either, and seemed a bit \"too cool for school\". The meal was perfectly paced (for me), but I could see some thinking it was a bit slow. If you go with friends or loved ones you probably won't mind the 5 - 15 minutes between dishes, but it could make for an uncomfortable first date.   Other than that, the ambiance is great, and I didn't find it to be terribly expensive. My boyfriend and I shared 5 dishes and each had a beer, and came in at about $75 (including tip). We left feeling the perfect amount of full - content but not heavy. I've seen many comments about the price and to that I say: This is a place you go to have a food experience - not stuff yourself. Plus the guy won a James Beard award!!! You pay for what you get, and in this instance, what you get is amazing, and a reasonable price!",

Chef Nubuo was there and he personally prepared these dishes for us but I was hoping to find something that my grandmother would make for me like Chawan Mushi but in truth I've found a global fusion (Pan Asian, Continental) cuisine with Japanese flavor which means he seasoned a little heavy to my palate.  His appetizer nearly destroyed by taste bud (Grilled Chili-boy that was spicy which I had to wash down with green tea to ease the pallets my tongue). The food was 5 star but the service is quite spotty.  The server admitted that he is quite inexperienced but eager to learn new things which is rare among the service staff of today.  Hot green tea were served with two teapots but unfortunately the server did not warm the Japanese pot which made the tea very cold (later he remedied it with additional hot water.  Chopsticks were the the cheapest wooden kind--it has no place in this type of restaurant where the food is premium.  Two demerits there.   Like a typical exotic restaurants in Japan and Italy, the menu changes with the inspiration of the chef who gathers for the seasonal flavors of the time, therefore you will probably not get the same meal twice but it is rather very exciting and creative cooking that is in par with very exclusive restaurants that is worthy of high Michelin stars ratings.  Goose liver (Foie Gras) was absolute spectacular.  To have full experience, be prepared to spend $100+ for dinner for two.  If you want a typical Japanese meal, this is not the place for it.  It is a trendy place with the eclectic global fusion cuisine in the heart of Heritage Square of Downtown Phoenix for new generation of Japanese cooking with international flare.",

This place is also one of the only I can think of where you can find the words ceviche, yellowtail, and carpaccio all in one menu.   I brought my wife here and, to our surprise, they were having a \"Yelp Special\" where select dishes were half off. We ordered 6 dishes: Watermelon Goat Cheese, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Tomato & Clam Ceviche, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, Seabass & mushroom, & Pork Belly Buns. It was the right amount of food for us. All the dishes were very interesting and unorthodox. Oddly the flavors tended towards acidic and tangy versus savory. The food was novel, but I still preferred the taste of the more authentic Japanese style of soft shell crab, seabass, and pork belly bun.   With the Yelp Special, we saved $22. Even with that discount, we still spent around $80 for 2. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the price range is realistically $$$ ($31-60) per person.   The fusion food certainly makes for a novel experience, but is not always better.",

We checked in and found out there was a 60-90 minute wait, so we left our phone number and headed to Rose and Crown for a drink and a small appetizer to tide us over. After about 15 minutes, they called and told us our table ready. We just took our Rose and Crown snacks to go. I ordered us around of the Orion beer, which was great dinner beer. We started with the Teeter Tots, lightly fried tofu in this sweet somewhat spicy sauce with bacon. HOLY COW!! I've NEVER EVER had tofu that good.  We ended up getting a second order. We also got the Japanese eggplant with red miso and bacon, totally great. The largest plate we ordered were the coconut curry grilled lamb chops. They were seriously the best lamb chop I've ever had. They had this coconut curry crust on them, cooked rare served with this mango/meyer lemon salad. Just killer. We also had the steam buns with pork belly, another homerun. All total between the 4 beers, one cocktail and 5 dishes we had, the total damage was around $90. Every penny well worth it, sooo excited to go back!!",

I don't know what it was, but I was damn hungry and not down for waiting what was almost three hours for pizza.     I saw across the way what looked the most cozy and inviting place ever. Having already solved the case of why is my stomach empty and my partner in that case noticed I was starting to get grouchy, we decided to check it out.      We were seated almost immediately and I swear our server was Jake Gyllenhaal. So we will refer to him as such. So my lady friend, who had already had a few glasses from Bar Bianco, was intrigued by sake. We asked Mr. Gyllenhaal what he would recommend from someone who had never had such. Mr. Darko recommended his favorite sake and it was incredible. I can't thank Jack Twist enough for introducing me to something between beer and Riesling.     We order steamed pork buns and that is about the last thing I remember. Sake is damn strong and tastes fantastic with the wonderful food we had.   Thank you Jake Gyllenhaal. You are a gentleman and a scholar.  TIL: Sake has replaced Dr. Pepper",

Since we were ok with not having a table in the main dining room but along a bar on the wall we waited less than 5 minutes. We choose from each of the selections and all were exquisite, the pork belly buns were melt in your mouth delicious. The sea bass in parchment was, buttery, flaky and the enoki mushrooms added just the right earthy undertone. The table favorite was a light white fish that has hot oil poured over it with homemade foccacia. We ordered 2 we liked it so much! We also had the house cured salmon with basil oil, I had to stop myself from licking the plate. We had 3 more dishes, but you get the idea...   The only thing I would change is the pace of the service, it was way to fast to please me on a Saturday night date. The portion sizes are small and I would have like to savor them more. Unfortunately our servings were brought out so quickly we sometimes had 2 or 3 in front of us. Next time I will just ask them to slow their roll.  With 3 drinks, dessert and tip we spent roughly $130, well worth every penny. I will definitely be back~",

    "text": "We'd driven from Scottsdale to try Pizza Bianco, which had a two hour wait; we looked around the immediate vicinity and saw Nobuo right across the way. I Yelped it, skimmed the reviews, and we decided to give it a go.    Named after the chef and owner, Nobuo, the menu frequently changes to compliment the fresh fish imported from Japan.   The restaurant is located in a restored historical building called the Teeter House. The decor is of nouveau elegance; the wood floors, warm-colored walls and refined decorative touches make for a very unique setting. Nobuo collects art and ceramics from around the world; I enjoyed the meal even more by simply taking in the beautiful artwork.  Each dish is smaller (tapa-sized) but packs a lot of flavor!  I like this because it allowed us to try several items from the impressive menu.  We started with Kimchi (napa cabbage, dried shrimp, sesame oil, red chili) and Sugar Snap Pea, coated with sesame dressing and bonito. Kimchi had just the right balance of sweet and savory, and the red chili added an enjoyable amount of heat.   Next came tuna flown in fresh from Japan, served sashimi style. The portion was generous and the quality exquisite. I wish it came with ginger!!  (No shaved ginger in-house, which was disappointing)   Third round was the Shiromi Carpaccio. A server brought out a plate of chilled white fish called yuzu, sprinkled with garlic, and chili flakes.  Hot sesame oil was poured on top, sizzling to slightly sear the fish.  This dish could have been spicier.  After we finished the fish the server brought out thinly sliced rounds of soft, house-made foccacia to dip in the sesame oil mixture.    Next came Ebi Salad--grilled shrimp skewers atop a bed of rice noodles, purple basil, mint, cucumber, soy glazed peanuts and nuoc cham. The salad was cool and refreshing, and the tender shrimp had just the right amount of heat.   The grand finale were the Pork Belly Buns--braised pork belly, hoisin sauce and pickled mustard greens tucked inside a delightfully chewy steamed bun made with rice flour. Perfection!  We finished the meal with one of the six green teas available. The toasted rice that steeped with the herbs created robust and balanced flavor.   All around a refreshing and satisfying adventure of Japanese flavors. Incredible.  I will forever remember this meal.",

    "text": "I went out to eat at Nobuo at the Teeter House a couple days ago, and I'm still thinking about the food. At first, I was a little intimidated by the menu, being that I could barely pronounce anything on it, or recognize half of what anything was. But after just randomly pointing to things on the menu and going with whatever I got, I was amazed. Every dish that came out was better than the last. I like that everything is tapas style, as I didn't leave in a complete food coma.   I talked to the owner for a few minutes, and he was very kind and interesting. He was talking to us about the different types of vegetables he uses and how they are locally grown.   This is a perfect date place. I loved it and I would go back over and over again.",

Since I've not had a single dish here that wasn't excellent, I'll just let you all know about some of my favorites.    For lunch, the Pork Belly Buns are a great choice.  Off their summer veg menu, the squash blossoms are terrific, and the watermelon with goat cheese is a good way to finish a light lunch.  Off the dinner menu, Tako and Tomato (tender, grilled octopus) is a favorite, and Grapefruit & Hamachi (also available at lunch) is everything you would ever want in a bite of sashimi.  And the Coconut Curry Lamb is one of the best lamb chops I've ever had.",

First time here (finally!) and I intend on coming back for more!  Came here for dinner, they do serve lunch btw which I might have to stop in for!  But here is what we had for dinner: Dishes are tapas style.  For starters had the teeter tots(scrumptious!). Then we tried soft shell crab, tako (octopus) and tomato and pork belly buns, well my date ordered that. I don`t eat pork but he sure raved about how good it was and I was sorely tempted!! Loved the sake infused cocktails to add to everything, made it complete!!   ps- get on their email list and/or follow on twitter/facebook for the latest updates! The menu changes frequently AND Nobuo does tasting dinners! I`m planning on going to one soon!! The food and wine pairings has me drooling!",

    "text": "The hubby and I had dinner here for the Yelp Eats UYE with fellow yelpers Dante M and Lucia C.  The food was fantastic and I am very happy that we were able to try all this deliciousness at half-off prices!  The best part of the meal for me was the Grapefruit & Hamachi dish.  It was amazing!  I am a big fan of sashimi and I also love grapefruit but I wasn't sure how the combination of the two would be.  Turns out it was perfect.  I was saying to my husband on the way home that this was probably the best sushi that I have ever had but then I remembered one fantastic meal at Nobu in Las Vegas.  So, I think we may have a tie there.  Which is interesting since the chefs have similar first names (Nobuo Fukuda vs. Nobu Matsuhisa).  I actually started the meal with another surprising combo.  The watermelon and goat cheese salad had a very different but overall pleasing taste to it.  The tangy creaminess of the goat cheese was a good contrast to the crisp fruity sweetness of the watermelon.  It also went really well with the cocktail I had ordered... the Cucumber Shiso.  This drink was not as good as it sounded but it was ok.  Though I may have been overly critical after enjoying the mind-blowing drinks at Citizen Public House a couple of nights before.  I did also try the White Dragon Jasmine cocktail and that was one was better.  But still not worth the $14 price tag (the menu said $11 so I'm not sure if that was a mistake or what).  Next time I will get the hibiscus iced tea that Lucia ordered since that looked lovely.  I also had some of the Pork Belly Buns as recommended by everyone and they did not disappoint.  And to finish the meal, the chocolate mousse.  That was a really awesome dessert.  I could not taste the tofu at all but I think that was the source of the ultra silky smooth texture of the mousse.  And the green tea ice cream complimented the chocolate well.  Ha, another odd yet surprisingly good combination of flavors!  Overall a great night with good food and good people in a charming atmosphere.  A high four stars.",

The place is sooo cute, the teeter house really gives you comfortable feeling as soon as you walk inside, you can really relax... great place to grub drinks all night and hang out with your date =D  I had their Tako Age, which reminded me of TAKOYAKI, japanese octupus ball treat deep fried, which was quit interesting, the yuzu mayo sauce went really well with it.   Their Oyster/Uni dish is amaaazing. I never thought tomatoe would match so well with uni!! it was also one of the  freshest I had in town =D   Their okonomiyaki really made me home sick , it really dose taste like a real thing in osaka =D  waitress was friendly, and she knew her menu,  olong tea i had was yummy too, and they have great selection of wine and sake.   Food is small portion,and it dose take a lil time to come out, but i can taste the delicate art in each dish, which to me is totally worth it. If you love food and respect art of food, you have to try this place =D  I am going back next time for his Omakase... mMmmmm Over all, I'm glad phx has at least one place thats not like other resutrants, I love this place",

Surprisingly, I was interested in numerous dishes and completely satisfied with each one and continue to up the ante on my coming of age eating habits..    The teeter tots, i could eat by the truck load, as well as the pickled watermelon radish. - Still craving these two bites.  The seabass and mushrooms were my favorite.  I had a bite or two of: the pork belly buns- soft shell crab sandwich- the okonomiyaki..all wonderful flavors, but by this point I was filling up.   To finish we split the orange fritters and throughout I had a couple Devil's Haircut cocktails...hands down, my new favorite valley cocktail.   It's always a pleasure to go to Nobuo, Sit at the bar if it's available so you can watch/chat with the magic man at work.",

So you need to order about 3 per person for a full meal.  There are only about 4-6 pieces on each plate to you won't get full if you only order 2 dishes.   We started with the Teeter Tots - panko crusted tofu in a sweet/spicy sauce. I think I could have ordered these all night long.   The pork buns, grapfruit w/ himachi, steamed clams,  and the curry lamb were all amazing.   I don't have a single complaint.  oh and they have a great beer selection - the sweet potato (I don't remember the name) was awsome.",

My friend and I split the Short Rib Steamed Buns as an appetizer.  Let me tell you this, I could eat the shit out of this all day long!  From the first bite I was in love.  Succulent meat in a light steamed bun, hmmmm.     Next my friend had the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, which unfortunately I did not try but it looked grand, and he had no complaints about it whatsoever.  I went with the Okonomiyaki.  Wow, just wow.  I have had Chinese Scallion pancakes, but this Japanese pancake was out of this world good.  I have never had anything that has ever tasted like this before.  I guess it could be best compared to an up scale Egg Foo Young.  Same concept, but with much higher quality ingredients.  What I really cannot get over was the price.  Each dish was only $10 bucks, a bargain considering the quality of food that you get.  I will put it this way.  I live in Gold Canyon, and I am willing to make the commute for these dishes again.  That sentence tells it all right there!",

I went there after an unexpectedly  great tour at the Rosson House. It was early like 3ish so a few girlfriends and I were the only ones there but that was probably what made the experience so amazing.   We sat at the bar, which is small only fits 5-6 people but Mr. Nobuo; James Beard award winner, himself was behind the bar preparing for the evening. The lady helping us said he is normally very quiet but for some reason he was an amazingly talkative host to us and made the experience impeccable!  We started with flights of Shochu which they have imported in and it was so smooth! Then we ask Nobeu to pick out a few dishes for us to try! They were absolutely amazing that we couldn't stop there and ended up getting just about everything on the menu. You know a restaurant is great when you have a girl that her diet revolves around ketchup, hamburgers and chicken nuggets and didn't have anything bad to say!  Overall it is a little spendy but worth every penny and recommend it 100%!!!!  Thanks so much for the experience and will be back soon!",

I don't really know why they have all these tables if they aren't going to fill them...   After we were seated, we looked over the menu and ordered the warm duck salad, curry lamb, hamachi grapefruit, the fluke and one of their specials. Overall the food was excellent, the duck was tasty and tender, the lamb was amazing and a must! The hamachi was good and the grapefruit complimented it well but they went a little to heavy on the sauce, I ended up pour out the sauce (it was plated on spoons) before eating it. The fluke was OK, it tasted a little off, I don't know what exactly was the problem but there was something just not quite right about it. The worst dish of the night was their special fish on the menu. They had described it in a way, where both my boyfriend and I expected it to be cooked but not deep fried. They has described it as fish that was drizzled in hot oil but when it was placed on the table, it just looked like deep fried fish balls... In addition, the fish was overcooked. The meat was dry and tough and the fish bone chips tasted burnt.   Despite that, overall I did have a good meal, while I'm not sure if the food was worth the bill (most of the dishes are very expensive) I didn't regret eating here and would go back for the lamb...

    "text": "The BF and I went to Nobuo last night for the first time with a local dines deal. The place is cute, it's an old house and you sit in one of many small rooms.  As we were seated, we overheard some other people complaining about their experience...uh oh. So, needless to say, I was a little worried. We ordered a whole bunch of things to share. We got the sugar snap peas, the fried and stuffed squash blossom, a special that was fried octopus balls (as in they were in a ball shape....stop being dirty :-P) , the sea bass and mushrooms wrapped in a pouch of sorts, and another special which was local chicken 3 ways. I also got a cocktail, the grog, and we shared the mousse for dessert (it was a pretty indulgent night). Here's the breakdown:  Sugar snap peas: this was not my fave, but the BF liked it a lot. It was a little fishy and served cold, and I just didn't totally love it, but he ate it all.   Fried squash blossom: I loved this dish! It was stuffed with goat cheese, was light and crunchy, and I thought it was soooo delicious. The BF didn't like it, but he's a goat cheese hater.   Octopus balls: The garlicky sauce was good, the breading was good, octopus has a weird texture, but overall, I liked it, they did the best they could I think with this odd ingredient.   Sea bass: This was the star of the show...the sea bass was not fishy. It fell apart. It was savory and delicious. The mushrooms were luscious, earthy, and added tons of flavor to the fish....I could eat this fish any day of the week...so yummy.   Chicken 3 ways: Again, this was pretty delicious. The chicken was served: panko fried, wasabi grilled, and marinated in a soy onion mixture. The panko fried was good, but pretty expected. The wasabi grilled was awesome, I could feel the spice in my nose and the chicken was so moist, but the clear winner on the plate was the onion soy chicken....oh em gee.... this had such a wonderful savory and sweet flavor.   The grog: This cocktail was strong! But it had a nice honey and orange flavor....definitely worth the 11$ because one was certainly enough.   The Mousse: oh so chocolately and creamy...the green tea ice cream complemented it very well (and I do not care for green tea desserts). We were told that the secret behind this (and don't read this if it might ruin your experience) is that they use tofu in it to give it that silky texture...brilliant!  Overall, I really enjoyed our meal there and would definitely go back again (although I would order a little less cuz we were stuuuuuffed).",

    "text": "The best thing about Nobuo is presentation of their plates. Our bill/person was higher than that of a 1star Michelin I've been to...and at least I left full after that meal.    Tables are awkwardly placed in cramped rooms of an old house. There was a business dinner next to us and their voices permeated the room. Our server could not recommend a Japanese beer because she had not tried them. Dishes come out with an explanation of everything on the plate...until she forgot her memorized lines...\"here we have three types of Japanese mushrooms: shiitake, enoki...and....another one that starts with and 'S'. I'll be right back.\" Weird.    We had 6 dishes: grapefruit hamachi - fish was not fresh yellowtail ceviche -good dish, i'd recommend this tako and tomato - octopus was as chewy as rubber and I don't think it pairs well with mozzarella  seabass and mushroom - fish was overcooked, too much butter, and overly salty soft shell crab salad - my half of a small crab was the best part of the meal, so good. but the salad dressing was way too acidic and overpowering pork belly - another good dish with some rice for carbs  A man handling paperwork and bills had his work spread out all over a table and couches. I thought it was weird for the setting they're trying to create. And I had to search for toilet paper and exchange their roll for them. My food, service, and ambience expectations for a restaurant slide with price, and Nobuo misses the mark. I'm happy we had a Deal Chicken coupon of $50 for $100 because I would not have come here otherwise.",

The twice washed chicken was yummy but a fatty piece had been included in my dish and was not edible. Cap it off with a leaking teapot and a highly energetic server and the meal contrasted a bit with our previous visit. A bit pricey for the quality.",

    "text": "Ever go to one of those places where the service is so bad it puts a damper on the whole experience?    After we were seated we were informed they were out of pork belly. That was a bummer because I love pork belly.  I don't have a problem with a place running out of an item, as I like stuff that's fresh.  We were then informed of the specials, and immediately Tako dumplings made me forget about the pork belly.  The waitress gave us some time to look over the menu and mentioned it's family style.  A few minutes later the waitress returned and said \"Okay we have your items ordered and let me know if you want anything else\".  When I explained that we actually never ordered yet she left and came back a couple minutes later.  \"That's right you haven't ordered\".  We proceeded to order the Tako dumplings and a few other items.  We explained that we've never been here before so we'd like to order a couple of things now and then see how the portions go.  The waitress explained that people usually order 4 dishes per person and if I didn't order them all at once they couldn't control the timing of the dishes.  So we picked the rest of our items.  A few minutes later the waitress returns to say \"We are out of Tako\".  I asked how they could be out of the dinner special when dinner rush has just started.  \"Well it's been on the board all day but when I ordered it they said we didn't have any\".  Yep this is a finely tuned restaurant where they can't be bothered to remove an item from \"the board\".    One of the dishes we ordered was a Shiromi carpaccio which came with focaccia.  The dish had a nicely heated sesame seed oil with garlic - very tasty and perfect for dipping.  If we actually had the focaccia it would have been great for dipping.  10 minutes later out comes the focaccia.  Nice controlled timing of the dishes.  The food here is pretty good.  Some items such as the kimchi with dried shrimp are very tasty.   Others such as the soft shell crab salad are nice ingredients but seem thrown together in a disjointed fashion.     Overall it's a quaint little place with pretty good dishes but you can go elsewhere and easily have a better dining experience.",

    "text": "I'm glad I took the trip here on my first day in the Phoenix area. It took me a while looking around to find a restaurant to go to and this place certainly made the effort worthwhile. In fact, I believe this is a must-go place if you are ever visiting Phoenix or its surrounding suburbs.   Location and ambiance: It's located in the Heritage Park, so your car actually cannot get anywhere close to the building. You can either do street parking or park in the heritage garage, which I think at least a part of it gets validated (at least that's what it seemed like when the server asked me while i was paying whether or not i parked in the garage). I did street parking and walked through the park, which was rather enjoyable. I didn't find the actual restaurant ambiance all that impressive though but i guess you cant do much when it's inside a historic building.   Food: I had an idea of what i wanted to order when i checked their website, but both fortunately and unfortunately, it turned out to be restaurant week in Arizona (yes apparently all of arizona had restaurant week at the same time) and the selection was limited to the restaurant week menu ($40 for three courses) and a otherwise rather dismal selection of the original dinner menu. I had wanted to have the Washyugyu short rib, but they only offered this waguyu beef that wasn't offered as a part the prix fixe menu, and there was nothing on this menu to pair it with, so knowing that their portions are small, i had to go with the fixed price menu, which turned out to be quite good.  They start you out with a mixed plate of SNAP PEAS, SHASITO PEPPERS, HOUSE KIMCHI, and a GAZPACHO type SOUP. The kimchi was my favourite, than the soup. The rest were okay.  For my first course, I chose the SHIROMI CARPACCIO, which was a white sashimi fish that is served with hot flavoured oil poured on top in front of you and paird with house-made foccacia. The flavour of the oil includes \"ginger, yuzu kosho, sesame oil, garlic\" and their faccacia is fused with herb. Together, the combination really opens up your appetite. I dont like sashimi, but this I ate all.   For the second course, I was suggested the LOBSTER ROLL, since it's not often on their menu. To be honest, I was a tiny bit disappointed since I was promised that it was going to be phenomenal and I got just very good. The lobster roll had minimal mayonnaise (which is good IMO) but it also had more vegetables than lobster. What I did find amazing was that although there appeared to be a lot of celery in there, the flavour did not overcome the dish and you barely taste the celery, just the crunchy texture. I wasn't a fan of the lukewarm sweet bread in place of a real roll. It also comes with a tiny bowl of bisque, which is the sauce they seem to use in the roll as well. The bisque was mediocre, but the fresh chives really added flavour to the whole thing.   For the last course, dessert, I got the japanese pastry mix, which came with a BLACK SESAME BRULEE, ORANGE MOUSSE, and a CREAM PUFF. I generally don't like the black sesame flavour, but the brulee was so good I ate every last bite. The Orange mousse was served in an orange peel. At first bite it was a bit too tangy, but the more you ate, the better it taste. It also helped that there were pulp inside the mousse, which gave it amazing texture. I saved the cream pouf for last because it was my favourite. It was your average cream puff but carved in a way that looks like a picnic basket, and served with fresh strawberries , which really kicked the puff up a notch.   I loved the fact that this place can take a regular japanese dish and kick it up a notch by adding such simple things.   Service: My main server was okay. She wasn't all that nice, but was helpful in suggestions as she took my order. There were 3-4 people that served dishes, took my bill, etc., and they were all extremely friendly and made you feel really welcome. The host who ended up taking my bill was very chatty with me and thanked me for dropping by on my first day in Phoenix.   I really hope to come back again in the next few days.",

Doubly unfortunate, Chef Chris Bevington wasn't able to make the event due to an injury.  Terry ordered the tea smoked chicken omelet which comes with a side of cubed melon. She said the chicken was very flavorful; however, for $14 she thought the portions were a bit lean. I ordered the Japanese breakfast that came with choice of meat [ grilled mackerel, saikyo miso black cod or pork cutlet--I let Chef Nobuo decide, and he selected the mackerel which was awesome!], house-made tofu, spinach balls, miso soup and rice.

I'm not sure the quality of the regular food menu yet the bento box dinner entree during restaurant week was good, not great. The bento box was a seafood or meats selection that ranges from ahi slice tuna, grilled mackerel, pork wrapped bun to medallion beef filet. It was a nice assortment of choices yet not the best quality for a 30 year Japanese chef.  The waiter was friendly and attentive yet the food runner was the complete opposite. They failed to properly provide a detail description of items being served and ran off faster than a bull in Spain. I think proper training could be implemented in this area of service.  The decadent desserts offered is what brought my 3 star rating to 4 stars. The robust blended flavors of berries on top of a well prepared graham cracker crust was the desert of choice. A truly divine creation! The carmelized tofu topped with candied sweetened popcorn was unique and creative but not a favorite.",

    "text": "Not impressed.  My husband and I decided to try this place while we were out of town for a conference- we tried 3 dishes which seemed to be the most popular.  1. sashimi special- for tonight they were serving mackarel. Presentation was beautiful- the entire mackarel was displayed on the plate alongside the sashimi, and after you were done eating they take the bones to be deepfried to make chips. However, aesthetics is all this dish had, and it definitely lacked in flavor. I usually enjoy the taste of mackarel, but the manner in which the pieces were cut did not allow the flavors of the fish to come through- bland.   2. hamachi & grapefruit- one order comes with four spoon bites which were a nice blend sweetness from the grapefruit and citrus from the ponzu  3. uni with oyster- very disappointed with this. oyster was not of high quality and was topped with a baby piece of uni. $16 for 2 pieces is way overpriced.",

The entire lunch menu made life difficult to choose just one dish...but I had to go with the Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. They make it all in house...focaccia bread, aioli. Maybe the best sandwich I have ever encountered. The little helping of slaw on the side is perfect. A little spicy from the spicy daikon...leaves a zing on your tongue.  Jasmine tea was served in a Hario Glass Pot...and set the mood as rain hit the window. This tea also made me piss 20 times over the next 6 hours.  Well worth the wizz.

Their food is truly innovative and a True foodgasm.  90% of their dishes covers all those basic 5 senses (sweet, sour, bitter, umami, salty), making their dishes well balanced and an explosion of flavors in your mouth without thinking, let me add a pinch of this or that to make it better.  Here are my recommendations:   The presentations were just as good as the flavors!!!   Watermelon and goat cheese - so fresh and delightful, great starters  House cured salmon - amazing!! Left me wanting more  Grapefruit hamachi - again, wow...keep them coming  Sashimi plate - a spoon of each amazing and heavenly flavors!!! Love!!   Shiromi carpaccio- wowshers!  Yellowtail ceviche - love!!   Soft shell crab salad - tasty  Seabass and mushroom in parchment paper was good as well but I like all the other dishes significantly more   Overall- the flavors for their dishes are divine!!! Top notch in creativity, flavors and presentation.  5 stars all the way!!",

    "text": "This felt like a super-trendy L.A. restaurant with microscopic portions that was transplanted to Phoenix. While the ingredients, preparation and flavors are top notch, the super tiny portions at the high price point make this a \"won't come back\" for me. If an orange slice and a shot of diet soda is a big meal for you, this is the perfect place for you.  The restaurant is clear when you make a reservation that it is not your typical sushi restaurant. This is very high end, very deliberately \"lots of flavor in a tiny package\" Japanese cuisine. If that is what you are looking for, you are in for a treat, as Nobou does that very well. If you are looking for a filling meal with generous portions at reasonable prices, this is not the place for you.  We had a party of 6 for dinner. Service was okay but unenthusiastic and bordering on snobby (hence my reference to feeling like being at an L.A. restaurant). The salmon appetizer was 6 tiny, postage-stamp sized pieces of salmon with 2 roasted nuts on top drizzled with basil oil. Delicious but ridiculously small. Same with the vegetable plate - six teeny tiny piles of different vegetable preparations. Again delicious but the portion size seems ridiculous. Soft shell crab plate was more generous in portion size. Duck plate was a decent amount of duck for one person but sat on top of a few tablespoons worth of noodles - how expensive are noodles, could you be more generous with them?  Our table half-joked about going for drive through after leaving the restaurant. We shared a few appetizers and a few main dishes, plus one drink each and it came to $50/person. Not okay when you leave feeling hungry.  So if you are from L.A. or New York and want a \"scene\" dining experience with exotic preparation and tiny portions, this is the place for you. If not, look elsewhere.",

The food was so good, presented beautifully, and was like nothing I've had before Our meal was presented in Bento Box's. And I thought I was going to leave hungry. Not even close. I left very satisfied. The staff explained everything to us and were very patient and friendly. The restaurant is beautiful as well. Just all around a great place to go for a special vacation. The chef of Nobuo is one of the most acclaimed chefs in AZ. You should expect to pay a bit more than your average restaurant, so be prepared, but as I said, it is worth it. I will look for another reason to go, maybe next Restaurant Week. I highly recommend Nobuo At Teeter House.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened, but never had a chance. Knowing this, my husband surprised me with a reservation here for my birthday dinner. The food was as good as expected, and changed my mind about a few non favorite items. They have two different sections to the menu a cold menu and a hot menu. The cold menu has mostly crudo, veggies and raw items and the hot menu were heavier cooked items. We went with the following:  Cold Menu: Tako & Tomato: Delicious grilled octopus with fresh mozzarella & tomato, an unexpected combo that works  Shiromi Carpaccio:  Thinly sliced raw white fish with a hot sesame oil w/focaccia to sop up the sauce. This was also delicious and if you're looking for some more substance to your appetizer the focaccia was a great addition  Grapefruit & Yellowtail: My favorite appetizer, a fantastic mix of sweet and savory with sweet grapfruit and perfectly fresh yellowtail, a must try!  Hot Menu: Soft Shell Crab Salad: I was leery of ordering this, I'm not a fan of soft shell crab because any time I've eaten it I've found it to be very fishy. Apparently I've been eating it at the wrong places (chain sushi restaurants) because I loved the crab in this dish. The panko crusted crab was delicious and fresh tasting, not fishy at all. The fresh vegetables and herbs were a fantastic addition along with the peanuts and nuac cham fish sauce. I guess I need to be more selective of where I order my soft shell crab as it turns out I am a fan, I just haven't ever eaten the fresh stuff until now.  Warm Duck Salad: Duck has never been my top pick either, but the menu description sounded enticing and it turned out to be a great choice too! The duck was cooked perfectly and the grilled greens were equally as good.  Coconut Curry Lamb: Like the two other choices, lamb has never been my favorite either. I was really trusting tonight, and am glad that I reached out of my comfort zone because this dish was amazing! Like the other two dishes the lamb was cooked perfectly medium rare and had a light coconut curry flavor. I really liked how the curry flavor was underlining as to not overpower the lamb flavor. The mango fennel salad was a great side to this dish.  Dessert: Chocolate cake with white chocolate green tea ice cream - I wasn't expecting this dessert to really stand out, as I don't typically order dessert in Asian restaurants, but it was my birthday and it was given to us complimentary for the occasion. This dessert was as good as the rest of the meal, the cake was rich and the ice cream was delicious and had great flavor.   I will definitely return to Nobuo, it made me a fan of dishes that I typically don't care for, because the ingredients were top notch and the dishes were prepared perfectly. The service as amazing too, our waitress' recommendations were spot on. My only complaint was that I wasn't a huge fan of the cocktails, they weren't bad just not to my taste. So the next time I return I'll have some pre-drinks at Rose & Crown or Bar Bianco and then have my meal at Nobuo.",

I first heard about this place years ago, and after venturing downtown and showing up early once on a whim, and then the other time making a reservation on like a Wednesday a week in advance, I've never had an issue.   I actually wound up getting a science center membership? Just to eat here again. I know I know, seems silly, but I just love it. And I'm planning on going one more time to make my membership worthy!  I usually end up getting two orders of things, as they are decently small portion sizes, but quality over quantity is definitely the case here! It's a pretty romantic spot, I do usually get claustrophobic in downtown, but this place? Nope. Maybe it's the food.... The food is my version of Xanax. Till we meet again my lovely teeter house!",

This was the mistake.  I'm not a salmon fan, so I never would have ordered this.  It was fine. The balsamic was really nice.    2. Grapefruit and hamachi.  I had such high expectations.  It was fine, but the flavors didn't really knocked me out.    3. Tako and tomato.  Now we're talking! There's a strong hit of acid, followed by really wonderful textures, and it ends with a beautiful pow from the pink peppercorns.    4. Shiromi carpaccio.  Oh, yeah!  Where have you been all my life?  The fish is slightly cooked by hot oil at your table.  The sauce is divine.  You do have to order extra bread for an extra charge to clean your plate.  It's worth it.   5. Kabocha squash pot au crime with house made marshmallows.  So creamy and sweet.  I'm not a dessert person, but this was lovely.  I didn't use my fingers to clean off the pot, but I could have.   The drinks list is worth a mention.  Lots of variety.  I ordered a sake and a white wine.  The white was killer.  I didn't commit the name to memory.    If I had skipped the salmon and hamachi, this would have been 5 stars.",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted to love this place. I actually feel kinda bad giving 3 stars... but It's not quite 4 stars because of my combined experience and the value of my meal.  I'm not familiar with Phoenix area but I'm not foreigner to Japanese food or to upperscale restaurants (especially when a restaurant is $$$).  When I walked in I instantly fell in love w/ the decor! It was so romantic, cozy, and warm. A perfect place to unwind with your dinner or have a nice evening with your S.O.   However, since I am on business travel, I asked for a table for 1.   Ambiance I got seated at the bar instead. OK, that's fine, I can deal with that (probably my fault since I didn't do a reservation). For such a nice place, you'd expect a better bar area? It was very lit up and lots of prep stations behind the bar, not a very good scene to be looking at when you're at a $$$ restaurant. Nobuo was actually standing behind the bar doing his planning/prepping for the night. I was the only one in the bar and he did not greet or make eye contact with me for the first 15 mins I sat there. I felt a little alienated at once, but that's fine, I'm not new to high-ranked Japanese chef attitudes (he eased up a lot later on, but sometimes that first impression makes a big difference in making your guests feel welcomed).  I ordered the raved about hamachi grapefruit, foie gras, and tako age (octopus fritters).  Hamachi grapefruit $16, ($24 with truffle shavings) -Maybe Yelp over-hyped it for me, but  this wasn't that great. It was good, the hamachi was def high quality but I thought the ponzu had a tad too much soy sauce and that really overwhelmed/covered the beautiful, light taste of hamachi I was expecting. -I got the option to add fresh white truffles (from Italy!) shavings to my appetizer. They special catered to my request of adding truffles to half of my appetizer because I still wanted to taste the original intent of appetizer. Of course, they did push to accommodate the truffle to be added because it's more expensive. Nobuo gave me a lot of shavings but it wasn't the case with other people's orders. -Overall I didn't think adding the white truffle was worth the flavor/texture boost. It was actually very little boost for how much more it cost. I would opt out next time. -The size of the bite was a little too big for me... a tad awkward, but who am I to complain about having more food? IMO, it would probably be better served 2/3 of it's current size... maybe more spoons? With a smaller bite/chew, I feel like the flavors can mix better in your mouth.  Tako Age $8 -This comes with a yuzu aioli. This aioli got better and better as you ate it. The citrusy of the yuzu balanced well with the heaviness of the tako fritter. -I expected these fritters to be really crispy but it was not. The texture of the batter was actually a little cake-y (like microwaved corn dog? but not in a bad way!). The crunchiness came from the octopus which was super delightful! I wish there was a TINY bit more octopus for the texture but otherwise it was a pretty good ratio. -It's octopus and I think a fish paste (?) inside? Well it had a fish paste texture, but of course a fresh fish paste.  Foie Gras $28 -This was shockingly small for the price tag. I checked their online menu before going, I guess they upped the price and didn't update the online menu. The foie was maybe about 2-3oz size... -This was super good. The foie was AMAZING, but I think that speaks more to the quality of the foie rather than anything else. But again, I'm a HUGE foie fan so I'm already biased! I melted as the foie melted inside my mouth.  -The sear was spot-on. -Pairing was smart (also standard). There were marinated pears to clean your palate from the fattiness of the foie, but who wants to?!?! You want that flavor to linger as long as possible! -I even tried the sesame leaf with the foie. I wasn't sure if the intent was decoration or to eat, but I love sesame leaves! Reminds me so much of Japan. I think it's for decoration though... I probably seemed like a cheap, desperately hungry bastard eating that leaf! I swear I was just curious!!!  Overall, for $$$ I didn't think it was worth it for the ambiance I was provided (bar area), I mean I still paid the same as other diners! The service was very meh for a $$$ restaurant. It was good, but wasn't stellar for this price range. I actually had higher expectations of food flavor-combos as well. Food was still very good, but not I'm not WOW-ed.  My total bill came out to be $65 (w/o drinks, before tips).",

    "text": "We finally got around to visiting Nobuo and despite spending nearly $350 for two people, we're really glad we did.  The food here is terrific.  The menu is eclectic, ingredients are super fresh, presentation is creative but not overblown.  I cannot say enough about how the food flavors are clean and wonderful without an overabundance of seasoning.    Cold Plates: I would recommend anything made with Yellowtail tuna.  The Grapefruit YT is spectacular here as is the YT Ceviche.  YT is a bellwether for me on how good a Japanese restaurant is.  This is some of the best I've ever had.  It starts to melt on your tongue the second it lands there. I'd also recommend the Shiromi Carpaccio.  Wow!  The hot sesame oil poured by your server cooks the thinly sliced fish on the spot -- and then you soak it up with a crispy outside, moist inside focaccia bread that was so good, we asked for more.  Hot Plates: I'd recommend the Pork belly Wrapped in Banana Leaf.  It was outstanding.  Not too fatty, but just enough for flavor.  The banana leaf added a terrific rustic flavor that cannot be overstated.  Also the Coconut Curry Lamb was aromatic and delicious.  Four tender shanks of cooked medium-rare lamb are coated with a light curry that really accentuated the flavor of the meat.  Again, not over-seasoned here, so if you're thinking this is a heavy Thai or Indian sauce, it's not. Last but not least was the Foie Gras. If you love Foie Gras, this is as good as it gets.  Sweet, unctuous, seared perfectly.  Enough said.  Wine:  We chose a Gruner Veltliner made in Santa Ynez, CA and it was the perfect pairing with our food.  The wine list is ample and well curated.  Prices are a bit steep, but that's True for everything at Nobuo.  Service: Our server was super-knowledgable, friendly and probably the best up-seller of any server I've ever had.  Atmosphere: Loved the old Teeter House across the walk from Pizza Bianco.  Such as neat part of town. Small rooms make for cozy, intimate dining.",

But, is that what one goes to a restaurant for? Not so much. Lets talk food, prices and service.  Food & Prices = honestly, foods are a 5 on a 10 point scale. We had about 6 things. Each was \"fair\". The presentations were nice and they looked like they'd taste great. But each was just okay. For example, snap peas, they are good by nature,....right? Spruce all 14 of them up with a bit of peanut sauce and theoretically they're even better, and maybe they are a little bit.  Then, however, dump on a cup full of dried, store bought fish flakes and some cayenne pepper and what do you have? Something that started pretty good and got, well, strange and not appealing.  And for this you'll get to pay around $10-15.  Same with the raw/seared tuna. Sounds great, right? Now, take the 8 tiny pieces of fish, pour a cup of bland (but colorful) beet paste around it, place 4 micro-chunks of yellowish beet smaller than a sugar cube next to it and lay it appealingly on a plate for $14-$16 and viola, you have an unremarkable, mediocre 1/3 of an appetizer for the price of an entree anywhere else. And the end pieces were half cooked and fishy tasting.  We had 4 pieces of \"sushi\" for about $15. They looked really cool, and if that's important to you, you'll like this place. Each of the 4 pieces was its own little package and the taste was bland, boring.  Honestly the other items were so underwhelming that they aren't worth mentioning.  Service = this is odd. It seems the employees can't quite figure out what kind of \"trendy\" this place is.  Is it tree-hugger'ish, hemp skirts and crunchy trendy? Is it tattooed and pierced trendy? Is it red hair and dark eye makeup trendy?  It was some kind of strange conglomeration. What it WASN'T,....was \"friendly trendy\". Our dark haired, 30-something, drab personality waitress literally didn't smile once. She was there in body, but not in spirit or personality, for sure. This was clearly a job and there was no room for any enjoyment.   Overall, we spent $100 and 1/2 way through we literally discussed what we'd be ordering at In N Out Burger on the way home.  My recommendation: skip this place. There are some really cool places to eat \"downtown\" that have better food, more of it, way better tasting, better attitude and much more reasonably priced. This is, of course, unless you are one that loves to tell your friends that you ate at this cool, trendy little place in a really small old neat house and the food was soooo good, knowing in the back of your mind that it was mediocre at best and you wish you'd have eaten elsewhere.",

I was starving when we arrived and did not want to finish three of the dishes because that was all I could taste. Also, the duck we had received for an entree was incredibly dry and I only ate a couple pieces. We ended up spending over 115 dollars and had to go to a taco stand afterwards in order to get full.  With that being said, our waiter was incredibly nice and seemed sincerely interested. The cocktail he suggested was very interesting and was unlike anything I had ever tried. It had whiskey and egg whites, but that's all I remember specifically. The atmosphere and location is very cool, but I do not plan on returning.",

The restaurant took a reservation so we had a table waiting when we arrived.   There were five in our party so we had an opportunity to try many different dishes that were shared with the whole table. All of the dishes were absolutely amazing - fresh ingredients with flavors that blended and complimented each other. The waitresses helped us by giving recommendations and all her suggestions were spot on in terms of quantity for our party and types of dishes we would enjoy.   The prices were a little high but the quality of the food was equally high so felt that we definitely got the value for our money.   Would highly recommend for anyone who enjoys trendy high quality Japanese food.",

Cinder blocks and 2x4s as furniture are effective but are a sign of cheapness in a place that wasn't cheap.  That said, it was a welcome change to a few days of hotel catered buffets. Had the pizza type garbage plate style thingy with an obviously difficult name that I struggled through and almost instantly forgot.

    "text": "Having heard all the rave about this place and the very unique description of the restaurant on their website, I had to try it when visiting downtown Phoenix with a friend. We were lucky to walk in with two area left for a party of two because the place was fully reserved. I highly recommend making reservation if you are visiting during the weekend.   The atmosphere is very pleasant and peaceful. The decor is very unique, especially a little cabinet with all kinds of teapots and cups located next to the bar area. They also have a lounge area for a party of 2-4 looking for a more laid back gathering.   Their portion is definitely too small for the price they charge. It costs $6 for a small plate of shishito peppers. The peppers were very well grilled and drizzled with extremely tasty sauce but there were only about a dozen or so peppers. For equally tasty shishito peppers, you can get way more peppers for $7 at Roka Akor or RA Sushi.   The tuna tataki is served with sweet onion sauce that is extremely strong. Definitely not recommended if you do not like onion. Instead, I highly recommend their pork belly buns. It is very flavorful with sour taste from the pickled mustard green, juiciness from the pork belly, sweetness from the hoisin-like sauce, crunchiness from the cucumber, all of it wrapped in a fluffy bun. It reminds me a lot of Peking duck dish.   While I enjoyed most of the dishes and the atmosphere, I felt that their dishes are overpriced. I am unlikely to return unless I am around the area with a friend who loves Japanese food and feel like spending a lot.",

We got to sit in the lounge area which seemed very private, sexy and cozy - oh, except that's where all the wait staff walks in and out with every single order. Not so cozy after all.  We started out with the fried octopus. The sauce it came with was delicious, but the dish itself was way too breaded. I could barely taste the octopus. Next we had the crab sandwich. Pretty good, but not outstanding. Lastly, we had the duck salad. That was on point! The duck was perfectly cooked. Overall, not bad. But pretty pricey for the portions. I don't mind small portions as I don't necessarily like leaving feeing like a stuffed piglet, but still. Simply not up to par for the price. Skip this and go to Rose & Crown next door.",

There were some things that we had the week before, Pork Belly Buns ( which seem to be very popular )  good, but very filling.  The restaurant is a tapas Japanese style and perfect for two to share.  There are no really main dishes, I recommend just ordering everything you want and they will just bring it out as it is ready.  Some seasonal items that we had that I highly recommend if you are in there in the next couple weeks Soft Shell Crab and Stuffed Squash Blossoms.  I was totally bummed that the Black Cod was already gone off the menu as it was SOOOO good.  We had the House Cured Salmon, Warm Duck Salad and Almond Fritters.  Very strong selection of wine and Sake of course :)  The place is absolutely adorable, the Teeter House is name after the woman who had lived there.  It is a historic home that has been beautifully redone.  Their servers on very attentive and done act overwhelmed.  However, you will always see the owner/chef there which always makes a huge difference in how a restaurant is ran.  I could go on and on about the food, I just recommend you go.  If you get a chance sit at the bar, you will be able to meet and see Nobuo at work.  He is a very friendly chef and you will be very impressed by him.  This is a great fresh take for the Valley and I recommend hoping out of that Pizza line and coming over here, it will blow your socks off and not break the bank  PARKING:  Note about parking, it is tight, you need to park in the garage behind the science center but hope it is not an event night or it is $12, there are meters around the place but hard to find one",

We had the okra, squash blossom, house-cured salmon, tuna tataki, oysters, sea bass and the chocolate tofu mousse with green tea ice cream.  Everything was fresh, delicious, and nicely presented.  My favorite was the big-eye tuna tataki. The roasted beet puree was a perfect accompaniment to the tuna.  My hubby most favored the oysters.    My only real criticism of this place was the exceptionally slow service.  They bring out one item at a time and there was a substantial wait between each dish.  If you are at all hungry, or if you have plans afterward, the wait time will certainly annoy you.  I would suggest that Nobuo change this policy and bring out a few items together.  Or time it such that the next item is ready to go after you finish the first.  I noticed other tables getting bothered by the long wait time as well.    Another suggestion I would make is for the restaurant to spend a little more time with the decor.  If they updated their look a bit, they would move from being a great restaurant to a superior restaurant.  We sat in the part of the restaurant with the blue walls, and it was a bit drab.  But do go to Nobuo for the cuisine, you won't regret it!",

My husband brought me there for my birthday, so it was just the two of us.  We wish we had come with more people so we  could have tried even more dishes.  The only thing that was disappointing was that my husband indicated when he made the reservation, but there was no acknowledgement of that.  Not only weren't we offered a complimentary dessert, but we were never even asked if we'd like to see dessert menu. Skip the dessert though, what we did have was not very memorable.  Normally, I would dock them a star for these missteps, but the food was that good!  Want to try lunch there too since the menus are totally different.",

The Asian Tapa little bistro is also a great sale point.   I ordered the regular soft shell crab salad and the seasonal special fried squash blossom. They were decent, but not what I paid for decent. My friend had some short rib dish, which was suppose to have a great flavor with combination of  spiced daikon, egg sauce, and grilled bok choy as sauce. Well... the meat was nice for that dish... but everything failed.  Will still like to try it sometime and see what other unique items i could discover. But probably not anytime soon.",

We had lunch this time during the Arizona Matsuri and my tonkatsu sandwich was a joyous surprise - tender pork cutlet with traditional tonkatsu sauce and a hint of hot mustard on toasted bread. The soft shell crab sandwich lacked spark but it was fresh and tasty nonetheless. Japanese fries were well cooked and salted just right. Looking forward to returning for dinner.",

    "text": "First of all, there is NO WAY this is a $$ restaurant. It's at LEAST a $$$ restaurant. Easily a $$$$ restaurant if you're a big eater. That's pretty much the only reason I'm giving it four instead of five stars. It's some pretty grievous False advertising. Change the business info to $$$$ and I'll give it five stars.  Each regular dish is $8-14 (the ever-changing featured dishes average about $20+ each), but for two people they recommend that you order FOUR to SIX dishes. We easily ordered six, which ended up being over $80... without dessert and no alcohol. We could have gone eight dishes. The portion size is like eating Japanese dim sum (but very fancy and MUCH more expensive). As with dim sum, the optimal party size is four so that you can try more dishes.  Second of all, you'll probably think that it's worth the expense! I thought so, anyways. The food was superb. It was artful. It was subtle. It was balanced. It was nuanced. It was sublime! Hopefully, you know three other people willing to drop $50+ each on an exquisite meal.  Both of our two appetizers were heavenly: the squash blossoms and sugar snap peas. Honestly, they were perfection. I was really hoping to try the Teeter Tots, but they had been out for a week. Next time I call to make a reservation I'll ask them if they've got the Teeter Tots ; ).  Our entrees were the Shiromi Ceviche, Grapefruit & Hamachi (my dining companion isn't a fan of grapefruit, but I was more than happy to down the other three), Pork Belly Buns (she loved them; I wasn't a fan of the crunchy cucumber... I'll stick with char siu bao, but they were very, very good), and the marinated & fried soft shell shrimp. The soft shell shrimp was fabulous, but I thought that I had ordered the soft shell crab (which is my favorite food) so I was a little disappointed. Its excellence somewhat made up for it.  The setting felt intimate even though there was another table just a few feet from us. And, I might be crazy, but I honestly don't remember ever seeing the \"Featured dishes\" menu. It's all good. It was our first time, so we would have been overwhelmed by having too many choices otherwise. As it was, we heavily relied on our server who was very helpful!",

Missed the 1st incarnation of this as I was out of town but happily made the 2nd.  Love the fact that it ran from sundown to midnight.  Big fan of anything that goes late. Actually went quite a bit past midnight.  Went with several friends which enabled us to try a good portion of the menu:  Started with McClendon's Select shishito peppers roasted in olive oil & soy sauce. Super yummy. About 1 in 5 were spicy. Perfect with beer.  Next up was watermelon & goat cheese with McClendon's Select sun-gold tomato, olive oil & mint. Another great dish. Light & refreshing. Great for the AZ night.   A universal favorite is always the soft shell crab sandwich with green papaya slaw. These are always killer. Got hooked on these at Sea Saw a long time ago and they are one thing I can never get enough of.  Had the pork belly with steamed buns & pickled mustard greens. This was a killer sandwich. Loved it.   Also had the marinated short rib with steamed buns. Also good but would probably do 2 pork belly next time.   Anddid my first ever Okonomiyaki - Japanese pancake with pork, octopus, squid topped with pickled ginger, shaved bonito, dried shrimp, Japanese mayo & tonkatsu sauce. I'd been wanting to try this for a long time. It was super yummy. Quite rich too. I batted cleanup for a couple people with these.  I also did one of the Japanese sodas which are always fun. They're the one in the cool shaped bottle with the marble used as a seal that you have to break through. Kind of like an interesting candy flavored Sprite, less sweet though. Yummy.  And then I finished up with the Kakigori (Japanese shaved ice). I went with strawberry, sweetened condensed milk and red bean. Just flat out awesome.  Ready for Nobuo's next gig!",

Almost every dish was well executed and delicious and interesting. Every but the tako balls which were a special of the day... They have an extensive shochu and sake list.  It was great that the chef himself gave the table a mini shochu tour of the different refined and aged shochus. Fun and delicious!",

I had a bite and had to asked her to take it back.  Lychee Red Iced tea- something different to try :)   Overall, i would go back and try other foods and drinks on the menu.",

    "text": "Nobu offers Japanese fusion cuisine in an elegant modern but yet traditional Japanese setting.  There were numerous courses of beautifully prepared and imaginatively presented food on small plates the standard Japanese Isakaya (tapas).  My favorites were teeter tots which were absolutely incredible.  The spicy miso sauce was very addictive, and fried tofu with green onions on top is excellent.   The soft shell crab sandwich was good, but I think I like it more in a sushi roll.  As for dessert, after seeing everyone's order, I just couldn't resist not to order one for myself.  I have ordered the Orange-almond fritters, the smell of the orange in the warm fritters are splendid, and tasted even better.  The exotic flavor of the jasmine tea ice cream was very refreshing; just wish they have another scoop on it.   I took the pork belly buns home, and tried the next day. The braised pork belly buns with preserved mustard cabbage vegetable remained me of a Chinese-style dish that my dad loves.  Actually, I preferred something different than the fatty pork belly in the bun.  I just don't like the texture of the fatty part of the meat.    Overall, I had a superb UYE dinner at Nobu.  I am glad that they participated in Yelp Eats Week.   I hope they will be back for next Yelp Eats Week.  Thanks so much for organizing this, Lindsey!",

We have dined there more than a dozen times and had always been pleased with the services and the quality of their food.  Except for last night!!  We couldn't quite figure out what it was, but uni was almost \"dried up\" and hamachi was less than stellar.  Was someone else other than Mr. Nobu cooking last night?  Our server was not very helpful when we asked about the specials either.  Half way through our dinner, we got another server, and he was very helpful and we did very much enjoy the oxtail dish.  Since we do love Nobuo, we will give it one more try, and if it turns out to be a strike again, we will just stick with Yasu Bistro.",

    "text": "I had a birthday dinner with my twin at Nobuo while I was in Phoenix for business.  Chef Futaka exceeded my expectations in every way.  He personally came and explained the tasting menu to us.  It was the most personal eating experience that I had.  He discussed where all the food was sourced from to our delight.  I couldn't believe the chicken was fed parmesan cheese and yogurt!  No wonder it was so tender.  I felt like I was on Top Chef seeing the amazing food and to be able to ask the Chef questions about it.  At one point, he even demonstrated the difference between fresh and store bought bonito flakes for us.  This was one component of a dish that I was curious about.  This is not a typical Japanese restaurant where sushi was served.  It's surprising that it's in Phoenix and would've fit right in the NYC food scene.  The dishes was inventive, thoughtful and really a joy to see and taste.   The best part of the night was when Chef Futaka surprised us with a personal chocolate cake made by his pastry chef for our birthday.  Wow!  Most restaurants just put a candle on a regular menu desert but the restaurant actually made a cake for us as a surprise.  I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasion or just a good night out.",

Nobuo might endear itself more to western clientele if they offered something actually filling, like a big, inappropriate bowl of mashed potatoes (or starchy Japanese equivalent), to tide diners over between delectable flights of ephemeral fancy.    The highlights really are wonderful. Try the sublime grapefruit/hamachi, steamed buns, soft shell crab sandwich and deep fried shrimp w/ papaya slaw. Courses are slowly paced, fostering conversation and savory anticipation. Servers instruct diners to scarf morsels like \"shots\", and this really does feel more like a leisurely evening of wine tasting than a traditional sit down dinner.   Dinner for five, sans drinks, was $200, and this skinny multiculturalist immediately rushed home to fix myself a sandwich. And some dessert.  I can only imagine the consternation of fat xenophobes at Nobuo.  If you're comfortable surrendering cash along with the gauche expectation of feeling full after a meal,  dinner here can be a lovely treat.  Otherwise, I might suggest sampling portions at lunch first to assess the situation.",
