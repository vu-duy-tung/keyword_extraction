But after expressly warning our waitress about one of our party's extreme cilantro allergy -- she will go into anaphylaxis -- the kitchen turned out an appetizer with just that on it. Inattentive, slow service, and the bill came back wrong, too. In their favor, the manager gave us coupons off for a future visit, which helped smooth things over, and the food was quite tasty when it finally arrived. Worth trying again on a better night.",

    "text": "As a former New Yorker, there are 2 things I'm always looking for, good pizza and good chinese food. My favorite chinese dish has always been shrimp with lobster sauce. The New York in me loves a white egg sauce as opposed  to a black bean sauce. Until today, I had not found any that lived up to my standards and my memories. My life in Arizona is now complete. Their lobster sauce was excellent, excellent, excellent!  My companion had a Tai food dish and was moaning in pleasure while eating. To complete the experience, since we were celebrating my birthday, our server brought us a dessert of coated, fried bananas, with a scrumptious sauce and coconut ice cream. This was the best birthday ever! Did I mention that our server was fantastic in every way?",

    "text": "My girlfriend liked this place more than I did. It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort.   The service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of \"everything is good, just order something so I can go home\". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it.   It wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.",

Light and healthy, and delicious. For our main course, I ordered the green curry with chicken and my husband ordered the red curry with chicken. Both were phenomenal and both were huge. I can't decide which one I like better. So so yummy. And we have lunch tomorrow, too, so many leftovers. Yum yum yum. Anytime I am in the area I will eat here. You should do the same.

The beef that they put in the dish (instead of pork) was practically inedible and they must use the lousy beef for these kinds of dishes. I can't picture a real beef dish with this slop involved. The noodles were also wet and very bad once you started digging through and they were cut oddly as well. The rice was a failure as well, more mushy junk that did not get tasted before heading out of the kitchen. Egg rolls are four to an order and they say crispy on the menu, but will arrive mushy and looking crispy, but no crunch at all. Also, this place has different prices on the website compared to the menu. 8 bucks for those eggrolls now. Extra star because staff made me laugh when I picked up food, but bad meal to start the year.",

    "text": "My wife and I thought we would try Totties based on a number of favorable reviews. Since moving to Scottsdale from San Diego, this is our first try at a local Thai restaurant. The place was tastefully decorated and very clean. The wait staff were some of the nicer people I have encountered in a restaurant. We arrived during happy hour so we were able to enjoy some nice and strong cocktails for five bucks a pop.   We both skipped appetizers and dived right into the main courses. I ordered the Kang Keo Wan with mussels- a spicy green curry dish. I have been skimped on seafood at other places yet my dish contained 10 LARGE and fresh mussels. A very good dish I must say. My wife ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp. Her's was tasty, spicy, and the noodles were not over cooked. When we first try a Thai restaurant we go for the curries and Pad Thai dishes. If they can make those to our taste, then we usually return to try other things...we will be back! Additionally, their fried banana with ice cream was the bomb!  If I had any complaints here they would be that the Thai tea wasn't the best I have had.  Op/Ed-        I get quite tired of people whining in every Thai Restaurant review regarding the lack of \"authentic\" or \"traditional\" fare, throwing these terms about as if they were in downtown Bangkok or something. I accept the fact that I live in the southwest. All I expect is great tasting food at reasonable prices. Totties 2 was very good at accommodating these simple requests.",

We felt seated very comfortably and could chat away without the background music or other tables being too loud.  SERVICE - Friendly and prompt.  FOOD - Both the noodle dishes just didn't feel quite right.. but that's probably why it's Asian-fusion. + Pho (beef and meatballs) - This was approx $8, and it was a good size, with generous amounts of beansprouts. However, this is not your traditional Pho broth - you're better off going to a legit Viet place for pho. The beef was also the thick slices of beef, which I'm not used to. Pho usually comes with the thinly sliced beef. Not a fan of this here.  + Spicy seafood noodle soup - Approx $12. The waitress asked me the level of spiciness I preferred. I told them mild, but this noodle soup was far from mild. It wasn't even spicy at all, you can probably increase your level of spiciness if you're more tolerant.  This is a  little more on the expensive side for noodle soups... which they try to make up for it by offering more tilapia fish fillets in the noodles.  It also comes with shrimp which was not very flavourful. I don't think I'll get this again next time either...  + Thai Iced tea - $3. This was the only item on the menu that I thought was authentic. For those who have not ordered Thai iced tea before - it's on the sweet side fyi!    I probably wouldn't be coming back if I'm in this area..",

Lychee ice cream is a definite miss. Maybe try the other flavors!  Thanida, the waitress, middle aged with crazy and curly ponytail WAS VERY UNATTENTIVE AND IGNORANT. She was not helpful and we had to ask the other waitresses for help. She never came to ask how our food was and was very slow with everything else. The young male waiters were VERY NICE AND HELPFUL.   The only thing THANIDA was fast with was the check. She kept coming back to check if we paid.  Go and eat but try to avoid THANIDA!!!!

They gave us huge portions and the waitress was very nice. I ordered softshell crabs with curry. They asked how hot I wanted on a scale of 1 to 7. I ordered a six and it was pretty hot. I'm glad I didn't order the seven. One person ordered a 4.5 and it was too hot for him so he had to order something else. Everyone else enjoyed the meal very much.

No oil, no sugar, no starch but ALL flavor!   Along side she brought me a dish of spicy Tottie sauce which is made from vinegar, chile and garlic.. again sugar free but still packed with complexity flavors and major heat!   Tottie is just an amazing chef, owner and person. Even this morning I'm still reeling about the experience I had at Totties last night, I felt just like family.",

    "text": "I came here a few days ago for a baby shower type Luncheon. Not really a True baby  shower. But, a lovely girl we know is having a baby in just a few weeks. So one of the girls organized a Luncheon for her. I had never been here to dine. I was very impressed.  It is located on the West side of Scottsdale Road in a Shopping Center type place. It is wonderfully decorated. Lots of gorgeous Art Work. They had set up a nice long table for us,I think there was about 12 ladies. The owner was there to greet us! She was so friendly and nice. The girls that were serving us were also ,just so nice and gave us all great service. Even though we all had separate checks which can be tough, but they handled it all perfectly.  Tottie herself made us some wonderful appetizers.  Some egg rolls that you wrapped in some beautiful dark lettuce and cilantro. So fresh and delicious.  Our food when it came also ,was hot and fresh. I got the Kung Pao Shrimp. Fantastic! You can choose the heat of the meal you get. I sampled some Curry that one of the other girls got. Same thing, it was so good.  Everything that everyone got was hot ,fresh and very tasty. We even all got a salad with our lunch. A really good salad as well.Dark lettuce, carrots sliced thin. It was a lot of food for a really great price. I am really looking forward to coming back here to dine another day. With the owner being so involved with the place,it just really shines outstanding. She works with her employees, so they are not stressed and the service was impressive. So check them out for lunch, you even get a choice of rice you would like. Or check them out for Dinner. It smells wonderful inside as well , with everything cooking.  Lots of parking in the lot. It is a huge parking lot. The restrooms are very clean and well stocked.",

HUGE bowl of veggie broth with noodles and chinese vegetables (hold the egg).  I darn near ate the whole cauldron!! hah  This last visit, I ordered the Panang, vegetarian.  Again, a great big vat of curry with coconut milk and veggies presented to me.  I asked for a little heat, and the waitress suggested a medium-low spice level, which turned out perfect.  Enough to get my taste buds awakened and keep me coming back for more mouthfuls!  My only *complaint* is that I asked for brown rice instead of white, and got hit with a $2 charge on the check.  I feel like if you're going to up-charge, you should at least inform the customer at the time of the request.  My dinner mate ordered a salmon dish that came with steamed veggies.  The salmon had a dark sauce on it, sprinkled with sesame ... The sauce was tasty, but the fish was a bit overdone and dry.  All in all, I'm sure I will be back.  Its conveniently located, clean, prompt service and food delivery, and I've not had to wait for a table. The prices on the menu can feel high, but you are getting a really fair amount of food for your buck.",

    "text": "I never write reviews. I'm furiously writing this one. Terrible customer service, terrible experience. Unfortunately I chose this place and convinced my husband to go and we had our three year old with us. We had 6:15 reservations. It was not busy. We ordered pretty quickly appetizers, soup and our entrees. About 20 minutes later my soup came (which I was sharing with my toddler so that was good) and that's all that came out. No appetizer, no soup for my husband. My toddler and I were eating sizzling rice soup which was okay at best. Finally the satay came out which was typical and good. It didn't take us long to observe the other patrons who were clearly waiting LONG periods of time for their food. The couple next to us almost left because it took 20 minutes just to get their beer. Well, my husbands soup still didn't come, an hour and 5 minutes later. My toddler and I were done eating. I cancelled my entree because I was so mad I wasn't hungry anymore. My toddler was done too. Finally my husbands soup came and we were done eating. The excuse our waitress told us was they were slammed with to go orders. Not acceptable. Restaurant patrons should come first. Well, my husband didn't even like his soup. It was Tom Kha spicy and tasted like Progresso tomato basil soup with chicken and mushroom. He sent it back. I complained to the waitress and the owner/manager? was there and they never said a word. No comped food. No one came by to tell us sorry for the insanely long wait. Nothing. We paid $60 for mediocre sizzling rice soup, chicken satay and fried rice which my husband took home be a we packed up and ready to go when that came. He was so mad he didn't even eat it when we got home. I was still hungry so I had some peanut butter. Don't waste your tome or money. The food is not good enough and the service is embarrassingly atrocious. And no one cared. That's the sad part.",

After discussing various dishes that I hadn't tried, the server suggested the Pad Thai.  It didn't disappoint me at all, and that's saying a lot since I'm particular about the flavoring of this sauce.  It was more than I could eat, I wish I could've taken it with me, but I was going to an event afterwards.

    "text": "Driving south from the Grand Canyon on a Sunday morning, we were late for lunchtime and hungry.  Tucked away in a small strip mall was this location of Tottie's, and what a \"find\" it was.  The decor at Tottie's is pleasantly understated and quite attractive.  Table placement and noise levels don't detract from the dining experience.  With an emphasis upon the cuisines of Thailand and Vietnam, the menu is geographically varied and large.  Yet, contrary to the current trend of Pan-Asian bistro restaurants, portion sizes are ample.  The food is satisfying, generally authentic and aesthetically plated.  As a guide, the kitchen uses an Asian standard of spiciness; \"moderate\" heat will pack a punch, albeit one which we found to be agreeable.  Lunch began with a shared appetizer of Vietnamese-styled rice paper summer rolls.  In comparison to others that I've eaten, these were uncommonly thick, and a bit difficult to eat out-of-hand.  Shrimp, shredded pork and mint were apparent, but an overenthusiastic use of vegetables muted their flavors.  The accompanying peanut sauce was successful in balancing the flavors, but was a bit under-seasoned in its own right.  An entree of red Panang beef curry was True-to-form in its Thai seasoning.  Accents of lemongrass and galangal, two aromatics often omitted from corner-cutting preparations, were apparent.  If a bit heavy in its liquid portion, the dish was otherwise spot-on.  The salmon filet in a basil and ginger sauce was both generous and quite tasty.  Very well balanced in its seasoning, yet not overpowering the taste of the fresh fish, this dish was an unconditioned success.  Shrimp Pad Thai rounded out our shared lunch entrees.  Ample in portion, a vermicelli noodle was used.  Pad Thai is best judged by how effectively the kitchen balances the key flavors of sweet, spicy, salty and sour, and lesser substitutions for tamarind sourness is usually where the preparation suffers.  In this case, however, slight demerits go to an inadequate representation of the sweet component-- perhaps the easiest area to master.  Although a bit unbalanced, the shrimp Pad Thai was still very good.  Our server, Rain, was enthusiastic, pleasant and prompt.  Before adding a generous tip for her services the tab for this enjoyable lunchtime feast for 4 totaled under $55; an excellent value for the dining experience received.",

    "text": "An offbeat bistro just north of Downtown Scottsdale that knows the key to good Asian fusion: mix the menu, not the dishes.  Tottie's offers large portions of hearty, and authentic, Asian cuisine that ranges from Chinese to Vietnamese to Thai to the owner's native Laotion.  We began the meal with an order of Vietnamese summer rolls, packed with shrimp, greens, mint, and a roasted pork that brought to mind char siu. The peanut dipping sauce added a pleasant touch. This was followed by a silky Panang curry, an on-point pad thai, and a ginger-basil salmon. There were no weak links, even if the Panang curry was a little muted and the pad thai noodles on the thinner side.  For the size of the dishes and quality of preparation, the meal was a good choice for a late lunch.",

My wife and I love Thai food but I try to limit the frequency to avoid over eating. Michael, our server, was incredible and made us feel like guests of honor. The decor is unlike any other Asian place - there was attention to detail and very clean.  The Tottie rolls are a must get and quite filling. We also got the string beans, well cooked I must say, the Panang curry, and the Pad Pra Kow beef. All of is was really good.  I highly recommend this place and for those who are sensitive to sodium, stay away from the curry dishes.",

So far I've had their Chicken Chow Mein and Chicken with Broccoli and both were fantastic. It can be hard to find good Asian food in Scottsdale but this definitely has to be one of the better choices. It's also nice to be able to pick different Asian cuisines as well, especially if you were to go with a group of people. The fried rice that it comes with is tasty and the salad for takeout is great as well. Just keep in mind that the wait for take-out can be a while so I would just call ahead and give yourself enough time.",

I like that they have menus outside, so that you can decide if you want to come in before \"committing\".  I was still in my medical scrubs, so I appreciated how there was \"no funny business\" about having to be shi-shi in such a gorgeous restaurant.  I truly enjoyed the decor.   I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Tottie who was so personable.  We chatted for a while.  The bartender was pleasant, accommodating and not bad on the eyes either :P  I ordered the Orient Express for only $5.  It was so good!  I love that the drink menu is categorized from dry to sweet.  For my meal, I ordered the Chiang Mai noodles without chicken.  It was good, but soupier than I expected.  It got thicker as it cooled down.  It had a nice flavor, but then again I love curry.  I did not expect it to be so much food!  I had leftovers for days!  Good food, gorgeous environment.  I definitely had a better experience here then at the location in South Scottsdale.  I could really see myself coming here for a birthday dinner.",

With overcooked shrimp. Overcooked, unchewable veggies. And a sauce so sweet and syrupy it could rot your teeth before you made it out the door. Even the rice was overcooked, and don't get me started on the bland, bland, bland egg roll and salad. My friend said much the same of her \"crispy\" noodles with basil, said noodles totally drowning in (again inappropriate) sweet sauce. Both dishes looked so ugly on the plate (like heaps of pre-chewed food) that after fishing out the shrimp, I just covered my plate with my napkin and ignored it. I promised my friend some real crispy noodles at Green Tea Bistro next time we go out and that's the end of my story. Wish I hadn't had to write it that way.",

The meat was severely lacking for $12; I only got 5 pieces of sorry-looking beef. The noodles came packaged separately, which is common for take-out pho, but these noodles were uncommonly stuck together, even after they soaked in the broth for 10 minutes. So, I ended up eating chunks of rice noodles. And finally, the restaurant gave lemon instead of lime for extra flavoring,  which I thought was strange and unappealing. Overall, the meal was not worth my money.",

Native to Laos, (nearly all) her recipes have been passed down throughout her family. The food and service are always wonderful. Tottie really has an eye for style. She is always dressed to the nines and the interiors of both her restaurants are stunning. The ambience is soothing, making it the perfect place to unwind (especially on the patio). I prefer this location, but both are stocked with sushi/full bars. This location boasts Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Japanese. The menus at T1 & T2 differ, as some dishes are offered at one location but not the other. A couple favorites of mine include the panang, shrimp puffs, Tottie rolls, Tom Kha Gai soup, wonton soup, mixed veggies, dragonfly noodles, Schezwan noodles, shu mai....can you tell it's my favorite? You can't go wrong here.   PS Amazing lunch specials + munchies menu",

Someone in the group got on the phone and called ahead to Tottie's to make sure food was waiting for us when we arrived.  We arrived, and there's already soup on the table and a couple orders of spring rolls. I try to express how thankful I am for their accommodating us, and to my astonishment there's already a spring roll in my mouth. When I try again I can't get the words past my soup spoon.  Not 5 minutes after sitting down the main dishes arrive, each one piping hot, some spicy hot. What did we order? I wish I knew. There were noodles. There were vegetables. Each dish had a very unique flavor that kept me shoveling it in and regretting I wasn't taking more time to taste it. Once I started to fill I savored the flavors a little more and was able to confirm that yes, this really is good food.  The food coupled with the splashy, colorful, retina workout of an ambiance made my trip to Tottie's memorable, and yet at the same time, as I sit here weeks later, it sort of seems like a dream. A tasty, nourishing, delightful dream.",

We ordered Tottie's Fried Rice which is a combination of shrimp, chicken and beef as well as the Crispy Chicken with Thai Basil both very tasty.   The standout of the meal was definitely the Soft Shell Crab Fresh Spring Rolls which were the most delicious rice paper rolls I have had in a long time!

This turns out to be the last beer I will be having for a very long time as I just found out I am pregnant.....glad I went out with a tasty beer! lol  The dessert menu looked amazing but we were so full from our meals it was actually impossible.

I ordered it on the low side of the spice range but even still it had little flavor. They only gave me one packet of soy - I could have used 5 or 6 more to add flavor. I've never had this with bok choy in it before - I realize this is a \"fusion\" restaurant so maybe it was the point that it tasted more Chinese than Thai. In any case, was just okay.",

    "text": "Tottie's 2 was one of the first restaurants my wife and I fell in love with when we first moved to Arizona. We ate there pretty regularly and ordered take out from there many times. However, something really changed this last time we went. After reading some reviews here, I realized that the business was sold to someone else - and I can tell.  I know most people who read reviews care more about the quality of food, so I'll start with that. The chicken in all of the foods have always been very dry (even with old owners), so my recommendation is to not get anything with chicken. I don't know why, but everything with chicken (we've tried a lot of dishes) is always dryer than it should be. Last night, I got the pineapple fried rice. I don't know what it is, but they may have also changed to using defrosted pineapple instead of fresh ones. There is absolutely no taste in the pineapple, and they are just there to add some texture instead of also boosting the taste. Very disappointed in the change there.  The thing that gave me the motivation to write this review though, is their service. We used to love dining in because the service was quick and friendly. Last night, we were seated in a non-peak time (it was about 25% full at that point) and it took about 10 minutes for a waitress to come over and ask if we've been helped. This is fine, maybe someone just forgot about our table and we made our orders, thinking nothing of it (though we were very hungry!) After we ordered (10 minutes after we arrived), another table of three was seated a couple of booths away from us. This table ordered about 5 minutes later, and yet they got their food a full 10 minutes before we did. By this point, I thought maybe they left out our orders since it's been close to 20 minutes before we got our food. But we did finally get it after a long time. Keep in mind that the restaurant at this point still wasn't very busy, though somehow our order was made after a couple of new tables that came (perhaps they switched up the order?).  After we finished eating and needed a couple of boxes and the check, the waitress took our food away and set it in their dirty dishes area and then went to pour wine, bring food out for other tables, put dirty dishes away, bring more food out, carry more dishes away, until I finally asked about our food. She brought the check, and also the boxed foods, but the entire process took another ten minutes.  The main concern here is that the restaurant wasn't busy. It was at best half-filled, and there were multiple waitresses. The efficiency with which they did things was horrendous, and it's really sad that what used to be our favorite Asian-fusion spot now turned into a horrendous memory. I really hope they change their ways and learn that they can provide a better customer experience by just being more aware.",

We started off with the chicken dumplings. The dumplings were fried and served with a soy sauce based sauce to dip them in. These were good, but nothing special. The best thing that we ate was the Thai basil chicken. Fried pieces of tender chicken smothered in a sweet and savory sauce served with a bowl of white rice. This dish was $14 dollars and you can definitely share this which is nice. Service was just okay. Water kinda had a funky taste to it. I would definitely return for that fried chicken dish though.",

Tonight we ordered our usual pad kee mao and a chicken dish . Both dishes came in styrofoam containers lined with foil and the dishes were sitting in oil . The dishes resembled soup , had zero flavor . These dishes are so good that we recommend to totties to everyone .

You can't even tell you're eating chicken. Just dry clusters of batter. Don't get me wrong, I love my orange chicken extra crispy. This wasn't crispy. Dry and hard. Pas Thai was okay. Not as good as you can get at pretty much any Thai place, but it wasn't off putting like the orange chicken. The only thing that wasn't horrible was the fact that they had pretty big portions. If you want large portions of bad food, come to Totties.",

One of the best Asian fusion cuisines in town by far.  Tottie has been featured in local magazines as one of the top chefs around that valley.  That really says something and needless to say Tottie's Asian Fusion doesn't disappoint.  I suggest family style since the dishes here are large.  I'm a big fan of the Tom Yum soup, Pad See Ew, and Chiang Mai Noodles.  The level of spice is up to you.  I can hang with the best however, I'll have to pass on the Thai spice haha!  I like to be able to taste my food aside from the spiciness.  Overall, the food is excellent, but also the decors are amazing.  Local artist Gary Hostellero doesn't hold back as he displays some of his finest works around the restaurant.  Live music during the weekends and a great atmosphere makes Tottie's a place for great dining and great chill out spot. - Enjoy!",

I was not too impressed with the chicken satay but that only means it wasn't what I'm used to. It seemed to be semi deep fried? Still tasty, even for delivery. The fresh spring rolls are to die for!!!  That is, if you're picky like me. I'm new to Scottsdale and in my native town (Minneapolis) fresh rolls are commonly filled with rice noodles, bbq pork, shrimp and cilantro or mint. These were beyond expectations. No lettuce fillers, a nice thin wrapper, amazing peanut sauce (also not my normal standard) and the pork filling... WOW! It was to die for. In addition we ordered the Pad Thai (Thai spicy) and it was just that! None of this spicy means mild stuff here. Awesome. And huge! But the star of the show was the Panang Curry Chicken. Holy food orgasm. I love curry and this was a mild version WITH spice but extremely addicting. To end the awesome (again, I must reiterate DELIVERY) we had the mango sticky rice. Another winner. Especially to end a good spiced meal. I wish I had ordered more after all the leftovers we had. I will be back to try more and I am a food freak. Try it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",

    "text": "We love Thai food and after reading the article in the January issue of Phoenix magazine elected to give Tottie's a try.  We arrived on a Friday evening to a partially full restaurant.  Found the decor and feel of the restaurant to be pleasant enough - the hostess was also very cordial, but I'm afraid this is the extent of the compliments we can pay this establishment.  Service was extremely slow - starting with a long wait of even having a server approach our table.  Everyone seem to be scurrying around - including our view of Tottie and her staff behind the front line; but the overall service was not expedited to showcase a well run operation.  Our shrimp puff appetizer arrived - and to our surprise and dismay, would guess that the pastry portion was a Pillsbury product, rolled out thin and fried.    After another long wait our entrees finally arrived, and again, while the portions were generous, the anticipated flavor and quality of each of our dishes just wasn't there!  (Shrimp tasted fishy ... my chicken didn't seem to be fresh).  Sorry to say - we will not be back and instead will return to our other 'tried and True' Asian restaurants, where we are assured both good service and flavorful quality food!",

Great atmosphere - very upscale yet comfortable setting.",

    "text": "This is not the best Asian restaurant in AZ (as some people have said), but this place IS definitely one of the better Asian FUSION-style restaurants around. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. The owner (Tottie herself) came around and spoke to everyone in the place.  We started with salmon satay and the small plate combo for appetizers. Everything was excellent (even the presentation with the little hibachi). My brother and I had the curry duck as entrees and we were both very happy with our selections. However, I think I enjoyed eating off my wife's plate of soft-shelled crab curry more. My mom had the salmon with basil-ginger sauce as she loved it. I'm not exactly sure what my sister had, but it was a seafood plate. She seemed to really enjoy her meal as well. Often times, it can be difficult for a large group of people to eat at the same place and for everyone to enjoy it. Tottie's was the exception.  A quick note of caution when ordering: they make VERY spicy dishes. You can ask them to not make it too spicy, so don't worry. They will provide you with more chili oil if you really need it.   As for dessert, Tottie's is one of the few Asian restaurants that have a decent dessert selection. Everyone in my party was too full to eat any (including me), but I wanted to see try something out anyway. I ordered the fried honey banana was very happy with it. It wasn't too heavy or too light at the end of my meal (plus, it came with some of their non-dairy ice cream). They make their ice cream with coconut milk, rather than cow juice. Very nice!",

I mean the fact that they see these dishes time and time again and are still excited by them....! Then flash forward to the next day and if you're heating up second lunch (I like to eat) in the office micro and employees comment on the delicious smells, yeah you're doing a-ok! I was solo this time because Gabi M was home with baby Mess and I didn't think to call Jarred (sorry bud!). Eating alone certainly wasn't as much fun but it was delicious. Eggplant is a must. You just HAVE TO get it, done. In addition I also had a really yummy chicken dish with wide noodles, veggies, basil, and a spicy/sweet sauce. SO tasty. The portions are enormous, so don't balk at the prices. Grab two entrees, share with the group, take home leftovers...that simple ;).  Know Before You Go:  I'm only in Scottsdale one every other month and Tottie still remembers me when I come in, and that rocks! Big fan.",

    "text": "Sad.  So sad.  We've been looking for GOOD Chinese since moving to Scottsdale three years ago. So, after checking with Yelp and reading such glowing reviews, I recommended Totties, and noticing they have a new location nearer to home, we went to Totties 2.  Now I'm wondering if I was in the same restaurant as my fellow Yelpers who gave it 5 Stars.   Atmosphere was upscale and pretty. We were seated, and asked if we wanted something to drink. They have beer and wine on the menu, but we'd walked through a full bar/lounge area on the way to our table. We asked what kind of Vodkas were available. Our server was befuddled and left to retrieve the bartender who could better advise and take our order. This should have been a sign of what to expect. The bartender arrived in short order, and informed us the upper end of their inventory would be Absolute. Not thrilled, we persevered and ordered one on the rocks. No inquiry re garnish, Drink arrived sans garnish and when we asked for olives, they had none. Bartender apologized and said this was only his fourth day.   We thought - \"OK, this is Totties 2 - we've caught them in the throes of a new operation and they're just working the bugs out. We'll cut them some slack\" - becoming empathetic to their plight.  On to the meal. We ordered Hot and Sour Soup and Totties Pork Spring Rolls. Spring rolls arrived, four presented on a very large platter, more than half of which was very strangely covered with green leaf and mache lettuce. Spring rolls were just OK, and my thought was these were from Sysco rather than the implied home made by Tottie.   The Hot and Sour Soup was an enormous portion - obviously meant for two. It was mediocre at best, and had a consistency and texture that again lead me to think this was not freshly prepared but more out of a plastic bag provided by some food service company.   For us, Kung Pao is generally a good gauge of preparation. This version didn't have the traditional peanuts, BUT it did have zucchini. Very odd.   Finally, I tried the Egg Foo Yung, and asked for it to be prepared with pork. Large portion, but nothing special. Drowning in brown sauce. (One thing that struck us as strange, all the food was the same brown color.)   Toward the end of the meal, we received a visit from a woman who turned out to be Tottie herself. We introduced ourselves, and inquired how long the new location had been open. She replied \"Six months\" when we more expected her to say 'six days'. We were more than a little aghast.   For us, Totties 2 was just a sad thing all around.   Our quest for decent Chinese continues.",

Tottie Rolls are fantastic and one of the highlights of the menu with a variety of flavors and textures in on delectable package. The Thai Noodle dishes do not disappoint and the Pho is a great create your own adventure. As a general rule, the Thai and Vietnamese dishes are better than the Chinese dishes.

Aside form being spicy, the food left little to the imagination and was disappointing.  The vegetables were overcooked and bordered on being soggy and the chicken was overcooked and tough.

Based on the positive reviews here, being out of town on business and not wanting to stick with the status quo, I thought I'd give it a shot.    I probably should have stayed on par for course, but it wasn't all bad.   I arrived during happy hour and indulged in some Asian Tapas, which I found interesting since there was no mention of Spanish food within the Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese tilt of the restaurant.  Decor was interesting, if not a bit overdone.  But with artwork from 3 different cultures in one location, it works.  The restaurant itself appeared to be very clean, and I was greeted with smiles from every employee.  Started off w/the Shu Mai, which was in all honesty, a little salty (more on that later),  but pretty gosh darn good.  Followed those up with the vegetarian gyoza, which were....different.  The wrapping was soggy and the filling was a mish mash of overcooked and perfectly cooked veggies.  Main entree was the Thai Stir Fry with Shrimp.  First bite was excellent!  The shrimp practically melted in my mouth, and the vegetables offered excellent contrast.  Excellently seasoned, cooked to a level of crunchy perfection.  As I continued to eat however, my enthusiasm slowly started to dwindle.  The saltiness of the meal was overwhelming the level of spice that I requested, which should never, ever happen.  (5 on a scale of 7)  Nobody should eat an Asian meal and not expect a certain level of sodium, but I left very disappointed.",

From the minute we walked in to the minute we left the restaurant. We were greeted with Arizona hospitiality and was quickly seated. As we took a look around, the theme of the restaurant was surperb.

The GF BF and I were craving some Vietnamese food last Friday night after the gym (yes, we are wild and crazy!) and found this new little gem based on your reviews!! You certainly steered us to a yummy spot!   I was immediately pleased when we stepped in the door as the decor is very pretty with lots of cool, solid woods and very interesting pieces of art! We were quickly seated in the room adjacent to the bar and found a fun, joyous atmosphere surrounding us!   We were starving so we immediately order the traditional spring rolls and some hot tea. They were fantastic! Superb peanut sauce and I am huge fan when they actually grill the pork, which Tottie's most certainly does! We wolfed these down and I seriously could have eaten 100 more!   Next, we had the Papaya Salad with sticky rice and chicken and the Beef Pho. The sticky rice was amazing and the flavors and freshness of the papaya salad and chicken were fantastic! The beef pho was also very good, but since I just had Pho with Oxtail stock from Monsoon in Seattle, I'm a little picky right now! Still, very very good!   At this point, we were stuffed, but I know we'll be back again this week to try a few more items! Love that they have a variety of Asian cuisines to satisfy any craving (including my fav - sizzling rice soup!)! Now if I can just get Tottie to add a delish egg crepe and pork buns...I would never leave and she would earn that last coveted star!!  P.S. Very very accommodating and understanding with food allergies, especially gluten free!",

    "text": "I am the biggest fan of Pho.  Even when it is 110 degrees I will still eat Pho until I burst.  I am constantly looking for a place that is close by my house and that has decent Pho.  I've tried it at many places near me, and none of them are up to par with what I'm looking for.  Until Sunday night rolled around and I wasn't feeling well.  The only thing that makes me feel better is Pho.  Since my beloved Noodles Ranch is closed on Sundays and SO FAR AWAY I decided to yelp Pho in Scottsdale for the millionth time.  Up came Tottie's 2, a place I had all but forgotten because it's counterpart, Tottie's 1 is just a far as Noodles Ranch.  But alas!  There is one right down the street from me!  I quickly places my order of beef pho, calamari, and for my boyfriend...General Tsaos Chicken.  It was ready within 25 minutes...less than it takes to drive there...and when I tasted the Pho, I knew I had found an acceptable substitution for my beloved Noodles Ranch.  Totties 2 has the broth, noodles, and beef to cure any Pho craving.  The calamari was great and my boyfriend loved his dish!  I most certainly will be going to Tottie's 2 again for Pho and whatever else might tickle my fancy.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING GOOD PHO CLOSE TO MY HOUSE!!",

My dad, when initially served, found that part of his salmon was cold, so he had to send it back. But they promptly fixed the issue, and then he found it to be really good.

We had the sampler and if there are more than 4 people, you better order two of them. We shared dishes, and we all agreed it was all very tasty. But the big surprise of the evening were the gorgeous Taiwanese dancers! Two lovely young ladies performed to the music and their movements were totally in sync. I think they will be there every Thurs. and Sat. nights, but you should call and check ahead of your reservation. What a great night of food, service and entertainment.",

    "text": "(Review started years ago, but I'm just finishing now...)  Mom was craving for soft-shelled crabs in red curry, so I took her to her favorite place for it, but at the \"new\" location.  We've been to the one on Thomas and Hayden, which was where we discovered the delectable entree.  (For the record, I also love this dish, but I have a shellfish allergy, and I already partook in crabs a couple of weeks ago and didn't want to have a severe reaction.  I'll enjoy more crabs in May, perhaps.)  This new location, on Scottsdale Rd just south of Lincoln Ave, is gorgeous!  The entrance is kind of cramped, with the tables and decor crowding the walkway, but we got over it.  Aside from that, the interior designer did a good job with furniture, art and fabrics placement-- a feast for the eyes, which is a big part of my enjoyment when I dine out!  (Current time...)  Mom and I have tried the happy hour menu years ago, and it was OK.  I believe the offer then was $3 per app (about two bites each), or $10 for three apps.  The food portions on the hh menu seemed tiny, especially if you count that a dip saucer amount of seaweed salad would cost you $3 a la carte.  Can't recall if Mom tried the sushi-- perhaps photos will reveal that she did.  (Please cross-reference my reviews of the Tottie's on Thomas/Hayden here. <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/totties-asian-fusion-scottsdale-2?hrid=WkkH6VsvzPzD3-ZhzlUw7Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))\">yelp.com/biz/totties-asi...</a>  Mom still enjoys the soft-shelled crab curry here and at the original location at Thomas and Hayden.  The sizes of the crabs (two crabs cut in halves) have shrunken over the years, so we've been ordering an extra side (one crab cut in half) at an additional $3.  I have given up gambling with my crab allergy for a year, or two now, as the symptoms get worse and worse that the pain and suffering aren't worth the temporary joy of eating them, but the reason I still look forward to dining with Mom here is that Tottie's is one of the very few THai/Asian restaurants I can rely on serving egg noodles as a side, at an additional cost of course, albeit very thin ones (similar to ramen).  I also love the green curry and beef lo mein!  Lastly, the fried banana and homemade coconut ice cream dessert is not to be missed.  Tottie's also serves mango and sticky rice, which I enjoyed before I tested positive for rice allergy.  (If you want a great sliced mango over black sticky rice dessert, PM me for another Scottsdale location!  Lunch UYEs here and at a non-Tottie's location, perhaps?  Let me know and we'll make them happen!)  p.s.  Don't forget to try the Thai iced tea!  Mom and I always split one, with an extra glass of ice, and I ALWAYS consider ordering a second one, but Mom always talks me out of it, which is a good decision.  Always better to leave wanting for more, than to leave feeling like a glutton and - most often than not - bloated-- ugh!  Oh, and Tottie's offers at least four different mimosa options, in lieu of the traditional champagne and orange juice.  Guava, mango, and perhaps peach, and grapefruit?  I think I tried the guava or peach once (<a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/totties-asian-fusion-scottsdale-2?hrid=WkkH6VsvzPzD3-ZhzlUw7Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)\">yelp.com/biz/totties-asi...</a>. You may have to check older reviews for more photos).  It's OK, and I may try the mango sometime, but it's really all about the Thai iced tea, and whether you share it with someone else, or not, ask for that extra glass of ice to help water down the sweetness.  You may thank me later!  :)",

Plus it has the added benefit of several styles of Asian cuisine so my wife gets to eat Thai food (which I detest) and I can get something I enjoy from the Chinese portion of the menu.  The portions are HUGE. While the price is also high, you do get the bang for your buck. And they don't skimp on the meat either, which I have found to be an issue at other Asian restaurants. Virtually every bite of fried rice had chicken and the ratio of broccoli to beef was 2:1 - very reasonable. An added bonus, the fried rice was not greasy at all (though by the end of the meal, the salt had dried out my mouth big time). My wife said her curry was great. And we all had leftovers.  That wait staff was very nice, although the decor is pretty forgettable. There was also no kids menu (although that was fine with me as it meant I got to secretly order another dish mainly for myself). The lunch deal is especially good as the meals come with salads, rice and egg rolls.",

We literally (truly not exaggerating) sat at the table for 35 minutes before anyone even came over to ask us what we would like to drink. At that point we were ready to order and the waitress argued that she was only taking our drink orders. 15 minutes later we got our drinks. 14 minutes later we got our appetizers. Two people then got entrees (one was a soup). 20 minutes later all but one of us got the rest of our food. The waitress didn't even check on us to see that one couple still had not gotten our food. Not once was there an apology or communication about what was going on. There was absolutely no excuse for the lack of customer service. They just kept saying that they were busy. We got there at 5:30 and didn't leave until 8. They charged us a gratuity and did not even attempt to rectify the experience. They were busy but they knew they would be and were a complete mess. People all around us were concerned and complaining. Again, we were there at 5:30. I can't even imagine what the rest of the guests experienced. Never going back.",

    "text": "Tottie your food is pretty darn hottie! Where do I begin with the feast. We ate family style, so we started with spring rolls, soup and cucumber salad. Each item was tasty but not filling enough so that I didn't want to move on to the next course -- just enough to wet the appetite for more. So on to the next course. For the entree, we had Singapore rice noodles with curry, Chicken and noodles (I think it was called Chicken Chow Fun), the hot and spicy eggplant and a tofu salad plus white and brown rice. Each dish complimented each other and provided a perfect blend of tastes. I enjoyed every bite and couldn't stop eating. It was just too delicious. Of everything, my favorites were the chicken noodle dish, the shrimp curry and the eggplant. I loved the arrangement of spices. Each bite hit a different part of my taste buds.   The decor of Tottie's is filled with authentic character True to the cuisine. If I didn't know better, if I closed my eyes I could just as easily  be in a SF restaurant. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. It has the True feel of a neighborhood restaurant and I got the sense that those who visit a lot are probably known by name. But for those newbies like myself, they still made me feel at home and as if I'd been coming there for years!  To end the amazing meal, we tried the Fried Honey Banana. It was a perfectly sized dessert to share with four and incredibly sweet so you could have a taste and be completely satisfied. And what's an Asian Fusion meal without a fortune cookie! So I opened my fortune cookie expecting some random sentence that didn't really make much since. But instead, my fortune read: \"You will be recognized and honored as a community leader.\" Ok Tottie. I'll take that! Finally a fortune that makes some sense. :)  So until next time Tottie's Asian Fusion...you are now one of my new favorite Asian Fusion restaurants in town.",

    "text": "I could have sworn that I already reviewed Totties before but maybe not.   I've been there 3 times and the food is consistently delicious.  The restaurant itself if pretty small but I love the decor, it feels very homey, and they have a cute patio for warmer times of the year.    First let me rave about our waitress.  We sat in Lottie's (no that's not a typo) section and she was so amazing.  She has the most warm and friendly personality, was really helpful with suggestions, didn't wince one bit for special requests, and made the whole dining experience that much more enjoyable.  Ask for her when you go there!!   Okay, on with the food!  I went with my parents and we had the Calamari, Edamame, Pho Tai, Salmon Satay, Veggie Fried Rice, Pad Thai, and coconut ice cream.    1. Calamari- $5 on the happy hour menu, whoop whoop! The calamari comes with a panang (I think... its like a coconut curry) sauce and the breading is extra crunchy, not oily like some fried calamari can be so that was quite delectable!  2. The Pho Tai-  my favorite. It comes with a delicious broth, noodles, and beef (I'm not really a beef person so I just ate around it).  The soup also comes with  basil, cilantro, plum sauce, siracha, and bean sprouts on the side for you to customize it which I think is very cool.  My dad and I shared a soup and asked Lottie if they could split it in two bowls and the portions were still huge.  The broth was so delicious that I just added the bean sprouts, basil, and cilantro and no sauces.  My dad added the sauces and omitted some of the other items and it was like we had two totally different soups!   3. Salmon Satay- I was way too into my soup to care about the salmon satay (my mom ordered it).  I tried a bite just so i could yelp about it (loser, much?) but I was on food overload and so I failed on that.  Sorry! My mom wouldn't stop talking about how good it was though and it was on the HH menu for just $5.   4. Edamame- You know what edamame tastes like.  5. Veggie fried rice- I only had like 2 bites because I was so full from the calamari and shrimp so I'll have to update this after I have it tomorrow for lunch!  6. Pad Thai- This was my first time trying Pad Thai and I really liked it!  Again, I could only fit like 2 bites in but it was tangy, sweet, and very fresh tasting.    7. Coconut ice cream- Gahhhhhh this stuff is amazing!! Tottie herself makes it almost every day and it is sooooo good.  She uses coconut milk instead of dairy and there are little pieces of coconut in it and it is like a tropical heaven in your mouth.  Sadly, I could only have like 3 bites of this due to my prior gluttony.   ...Okay, I'll update late! But in the mean time, get your tushes to Totties! :)",

We had five entree dishes between four adults and three kids.  Each entree would serve 2 to 3 people easily.   Easily over half what we ordered was leftover. I felt the waitress could have let us know.   Since we are flying out of town, and therefore no point in wrapping for another day- it meant a lot of wasted food which I dislike.   Other than that, 5 stars.  Fast service and nice location.",

The sugarcane chicken is always a must start not only fresh the yummy chicken on sugar cane you grill at the table but the plated loaded with fresh mint, cilantro, lettuce & other goodies that comes accompanies it. For less adventurous eaters their basis Pad Thai is as equally fresh but I stress to try something you never have. You will not be disappointed. My dad is not an Asian eater but his Salmon in Basil Ginger sauce was sublime & now he'll go at the drop of a hat. Another fabulous fact...amazing cocktails & happy hour price of $5.00 for a normally $9.00 drink ...wonderful!!!!!",

    "text": "Don't come into Tottie's expecting traditional cuisine. What you'll get here is that traditional dish that you wanted, with Tottie's own interpretation on it. She prepares Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Sushi, with the Tottie twist on it.   The atmosphere has a lot left over from when this used to be the French fine dining spot Methode Bistro. It's cozy, warm, casual, and very inviting and Tottie is a very friendly lady who loves to talk bout food, share ideas, and greet all of her customers. In fact, I was not having the best of experiences here until Tottie came over to see me, since her servers had zero knowledge of the Asian dishes they were serving people, but Tottie was a little more knowledable. Scratch that, a lot more knowledgable.  My Bun Thit Nuong Tom Cha Gio was presented in a way that was very different, using traditional ingredients but with a few extra ideas thrown in like field greens, extra carrots, and a little different style of presentation. The server informed me, upon finding out how much Vietnamese I eat, that I would find this dish very different because it came with a unique Tottie Sauce...... it was traditional Nuoc Mam, LOL! Despite the confusion, the food was top, top, top quality. Very fresh and crisp veggies, good cuts of pork, huge shrimp, and crisp egg rolls. I was truly happy with the dish, despite it being different from what I'm used to.   At the price point $10 a bowl of Bun Thit, it's one of the more expensive fixes in town, but given the quality and atmosphere, I'd go here again and not think twice about the extra couple of bucks.",

The interior is very open, with a classy feel and high ceilings. The staff was all extremely welcoming throughout the entire dining experience.   We started with a few appetizers, my favorite being the Spicy Cucumber salad, which was so delicious. I'd never tried anything like it before. We split a few entrees, some common staples (Pad Se Ew and a shrimp curry), but the entree that unexpectedly stood out was the Hot and Spicy Eggplant. I've never ever had eggplant prepared like that - the strips were cooked so they almost melted in your mouth (not chewy like I anticipated), and were soaked in a dark brown sweet and spicy sauce. Amazing!  We were far too stuffed to try dessert, but I can only imagine how good that would have been. A five star spot for sure!",

I decided to give this place a try since it had such great reviews and by the look of the prices, I was hoping they would have the flavor I was craving.  Boy did they ever and more even than I could even fit in my stomach! The prices are reasonable for being in Scottsdale/Paradise Valley and the portions are very large.  The wonton soup left me so impressed I started ordering takeout once a week from this place.  So far I have tried the tangerine chicken, the sesame chicken, the mongolian beef and the wonton soup.  All have been delicious and all have left me looking forward to eating the left overs the next day.  You cannot go wrong with this place.  Even though I have a PF Changs on my way home from work, I will be stopping here to get takeout if that is what is needed for dinner.  I can't wait to try everything that they have to offer!

Ha ha Tottie is a friend, and a very special lady. Not only is her food delicious but, she is very friendly and welcoming with her customers, despite the fact that she is a very busy lady.  She is often in the back, personally helping with the cooking and supervising in the kitchen. I admire her.  I have a fondness for Asian food (mainly Thai and Vietnamese). And, all the dishes I have tried here.  Including, desserts are so D- Licious!  :-) I have a very high tolerance and passion for spicy food. Twice I asked for my Panang curry \"Thai spicy\" and they definitely delivered to my satisfaction (and to most people's spicy level of horror, I'm sure). It seared and numbed my mouth so well that I was very impressed. I rarely get anything spicy enough (to my satisfaction), even when I specifically request it. But, if you don't appreciate spicy as I do, that's ok because they can make yours mild or medium. Just pay attention to the menu and make your specific requests (within reason, of course). There are also, plenty of yummy options for the health conscious. Including two of my faves: Bun Tom salad (with rice noodles, lettuce, sliced grilled pork & shrimp and, sliced Vietnamese-style egg rolls,). As well as an appetizer of Vietnamese Spring rolls.",

Alex had been to Totties Asian Fusion II very recently and was so impressed (believe me, this guy is discerning, so for him to give something a thumb's up -- you'd best believe it) that he organized an outing/evening for like 10 big ol' bears of men for a sake bomber happy hour & dinner.   See Alexander's review for exact details and descriptions of what we ordered and ate, but I'm going to make this review short & sweet.  Tottie's rocks. The service was impeccable.  Tottie herself came to our table and made special recommendations on food.  I've never felt so attended to by a restaurateur before.  This lady knows her stuff in the front of the house, but even more so, she can cook her petite Asian ass off.  EVERYTHING we had was amazing and her Thom Kha Kai soup blew my socks off.  I crave....for days...  The parking lot's a little wonky now during construction, but it's a small price to pay for this level of amazing food.  We were 10 hungry heffers when we arrived (not one of us under 200 pounds, so you know we like to eat) and no one walked outta the place hungry or needing ANYTHING.  Service & food to the max.    I applaud Tottie for opening a second killer location and I thank Alex for introducing us to this amazing pocket of awesomeness deliciousness!",

It way too much food for two people but we wanted to try a few dishes and will definitely have leftovers for a few more meals! I do wish the side of rice was a bit bigger though. There was only enough rice for maybe a third of the curry. I also thought the Thai spice level was a bit off. The Tom kha (level 3) was spicier than the pad Thai (level 5).   It took about 10-15 minutes for us to be greeted once we sat down but after that the service was on point. It wasn't the best Thai or Chinese food I've had but I would definitely come back next time I get the craving.",

We came on a Saturday evening around 8pm and were seated right away. We ordered Tom yum soup with shrimp, pad see ew, and green chicken curry. The tom yum soup came out surprisingly fast! But once I tasted it, I knew why- the soup was VERY concentrated and tasted as if it was sitting in the kitchen for a long time. I added a cup of water to dilute it and it tasted a lot better. After the tom yum soup, it took about 30 minutes for the other dishes to come out. Both dishes were just missing the \"kick\" that I love so much in Thai food. They both were too sweet and just tasted like something was missing! Maybe it was because I came an hour before closing, but I just felt like the food was average.",

We ordered probably 8 different dishes among our group of 6. My favorite appetizer here is always the Tottie Rolls - crispy fried egg rolls that come with lettuce and herbs, as well as a sweet dipping sauce. You wrap the egg rolls and herbs in the lettuce, dip, and enjoy. The lettuce and herbs make fried egg rolls super refreshing and insanely satisfying.   Another one of my favorites was the Bun Tom, which is another refreshing yet satisfying dish on the menu.   I'm not sure you can go wrong here. I'd recommend checking out happy hour, too, when they have discounted apps and drinks.",

It wasn't too salty or greasy. The pineapple was really refreshing. The panang curry was very good and I ordered it slightly spicy. I think it's hard to get this wrong. The consistency was there and the peanut flavor was balanced. I'm glad that there's pho here. The broth was good. It came hot and aromatic. It was lacking a little in savoriness? Maybe I should've added salt? Broth can taste weird in the valley because of tap water and a restaurant's recipe. I wish that there were options to add extra noodles at least or a larger portion.  The restaurant itself is very pretty inside and was clean.",

Typical fun Asian themed with some crazy dragons when you walk through to the main dining area and some pretty fun art.   I've been twice for lunch and haven't been disappointed at all, both with friends and they all loved it. Which is massive compliment because I only taking people to good places or it looks bad on me.   For starters had the shrimp wontons twice now. The other crab puffs and they have this salad that comes with lunch and I'm literally drinking the dressing when it's done, great stuff.   For the main course I have Kung Pao beef at level 6 out of 7. I'm going for 7 next time to try it. Regardless the plate is finished every time. The flavor, the heat level spice and temp, the mix with veggies, and fried rice is fantastic. My friends tried the pad Thai and they loved it as well. So two dishes absolutely wonderful and I'm going to try more.   The service is great the ladies that served me were fun and very accommodating to all the sauce nonsense I eat and very quick. I will for sure be back and loved the whole experience.",

The service, however, is slow.  We were a table of nine, which is a problem if the kitchen staff is small, but that shouldn't be the case in so large and well-attended a restaurant.  The last entree came out seven minutes after the first -- one here, one there, as if they could only do a couple of dishes at a time.  This is not a big thing, unless you are in a hurry or on a bad date, so it's probably not enough to keep me away.  But it will -- go figure.",

The Panang with shrimp is the best item on their menu IMO. Full of flavor and vegetables. The green curry is good too, but the Panang is superior.  My favorite Thai dish is usually Pad Thai with shrimp. For whatever reason the Pad Thai here is about a 2.5. It's covered in way too much sauce, bland, and the noodles are underwhelming. If you know good Pad Thai, this is the polar opposite. I haven't been to Thailand yet but some of the Pad Thai in Hiroshima made me realize what the dish should taste like.  Happy hour Kirin and Kirin light are $2.50...outstanding value.  You will leave full and if you stick to a curry you should expect to enjoy Totties.",

This was MORE than enough food for three people. The Chow Mien was good but lacked a little flavor, nothing a little chili sauce didn't fix. The Orange Chicken was very good, small pieces of chicken that was crisped to perfection and the perfect amount of sesame on top!   I would come back!",

Increase the price of your drinks, but don't charge me for plain old ice machine ice. I would never come back to a restaurant that nickels and dimes me for ICE!

I ordered takeout and a friend picked it up so I wasn't able to scope out the ambiance. So this review is based on takeout food quality only.   We started with the appetizer that was like a sampler (I don't remember what they called it.) My favorite thing of the whole meal was the potstickers with the sauce that came with it. These were tasty. Everything else in this app I could go without. The chicken skewers were super dry with little flavor. And the egg rolls, meh. For the main course I ordered the spicy cucumber salad with chicken. Spicy it was, but flavorful it was not. Heat that is lacking flavor is no fun. You can tell they also put way too hot chicken in the cold salad so it made the cucumbers taste very soggy and warm. It was so funky that I didn't eat it, I shared with my friend. She ordered the chicken with garlic sauce. It was okay, but nothing special. It barely had any chicken in it and was full of water chestnuts. Don't get me wrong, I love water chestnuts! But this was just over the top.   Even though I was not impressed, I will return to try this place in person. I want to trust my fellow yelpers and hopefully they will come through for me!",

    "text": "4.5 stars   Oh Tottie's. I think I love you because our names are similar... Beyond that, you have earned my love based on your DELICIOUS food and friendly service!   The first time I went to Tottie's it was for my Favorite Bear's birthday party. I arrived before Happy Hour ended and scored a Sake Bomber (or two?) before we were seated for dinner. I let the birthday boy handle all of the ordering. He knows what I like! I don't remember exactly what all we had but I do know that I want an IV drip of her curry sauce in my arm at all times. I also enjoyed her pork belly lettuce cups. Yep, PORK BELLY. It was so good!   The second visit I had, I ordered a duck with creamy curry noodle dish. It was not on the menu, and you're lucky if you can get it, but if you do, I wouldn't mind if you named your next child after me. You're welcome. The duck was tender and flavorful. The noodles were perfectly cooked with the most delicious creamy, spicy curry sauce. I could eat it every day. Seriously. During our meal, our server was friendly but a little absentminded. She also seemed like she was new because she wasn't terribly knowledgeable on the menu. At the end of my meal, Tottie asked me about my food and thanked me for coming in.   I am looking forward to my next visit to Tottie's The food is great, the servings are huge, the prices are reasonable. I know 5 stars from me is in their future!",

This was the best dish at our table so it's a shame we didn't get more. Tottie rolls had good crunch, but typical egg roll flavor so nothing special. Got the pad thai and they use a thin, fine vermicelli noodle instead of the traditional flat noodle. Also, there was too much gooey sauce that turned it into a pile of mush. Sorry, it just wasn't that great.",

    "text": "You must try the Tangerine Shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about the to-go dinner that I ordered for my bf and I from Tottie's 2 last night. Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm. Scrumptiousness!  But back to the Tangerine Shrimp, it's sweet, it's a little sour, it's drenched in a blackish glaze (so don't freak out if it looks like black globs of shrimp, like I did), it's surrounded by orange slices, it's fried in tempura.... and it's amazing. Judging by looks alone, this dish does not look appetizing. But what it lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for in taste. You will be missing out if you don't try it.  Now on to the rest of the Tottie's extravaganza, we ordered:  - Kung Pao Shrimp - Fresh and crisp vegetables chopped into little cubes, tons of whole peanuts and succulent meaty shrimp in a spicy soy flavored sauce. Peanuts and shrimp in every bite!  - Scallops with Black Bean Sauce - Fresh veggies and HUUUUGE meaty scallops in the most amazingly flavorful yet light black bean sauce I've ever tasted. OMG good.  - Pad Thai with Chicken - Thai stir fried noodles (not overcooked and not undercooked, instead they were moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection!) yummy fried egg pieces, crisp bean sprouts, shredded carrots, flavorful chicken (it was moist! not dry at all!), and topped with millions of crushed peanuts. Pad Thai heaven.  - Fried Won Tons - For only about $6 you get 10 of these little drops from heaven. Won tons encasing pork and formed into little ball-like shapes - I'm astounded that I liked these as much as I did, as I'm not a huge pork fan. But the meat inside was so moist! And flavorful! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as a spicy mustard sauce, another True taste bud delight.  Now, a couple of notes before you head on over to Tottie's 2:  - Portions are pretty large. We had leftovers, but I must admit that I stuffed myself silly with food. - For the high quality of the food, the price point at Tottie's is excellent. Yeah, it's on the pricier side of Asian Fusion food, but it didn't feel like Tottie hijacked my wallet. Entree's are around $10-12 each depending on if you pick shrimp, chicken or beef (shrimp will always be the most expensive - but SO worth it, as this is high quality seafood). - Take out is an excellent option if you don't feel like eating at the restaurant. It's fast and easy. - Their online menu has sushi items on it, but if you go to the N. Scottsdale Rd location they don't serve sushi. Originally I had tried to order some but on the phone I was informed that sushi isn't on their menu - so if this is what you desire, go to the spot on East Thomas Road.  Hands down, the best Asian food I've tried in the valley. I'm officially a Tottie's 2 addict. I was so immensely satisfied with this meal, and now I'm dreaming about the leftovers I have for lunch...",

They offer a lot of lunch specials but I wanted to bring home food for my family so I ordered off the regular menu.  The pan-fried noodles with beef, chicken, and shrimp is excellent! The vegetables are fresh and crisp and there is a nice amount of meat throughout the dish.  The sauce is sweet and delicious.  Their calamari appetizer has just the right amount of spice in it.  My kids love the House Fried rice here as well as the egg drop soup.  My husband likes his food spicy which is about a 6 here (they will gladly explain the range for you and give you their suggestions).  I heard the ladies at the table next to me raving about their homemade coconut and mango ice cream (I know they make serveral flavors in house).  Will definitely have to save room for that next time!",

I had the kung pao chicken, on a 9/10 spiciness level. My friend had the chicken pad thai, I think 8/10 hot. Our food didn't take long to come out, and I was surprised at the meat - rice ratio (more meat than I thought). The only bummer was that the chicken was hardly spicy at all, but it did taste great. As far as the service, it was fine until it took about 15 minutes for us to get our check, as the server didn't even come near our table to check on us. Would I go back? Probably",

The hot-n-sour came in a bowl the size of a trough and was so very sour.  The broth was very gelatinous and the soup contained very few goodies like Chinese mushroom, pork, or even tofu.  It was mostly gooey broth.   The dinner items we order were pretty standard fair: General Tao, Mongolian beef, and sesame chicken. The presentation was very nice and the food arrived promptly, but it had absolutely no flavor, no zing, no punch, at all.  It seemed so very underseasoned  It was so bland we didn't finish any of it.  Considering the price, we're not likely to go back.",

A must order is their Tottie Rolls (amazing spring rolls you wrap up in romaine with mint and Thai basil and a sweet gingery ponzu like sauce), to die for. The Tom Kah Gai is super flavorful and you can do it yourself with the spicy, 1-7. Lastly i truly believe their pad thai is the best I've ever had, i think its the noodles, super fresh great texture.

What?  Oh yes. We're talking burning desire going on here.  Standout are the veg spring rolls, spicy cucumber salad and bean curd/veggies stir fry that may not look so exciting on the menu, but it did unspeakable things to my taste buds.   The Shanghai bordello atmosphere is the perfect backdrop to the entire shebang, I mean, experience.",

    "text": "Totties is a great place to grab Chinese- especially on a budget! The prices are not cheap, but you get about three times the average restaurant portion size in one entree. Seriously.   My boyfriend and I ventured to Totties for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The place is overly decorated with Asian/Indian-esque decor (elephants, bamboo plants, etc). It gives off a nice vibe in somewhat of a cheesy way. Anyhow, when we were there, the restaurant was completely silent, aside from the cooking chefs in the back and the couple seated next to us. Not a big deal.   We happened to come in during happy hour and decided that we would try some happy hour entrees (not aware of the large portion sizes to come). We ordered the fried calamari and the veggie gyoza. Both came out in about 10 minutes within ordering. The fried calamari was delicious. It wasn't too rubbery or chewy, and came with a warm curry sauce that wasn't hot enough to destroy the taste of the calamari. The veggie gyoza was alright. It came with 5 pieces, and they were practically falling apart in the dish full of some soy sauce- like dip. They were a little lacking in flavor, but not too bad to complain about.  Our food came out shortly after. My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken on a spicy level of 4, and I got the chow fun on a spicy level of 5, which actually came out as chow mien (pretty much the same dish but with different noodles). My boyfriends chicken was really good! The chicken wasn't overly breaded, and had the perfect amount of sauce on it- not to mention the GIGANTIC portion. It also came with what I'd image a 16 oz bowl of fried rice. My chow mien was really good, and I enjoyed that the noodles weren't overly greasy or drenched in sauce.   Now, I'm sure you're wondering how this review warrants three stars. Well, I'll tell you. After being filled with the happy hour apps we'd eaten, I couldn't finish much of my 3lbs of chow meien. That being said, of course I asked for it to be boxed. The buss boy, or whoever it was, took my dish into the back and brought out the traditional style small Chinese food take out boxes with my food in it. Uhm, excuse me, but if I order and pay for all the chow mien that you bring me, I expect to get it by the time I leave. I felt somewhat robbed, as I know I could have used my leftovers for a solid two meal servings. It was a four, but this little mishap knocked it down to a three. Whatever.   Anyhow. To sum it up, will we be back? Of course. I just have to make sure that I'm on an empty stomach and don't order appetizers so that I can finish enough food so that ALL my leftovers can be given to me.  Food- 8.5/10  Service- 7/10  Atmosphere- 7/10 Prices- 7.5/10",

I thought the food was a little pretentious that it is your same type of Asian food but dressed up a little, yet it wasn't actually changed enough to look or taste different. There was no actual creativity or innovation that would make this a True Asian fusion place. It's more a mishmash of various Asian cuisines being available on one menu. I ordered the sampler and a couple things from the small plate menu. Everything pretty much tasted the same with no differentiation despite having different sauce pairing. The sauces didn't taste anything different than your common sauces you would get at a Thai restaurant. While the food was not terribly exciting, it was decent. I just wish the presentation would be more down to earth and just have chicken skewers be chicken skewer and not have to be served with a burner for novelty effect.",

I ordered my usual Thai delight, pad thai with chicken and brown rice.  With the lunch special you get a nice salad first which was tasty.  The bowl was a bit oddly shaped and all of the dressing fell to the bottom and it was hard to toss.  The Pad Thai was served in a huge portion with a spring roll.  It was plenty.  I ordered it \"medium\" and it was nice and spicy, so beware that their \"medium\" is pretty hot by scale.  All in all it was a great experience.  I was in and out for less than $10.00 with a full belly and smile on my face.",

It's rare that I sweat in the desert. Talk about a system clearer! And, isn't that the way great Thai should be, after all? The best part about the heat? The flavor! The lemon beef spring rolls were delicious- wonderfully fresh. The shrimp was clean, large and abundant. No tiny, briny jewels of the sea for Tottie's! The portions were large enough for my guest and I to take home leftovers for two more people (yes, your assumption is correct- we didn't want to sit at table with them).   I must confess- the aftermath? Well... reality is what reality is. Thai hot in, Thai hot out. I could actually feel the heat coming off the water. It was like hovering above a porcelain bayou. For food like this? It was more than worth it! Looking for hottie? Head in to Tottie's!",

    "text": "There are two locations --- the first (Tottie's 1) on Thomas/Hayden next to CVS in the Fresh and Easy plaza, and the second (Tottie's 2) is on Scottsdale/Hayden next to Trader Joe's and behind Fuego de Chao. I've been a regular at Totties for almost a year now. I've been to both locations but live closer to the Scottsdale Rd location so that's my usual spot. Tottie is there everyday to make sure her business runs smoothly, and she is not just hiding in a back office.  At any point in the evening you can find her behind the bar, managing take-out, or helping the kitchen if they need it.  She is a real treat!! Her professionalism is obvious, and is complimented by her spunk and pizzazz.  Tottie is always thinking of ways to improve her offerings and menu. The Scottsdale Rd. location just added a sushi bar, and matches the quality of the sushi at Totties 1.  The happy hour prices are a great deal. I always order Peace On Earth, a vodka martini that does just the trick to help me wind down. You can also get great deals on food and apps, and happy hour runs 4-7pm everyday (even weekends!).  I love Tottie's for two main reasons -- the atmosphere and the healthy options. There are plenty of go-to Chinese, Thai, or Vietnamese food options on the menu if you're having a craving, but I usually stick with the spring rolls as my main meal. Basically its salad wrapped around beef, shrimp, pork, or chicken, and then held together with rice paper. They are so good and filling its like being able to eat a salad with your hands! Many of the entrees are large enough so that I'm still full even though I'll usually skip rice.   I could go on and on about my experiences here, but it really is five stars. I love the food, atmosphere, and owner. I've noticed many patrons are repeat customers as well.",

Food:  1) edamame: moderate sized bowl for happy hour price! 2) Ribs: you get two of them and they are tender and well slathered with BBQ sauce. Pretty good, but seemed out of place at a Thai restaurant.  3) chicken and shrimp Sui Mai: I like how it was different from the regular pork sui mai, it had a real piece of shrimp on top which was a nice touch.  4) Pad se ew: Good flavor! I liked how they book different vegetables in this dish. Well made and good execution! 5) Beef Larb: Not one of my favorites. It was sour...in a funny way. I didn't enjoy it too much. I think they need to work on the sauce of this dish. I wasn't even really sure if the beef was tender or not because I was too distracted with how weird it tasted.   6) Tom Yum Soup: Lots of ingredients! Very generous with the shrimp! I liked the presentation! It came on FIRE!   Service:  Friendly. No complaints. Checked on me several times and was good about refilling my water.   Ambiance:  A little dim for my taste, but I guess they were going for a romantic ambiance. I had a hard time seeing what I was eating.   Price:  Typical for Thai food. The whole meal came out to be $50.   Overall:  It was pretty good, but I don't know if it was good enough to come back. I might come back just for happy hour. There's some good deals on that menu!",

Tottie and her staff are extremely attentive and friendly every visit.  And the food... well, I could eat here all of the time and it would never get old!    Although our 'old standby' dishes are consistently cooked just right, we often try to order something new.  Tonight we shared the sizzle rice soup and a noodle dish that we'd never tried before... it had chow fun noodles, broccoli, bok choy, carrots, in a brown sauce.  It was delicious!  Despite being full, we also ended up trying the banana pudding... and it was the perfect sweet ending to the meal and the long day!  Each bite had just the right amount of banana, mochi, ice cream, and who knows what other surprises, but it was damn good!  ***One last reason for an update: the shopping center is still undergoing major construction.  Do no let that deter you from going in.  Tottie's is staying open through it all!",

We tasted the chicken larb and didn't touch it again. If we lived here we would come back again (and we would have told them their larb was off).",

    "text": "Tottie's is by far the most AMAZING Asian food you can get in the Valley.  I frequent Tottie's about once a week, and it never disappoints.  My favorites are the Tottie Rolls (make sure to add in the mint and cilantro they provide on the side, it makes the difference), Green Curry with chicken, and Tom Kha Gai soup.  The Tottie rolls are just unique, and are a combination of an egg roll and lettuce wrap. A definite must try.  The curry and soup are so FLAVORFUL!!  Lots of spice and aromas....mmmm......makes me hungry just thinking about it.  I've had the pleasure of both dining in and taking the food home for takeout, and I must say that both have always been easy and wonderful experiences.  If you do eat in, I recommend trying the sugarcane chicken appetizer.  It comes with a flame to give your chicken an extra grill and a to-die-for peanut sauce; definitely something to be enjoyed in the restaurant.  Plus, the ambiance is comfortable and inviting, and the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable so it is definitely worth eating in once in awhile.  Overall, A++++",

    "text": "Ordered takeout from Totties #2. Quick pickup time. We ordered the Tottie's small plate combo (appetizers) so delicious. The spring rolls were perfectly crisp and tasted even better with the sweet and sour sauce. The tempura shrimp was crispy, non greasy and had a large thick piece of shrimp underneath the perfect tempura batter. I wasn't overly impressed by the chicken satay or gyoza. But still yummy! A huge app combo, 2 of each;)  The pork Thai fried rice was spectacular. Rice was perfectly cooked, crisp bean sprouts, thin tender pieces of pork and lots of fresh basil!  The shrimp chow mein was great! Large pieces of garlic shrimp, thin noodles in perfect brown sauce and plenty of crisp veggies, broccoli snow peas onions and carrots.   Over all great delish food and we will absolutely be back here!",
