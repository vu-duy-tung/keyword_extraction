    "text": "This was our second attempt at this restaurant. First time I was there we were ignored, had a bottle of red wine splashed on us because at the next table over the server thought it would be fun to have the very drunk girls pop the cork...not so much when it went spraying everywhere. Red wine and white shirts don't go. But...it was a super busy night... so we tried again. Every place has one of those nights. So on Monday at 4:30 we went back. Hardly anyone was there, we thought great!  We will get served. WRONG. Selena was our server. Not only did she make it very clear she was bored, and totally uninterested in helping, but she also treated us like we should be so thankful she was even there to help. First off: I am aware this a beer bar, but she said that they had a full bar as I was uninterested in having a beer, great(!) I asked for a raspberry vodka with splash of tonic. The immediate response was attitude and that they only have real drinks. Ummm okay....  She then walked off with my water order and my partner's beer order. When she dropped the drinks off she turned away the moment they touched the table. We had to ask for her to stay so we could order an appetizer!  WTH. Appetizer was brought out and she never came back to see how it was or if we wanted anything else eat. FINALLY when drinks were gone and appetizer gone, she asked if we needed anything else...in such a way that very much indicated she wanted us gone. Don't worry Selena, we were done. As we had so much time waiting for anything it did give us a chance to observe. Most of the waitstaff seemed to maintain this same level of bordness and irritation. No smiles, not genuine, lots of eye rolling...not pleasant. This whole thing was super sad as our first trip the food was amazing and I was looking forward to it. The first time was grilled cheese sandwich (best ever) and the second time, even though it was only spinach dip, it was spot on. That said I have not desire to go back to a place where the team members are rude and snubbing people seems to be the MO. Don't change your food...change your waitstaff.",

I wanted to try a lot of different things on the menu including sandwiches and pizza, but I went with a chicken farm salad because I wanted something cold to cool off from the heat. It was just okay. The salad seemed somewhat one-note like it needed something to brighten it up like crunchy nuts or seeds. I ordered a side of \"sweet fries\" (sweet potato), and those were very good, so I was happy. Somewhat noisy but that's expected to a bar-like atmosphere at a late evening time.",

I thought she was just being picky so I tested it, and it just tasted like charcoal with little chicken flavor. I'm sorry but this was a less than average meal.

The service was not slow or anything, but our server had a crappy attitude, and she just was not welcoming at all. The food was okay. We had a pizza, grilled cheese, and buffalo chicken wrap between the four of us, and everyone said their food was \"okay\". The location is great, the vibe of the place is great, the beer is great.

A very comfortable & clean bar area.  We ordered a glass of their double nut brown ale and a glass of Moscato.  Both arrived quick and tasty!  We ordered their grilled cheese + avocado and a side of sweet potatoes fries, as well as their spicy burger + a side of tots.  When the food arrived, we couldn't help but note, it was a HUGE pile of sweet potatoes fries.  They could be a meal by themselves.  The burger had a good spice to it, without being overbearing.  All the food coming out to other tables looked great too.  So next time we are in the area, we will definitely stop back in.",

Another item I've chosen was the fish sandwich. It's perfect. Two fish sticks on a light bun. It's not as greasy as most fish sandwiches. Totally hits the spot. Their sides include cottage cheese (personal favorite - I was excited to see this!), sweet potato fries (addicting), tater tots (yes please), a side salad (it's quite large for a side), and regular julienned-style fries.   They have a veggie burger and gluten free options for those with dietary restrictions. Don't forget to try the desserts! I hope they cater weddings because their desserts are one of a kind.   The service is excellent. The manager, Brandon, always greets us as if we lived there...which we kind of do? But that's a story for another time. He's great! He knows his beer.   Definitely a place to catch the game and enjoy quality food. I love Fate!",

    "text": "I met my AOB buddy's S, S & T here, my choice. I saw the menu of the North location online & it looked good. S & S arrived before me & since I was in a time crunch I called S & told him what to order me.  He said what I wanted wasn't on the menu, huh? He read me the menu & I made another choice. So evidently, the two locations have different menu's. No bigee. Fate South has a beautiful building. Large, modern design feel. Nice addition to this area of South Scottsdale. Parking is on the north side & there is a lot of it.  Here's where some may get confused. There is an entrance on the north side, where the parking is and there is an entrance on the east side, facing Scottsdale Rd. If you enter via the Scottsdale Rd. doors, make sure you don't head into Plato's Closet by mistake. You can use either entrance but the door facing the parking lot lets you check out the brewing room as you move in to the dining room. Once inside the dining room you'll see the cement bar, super high ceiling and groove on a casual industrial feel. This space is VERY open which of course translates to noisy. On our visit the noise level was moderate but appropriate for a brewery restaurant. Just after I arrive & find S & S our lunch arrives. I order a drink which our server brings me right away. The service was attentive & pleasant. S ordered the Roasted Garlic burger with tots ($10). He commented that he didn't taste much roasted garlic & the patty, being \"smashed,\" was a bit overcooked. He liked the tots however. S ordered the Fate burger w/ simple salad ($9). She enjoyed the burger as prepared, thought the salad was decent for the $ and gave it a thumbs up overall. I ordered the Fire burger w/ sweet potato fries ($9). Not sure where to start. This is a burger my 9 year old son C could put together but I digress. I'll start with the positive. There was no upcharge for the sweet potato fries. Nice touch Fate. Umm, that's it for the plus's. On the negative side; the patty was small, didn't cover the bun and was a bit overcooked but passable. The sliced raw Jalapenos were sitting on the patty covered with a slice of cheddar (?) cheese but they impart only heat and not much flavor. The entire burger was just uninspired.  Great location, loud, good service, average food at best. 3 Stars.",

The design and atmosphere are great, we enjoyed sitting on the patio albeit the chairs made for persons with smaller tushies than ourselves (kinda feels like the chairs are pushing you out if you don't quite fit).   Our server was well attending and friendly. Our drinks and food came out in a timely manner.  I had a $10 Chardonnay (I picked one of the more pricey options, but didn't find it to be worth it, wish I would have just gone for one of the $6 options). My husband enjoyed their beers (as usual).   We split the bistro melt (gruyere + cappicola?) with tots as our side. It did the job but there was nothing special about it (except maybe the garlic salt they are putting on the tots? I did like that). We kept seeing a chicken club sandwich of some sort going by, and it did look delectable.  We will go back again and try different food (and different drinks for myself), but for now I'm neither impressed (other than the look & feel of the place) nor disappointed.",

I did make it back over a few weeks later for my chicken club and sadly was pretty disappointed. Bread with great but the chicken just tasted like burnt chicken, not like a True blackened (seasoned & charred) flavor. I was pretty disappointed in that but I'll still head back because the place seems great. 1 bad sandwich isn't going to hold me back. The pizza looks superb.",

I was super bummed when our company moved from our office in Old Town to Skysong because there aren't a lot of good walking distance lunch options.

I heard their grilled cheese is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> so that's next on the list. I have a feeling the patio will packed when it isn't a million degrees out.   The location is slightly off the beaten path but it's worth it. I'm all about it.",

We got menus and water and got a quick explanation of the happy hour deals and beer menu.  This place has 19 of their own beers! Yep, 19.  We decided on some flights and then chose a pint later. All the beers were pretty darn good. They also had a wide variety of styles and flavors.  My girlfriend and I needed something to snack on and decided on the pretzels n beer cheese. They came quick, were giant, and the cheese was delicious. Also came with some brown mustard that had some serious horseradish kick.  Overall this is a great place to have some quality craft beer n a snack. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Definitely recommend and will be back.",

The Meat patty tasted like it was from Costco and I'd rather have a Wendy's burger.  We also received our entree exactly 2 minutes after we received the Asian \"skinny\" wings.",

My friend Tom has been raving about the pizzas for the past month, so naturally we had to come in last night since they're half price on Mondays. The pizzas are HUGE and definitely not your average creations. My server recommended the Jess, which is definitely a good choice if you're a fan of garlic, which I definitely am! It came with both a garlic oil base and was topped with yummy roasted garlic, and also two of my other favorite pizza toppings - bacon and ricotta. Don't worry, there was some spinach to make it healthy. I stole a piece of Tom's Sow Sweet pizza, which I'll probably order next time! I love sweet+savory foods, and the combination of fig jam, prosciutto, goat cheese and apple was just perfect. I loved their Holly Haze and Spa Day IPAs, and at $11 a growler fill... sign me up! Also a huge plus - their patio is huge and spacious and dog friendly! It seems like most of their staff is dog friendly too, because they were all super sweet to my monster lab. McFate, you've definitely made a regular out of me!",

They have a large bar in the shape of a horse shoe, a good size patio, and a fairly large dining area as well. TVs are all over the place so you can catch your favorite game. Staff was very friendly and got me some sample splashes to point me in the right direction. I wish they were a little more interactive, but they were busy.

My group had to wait a little for a table and then we were seated outside, which I really loved! The patio atmosphere was great.  We waited for awhile for someone to greet us. When Jesse finally came, he took our drink orders. Maybe another ten minutes go by and he asked how we were and realized that he forgot the waters. When he came back with the waters he apologized for the bar being backed up, which is no big deal. At that moment, we started putting in food orders. He got through half of our table then turned around to the assist the table behind us and didn't come back. We were incredibly confused and thought he seemed off that night. So we had to flag him down after walking by a few times. Our drinks finally came out, some wrong, which we were charged for, but didn't want to bother with the hassle. Through out the dinner, two orders of food were brought to the table that weren't ours, but when our food came, it was all correct. The bills on the otherhand, were jumbled.   I was very unimpressed with the service, the cocktails were mediocre, and the beers were good. If I'm back in town, I will give it another chance.",

    "text": "The first stop on our Phoenix brew tour was the South Scottsdale location of McFate Brewing Company. We had a couple of flights and lunch to pregame before we headed over to Sloan Park. They were out of couple of beers, but there was a nice range in styles and a couple with unique flavors that I've never had before.  There were plenty of seats at the indoor bar where we answered opening bell with a flight of beers at 11:10 ante meridiem. But with the weather being near perfect, we probably should have grabbed a seat outside or stayed at the bar but on the portion that extended outdoors. Since we came right at opening the spacious interior was squeaky clean with concrete floors, a high ceiling, a clear view of the brewing tanks right behind us, and plenty of flat screens to watch the previous night's NBA highlights. The bar was open to the outdoors and we felt a nice breeze and had ample fresh air.  With 17 of 19 McFate beers on tap, we sampled nine of them through flights of three beers. And I can say all of them were quite tasty. The Oatmeal Crisp Lager wasn't available but the first I had my eye on. The Hatch Chile Gatos was one beer that stood out with me with its chile aroma and spicy finish that lingered for about 15 seconds. The Continual Soiree Scotch Ale had a distinct whiskey flavor, but with an ABV 9.0 it'll hit you pretty hard.  For food, we snacked on some spin dip and a Grape Escape Pizza which had a nice combination of sweet and sour with the grapes, goat cheese, and balsamic glaze. With the wide selection of beers, they could help out the customers by suggesting suitable pairings for the food on the menu.  The bartenders were super cool and gave some good recommendations. By the time we left, the brewery was almost at capacity with the lunch crowd and they still managed everything pretty well. With three flights, two more pints, and food the total for the bill pre tip was $54. This was a very worthy first stop for the weekend and with an ever changing small batch brew list, I wouldn't hesitate to return to try other things McFate has in store for beer drinkers.",

Maybe the best french fries I've ever tasted.  5 stars  Night 2.  Same great atmosphere. Beer still good.  if I could get some service to see how the other food was..I'd be positing about it..everyone else seemed to be enjoying theirs.  I literally sat there an hour, menu in hand.  Maybe a dozen words said to me the entire time.  \"Can I get you something to drink?\", \"Do you want another (insert same beer here)\"  ..uh it's a brewery and I would drink every one if given the chance and liver strength.  I think the other bartender said more to me than the one serving me.  I only got noticed (by the other bartender) after looking at the bill, paying for the beer with cash and leaving..I've NEVER done that.  1 stars..and if my 2nd grade math is correct..that makes an average of 3  I've worked food service, so I'm trying to empathize.  But I'm easy..give me beer and food and a fake smile then I'll be your best friend and tip better than most people.  I'm not sure where the problem was.. maybe just understaffed..get a bar back.  2 bartenders serving the entire restaurant and the bar and patio does seem a little thin..but no one else seemed to have a problem.  I'm sure the money I would have spent would have paid for at least a couple hours of their wages.  Maybe it's my resting beech face or maybe I looked too much like an ex that did them wrong.  Maybe if I had a t shirt that said 'Tip Jar' I'd get more attention.  And since I don't want to be 'that person'  I'm going to leave a few positive reviews on those that did me right.  Just fix it.  It's a great establishment and I don't want to have McDonalds and Bud Light for a night of dinner and drinks to celebrate",

They're rude and pissy. Nearly 24 hours since our last visit and I'm still mad about how rude the woman working last night was. While an elderly, frequent patron was drunk and sleeping sitting up right across from us (he legit appears to be an alcoholic they continue to serve) this girl behind the bar - who was not helping us at all last night - came over to my wife and I - who were not remotely intoxicated- and said she has to take our drinks away in a minute because they've closed and it's the law. Perhaps someone could have called out last call? Or the bartender helping us could have asked to close our tab? Or maybe if she had just been pleasant instead of bitchy and confrontational... endless possibilities for handling that with better customer service, let alone human interaction.  This place has pretty good food and we enjoy their personal beer selection but I can get that else where. Staff can make or break a location and I'm deeply disappointed in McFate's. We've taken lots of family and friends here, but I think our next get together will be at Goldwater or Scottsdale Beer Company instead.",

Tried the poutine, guac, and pretzels for apps - all three were yum, but the poutine was definitely the star with the delicious gravy and cheese curds.  Of course I had to try a burger...wish it had a slightly larger patty to keep up with the size of the bun, but definitely tasty and I would order again!  Hubby had pizza which he enjoyed and the others in the group had tacos and sandwiches. We were all stuffed and happy as we headed home.",

Bavarian pretzel came out warm. Dough has a slight sweet flavor which paired well with the spicy mustard. The cheese sauce was bland, so it sat largely in its bowl.     The hummus and Harissa came with pita and veggies. The hummus was good. We expected a kick from the harissa, but it too, lacked flavor. I added Tabasco sauce to spice it up a notch.  To round out our meal, we ordered the salad with grapes. We ordered with dressing on the side, but salads came out fully dressed. The salad was good; mixed greens, chopped nuts and grapes, but a little too soggy with the dressing.  The service also needs a pick me up. Maybe because we were above the average age (the places was mainly 20-mid 30s) we were largely ignored. When the server paid attention, he was nice, but getting his attention wasn't easy and the order not correct.",

    "text": "Wow! There truly are not enough words to describe the experience my friend and I had last night at this McFate's. I've heard so many great things about it. We've both been to the location on Shea and loved it. Since we were closer to this one after going to a play, we decided to stop in and get the churro pretzel. My friend also wanted to get a growler. We walked in at about 8:50 pm.   We were seated immediately, but that's where the good ends. The server we had could not have been more incompetent if she tried and I think was in part due to the management (whom we never met despite all of the problems). First she came over, asked for drink orders, got my friend's and forgot to get mine. This was never gotten, by the way. Then, we told her we wanted the churro pretzel to which she asked if we wanted one or two and she walked away to place the order.   After a good amount of time waiting a guy walks to the table with regular salted pretzels. We informed him that this was not what we ordered and explained expressly what we did ask for. He proceeds to tell us that that is not on their menu at this location, only at the Shea location. We were perplexed why we had been waiting about 15 minutes for something they don't carry. He gave is other options, but that was one of the reasons we went there, so no thank you. Then my friend was pondering her growler and waiting for our server to return, our server appears with a plate of pretzels. Our hope is that they were the same one as before, we actually questioned this. The kicker was when we said we wanted the churro pretzel her response was \"Yeah, I heard you say that before, but I didn't know what that meant.\" So, instead of asking us, the manager, a coworker, you just place any old order and assume we'll take it?  At this point, my friend and I are set to go to the other McFate's, but she needs to order her growler. So, she orders her large growler and asks for the check. We wait another 15 minutes in which time a small growler is placed on the table by another server. When she returns with the bill she goes \"Wait, didn't you order the large?\", walks away and comes back to say \"I must have put it in wrong, I'll get the right one.\" She came back briefly to inform us that the manager was only going to charge my friend for the small. No, acknowledgement, no apology, no manager even coming to the table after all of these errors? But they didn't stop there.   After 20 more minutes of waiting, I caught a server walking by our table's attention and told her we were waiting on the growler. She immediately walked away and brought it back. A good manager would have offered a better visit next time come and talked to us, no he stayed hidden. I should mention that we never had our server come back to our table and she never once apologized for all of issues. My money is not owed to anyone and if this is the service we get by a lame manager and incompetent servers, we will either keep our money to the Shea location or another establishment all together. It should be mentioned that this whole process took so long that it was well after 10 by the time we got to the Shea location and neither of us wanted the pretzel anymore. It would take a lot to make up for this terrible first visit.",

    "text": "Very nice brewery with interesting craft beers. We tired the hatch chile gatos and orangedale sour. Loved them both. Very unique flavor and I'm not a beer guru by any means.   Happy hour was nice, with discount for beer and food. Pretty good food in general. Hummus app was good enough  and they gave us extra veggies for dipping. We ordered the bison pasta dish and it was a nice heart plate. The grape goat cheese pizza was a bit on the sweet side. Even though it wasn't wood fired it was crispy all the way through.   Liked the outdoor and indoor feel of the bar area. Inside/outside bar pretty cool. Two Little fire places out in the patio. Fake grass area over on one side with a cornhole  game to entertain yourself.  High tops and low tables all around.",

When we first walked in the girl at the front acted like we we're an inconvenience with a massive sigh she lead us to our table ..then we waited for at least 10 mins to have anyone come ask if we wanted anything to drink. Our server was nice but noone told him we were his table so he didn't come take our food order for another 10 minutes .. food was good for the most part but when your service sucks it doesn't matter.

I was expecting it to be a lot more crowded than it was since their was a lot of hype around it, but it really wasn't all that bad. Granted it was about 4 o'clock on a weekday & it was getting ready to storm. I live close by and I've driven by since and it's looked packed.  Anyway, I tried both the Summer Session IPA & the Hefeweizen. I liked the IPA. Was tasty and not too hoppy. Our waiter recommended the Fate-Ality IPA (which is a lot more hoppy than the one I tried), but I figured I'd save that for the next time. The hef was good, but wasn't one of my favorites. Compared to other breweries that I've tried hef's from this one just didn't have quite as much of a distinct flavor to it.  I wasn't planning on trying any food, but my friend ordered a pizza (gluten free) & I tried a couple slices. It was really good! I can't remember exactly which one we had, but it a was a veggie one (since my friend is vegetarian). In fact, the menu looked really good, and there's a lot more food I'd eventually like to try.  I hope this place does well and I'll be back!",

We we greeted by a great server who kept samples coming of beers he thought we'd like (thanks Jordan!) and awesome recommendations. So...service...A+  The food was really tasty, especially for a chill pub food vibes kinda place. The Chicken Sandwich thats battered in buttermilk with poutine was delicious...and my girlfriends pizza was The Jess and was very thin crust with A LOT of goat cheese and roasted garlic. Very delicious.  The beers were first class all the way. Juicy, gushing Pale Ales, classic west coast IPAs and some insanely unique brews...like cinnamon rice milk beers or beers infused with spicy peppers. They all hit the mark.  Great place!",

A couple of weeks ago we went to the North location and found it closed, even though the website and phone message said they were open at 11 on Sunday.  I sent a note to them and the same day got a reply back with an apology and offer to comp us at the Scottsdale location Great customer service from them and shows that they really care about their clientele.  The food was excellent, salmon florentine Benedict was perfect, the house made Hollandaise and salsa were tasty and fresh, the Hatch Chile Gatos beer was a great compliment, and the server, was a lovely fresh and beautiful face.  Overall everything could not have been better. Potatoes were yummy too! Hugo took good care of us and I know Mc Fate will be one of our regular places. And even though our breakfast was a gift, we tipped well!",

I had my fair share of them and a Pale as well to accompany it. The smoothness of these ales have really spoiled me and makes it difficult for me to want one anywhere else! If you're a hop-head, you need to test these out!  I tried the pizza with the grapes on it and it's just delightful. On top of the greatness of all the OG pizzas, they throw this bad boy in the mix! I got to taste the jalapeno burger and the tots as well and I'm so excited to text out what else is coming out of the kitchen. Tasty!  As for the building and the brew house, I'm so pumped for Fate. The building is huge to incorporate a lot more people, a huge brew house, and even a barrel-aging room. Everything is modern but still gives you that bar-next-door feel which is a hard task to accomplish.  You'll catch me and all of my friends at Fate South and I promise it will not disappoint.",

The bartender was miserable to see us and not friendly or helpful at all.  She gave us a couple of menus that looked like they were pulled out of the trash without a smile or kind word.  We ordered two flights with a little of everything.  Every beer looked the same, smelled the same, and damn near had the same color and taste.  I'm not sure what happened.  I've heard great things about this place.    The building was nice, and the patio was pretty cool looking.  However, the bartender and the beers we had were all bad.  Maybe if they could get a friendlier bartender they could recommend better beers they offer?  Then again, if 6 of the beers we tried were not very good why would she serve them to begin with?    There are many questions I could ask but we hurried up and paid and got out of there as we clearly weren't wanted and after the flights and service the feeling was mutual.  Won't come back or recommend at this point.",

    "text": "McFate is arguably one of my favorite places to spend your nights as a beer nerd or  as someone who ejoys supporting a local business.  The atmosphere is bright and takes notes from Chipotle and is nice but slightly forgettable which is a sin but not a pro. Honestly this is the only sin this place may commit so get ready for all the positives.  First thing is the beer: they have an amazing rotation and there is always awesome beers on tap and everyone should have something to drink here.   Next: the food is absolutely awesome. I get pizza every time and it's just the right amount to share or have by yourself. It's about 14\" and is really solid. Pro tip: get the artichoke dip and ask for bread instead of the standard chips.   Finally, the staff is worth their weight in gold. I've never had a bad experience with the staff and they care about beer being served here. Jessica absolutely amazing so if you get her and you have a bad experience, it's probably you.   This is an awesome establishment and you should visit. Now. Like literally now. Go.",

We came for lunch today, the day after their grand opening and had a great time.   The building is super cool and really pretty and the space was very open. The were only moderately busy, it wasn't bad at all. I got the Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale which I really liked, and I ordered the Garlic Burger with fries. Our food came out in a decent amount of time and everything tasted great, the burger was juicy and cooked just right, fries were really good as well.   I was close to giving 5 stars but there were just a few small things I would improve upon. I wasn't really sure which side was the main entrance, so we walked in through the doors in the back by the Plato's Closet side. It was a little confusing because that takes you kind of in the back. There is a sign pointing towards other doors to tell you where to go to get seated but when we walked through and were still a little unsure where to go. We wandered a little and finally found our way up to the hostess area.   I would also maybe add a tad bit more variety to the menu. The main options are burgers, pizza, sandwiches and salads. I'd like to see maybe a good mac and cheese or pasta dish,or  some kind of chicken strips... something like that. Not that simplicity is a bad thing. I enjoyed our lunch and will definitely be back, looking forward to trying out some of the appetizers and happy hour specials! :)",

The bar is a huge cement square and there is plenty of seating.  We were there on Thursday night the week it opened, and there were very few tables open and only two bar stools open.  Our bartender, Cheryl, was very nice and introduced herself and asked our names.  She was quick to take our drink and food orders and was very friendly.  We ordered a pizza and the fish sandwich to share.  The fish sandwich was a little bland.  I think the fish needed more seasoning or maybe they could beer batter it for more flavor.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the tarter sauce that came with it.  The pizza was good, but pretty greasy.  The beer was fantastic and I can't wait until all those taps are full with more selections!",

I'm not one for long reviews, so here are a few highlights:  1) Amazing beer (yes, their beer up North has always been great). (I had Fate*Ality IPA and an Export Stout and my wife had the Oh My Gatos! Golden Ale). 2) Expanded appetizer menu: We started with pretzels - they always go over well with my family.  Now they have fries and tots - both were hot and tasty. The folks at the next table had sweet potato fries that they said were \"top notch.\" 3) Expanded dinner menu:  I stuck with my favorite pizza in town and had a \"Jess.\"  My nieces ate a pepperoni (they are picky...all gone).  The addition is sandwiches and burgers.  My daughter ate a Fate Burger and loved it.  Next time I visit I'm going to give the veggie burger a try. I also saw some salmon go by on a salad that looked good.  So...if you're looking for some place new with great food and beer...I'd give the new Fate a visit. The staff is friendly, the beer is yummy, and the food is tasty.  P.s. I can't wait for cooler nights on the patio!",

With a very spacious interior and wide open concept, it's clear that Fate takes its brand image just as seriously as its beer.  First visit was on a Wednesday night. There were plenty of guests, but it was not \"busy\" or \"packed\" by any means. There is quite a lot of indoor and outdoor seating, which is great - you'll probably never get that packed-in-like-sardines feeling here.  The aesthetic and ambiance is very pleasant, very krafty, very clean and very modern. Plenty of wood and metal elements ground the aesthetic as decidedly modern industrial, which I love. Tables are made to look like butcher block, which is also fun.  Service was ok. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. My friend ordered the sweet potato fries, but apart from that, we only stayed long enough for one beer a piece (long day, needed sleep more than alcohol).  I'll definitely be back to try some of the food offerings and the beer was yummy enough to persuade me back for more. If you haven't been, give it a shot - I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Grab a shirt while you're there, too - they've got plenty of merch.  ;)",

It's just a little more expensive, but that's South Scottsdale.",

He had the prime rib French dip with tots and it was phenomenal!  My Farm salad was amazing. No need to add any protein to it~the champagne vinaigrette was superb. Service was friendly and spot on.

I've really enjoyed their menu - buffalo chicken wrap, poutine, pablo honey flatbread.   Things that could use improvement: beer rotations (they seem to have most of the same beers every 2-4 weeks when we go), wait staff are hit or miss (sometimes they're great and other times we have been unimpressed).",

We ended up here on a busy Saturday night and while all the food and friendliness was totally on par, we had to wait what seemed like ages for our beers to come out. There were two gals serving the area we were seated, and a few in our group actually had to go up to the bar to order because our drinks never showed up. But I'm still leaving the four stars here because I have high hopes for McFate, and believe it was maybe just a really busy evening, or the gals were really new and I believe that what they lacked in service they make up for everywhere else. And definitely order the pizza.",

I came in 12:00 PM on a Wednesday and was sat immediately allowed to pick any patio table I wanted. Waters were dropped to my table by someone who was not my server so I could look over my menu (Great!) Then another person came over about 10 minutes later and took my drink order, still no greet from my server.  When my drink was dropped off I mentioned I was ready to order and someone else (who wasn't my server) took my order.  Food finally was dropped and a girl with red hair approached with no smile and very nonchalant to check on the food which I assumed was our sever. Food and drinks were good but our server never mentioned her name nor even an acknowledgement and really didn't do anything to earn our tip. I would have much rather given it to the girl who was actually taking care of us.  I'll give this place another chance, but our server really needs some better training.",

We came here for lunch just passing through South Scottsdale and had our dog with us (unplanned) so we had to sit outside. Fate has a huge open patio area that is dog friendly but when it's triple digits outside, it's not really the best option. We were greeted right away by our waitress (didn't catch her name) and she was quick and responsive with our drink and food order. We had the buffalo chicken wrap and the fish sandwich which was delicious. The teamwork at this establishment is excellent. Another employee came out and brought our dog a bowl of water. Then the bartender came out and delivered our beer. Then our kind waitress even turned on the misters for us and made sure we were comfortable and had what we need. It was nice to see the camaraderie between the staff and having others cater to us even when they were not our server. Thanks for an enjoyable lunch!",

    "text": "\"Ah, beer. The cause of and the solution to all of life's problems.\"  Homer Simpson  I went on Yelp and used their Waitlist Skip/No Wait thing to sneak my way ahead of the list.  I saw a lot of surprised faces from those waiting for a table.  Haha, it pays to Yelp, y'all!   The beers and food are pretty fabulous.  Pair that with an open and airy floor concept and you have a winner!  The Twist of Fate [bavarian pretzel(s), house made beer cheese, spicy mustard] was delicious.  It was warm and toasty and while that spicy mustard is super in your face, the real winner is the beer cheese.  I used that for my fries too.  Yum!  I also had The Truff Diver, don't be dirty folks, pizza [olive oil, mozzarella, mushroom, parmesan, cracked egg, fresh arugula, white truffle oil].  It is a peppery arugula explosion that pairs perfectly with the salty Parmesan and earthy mushrooms.  I wish the egg was more runny but whatever.  The flavors melded so well together.  The Reuben sandwich is also respectable and buttery. I enjoyed how the sauerkraut wasn't overwhelming and anytime I can get a perfect toast on rye bread makes me happy.  The two of us had a beer flight each for $6.  We did the Pick Three and I knew I had to get the Hatch Chile Gatos for Todd R.  If he likes it, I'm sure I will too --- and I did!  I guess the guy really knows his beer as much as it kills me to admit. ;) I also had the Oatmeal Crisp and the El Ultimo Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout.  The Oatmeal Crisp wasn't anything crazy but the El Ultimo Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout was bomb.  It drank like a meal and was insanely heavy.  I can't imagine drinking a full glass of this.  Give me the El Ultimo Mexican Hot Chocolate Stout and the Hatch Chile Gatos every day! I need to go back and try the Fruity McPunch and the McFate Strawberry Milkshake Wheat.   TL;DR I'm a fan for sure and I recommend this place to everyone!",

The space is HUGE, spacious and beautiful. You can walk in through the front, or, you're even invited to pass the barrel room and the brewing space by coming in the side door. I love to walk that route and see what the awesome brewer is cooking up next for us :)   Fate's owner Steve is a huge supporter of the craft beer scene here in the valley so its no surprise that they were recently named one of the best beer bars in America. As a result, Fate threw a fan appreciation event on Saturday, which was my most recent (of many) visits here. Even though the place was packed with wall to wall folks and standing-room only, the staff was all smiles and was working quickly and diligently to keep the beer flowing and the bellies full. They really did a great job and I know my friends and I loved trying so many of their offerings for only $3 on that day.   The menu is awesome here, a full kitchen offers more variety but also more chances to miss the mark - Fate South does not make that mistake though. I usually get one of their awesome salads or the chicken sandwich. But if you really want a treat, go for the pretzels and beer cheese. This is the kind of warm, salty, butter goodness that cheat days were created for! Hop you enjoy Fate as  much as I do, and check out the North location and their awesome pizzas!",

It is a great option for craft brew lovers and offers a more relaxing feel from the traditional Old Town bars.  Love the patio in the evening and the openness around the bar is very inviting.    The beer flight is a great way to try a lot of unique stouts, lagers, and IPA's for not much coin.  I was blown out of my chair to see one of their rotating crafts from my hometown of Bloomington, IL produced by Destihl Brewery on tap (what are the chances!).  Offering other unique small batch rotational beers from around the US is a very nice touch and keeps everything fresh!  Whether you need a change of pace or looking for a new favorite spot Fate is definitely worth a try!",

I had to ask for water three times and also sat for about 15mins before I was even approached. Now if he is working on the days I go I will sit at a table! If I were reviewing Garrett who even remembers you and what you like to drink then I would be giving them 5 stars! I do love the beers and my favorite salad is the grape w/ salmon, the dressing is delicious. Also the chicken club is really good!

The staff were all super and the owner even stopped by and visited.    Awesome!",

The only feedback I have is the brick fencing that separates the street peasants from the wealthy and rich made me feel uneasy(it's very poor and financially unstable looking)  It was either that or the girl crying over the microphone playing piano. All in all, I rate this joint 4 stars and may God have mercy on that poor piano players soul.",

We visited Fate Brewing from the recommendation of a local beer distributor we ran into at lunch in Old Town. He was right on the mark with a great brewery for atmosphere and refreshing beer!    We had a flight of 6 Fate Brews and a relaxing afternoon in the Patio. There is definitely a brew for everyone, though I was disappointed that the True experimental brews were either out of season or not Fate-brewed beer.   Didn't eat, but all the dishes around me made me sad I wasn't hungry enough to partake! Would definitely go back to taste more brews and food!",

I loved my burger, it wasn't like a big beef patty I could make rare but it still tasted good and I loved the sauce. My wife said she loved her salad, it wasn't drenched in sauce and didn't feel heavy. For pints I had the False promises IPA which I enjoyed strong but light going down and my wife had the fruity mcpunch which was pretty darn good. Nailed the taste they were going for. Also we loved how they were playing reggae while we enjoyed lunch.",

We also never got silverware or napkins. We then ordered another beer, and after 20 minutes, it never came.

    "text": "The first time I heard of Fate Brewery was maybe a year ago. Then I was introduced to Fate by some co-workers one day for lunch. Today, we were back for lunch and I realized how foolish I've been in neglecting (my) Fate.  I am speaking of the newer, southern location which opened last fall on Scottsdale Road just south of McDowell. Fate is the closest brewery to my home and I'm okay with that. Because of the handful of beers I've sampled, I am eager to bring friends along to try the others.  It looks as if the menu has been updated or expanded. My co-workers didn't remember having as many options from previous visits. Plus, the number of beer options has grown and changed (seasonally) which is always a good sign. Personally, I love seeing a brewery that also has a decent sampling of the competition. It's another beer celebration! And it shows the brewers confidence.  The only reason I didn't give Fate five stars, is due to my limited lunch visits. The food is so much better than common bar fare. My Fate Burger was simply amazing! However, lunch isn't the best way to judge a brewery for its atmosphere. I shall have to return one evening for a proper sampling of the beers I didn't get to try at lunch.  \"It's in your hands\" (says the bright red truck outside). Right now, I want a glass of Double Oat IPA in my hands! Salud!",

Service was efficient, and better than average.  I was in for beers and appetizers with some work colleagues earlier this week and we had a good time.  The beer was especially good and was the highlight for me.  We ordered some guacamole and chips and some poutine as appetizers.  The appetizers were good.  I would rate the poutine as a little sub par - but I am likely a tough grader for poutine.  Growing up in New England, we are pretty close to Quebec ... and no one does poutine better than the Quebecois.  Anyway, I would be happy to go back to McFate's anytime for more of their delicious beer and I am sure other solid items on their menu.  Cheers.",

    "text": "I had a rocky start my first time coming here, but this is really a great place that I will continue to come back to.  One of my favorite parts about McFate is their outdoor patio. My wife and I have a dog who has separation anxiety (well, maybe it's really us who have the separation anxiety, but that's beside the point) and the dog-friendly patio is great for all of us! The servers are always great at bringing out water for the dog also.   The \"rocky start\" I am referring to is the first time when my friend and I came here, our waiter forgot about us for a while. He had brought us water and then nothing for about 20 minutes. My friend and I were just hanging out and catching up, so it wasn't a huge deal, and when I finally walked over to him and asked for him to come help us, he was very apologetic and actually voluntarily brought his manager out because of the mistake. This really spoke well of the place to me because I could tell that they actually cared about their customer's experience and were willing to remedy the situation.   Their beer selection is also on point, and I really appreciate their creativity to make beers like the Strawberry Milkshake, along with some classic IPAs and others. Their flights are a good deal and a good way to try a few of their brews before selecting your favorite.   The food is also very tasty - definitely not just standard pub or brewery fare, they actually have great salads and sandwiches (I really enjoyed the Club with some tots).   I'm glad this is the closest brewery to where I live and will continue to come back here (especially for UofA games).",

The pretzel appetizer was really good - the crust was just the right amount of toughness - the inside soft  - good flavor.  Both the beer/cheese and the spicy mustard dipping sauces were good.  Ordered the Fire Burger - meh.  First of all - it's a 'smashed' burger, which apparently means it can only be cooked to within an inch of its life (well done) - ruins the taste of the beef.  (I tried to order it medium rare - no go).  The jalapenos were the only taste beside the onion and salt.  Kind of like a Five Guys burger, only less so.  Sweet potato fries were good.  It'd be at least 4 stars if not for the disappointment that was called \"Fire Burger\". Might try it again and order something else?",

The food was absolutely horrendous. I had a burger and literally only could have 3 bites before I lost my appetite. I ordered it med-rare, and it came out well done. Absolutely no flavor. Wasn't even seasoned, it's amazing what something as simple as salt and pepper can do to poor quality ground meat! What's amazing to me is that there was so much grease left in a party that you killed it on the flat top! The bottom bun wasn't toasted at all so it was completely soggy and unable to be picked up. I got a side of \"poutine fries\" and couldn't believe what came out. Shoestring fries that had been sitting under a heat lamp for at least 30 min. The cheese and bacon looked like it was cut by Helen Keller and a nasty red onion \"sauce\" that Definitely is not gravy. Maybe I'm a little over critical because I've been in the culinary field for 20 years but your execution of something as simple as a burger was pathetic. It's really a shame that such great beer has to be paired with such nasty food!",

Bland and a little dry. They burnt my date's pizza a little bit as well, and it too was fairly bland and unsavory. They took a long time to get me the beer I ordered, and I could tell it had been sitting on the bar waiting for some time, so it wasn't really that cold.   We did wait a little while for service, though nothing out of the ordinary for a place this busy.   Mostly the food is just forgettable and disappointing.",

All the bartenders were great I was checked on regularly and they knew their beers.  Speaking of beer I came here to specifically try their Fatality IPA. A colleague talked this beer up and had me drooling. At 100 plus IBUs you would think it would be bitter but I found it to be rather smooth. It has a kick so be careful. Dinner was perfectly battered fish sandwich with a side of salted sweet fries. Seeing this locale is about 10 minutes from my house I'll be back to try their other beers and experience their great service. An easy 5-star review.",

The beer is also great, Fate Brewing Company's IPAS have never let me down, and I'm guessing their other beers are equally good. I appreciate that there is ample seating both inside and out. The outside seating is dog friendly and inside had enough TVs for everyone to catch the DBacks game. The only issues I've ever had at Fate is occasionally service at the bar is a little slow and that sometimes TVs aren't set to local sports when games are being aired. Other than that Fate Brewing Company has good food, good beer, friendly staff, and a good atmosphere, highly recommended!",

The chairs are absolutely awful here, if the food wasn't as great as it is I wouldn't come here because the chairs are that awful.  Now the good! The appetizers are all great, especially the beer battered chicken. The chicken may be the most consistent menu item I've ever gotten from any restaurant. Every time I've gotten them they're crispy and juicy, seriously these are the best chicken tenders I've ever had by a mile! The beer selection is solid too and always interesting.  On my last visit, which was on 3/1/2018, I left my hat at my table and a hostess ran out to bring it to me. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name (she is short with box braids, so management if she sounds familiar please give her props) but I really appreciated her coming out to give it to me. McFate is my favorite brewery in the sea of breweries in the valley!",

I had customers in town for meetings this past week and it's darn near impossible to find a place that will accommodate large parties for dinner this time of year. I gave McFate's a call hoping they'd have room and they did! Well, turns out a few more showed up than expected, and though we had the largest table in the restaurant, they moved us to their private dining area to accommodate all of us. I can't thank the management enough for approving this move!  The waiter did an amazing job keeping all of our separate tabs - despite the move - and the food was wonderful! I highly recommend you try this place, you won't be disappointed!",

Being that it was a brisk evening we opted for the warmth of the indoors near to the bar area.   My immediate reaction to the bar was \"what's that stench?\" - the musty smell of the washing machine on the other side of the bar was almost unbearable. The intermittent steamy facials from the dishwasher were also not so delightful.  Their three samples for $6 was quite the steal and the selection of beer alone is worth the stop. Craison (a cranberry saison -whaaat!) was different and kind of delicious. Hands down favorite of the night was the Hatch Chile Gatos beer. I'm a sucker for anything that has a little heat to it. It's not spicy, but does have a little kick on the back end. Don't be shy and try a glass!   The man and I shared a burger and the spinach dip, which hit the spot. I just really wish they'd get that dishwasher issue fixed. The smell was just ick. And when a large part of beer tasting involves smell, it really kind of messed it up for me!",

It was pretty hard to choose, as they must of had 20 different beers.  The staff made some recommendations or at least was able to describe what the beers tasted like. My favorites were the Craison (cranberry sour), a triple oatmeal IPA, a session IPA, and a gingerbread stout.  Boy that oatmeal IPA was smooth!  You could barely tell it was a triple IPA.",

My complaint about this place is more of a personal issue. We have been there roughly 25 times this year and about the same last year. At one time, we went almost every Sunday. You'd think we'd be somewhat recognizable by now. But every single time, even when we have the same servers, we get asked \"so..welcome...have you guys been here before?\" YES...we have! I don't expect to have trumpets sounding and angels singing hymns but man, it'd be nice to know that someone on the service staff actually remembered us after about 50 visits.  That's it. Of course we'll be back...It's one of my favorite places to be invisible I guess.",

They have the styles of beer  I like but they just aren't that great, and they are sort of expensive @ 5 bucks a pint also they do not have pitchers:(. The food was trying too hard to be fancy and I didn't care for it, had some fancy pizza thing and it wasn't really that great. Three stars, I'll give it a shot again, maybe try something else on the menu..",

Of course this weather is perfect for dining on the patio near the fire feature. I love the green area!    Great selection of brews - the hatch chili beer is our favorite, but alas seasonal!  The appetizers are good - I'm addicted to Poutine!! I am a fan of their garlic burger and sweet potato fries. Their grilled cheese is nice, but missing some accent such as tomatoes or mild green chili. They have a private room in the back where we will be biking a dining club meeting. The staff is friendly and attentive.   Definitely a new favorite!!",

The outside seating area is amazing when the weather is nice, and the whole inside opens up to create a really nice open feel.  The menu was very straight forward...apps, salads, pizzas, sandwiches and burgers.  We ordered the fish sandwich and the California club. The California club was amazing! It was huge, and had a nice amount of fresh grilled chicken. The fish sandwich wasn't bad, but it was a little dry--I loved the sides, but i would order something else next time.  Seemed like they don't have a full bar, and i didn't see their wine list this visit, so I'm not sure it exists. I'd definitely try this place again, especially when looking for a place to enjoy a gorgeous day out.",

    "text": "Two visits this month and more to come. Really enjoy this place.  Atmosphere - Great time to visit the South location because it is an indoor/outdoor location. A combination of an outdoor patio vibe, large bar and indoor seating. I really like the large concrete indoor/outdoor bar where I've made my perch on both visits. The only drawback is the proximity to Scottsdale Road, which can make a little noisy when the Harley Davidson weekend warriors go by.  Service - I'm indifferent about it, because that is how they treat the guests. They are attentive and manage the orders well, but their attitudes are, well, not very friendly. They aren't rude but they can lighten up and be a little nicer to the patrons. Again, I've sat at the bar both times so that is directed to the bar staff.  Beer - They brew so really really good beer. It is innovative and I've been working my way through their menu. I also like their guest taps which include other locals like the Huss Brewing Magic In The Ivy Ale.   Food - Beside their beer the bites will bring you back. Before I go over the items we ordered I'm going to give a thumbs up to one of the side dishes, tater tots. Best I've had in a long time and one of the reasons I came back. Roasted Garlic Burger - Great execution, good flavor but my only reason not to order again was the mushrooms. I would have preferred them to be caramelized and warm, I didn't like their cool temp. Grilled Cheese Please - Hard to find a grilled cheese with Muenster on it but this place has it. Added bacon and it is a killer sandwich. Ribeye Steak Sandwich - Love it on the Ciabatta bread. The steak was tender and love the char.   There is a lot on the menu and I look forward to trying more of menu, and a few beers also.",

    "text": "Wow. Just yum! We left still thinking about our orders!  my husband and I tried the sausage pizza & chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries. He had the grape of throne & the pale down unda and I had the Irish red. The fries were lightly salted, the size was perfect - not shoe string or wedges and just the right amount of soft crunch. The club sandwich is what took the spotlight! The chicken was juicy and no condiments were needed at all. It wasn't a big chunk of meat - it was thin grilled just perfectly. The sourdough bread was toasted and buttered just right, nice & golden and soft yet, toasty. The bread soaked up the delicious chicken juices but still kept the buttery edges the right amount of crunch. The pizza had a delicious and generous red sauce that had a smalllll hint of sweetness but still a good salty paired with the spicy sausage. We ordered wings to go too! Can't wait to come back and try something else although we feel the sandwich is worth being a regular order.  Portions are decent for the price too.  :)",

Being new to the area he spent a little extra time with us recommending places for us to go and see. The burgers were great. I recommend the Garlic Burger. The atmosphere is what really buts this brewery above the rest. My husband enjoys craft beer better than I do, but after hearing so much about the Candy Bar Stout I went for it. It is a very smooth stout with an excellent taste. It is definitely a must try!",

But South's food is basic - I feel like I could get the same in the frozen section at Costco - and the service is horrendous. We waited over 15 minutes for a server to even say hello, our glasses were constantly empty, waited 15 to get a check with empty plates/glasses, and another 10 minutes for the waiter to even pick up the check to run our cards. Luckily, we spoke with the manager and he was very nice and apologized. I doubt we will be going back to Fate South very often. I'd much prefer North, even though it's much farther for us and smaller.",

Came here for a drink on Saturday night and it was busy, but not over crowded. I love the Candy Bar Milk Stout we ordered that and the Fatalitality super hoppy IPA. Very good beer. I didn't Oder any food but on my next trip I will. I'll definitely be back to this location when I'm back in the area.",

    "text": "What a great new addition to the neighborhood! Although I am bias as I love good beer as you see from my other reviews.  They have a great space situated near Scottsdale and McDowell.  They have a great indoor area with a big bar and plenty of big tables with views into the tank room and tvs.  Then the bar extends out to the great patio with a bunch of seating and a \"grass\" area for bags and other games.  Food is really good I have tried several items all were good but especially their burgers.  Beer list is always in rotation and there is a new beer of theirs almost every time I go so unlike other brewers in town that might have a seasonal they are really brewing different stuff all the time. They also get creative, and although some are not to my taste, some are home runs, and as a beer nerd its about the craft and trying new things to broaden the pallet.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and I have had some really go times due to the server are bar tender going the extra mile or nerding out talking beer.  As I mentioned I have been there multiple times from day one as I live in the neighborhood, the reasoning behind the 5 star rating which I don't give lightly is as follows.  They have a good atmosphere, and they cater to the area they are in, while providing a great experience and food.  I took a group of 18 for my birthday where they really took the time to go above and beyond. I even asked for a quick sneak peek tour, and they not only did that but went one step further.  They did a small sampling of an upcoming brew which was a great birthday gift and a fun behind the scene experience for the couple friends that joined me.  The reason they received that 5th star mainly hinges on the passionate staff and the highly involved owner. I don't judge a business on how they handle things when they go right but on how they handle things when they go wrong and that's whats for a good restaurant I can recommend to friends, family and fellow yelpers.  As we had a few speed bumps my first visit (opening day), they responded to my comments and went above an beyond, to make the experience for everyone a great one ever since.  Thank you and Cheers!",

Poutine fries - interesting and delicious.  The Grape Escape pizza - different and mouthwatering.  The Burger - mixture of brisket and hamburger - delicious.  The buns were even irresistible!  This was our first visit and we WILL be back : )",

For only $10 you get an hour long yoga class in the Barrel Room AND a beer at the bar afterwards. Yoga and booze, two of my favorite things! Seriously, I live in HAWAII and I try to make it to this class every single time I am back in PHX, it's just that awesome. The instructor leads a kick-a$$ yoga class that will get you sweaty, loose, and THIRSTY. Hang on to your receipt and present at the bar for your free beer! They're always brewing something new and the bartenders are knowledgable about their product. We always manage to work up an appetite and their appetizer selection in great.  So get your girls (or your guys!) and a good 'ol Alexander Hamilton, and start your Sunday Funday off right!!",

We were driving down Scottsdale Rd and ran into Fate. They have an excellent assortment of house beers and guest beers from breweries ranging from California to Michigan. My personal favorite is their Fate-ality IPA, whose hoppy strength rivals that of the SD IPAs I've been accustomed to. Their pita & hummus dish is also a pretty good pairing with a beer flight.   So aside from the beer, food and location, the reason for 5 stars? MUSIC CHOICE! They had reggae playing the entire time which is a rare experience at an AZ brewery! Had me feeling totally at home being from So Cal. I can't wait to return and try more of their beer in such a nice ambience!",

    "text": "Beer Cheers to Andrew \"Dude\" C. leader of the UYE Brews Cruise for coordinating the meet up at Fate Brewing Company, for without him I don't know if fate alone would have brought me here. I started our brews cruise with the Oh my Gatos Hatch Chile Cream Ale, it had a light aroma and flavor of green chili without the heat. I'm an AZ gal and could've handled some heat but it was still the group's and my favorite!    I continued the cruise by tasting my friend's Fate-Ality IPA which claims to have an irresponsible amount of hops and does not disappoint,  if hops is your thing this brew is for you...but any more for me and I would have been sunk!    But why stop there I had to keep the beer theme flowing, so I ordered the BBC starter, beer battered chicken and sweet potato fries on the side. It was enough to keep me afloat with good flavor and plenty to share with the crew.    My brews cruise mates ordered the Grape Escape pizza and as always were kind enough to share. It was topped with garlic oil, mozzarella, roasted grapes, goat cheese, rosemary, balsamic glaze and caused me to have food envy, don't you hate it when that happens!? I'll be back to get one of my own!  As fate would have it, we ended the night there or it would have been Uber taking me home.  If you're into good brew and food, then cruise on over to Fate Brewing!  Happy Yelping and Eating! :) Cheers!  .",

Who cares it's 10$ do it! You have to try all of them even if you think you aren't going to like them, you won't find these sort of flavors anywhere else!   Secondly, I may have just gotten a Cesar salad but omg it was so good. You can taste the freshness in their house Cesar, and even the freshness of the chicken I added to it.   There was a long wait when I was here about 7pm on a Friday night, but there was plenty of room at the bar, plus it was a great place to make new friends since I am not from the area. Which is always a plus.   So go here! Do it!",

It's the best of both worlds as they are literally a place we can hang with the dog and have a drink plus have a meal as well. This place rocks and we are so lucky they are so close to where we live!

I believe it also had goat cheese, fig jam, and prosciutto. Seriously, I think I need to reiterate how good it was. Yum :) We also had the fish sandwich, it was also really good but if I had to choose would definitely go with the pizza every time. We sat at the bar top as it was a little chilly but the outside patio is also very cute! Would potentially be a great place to come in the Spring time!

CONS -The 2nd beer I ordered had old lipstick on it -The food...I ordered the 3 eggs any style. I wanted the eggs poached but they said they cannot accommodate. I guess it really isn't any style. Ordered the potatoes well done, sadly they were not. The bacon became soggy from all  the green chili sauce. It was underwhelming, no seasoning and taste. Just an over all blah dish. I ate only 1/3 and gave the rest to my husband.   There was a lot going on, if we were not in such a large group and not crunched for time, I would have said something to the Server/Manager.",

    "text": "A group of four of us went on a Thur night for some drinks and food. This was the second time I've been here and really enjoyed it each time, even though this time the server wasn't the greatest or friendliest. I had the Legendary French Dip that was good, but would of liked more of a bite with the horseradish sauce. My friend had the Lunchbox Burger and really liked it. Our fries came out perfect. I'm still giving 5 stars because it was my friend's food that came out really late compared to all of ours and the fact that when they called management over they handled it well. After the managers got involved the server stopped coming over to our table for a while so another server stepped in and was very cheery, happy-go-lucky so it helped to turn the mood around. Throughout the night we also had asked one of the bussers, Danny, for assistance since our server wasn't available,  and each time he was more than happy to jump in and get us what we needed. Our server did eventually pop back up and had a more friendly approach for the remainder of the visit. In general, the staff is very friendly,  the food and drinks are very good and is a cool atmosphere to hang out!",

    "text": "\"Ho Ho Ho, McFaaaaaaaaaates was delicious!!\" Did you just say that in Santa's voice? I bet you did now!! First time here was today. I'm a bit disappointed in the service but the food made up for it ten fold. The place was jumpin when we arrived and we opted to sit at the bar outside. It appeared there was only one bartender running the entire bar, inside and out and he was buuuuuuusy, so I honestly cant blame him for the slow service. He clearly was not set up for success from his team. My hubby and I were not really in a rush and we were enjoying the ambiance. McFate has a dog friendly patio and there were lots of dogs today.  We started with the pretzels and beer cheese. I think I can say these were by far some of the best pretzels we've had. If pretzels and cheese are on a menu, I will 100% of the time order them; let's just say I've had a lot of pretzels haha. These were so soft and squishy, salty and delicious! The Beer Cheese was so good I had to ask for more! It also became a dip for my tots. Yeah...mind blown!  We shared the Lunch box burger with a side or tots. Talk about a childhood dream come True! It was Peanut butter, fig jam, cheese and bacon. Holy moly Batman, where has that been all my life? Peanut butter?? On a burger?? With cheese and bacon?? YES PLEASE!!! Nom, nom, nom it was so good I am now going to get peanut butter on all my burgers. Dude, no joke, its flippen good!!  All in all we had a great time, the weather was perfect the food amazing and the service was ok. We will be back for sure.",

A burger with mushrooms, garlic, and Swiss should taste like something. At least garlic. But, nope. nothing. They have a full bar . . . sort of. Don't expect the brands you love, you'll find the local flavor - so bonus star for that. I didn't enjoy my evening here. That being said, it appeared to be fairly popular - so perhaps the burger threw me off. Service? minus two stars. You'd think that bars make their money by bringing you drinks, but I was never asked if I needed another. I don't even know what happened to our server. Needless to say, I didn't stay very long.",

    "text": "Fate Brewery was recommended by a colleague and I started taking my family (wife and 10 yr old daughter) about a month ago. We were greeted and served by a very sweet and caring waitress named, Grace. Amazing Grace recommended some great beers and food selections.   Since then we have sampled a little of everything on the menu and now have been reordering our favorites. The Twist of Fate is a soft pretzel accompanied by a choice of an addictive mustard or the beer cheese sauce. Two of them for $10 is a great value and fills the three of us up nicely.   My wife and I enjoy a bitter, hoppy IPA. My wife orders the Fate Fateful and I enjoy the Fate Fatality. The pizzas and other apps are all very tasty and filling.   Amazing Grace recommended the Key Lime pie for dessert and since we had previously lived in South Carolina, we were very familiar with a good key lime pie. Well, we couldn't believe how good it was, better than the Carolina Key Lime pies I hate to say!  Last week, unfortunately we had a subpar dining experience. Having prior F&B management experience for over 20 years, I can be both forgiving and a little demanding as well. I made my feelings known to our male server, outlining all the things he missed serving us that evening and he sent over management to check on us.  I was blown away by the professionalism of the manager Pat Laughlin, who listened to our dining mishaps that night. He was friendly and genuine. His resolution will have us returning again and again.  Thank you Gracie and Pat for your paramount service.",

We also sampled flights of beers and enjoyed the pretzel appetizer (which came with the BEST mustard I have had with a pretzel appetizer EVER) and a yummy beer cheese sauce.  Then we had salads and pizzas, everything was very tasty and the beers were delicious.  I've been on quite a few brewery tours, small and big and enjoyed quite a few flight samplers at micro breweries.  The beers here are so distinct and full of FLAVOR.

We ordered a few beers and an appetizer to share and the food was also good. We noticed a pretty large party arriving and our poor server looked like he had the entire patio and this large party (20 people). I had to leave in about 20 minutes so I asked the server for my tab. About 5 minutes later I decided to grab another beer and my revised tab. I received my beer but no tab. 20 minutes later I flagged down the other server and asked for my tab and gave her my credit card. She brought it back to me and charged the entire bill on my card. I flagged our server down and said I just wanted my tab for my two drinks and he then said, \"well you should have said that then\" and walked off. I stood there in shock as I did say that the first and second time. Even my girlfriends said I said it (I was questioning if I didn't make myself clear) but his response threw me for a loop. I won't hold it against him as I know he was overwhelmed a bit by the large party as his service for us diminished quite a bit after they arrived. I will try this place again as I would like to try other food.",

First, there was a bar tender by the name of Isaac that was very nice and efficient; however the place was busy and he was not receiving help from the other bartender or manager. Then after we went to our table the waitresses were constantly interrupting our conversations to take our menus; seriously paper menus and you don't have enough?! Next, we needed to flag down wait staff to order additional drinks and we waited to get our bill. I do want to say the facility looked clean and was in our neighborhood, so we will probably go back. I feel that it was probably under staffed or the staff that was there was not working as a team. I hope it improves.",

The parking lot looked busy but there were lots of open tables. We got a patio seat immediately-the hostess was very friendly-and that was our last positive interaction. We sat and watched while tables who were sat after us were waited on and served drinks. All the while we sat staring at the several servers who seemed to be working the section where we were sitting. After 15 minutes I walked up to the bar and asked if I could just order a couple drinks and mentioned we hadn't been waited on. Instead of just allowing me to order at the bar, the bartender said she would send someone right over. She seemed concerned and apologetic. Unfortunately, we still sat another 10 minutes while EVEN MORE tables who were sat after us got served. Finally, just got up and left.  I had really enjoyed the Fate brews I had tried at several beer festivals, but after this interaction, I have no desire to even try this place again.",

Also, while I'm sure they are using the same recipes the pizzas seemed a little bit off from the original location.  Will come back and give them another chance but overall not to impressed with Fate South.  We also wonder if they have some sex fetish as both locations are located next to adult stores.",

    "text": "I live close to Fate and am thankful they are in our neighborhood, however walking by and dining here are two very different experiences. First, we ordered two gluten free pizzas and when they came out, one looked completely different then the other. The server said it was because of their size but the one looked maybe an inch smaller. I sent them both back (the one that actually looked gf had mushrooms which I didn't order). Then, someone else came out to apologize and said that the one was indeed not gf and they were sorry, and would buy our pizzas for us, very nice. They came back out and were pretty good. I do think it's terrible though that if I wouldn't have said something, I would have spent the night super sick. Also, we parked out daughter's tricycle inside the back door so we wouldn't need to mess with it or have it in anyone's way in the restaurant. She had a little lantern on her bike that we left as well. After we were done eating, someone had stolen the lantern. Crazy! The hostess who sat us also argued with me back and forth about how the grass on the lawn was real and not fake, even though we've rolled around and played in it many times. She wouldn't stop until she went over and felt that it was indeed plastic. Service was slow as well.",

We ate at the bar because it was the only place to go, and the service there was very friendly! Only thing that bothered me was being told an outrageous wait time for a table, then seeing lots of table sit empty for TOOOO long. I'm not a fan of places holding tons of reservations open for people who aren't THERE. People don't show up on time? Tables are GONE to others who ARE there.  We met a nice couple who was told 20 minutes. An hour later, with their baby...they were still waiting. That's not right. Seems like the \"getting people seated,\" is the only thing that I thought needed work. Loved the atmosphere and love having a fun place in South Scottsdale!  Will we go back? Absolutely.",

Before arriving here last night I had looked on their website. and didn't see any other drink options.  However the food menu looked good so I knew that I'd be in great hands!  Once I arrived to a packed, fun and busy environment, I was happy to see that they did indeed serve wine and cocktails!    I came here last night with a large party of 40 and they had reserved a great section for our group.  We weren't squished, there was plenty of room and the service was fabulous!  Kendyl was our server and she did a great job, food and drinks were constantly flowing on to the tables.  She also kept a tab for each individual person/group, which I know is difficult to do.  It was very handy at the end though when we didn't have to split a bill between everyone and go through the details of who owed what, etc; especially since some left earlier and later than others.  The drink prices are great, well...I just moved here from CA so to get a cocktail for $8 on a Friday night, is a score of a deal.  I'm too new to the area to know if that's low/high or not.   Everyone's food looked great!  Some got appetizers, sandwiches, pizzas and others just shared a few small bites.  I wasn't starving and seeing that we were in a casual atmosphere with everyone standing and watching the game on the tv's, I wanted an appetizer vs a main meal.  I decided to go for the hummus, as well let's just say I'm addicted to hummus :).  The pita that it came with was grilled to perfection and I was able to swap the celery for extra cucumber.  The plate also comes with harissa which I wasn't aware of what that was.  It's supposedly a spicy dip but it's bearable, not like eating Indian curry.  Towards the end of last year I'd come here for lunch and had the pretzels, which were amazing and a fabulous seafood dish.  Overall this is a casual spot to kick back and watch a game, while enjoying great food and drinks.  The place is clean, there is plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor and the service is excellent!  I will be back...",

It's a good sauce which I think was wasted on the base, Fair portion though missing curds/ If there's bacon in there it's really tiny.  The wings, they come out with  1/2 drums / 1/2 wings on opposite sides of the plate, are small - medium. The sauce was pleasant enough but not befitting the habanero name.    Not going to diss the beer this time,  really didn't like it and I should have gone with something I have more experience with.   All in all, blah  Their website is pitifully slow too:)",

We have been coming to this location in South Scottsdale 2-3x/month. What keeps us coming back is the consistently fabulous service, friendliness of every single person that works here and the quality of food and beer. I wish the menu would update, but we definitely like having our staples too, which are always delicious!  Kudos to you all for creating a place that is so great! See you soon.",

The building was nice and very welcoming inside. Great patio even though it was too hot to enjoy the day I was there.   I sat at the bar. The bartender was nice, friendly and attentive without bugging someone who was definitely just lounging to kill time.   I ordered a salad that was southwestern or something like that. It was incredible. I actually returned and had it again two days later. Very fresh. Refreshing in the heat. Filling with the grilled chicken added.   The beer was ok. This is why it only gets 4/5. The IPAs I had were basic, boring and not exciting. This might be because I'm from NorCal where our IPAs are amazing. Maybe this is the best in the area (and I admit I didn't have any better) but they are well below what I am used to. The best beer I had was a porter with coconut. Very good, but odd to drink when it's 110 degrees out.   I'll be back for sure and I recommend the place. If they could step up their IPA game I'd give it a 5/5 for sure.",

I ordered the hatch beer which had the essence of chili but no spice at all - something different and refreshing hence I couldn't help but order one more!  For food I ordered the hatch burger with black bean patty- no flavor at all. Not the party nor the sauce and definitely no spice! When I read chili aioli and green chilies I really wanted some flavor or spice but got nothing so couldn't eat it after a couple of bites, The fries were decent though.  Service-everything was fine until I received my bill with an extra beer added on it! The server changed it.  I would have given it a 4 or 4.5 for the beer but the food didn't make me happy at all hence the 3 stars.",

Large bar to sit and wait for a table if it's busy. We were told 30 minute wait and it ended up being 15.   Everyone who works there is excellent. Bartender always offered for us to taste the beer before we ordered a full glass. Waitress was attentive and friendly.   Four star review because the food is decent, I wouldn't go there just for it though. Beer and food wise nothing stood out, but nothing was bad. Street tacos we were told were spicy, we like spicy food but didn't pick up any spice at all. Fried chicken sandwich was okay. The chicken was fried very well but it was too thin, the Swiss cheese was also thick and unmelted and I couldn't pick up on the habanero mustard. Wings were good. Mac and cheese looked good, has real bacon on top of it.   We like this place, we'll be back because it's a great casual atmosphere to relax with friends and catch up.",

Open late, extended drink menu and dog friendly - sounds perfect.  We really enjoyed our time out on the large patio after dusk and the service was great. The food was really hit or miss though and seemed to be a bit heavy handy on the 'spicy' (mac n cheese, ahi salad, and aki bowl) but we were too busy swooning over all the fur babies in attendance to really care. Met our criteria for convenience and drink selection on this particular visit but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back, solid 3 stars.",

Their beers are always rotating and although I am not a fan of a lot of them, the ones I DO like are some of my favorite beers. There are two seasonal fruity beers (blueberry milkshake wheat and strawberry milkshake wheat) that are AMAZING. This evening I tried a lemonade radler that was just as good as my beloved milkshake beers. BF and I usually both order the buffalo chicken wrap (pro tip: ask for your chicken crispy instead of grilled). The pizzas are also very good. Try the Jess or the Sweet Sow. They are super dog friendly and we've never had anything short of a stellar experience with their staff. 10/10 would recommend",

I was the designated driver so like most times I ordered orange juice and usually bars usually give it to you for free when you're the guy who's keeping everyone safe. Otherwise they charge you $3 for a big glass.   I got my bill and realized I paid $3 each tiny little 6 ounce or so glasses of orange juice.  Not feeling it was worth my time to bother say anything, I gave the guy my card and paid the bill and gave only a 12% tip, to which I was verbally bashed by another waitress about my terrible tip. She insisted I was supposed to tip a minimum of 20% and that I should be happy to pay a whole bunch of money for orange juice.  I'm normally a good tipper when the service is commensurate with the tip...  Needless to say I won't go back here again.   I don't do drama or people demanding higher tips. Seriously having an argument over $2 more in tip is not only stupid but just annoying.",

Particularly in the pizza department.   I did not like the beer at all. My friend liked the guest tap she tried. She tried what I had, and said it tasted \"like dirty socks that someone threw their cigarette in.\"   The pizza was unbalanced. I was expecting salty and sweet from the grape pizza. Instead it was super sweet. My friend enjoyed the pretzels and beer cheese, though not the mustard. It was overwhelmingly pungent.   McFate's has more of a restaurant vibe, than brewery. We were looking for a place to have a bit to eat, enjoy a drink, and catch up with old friends. The establishment was not even close to busy, and yet we felt rushed. I am used to breweries that encourage you to sit and linger. Here I felt more like they were trying to get us to move on. The Ambiance is nice otherwise.",

The burgers are huge, good luck finishing it. I will definitely will be back soon.",

The interior was nice and brewery aspect of it was cool but the food really fell short. You can tell that this place was built primarily as a brewery and the food was an afterthought. It wasn't bad but just kind of Meh....The best way to put it is that in a town where $10 hamburgers are a dime a dozen this particular $10 hamburger would not be my first pick. Same applies with the pizza, I think I would have been equally satisfied with the $3 Red Barron Pizza in my Freezer. Everything lacked finesse and just seemed rather generic. My one suggestion which could really change my entire perception of his place is to hire a chef that knows what they are doing that can help elevate the menu and quality of food.",

The beer selection is great, their in-house brew selection spans from sours to ipa's to Hefeweizen. All good tasting.

I tried a flight because I couldn't decide. I was most impressed by the Hatch Chile Gatos, what a beer experience that was, all the flavor of Chile without the heat... and being from New Mexico anything with Chile is a must try. The beer is definitely more sharp compared to other breweries I've been too. They are delicious though. The bartenders could have been better. They all seemed to be in a bad mood, took about 15 minuets to get their attention to even order a beer and they weren't busy at all. All the food looked delicious too, I got guac and chips which was yummy, but people around me ordered some good looking food. I liked the atmosphere, part indoors and outdoors, great music, big television. Five out of five for the beer... 4 out of 5 for the service",

The majority of the tables seat four and are as high as the bar with heavy barstool-height seats that are hard to scoot in.  The place is brightly lit.  The beer is average.  The food is resaonably priced based on our one and only visit.  We got adequate but not good service.  Our waiter was all over the place and kept forgetting to bring things (like tableware, then napkins).  But that was just one visit.  It was crowded, but there was no wait.  I am sure most customers have had a better experience at Fate.  My sandwich was very good.  I ordered a Reuben.  It had just enough meat to be passable, and about three times the thickness of sauerkraut (usually it's about half and half).  But it tasted good and I'd get it again.  The beer was nothing special.  I wouldn't go there expecting a special brew.  My wife ordered a hot sausage pizza.  It was completely limp.  They say you can special order a thin crust pizza, which we didn't do.  But this thing was as limp as fully cooked pasta.  It tasted fine, but I didn't see much meat on it.  Frankly (and I don't mean to be gross), the meat looked like drippings of dark diarrhea, and there was hardly any on it.  I just don't think it's a good value when there are so many other brew places with great beer and food nearby.   Unless we get a great coupon, we won't be back.",

Chicken was not added to the pasta until server brought over a side of chicken in a cup/ bowl. Took a long time before server came to get order. It just seems like there was not enough help at first.   The worst part about it all was the flys. As soon as our food was brought out to us, we were attacked by flys. The server seemed irritated and told us we can move if we want but said they were everywhere. We eventually moved to another table. A manager never came to the table to talked to us and see if we were ok. It may have been just a bad time to come in. I just felt that someone should have apologized that we had to move and pick our own table.   The service was not good and the flys defiantly made the whole experience even worse.

Still have never had a better beer cheese and pretzel.   Just an all around fantastic spot to spend your time drinking incredible beer and delicious food.

We all tried the Easy A, the Double Oatmeal IPA, and the Standard Pale Ale all of which were absolutely terrible. None of the beers had any depth, body, or flavor. They all tasted and smelled like Pee. I will not be going back and I would recommend that nobody waste their time or palate.",

It seemed like whoever was supposed to be our waitress ended up being too busy so it was quite awhile before somebody got over to us and then took awhile to get our drinks.  My major complaint though was that we ordered appetizers, kids meals and an adult meal.  They brought out one kids meal right away. But then the rest of us sat there waiting, he was done eating by the time the rest of the food came. Then they brought our appetizers and all of our food all at once so we couldn't really enjoy the appetizers before the food got cold.  When people order appetizers those should be brought out, then the food started, not everything served at the same time and 15 minutes after one random kids meal was served.  We also ordered a 32oz growler and were brought a 64 oz instead.  That said, the food and beer were all really good, no complaints there. We might eat here again but make sure to order our appetizers first, then our food.",

This place is close enough where I can bike myself to which is always a plus in my books.  The place itself provides a open atmosphere and has somewhat of a under-construction look.  My buds and I sat at the high top tables and order their craft brews.  I ordered the Nelson Pale Ale; I'm not much of a beer drinker these days nor can I say I'm an expert when it comes to hops and sorts.  Needless to say, I love a beer where I can actually taste the difference between each other!    We started with appetizers and our server was quite helpful in making a decision.  I wasn't too hungry, but my buddy was so we ordered the Hummus & Harissa Plate and the Nachos.  The hummus was a house made garlic hummus and came with veggies and pita bread.  I thought this start was a delight and you can definitely taste the garlic!  Our nachos was huge and came with homemade chili, jalapenos, cilantro, sour cream and guacamole.  I regret not adding chicken to it; but overall and solid and probably one of my favorite nacho appetizer I've had in a long time.  Matter of fact I would say this is top 3 for sure!  We ended the night with dessert skipping entree since after the super awesome nacho we had nothing left!  We order the chocolate mousse with Oreo and whipped cream.  Again, what a pop to the senses!  Both smooth and creamy with a crunchy texture.  It was definitely appealing to the eye but also our appetite!  In the end McFate is definitely a must return for this Yelper, but also a great recommendation for beers, drinks, and great atmosphere! - Enjoy!",

Everything from layout and vibe to service and food quality was top notch - a definite spot to add to your Scottsdale list!  I went for a chicken club sandwich and a lager (I can't remember the name of it sorry) and both were fantastic. The bread for the chicken club particularly was to note as it was thick enough to hold all contents but not too heavy to make it hard to it - if you're a chicken club lover you'll understand.  Our server (again name gone) was brilliant as well, I don't remember having service that attentive before and I would never have expected it to come at a Brewing Company. But then again, he was an expert. He knew every single beer on the menu inside and out, he knew the flavours, the nodes, the colours and which beers matched which dishes.

This is one of those places where you need to try everything off the menu!!  Now for the drinks, Their Cucumber & Basil Bloody Mary is awesome!! its got some spice, so if you want mild tell them to dial it down, but I couldn't stop at just one. They have a fantastic hatch chili beer that is as smooth as silk that leaves a nice chili taste and a bit of spice on your tongue and their pilsner is spot on. They have some great craft cocktails and everyone I have ever been there with fins something they love.  Do yourself a favor and make the effort to stop in here, you won't be disappointed!",

Really enjoy sitting outside and the ability to bring my dogs too. Oh, and surprised that the Bloody Mary was so awesome too.",

I will say, the pretzel and beer cheese appetizer is extremely soft fluffy and tasty....but that's ALL I can compliment! The waitress was absent, when she DID come around she was overly cheeky. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and the damn thing was burned! The table next to me ordered the same sandwich and got the same result!!!! The chairs are solid hard wood, clearly intended to make the guest uncomfortable so they will order quickly, wolf down the food, and LEAVE!!! My husband and I will NEVER go back!!!!!",

So I decided to take advantage of this offer and hit up McFate's for lunch. I was by myself so I sat at the bar.  The bartender informed my of all the specials for the day and came back shortly to take my drink order. However, once he served me my drink, he never came back, not until he handed me the bill. I never had the chance to place my lunch order. I sat there for a while, but got fed up and decided to pay my bill and down my beer. He took my money, but never came back with the change or the receipt I needed in order to get the $5 discount at Plato's. I had to ask another bartender for my receipt.  Then I went shopping next door with a grumbling stomach. Their happy hour prices on food looked great, too bad I didn't get a chance to order any of it.",

Fate has something for everyone on their menu if pretzels and pizza aren't your thing (ya weirdo). The atmosphere and decor is pretty modern and the outdoor seating is bomb. Bring your dog!! Lastly, their to-go is really fast and packed nicely. Sometimes I pick it up if I don't feel like getting dressed and I'm trying to binge on Netflix. It's a perfect date night too! Can't go wrong with the beer either! Okay, I'm done.  Ps. I promise I don't work for them... Haha",

We ordered the Northeast Mode and ended up not finishing it.  The food on the other hand was FABULOUS!  Ordered the pretzels for our appetizer and they were gone in no time!  If we didn't order dinner already we would have ordered another one for the table.  Our table ordered The Burger, Truff Driver pizza, and Crispy Chicken Sandwich.  We had no food left on our table.  We will be back for the food and give the beer another try.",

This was the last time anyone said anything to me until I was given my credit card slip after it was charged. I had a Fatality beer which was mediocre at best, Swiss Mushroom Burger with Bacon which was ok, not a lot of flavor on the burger itself. Tater Tots were great. I would not suggest this place to anyone wanting to go to a sports bar/brewery and wanting some interaction with any of the bar tenders, it would have been nice if someone asked how my burger was or even if I liked the beer. Luckily I still tipped the bar tender that really didn't do his job. This will follow the rule of 25, where I will end up telling 25 people about the poor service and then each of them will tell 25. Thank you but no thank you, I will never visit this brewery again.",

I randomly drove by McFate Brewing Company a couple week ago and finally decided to give it a try! First off, our server Jordan was amazing. Customer service is more important to me than anything when eating out. Secondly, we wished we hadn't already eaten because everything on the menu looked amazing. But we ended up getting their buffalo wings which were incredible! Lastly, their beer selection is on point! We're big IPA drinkers, but even their ales were delicious. We highly recommend this spot! Good food, drinks, and customer service at a very reasonable price!",

There is also a cornhole spot to pass the time while sipping on some beer.  The only thing is some rude person took their dog to pee on the \"grass\".    Service was mostly good.  The gal that took care of us was initially a little cold, but then warmed up through the afternoon and we had great fun.  Food was quite good.  The pizza with spicy honey was amazing.  I never thought to put honey on my pizza, but now it may be common!  The only reason I can't give it all 5 stars, is this place is supposed to be a brewery as its first purpose.  The beer was really not that great.  I tried three different ones and they were good, but not AZ Wilderness good.  The sour was the most disappointing because it was boring and flat.  I still would come back - mostly for that pizza!!",

I spend a majority of my visits at the bar and they are always great. They make great recommendations, are knowledgeable, kind and attentive. The food is amazing!! Love the Ruben, the BBC, Pablo honey pizza, the farm salad with steak and so many more. The ever changing beer selection is one of the best around. I love any new beer they put out. The fatality, fateful, and any other IPA they roll out has never disappointed. I have met the owner and other management and was pleasantly surprised. Its always nice to see how involved a management team is with their customers and staff. If you are going to try any brewery in the area, make sure Mcfate is on your list of stops. It will go above and beyond your expectations!!",

It's usually always busy, but we've never had to wait for seating, which is really nice.

Food order was wrong- as he ordered a hamburger instead of the black bean burger.... no check back, no to- go boxes, no service at all. The other servers, hostess, were terrific.

Had to use the salsa we got with the appetizer in order to eat it. The chicken wasn't even seasoned. Beer is ok. Really the only reason we ever went. But I am giving it 1 star because of the owner. We were there with a group of 10 and apparently that inconvenienced him. He cussed out the server who invited us. When I heard that I went to apologize and he just said 'yeah ok' then walked away. It's Fate for this place to tank. Like the company in Colorado. An owner that doesn't care about business.",

For food I split the nachos with chicken (it's definitely worth it to add the chicken, they give you a lot and it's delicious!) and the Grilled Cheese Please with tater tots with my boyfriend. The grilled cheese tasted like the good kind you make at home, and the tater tots were amazing! I can't wait to come back in the fall when it's cool enough to sit on the patio, it's super nice and there are a ton of places to sit out there!",

No food tried, but the chicken fingers looked pretty good coming out, but otherwise the appetizers seemed a bit pricey. They still had their hatch green chile beer and on this visit, you could clearly taste those chiles. It was good, but more than one beer might give you heartburn. The one thing I enjoyed here was coming in through the back doors and walking past the tanks, but the sign said I had to walk around to the front door. It was a minor inconvenience, but a major deduction in my mind.  Oh yeah, it's $5.50 for a beer. They should always have a beer for $4.",

There is plenty of room and even a private room for events (maybe my husband's bday party). When we have our amazing AZ weather, you can sit on thier patio as well.   I've tried a few pretty tasty need here. I recall one aged in whiskey barrels that made me quite happy! The colab beers are fun too; it's nice to see what some amazing local brewers can dream up together. They do  too, so if you're not sure if have a few you know you wanna try, I suggest that.   As for food....I know this sounds bananas, but try the chicken tenders. I don't what kind of magic they use to make them, but they melt in your mouth. They come with fries that I wish were hand cut, but given the yummy beer, I'll forgive them",

I am not sure if it was that the waitress couldn't handle a big group or maybe she just isn't good at her job. First her attitude was blahhh .. second she messed up on two order two of the guest didn't even get there food.  I personally had to wave her down more than ones and her attitude towards was annoyed. We still didn't complain but when we got our check she had over charge one of the girls. With an attitude like we we're the ones with the problem took the receipt and supposedly fixed . When she brought it back she notice she still over charge her which apparently annoyed her so she mention it to her again and said I don't want to be rude but I am still getting charged wrong. Waitress automatically was rude didn't even apologize and just had her manger come over.  I did waitressing all through college and before .. I get it ... but she seriously shouldn't be a waitress not with that attitude. Manager came by apologize and fixed the problem now he was amazing . Only great thing about this experience .",

We have had this sandwich before and know the meat is tasty. But this was served on a small cheap store bought white bun. The scoop of over sauced meat was minuscule.  Reminded me of school cafeteria type meal.  Plenty of standard french fries. Not as good as the 5 buck sandwich mcfate used to serve at anniversary parties. Oh well. Nothing stays the same. Sad to see the more corporate change to what was a favorite neighborhood pub.",

Most of its preference to me at this point.  With that being said we came here on Memorial Day and it was surprisingly slow.  I felt that last year the restaurant/bar world was busier on this weekend. I'm guessing it's because school has been out for a couple weeks now and people have finally left the valley. But score for us. Great friendly service, ample room for the kiddo to run around and explore. Their are cornhole bags and a beautiful outside bar. The inside was slightly busier with a beautiful view of their brewing facility.   Had the most popular ipa, the hef, a pale ale and a porter. All were solid choices. Served I. Proper glassware and complimented by fatness of quest, guac, garlic burger and snacks of my partners plate. The kiddo nibbled here and there. The salsa had a bit of chipotle and was a nice change and compliment with the ipa to start off with.   I'm saying, come here. Enjoy yourself and have a good time.",

I alerted the bartender (we were at the bar) and she grabbed my plate and tossed it and started to put in another order. I told her I definitely did not want another salad and that I just wanted it taken off of our bill, which she did. We told the manager what happened as he passed by the bar and he literally said, \"yeah I heard there was a bug in your salad\" .... and he walked away.  I know stuff happens, I wasn't upset, but I thought it was handled really poorly. No offer to buy a round of beers or anything. They just closed us out as if nothing had happened. We decided after that we wouldn't be back. There are too many other great places and the service here is not great.",

He was definitely FIVE STAR status, I wish I was better with names because he deserves a shout out.  We all ordered beer. I tried the beer with hatch chilies and I also had the cream ale. I enjoyed the chili flavor, hit right at the end. I spent a semester in new Mexico during undergrad and it was green chilies on everything there, this beer brought back fond memories of that time. I typically love cream ale but I felt like their cream ale was watery and leaning towards an IPA. I ordered the nachos as an entree and that was my biggest downfall. They were heaping and loaded, which was awesome. Our waiter recommended I get the chili in the side-glad he did! He said it was very heavy, which was True, but I also disliked the flavor. It was very sweet and pasty. ( I get that chili is one of those things that changes depending on where you're from and how they make it there. I grew up eating east coast chili and usually am pretty picky.)  The biggest strug with the nachos was not the chili though, it was the cheese. It was pretty much straight velveeta which was okay-till it all began to solidify in about 10 minutes :/ The steak sandwich was a hit with some of the girls and a lot of people ordered burgers or Salmon. No one raving about their meal, but the ambiance was lovely and the service was great.",

He raved a lot about this spot and said they had some great bites and amazing beers. I'm not a beer connoisseur, so I really didn't have my mind set on drinking as much as I cared about eating some good food. Everything on the menu looked appealing, to the point where I had a hard time making a solid choice. They have standard bar food like: your burgers/sandwiches, salads, nachos, tacos and pizzas. With the help of my waitress, I decided to try their hot sausage pizza. It was definitely hot in temperature, but not in flavor or spice. I was a little disappointed because it was not what I expected it to be. The pizza looked delicious, but tasted very bland. I honestly think I just ordered the wrong thing. I try not to order Italian food if I'm not at an Italian restaurant... You know? It's just not right lol but I'm open to exploring the restaurant a little more, it was such a nice venue with awesome hospitality!",

As a restaurant, the food is seriously mediocre and a bit overpriced. $8 guacamole and chips is a sad, sad itty bitty bowl of one mashed avocado. I decided to try the weirdest item on the menu, a pizza with roasted grapes, goat cheese and basalmic glaze. The toppings were odd and kinda worked, but mostly the thin crust pizza was burnt to hell and back on the bottom. So, go for a couple beers and sit on the patio. Be prepared for the smallest serving only guac ever (if you drop a scoop on a chip, it's like losing $0.50), and perhaps skip the grape pizza.",

When I called to let them know, the manager, Hugo, offered to remake it and refund us for it. Not to mention it was late and I'm sure their kitchen was closing. They were great. I know I can be a crab after a long and stressful day at work and sometimes all you need is your favorite sandwich so this meant everything to me--lol. We love this place and we appreciate the great customer service too. Thanks Hugo!! Btw if you must know...my favorite sandwich is the fire burger but instead of a burger I sub the patty for a crispy chicken patty. It's amazing! Cheers!",

I had Mcfate's Irish Red and my husband had the Ballast Point Even Keel Mango Session IPA which was fragrant and packed with flavor. The service was great too.

We both have worked in the food industry and are understanding of shit happening. The more disgusting part was the way staff and management handled it. Bartender grabbed the salad once we told her. She said nothing to us about it. We didn't want another salad after the incident. The manager comes up after to us and says \"normally that doesn't happen\". That is all. Wtf. Doesn't comp anything.

Not only were the apps and pizza delicious (recommend the Peggy Rita pizza), but the staff was sooo nice to us and super attentive from start to finish. The beer was really good and the atmosphere was fun. We sat at the outside bar to enjoy the weather. Cheryl the bartender is hilarious. A manager, Dave, checked on us during our meal and I thought that was really nice. I definitely will be back!",

Decided to go and celebrate her birthday there on 8/25. When we arrived it was pretty busy which wasn't a surprise. We made our way to the hostess stand and were told it would be a 30 min wait. Usually we would leave if given a wait more than 15 min but said what the heck lets go to the open seating bar area and have a few beers while we wait. We went to the outside bar and sat down.  We sat there literally 20 minutes and no one came for our order. They seemed to be taking everyone else's order around us but missed is completely. We ended up  Leaving after 25 minutes. I doubt I would ever go back. Have been to the north location and it was great.  we ended up settling for yard house.",

I expected the beer to be similar here - poorly paired flavors that weren't good and didn't make sense. I was pleasantly surprised! The beer here is extremely unique and the way they get the flavor of each beer is by using smart ingredients and methods. The sour beer is a favorite among my friends and the pretzels are an awesome pairing. The food is really well done too. It seems the owners care about making good beer and food and not just having a trendy money maker. They have a veggie burger that can be made vegan too! The staff's always been attentive and brought orders pretty quickly even when we had a work function in the back room with about 20 people.  Finally a bar that does the name brewery justice.",

I would have to recommend ordering the Fate beers, but how cool to see that the beer world is supportive of each other.  The design is really neat, we can't wait for the cooler months so we can see the garage doors go up and remember why we don't move out of the desert!  We had lunch today and although the place was packed, the service was spot on. We had a strawberry blonde waitress and one with purple streaks serving our table. The food was excellent, the Peggy Rita pizza and the Fate burger were the favorites.  Support this awesome, locally owned  treasure! Can't wait to come back and try some more Fate beer!",
