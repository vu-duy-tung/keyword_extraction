Only complaint was that they did not bother to tell me my order was ready, after they told me to wait at the counter.... and after the promise they would tell me when it was ready... it went to the front while we both (me and the food) waited twenty more minutes at separate counters ...  I'm sure it was an anomaly :)~",

    "text": "The ancient grain pancakes are crazy delicious. CRAZY. DELICIOUS. CRAZY.. I'm not sure if it is fair for me to say that though, since they were the first pancakes I have had in a very very very long time, and I had them with real maple syrup, which is good on just about anything. Oh well, I guess I will have to try them again just to be sure... The rest of the food was ok. The bacon looks very soggy and limp, wouldn't order that if you're into bacon. The vegetables were previously frozen I'm pretty sure. Everything else was pretty much what you'd expect, good enough but nothing fancy.  As for the service, it was prompt and relatively professional, and I was given everything I asked for, but I can't say I felt 100% welcome. Never before have I been asked to close out a check while I was still in the middle of eating. I might have understood if the guy's shift was ending, or the restaurant was about to close, or if they wanted me to hurry up and leave because they needed the table. However, none of these things were True. Did they think I was going to hop into my Lexus and split without paying that tiny check? I don't get it? Additionally, the server addressed me as ma'am every single time he came over to my table. I don't know anyone who appreciates being called ma'am. It's quite rude. Even grandmas prefer to be called miss. Also, When I first walked in, the host asked, \"can I help you?\" which I thought was odd. Yeah, obviously I want to eat..wtf.. this is a restaurant isn't it? Don't hosts usually ask \"how many?\" or something like this? Did I look like I didn't belong there? I don't understand. Very strange experience, service wise.  Prices are extremely reasonable. For all the things I got, my bill was super cheap.  The restroom is good.",

Love the giant cups of soda the give you with the crushed ice.  Servers and staff are friendly (but see below). The time between ordering and getting your food is good.  I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that they need to work on the attentiveness of their servers. It's hit or miss and the servers don't always come back to check on you enough. I know it's a fine line between not enough service and too much. I think Ranch House is tipping toward the not enough side. I want to emphasize though that servers are very friendly with a great attitude.  Overall, great neighborhood feel. Glad to support a local business. I'll be going back!",

I had the Light Southwest Chicken Fried Steak Smothered in the famous pork chili verde with 1 egg, small hash browns. I paid a $1 more for the biscuit and gravy instead of toast. The chili was good, but not fabulous. The chicken fried steak was tough and chewy. My favorite chicken fried steak is from Texaz Grill and this place didn't compare. And, the service wasn't that great either and it wasn't that crowded during lunch on a weekday. Overall, I'm glad I tried it. Maybe if I go back next time, I'll try something different.",

Ordered the huevos rancheros and when it was delivered by my very friendly server, I just stared at it,,,,,,,,,, almost overflowing platter of gorgeous goodness:  tortillas, perfect over-easy eggs, hash browns, excellent beans, rice, and an incredibly yummy  green chile pork sauce.  I settled in and slowly savored every delicious bite.  Then I saw my neighbor get a biscuit, and it looked so good, I ordered one too; and Damn that is better that Grandma used to make - whole different kind of flour, with great texture and flavor. As I was getting ready to leave, I saw her plating some peach cobbler, and figured that since the biscuit was so good, the cobbler had to be good too, so I got one to go.  It was really good later that night. I live in the neighborhood, and love it even more now that I know what an excellent restaurant sits right there. I'll be back.",

My absolute favorite thing is the breakfast biscuits- fresh biscuits topped with sausage patties and gravy topped with eggs over medium. Everything I've tried is great but I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy. They have all the traditional comfort food (eggs, pancakes, waffles) to the southwest style burritos. The menu is big but not too big!  This place is a total hidden gem! It's off the beaten path which is another reason why I love it. Come check it out, they also do a great lunch and carry out.",

I came in for brunch with my siblings and they weren't too busy on a Thursday at around 11am. They had a nice menu, and we sat outside, which was nicely shaded. The food took a bit longer than I had hoped to get out, and the waitress was a bit slow. The food was decent for the price, and I'd probably be back. One thing to note is that they're only open for breakfast and lunch.",

I could hear every word & told her so. Completely unprofessional! New plate without white glop much better. Waitress did deliver bill but did not speak to us for remainder of time.

I forget what search I used, but Ranch house grill was in the top 3 and for good reason. The order comes in 16oz or 8oz and it's cooked over a open flame, and comes with 3 eggs hash browns and choice of bread, it's amazing. I encourage people to not take my word for it and come try it, you'll become hooked like me. It's not standard cooking, it's very home like, the only disappointment I would have is that they're not open for dinner.",

It's a southwestern menu with lots of healthy options. A meal with coffee is going to run about $12 but it'll fill you up. I've only seen a wait line on a Sunday and normally you can seat yourself and get served quickly and friendly. The staff are great and quick to fill your water or coffee.   Try adding pork verde chili on your eggs. I found that option only recently and will make it \"my usual\" going forward.   Everything is fresh and highly awarded by food critics.

It had a hard 3+inch dried cracker crust with 1/8 inch peach jam in the middle.  The dried crust on top sounded like a countertop when thumped. On top of that was slightly burned oatmeal topping. Never get this!!  Never!",

Our waitress was over worked, being the only one to wait tables and during our visit she began to seem more and more over whelmed. I felt bad for her. I'm sure with better staffing she's be a stellar waitress. She apologized profusely when she had to come back and let me know that they were our of roast beef. I'm flexible though so I went with the avocado burger medium rare which was sooo goooood.   The food came quickly and everyone was happy with their food. I'd like to come back another day and hopefully there will be better staffing.",

It's open from 6am-3pm only, and when we arrived at 2:00, there were few other customers. It's pretty homey (if home is Oklahoma) and casual, with around 15 tables inside and several outside.  I ordered the CFS, and it was quite good, very tender with a white sausage gravy on top. The rest of the meal ranged from mediocre (mashed boxed taters and Texas toast) to awful (the vegetable mix that was just this side of baby food soft).  Hubby had a better meal overall- an egg burrito with some truly delicious homemade pork chili verde sauce, paired with crispy but not greasy shredded hash browns. They needed some seasoning, but were nowhere near the disaster that was the biscuits. Something was just wrong with them, besides being pale and puckish- too much baking powder, maybe?   I think there are some tasty gems on the menu, but you may have to wade through a few sub-par items to suss them out.",

Also, there was no wait on a Saturday morning which is a good thing since we drove by Over Easy and there was a small mob standing outside.  As far as the food goes, it was okay.  On par with Denny's or IHOP, I guess.  The hashedbrowns were overly hashed and turned to mashed.  The breakfast sandwich I had was pretty tasty but was only saved by the massive amount of cheese on it.    I might got back but there are so many other options.  I give it four stars simply because no wait, food is adequate, and the service is excellent.",

The others at my table got the huevos reancheros which wasn't that good and the Lumberjack which included eggs and three breakfast meats, all which looked good.

    "text": "I've eaten here several times but recently have been taking advantage of their evening menu on Thursday-Saturday from 4:30-8:00 pm.  Prices do seem a little high until you witness the mountain of food delivered to your table or into your takeout containers.  A previous reviewer said that you won't leave hungry, Truer words never said.  I have liked everything I've had here, but really recommend the green chile option where available.  Huevos rancheros, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried steak,  pork chile verde on anything, burgers & sliders, good basic diner food, there's something for everyone on this menu.  Service has been good for me, and takeout orders have been ready promptly, but more important:  accurately,  so no complaints there.  Delivery is available for the evening menu, which can be nice if you're being especially lazy.  Good to have a nice little place like this in the neighborhood, so I'm doing my part to keep them in business.  Oh, I do wish they'd use Heinz or Hunt's ketchup; that restaurant supply house brand sucks.",

The food was decent and the potions were huge, however the service was horrible! Since we were unable to get a table, we chose to  sit at the bar. I am not sure if the waiting staff was new, or what was going on but we had like three different waitresses randomly ask us who was serving us and getting annoyed when we couldn't locate the last person that helped us. I don't know if everyone was just really confused on how seating worked or what was going on but it seemed like the only thing the staff cared about was who was going to get the tip off the ticket. Near the end of the meal, the waitress laid down our ticked and walked away and didn't even bother to interact with us and ask us about our experience. My boyfriend and I were bother servers through college and we could not believe how much we were being treated as just a tip and not a customer. I honestly think they could not have cared less that we were there. I am super disappointed because this restaurant is super close to my house. I never judge a restaurant off of the first visit, I  try this establishment again and update my review if my experience is better.",

She was overjoyed with the waffle, which I thought was great.  I had Chicken Fried Steak with eggs and silver dollar pancakes.  The steak was great, gravy was tasty, and the pancakes were at least 6 inches in diameter--which pleasantly surprised me, as I was expecting them to be a lot smaller.  They tasted really great as well.  We left full (but not exploding) for $30 plus tip.  All in all, a good experience and we'll defintely be back!!!",

We heard about this place from our old roommate who is a chef, and my dad couldn't wait to go try it.  Typically a healthy eater, my dad loves to splurge on something artery-clogging from time to time.  I'm just glad I get to go along for the ride.  The first time we went, my dad noticed a not-so-svelte man sitting at a table in front of the window.  My dad looked toward him and said \"Ooohh.  This is gonna be GOOD!\"  He was right.  The chicken fried steak is tender and juicy, the eggs have always been perfectly fine and the gravy is so thick and creamy I can feel it taking years off my life.  Pancakes are an easy kid-pleaser, so everyone comes out full and content.    I'm glad I get to go here once or twice a year and that's enough for me.",

A casual, daytime breakfast and lunch spot that caters to a slightly older crowd. We can literally walk here, so we hit it from time-to-time. But it doesn't have the same charm or unique menu favorites (Eggs Maximillian, Parisienne, etc) that a place like Harlow's in Tempe does. You need that to pull people from outside the hood.  DECOR I would call it kitchsy country cafe, but they mean it. So it's not kitschy. It seriously looks like a midwestern diner, in 1974. No nonsense.  FOOD Pretty good. Wish it were better. Good, hearty breakfast. Eggs cooked nicely, as ordered. Meats and sides prepared competently. Standard, reliable comfort food. It's straight-up midgrade foodservice stuff. Ultimately, frozen Shamrock/Sysco everything. Some things are better than others: the green chile poured over greasy fries is an excellent gutbomb. But the burgers are overcooked - maybe the meat necessitates that. Seems like a kickass burger should be a staple at a place like this.  I still have some menu exploration to do, so I'll update.  All in all, they seem to be doing well and serving their demographic what they want. I just wish Matt's was across the street instead.",

The Steak and Eggs came on 3 plates with the steak covering one plate by itself. The Eggs and Hashbrowns came on another  plate while the slightly burnt pancakes had their own plate. The steak was huge and fairly juicy but pretty thin, the hash browns were crispy  and on the dry side with the pancakes a little on the burnt side.  Definitely quantity over quality.  The Loco Moco was also generous and pretty good with the gravy and topped of course  with an egg.   The incident that most stuck in my mind was I asked for a take out box loaded it up paid for the meal and left without it. As I drove off my son mentioned  the left overs so the restaurant closes ar 300 pm and we left at 310 pm and were a mile away when I decided  to drive back. When I got there the door was locked so I knocked and our waitress opened the door and said she kept  the take out container knowing I would come back.  So impressed by the waitress who's name I don't  know but she had blond hair and was very thin built.  Will definitely come back here because of her.",

But I go here for breakfast at least once a week now that my other casual neighborhood spot closed, and I love it. The omelettes are plain fantastic, service is always fast and super friendly, the staff is great, and all that adds up to one of the best breakfast spots in the Valley.   Plus I just love the atmosphere - straight out of another, more comfortable, casual era.   Worth the visit.",

We ate there just before we left and we ate there again this past weekend. Both of those times the food was subpar and this past time we see the prices were significantly increased. Prices were at the same level as Butterfield's in Scottsdale and yet the food quality and ambiance aren't even close. Just as an example, 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast, no meat is $9. In addition we couldn't eat the hash browns. The flavor picked up the taste of a greasy, burnt griddle. My wife and I both left ours uneaten. Made for a pretty expensive breakfast. After two disappointments we'll not be back.",

    "text": "Today I experienced the worst service ever. It was so bad we walked out... our server Jill was extremely rude. Several folks around us had placed their orders, plus a gentleman that came well after us placed his order and they were all served. I simply looked over to our server Jill as she walked by and motioned as to where is our food. She immediately smirked shrugged as she motioned to the kitchen. Finally food arrived, I asked what happened and she snapped  with such anger \"I don't control the kitchen!\".  I responded as why she was so upset and she walked away. She was so angry and not to mention disrespectful. A simple sorry for the delay would have been good. As she walked back to the kitchen I decided to ask to speak to the manager, she then came stomping out yelling I'm the manager. At this time I requested to speak with the owner and she said to return sat 1 pm when he is in. Why in the world does something like this need to happen. We work hard for my money and choose to spend it at this restaurant for terrible service. Hell no! It was so upsetting we couldn't stay let alone eat. We will not put up with such horrible service. No more bad service! We as a community have been accepting mediocre service for so long it has become the norm. It is time for us to say something about it, we need to put our foot down . We choose to patronize these places and they choose the service they want to provide. It would be preferable to have good food and excellent service to go along with it. I don't know if Leland can do anything to make what happened today right, we do enjoying coming here so just maybe we will try again. On thing for sure I will never allow Jill to serve us.",

So, knocked it off my list when my cousin was in town and we met up for breakfast.   Since RHG's chili verde was noted as extra special, I went with the R.H.G. Huevos Rancheros. My cousin went with the Pork Chili Verde Omelet. YUMS! This is real comfort food in the morning.   Serving sizes are substantial. Service was quick and she made sure things landed together while keeping drinks topped off. And the crowd feels like old-town America, where the waitress new a lot of them as regulars.",

After taking our order she asks if we wanted another waiter and I told her NO as she has taken our orders already.   Food finally arrives. My Mary Jane sandwich was alright but the hash browns had a taste that I could describe as soapy. Maybe they were frozen.   The gravy was very salty. The servings were massive but will not compensate for mediocre flavor.  Coupled with bad service - Not coming back. Disappointed.",

Pork chops were on the dry and overcooked side but the only reason I got the chops only because they were all out of corned beef hash that I really wanted. I got my chops smothered in green chili Verde, which was good, but not marvellous. They were also all out of meatlof that my husband wanted, so he instead got a turkey melt that was good.  Service on Sat afternoon when it was not busy at all was not very good. Extremely slow and kind of lackadaisical.  Service on Sunday at 11 am when they were slammed was quite good.   Overall, it's good grub in a nice atmosphere with decent service. Cant wait to eat outside on a nice day.  Decent prices too. We will be back.",

Do yourself the biggest favor, go order the Southwest chicken fried steak, and fall in love. I now live in Colorado but everytime I come back into town, I order that exact same dish, and it's always as delicious as I remember. Thank you Ranch house, and congrats on 10 year!!!! P.S. If you're like me and can't finish their amazingly large portions, ask for the Lite version of your order, for example my lite southwest chicken fried steak comes with less hash browns, one less egg, and half the toast (but all of the meat), for a couple bucks less.

I placed a pick up order through Yelp and received my confirmation e-mail that my order would be ready within 10-35 mins. 20 mins later I come by and have someone go in to pick up the food. When they asked the waitress for the order under one of our names, the waitress said she did not have any orders under that name but handed us an order that seemed similar and we paid. When I checked the take out boxes to see our food, I quickly realized that it was someone else's order. I went inside and informed the waitress that this was not our order and specified what I had ordered. She went to the kitchen and came back and said my order was not done yet. I went outside to wait in the car expecting it to be a couple minutes long. When I come back inside the waitress tells me they never received any order and asked what I would like to eat.

When you see your co-worker multi tasking and overloaded and all you are doing is cleaning a table that doesn't need to be cleaned that particular second with no customers waiting to be seated.....Stop, Think, & Assess. Little Miss Waitress, when our waiter was multi tasking and overloaded and we had waited quite a while for our order to be taken and we asked you for assistance, we were looking for more than \"He'll be with you in a second. He is busy.\" You were cleaning a table next to us. No one waiting for that table and no one else beckoning for you. What would have been 90 seconds of your time to take an order for 2 to help your co worker out and make a customer happy? And your eye roll didn't help the matter. If you had taken our order for him and gave it to him, saying, \"Buddy, I saw you were busy. I took the initiative and took their order to help you out. And here it is....    You would have made us happy and also him. Another option is asking for help. Our waiter could have asked for assistance from his coworkers that were not busy to please pack TO GO orders, ring the cash register, or to take our order. Wondering if there was a supervisor or manager monitoring the floor at this time that could have identified the breakdown of coordination.  Our meals were tasty. Portions were filling. However, I do question my mashed potatoes because there was a side that had a hard crusty spot and a little discolored. The Texas Toast was actually toast. Quite different from what I am accustomed. I am used to the bread being grilled instead of going through a toaster. The toaster makes for a dried out center. The sausage gravy was \"spot on\" good.",

We came around 1pm on a Wednesday. There were not many people there. I did bring my 2 year old and 2 month old. My grandma, mother-in-law, and husband were also with me. The wrap was so-so. The chili soup was way too spicy.   The main thing that irritated me is, they locked the doors at 2pm! My husband went to take my two year old outside for fresh air and it was locked with the keys hanging from the keyhole! Multiple customers had issues getting out because the hostess/waitress kept opening and locking different doors. Hostess' response to this was \"We're closing soon.\" In an hour?!? Food and service not worth the price. Bummer.",

I had been wanting to try this spot since I got in the Phoenix area because it had pretty solid reviews and a larger menu, but I wasn't impressed the first showing. I'll give it another try eventually and hopefully get a little more adventurous with my choices. My eye will be on the breakfast menu next go.",

I took a co-worker out after work and we both decided to try breakfast. I ordered the Pork Chili Verde (topped with cheddar, smothered in pork chili verde) and my friend ordered some meat omelet and added veggies. We also had biscuits and gravy for our sides. My food was amazing. Words cannot explain how tasty it was. The gravy for the biscuits was like crack! It was so addicting I want more just thinking about it right now. The service was good as well.

Homemade just like mom or grandma cooked when you were a kid, well that's what you can expect at Ranch House Grille. The menu selection is huge so you can satisfy your craving for eggs, pancakes, omelets or a burger. Maybe split a few meals between the family or friends, that's what I do, and trust me no one is disappointed with a variety of flavors to go around. Awesome service, too - thanks to Noah! I didn't have to wait long for the meals to arrive, so add this spot to your brunch to-do list!",

I had a half size breakfast plate and there was plenty! It was a fairly normal order eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, and toast but it was prepared exactly how I like it. My boyfriend had the special, breakfast chimis w rice and beans the first time and ouevos ranchero the next and he LOVED both! Huge portions, he didn't finish it and the flavor was amazing. They make their own salsa too and it's delicious. Atmosphere is a small family diner type, definitely comfortable and they take pride in their establishment. I recommend this restaurant for breakfast over any other in Scottsdale purely for the outstanding quality to price ratio.",

We gladly accepted since we often find the service at the counter a step above table service.  We weren't disappointed.  Our waitress as very friendly and rountinely checked in with us during our meal.    Wife and I love steak and eggs so we both ordered the smaller 8oz portion.  In addition I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy for .75.  We got three eggs cooked perfectly, mine sunnyside up and the wife's basted.  Each platter (yes I said platter) had a large portion of golden hash browns, and two, not one cut of perfrectly cooked steak to order.  Not since our days in CHicago had we seen such a generous portion of steak on a plate.  The biscuits were just average at best, more like a dinner roll but the sausage gravy was the best I've had in the valley since we have been here,  Bottomline, this is the first time my wife has asked for a to go box for her steak.  She was stuffed as was I.  In fact we were so stuffed that on way home we decided to change our dinner plans to only a light salad!!!!",

As for the food, it was ok but nothing to get excited and recommend friends to. I've read that the chicken fried steak was amazing but the server told me they're not fresh but frozen which killed that idea.   Here's the why for 3 stars: We had a breakfast burrito smothered with a $.99 side of pancakes and coffee. Huevos rancheros with coffee and a strawberry crepe with water. Our bill total was $48 for the three of us and the girl at the register couldn't explain why. And that didn't include the tip!   We came here because our other favorites had long waits and when I called they said they could sit us immediately, should've known something wasn't right.  Bottom line we would not go back as nothing stood out, if the food was out of this would I wouldn't mind the expense.",

It's a locally owned place, I think run by a family, which counts for some points with me. Too bad the service is horrible. After we checked in with the host, multiple parties (larger, smaller, and the same size as ours) were all seated before us. When we finally did get seated, the waitress was inattentive and not knowledgeable about the menu. After a 40 minute wait (for breakfast!) she brought out the wrong plate of food, which my friend was just going to eat because we didn't want to wait for another plate to be made. Instead, after he had taken a bite, she did bring out the correct plate. That would have been great except we saw her JUST BRING THAT SAME PLATE OVER TO ANOTHER TABLE!!! Wow. When we complained later to the manager, he said \"I know, I've heard it all before. Just pay up and don't come back, I guess.\" That has got to be the worst customer service I've ever experienced! Too bad Ranch House Grille, I really wanted to add you to my Phoenix rotation!",

I had been craving some corned beef hash and eggs, but after consulting with the staff, I decided to go with their specialty, the Southwest Chicken Fried Steak (and eggs). . when prompted to toast or biscuit and gravy, I decided to go with the biscuit and gravy...  After a short wait, my food arrived. It was a FULL plate of food.. a big rectangular block of shredded hash browns, with a nice, brown crispy crust on them. Three eggs, cooked to the perfect over easy, and the chicken fried steak. But instead of the usual sausage/cream gravy, this southwest version was covered with a pork chili verde. And on the side plate was a big square biscuit with a cup of sausage gravy. The main plate was delicious and very filling. The biscuit was a little unusual. Not sure what kind of flour they use, as it was more of a tan color inside instead of the usual white, and while it was very light and fluffy, it was VERY crumbly. It was different from any biscuit I have ever had before.. The crumbly-ness of it made it hard to eat with the gravy.  Service was so so.. They man who came over with my menu when I first sat down, was very helpful. I let him know I was a first timer, and he gave me a little low down on the place and the menu. My waitress (Pam, I think), did an ok job but never did come over to offer a tea refill (until I was getting up to pay). My main complaint with service was that I was offered toast or biscuit/gravy, but was not informed that the biscuit/gravy would be an additional 99cents.",

They're a little (emphasis on \"little\") bit pricey for what you get, but I'm definitely planning on another trip.",

Instead of toast we opted for the biscuits and gravy- an amazing upgrade for just 75 cents more. We headed out the door as full as if we just had a Thanksgiving feast. Oh, and we were holding go-cups of the drinks we had with our meals. Excellent service and management at a place that does it right.",

I'm a huge fan of the veggie omelet, always such a fresh vegetables!! Ask for your hash browns southwest style and they chop up peppers and onion and mix those in. Yum! I've never tried anything from the lunch menu but they have recently expanded their menu and it is tempting if I can straw away from my love for breakfast food. Always, always friendliest of service. Has a mom and pop shop feel, you go to the counter to pay your bill. Adorable little place that's always on my good list!",

We tried other menu items, all good, but now we all fill up on their chicken fried steak 'light' that comes with crunchy good hash browns, egg & toast.  The full size CFS is too large.  The cooks are talented in 'Real Arizona' style food.  I felt comfy and at home on the first visit.  The AZ western art decor reminded me of my youth and a little cafe in Page, AZ Mom used to take us to.  The wait staff are friendly and efficient every time we go.  Which is every other weekend for two years!  Ok to be honest, once in that time the kitchen messed up our order and another time a new waiter wasn't on the ball.  But RHG always attempted to make it right for us.  Go try RHG for quality Arizona cafe style food and you won't regret it. There is parking in the back.",

I need consistency in the restaurants I visit, and after a couple of visits, Ranch House Grille got progressively dissapointing.  First visit: we ordered the half order of the chicken fried steak breakfast and the fried chicken and waffles. Yum! Loved that the half order was perfectly proportioned and at $7, perfect price. This visit topped it off and made us want to come back the next weekend.   Second visit: womp. womp. womp. This visit may have been a bad day for the chef because not only did they have to recook our chicken (leading to a really long wait) but the biscuits and gravy order was just not appetizing at all. The biscuits were so dense that after a while, it was actually tiring to chew!  So I don't know.. I need more Arcadia/East Phoenix brunch options.",

We finally got our order an hour after ordering and we got 1 1/2 of our order after we flagged down another waitress to ask for it, and it was cold because it was sitting at the pass for awhile.

The texas style french toast is also amazing, thick slices lightly sweet batter. Not going to say it is as good as grandma's but a darn good substitute.   It's a casual place with ample table space and rustic decor. The staff is pleasant and generally attentive with our rushing you. Prices are fare and you get a-lot of food for the money.

The craving was for Fried Catfish and Eggs, which is not an easy thing to find here in the Valley. I turned to Yelp for assistance and Ranch House Grille showed up in my feed. After seeing pictures posted by others I was SOLD! Let me just say that RHG did not disappoint. From the moment I walked in everything was absolutely Fabulous! My coffee was divine, they had flavored creamer. My food came rather quickly and even though I was dining alone my server Annette did not forget about me (which happens a lot when you dine alone), she made sure to check on me often  I watched as she greeted a few regulars who came in like old friends and instantly started writing this post in my head. THE FOOD was also amazing! My catfish was perfectly seasoned and fried! The eggs were fluffy and the hash browns were delightful. The star of the meal however, was this individual biscuit and gravy that I ordered, I wanted to drink that gravy! I decided not to, lol!   Five Diamonds From Me Here! This was an incredibly fabulous experience, will absolutely visit again!",

Today I discovered their \"award-winning pork chile verde\" and my life will pretty much never be the same! To say that I hate onions is an understatement, and much to my surprise, they have masterfully created this menu item WITHOUT them! I had ordered it on top of the veggie omelette, and there was enough to also eat it with our side of homemade potato chips and my boyfriend's bacon cheeseburger. I cannot wait to go back now and try the pork chile verde on top of the chicken fried steak, and then maybe on top of the meatloaf, and then maybe even on a salad. The restaurant is always clean as a whistle, and I appreciate that the servers have come to know us. They even recall our beverage order upon seating us. It's not fancy, but with great food, great service, and a strong sense of community, it remains a go-to for us.",

It is a bit \"divey\" inside but the workers were very nice. Parking was also a bit of an issue as they only have a small number of spots in their lot in front of the place, so we ended up parking at the business next door on the right that had a big lot. Seems like others were doing this too.  They have some outdoor seating but it was too hot when we were here so we dined inside where it was nice and cool. They have tables and also some counter seating available.  If ever in the area again I'd come back for sure. It is a good place to come after an early morning at the Zoo or the Botanical gardens as it is close by.",

Cozy, family atmosphere. Not too crowded - about 1/2 the tables wwre full at 10:30 on a Friday. Reasonable prices especially for the amnt of food you get. We both coyld only finish half of our meals.  Our server was friendly & very attentive.   I had the Spicy Tortilla. Amazing! My husband had the Huevos Rancheros. Equally amazing!   The Southwest Chicken Fried Steak looked wonderful and that is what I'm getting my nxt visit. Yes, we will be back! I highly recommend this place for breakfast!!",

I got a side of sausage links as well and they came with 4 links that were cooked perfectly. I love this place! My only complaint was that the online menu said the burrito is 9.99 but I got my bill and I was charged 12.99 when I picked it up. $3 price hike is pretty significant. Sausage was nearly $5 and my tea was $3 so breakfast was over 20 bucks. But....it was delicious.",

I went with a group of 8 and everyone's eggs came out perfect just as ordered over easy was perfect, over medium, etc..   My friend has been coming here for many years and suggested I try the southwest chickens fried steak. Wow the green chili that smothers the steak is next level I could eat a bowl of it alone.

The waiter was so friendly, I thought he was going to ask me out, which was not an issue.  Friendliness over moodiness any day!  I have been about a dozen or so times with my clients to this country bit of a cafe in the Arcadia/Biltmore area.  The eggs are always fresh yet the coffee isn't worth a bean ~ AND I LOVE COFFEE!  I adore steak and eggs and the steak is less than moovelous ; -(    SOOO, I'll try the pancakes next time.  I like to stay in my neighborhood when I go out to eat, it will be worth another shot!",

Out of a sense of duty, i offered the hubby a bite, and luckily, he was too busy devouring his steak and eggs, thus declining.. My huevos rancheros had perfectly cooked (over well) eggs on top of corn tortillas. On top? A delicious pork green chili that was to-die-for delish. In addition, you get rice and beans, AND hash browns!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!  The place is darling, very comfortable and has very nice personnel that are will to please.

Their pork chili verde sauce is really delicious - we'd never been here before and when the waitress found out, she brought each out a little sample.  Really nice of her!   Country music on in the background.  Inside is a little plain, but it's clean and pleasant enough. I had the southwestern chicken fried steak, which was delicious, and came smothered in their famous and delicious pork chili verde sauce.  The hashbrowns were perfectly crispy, but could have used a bit of salt/seasoning.  Thankfully, I had plenty of gravy from my biscuit with gravy side to spare, to top my hashbrowns off with.  My friend had the omelette special of the day, which had bacon, jalepenos and jack cheese - he opted to have his smothered in the pork chili verde sauce as well.    The waitress mentioned they offer delivery service for only $2 - so we got menus to go, just in case we want to have some delivered to our hotel room before we go.  Yum!",

I don't think either of us will be back. The wait was only a couple in front of us, but took almost 25 minutes to be seated, and the way the restaurant was laid out, we had to basically stand in front of the door while waiting.  Also, I had to chase down the waiter to even get on the wait list.  Once seated, I opened the menu, ready to get the black bean burger I'd seen online...their only non-egg vegetarian item.  I had purposely scouted the menu online before coming in, since they didn't seem super veg friendly.  Yeah. Apparently, they no longer serve veggie burgers. Nope.  So when I asked our server, as a vegetarian, what I could get, she told me there was some sort of dish that one of the servers made with cottage cheese, mushrooms and avocado.  I had no option but to ask for that.  When it came out, after a good deal of time, it was a small cup of oily mushrooms, a plate with half an avocado on it, and a small cup of cottage cheese.  Um. Gross.  I stole a piece of my partner's toast, mixed in ketchup with the mushrooms, and put it on the toast with a little avocado on top. It was ok, but I could have made it better myself, and for less than the almost $7 they charged me for my \"meal.\"  Add to that the homophobia and transphobia we felt, plus the coffee refill guy walking past my partner's empty cup not once, not twice, but three times, and we'll not be back. Which is too bad, because my partner love love loved her Denver omlette and hashbrowns.  Folks, it takes more than good food to make a good restaurant.",

Breakfast Sandwish.  All our entrees were absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are very generous so come hungry.  The Breakfast Biscuits are served open faced topped with sausage patties, smothered in prpper gravy, topped with eggs and served with hash browns.  The biscuits and gravy are absolutely delicious and definitely enough to feed two.  The chicken fried steak and breakfast sandwich looked appealing and my family members confirmed their entrees were absolutely delicious.  Great service and reasoable pricing. I would definitely recommend if you're in the area.",

Now that we've got that out of the way, some comments:  -$18 for loco moco and coffee was pretty steep - Serving was huge, 3 eggs, rice gravy, burger patty, hash brown,  and toast - I was surprised it came with hash browns...you don't see that in Hawaii.  That being said there were enough hash browns for 3 people - They could easily reduce food cost by eliminating one egg and all or at least part of the hash browns and that would get the bill under $18  Overall, good most likely somewhere between a 4 and 5.  But, the pricing was just out of line.",

We were sat immediately. The waitress was the only one but she was very attentive. The menu is huge! I had a lot of trouble deciding. I ordered the corned beef hash, now this is the worst thing our table ordered. It was okay, you can tell it came from a can. I had a side of biscuit and gravy. The gravy was so good! You could've convinced me we were in the south. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle. It was a ginormous portion, definitely enough to share. The chicken was tenders not whole pieces of chicken. But the tenders were good! Nice and crispy. The waffle was very fluffy, tasted nice with butter and syrup. My boyfriends brother got the country fried chicken. I was most skeptical about this dish as instead of the typical white gravy, it was served with green chili gravy. This ended up being my favorite dish! The gravy went perfectly with the crispy chicken. I will mention, every meal was a huge portion. Everything could be split.",

It's super hard to deviate from their chicken fried steak breakfast because it's just that good.  so tender you can cut it with a fork and the flavors are perfect.  The white gravy is perfect and the green chili verde sauce adds a great lunch twist to it as well!  The staff is always friendly and greet you with a smile, the prices are very reasonable and you'll always walk away full.  Highly recommend",

    "text": "Best way for me to describe the RHG is: Solidly good, old fashioned comfort food.   Having lived in Scottsdale now for over five years I have probably passed the RHG 20-30 times, but had yet to eat there. Before deciding to try it for breakfast, I read the reviews, and as expected there were some complaints, but mostly the reviews were positive, as is mine. I am a believer that anyone can have a bad experience at any restaurant; Bad day for the server or cook, or simply mistakes can happen. It is always best to judge for yourself based on your experiences.  Being my first experience I must say that the breakfast menu is fairly extensive with a wide variety of omelets, pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, steak and eggs and other choices.  I ordered off the 'Light' menus and I must say the  use of the word 'light' was misleading. Mine was to be one egg, sausage patty and a pancake with crumbled bacon.  The pancake was huge and overflowing the plate. If it had been half the size, I would have been fine with it!    I did also order a side of a biscuit (no gravy), just to try one. The biscuit was very light and fluffy with an excellent taste. One minor complaint was the biscuit was so light it literally fell apart on the plate. But the flavor was very good.  Service was prompt, efficient and friendly.  If you are looking for large servings of basic comfort food, this is the place.",

I believe the original recommendation was about a weekend breakfast he had enjoyed. I finally had an opportunity to check it out at lunch time with one of my colleagues.  Ranch House Grille is just as cozy on the inside as it appears on the outside. And it's all perfectly in line with what you would expect in a breakfast/lunch type \"cafe\". More importantly, the atmosphere is relaxing and the dining room is clean.  Our server was very friendly too. It wasn't very busy, so I can only presume that the breakfast crowd must be their bread and butter. I hope I'm wrong, because the lunch menu is extensive. Ranch House Grille may only be open til 2:00, but the menu has several options that would satisfy any dinner cravings. In other words, I already know I want to come back for some breakfast... and \"dinner\".  Back to my lunch. I was in the mood for a simple burger and found a great option. The Crazy Bills was a single burger with blue cheese crumbles, bacon and lettuce, tomato & onion. The char-grille flavor is wonderful and the kitchen nailed the medium cook I requested. This was a delicious burger and the fries are excellent.  This was a very good first impression of Ranch House Grille. I'm sure I will be back with other co-workers and maybe my sons to check out breakfast. Thanks y'all!",

I had received a $5 off coupon in the mail so I decided to check it out.  I was expecting it to smell of smoke from the recent building fire next door, but there wasn't even a trace of it. (The RH was closed for about 6 months after the fire.) I found a seat by a window, sat down and was greated by the waitress. I ordered an orange juice, one egg over medium (the waitress helped me order my eggs cooked just the way I like them) with buttered toast. I substituted the hash browns for a fruit cup.  Everything was great and almost free after my coupon! Next time I'll bring my Kindle to read while I dine. I might even bring Peekaboo when it cools off outside because I noticed a couple with a Great Dane sit down at a table on the outside patio. Dog friendly? It must be.",

My bill was $23.00. The seems absolutely ridiculous, up charge for avocado and egg whites. These prices have turned me off of Ranch House, I will be eating breakfast at Kitchen 56 just up the road. They have breakfast entrees for $9.56 and the quality is great and food gets to the table very quickly. Ranch house has really started to go down hill, the prices are outrageous, the amount of time it takes for the food to hit the table is too long, and the hand writing checks is archaic. Very unhappy customer of many years.",

It is a comfortable environment with meals that taste like you are back in your mom's kitchen. There is incredible cobbler made from scratch and SO MANY other original southwest style meals.   My favorite dishes are the California Chicken sandwich and the Atomic Chicken sandwich. The menu is flexible, and it is easy to customize your order to fit your taste.

The service was prompt and friendly, the prices were fair and the food was pretty good.  The huevos rancheros with roasted pork green chili was very tasty.  I would probably get that again if I were dining at Ranch House Grill again.  The diced green chili and cheese omelet was less impressive.  The green chili in the omelet didn't have alot of flavor and the omelet itself needed more cheese.  The shredded potatoes were nice and buttery but I like them with some crispiness, at least on the top and bottom.  These were a bit soggy but still good.  They just needed another minute on the grill.",

Apologized to the new waitress and asked for the correct sides. Got my okra which was wonderful but with cottage cheese. It was actually funny and I felt bad for the waitress (who was brand new) and felt badly but said the kitchen was confused. :-)   Took a friend there for dinner about a week ago and the dinners were great-I had the regular chicken fried steak and will again! We were full but wanted to treat ourselves with peach and cherry cobbler...mmm-not much flavor, too much batter and it was ice cold. Sorry, just did not care for it.

One person received something he did not even order. Another had ordered strawberries and whipped cream on her waffle and received a waffle with strawberries sloppily plated (no whipped cream).  She stopped the waitress and asked for whipped cream and the waitress did not acknowledge her request and walked away. She came back with a bowl of whipped cream.

    "text": "Truely Satisfying!  I had been intending to have breakfast here for months, and today I finally did. I was totally pleased with every aspect of my visit. The restaurant itself is inviting, and I loved the table I chose in the corner by the window. It was bright and sunny.   Almost immediately after I seated myself one of the servers brought me a menu and let me know that Anne would be my server, and that she would be right with me. Anne came to my table with a smile on her face, and I ordered coffee and asked for a few minutes to study the menu.  I really didn't need much time since I had studied the menu online, and so when she returned with my coffee I went ahead and ordered the Original Chicken Fried Steak and substituted a biscuit for the toast..   The coffee was actually good, not the usual afterthought that many restaurants serve. When my meal came, there was so much food that I literally didn't know where to start, so I took my time buttering my biscuit which I figured was as good a place to begin as any.   Of all of the biscuits I've had in restaurants over the years, this was far and away THE BEST. It was like a really good home made biscuit, and begged to be followed by a mouth full of chicken fried steak with sausage gravy. The chicken fried steak was crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked (not dry) on the inside. The gravy was to die for and the whole dish was nicely seasoned. My eggs were cooked exactly the way I ordered them, and everything was piping hot.   Every mouthful was delicious, but the portion was so large that I soon realized that I wouldn't be able to finish the meal. My decision? I didn't want to leave any of the biscuit behind, it was just too good, so I focused on that and ate almost all of it.   My experience - large helpings of really delicious food, great service, and a really nice friendly environment. Next time I'll order something smaller so that I have room to try the cobbler.",

I was like sure lets give it a try.   It took them 20 minutes to seat us, as it was busy and too cold & windy to sit outside. The service was good and people amiable. It was a typical breakfast place, right from pancakes, omlettes, salads, burgers, burritos, etc.   Had a few veggie options, like a typical breakfast place. I got the avacado and black bean patty omelette. Check pix. Havta say didn't like the patty since it was soy based (like BOCA) and not a black bean garden based. I got a side of the southwestern hash browns and a French toast, both were good as well.   All said and done, no particular reason I havta go back to this place when there are places like Mimi's and lolo's. it's a small place with good people and decent food at almost the same price as other places.",

    "text": "In an odd situation were I had to be up all night, but had four hours to kill before a 10:00am flight, and had no desire to drive from downtown Phoenix to Desert Ridge then back south to the airport, I decided one of the best ways to kill some time was to sit down and have breakfast. Since I didn't want to spend any more money than I had to, I decided to hit up local dines (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2Fphoenix%3Fref%3D19485&s=13f273d311728f7448ff75fcf55bdaf2585245ad2d7e3c3cc0823dcdee2befc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/phoenix?r...</a>) and found a $20 for $10 gift certificate to Ranch House Grille, a breakfast spot pretty close to Sky Harbor that starts service at 6:00am. It's open. I have a coupon. Why not?  The food is good for what it is. I had a Denver Omelet. The eggs were cooked well, and the fillings were fine. The hash browns were awful. The portion is massive, but bland is too kind of a word to describe the taste. There wasn't enough salt, ketchup, or hot sauce on the table to give these potatoes any flavor. I would definitely recommend subbing with any of the other sides. The coffee was good and refilled often. A large orange juice was not worth the $4.59 price. If it was fresh squeezed, it certainly didn't taste like it. If isn't, then I could've bought a gallon of Tropicana down the street at Fry's for less.  Not that I was looking for anything fancy, but the restaurant is nothing special in terms of ambiance and decor. It looks a lot like an old office that's been gutted into one big room. There's some stuff hanging from the walls, but nothing all that pleasant to look at. Service was great. There was just one woman handling the handful of tables and cashiering duties. She was as pleasant and efficient as could be. She also was one of the first servers that I have ever handed a local dine certificate (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.localdines.com%2Fphoenix%3Fref%3D19485&s=13f273d311728f7448ff75fcf55bdaf2585245ad2d7e3c3cc0823dcdee2befc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">localdines.com/phoenix?r...</a>) who knew exactly how it worked. The total was a little less than my local dine. I gave her a few bucks in cash for a tip and made my way to the airport.",

Good size patio as well, but we did not eat there. $6 kids meals are awesome!  I ordered the \"Coronary Burger\". A whopping $10! (Actually really worth it). This burger came with two huge pieces if bacon, an egg, and all the trimmings. It was delicious!  The wait staff was a bit understaffed, not the waitresses fault but this place lost a star for that. Out waitress was great though, when she could get to us. She was very pleasant despite being obviously overwhelmed. Total meal cost was about 45 bucks for two kids and two adults, worth it. If you get a chance to stop you should. Next time I'm getting breakfast.",

My daughter Ordered bowl of red chili I ordered bowl of pork chili verde My granddaughter ordered Kale salad - specifically because it would be gluten free, with the blueberries and the avocado on the side because she did not want them but was giving them to me. She also added chicken.  My daughter received red chili too extremely spicy for any of us to eat My granddaughter received a salad in a fried flour tortilla shell with no kale in it, her added chicken was put on the side - my granddaughter said she couldn't eat the chicken because it wasn't completely cooked and was still \"squishy\"  The blueberries, which came to me, were mostly very over ripe, and spoiling. Some were even moldy. After trying to pick through them, I just gave up on eating any  The pork chili verde which I received had skin of some sort in it, but otherwise seemed to be okay though it tasted unlike anything I had ever had, but later I got horribly ill with extreme, painful intestinal cramping, diarrhea, and chills.  When we asked where was the kale in my granddaughter's kale salad, we were told that they had discontinued that salad so they just gave us something else. They seemed offended that we objected and expected to receive what we ordered. They even asked what was wrong with the salad they had brought us! Specifically, they said, \"Is there something WRONG with the salad we brought you?\"  When my daughter said she wanted the salad taken off the bill they acted offended.  They began sweeping the floor near us and putting the chairs up on the tables while we were still eating.  I am not sure why ANYONE would like this place. The only thing it has going is location and that is simply not enough - not for me.",

I had the crepes with strawberries. My only issue with it was that it was the pre-macerated strawberries and they didn't look good - they came on the side so no harm done, but now I know!

    "text": "Still pretty good alright after all of these years!  For solid diner food in this part of town, you can't go too wrong.  I usually order huevos rancheros, as it's usually \"brunch\" when I'm here, and sometimes I'm not feeling at the top of my game...  Chicken fried steak and the biscuits are great.  My dining companion is right in his assessment that this place is \"just OK.\"  It's not gourmet, and it's not necessarily the \"bestest\" diner food.  And for some, the pork-based green chili sauce is bland.  (I'ts NOT New Mexico).    But the staff are AMAZING.  And it's predictable, prompt, and the outdoor patio is very, very nice (in Spring and Fall).   When in the area, it's on my \"will eat breakfast here once\" list.",

    "text": "I almost give this place 3 stars, but as far as my experience goes, it's not there yet, and I would honestly rather have IHOP or Denny's.  Saturday morning at 9:30ish seems to be prime time for breakfast, and Over Easy proved that with the gaggle of people hanging out outside.  Since I was starving we quickly found another place via Yelp Mobile, and we ended up here.   The patio is cute with tons of shade provided by the greenery.  The inside however is awfully tacky and very poorly put together.  I was embarrassed for the owners just looking at it.  We were told to sit anywhere and we found ourselves at a little two top against the wall.  Service was prompt and we were quickly given our GIANT cups of soda, always a plus for me.  I ordered a dish that had hash browns, 3 eggs any way, bacon, and I subbed biscuits and gravy for the bread.  The amount of food on my plate was massive.  The hash browns took up a whole third of the plate real estate, but that was unfortunate as they were rather tasteless.  They were lacking in the salt/grease/butter department.  Next up, my eggs were overcooked in the yolk part but somehow not cooked enough in the whites.  It was weird, but still edible and not the way I like them.  The bacon... well there was a lot of it.  I thought that was a wonderful thing until I bit into overly fatty bacon that was cooked for way too long.  It was just really salty and crunchy.  For the first time ever, I did not eat all of the bacon in front of me.  The biscuits and gravy was by far the worst part of my meal.  The biscuits were very hard, dry, and flavorless.  It was as if they had been sitting out for at least a few days.  The gravy was pretty bad.  It was completely over-peppered and was super thick and congealed.  It wobbled instead of dripped.  Kind of gross.  When I smothered it on top of the hash browns it was a little bit better.  The husband enjoyed his dish much more than I did mine.  Maybe we will go back some time, but I know what to avoid and how to specify my bacon to be cooked.  For now, it's just a meh.",

    "text": "I took my second visit to Ranch House Grille today for brunch, and I think it was even better than I remembered! I brought two rookies with my, and they both thought that the homey interior made the place so cute and loved the home-style theme of the menu.   The service is wonderful, everyone that works there is so friendly and always have a smile on their face. The coffee is really good, and they are very good about keeping your cup full.   I again had the Light Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast (it is funny that they call it light, because the only light part is that it comes with one egg and a half order of the hashbrowns) but it makes you feel good when ordering! They are known for their Chicken Fried Steak here, and for good reason, it is delicious!! It is nice and tender, with a well seasoned crispy coating and smothered in a peppery white gravy. My two companions had never had Chicken Fried Steak before (which I find hard to believe because I think every elementary school cafeteria had it on the menu!), and they both were pleasantly surprised when they took their tastes. I also upgraded to biscuits and gravy instead of toast, but I could barely make it through half of a biscuit!! They give you two large biscuits and a bowl of their delicious gravy, my mom always makes biscuits and gravy Christmas morning, and while very different from my mom's version, this was very good!   My two companions both had the Eggs Benedict that was the special today. One of them in particular makes it a habit to try Eggs Benedict at every restaurant in town, and she declared this to be an excellent version. She said that the hollandaise was really good, which can make or break the overall dish!   The three of us really enjoyed our meal, and I am thinking we will definitely be back again! They are well known for their Pork Chile Verde, which I have yet to try, but I always seem to get drawn to the Chicken Fried Steak....but maybe next time!",

The portions are huge, the quality of the food high, and the flavors excellent.   Look forward to trying it for breakfast.",

The chicken fried steak is so good it's as if they asked Scotty to beam it straight 'n' steamin' from Texas to your danged ol' plate.  My first bite transported me back to the Lone Star State, but I quickly regained consciousness 'cause I wanted to eat more of it.  Order it slathered in either green chile verde or creamy sausage gravy.  Bein' a Texas boy my vote's on the latter.  Do yourself a huge flavor par'ner -- order it!",

I've eaten here about 5 times and my experience is always the same - mediocre food and slow service.

Patio area is a decent option when the weather is mild and the staff seems like they want you to have a good experience so I'll give this place another try.
