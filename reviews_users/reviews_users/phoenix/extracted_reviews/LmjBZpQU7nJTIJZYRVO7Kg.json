    "text": "Walk into The Counter in downtown Phoenix, and you'll immediately feel welcomed. The restaurant has an upscale diner feel, with a sports television-filled bar, comfy booths and lots of tables for both one-on-one encounters and family outings. I loved the lighting, which was just right at not-too-bright, not-too-dim, and despite the construction currently surrounding the restaurant's streets, it's nice to have a downtown Phoenix view while you nosh.  My pal and I recently dined there and tried a ton of menu items, a great variety for both fans of the build-your-own-burger concept, as well as vegans and vegetarians. We started with fried dill pickle chips ($5), which came with a sweet apricot sauce. I liked the sweet and salty combination, and the pickles were fried to a great consistency, light and not greasy.  We also split a big caprese salad ($7.50), which came with marinated red and green tomatoes, red onion and thick slices of mozzarella. These two items alone would have filled us both up. I loved the green tomatoes, which is a unique touch to the tomatoes you usually get in a caprese salad.  The build your own burger process is the really fun part. Grab a sheet of paper outlining all your burger options, and fill it out, sushi-style. There's a housemade vegan option, as well as bison, turkey, chicken and tuna burgers. Get it with a bun (options include a vegan ciabatta and pretzel bun), or go bowl-style and forgo carbs. There are a dozen cheeses to choose from, 26 sauces to add, and nearly 50 toppings to pile on, including dried cranberries, quinoa and marinated artichokes. Premium toppings include an egg, bacon and chili. Add a side for $3, from shoestring or sweet potato fries, to seasonal grilled corn, and you've got a very filling meal - I couldn't finish a quarter of my burger and crispy onion strings combo after the appetizers.  For my burger, I ordered the vegan patty on a vegan ciabatta bun, with herbed goat cheese spread, house mustard, a lettuce blend, alfalfa sprouts, tomatoes, red onion and dill pickles. Although I added a ton to my burger, everything was portioned well-enough so I could hold it without a problem and cut it in half cleanly. The vegan patty was delicious, and I'd highly recommend my flavor combination if you're looking for a great veggie option. If you're vegan, there is also a vegan cheddar, which really made me appreciate how well The Counter is mindful of all its customers.  You can also build your own salad, or order a burger on their menu in a combination the restaurant has concocted. Besides a full bar, one of the other cool aspects to The Counter is that you can order an adult shake, a sweet treat with your choice of spirit or liqueur. Besides the tasty food and welcoming ambiance, my pal and I thought our service was stellar, especially considering all the things we ordered. We received everything promptly and were checked on diligently, which we were really thankful for.",

    "text": "Finally stopped in with my husband. I wasn't paying much attention to the menu (you know...Friday night brain dead) so I didn't realize the bison burger came on a salad instead of a bun, but it was AWESOME. Really tasty, the salad itself was fresh and had some nice touches, the smoked gouda round on top of the burger was topped with an olive salad and marinated artichokes. I saw later that it was clearly on the Salads page. (Oops, but a happy accident.)  The nutella and salted pretzel shake was a MAJOR disappointment = all pretzel and NO discernible nutella at all. I returned it in favor of the Sweet Peach adult shake, which was very good.  My husband opted for the chili burger which was messy (as a chili burger must be) and delicious. The fries were excellent, and his Thin Mint Shake was delish!  Overall, go there and enjoy. But avoid the nutella and salted pretzel shake.",

    "text": "Today, I ate the most amazing burger in the history of burgers, a burger that any cow would be glad to contribute to. This is not a budget burger -- for the \"under $10 dinner,\" I'm still all about the Smashburger -- but it's a burger worth budgeting for.  My original reasoning was that The Counter is in a really handsome historic building, one that's fascinated me for years. I figured \"custom built burger\" would be like Fuddruckers. No. No. It is \"like Fuddruckers\" only in the sense that a luxury golf course is \"like\" a sparse patch of front lawn or Saks is \"like\" JC Penney.  First and most important, The Counter tackles the concept of \"custom\" with fervor. Your burger can be beef, chicken, tuna, veggie-veggie, and I think a couple of things I forgot. You can have it on a bun of several varieties (including gluten-free) or as a salad. There are SIXTEEN cheese possibilities (including a vegan one) and twenty-six sauces. And that's before you even get to the veggie toppings. If you're innately indecisive, bring some dice to roll for your burger's capabilities. (If you're innately geeky, calculate the permutations and make a chart for working your way through them.)  Second, the burger is jaw-droppingly excellent. I had beef on a whole-grain bun with nicoise olives and spicy pickles, with some form of Italian dressing. The first bite was a revelation. As I got to the last quarter of my burger, I kept delaying because I didn't want it to be over. I like burgers, but I do not ordinarily get this blissed-out over a burger.  Third, there is craft beer. That's almost mandatory in Phoenix these days, but it'd be a loss if it weren't there.  Fourth, the service is outstandingly charming. I love staff who walk the walk on being so good that you'll WANT to tip generously (as I did) rather than discriminating based on stereotypical expectations about tipping.  Fifth, I was so blissed-out by the burger that I gave a thumbs-up to key lime pie on my waiter's suggestion, and it was quite a fine pie. I will now be living on beans and wads of lettuce for the rest of the week, while exercising vigorously, but it was worth it.  Eat here. Bring dice.",

Give these guys some time and I'm sure they'll run a tighter ship before long. I have been here twice and have been happy both times. The people that work here are all very friend and nice. I take onboard that it's pricey, but for $16 I got a 1/3 patty cooked medium rare, the way I like it, with cheddar, bleu cheese, bacon, spinach, grilled onions and sauteed mushrooms with a side of onion strings. The patty was SOLID: fresh and cooked to perfection; all of the extras were of high quality and the onion strings were DELICIOUS.   I thought that they give you plenty of food. Yes, you pay more, but we're talking high quality ingredients, not pre-cooked McDonald's. I can't afford to do this every day but I deserve something like this once or twice a month. I'm really eager to try their milkshakes....and then there's the bar. Again, don't let the negative reviews deter you, this is right up my alley. If you're short on time, give them a few weeks to settle in or go later in the day, not during the lunch rush.",

Basically you fill out a form with checks in boxes to have your sandwich custom made. A lot of good options here: beef, chicken, bison, turkey burger (I think) even a veggie option. Multiple cheese offerings, multiple veggie toppings available. A handful of sides and several bun choices. You can even get your burger in a bowl- bun free. I got 1/3 lb beef on multi grain bun, mixed greens, grilled onions, grilled tomatoes, no cheese. My side is homemade chili. We shall see---",

The lady who answered the phone said the wait was about 15 minutes for 2 but we could put our name on the waitlist over the phone. We showed up and told the hostess our name and of course it wasn't on the list (first bad impression), so we had to wait even longer because we had to now go to the bottom of the list. What made the wait much worse is that all these people were waiting at least 30 minutes outside while half the tables in the restaurant were empty. Some had sat unbussed for the entire time we waited. Being a waitress myself, I would've been more understanding if they were really busy, but they definitely were not. We finally sat down and immediately wanted to leave because of how freezing it was in there. I asked out waiter if they could make it warmer and he said that they \"normally can't\" but he'll ask... Needless to say we sat their shivering the whole time. We ordered two beers, and didn't see those for at least 10-15 minutes later. Our waiter wasn't very attentive. Was forgetful of things we asked for. Our burgers were unfortunately overcooked but the food was decent, overall. The thing that made the experience even worse was the manager. Any manager I have ever worked for has always been concerned with checking on tables and making sure their guests are happy especially on nights when things are clearly going wrong. She stood at the front on her phone and didn't talk to one table. The table across from us took it upon themselves to go to the bar and get their wine, go get the correct dressing for their food, and get their bill paid. Very disappointed in our experience and won't be going back, which is unfortunate because I really like this chain.",

    "text": "Really disappointed. I was part of a large party and the restaurant wasn't crazy busy. The server came by right away when we joined our friends, and that attentiveness was present the whole meal which was nice. The most important aspect of my ahi tuna salad was, of course, the ahi tuna - which was simply butchered. I ordered a full pound ($18) of ahi tuna (plus $4). I thought it would be nice to splurge and even share with anyone who wanted to sample it. When she asked how I would like my tuna, I probably looked confused. Tuna is generally seared and left \"raw\" in the center. I just answered \"seared\" and when she said it might be mostly raw I told her that would be amazing, that's exactly how I like it. She came back again and said the ginger sesame dressing wasn't available, which wasn't a big deal but seems worth mentioning. When everyone's food finally started coming out, mine was among the third wave of dishes. I'm still so disappointed. My tuna was like scrambled eggs, barely raw and diced. It was clumpy and salty, the color of canned tuna and piled on top of a barely there salad with only a couple toppings I ordered and some toppings I didn't. To be honest, I work in the service industry and know I should have simply sent it back and explained the problem. But I just couldn't believe it was served to me in the first place. I ate what I could of it, paid, and left. I tried to make the best of it, because who knows? Maybe that's the way they think it's acceptable to be served. It wasn't worth arguing about it in front of all my friends who were happy with their food. I just can't believe that a restaurant with The Counter's reputation would have served me that slop in the first place - and I'm not one to be overly critical of restaurants or their fare. It should have been done right or not served to me at all.",

The drinks took 15+ min to come and were wrong when they arrived. I ordered a michelada with a salted rim and was given a mimosa with a salted rim. Then, yet again, the server blamed the bartender. The server brought me my drink. HE should know what a michelada looks like compared to an orange bubbly mimosa. My husband's \"bloody pig\" (bloody Mary with bacon) was in a HUGE 24 oz glass...full to the rim with what tasted like v8. There was very little ice and one lonely little piece of bacon floating around in it. Im guessing there must have been 1oz of vodka in there somewhere too although I'm not sure. The server recommended asking them to make it short next time. C'mon. If you're going to throw something like that on the menu, require it's done right from the start. The drink was crap. The $15 bison burger was 4 bites for my husband. Sides must be added for $3 each, no burger or sandwich comes with fries. The place was dead when we stopped in for dinner and it took 40 minutes then get food on the table. My grilled cheese w bacon was all bread with cheese that had already returned to its hard greasy \"been sitting out for a while under the lamp\" stage. I ordered blue cheese on my side salad and it was brought with ranch with blue cheese crumbled added because they \"don't have blue cheese\" Uh, ok. I liked the fried pickles, that's about it and its a cute place. We won't be returning.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for the first time last night, and were really excited because we love burgers and thought this looked like a great place. When we got there, the host inside saw us coming and opened the door for us, promptly guiding us to an empty table.  From there, our waiter was really friendly, and showed us all the deals they were offering, as well as how their menu worked for building your own burger. We thought this was a great option because my boyfriend is picky and always prefers it when he can build his own :)  Unfortunately, I have to give this place two stars, as that was the extent of our good experience. Once we ordered, our food took an extremely long time to be cooked and brought out to our table. We were meeting friends right after dinner, so I was paying close attention to the time. I would have been more understanding had it been really busy, but the restaurant was really only half full.   What was extremely disappointing was the fact that when our burgers finally came out, they were cold! I can handle food that's warm rather than hot, but these weren't even warm anymore, so we couldn't help but feel like they had been sitting in the kitchen for a long time before being brought out. We didn't bother to say anything because we were late for our plans and didn't have time to wait for the food to be reheated or remade, but I wasn't very happy about it.   Otherwise, I could tell the burgers probably would have been really good, so I would want to try it again. I do think it's a bit expensive here, but had the burgers been served hot, it may have been worth it :)",

    "text": "Have had the Impossible Burger in Austin and LA but am happy to finally have it here in PHX. Had it cooked medium, would probably ask for more \"rare\" next time. Our server was severely confused by what \"Vegan\" meant and had to run and ask questions about 7 times (not exaggerating), about what buns and sauces were vegan (after checking she said only the GF bun and ciabatta) she also said the chipotle and horseradish aiolis are vegan, made w Just Mayo. The garlic aioli is not (has buttermilk) After the server asked how the burgers were, she asked if we could tell it's not meat, we told her it's really good/tastes very similar. I asked if she's had the Impossible Burger she said no, then said \"I can always tell if a burger is meat or not because I love meat, like I love McDonald's and I've tried veggie burgers before and they don't taste like meat.\" So I said she really should try the impossible burger I think she'd like it.  I really think the staff needs more education if they are going to serve the impossible burger. I can imagine if that same server was telling an interested Impossible Burger novice she would not have any clue what to say, and likely not make the Impossible Burger sound very good. But for a $74 meal (2 beers, 2 fries, burgers and tip) it would be nice to have someone who knows the menu and doesn't go on about how much better \"real\" meat is as you are eating their non-meat burger.  ***the Impossible Burger itself is delicious!!! This review is for the experience.",

So we get it send back and it comes back fully cooked maybe a little too over Cooked but let me tell u the breeding on that chicken was yummy so crunchy and full of flavor.

    "text": "***LAST UPDATE***  Went to the Counter to give it another shot on Sunday 12/27. We arrived shortly after their opening at 11am and found that they don't open at 11. Apparently the website has not been updated (There are no hour signs on the business) and after looking at reviews, you really should call ahead to find out if they're open or not. Not a problem, we walked around until they eventually opened at 12.  As I was sitting there at our table, I overheard the table behind me asking the server a question. The table was asking if there was a good time to come for lunch because when he stopped by the previous week, they were advised it would be an hour wait to put an order in. I had to chuckle to myself. Based on my previous experience and other reviews, apparently things have not been addressed. I understand the occasional rush that you're not prepared for, but when it is the norm, there is a problem. The server advised the table that they can try on Thursday...lol.  Now the part that counts, how was the food? It was really good! We ordered two burgers, two sides, one adult shake, and one normal shake. Food quality is really good, the cost is high (opinion), but definitely no complaints on taste.   The Counter has been open for long enough to work out the bugs, and hasn't. The novelty of a new place downtown will wear off and unless they address some of the serious shortfalls, I cannot imagine it can survive.   ******  The GM contacted me yesterday and was very pleasant. He explained the situation, explained steps to address it, and convinced me to try it again. Although I still haven't tasted the food, the menu looks great and numerous friends have vouched for the quality of the food.",

    "text": "My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from Los Angeles.  We would frequent The Counter in Marina del Rey and LOVE IT.  So today, November 14, 2015 at 12:45 we wanted try out the one here in Phoenix on Central.  It was the WORST experience I have ever had.  For starters, we sat at the bar and weren't acknowledged for 5 minutes and it wasn't even busy! We finally get acknowledged by Macy who now takes our drink order. I'll be candid, I don't think she wanted to be there, no smile, was complaining, seemed miserable and my husband and I actually witnessed her tell a server, \"I don't think this is what was ordered, but give it to her and if she doesn't like it, I will take it off their bill.\"   So we finally place our order and my husband creates his own burger and I always get the BLT with avocado and extra crispy bacon.  Well our food arrives and it's NOT crispy bacon.  I take it off the sandwich and tell Macy that I asked for crispy bacon and she says \"Oh, I forgot to put that in when I placed the order.  I replied with \"I would like to get what I ordered.\"  So she comes out with a plate of 3 pieces of bacon and apologizes and says \"I'm sorry, they are stingy back there and if I bring more they are going to want me to charge you extra for it.\"  I had this stunning look on my face like are you F-ing kidding me, its your mistake and I would have to pay extra.  Macy said that she took 25% off of our bill, but our bill came out to $30 something dollars and only .30 cents was taken off, but I left it alone and figured I would bring it here to Yelp.  I couldn't believe the customer service that we received.  Clearly the wrong person is behind the bar. She was not sociable and if John Taffer was to ever go their he would rip Macy a new one or even FIRE her. The kicker to this scenario is that before our food came out we witnessed a group of 3 men saying \"It's not even busy in here, what is taking so damn long.\" Turns out these guys came in for lunch on their lunch break and had been waiting for over 10 minutes to get their bill so they could go back to work.  One man finally got up and tracked the waitress down and said, \"we need our check, we have to get back to work.\"  They were clearly upset at the service they received considering the place was empty. One of the men ended up leaving her a note on the receipt, which I don't know what it said, but the waitress clearly thought it was funny!  I can honestly say that management needs to step it up at this location and hopefully will be doing some serious customer service training soon.  I WILL NOT be going back anytime soon and am sad that I can't get my money back for this experience. Oh and I wouldn't recommend  anyone else to go to this location either.",

    "text": "I've been to this place 3 times. Two out of three I didn't get to eat there. Pretty bad odds in my opinion. Make sure you have a back up plan if you do try going.   The first time, they had recently changed their hours and I showed up 15 minutes after the new closing. If you do decide to go here, I highly recommend calling ahead to make sure they will actually be open... That time, I spoke with the manager and he was actually very kind and professional. He offered me a burger on the house the next time. I thought I'd give them a second chance... He said that business was slow in the evenings, that's why they cut the hours. I went back, earlier this time, a couple days later, sat at the bar and enjoyed a great burger and a bananas foster milkshake that was pretty stellar. The bartender was really fun to chat with and service was good.   So I thought they redeemed themselves and the first time was just a fluke and took my friend there for his birthday last night... Problems again. They had a sign handwritten on the door that they were closed til 8 for a private party. But there were people sitting at the bar and the hostess said we could order at the bar. Cool. That's what we wanted to do anyway. There was a couple guys on our right, not part of private party, eating. Another couple on the left put in a food order just as we were deciding on drinks. A different bartender than the last time I was there made my drink then comes and tells us the manager says there will be no food orders for \"a while\". It's 7:12... We ask what time will food be available? The private party has ended early in the meantime and they're clearing out. He says maybe 7:30 or 8, he's not sure.   We were confused and asked to speak to the manager. He didn't logically explain why food couldn't be made, since the private party was done. I asked if the kitchen staff was on break? Nope. Were they out of food? Nope. This \"acting manager\" Javier also refused to provide any reason as to why the people next to us got served and we wouldn't be. The other couple whose order was actually taken canceled their order and decided to leave when we did. I don't know if their food was being cooked or not but the bartender had taken their order and didn't tell them that no food was being cooked so I have a sneaking suspicion if we waited a few more minutes their food would have shown up... That couple said that they had problems when they came here before too and heard other people they know say the same thing.   I felt like the acting manager really didn't care about this place as a business. I asked him if he had any vested interest in the business or if the owner was on premises. He refused to answer. I asked for a business card. He said they don't have those, which I knew was a blatant lie, since I had that incident with the hours of operation the first time I came, the other manager had given me one then with the promise of a burger on the house. I don't even think this manager Javier understood what a vested interest is. An owner manager would have found a way to accommodate patrons rather than alienating them, or at least made a genuine apology and offered something for the inconvenience. We even asked if we could just do a to-go order. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the manager here has any real business knowledge and the customer service skills of a string bean. The rest of the staff seemed to be intimidated and embarrassed by him. If I owned this place, I'd fire him on the spot. He was defensive and stubborn rather than recognizing in the span of 10 minutes he was losing 4 people's business permanently. Who knows how often he acts like this? I'd be willing to bet they have a high turnover rate on staff just from their reaction to what happened too us.    I'm sad to write this review because I actually like the idea of this restaurant but with a stubborn, unprofessional manager at the helm and inconsistent hours of operation, I will not waste my time trying to go there again. I feel bad for the staff there because they were all very nice and much more empathetic than the manager who's the one that is supposed to be setting the example for them.",

I've had a chicken sandwich at Carl's Jr. that was bigger than that for half the price! Also, the music was obnoxiously loud, they have bad acoustics for sound in there, & the songs were quite annoying, too. It was a Friday night, and it was pretty dead in there, we used a Groupon, so we figured this place might be struggling to stay open. I got a shake, and it came in a little glass, when I looked at it I thought to myself...WTF! I also got the sweet potato fries, the portion was decent for those, but it was very salty!!

Then it takes another ten to fifteen minutes to get a server to come around. They never have enough staff. It's very, very frustrating (particularly if you are on a lunch break). This has happened the last three times I have come in, so three stars it is. Get some more staff and I'll come back more often for your delicious food. P.S. no public wifi for customers? really?

Sure enough, these guys didn't disappoint us. Shout out to Jeff who is very courteous and attentive. He knew we were using groupon yet that didn't discourage him. On the contrary, I think they're striving to get better review so they try their best.   Food was great. Got the build it burger with 1/2 lb beef medium and came out perfect- hot and juicy. We also had the sweet potato fries (yummy!), French fries (meh!), and quinoa salad (probably could use a spray of light dressing for taste). They're key lime is tasty too. Apple crumble is a bit dry.",

    "text": "My colleague and I visited The Counter for lunch today (February 3, 2016), as it is conveniently located near our office and we had not yet tried it. We arrived just before noon and were told it would be about 5 minutes before we could be seated. Of course, this was no problem and they seated us shortly thereafter. We placed our order right away and unfortunately, that is when the experience went downhill. It took over an hour from the time that we ordered to get our food. When our food did arrive, the burgers were not prepared properly and they were not even very warm. The waiter only came by one time in the hour we were waiting to see if we needed any refills. Admittedly, we probably should have left and went somewhere else, but we kept thinking that it could not possibly take much longer (we were wrong, obviously).  While we waited, we saw other tables also experiencing ridiculously long wait times. One larger group eventually had to get some of their orders to go, considering most people can only take an hour for lunch. Food was coming out to the same table at different times and customers were very clearly frustrated. The staff half-heartedly apologized for the wait, and blamed the larger group for the delay. However, even with the large group, the restaurant was not filled to capacity, so it was hard to buy that excuse.   I will never return to The Counter, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The food was mediocre at best, and the horrendous service made it a complete waste of time. I cannot possibly imagine how it would take over an hour to get a burger, but The Counter was certainly able to accomplish that.",

I wish however, when you order medium rare, you didn't get too damn rare, or when you order medium rare, you don't get medium. In other words, last time the medium rare was super rare...and the time before the medium rare was almost medium well. Yes, I'm picky. Not my fault...they ASK how you want your burger cooked, and you answer them sincerely...and it's a crap shoot. But the burger and service was better last time....and the meat is high quality and flavorful. Consistency is key, and I'm not unreasonable. Think of a wave pattern with super highs and lows...and one with more shallow waves...people know what to expect in the shallow wave pattern, which is not a perfect line as a goal, which is absolute consistency and not obtainable (except if your Hillstone).

The quality is consistent, the ingredients are fresh and tasty, and they have grilled vegetables as a side instead of fries. It's easy to eat a healthy meal here, which I appreciate.   We found ourselves in downtown Phoenix for a concert at the Comerica Theater and wanted a quick meal before the show (and to avoid paying expensive concession prices for junk food once inside the concert venue). After walking a couple of blocks, we saw The Counter and got really excited. I've only been to The Counter restaurants in California and didn't know they had branched out to Arizona.   It wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately. We told the friendly server the second he came over that we were in a little bit of a hurry because we had a concert to get to. He acknowledged the fact and said he'd be mindful of our time. Well, if that is what he calls mindful, he's sorely mistaken. I swear this guy was slower than a sloth, and he ignored us while chatting up other tables. I love a server who is friendly, but we did inform him of our time constraints. My advice is that if you're in a hurry, don't think you have time to eat here. We had allowed a little over an hour to eat (not counting walking time back to the venue), and by the time he took our order and brought our check, we had very minimal time to actually eat our food. Yes, we probably should've allowed more time, but an hour at a burger joint should be sufficient.  I'm still giving this place four stars because the food was delicious. I just wish the server had been a little more attentive.",

Let me just say, I'm all for a good beef burger and I know The Counter has them.  But I'd looked at the menu before I went and decided I really wanted some tzatziki (sp?) sauce and I thought the turkey burger would get great with that.  I must say, good choice on my part.  It was delicious!  And I know, turkey burgers can sometimes be very dry, but this wasn't.  I also added mixed greens and tomato.  Our only complaint...it did seem to take a while for our server to come take our order.

He ordered a simple vanilla shake and a simple cheeseburger which were perfect for him! He's not a fancy guy, so it was great that hey didn't try to over-do it for him. I ordered the Impossible Burger with LOTS of trimmings and it was DELICIOUS! Tasted, looked and had the texture of real beef! Fries were crispy and fresh for both of us! We will definitely be back!",

Friendly service and we tried their happy hour food. Was surprised that they were having happy hour and closing at the same time. Weird! Anyway, I enjoyed the loaded tots and my friend had the burger sliders with a beer. I wish I could say I enjoyed the loaded tots but I did not. It tasted so plastic, so processed, so gross... The cheese on top was out of some factory and you could sure taste it. The tots themselves just tasted like some frozen crap... Didn't go in with many expectations and left the same way for the most part.",

It is a build your own sandwich kind of place. Choose burger or chicken, size,  bread/roll, toppings, sides, etc. I choose the chicken, 1/3 lb with a couple toppings, and a soda, simple that is all I wanted. About 5 minutes later my lunch arrived, looked pretty good and it was a good chicken sandwich. The total bill was $15 for a chicken sandwich and a soda, a bit over priced for possibly the simplest item on the menu, had I ordered a larger size and a side dish, I would have been in the $20+ range. The venue is very nice and the server, Nick was helpful, friendly and there when I needed a refill on soda. All in all, just an OK as the dollars spent were a bit high for the items eaten.",

The hostess who looked completely stoned, told us they could not seat the empty tables so they wouldn't overwhelm the kitchen. What?! When we finally got seated no one came to our table for easily 15 minutes. We had to ask and was told the hostess never told the waiter she had sat us. By then we filled out our orders and gave to the waiter. We ordered shakes and our burgers. Our shakes took forever to come out and all came out one at a time. When our burgers did arrive they were over cooked and 1/2 the items we included on our forms were not there. The only bright light if you will was the manager who profusely apologized and picked up the cost of our shakes. This place is NOT set up to be a custom burger or shake place. There were only 2 blenders for the shakes and I cannot tell you what was going in with the kitchen. Unless they make some major changes, I would skip this place on your next visit downtown.",

    "text": "First Yelp Review is this new location that opened today 6/8/2015 in Downtown Phoenix by my office.    I have worked in the Food & Beverage Industry in Quick Service, Casual Dining & Fine Dining in Orlando, FL at numerous locations in Walt Disney World.  My Problem with this place is the Owners & Management! You should've had a real Soft Opening as opposed to likely inviting certain people to come in! You have an establishment in the middle of downtown Phoenix with many office buildings that will come to your site for lunch (limited time to eat)- you clearly did not factor this in while planning!  You could have the servers trained on the menu and how to be courteous to guests when they come in, but you should have seen how they AND THE KITCHEN would react when they get busy!  So now you have an opening of your franchise and people saw they can't waste their time at the location!  I walked by this location last week and saw various people inside eating and decided I was going to try it out.  They had two signs indicating they are currently training.  It was not busy but people were eating at various tables  when I walked in and was advised they were not open, but in training.  I did leave a little upset because I thought they were doing a \"Soft Opening\" ( look it up if you do not know what it means - The Management here should have considered this instead of turning people away while training!).  I saw online that they opened today and went to the location on Central Ave at 12:18 and saw it was very busy - which is a great sign!  As I was being walked to my table a manager was talking to a table of 5 or 6 apologizing and even asked about wrapping up the food - think one person did not get their food.  I sat down at my table with two ladies seated next to me with two drinks of water and their bills - I thought they were waiting for the server to cash them out, but the one lady said I would be waiting a while.  The server came to my table and asked \"is this your first time here\" - now as you have read above \"NEW LOCATION THAT OPENED TODAY\".  I informed the server that they just opened today (maybe nerves) he was very courteous and knew the menu which is definitely a good trait to have at a restaurant.  After he left the two ladies let me know that they were on their hour lunch break and ordered at 11:30 and had still not got their food - it was 12:24! they also told me it is a chain - which I could have given the server some credit about asking me if I had been here before, but the problem is this is the ONLY location in Arizona.  I saw two other guests get their food to go at a table against the windows and another 5 top appeared to be waiting a long time as well (theme of the day as there were other tables that looked annoyed and had no food on them) The two ladies left and I asked for my order to go (1/3 beef patty on regular bun (no cheese, veggies, meats, sauces, etc. - just plain with a side of sweet potato fries) since I did not want to be there for an hour for a burger & fries.  The total cost came to $13.00 ( can't remember change was about 0.43 - 0.53 cents) which is quite a bit for a plain burger with fries - I did leave $18.00 since all of the problems WERE NOT the fault of the server.    I walked the food back to my office and who did I run into - the two ladies who had left and they were coming from the cafeteria with lunch and could not believe I was back already WITH my Food in hand.    The Burger was pretty good and the fries were okay - I did have to walk back to my office so not 100% fresh - there are many options and ingredients to put on a burger, but be warned that you could be spending $20.00 for a burger with fries!",

    "text": "I've visited The Counter twice, and won't again.  My first visit I dropped $15 on a burger and fries... plus a tip.  The burger was OK, but there are definitely better burgers in Downtown Phoenix (i.e. 1130 in the AZ Center).  On my second visit I took my daughter for a celebratory milkshake after her music audition.  The shakes were just OK, and pricey.  What's worse, when I looked at my bank statement, the charge was different than I remember approving - with a $6 tip on a $15 purchase!  I like to think I'm a generous tipper, but this was certainly fraud.  I called to resolve the issue, and was asked to come in and talk to a manager.  When I came in one slow afternoon (total of 5 people were eating at the time), I waited to speak with a manager for over 15 minutes - the whole time with a server letting me know every few minutes that the manager would \"be with me in a minute\".  I finally left my business card with a note to call or email me.  I'm not surprised I haven't heard back.  I won't be going back to The Counter anytime soon but not solely because of this bad experience.  Instead of eating overpriced yet mediocre burger and shakes at The Counter, walk across the street to 5 Guys in CityScape or Coney Island on Monroe to save a few bucks for a better burger.",

    "text": "Been wanting to try this spot since it opened and finally go the opportunity today.  Was hoping for a better experience as I live and work downtown.  The food was good but very expensive for what you get.  All sandwiches are al carte so sides are extra.  Plan on spending a minimum of $10 for a burger or chicken sandwich and then another $3 for a side.  The place was busy so I sat at the bar.  I had the BYO (build your own) chicken sandwich.  They didn't tell me I needed to fill out the menu form in order to put my order in.  In fact, I was ignore for the first ten minutes I sat there waiting for someone to acknowledge me.  Once I got my drink, I filled out the order form and then waiting another 5 minutes for the bartender to pick it up and put the order in.  I had to flag him down for this.  My food came out rather quickly and it was good.  The sweet potato fry's where OK but I only got half an order as the server who brought them out spilled half on the floor.  He offered to bring me more but at this point I was running out of time.  The chicken sandwich was good and there are quite a few toppings to choose from on the BYO.  Another pet peeve of mine is when I am not offered a refill on my drink.  My water glass was empty for half the meal and the bartender never acknowledged or even asked if I needed anything else. I attempted to get his attention but was ignored.  I also had to ask another server to ring up the check as the bartender also failed to pick up my bill and credit card which was laying in plain view.  After tax and tip, the bill was over $16 dollars (and I only drank water)   I believe there are better value restaurants in the downtown area with better food and lower prices and much better service.",

The hostess explanation for all the empty tables and 20 min wait to be seated was that a large party arrived and they couldn't keep up in the kitchen.  So, the restaurant has the space but not the ability to serve a  full house?  That is clearly a problem already. Then the food took forever and to top it off terrible. The \"well\" burger was burnt! I mean black burnt. The \"medium\" was over cooked and dry. And don't bother  with the dessert.

We would have ordered more drinks, but we were never checked on again. They never brought out two sides that were ordered.

Instead of starting off our evening on a good note, The Counter actually exhausted and frustrated us to the point that we all went home.

It was a good burger, big (probably half a pound) and cooked the way I asked, piled high with lettuce/tomato/mushrooms/mini-onion-rings. Large quantity of good shoestring fries served in a paper lined metal cup.  I had an Arnold Palmer lemonade (or is that Arnold Palmer iced tea?) which was only so-so, though the free refill meant I got hydrated. I came away comfortably full, but still questioning the value. It's a downtown place, what can I say. If you're on an expense account, and not per-diem, and want to sock it to your company while innocently telling whoever doesn't look at your expense report that you just had a burger for lunch, this is the place. Yep, I'm that petty, I can't enjoy a burger meal at $25 after tip. Maybe you can.",

    "text": "First time in Phoenix Arizona and I decided to take a walk about downtown.  The vibe is hipster and business, makes sense with the presence of ASU & major executive buildings, city hall and the convention center all centralized, you can tell who comes where from the way they appear.  I was coming in from Mesa and wanted to do a little sight seeing.   As I stepped off the LightRail subway, immediately you can feel the beefy of the people, like a tiny dose of Chicago or New York - lets throw in Los Angeles in the mix too.  student bristling past me along with office people from different work backgrounds and all I could do in my laid back Hawaiian style swagger was watch it all and soak it in.  I could smell all the wonderful eateries wafting in the air as I took pics of all the wonderful architecture of tall statuesque building with wonderful details to add to their monumental stature.  I just happen to walk by The Counter, the aroma emitted from this corner eatery was very inviting. I'm a very meat eating carnivore that loves steaks and burgers!  Automatically after walking around, I was very much into trying out this gem!  I walked in and Mick, the bartender immediately greeted me, just as he continued to do so with every other customer after me.  He was quick to ask me if I wanted a drink - PBR BABY! Yes, I'm a little ghetto - and it was served in a can which I prefer!  I was half distracted to do some social media when Mick showed me how to create my own burger. So, many choices but all sounded delicious.  I placed my order and not even 15 minutes, my order was brought out, fresh and hot. The only thing was the chef forgot my sun dried tomatoes. That is forgivable.   After my first bite, it truly didn't need it, my eyes were bigger than my palette in this situation.  Mick offered some small talk, I applaud is genuine interest in his guests and actually gave me some great insight on where else I could go to enjoy some good music while I'm here.  The food is affordable, it's also a fairly new place open around a year now.  I would recommend anyone to come and visit, the burgers are cooked to your liking (side note: I love my burger rare - and it was cooked perfectly! Seared and flavorful with the creaminess of avocado, pickles, and a roasted garlic aoli!  My side was expertly crispy fried sweet potato fries which I could not finish because my burger was gargantuan!  If in Phoenix, check it out and at least have lunch and cocktails there!  Welcome to Phoenix, AZ!  :)",

As he was mixing up a shake (for another order), I asked him about it, he immediately gave me a sample of the amazing banana split shake. The service was quick and great.

We ordered the fires which had great texture and the sliders, after the waiter gave us a great recommendation on how to have the burgers prepared.  We also got a couple of their handcrafted shakes.  I wasn't overly impressed with the shakes, but I think I'm more of a Frosty fan anyway.  They did have a good selection of shakes to try from and a build your own option.  Tip though, order the small shake, it's a good size and not that much smaller than the large.  The only real downside to this place is the price.  I wish you'd get a little more for what you pay for.  All in all though, the food is good and the atmosphere is pretty unique for being in the center of Phx.",

I've read that service has been bad for a lot of people, but I didn't have that experience at all. Maybe it just happens when it is super busy.  I shared the fried dill pickles with apricot sauce.... and it was so good! That sauce was great and I used the remaining on my burger. I ended up getting the Official Counter Burger. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The mushrooms and onions strings were good. The beef was cooked the way I like it as well. However, the bun was just too buttery for me. It overpowered the taste of anything else. I like when buns are buttered, but this was too much. I wish I had a chance to get a shake or malt, because that part of the menu looked amazing. Maybe next time. I'd say it's worth another shot with a different type of burger and some dessert.",

A meatless burger made of plants, but tastes and bleeds like a real meat burger.  All Counter locations now offer them.  There's been a lot of hype around this burger, and after trying it, was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  If I didn't know what the burger was, I would not have guessed it wasn't a beef burger.  If anything, I may have thought the burger was made of a very lean beef, as it can fall apart a bit, which I have experienced with regular beef burgers in the past.    But otherwise, it was a great burger.  One thing interesting about this burger, during cooking it creates a bit of a crust around the burger, which tastes awesome!  The Counter may want to take advantage of this crust for other recipes or offerings.  In any case, if you've never been to The Counter, or if it's been a while... now's a great time to go back and try out the new Impossible Burger!",

The server was super nice about getting my burger cooked right, but unfortunately the second time was still mooing. It seemed my version of med-rare was different from theirs, which unfortunately led to a poor experience for me. Sorry Bessie, The Counter didn't do you any justice today",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me here for lunch during the workweek. The food isn't mind-blowing, but it's good.   Parking here isn't awful, but you may have to travel around the block to find street parking. I parked in the underground parking lot at 1st, before Central.   The restaurant itself has a diner-esque feel. It made me want a milkshake. There were a lot of attorneys in the restaurant, which makes sense because the restaurant is situated in the middle of all the law office buildings, and is close to the courthouses.   Service: We were greeted immediately after we walked into the restaurant. Both the person who sat us at our table and our server were keen to help us decide on lunch. This was our first time here, so they took the time to explain the menu and how we could order a speciality burger, or create our own burger. They were attentive, but not overbearing.   Food: My boyfriend customized a bison burger - 1/3 lb. organic patty with brie, kale, and a couple other items. I got the $11 lunch combo with the Old Fashioned burger (tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese) and a side of sweet potato fries. The burgers were surprisingly really good. They were both on brioche buns that were flavourful and delightfully chewy. The bison was delicious. My Old Fashioned burger was exactly what I expect out of a good burger. I'd probably try customizing a burger next time though.   The sweet potato fries were pretty underwhelming. They were slightly warm at best, under-seasoned, and limp. I wouldn't order those again, and that makes me sad because I like sweet potato fries. A lot.   With so many choices for lunch in the area, I don't know when I'll be back here again. For people who want a quick and filing meal, I'd recommend The Counter.",

I heard nothing but praise all around the table and as for my own, everything so super yummy. Decent sized margarita and good-sized burger for what I paid. The fries were delicious and salted (both regular potato and sweet potato) and tasted good with any of the dipping sauces we had at the table. Two girls split the Nutella Salted Caramel shake and said it was very tasty (a bit clumpy because of the pretzels in it). Service was relatively quick and the wait staff was very pleasant.",

    "text": "What's a downtown without a good custom burger place?  The Counter, conveniently located just next to the Light Rail station and across from several major hotels, is a great option for lunch or dinner.  A nice selection of burgers from the traditional beef to bison to turkey, with every topping you would come to expect from a custom burger place.  I'd highly recommend the bison burger, topped with a sunny side up egg, Gouda, and a side of Thousand Island dressing.  I'm also a huge fan of partaking in local beers (when in Rome).  There's nothing more disappointing than traveling to a new state and not being able to fully immerse yourself in the local experience, which includes local food and drink.  Fortunately, this place offers a couple beers from local breweries including 805 and SanTan.  The SanTan IPA is a good choice, and pairs well with the bison burger.  By the way, everything is a la carte, so don't expect fries with your burger or you'll be disappointed.  It's not a cheap place to eat, but most of the time you get what you pay for.",

He was attentive, personable, and informative. Just enough chit chat to make you feel like you know him! Food was a teeny bit slow, but it's a Friday night, and we ordered like all the odd things, and it's not fair of me to say it wasn't ok. It was just fine. Any burger at the Counter is fantastic, and you know you will get your fill and your money's worth.  The restaurant was clean, and the staff was generally happy.

As we walked in, the gentleman behind the counter welcomed us. He asked us how we were doing and said to pick any seat we liked. He explained that they had service on the patio as well. We found our perfect table and sat down. Within minutes our server came over. His name was Jeffery. He asked if we had been here before. We explained that we came in to try the new Impossible Burger. He said he was excited for us to try it and said we would love it. He immediately took our drink order and suggested appetizers for us. He came back to chat while our appetizers were being prepared. He was telling us how they are one of the few places that offer the Impossible Burger in Arizona. He said lots of people were coming in to try it. Our appetizers came out just a few minutes later. They were hot and delicious. Jeffery came back and gave us drink refills and asked how we liked the appetizers. He was very attentive.   As we were finishing, our burgers came out. They were presented nicely on the plate. They smelled wonderful and tasted amazing. They have average portion sizes. Not to big and not to small.  I highly suggest you check this place out and ask for Jeffery, he will take great care of you.",

To our dismay over the past couple of weeks, the food is mediocre and the service has declined considerably.  Not sure what's going on with this place, we figured maybe the quality control person quit.  Today's experience was the worst.  Our waiter mostly ignored us and our 'create your own' wishes.  He did not tell us the Loaded Spuds which we love would come without bacon, as they were out of it...loaded spuds NOT good without the bacon.  On that note, the manager decided to comp the spuds...good call, we might give you one last chance.  They used to split the burger for us when we share, today we had to cut our own burger in half.  One person missing their 'custom' sauce order and another missing their 'custom' grilled onions, took 5 minutes for the waiter to come back to the area where we had to stand and yell to get his attention...waving our arms around in spasm did not work.  Another guest missing the chicken she ordered with the Caesar salad. All problems were quickly remedied, but it felt like the server hated us by now.  What is going on Counter burger?  You won't last six months in the downtown area, if you don't fix these quality issues.  We've seen it before in the downtown area.  Your prices dictate the quality that should be given, if you plan to stay in business very long.  There are just too many choices around here.",

Pros: burger options are pretty much endless -other options besides just a burger -great fries & milkshakes  Cons: burgers come out extremely undercooked (I was warned of this prior to ordering from a friend). I like my meat well-done so I made sure to make note that I wanted mine well done, it was medium-well at best. The outsides were cooked but the entire inside was pink & bloody. I was also missing many of the toppings I opted for with the \"build your own burger\". My waiter did notice that I was displeased and had the manager come over to try and make things right.   (Note:they have a chart on their menu of the different options on how to order the burger with descriptions of how much or little pink it should have. Making it less debatable on how the burger should or should not look.)  It primarily seems to be an issue with the kitchen staff and proper cooking temperatures & attention to details.",

Only downside imo is location. Parking is a bit tough, but don't let that deter you. Check it out and tell them Chris sent you.  Ok, don't tell them that. They probably have no idea who I am.",

Yes the food is mediocre but for the price I would honestly waste my money on fuddruckers famous hamburgers (where you can actually make your own burger and pile on as much pickles, tomatoes, jalapenos, etc). The meat was a bit hard to chew on. Fries on the other hand were exceptionally good. But a $40 check for just 2 burgers and fries is too much.

The Counter was convenient walking distance from our hotel and to the concert venue so we went here before the show. I usually go to The Counter on trips home to the OC. It's always a place I can get something to eat when I'm with the meat-eaters in my life. I pretty much always get the same thing: a veggie burger with caramelized red onions, roasted red peppers, and avocado with a side of barbecue sauce on a ciabatta roll. I love their shoestring fries and sweet potato fries equally. It's always a toss up which to get but if you get the big side order to share, you can go 50/50. It's become easier to order at The Counter, as they are clearly marking all the vegan options now. I do wish they had a regular bun that was vegan because the ciabatta roll is a little tougher and the veggie patty usually crumbles as you're eating it. I know they are house-made, but I think the patty recipe could be tweaked a little bit to not fall apart so much. They are tasty nonetheless but it makes for a messy burger!",

We both ordered the Bacon BBQ burger, chili cheese fries, a side order of regular and sweet potato fries as well. Our burgers came out before of chili cheese fries which was fine, but with the amount of fries in that bowl, we definitely expected MORE toppings, so that was a fail. Our burgers were too over cooked eventhough we asked for medium rare but I guess burger places just can't make it medium rare anymore, only thing I really loved about the burger was the BBQ sauce, which was on the side, oddly and the onion rings in it. Our side order of fries actually tasted better than the chili cheese one, guess you can't really go wrong with just fries though.  Ultimately we weren't big fans of this place, definitely over priced for what we got.",

    "text": "The Counter is so conveniently located, it's hard not to pass by without thinking of stopping in for a bite to eat. That's why I've been back twice since my first visit (when I couldn't get take out - but we won't speak of that again).  For my second visit, I dined-in and sat at the bar. Thought I chose a good spot, but folks still bumped me as they passed behind. Next time - table only.   The couple next to me was sharing a burger and side. Not sure if it filled their bellies, but they seemed to enjoy every bite. On my other side someone ordered a grilled cheese without side. Looked a bit skimpy, so I can't imagine how filling that could have been.  Every dish coming out of the kitchen looked yummy. The burgers were stacked and even though I'm not much of a flesh eater, I was thinking \"dayum, me want burger.\"  Anyway, reality. Like I said in my first review: I would be the idiot who went all veggie on 'em. So my build-your-own-burger sans burger turned out to be a bowl of salad. With a side order of yam fries without question.  I was impressed with the salad - very fresh, very crisp, very green, very good. And the yam fries were tasty. Salted, not sweeted like other restaurants are serving them. The contrast of sweet to salty flavor was excellent and the fries accompanied my salad con mucho harmony.   Tongue was happy, tummy be happy, me happy.  For my third visit I had a jones for yam fries! or sweet pos as some folk calls 'em. I ordered take out. Decided on the build-your-own-grilled cheese. Requested all kinds of fixin's.   In my head, i pictured the guys in the kitchen stuffing topping after topping between slices of bread and wrapping up a fat sammich for me - just like the fat burgers they serve. Nope, wrong answer. My grilled cheese was still on the skimpy side, though not as skimped as the grilled cheese the woman had during my second visit.   When I got to my destination, I added two more toppings of my own. Don't get me wrong, it was a good sandwich, but nothing ticks me off more than having to re-dress something that was build-your-own in the first place.   Tsk, tsk. Sweet pos were a total failure. I ate them straight from the box, but they tasted like the kitchen had either re-warmed them or twice fried (overcooked) them.  Smh. What does disappointment mean?  noun - the feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfillment of one's hopes or expectations.  My jones was gone's.",

    "text": "I was staying across the street at the Renaissance hotel for one night, and I was looking for someplace close by to eat. It's tough to be closer than The Counter, so I gave it a shot.  The food was excellent. They have this massive menu of options for building a burger, including gluten free buns or a no-bun burger bowl option (which I selected). Pick a meat, a cheese, unlimited cool toppings (I went with things like jicama, grilled onions, cucumbers, pickles and jalapenos) and a sauce. I also added a side of sweet potato fries. Both the burger bowl and the fries were very tasty.   After eating, I decided to have an adult milkshake. Again, you can pick one of their options or build your own, so I went with chocolate sauce, peanut butter and chocolate chips with Kahlua (good choices, me!). I appreciated that I could get a not-so-huge 12 ounce shake, too (16 ounces would have been more than I needed, though it was an option).  I sat at the bar, in part so I could watch a football game, and the bartender / server was super friendly and helpful the whole time. Keep in mind that I was there at 5:30 on a Thursday, so it wasn't crowded at all, but still, their service was great.  Big thumbs up from me! Burgers and boozy shakes... yum.",

We watched everyone who sat down after us leaving as our food finally came. At this point we were beyond hunger and scarfed down the food. We were so upset about the service I couldn't tell you how the food was but good luck on your service.",

Naturally, there are headaches to be expected with a brand new establishment but the entire experience was chaotic. We were \"helped\" by no less than four different servers. Somehow they forgot to put our orders in and lost mine completely. Kudos to the manager for comping our meal but somehow that still does not seem like enough. The burger I received had very few of the items I selected, was cooked well beyond what I asked and I received the incorrect fries.   This place has a lot of potential being amidst so many office buildings and right off the light rail but they really need to be more organized. It's going to be awhile before I feel like trying this place again.",

One thing I did learn is that I hate blue cheese. It was in my sandwich and oh my god I wanted to cry. But I just took out the blue cheese and the sandwich is good afterwards. Let me talk about the Starters we had....they were delicious. It was nothing fancy but it was so good! We had sweet potato fries and onion strings. The sauces they gave for the fries and strings were what made it so delicious. If there's one thing I would go back for it would be the fries and strings....silly, i know. But overall this place is great. We went on a Friday night half an hours before closing and the staff were really nice, it wasn't busy at all ( because it was close to closing time), and me and family enjoyed our meal and drinks.",

Pick from already created menu options or build your own burger with a multitude of selections (there were seriously 10 assortments of buns, just buns). I got the Bison is Gouda  burger cooked medium well. The middle was a light pink cooked perfect and the flavor was great. Their regular burger comes in a 1/3lb patty, I could only eat half. Also ordered a casa margarita to go with it and it was delicious. My friend got the Beef and Blue burger, which looked delicious as well and the danish blue cheese had great flavor.

About as good as Applebee's   The shoestring fries and ketchup were absolutely disgusting.  The fries tasted literally like shoestrings. But that is not the worst of it.   We had to wait to be seated on a Wed.  The lunch crowd was already clearing, so being busy was not the issue.  Once we were finally seated after waiting about 10 minutes, we had not one but two waitresses.  You would think the service would be good. Wrong.    The two waitresses who waited our table were rude, inattentive, uncaring, and would walk away before you finish making your request, and failed to check up on us.  They acted like they wanted to be anywhere but there.    Then they screwed up the bill, and gave me someone else's.    Yeah, it was SUCH A BOTHER to the waitress to get me the correct bill.  I could hear the sigh and the eyeroll from across the restaurant.  The 20-something, eye-rolling, snotty, stuck up girls' service was so bad, I didn't tip them, and I didn't even feel bad about it, either.    Hey The Counter, hire better wait staff.    Oh, and I am not sure how you screw up fries, but get a better supplier, get a better cook, or BOTH!",

    "text": "Walked to The Counter cityscape between meetings to place an order to go. The line to be seated was long and to go bags lined the front counter by the hostess stand. I sat at the bar as I ordered a bowl of chilli and waited with a friend. Bartender gave me my tab right away. I didn't ask for water but none was offered. Seemed like the bartender was working the bar and the floor at the time. 10 minutes later I received my bag and proceeded to leave. The bag was unstable so I looked in before I left and noticed my chilli was in a venti size plastic cup. I went to the bartender, pulled the cup out the bag and asked if they meant to put my hot chilli in this plastic cup?! While showing her the cup, the lid popped off! She responded, \"yes, we're all out of to go containers sooorrrry.\" I asked her if there was anything else at all and she repeated , \"Nooooo , we're all out of everything, soooorrryyy.\" Sounding super sympathetic.  I left and headed back to the office as the lid popped off multiple times during my walk.  I had a conference call right when I got back so my chilli sat for 30 minutes. When I was ready to eat, I needed to heat it up and it just didn't feel right sticking a plastic cup in the microwave. My office is \"Green\" so we don't supply paper plates, bowls, utensils, straws etc... so I proceeded to go from desk to desk harassing my co-workers for a bowl. Although everyone thought my plastic cup of chilli was questionable and SO hilarious, I got a bowl and finally had lunch  Such a weird situation   ******UPDATE***** Updating review from 2 stars to 4 mostly because of how responsive, understandable and quickly my experience was addressed and handled. Customer Service reaches out for more information and clarity, the manager was contacted and notified and I was offered a $15 gift card to give them another chance. This was an amazing gesture and I was treated like a valued customer. I picked up the gift card but didn't use it in time because I travel often and work from home so not downtown to often. But regardless, this makes a huge difference in my experience and how I will recommend this location going forward.  Thank you, Love",

    "text": "Well we were regular customers, appalled at the visit and service today. First the hostess was not very friendly and could not be found even though 2 groups of people were waiting to be seated. Restaurant was less than 1/4 full, we asked for a booth and 7 were open with all 7 dirty. They cleaned one and seated us (after acting put out that we asked for a booth). We finally walked out after waiting 10 minutes to get a drink order in. We asked to speak to the manager and one of the servers came over and said he was the manager. At this point him and everyone else \"working\" had zero sense of urgency so we left, and won't be back. In the 15 minutes we were there 8 dirty tables remained while the staff was huddled up talking. It's a shame we frequent the Counter often in PHX and Marina Del Rey. Both bathrooms also had trash cans overflowing and no paper towels.",

From your meat, to bun, to veggies, and condiments, each burger is made to order.  We each went with Impossible burgers and added options to our hearts content (vegan cheese and mayo offered too!).  While a bit pricey, we've found all locations that serve the Impossible patty to be comparable in price and this location was no different.  I recommend checking it out but keep in mind this area is limited to meter parking.",

It may be a bit too intense for those that cringe at the idea of meat, but it was pretty good. The Counter is also sensitive to cross contamination and cook it in a separate grill.   You need to inquire about what bread and toppings are vegan, but the servers can bring out a list. They don't have any vegan cheeses.  We got ours with sides of shoestring and sweet potato fries - both are great so it was hard to choose.   They have a veggie club and salads that can be made vegan too. I've heard the non-vegan burgers are good too but can't personally confirm.  Service was fast,friendly and accurate. If you sit by the window you get to see (and feel) light rail trains go by. They also have a nice patio out back for when the weather is agreeable.",

    "text": "Location is nice. Only a 5 blocks walk from the Sheraton. However if you near the trolly line. It has a stop on their door steps which is a huge plus for tourist like my self. This Restaurant seems very hip and trendy. Both the waitress and the host that helped me to be seated and take my order are super friendly and helpful. With the recommendation of my waitress. She gave me three suggestions of her favorite burgers. I narrowed it to two of them and let her decide for me. She chose the breakfast burger. As for sides she recommended the onion strings or the tots and again I let her decide. So tots it is. After questioning how fresh the beef is. I decided again on her recommendation to go with rare as she assured me it's super high quality and always fresh.   They have a full bar and two good size tv's displaying two different channel's. I was alittle sadden to hear they only have 2 local beers on draft. The first suggestion was the moon juice as it is local and very populer. So I'm giving them a shot as well. Options are 16 or 20oz. For me the moon juice is a little too citrus but it's drinkable.   Upon arriving I was immediately seated and offered the DIY selection to make the burger of my dreams. Trust me. The list is huge for selections if you want to make a crazy Kitchen Sink Burger. Then I'd suggest you take that list and build your own mountain. For me I want to go with a staple on the menu. But to each their own.   As for the presentation. The plate was not cleaned by the expiditer so it has random food marks on the top and bottom of the plate. A simple wipe down. Would have stepped up the presentation.  The tots are fried a little hard and are defiantly not much different that store bought. (Update the waitress could tell they were not right and took them off the bill without me asking. Which I did eat about 5 of them so I would have paid for them bit I'm changing my review based on this small gesture of great service.)  So here is the down and dirty. What this place lacks in presentation it makes up for in burger flavor. In short. I'm giving 4 stars based on everything over all. But truth is the service and what I came for... the BURGER.... are both 5 stars. I would suggest this place to anyone who is a burger fan and though I'm only here for a few days. I just may come back.  Update (I'm gonna go ahead and say 5 stars as the service and burger flavor are both 5. The presentation was a little disappointing as were the tots. However. I came here for a burger and got what I wanted plus great service. So 4.7 stars is my review. Round up to 5. Yes I would suggest if your a burger lover you should come here and try what they offer.   Good luck and good eats.",

The place was nearly empty,  but it took forever to get our food. It felt like over 30 minutes. My son ordered a milkshake and it took over 15 minutes just to get that. After we got our food, we were pretty much ignored. When I discovered they had forgotten to put bacon on my burger,  I had finished half of it before I saw the server again to explain the error.   Hidden charges: the server encouraged us to choose different sauces \"they all come on the side,  so you're not committed. You can choose a bunch.\" Um, they charge for every side after your first. I ordered one with my burger,  but meant as a side for my fries and I was charged. Also: they charge for drink refills (at least for lemonade). They don't tell you that when they ask if you want a refill.   Mistakes: they forgot the bacon on my burger. When they finally (I was done eating at that point) brought out a side of bacon,  half of it was burnt and inedible  (see pic).  Overall: great burgers,  but disorganization, poor service and insane prices make this a no return place for me.",

This is a great place if you like burgers.  This is an even greater place if you like to have your touch on your burgers.  The options for what you can do to a burger will blow your mind.  They are many and interesting and intriguing.    I have each time cast my fate to the whim of my pencil on their order form and it has not failed yet.  Why?  Because the basis of any burger combination I make is their wonderful burger patties.  They absolutely know how to cook a burger.  It comes out consistently juicy and flavorful each and every time.  My only complaint with this spot is its inconsistent service.  In the beginning we chalked up the long wait times and delayed service to just opening and the early crowds.  now, it still is inconsistent at times when there are fewer people.  There must be something in the masterful cooking process that means the kitchen will be slow and inconsistent.  I have decided that the wonderful burger is not yet offset by the slow and irregular service.  Though I have to admit, recently a group of three of us went at 11:20 AM, saw many empty tables and were told we would have to wait 10 minutes because they had just sat a party of 12 on the patio.  Man - week day lunch hours should be your bread and butter and you should be able to handle what comes.  Considering the historically irregular service we had pass and kept walking until another spot around the corner sat us immediately.  From what my peers are saying, dinner crowd is much thinner and service is better than at lunch.  Last hint - I eat my burgers in a bed of greens.  Kind of like a burger salad.  Nice way to avoid the carbs.  It is my go to meal at The Counter.",

Server was quick to take our drink orders and friendly. Within a few minutes, everyone ordered their food, in which we clarified to have the bill split per person (there was 6 of us).  I ordered the custom 1/3 lb chicken breast burger with Multigrain bread, Jalapeno Jack cheese, Chipotle Aioli, lettuce/tomatoes, and side of Coleslaw. Within 15 minutes, everyone's food came out at the same time and the burgers looked and smelled great!  For those of you who enjoys a good quality burger and may be picky with the sort of specific toppings to include in your meal, I would definitely recommend for you to try this place out. Keep in mind that lunch time may get quite busy.",

    "text": "AMAZING GLUTEN-FREE BURGERS! We were Downtown and needed to find a new and yummy place for lunch. What makes The Counter stand out is their QUALITY meats and LARGE topping selection. They have a special menu for burgers that come with a GLUTEN-FREE BUN or on FRESH GREENS. You can also BUILD YOUR OWN gluten-free burger!   I, of course, had to build my own burger! What's really unique about this restaurant is that you're able to PICK THE SIZE (there are 3 options:  lb,  1/2 lb, or 1 lb). I love having those choices because if you can't eat a full pound, you can opt for a smaller size to fit your appetite! There are also PLENTY of topping choices. I went with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and avocado! My date got provolone, lettuce, jalapenos, grilled pineapple, and scallions! You also have several side choices: I got veggie skewers and my date got shoestring fries!  Our waitress was so NICE and PATIENT with us considering we took a while to write in our order. We started off with a banana shake to split. The ice cream was very thick and the banana taste was extremely distinct. When the food did come out, the meat was fresh and juicy! You can also select how rare or well-done you want the meat to be cooked! Ours was grilled PERFECTLY to our preferences. The vegetables skewers were richly season which made them pop!  Overall, we had such a GREAT experience at The Counter. You have so many options and customizations, it makes the place INNOVATIVE. I just love the VARIETY and VERSATILITY of the menu! Also, the gluten-free buns were DELICIOUS! I'm definitely going to be back to try different burger styles and maybe something in their summer special menu.",

While this is nice, it didn't make up for a few flaws. First the beef burger was very greasy. It was honestly too much and ruined the flavor of the entire burger. The turkey burger was begged, but also too dry. Fries do not come with any of the burgers so you must order those for an additional price. The fries were shoestring style. They were pretty crispy but a little too salty. One order was enough to share. The service was pretty good, the waitress didn't bother us too much. Overall the burgers were just okay. I think everything was a little over priced for a burger. And I just couldn't get over the greasiness of the beef burger, I would not recommend it. I would possibly be willing to give it another try and order a different type of burger.",

They have seating space of all kinds and we were seated promptly.   However, it sort of went downhill from there. Our server was nice and apologetic but our food took forever. Both milkshakes and food were staggered in arrival time for our group of four despite us all ordering at the same time. If it was a normal lunch break, we literally would have had to leave because it was so drawn out. I was surprised we were there for 90 minutes when the restaurant didn't even appear busy. There was plenty of open seating.   When our food finally did arrive, my order was partially wrong. A friend was disappointed by the fact that they have about two dozen sauces, but no blue cheese for the wings on their menu. Food was nice, I suppose, but not worth the wait. I think it tasted good because we were all starving.   The prices were also higher than I would consider reasonable for comparable food in the area. I was excited to try the impossible burger (tastes exactly like meat) but the $5.50 upcharge for it was steep.  They have alcoholic milkshakes, which is a fun concept, but the options are limited. Also, I tried to use the yelp deal for a free side, but the server put my bill in wrong, which ended up taking us even longer.  It wasn't awful but we wouldn't voluntarily return.",

Even additional sauces cost more like come on, ranch should be included when you're paying for a burger and fries (yes, the fries are additional as well).   The sweet potato fries I ordered were good, super crispy which I liked and a good amount of flavor.   Tried the s'mores shake and wasn't impressed. It just tasted like whipped cream, which I hate. I want a milkshake to be ice cream, not whipped cream.   Overall it was ok but nothing to rave about.",

    "text": "Do you hear complaints about how there's no good place to eat downtown? Well let me counter that by saying you should go to The Counter!  If you're looking for someplace to eat before seeing a show at Comerica Theater The Counter is a good choice. It's within walking distance with fast casual food on the menu. They have a build your own burger option, as well as preset options for burgers, salads, and various sides. I saw that they offered the Impossible Burger so I had to try their version! I had it as a build your own burger, and I liked how you have the option to have your burger on top of greens instead of a bun. The options for proteins are plentiful, and you can choose which size burger you want for your meal. There are multiple options for greens too, including kale and spring mix. I opted for spring mix, with fresh mozzarella, roasted grape tomatoes, fresh chopped tomatoes, carrot strings, grilled red onions, hard boiled egg, roasted red peppers, pineapple and sesame ginger vinaigrette.  The Impossible Burger was very good! It was cooked very nicely with a crisp browned outside and tender faux meat, cooked \"medium rare\" to order. It had a little bit too much salt on it for me, but I'm salt sensitive so others might feel differently.  The other ingredients were fresh and generously portioned. They went well with the burger. I liked that the dressing comes on the side so you can add as much or as little as you want. It's truly a custom food experience tailored just for you!  I also had a peach mint Fresca. It was fruity, tart and fizzy. They add fresh mint in the soda but I couldn't taste too much of it in the drink. Maybe it needed to be muddled more. I also couldn't taste a lot of peach flavor, mainly the citrusy Fresca and lime that is also in the drink. It was still an enjoyable beverage though.  The total ended up being somewhat pricey, with the burger and greens costing around $16. The ingredients are very high quality though and you get a lot for your money.  Overall it's not a bad choice if you want a casual meal in the downtown area.",

I know the Impossible burger comes with a higher price tag than beef, but an Impossible with basic toppings came to $17 without any sides. Add sides for another $3-4 each. Sigh. Also, I do not dig the shoestring fries trend.   Don't get me wrong - there are some definite pros. There are a ton of choices. Meat, veggie, even vegans can eat well here. Also, major props for giving a choice on cooking temperature of the Impossible. So many places overcook them into a hockey puck, but here you can get them pink. They seem to have a good drink menu, too. It was lunch, so I tried a spritzer of lemonade-soda water, which was refreshing, but again, even that had the wow factor of the wallet - it was $4, mostly ice, and didn't come with refills. Oof.  It's a fun place and the service was very nice, but I wouldn't become a regular over the exorbitant price tag.",

The place is nicely remodeled Inside, very clean and cool vibe. It seemed that burgers are what they are famous for so of course we ordered burgers. I got the bacon burger and my partner got the impossible burger. We shared a side of fries. Burgers are thick and juicy, you can taste the freshness of the ingredients and the soft bun with butter. Delicious!! But the best part was our server Lorenzo, who was very patient while we made our choices, and took the time to explain what each burger was known for, gave us suggestions for appetizers and even took my \"free side\" Yelp coupon and applied it towards our appetizer!! Amazing service! We will definitely come back and try other items on the menu, everything looks great. Not your typical dinner for sure!",

I was informed several days ago after writing this review, by a representative of the business, that significant changes have been made to improve their service and quality.)  We spend a fair amount of time walking and discovering bustling downtown Phoenix.  And at the corner of Adams and Central avenue, butted up against the light rail station, lies The Counter. Billed as a premier burger establishment; this place has beckoned to us for too long.  We endeavored to give it a try, and had high hopes that it would deliver an appetizing burger dining experience.  Not so!  For starters, even though it was pretty much empty on a weekday, the service was very slow. A snail's pace had more aplomb than this place.  I won't even bore you with the particulars of our visit. Needless to say, spending $40+ here for two hamburgers, sides, and drinks was a complete and utter waste of both our time and money.   The burgers were so bland, and uninspired. The fries couldn't even elevate themselves to the mediocrity that Sonic serves - which isn't even remotely complimentary to that drive-in burger joint.  The only redeeming part of this was that we went uninterrupted for long periods of time. And after a long day at work, spending quality time together was quite welcome.   We should've just stayed home! At least that would've been more satisfying!",

The place had open seating with plenty of windows to watch the downtown foot traffic and rail car. They have a regular menu, but I took the fun option of 'build your own'. One would think this is for burgers BUT you can build a fried chicken sandwich as well as....check the attached menu. Follow the steps and choose your meat, size, bun, spread, toppings and side. If you 'check in', you can get a free side. I got a burger and my friend ordered the chicken. They were both tasty. I like that they put the spread on the side so you can add the amount you choose.

Waited 15 minutes before drink order was taken.  Then another 15 minutes before order was taken.  And each time it was because I had to ask somebody to attend to us.  Another 20 minutes before food was brought and then never saw another server until I had to again ask for someone to bring me the check.  The thin, blonde hostess had about as much personality as a box of wet tissues.  Whatever happened to a smile, a greeting?  Something that shows me that as a customer, my patronage is appreciated.  She should not be the hostess.    The food...  The fries were delicious.  Great raspberry tea.   Waiting and hour for meh burgers.  Not worth it.  Better hamburgers can be found at 5 guys or even In-N-Out.   I don't recommend this place to anyone.  $38 dollars for two burgers, fries and iced tea.

Upon entering The Counter, we asked the host about the take-out orders and the timeframe for service  because we were on our lunch break. The Host stated that it would be about a 15 minute turn around and we could order from the bar. So we ordered at the bar from the bar server named Nicholas. Here's my order I stated to Nicholas: \"I'd like the Chili Cheese Burger, no tomato but add relish\" as my friend ordered Nicholas asked my friend how he would like his burger cooked, which was not something he asked me so I started to Nicholas at that time \"Could you make my burger Medium Well\" and acknowledged my request. When he brought me the ticket I noticed he entered \"PINK THROUGHOUT\" so I brought that to his attention and he went to explain to me what the differences was between medium and medium-well as, and I looked at him and stated: \"Yes, I said I wanted my burger Medium-Well\"",

Mario's the type of person who can eat a moderate sized meal and be full for hours; I, however, am hungry within an hour of eating. So while he was content with the portions well into the afternoon, I couldn't wait to eat something more (which lead to another afternoon burying my face in a bucket of fro-yo).  The food itself was good. We started with the Sweet Sriracha fries. They were pretty good and we devoured them before our burgers arrived. While many of the specialty burgers sounded great, we opted to build our own burgers. My bacon (of course) and jalapeno cheese burger, with dill pickles and spinach was perfectly cooked to medium. It wasn't greasy, which was pleasant.  Service was attentive without being suffocating. Yeah, it felt like we waited a while to get our food. But it was also incredibly fresh, so compromise. I understand we all have limited time for our lunches downtown, so when we go back we may call ahead to have an order ready for dining in.",

Went here for lunch today with a friend, had to wait ten minutes even though half the tables were open. So when we were seated, we immediately ordered since we both had to return to work afterwards. After waiting an hour, I asked the waiter if we could just get our food to go and have the checks - he brought us the checks and told us that they were boxing up the food now and it'd be out in a second. Signed our checks and sat there for another ten minutes, so it was obviously a lie that they were boxing up our food, which by the way was just a hamburger with lettuce. So I went up yet again and asked to speak to a manager, and the girl said a manager would be right out. I stood there waiting for another 5 minutes and no one came out. Then, our waiter walks out with our food bagged up and says here you go. At this point we didn't even want the food, we just wanted to be refunded as we had wasted an entire hour plus some waiting for a very basic hamburger. He then was extremely rude when I told him we didn't want the food and we just wanted to be refunded. Will not be returning. Paid almost $20 for a burger that took an hour = not worth it",

If the drinks weren't so over priced,  this place may be more tolerable, but I doubt even a fountain of adult beverages would save it.   Running out of bison an hour before closing,  30 minutes from order to table,  and a burger that wasn't even as good as Five Guys(which we ended up at after).  Wrong order,  undercooked beef,  refire raw,  severe lack or service (apparently tea is hard to get) makes this a first and last for me.    As a manager,  you'd think a second issue at a table would A. Come by and B. Do more than take 20% off When she DID come the 2nd time,  at our request,  she did try to make it right, but we shouldn't have had to ask.

The vanilla shake was fabulous! The grilled cheese was wonderful!  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and multiple employees stopped by to check on is while we were there.  A real team environment.  A real inciting environment.  A real comfortable environment.  As I said at the beginning...an awesome place!",

    "text": "I really REALLY enjoyed our food here. Lorenzo, our waiter, was awesome and had a great personality. We came in during a convention in Downtown Phoenix and waited about as long as one would expect to. A miscommunication with the kitchen made out food and appetizers come out at the same time, quite a while after we ordered (again, busy night).   All of these things are worth ignoring for the sake of the food, yet one thing was unacceptable. We were able to apply our $90 groupon to our food, awesome right? Exactly what they are for. But my friends who flew in from out of town, who I bought the lesser groupon for ($30) were denied the opportunity to use theirs. Not okay. Now they have a groupon for a restaurant in a state where they don't even live. I can't get a refund, and though we are frequently in Downtown Phoenix we won't be visiting this place again.   I would also point out that when you ask your customers to wait outside in the heat, you may want to offer them water. Especially when the wait is 40 minutes in 116 degree weather. The last remark I want to make is that it bugged me that we waited that long, and then we were seated on the patio. There was no one out there, and there had been no one out there. Why in the world make us wait if you could have just seated us out there to begin with? We were the first and only ones out there.   Lorenzo, again, you were awesome. Thank you for your hospitality, hopefully they treat you better than they treated us.",

My S/O and I were in town for comic con, and both of us being gluten free (I have celiac disease, he is by choice), finding safe places to eat that does not involve some form of salad has become an art. We happened to walk up to this place to glance at the menu and noticed that they had a gluten free bun. Upon acquiring at the bar, a very knowledgeable bartender offered us both gluten free menus.   I had the \"bison is Gouda\" on a gf bun with the Parmesan fries. And, yeah, I'm gonna be coming back for one of them. Absolutely delicious. My S/O had the red eye (or something like that) and loved it. The garlic aioli and the home made thousand island sauce is amazing and completed the burger.  I really enjoyed the angry pineapple drink as well and was excited to see that they had angry orchard  was on tap and they had a gf beer in bottles.   Very cool vibe. It's right next to the light rail, so every time it passes the floor vibrates, which makes if feel like one of those train side diners, while maintaining a new age spin. We loved it and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "We discovered this very cool place when we were looking for the Impossible Burger, a plant based burger that looks and tastes exactly like a real burger. It is truly amazing and The counter is one of a few eateries to carry it. We travel from Anthem to eat this every week. Our first two visits were excellent. The food was as promised, service was attentive and nice, great to feel servers care about your happiness and inject their warm personalities into the experience, the tip always reflect the service, so 25-30% for caring, timely friendly service is easily justified. This past Saturday my wife and I made our weekly 35 minute drive and this day we were so disappointed. Apathetic server, no manage- ment, poor service, cold food and when the burger showed up, one was missing sweet potato fries, not good, server didn't bother to get them until the meals end and who wants to eat fries after their meal. Where is the care and compassion we witnessed on our first 2 visits, server was not into it and  we tipped accordingl, further fries should not have been charged, no drink refills and with a tab for 2 burgers, lemonade and fries at over $50, this cannot happen again. I just wonder who is going to respond to this review to  determine whether we ever return. Remember guests are coming all the way to your location, parking, entering, spending and adding to your lives, you need to appreciate this and do more to make us want to return to you.",

You get to make your own burger....how you want it...so 1/2 star. Total 2 stars.

I walked in and read the menu, I noticed a chalk board that reads... \"HAPPY HOUR 3pm -6pm\" Build Your Own Burger or Create Your Own Shake, so I thought I'd try it. My server came over and asked if I was ready to order. I replied \" I'm going to order the \"Happy Hour\" Build Your Own Burger and Build Your Own Shake, his reply was... Those shouldn't even be on the board because we don't have those included on the Happy Hour Specials. Then why are they advertised? Very misleading! How much should one pay for a simple Bacon Cheeseburger, Cheddar French Fries and a Milk Shake for ONE PERSON? How about $28.92 The prices are absolutely ridiculous, I have never been overcharged by so much in my entire 27 year career of eating hamburgers. With the tip, my bill came to $32.00 I could've eaten in a fancy restaurant and still paid much less. The pricing is simply highway robbery! Beware before you go, if you're a party of four people, expect to pay around $120.00 Come on people, it's burgers and fries it's not fillet mignon steak & lobster, get your pricing together.  I should've went to eat all you can eat sushi for $20 and I've had a much better meal. I really hope to see restaurants like this fail because of how they gouge the public. Also, you misled people to believe its discounted for your so called HAPPY HOUR! And did I mention how bad the service was? Good Luck... Change your name to The Cash Register   See BYOB & BYOS HAPPY HOUR PHOTO BELOW.... Very Misleading!",

Mitchel, our server, was a nice man. We were told the bartenders were behind. we could see them pretty much the whole time, and within 15 minutes half the place had cleared out.  After these first 15 minutes passed, Another large group was seated. As our food was arriving, I asked the lady delivering food if she could check on our drinks. (we ordered the drinks at 556 pm, it was now 627pm) \"THE BAR IS BACKED UP\"... I looked over and the other party had their drinks already. The manager simply said there was nothing she could do... she said she would have made them herself if she could, which, as a veteran of the food industry, is EXACTLY what she should have done... helped out the bar if they really were behind... I have never worked for a restauraunt that gave priority to anything but drinks... they usually have a higher profit margin than food, and you can serve them faster than food. I had already finished my food, so we asked them to simply cancel the drink order, as time was nearing for our concert. The Hostess was extremely pleasant as well. However, they need a manager with something other than a title. The food tasted good, but was lukewarm. Another table had gotten up and left, and they told us good luck, it was just taking too long... so sad. This place has good potential, and hoepfully someday I can try one of their Counterballs!!",

One time they just had a sign on the door saying they we closed after I got a large group together to go after an event I was running, and another time they were closed for a convention after I made a trip down from Mesa to go. I have never had this happen anywhere else, but had it happen here twice. I've heard the food is good, but if I have to call and make sure they are open every time that I want a burger, I'll just go to the Burger Joint at Roosevelt Square which is an amazing burger.",

    "text": "Got to admit I was a little disappointed when the fast casual Mexican food restaurant closed not because it was great food, but the location was easy and convenient!  The Counter did a great job renovating the space and a big improvement to the quality of food.  Got the turkey burger with a few items thrown on it and everything tasted great.  Lorenzo, the bar tender who assisted me was great; refilled my ice tea, gave me a to go cup before leaving and brought my check in a timely fashion.  A few observations: for the price I paid for the burger I would have thought a small side would have come with it and since it did not I feel it is a slightly high price for a burger. I also noticed there was no one greeting people at the door therefore no one to seat you and the energy was a little low in the restaurant.  Those are minor issues, but it seems like a place that should be upbeat especially at the prices they are charging.",

We are in town for the Phoenix Comic Con(Fan Fusion whatever) and we knew we loved The Counter from when stopped in last year as well. This year on the first day we went (Friday), we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. When we went last night (Saturday), we had to wait 35 minutes to be seated when the entire front left side of the restaurant was empty the whole time we waited. We did wander around and saw people out on the patio so I get it, there was a lot of people being served. But on weekends like this, I would've expected the restaurant to be better staffed and opened later than 9pm. It was nice of them to seat us at 8:30 even though they were closing at 9. Saw a lot of people get turned away. I get it though. It's hard to find people willing to work later shifts like that. Just a suggestion though. Food was still amazing. Will be stopping in again next year.",

She was fun and attentive, but knew exactly when to back off and let us \"enjoy\" our food. Fantastic service.   Shoestring fries are my favorite. These were crisp and light and wonderful. I offered some to my date but I was very relieved when she declined.   The Counter is a cool trendy place. Kind of like an updated diner sort of feel.   THE BURGER WAS COLD.   Every component was cold. If you're offering a completely customized burger but can't handle putting all the components on in a timely fashion, why offer it? The patty was cold, the grilled peppers and tomatoes were cold, the lettuce was cold, the draft beer was cold, my seat was slightly cold. SO COLD.   And that will be the only time I complain about something being too cold in the summertime in Phoenix.",

As good a Turkey Burger as you'll find, very good fish, great fries and excellent service. This place? It's awful!  I'm actually quite upset with myself that I didn't complain, and paid their high prices for awful food. The 1/2 lb turkey burger came in 2 very dried out, rubbery patties. The fries had obviously been sitting for a while. They were also dry. Dinner for two, over $45 + tip. Less than mediocre service.   Anyone going here should know not all locations are this bad. What I'd like to know though, is how the head office can allow their brand to be trashed like this.",

Literally stumbling distance from the light rail this place does not disappoint! My nephew and I select the create your own burgers (CYOB) and my niece chooses the kids cheeseburger sliders.  The options are plentiful for the CYOB and honestly could become a little overwhelming for someone that is indecisive.  I go with a turkey burger on a pretzel bun and gouda, grilled onions, artichoke hearts and the standard lettuce, tomato set up. Condiments/sauces options are plentiful and come on the side so I would suggest trying a few.  My nephew went with a beef burger on a pretzel bun with coleslaw and a couple other items and a side of sweet potato fries that we shared.  Food was fast, fresh and filling!  Service and staff were quick and friendly.    We decided we would definitely be back as we have so many other CYOB combos to try!",

I've also had the cake batter shake which was super great too. If you are of age, you should definitely try it with the vanilla/a whipped cream flavored shot. I tried the deviled eggs too, which are amazing. How many bars offer that? Yeah. None--get outta here! :) check out the happy hour for sure!  I'm usually waited on by Nick (I believe his name is). I was waited on tonight 2/27/16 by a different bartender, who was equally as awesome. The hostess I've seen before other times as well and she's always friendly. Their customer service is great. The fact that the hostess and bartender recognize me is an awesome feeling because most places don't have that recognition anymore.  Everyone is nice and chats when they are able to, which makes you feel \"at home\".   Here's where I get upset... A party of 12 people rolled in on a Saturday night (tonight 2/27/16) and were told they would have a 10 minute wait. The party was annoyed. Are you serious?? That's far better than anywhere else for wait time. Also, to the party of 12... If you cannot wait ten minutes for a table and want burgers (but have no patience) --that's unfortunate, as burgers take some time to cook. Unless you want that burger out in less than 5... AKA raw on your plate!!    ***Also, to parties greater than five people... Please reserve tables. Your upset at restaurants is most likely due to your lack of planning (even giving a heads up of 10 minutes to the place you're going to is a help)... Especially on a Saturday night.   Another party made my faith in humanity disappear, yet again when they couldn't wait 5 minutes for a table. Yes-- there are \"so many empty tables\". But if there isn't enough staff to manage those tables, you won't be receiving great service. I mean, it's just common sense.  Then you will only be complaining about your \"subpar service\" (probably here on Yelp).  Furthermore, I would like to mention that this is my first Yelp review, as I felt obligated to defend the honor of a local restaurant. I come here after work on weekends and have never been treated poorly. The prices are always reasonable and the food has never been anything but great. The staff here is super friendly and deserve nothing but the same from its customers.  Two thumbs up. And I'll be back for a cold pint and burgers soon :)",

If 'adult milkshakes' are your thing, they have some cool boozey dessert shakes too.  The problem is how understaffed this place is, especially when you have a groupon to bring in more business. The hostess was really friendly, but when we arrived she told us there was a 10 minute wait. Mind you, the restaurant was empty and there were maybe 5 seated tables outside- on a Friday night at 6:15. Once we were seated, our server took quite a long time to take our order, bring us our drinks, and when he did being our order- no utensils until we asked another waiter 10 minutes later. I really want to like this place because the food is good, the location is prime and the staff were all friendly- they just had too little of staff so they couldn't give attentive service.  I hope they step it up. I am routing for the place to do better, but there is no way to do that is you don't have any bussers, enough servers and more than one bartender on a Friday night.",

I opted for the 1/3 lb organic bison, horseradish aioli with basic toppings, since I was still in my volunteer uniform that is white.  It was a good burger, that was seasoned well.  My side was shoestring onions, perfectly cooked and a nice seasoned batter.  They also offer some created ones, if you want unique combos.  Definitely worth it to try.",

It was so nice to be able to customize the burger to be exactly what you wanted, especially with so many great options (including sooo many sauces). While of course the good stuff is extra - $1.25 extra for add-ons like bacon or avocado - you can make a very filling burger without choosing those. Sweet potato fries were decent, but what took them over the top was the sauce choices. I also got a peanut butter chocolate shake: the flavor was good, but consistency pretty thin.",

As someone who has worked in a restaurant before, Sundays can be very, very busy. I applaud the waitstaff for their dedication to providing the best service to the customers, despite how completely swamped they were. I will definitely come back, but the management needs to schedule more people on weekends so the waitstaff is not overwhelmed.",

    "text": "My friends and I chose burgers for lunch and gave this place a try. I chose to build my own burger and chose the counter relish as my dressing. Which I think is just ketchup with relish in it. So a little disappointed cause ketchup is already on the table. Should've went with mustard. We shared sides of fried pickles and shoestring onions. The fried pickles were good but I've had better and we didn't care for the apricot sauce that came with them. Shoestring onions were pretty tasty too and kind of delicate but they were good and came with a side of ranch and BBQ sauce for dipping. The burger was delicious!   Here's why I can't give this place a higher rating. There were 3 of us and we were sharing the sides and the sauces that came with them were in little cups. So we asked to get a couple more sides of ranch to dip our sides in so we'd each have our own and could double dip in our own sauce if we wanted and because we did not like the apricot sauce and didn't want the BBQ sauce. The server had no problem bringing the sauces but what she failed to tell us is there's a cost for each extra side of sauce and we only asked for ranch and she brought us BBQ sauce too. So we had 4 extra sides of sauce but only needed 2. We didn't know there was an extra cost until we got the bill. It's ok if it costs extra for sides of sauce but we should've been advised first. I ended up using one of the BBQ sauces on my burger cause I didn't care for the counter relish. Not a horrible experience but could've been better. Burgers are good though.",

They can be decently cheap or pretty expensive thanks to a sizable create your own burger menu that features a TON of aioli sauces (chipotle's my favorite).   My last trip, I finally opted for the turkey burger and it was just as delicious - a rare feat indeed (the last time I found a turkey burger equal to a hamburger was at Delux).

Where they really shined was their cocktails.  Their signature cocktails are made to perfection and very delicious. Also the music was sweet and it seemed like it would be a great family restaurant.",

    "text": "I should preface this review by stating that this is purely based on customer service not the the food. The food at The Counter is EXCELLENT, which, is the only reason I keep giving it the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately after another bad experience I finally decided to write a review. Myself and some of my coworkers have been to The Counter a hand full of times since they've opened because of the delicious food. We have experienced long waits, missing food, over charges, under charges, and poor managerial intervention. As I mentioned before, today was the straw that broke the camels back, as they say. Due to our past experiences we decided to call ahead and place our order in an attempt to alleviate the long waits and confusion at the bar. We were told it would be ready in 10-15 mins. We waited 15 mins before we left the office, then walked the 5 mins it takes to get to the restaurant, and low and behold our food was still not ready. The dining room was not crowded and there we only a couple people at the bar so the hostess said it'd be right up. Another 15 mins later the food was still not out so the hostess checked and said it was being packed up. While we were waiting, a customer came up to the bar with their to go order that was wrong and they somehow were able to cook her a new order and send her on her way, all while our food was being \"packed up\". When our order finally came out we decided to check it. There weren't  any sauces for the burgers, a side of fries was missing, one sandwich was missing bacon, and one had extra toppings that were not ordered. We crossed checked the receipts and all were exactly what we ordered but not sure where the confusion came (It should also be noted that we all ordered different burgers). Once the staff fixed everything and we got back to our office, we finally the tasted the food, which was great, but this time that won't be enough to keep us coming back for more...",

I asked the waitress was it seasoned, she said the cook seasons it with salt and pepper...it didn't even have that.  It was blah! The salad had cucumbers, olives, tomatoes, lettuce, but the dressing that accompanied it was not flavorful...it was too salty and it did not complement the turkey.  I did have a side order of shoestring fries which was the highlight of my meal.  My friend had a regular classic burger...it looked good, but she didn't have any comment on how it tasted. it was just okay.  I have been to Zinburger and never had a bad piece of meat.  Maybe The Counter has good shakes and desserts.",

Our waiter never came back. After sitting there someone else came and asked us for our drink order again.....after we had already been sitting for an hour. We then ask for the manager and ask her what was going on with our order. She went to go find out and told us that our order had been put in 5 minutes ago. Again we had been sitting waiting for an hour. The manager apologized was quite non challant about how long it took our food and we decided to leave. I will never eat here EVER!!!!!!",

    "text": "I ate here Sunday evening just before close with a friend. The food was good but service sucked horribly.   I ordered a custom burger with side of chili as did my buddy although his was off the menu. It took nearly 45 minutes for our server to return to the table only to advise that my order had been missed/ mixed up but was being expedited and available shortly.   Being I also ordered a bowl of chili also , I didn't get too crazy but asked that my chili be brought out immediately. My buddy had already been brought his chili ( with no utensils/spoon ). Again I waited probably another 15 minutes before I flagged down a second server and asked that my chili be sent out. It was probably another 10 minutes before that occurred.   My buddy ate his (cold) chili as well as his burger before I even received my chili. We were both bewildered why, with no more than three tables, it took such an extended period to obtain food. It's typical once a mistake is made for a server to do what it takes to recover and expedite the meal.   I'm not prone to exaggeration but I've received better service at a McDonalds.   On a good note, the food was quite good so ok inclined to go in again but I hope this feedback encourages service changes. Everyone was friendly, the food was good but serious focus should be made on service or I doubt your business will last.",

The burgers are cooked just right and have the right amount of seasoning to them. I also really liked their chili as I am not a big fan of chili. The flavors were so good. There were not a lot of beans in the chili which was kind of bothersome to my co-worker but I loved the flavor. It is a little pricey for a hamburger but you can add a lot of stuff before you have to pay extra. Their salads are very tasty also and you can also build your own salad. They have shoestring fries that are light and crispy Yummy",

Took 45 min to get our food and then once we got our food our custom burgers were customize between my wife's burger and mine. She had half of my stuff and I had half of hers.

Our server Christopher, greeted us by saying are you ready to order and we stated we would like to order drinks. The server replied he would come back when we were ready to order everything including food. He said it would take forever if we only ordered drinks at the time in the valley of the sun. Once we ordered the drinks took forever and my wife's beer was just sitting at the bar. The server appeared to be in such a hurry he forgot to take my wife's order and had to be reminded that she still needed to order her food twice. The appetizer we ordered came out cold because the server didn't bring it out after it just sat in the window. I wanted to just have the appetizer warmed up but the server never came back to ask how it was.  While I was waiting for my food I began to read reviews and noticed the main complaint of the restaurant was how long everything took. I know the restaurant reads these reviews and I put this on the management too.   Once we got our burgers they were excellent. The guacamole was suburb along with everything else. It was just to bad our server Christopher was so horrible and couldn't even get the order right.   The hostess that day was very helpful and did more for us than our server.",

When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be about a five minute wait for a table, despite there being at least 6 empty tables that would have fit our party.  We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  After we were seated, we sat at the table for at least ten to fifteen minutes without anyone coming over to our table to take our drink or lunch order.  So, we decided to just go to the bar and order the food as takeout.  While waiting for our takeout order, the hostess attempted to toss trash into the bar trash can (approximately 10 feet away) and missed the can but hit a customer.  After about 15 minutes of additional waiting, we received out takeout.  We ordered two Hippie Salads and added grilled chicken breast to them.  Those salads were $14 each (because grilled chicken breast adds $4 to the price).  We also ordered a Caesar Salad which was $8.50.    Upon returning to the office the discovered the Hippie Salads were fine, even if a bit overpriced.   The Caesar Salad, however, was ridiculous.  It consisted of THREE leafs of lettuce, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, and a few croutons for $8.50!!  I will never return to the Counter.  The service is terrible and the food is overpriced.",
