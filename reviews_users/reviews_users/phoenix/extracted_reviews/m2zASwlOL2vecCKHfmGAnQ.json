Buffalo, beef, Pork, and scallops all were tender and prepared \"just right.\"  Birthday dessert was chocolate bread pudding and we also were tempted to lick the bowl of the budino-a cream, caramel, peach delight.   People at the next table, yes very close, admitted to returning for their second night in a row; we are likewise tempted to return tomorrow or SOON!",

We have been back three times in the last three months and have had an excellent experience each time. The food is delicious and we have always been pleased with the service. Don't let the strip mall turn you off...the inside of the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. I recommend stopping in for happy hour, as their beef tenderloin sliders are amazing (although you can't go wrong with anything on the menu). I'm so happy to live close to this terrific, local restaurant!",

    "text": "Located between an Panda Express and a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich shop my family and I decided to check out this restaurant.  I looked on Yelp and the reviews were pretty good. I peak inside the door, it looks empty. We had a party of six and walked in about 5pm.  The restaurant is not busy at the moment and there were three tables occupied at the time.  One of which is outside on the patio.  So, there we are standing in front of the hostess stand.  All six of us.  The host finally asks us \"can I help you?\". I reply \"yes, six for dinner, please.\"  She looks down...we wait....finally she says to us...\"my next available for six is 8pm\".  No, I didn't have a reservation.  She didn't ask, anyways. That was it.  She moved on to other concerns and walked away.  Ok, I didn't know reservations were required at such a fancy strip mall restaurant....my fault.  However, I felt her intention was to make me feel stupid for not knowing.  Obviously standing there with six people at 5pm, I'm not there to make reservations for 8pm.  So...what to do? We left and went to an excellent local brew house restaurant across the street named OHSO.  We had an excellent time and dinner.  And the hostess was very nice. Oh and I got a phone call at about 8:15 asking about a reservation made on Open Table for six.",

There we three of us: my husband had the skirt steak with to-die-for truffle mac n cheese, I had the pork osso bucco, our friend had the \"Kitchen\" burger. Note: Skip the burger and go for the other stuff.  Ignore the fact that their wood door makes the place look like it's closed and under construction (and the hostesses will tell you that they hear that multiple times every night). Once you get inside, the decor is hip and comfortable.  We will definitely be back! (I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the burger and the door!)",

We were not even slightly disappointed. Everything was perfect, from the service, to dessert. The American Onion Soup satisfied my picky father and husband, their take on a Caprese salad was phenomenal, wish so bad I could have the recipe for the tomato sorbet, though not sure how I'd freeze it anyway. My mom's salad was the best she's had in a long while - the vinaigrette just the right amount and not too vinaigary, the blue cheese puffs, perfection.  On to the main courses. Can't remember what the vegetarian bread pudding entree was, but looked as good as my sister said it was. The spare ribs, scallops and salmon were perfect. My guess is anything else we might have ordered would have been equally wonderful. Deserts were awesome as well. The homemade butter pecan ice-cream was as much pecan as ice cream, if you like it nutty, this will be a great choice for you. The creme brulee and other custard dessert (can't remember the name of it) were good - but the real killer dessert is the chocolate bread pudding with salted caramel sauce, oh my gosh, incredible.",

So we were in the area of Tatum and Cactus and I decided to Yelp something from my phone.  I discover this fine little establishment with what looked to be a spectacular menu.  I thought, \"If they can pull this off, I am in.\"  Pull it off they did, indeed.  Not only did they turn my whole day around, but I discovered a fantastic new restaurant.   We walk in, they place has only been open a few weeks, we were promptly greeted with warm inviting smiles and everyone was extremely friendly.  The build out of the restaurant was really nice and I was excited to sample the menu.  The only problem I could see, was that I could not possibly eat every dish.    I chose the Boneless Short Ribs, which came out so tender and moist and delicious, I was in heaven.  It was accompanies with a Sweet Potato mash, that was 'vanilla scented' according to the menu.  The short ribs had ancho chili chocolate sauce on top, just a light glaze that really brought out the flavor in the short ribs.  The entire meal was delightful with great service and great wine.   My mom chose to have the the Butternut Squash filled ravioli which has a delightful sauce over them and resting on a baby spinach bed.  They were fresh made, I think they make everything there.  These were awesome!  The fulling was not sweet, it tasted like they did nothing but puree the squash, simple, elegant and perfect as it is.    Apparently Rusconi's uses local produce for their menu and that insures freshness of each dish they provide.  I would definitely recommend dining here.  I saw they even had a nice happy hour menu also, available at the bar only. My next stop will be happy hour for sure. Keep up the good food and service!",

We arrived a little earlier than our reso and ordered a drink at the bar. The bartender was out of Luxardo as well as basil, so our 2 choices of cocktails were nixed fairly quickly.   After being seated, we ordered 2 orders of the short rib appetizer. Hands down the most tender short rib I have ever had.  For dinner we ordered the lamb, served with fava beans, gnocci, and mushrooms, as well as the filet medallions with white truffle mac and cheese with a side of bacon brussels sprouts. There wasn't a single remnant of food on any of the plates when we were done. SO DELICIOUS.   For dessert we couldn't choose just one, so we ordered 3. The vanilla budino with cinnamon whipped cream, the creme brulee, and the star of the show, the dark chocolate bread pudding, made with brioche over a vanilla cream and topped with slated caramel glaze and fresh berries. I could have ordered 3 more of these, they were so damn good.   Our waiter, John, made our meal even more excellent with his amazing personality, jokes, and attentiveness to our table. Thanks for a  great experience and cannot wait to come back.",

The great thing about it is that it always seems different but tastes great. I love that it is grilled.  A+ flatbread  The Mac & Cheese is out of this world. So delicious! You can't go wrong here.  The Pork Belly is one of my husband's personal favorites as well. So much flavor packed into this dish.  We have had many other dishes that have all been tasty and can't wait to try more.

We have now had almost half of the brunch menu and everything is spot on, as a chef I can appreciate the extra time and attention to detail on the smallest of things.

I have been there a couple times now, the first time during restaurant week to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised. I do not like to give five stars unless a place really wows me, and this place did, mostly from the food and the service perspective. The service was fantastic, and the food was very, very good. You can tell a lot of love from Chef Michael Rusconi and his staff went into the food. Nice size portions, and lot's of flavor, and very well priced. I was expecting an expensive meal, and I was surprised at how affordable it was, great value for what you get.   Although the interior is nice, it deserves a structure with a lot more character besides a spot in a strip mall. But then again, the food and service is so good, you forget about the surroundings.

I love his accompaniments as they are different and very good but, his main dish on both have been disappointing.  Both cuts of meat were made more flavorful by what they were served with and could not stand alone.  The NY was thin a flavorless, the Buffalo - the same.  For a gentleman coming off years at Lons, I expect a little bit more than thin, flavorless main dishes.  Also, unless you feel like a Creme Brulee with the consistency of chocolate mouse, I would stay away from the Chocolate Creme Brulee dessert.  If you go at night, don't expect quick service.  It is slower so be prepared to just relax and enjoy your meal.  It's a wonderful addition to the area and he has great ideas, I just think he needs to tweak a few items on the menu.",

We had a reservation and were quickly seated in the back which was not busy or as noisy as the bar in front. We ordered cocktails and when they came we were surprised at the small size.  We then shared a romain salad, which was good but again small.  My husband is a fan of seafood and ordered the seafood paella and when it came we could not believe how little was on his plate!  From my side of the table all I could see was three muscles and a little rice.  In the rice there were some very small portions of the rest of the dish.  I ordered the roasted shrimp flatbread which was not  large but very good - however I could not taste the shrimp so they could save some money and eliminate them from the dish.  I am a light eater so I shared my flatbread with my husband as he did not have enough to eat with the meager paella.  We expected more from  Rusconi as we were regulars of Lon's while he was there.  We wish Rusconi the best of luck but do not plan to return to Rusconi's American Kitchen.",

After receiving our beverages, we ordered our meal. We got the pork belly app, and flat bread pizza, braised short ribs and the butternut squash raviolis'. It's evident Rusconi's use fresh ingredients and home made techniques. The pork belly was tender and melted in my mouth. The flat bread was crispy but not overcooked. It was topped with fresh tomato's and mozzarella. The butternut squash ravioli's come as 3 large home made ravioli's with a corn jus. The short ribs were braised perfectly and were served with a knife which I just put to the side because it wasn't needed. The were so tender and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and don't pass up Rusconi's Kitchen. There's no other restaurant like it near by. There's plenty of restaurants near by but none of the quality of Rusconi's.

My husband and I tried the restaurant on several occasions. We want a non-chain restaurant to succeed in this location. We've experienced lapses in service and the food has been unmemorable. A particular visit particularly stands out. We brought our family to Rusconi's for lunch. The bartender acted very disinterested. We sat for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks. When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole. The posole resembled dirty dishwater. There was literally one piece of posole floating in the broth. When we asked our waiter to split the checks, he sighed and said it was a \"big deal\" for him to do so. Needless to say, we won't be back nor will any members of our party.",

    "text": "Lured in by the fixed price Restaurant Week menu, we enjoyed a surprisingly fantastic dinner here.  Located in a busy strip mall, we were skeptical as we approached but were immediately set at ease after we walked in. The interior is very upscale with an open kitchen, sit down bar, and is larger inside than what it appeared from the parking lot.  We each tried one of the three appetizers, entrees, and deserts that were featured and were not disappointed with anything (nor was there a morsel left on any of the plates!)  We were able to try the mushroom soup (could have used a little more salt and a fresh herb garnish), corn polenta with shrimp, and roasted beet salad along with the braised short ribs, fresh sea bass, and beef tenderloin medallions with goat cheese polenta.  The wines suggested to go with the entrees were perfect, wait staff was excellent, and ambiance superb.  We will definitely be going back again!",

    "text": "Greed isn't pretty, but it's reality for this restaurant. We made an open table reservation for Valentines day.  One of us can't have any sugar, and also prefers a nice fish selection whenever possible. We thought this would be an easy place to meet our preferences.   Well these guys decided that guests dining on this day can ONLY order their $59 per person prix fix meal, with few entree choices and a dessert included for each person. None of this was noted at the time of the reservation. They basically took their regular pricing for a small appetizer, entree, and dessert and bundled it all together as a mandatory packaged deal, but then RAISED the price compared to regular menu prices.   So not only do you need to order/purchase more food than you want, with a limited selection (1 fish choice), but you have to pay extra for the pleasure of dining there.  Rude!  Why not offer the special holiday menu as an extra option for those who prefer prix fix, and not as the only menu available to order from??  Greed, that's why?!  You gouged me, so I will not be going back.",

The staff goes above and beyond, the the appetizers (spicy peach goat cheese fondue) and drinks (spicy bloody with green chili vodka) blew us away and the rotating entree menu was unreal.  We have lived in Phoenix/Scottsdale for 4 years now, been to a ton of restaurants and Rusconi's is in our Top 5.  Great all-around restaurant!",

    "text": "I've eaten here before with my husband and with friends for lunch and dinner and had a great experience both times. Good service, great food, nice ambience. So when a friend suggested we try it for a girls brunch, I was excited to try their brunch menu. If I was basing this review off just the brunch experience today, it would be two stars. So, 3 stars reflects the better prior experiences. I would eat here again for the food but only in smaller groups.  We had a 10am reservation for our party of 6 and were seated promptly. The restaurant was pretty empty with maybe 2 or 3 other tables occupied. We ordered drinks at about 10:15 and food about 10 minutes later. The food came out before the drinks - when we asked about them, we were told it took this long because the bartender had to make them from scratch...yet tables seated after we ordered already had their (made from scratch) drinks. No apology for it taking 30 minutes to make 4 drinks.   Most of the food was very tasty. It's a little pricey in my opinion - the main dishes are reasonable, but the side dishes are $$$ ($6 for a bowl of berries!). One of us ordered a salad, which was not good, so stick with the breakfast food at brunch.  When the check came, it was all on one tab. Apparently they have a policy of no more than 4 checks per table. This is fine, but it was not mentioned up front or even when the check was dropped off. We went through the bill and noted which items should be put on which card (I would not have done it this way, but I was holding my toddler at the time). This was apparently very confusing because we did not see our server again for nearly 30 minutes. We flagged down a manager (I believe), who at that point mentioned the 4 check policy. We offered to split out the charges which was ignored. Our server finally returned with our checks and explained that he ended up with $17 that he couldn't figure out what card to put on so he just ate the charge (I would normally feel bad for this and tip to cover it, but given how long it took to get our drinks, not so much).   TLDR: good for couples or a family, not good for larger groups or if you want your drinks quickly. Definitely a disappointing experience today.",

The cabbage stood out as it was braised with prickly pear. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The wood burning cooking method really pays off at Rusconi...definitely worth a try.

My husband and I really enjoyed the arugula and prosciutto salad to start.   We would definitely order that again.  The salad was followed by the Salmon with the blackberry glaze for me - delicious but the accompanying potatoes were undercooked.   My husband and one of our friends had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin Medallions.   The meat was good (not great) and the truffle mac and cheese on the plate was very good.   The 4th person in our group had the Scallops and those were reportedly excellent.   We also shared the Brussels Sprouts (good), and the Parmesan and white truffle scented fries (ok).   For dessert I had the Budino (yum - salted caramel pudding) and our friends tried the bread pudding which they liked.",

It came back rare - so unfortunately I had to send it back - the server was sharp - she offered to keep my friends meal heated while they got mine right - so thumbs up on her thinking!  It was very flavorful - excellent presentation - downside the other medallion was a completely different piece of meat that wasn't very palatable (very unfortunate - though it can happen - I didn't complain - as I didn't have a big appetite this eve).  I would recommend the dish otherwise.  We were given time to have a pleasant conversation and were checked on regularly.  I'll try it again - just not at the top of my list.

We also loved the atmosphere of the restaurant as well.  I had the salmon, which was cooked perfectly...and that blackberry glaze!  My husband enjoyed the scallops, which were the best he's ever had.  The truffled mac n cheese is to die for, but so is the dark chocolate bread pudding!

We had a gift certificate we got in a charity cancer auction and the value was for 320 dollars. There was some language in the gift certificate that stated a special chef prepared dinner. The chef decided to interpret that as everything we had just ordered wasn't allowed with the gift certificate.  Maybe we misunderstood but he didn't offer anything off of the bill. If it is truly 320 dollars in value tough to understand how we don't get something off the tab. Unbelievable how bad he handled this. We were willing to agree with the chef but giving some sort of discount anyone else would have done given the way the gift certificate read. I wouldn't want to give another dime to this place.",

    "text": "Unlike previous visits to Rusconi's, the Valentine's dinner left a bad taste in our mouths.  It all started with a lousy table in a corner at the back by the exit door. Because it was Valentine's Day, my husband had booked the table 6 weeks ago. He noted that we were bringing out-of-town friends and requested a nice table. It didn't happen.  Next disappointment came with the lukewarm lobster bisque after I had specifically asked that my soup be served super hot. After sending it back, I finally got the reheated soup (which still wasn't hot) when the rest of my party had finished their appetizers. My husband had the beef short rib risotto, it was tasty but not hot either. As well, I found the sea bass entree to be bland and in need of basic seasonings. Given the restaurant served only a limited Valentine's dinner menu (6 appetizers, 5 entrees & 3 desserts) why weren't the dishes up to par?  The incident that marred our evening was when the bus girl dropped dirty cutlery on my jacket when clearing the plates. She didn't think it was a big deal until I started wiping off the mess with a wet cloth and brought it to her attention. All she said was \"my bad\". Another person came by to apologize followed by the General Manager who went on about giving me his card, taking clothes to dry cleaner and calling him to follow up. PLEASE, I didn't come for dinner on Valentine's Day to create work for myself by chasing Tom for a $10 dry cleaning bill!  A more appropriate/appeasing gesture would be to offer me a complimentary glass of wine.  The final straw was being served lukewarm/stale coffee. My husband had to send back 2 bad cups before finally served a fresh-brewed coffee.  Our experience was a bust thanks to the restaurant's lack of quality control. We used to consider Rusconi's one of our favourite restaurants in Phoenix but were totally disappointed tonight. We will not be returning to or recommending Rusconi's any time soon.",

I always thought, how good can it really be it's in a strip mall, but looks can be deceiving. From the moment we entered we were treated graciously by the wait staff and welcomed personally by the manager. Service was impeccable and unbelievably friendly but not overbearing. The food was solid and not overly complicated but in a good way.  I selected the sea scallops over grits and brussels sprouts topped with cabbage. The scallops were generously sized, not gritty and were cooked to perfection. The mix of sweet, salty and bitter worked quite well together and I highly recommend it. My wife had the salmon and it was quite good and again a solid dish and well cooked. It had a delicious berry glaze and smoky pecan taste throughout. Dinner completed with a berry bondino which was excellent. Not too sweet and was a great conclusion to the meal. Overall highly recommended and I hope to visit again.",

We finally made it for dinner and it was even better than we expected. My husband had the beef medallions and amish blue cheese potato salad, which he really enjoyed. I had one of the evening specials - the tomato and burrata salad. In the past, at other restaurants, when I have ordered this I am always disappointed by either the bland burrata or poor quality tomatoes. Not this time as both were excellent. I also had the garlic wilted spinach, which also was very good. We shared the Ricotta Beignets, which were so tasty.  The service provided by Meghan and the bus staff was exceptional. Chef Rusconi is highly visible and a truly \"hands-on chef\" which shows in his food. It was a very enjoyable evening and we will return. It is wonderful to see a \"non-chain\" restaurant in that area become so successful.",

    "text": "We were in Arizona for three days, and unfortunately I hardly had one good meal in this state.  In search for good food for fair prices, we came here.  We got the mushroom soup, pork belly, buffalo steak, their creme brulee, and coffee.   We arrived here with high hopes, which were crushed pretty quickly.  We were sat by the back door which was propped open on a very cold night.  So after sitting here for a little while, I asked for my boyfriend's jacket, and soon after, he had to go to the car to get another jacket so that we would both be covered.    Once we ordered our food, we had to wait a good while before the waiter came with the first course: pork belly and sausage.  He simply put the plate down on the table and walked away.  He didn't say here's your first course, or describe the meal, it felt to me as if he almost threw the plate in front of me.    The sausage was good, but both my boyfriend and I thought the pork belly was overdone, and it wasn't quite as fatty as we usually like.    Next was the soup and the buffalo.  We asked for the buffalo to be medium rare, which it wasn't.  It was cooked to medium with the last one third of it being well-done.    The soup while well seasoned and flavorful, seemed to lack body and depth.   Next we ordered coffee, which came to us almost cold, and the waiter never offered to refill our cup.  We also got the creme brulee since our waiter suggested it.  The creme was a trio: a vanilla, chocolate, and a pumpkin.   All three shared two problems: the sugar had been laid on a very thick layer, resulting on a think candy like crust instead of the mere crunch a proper creme brule would have.  The texture was also unpleasant, and it seemed like the eggs had curdled a bit, so it wasn't as smooth as I like.  Moreover, the pumpkin one really didn't taste that good at all.   We wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

They were even better, though I wouldn't have believed that was possible had she not shared a little with me.  The service was very attentive.  The best thing was how thoughtful and fun our waiter was.  Our 9 year old doesn't always feel comfortable in a \"grownup's restaurant,\" but our waiter engaged so thoughtfully and nicely with her that she had a fantastic time.  Our other two were also struck, saying afterward that \"the waiter was just so nice!\"  The owner came by the table and introduced himself as well.  He made the children feel welcome and thought of.  He told our youngest that if she didn't find what she wanted on the desert menu, they would make anything they had the ingredients for.  Back to the food.  The desserts were great.  My wife got the chocolate bread pudding.  I got the, Hm..., carmel and fruit covered pudding.  It was all delicious.  You wanted to just close your eyes and enjoy how good it was.

Which is why I'm disappointed enough to write this review.   Last week we selected Rusconi's as the place to meet some friends we hadn't seen in a year.  Shortly after being seated we got our drinks and menus.  And then, less than 5 minutes later, the waiter was back to get our order.  We told him we hadn't even looked at the menu and asked that he come back in a couple minutes.  I reckon he was there in less than two.  The orders were placed and delivered quickly.  The food was great and we added a dessert.   The check followed within minutes and as we sat, finishing drinks, about one hour and 20 minutes after sitting down, the Chef and owner came to our table.  While he thanked us for coming, it was apparent to all of us that his real point of contact was to let us know it was time to leave, then said he had to get back to the kitchen.  It was only our table he visited.  The adjacent tables had been seated a bit after ours.  Perhaps he stopped by theirs a little later.   It was a hurried dinner, not a relaxing dining experience",

I had the beef medallions and they were amazing, the sides just pushed it over the edge. My husband had the cod special and he liked it just as much. They have a great selection of wine as well.

The beef medallions were also a good choice and done to perfection.  They were served over truffle Mac and cheese, with carrots and green beans.

We came at 4 and it was happy hour. They have a happy hour menu. We started with the grilled peach fondue. Good not great. The bread was \"toasted\" under a salamander and it tasted like butane. We told our server who was great and he fixed it right away. The untoasted bread was much better.   Short rib sliders. Yum. Juicy, beefy, with horseradish. Awesome.   Be advised that in general the portion sizes are on the smaller size and will only feed one. Nothing is really big enough to even share with your dining partner. That said everything was great except as noted.   Our server even came by and let us know he would be a way in a short nightly meeting and asked if we would be ok till then. I think they must read reviews on Yelp and have really tried to improve the service from what the recent elite experienced.  Beef medallions. Wow the chef knows how to cook proteins. The beef was perfectly cooked rare like I had requested. The scallops I added were also perfectly cooked. The dish as a whole lacked a bit of seasoning. The chef came by after our server inquired and I let him know I thought  things needed some salt. I think it was great that the chef took time to come by. The Mac and cheese was really good. Just not enough of it. I would have like a bit more.   Fingerling potatoes. Good. Well cooked. Firm not mushy. I would have preferred some crispiness.   Squash and goat cheese bread pudding. Initially my wife was meh but near the end of the meal she said she liked it but would not order it again. She did say that after she added salt is was much better.   White garnet yam potato salad. Nice and light.   Dark chocolate bread pudding. Very good.   Bree cheesecake. Very good take on regular cheese cake.   Service 5/5. Really amazing service. Food 5/5 because they made even small mistakes better.",

    "text": "This was the one meal of the trip that I made reservations for as I knew I wanted to try this place out.  Everything about Rusconi was great from the food to the service to the price making it our standout meal of this trip.    Since we had a late lunch we just went for entrees and the flavors and presentation was spot on.  Owner and Executive Chef Michael Rusconi was in full view and on hand finishing up the dishes to make sure everything is perfect and perfect they were.  I was so glad that I ate here on our first night as we came back a second time just two days later before leaving Arizona.    Roasted Scallops were served with a vanilla cauliflower puree as smooth as mashed potatoes and a shaved fennel, watercress, and green apple salad for a bit of citrusy crunch.    Apple glazed pork tenderloin with a warm garnet yam salad and green beans was solid but in comparison to our other dishes was probably my least favorite.  I would go with the beef tenderloin over this one.   Grilled squash and goat cheese bread pudding wilted spinach, carrot jus, and the seasonal asparagus just had an amazing wow factor that we had to get it a second time.    Grilled beef tenderloin medallions truffle scented mac n cheese, carrots, small green beans, and a red wine reduction was the dish we wanted to try that prompted us to come back a second time as the table next to us raved about the flavor combination of the tenderloin and the truffle mac and cheese.  Conclusion, I agree 100%.  It absolutely blew the center cut filet we had at Barking Frog the day before out of the water.    Our server Craig was absolutely wonderful, hard working and personable making sure we were well taken care of without being intrusive that it left a memorable impression on us.  Overall, service here is great in general as Rex took great care of us as well the second time since Craig was off.    Although Chef Rusconi was off on Monday, they have a great 1/2 off bottle promotion for any wines with glass offerings.",

    "text": "Our first alert should have been when the hostess asked in a bored tone \"can I help you?\"... Yep, not very welcoming.   I said we would like a booth if available then she said they only had 'those' small high chair tables (by the door), as if she was trying to discourage us from staying.   I had seen that place for a few years but this was our first time there. The front is very small but the place is quite big. It has a nice ambiance and they seem to be very busy.   Our server was very nice and friendly but we felt quite neglected. He stopped by but did not take drinks order, we spent the night trying to get his attention and had to ask other people for drink, refill, etc. I stuck with water and hubby got a soda but getting refills was a pain. I even got my soup with no spoon and had to just stare at it for quite a while.   Hubby had the filet special, we asked our server if perhaps he should order a side if the special portion was small, but he said it was not small.  When it arrived we thought it was tiny, so as soon as we could get someone's attention we ordered a side of fingerling potatoes, which arrived not-promptly (by the end of his meal). However the cuteness factor was very high. They were served in a red tiny dish like a miniature Dutch oven. Not sure what is the name for that.   I ordered a cucumber/avocado cold soup with shrimp because I like avocado and shrimp (the one sans-spoon) and while it was OK I think it should be called cucumber/coconut, I did not taste even a hint of avocado and there was not much shrimp either.  I also had a hamburger with fries. The soup could have used some salt, and the fries were too salty. By the way, I did not see salt shakers and did not want to upset myself even more by trying to get one.   For dessert our server recommend the lemon budino and it was delicious.   Other than the soup the food was good but with the service we received this was not a good experience.  Anyone can have a bad day but we at least expect servers to acknowledge somehow when they are not meeting basic expectations.",

Happy hour ends at 6 pm but it is a fantastic happy hour. So you don't want to miss the specials. The wine list is superb and they can recommend a wine to suit your taste or pair with your meal. Any dish I have ever tasted has delighted my tastebuds. Scallops perfectly cooked, risottos wonderfully seasoned, daily chicken runs out fast, mouthwatering short ribs, and the desserts are a perfect finish. Great place to dine for any reason.

And during brunch they have $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's. Oh and if you are so inclined they also have half price bottles of wine. You would never expect what is inside this place from the outside but you will be thankful you tried it. Also the wait staff is incredible.

We are total foodies and this was on our top 5 list and my husband even recommended this restaurant to many of his out-of-town clients.   We went tonight to celebrate my son's completion of his first year of college. We ordered the short rib and shrimp appetizers. We have had the short rib before and it was not good tonight. We also did not enjoy the shrimp. They were both loaded in sauces and we all found it to be overwhelming. The smothering of sauces is definitely a new one for them as we have been here many times before. The presentation was very pretty but the dishes are not tasty anymore.  I ordered salmon, my husband ordered pork, my older son ordered mussels, and my younger son ordered the tenderloin. My salmon was room temperature and mediocre. My husband's pork was dry, and my older son's mussels were very fishy. My older son did order the budino (his favorite dessert) and it did not disappoint.   I would not recommend this place to anyone again. I don't know what happened but our experience was entirely disappointing all around.",

    "text": "We came for my mother-in-law's birthday and I made the reservation on Open Table. I arrived and took in the small, but neat dining/bar area. When our group arrived we were seated less than 20 feet from the bar in the \"dining area\". Did I mention we were the first and only ones in the restaurant at the time?  I told our young server that we were celebrating a special occasion. I believe she forgot because it wasn't brought up or addressed at any point during our time there. Our service was absolutely terrible the entire time we were there.   We noticed that it was \"happy hour\" which seemed like a great deal and asked our server if we could begin ordering beverages. She curtly told us, \"Actually, you can't order happy hour here, it's only at the bar.\" Fine. My husband was about to stand up to order our drinks at the bar and was stopped and told, \"No, you can't bring your drinks back to your table from the bar. I can't let you do that.\" We were shocked. The bar was less than 20 feet away. The restaurant is tiny. Our server was already being less than pleasant and we had come on recommendation from a friend who told us the food was stellar.   My husband and mother-in-law began to ask why we couldn't just order our drinks at the bar and bring them over to our table before dinner when our server sighed loudly (I wish I could make this up) rolled her eyes at us, and said, \"Can you hang on a minute?\" and walked away. She returned 5 minutes later with the manager (we hadn't made a big deal about anything, only wanted to ask why we couldn't order drinks for happy hour at the bar) and he began, \"I hate being the bearer of bad news, but I think I'm going to be. We don't want to ruin your dining experience by having you go back and forth to the bar to get drinks so we can't allow you to order them there. (IT WAS LESS THAN 20. FEET. AWAY) but we can break you up and sit you on high tops there..\" Who does that? Doesn't allow you to order at the bar while you're eating. And our waitress went out of her way to be rude to our table. At this point we were ready to leave, but we were starving, and gave in.   We ordered chicken salads, burgers, fries, a cheese dip... Waitress took our order by memory, forgot a few things, surprise surprise, and after coming back multiple times rather than just writing it down the first time, finally got it right. Food was decent, not fantastic. The best part of the meal was the truffle fries. We weren't apologized to, the birthday was forgotten.   There are far better restaurants in the area with incredible service, which truly defines your experience. We won't be back and will make sure to tell our friends and family about our terrible experience.",

Located on a shopping center you just don't expect it to be anything special.....but that it is. The hostess greeted our party and although we were early for our reservation- she seated us promptly. Decor is upscale modern- very nice. It was very busy yet able to carry on a conversation at our table. Our server, Jay, was charming. He asked if this was our first visit and took the time to explain the menu items. He was knowledgeable  about all the menu items and answered all questions we had.  My dining companion, a wine enthusiast, was very impressed with the wine list. We started with the Kitchen Board appetizer to compliment our wine.  Menu items are certainly different-we had  avocado and cucumber soup, figs stuffed with blue cheese wrapped in prosciutto , shrimp and grits,squash and goat geese bread pudding ( outstanding), duck confit and diver scallops. Everything was beautifully served, presentation outstanding but beyond that everything was just delicious! The desserts looked amazing so we orders 4! The warm chocolate bread pudding with homemade bourbon vanilla ice cream was incredible.  The portions are not huge....but because of this we were able to enjoy three courses and were full when we left. Hats off to Chef Michael!",

The panini was awful, not nicely grilled and cheesy, but plain, cold and hardly any filling. The salad was just field mixed greens and a few pine nuts. The greens were wilted and the stems were brown. Not fresh. The Parmesan fries were soggy not crispy. Very over-priced.  Our waiter was great, that star is for him.",

Their fries are fantastic! Go for the upgrade. Other people at my table ordered the lamb and said it was good and everyone said the soup are the best, but I haven't tried them, yet.

It's not a big draft list but the wine list is great. I had the filet medallions and my wife had the sustainable salmon. Both entres were seasoned well and the garnish complimented the proteins. Our biggest issue was that everthing was cold except for the salmon. It was obvious that the plates died at the pass waiting for the salmon. The manager bought us some ice cream for our troubles. My guess is that the execution is usually better than our experience. Don't pay for the ice cream. It is low quality ice milk. We might try again someday.",

There's nothing wrong with either of those cars but... they're just not at the same level.   The thing I like most about Rusconi's is that it has a hip, urban, modern vibe without being pretentious.   We came in on this day to check out the Restaurant Week offerings. Our server John, a really cool, friendly guy got us our drinks and we were off to the races.  I started with the Pan Roasted Gulf Shrimp and Yellow Polenta. Perfectly cooked shrimp, corn, bacon, delicious polenta. Score!   My main course was the Braised Beef Short Ribs with Roasted Garlic and Herb Spaetzle. I don't even know what a spaetzle is, but this dish was divine. The braised rib was melt in your mouth tender... and it was meat, which I love. The sherry jus that it's bedded in is so good too, great flavor. Everything worked together nicely.  Finally, my favorite part of any meal. Dessert. I went with the White Chocolate Budino. Yup, I have no idea what a budino is either, but again... home run. It tasted like a fancy pudding but with more consistency than pudding. Then there's the caramel and pecans which add to the texture and sweet goodness.  Side note: The Chocolate Bread Pudding was awesome too, even though I only got one bite...   Best Meal I've had in Phoenix to date. The service was on point from beginning to end as well. Each course was well timed (an art) and our glasses were always full.   If you haven't been here, I highly recommend this unassuming gem. Now excuse me while I go Google Spaetzle and Budino.",

This is the biggest fraud in bar tending and inexcusable when all i got was a cupful of ice and I was told they had to add more scotch so a $6 well was now $9. I should have refused. My bad. So instead of a second round and food, we finished our drinks and left. Poor management, and waiter training. He should have come back to my table and warned me on the upcharge as many other waiters have done when they have misled the customer. Oh well, they lost business tonight and never will we be back...adios Rusconi. Bs Rusconi's you put in no more than an ounce and a half and filled up the glass to the top with ice And the complaint was that your waiter should have told me the fraud you were Attempting and I would've changed to a nice wine",

I happened up this place because after dropping the toddler off we were desperate for a decent meal and some adult time.  I had never heard of this restaurant before and I drive by there often but I saw it had good reviews on Yelp and it was right during their happy hour time.  My husband and I were thrilled with the food we had, the prices were great and the service was attentive.  To start off our journey we ordered the American goat cheese and artichoke fondue with wood grilled flatbread.  Talk about creamy goodness that you can't stop eating, this is it.  You want to order this when you stop by, it warms you up and comforts your soul.  Then we tried out the slow roasted pork belly and shreiners sausage with poblano glaze, creamy polenta and grilled apple relish.  I am such a big fan of pork belly, I couldn't resist, the pork belly was crispy and popped with flavor.  Sharing the boneless beef short rib sliders with horseradish cream and smoke gouda, was hard because they're just that good.  Can I also say that I love their french fries!  I went back there for lunch not too long ago and enjoyed their roasted beef tenderloin with baby greens, fingerling potatoes, olives, green beans and onions.  So vibrant with color and taste.  I'll tell you what I tell all my friends, try it out!",

It made it a little difficult for my husband to eat and we didn't get to see as much of the beautiful restaurant as we would have liked. Also, my husband was a little sad that one of the pieces of \"lamb\" in his meal was actually a piece of fat and he was enjoying the dish so much he was disappointed it was gone. While all the food was very good I have to say I crave the piquello polenta. The way the flavors unfold in your mouth...it's just divine.  We loved it and we will be back!",

While dining at Rusconi's the other night and sitting close to the kitchen and being waited on by one of their best, Brian, Chef recognized us as frequent visitors and sent over a trio of desserts. By the way I had their duck breast special and it was off the chart good. The desserts were small servings of peach ice cream, a root beer float chilled dessert, and a tangerine basil sorbet. The last was even better than the previous two with flavors of basil infused through the sorbet and not just a garnish on top. All were spectacular. Not that we needed any reason to come back but truly proves again why this is a local favorite!",

We were immediately taken to our table by the restaurant manager, nice touch. The waiter quickly came over and asked if it was our first time there, and if he could be of assistance. It was for me and we even got a waiter's assistant to serve us refreshments before we could even ask for them. Now for the important part, the food (all of it) was spectacular! From the grilled asparagus appetizer to the grilled sustainable salmon for my date and the braised beef short ribs for me. We resisted dessert and as I write this review, I sincerely regret that decision. Go as I promise you will not regret it.",

I tried a bite of the short rib. Wholly Cow it was so tender with a great savory flavor. My aunt ordered a rare burger and it was rare! Which doesnt usually happen. For dessert we got the chocolate pecan pie on the house for my birthday. It was tiny but somehow it was enough for us all to split because it was so decadent. Only complaint was my margarita, it wasnt too great just alright. But when I tried their margarita on the drink menu with either jalepeno or habenero, now that was great! Very spicy though!",

    "text": "I would've given this place 5 stars if they did not forget about my husbands entree.  But he did truly try to make it up to us, so we're happy with that. I just didn't like that his reason wasn't truthful.  Hubs ordered the lamb, I ordered the NY Strip, son ordered the cheese pizza.  We started off with the Schreiner sausage and Pork Belly with polenta appetizer.  It was amazing.  The glaze and apples on the pork belly gave it such a flavorful twist.  I loved every bite.  My entree and my sons came out shortly after that.  We were told that hubs meal was on his way.  A couple moments later, the server came back and asked what the hubs ordered, to which he replied, the lamb.  Okay, so this clearly meant he forgot to put my hubs order in, right?  Why would he come back to ask again what he ordered?  For the next 25 minutes, the server came out about 5 times to let us know that his dish would be out shortly.  The server comp'd a beer for him for his patience.  Came out later and said the Chef messed up his lamb the first time and was trying to perfect it for him the 2nd time and that's why it's taking so long - this is when I knew it was a lie because if that were the case, he should've told us that instead of coming out and asking what he ordered.  Finally when I was practically done with my meal, his lamb came out.  Hubs said he was so hungry that even if the lamb was not good, he would still think it was great.  Our server also comp'd us dessert for the trouble (and because we were celebrating our anniversary) - which was a warm chocolate bread pudding with vanilla sauce and berries.  We gobbled that thing up - it was incredibly tasty - warm, moist and flavorful.  Tommy, the server, definitely was great, he was attentive and friendly - it just made me irritated that he just couldn't be honest in saying that he forgot to put our order in instead of saying the Chef messed up.  We would've been fine either way.    We'll definitely come back to this place.  But yes, I gave it 1 less star for lack of honesty even though we had good service and great food.  Oh, and there was bread?  We weren't offered any...",

The service was impeccable and the food was fresh and delicious.  Food: I ordered the Mediterranean Benedict which has prosciutto and tomatoes served on a thin ciabatta bread. The Benedict was served with a goat cheese hollandaise sauce and balsamic syrup. I'm not a goat cheese fan so substituted for regular hollandaise. The prosciutto was delicious and plentiful. The sauce was not too buttery and had great texture. My husband ordered the steak and eggs which came with filet medallions and raved about. Good kids menu, well priced and nice selection. $5 mimosas and bloody Mary's, both very good. A few us then split the stuff French toast with berries and marscopone cheese. Oh my goodness was that heaven!!! I should have taken a picture, but we all dug in too quickly.  Service: Stellar! It's not easy having a party of 14 and kids being included. Super nice waiter and quick to address any needs we had. Also, provided awesome recommendations.   Love this place! We will be sure be back for brunch.",

There was one table available but we were told it was too small for 3 people and it was reserved.  So the hostess said our disabled friend could sit as the bar.  There is no way she could do that.  I asked for the manager and asked him if he could accommodate us.  Plenty of tables in the dining room but they could not go against policy and seat us there.  The manager asked another table of two   people to move from the four top to a two top and gave us their table in the happy hour area.  Hard and fast rules at Rusconi's.",

The menu included a glass of wine. However, I am not able to drink alcohol so he was able to get the bartender to make a non-alcoholic berry drink that is similar to a mojito. It was wonderful!   First course: pan roasted gulf shrimp and linguica. It was so good! The green chili risotto and corn was a great touch with the shrimp.   Second course: pecan wood grilled flat iron steak. Again, the flavor was amazing and I appreciated the goat cheese dumplings and spaghetti squash.   Third course: hazelnut eclair. This is where the food fell short and why I deduct one star. The dessert was bland and tasted like it came from a grocery store. I would not recommend.   Overall, I am glad I came to dine at Rusconi's. I plan to visit again!",

Really, really good food. Could see the chef finalizing preparation for all the dishes to make sure they came out well. Great prix fixe menu with excellent gazpacho, an incredibly tasty ossobuco, and some great homemade ice cream. Great value for the quality of food you receive. Wouldn't hesitate to come back!",

The muscles are the best! I lived in Seattle 7 years and never had fresher, plumper muscles! The specials are special. Scallops delicious. Savory bread pudding is great.   Just go. Try it.

They offer a tasty brunch as well.   We came in this afternoon (Saturday) around 4:45 and were promptly seated at a high top table behind the hostess stand in the bar area. At this point the bar was relatively full and there were a couple other tables seated in the area. About five minutes in to our wait, the server of the other seated tables in the area looked over and said he'd be back shortly. For the next 15 minutes we waited as he attentively addressed the needs of the other tables without even stopping by to take our drink order. At that point, we decided our money would be better spent at a restaurant across the street and walked out the door. An unfortunate first for me.",

    "text": "Overpriced and underwhelming.  I saw all the great reviews and thought I'd take my family here for Mother's Day brunch. When we were seated and handed the menu, we noticed there was a prix fixe menu. Adults got three courses for $58. Kids got eggs, bacon, and roasted potatoes plus desert for $18 and drinks were extra. $18 BUCKS for that was a joke, it should be under $10 with a drink.    The adult meal was weird and hard to pair some of the starters with the main courses. My wife had a lobster bisque that was ok, probably a little too creamy and no chunks of lobster or anything other than some seafood flavor to indicate it was actually made with lobster.  She also got steak and eggs as her main course and it was fine, but nothing special.  I got a short rib and grits for my starter, which had good flavor and was very tender. My entree was a crab and shrimp benedict that was very fishy. The roasted potatoes were nothing to write home about. I also got a bloody mary, which was very basic and reminded me of one I'd get on an airplane.  When the $197 bill arrived, I was appalled to pay that for two adults and two kids. Toss in tip (service was good) and we spent $240 on a meal that was underwhelming at best. Unfortunately, this restaurant did not come close to my expectations and I don't see myself returning.",

    "text": "I am always looking for restaurants where the chefs are culinary artists and the prices are not exorbitant.  A long-time prototype of this genre is Rancho Pinot, but Rusconi's is similar in approach, slightly less expensive, and almost as good.  The keys are flavor profiles and appealing presentations.  A lot of cooks can put four things on a plate, each of which is good, but making them complement one another is a skill.  Take Rusconi's shrimp and grits appetizer.  The addition of some small oblongs of sausage and of cherry tomatoes for an acidic note was genius, accenting superbly the perfectly grilled shrimp and creamy grits.  Similar complements could be paid to our other selections with a special nod to the scallops for flawless preparation and a large portion.  The atmosphere is modern with just the right level of buzz, without being noisy, the service is very professional, and the check ended up being about $50 per person (one drink, appetizer, entree, shared dessert) including tax and tip.",

House salad was a wonderful change from  the norm, where the salad was enhanced with pine nuts, thinly sliced Italian hard cheese,  and wonderful sherry vinaigrette.  The short rib sandwich was wonderful with the flavors of the ribs being balanced with the arugula.  The waiter was knowledgable about the wines and  we enjoyed a nice Pinot Gris, (Willakenzie) and a very nice Pinot Noir (Laetitia Arroyo Grande)",

We finished with a dark chocolate bread pudding. Nice twist to the usual \"old person dessert\". We also had the creme brulee. The service was seamless.

We all agreed the Beef Tenderloin Medallions with truffle mac and cheese was the best even though we all enjoyed our dishes. I had the Fresno Kid cocktail which was fantastic! The guys had old fashions and said they were spot on. The service was exceptional and our waiter Fitz was a blast. Very attentive and funny. Highly recommend this place!",

When we stepped in here we were told we would have over a 2 hour wait but.... if we could find space at the bar we could order dinner from there too. We looked at the bar just as two spots opened up and jumped at them.  From that point on everything was perfect. I had medallions of beef on a bed of truffle mac and cheese and my friend had a sort of savory bread pudding thing made with squash. I seldom get dessert but the Brie cheesecake sounded intriguing so we split it and it was fantastic.  Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us decide on our food/drink orders. Even though the place was full up there was none of the out of control pandemonium that sometimes occurs in places that are busy.  From a budget standpoint I would say plan on $50 person with an entree, a drink, a shared dessert and tip.",

For entrees, I had the rack of lamb special with pea risotto and carrots while my dining partner had the pork osso bucco, an on-menu item with spaetzel, prickly pear purple cabbage and asparagus.  Each entree was perfectly cooked and excellent.  The only waiters were classy, the full meal was served promptly and was clearly made fresh, and we had a great time.  Solid 5 stars.",

We enjoyed a few glasses of wine at a discount- and jumped right into dinner.  Our server notified us that there was one Monkfish Special left if we wanted to reserve it.  Before he could finish his sentence I was in!  Love Monkfish-and it is hard to find in the valley.  It was succulent and lobster like-just as I desire.  It was served with a creamy risotto-perfectly cooked.  One of my friends ordered the Scallops-and they tasted like they were just scooped out of the sea.  Our server was relaxed, informed and allowed us to leisurely enjoy our meal.  Quite a romantic spot-time to invite my hubby for Date Night!",

So we made a reservation for 4 at 8:00 on Saturday night and met up with her sister and husband.  We arrived 5 minutes before 8, and I can tell they were busy cause the place will packed and there were several couples waiting in front of us.  We were told they are running a little behind and its going to be a few minutes, well we didn't want to make a big scene, but that's the purpose why we made a reservation, is so we don't have to wait so long.  Finally at 8:25 we were seated at our table.  From that point on the service and food was outstanding.  Our waiter was very personable and did a great job.  We ordered the shrimp with risotto for our appetizer and I ordered the \"kitchen burger\" medium rare and my wife ordered the mussels.  Both dishes were cooked very well and we really enjoyed them.  My brother in law and his wife ordered the same thing.  As we finished our meals, the head chef came over and apologized for the long delay at the beginning and offered us complimentary dessert on them.  It was a very kind gesture  and since my wife is pregnant she really appreciated it.  They offered up 4 desserts for the table to share. We thought all of them were great, but the bread pudding really stood out.  Overall, it started out with a little hiccup, but the staff really shined though and made the dinner experience wonderful.  My brother in law and wife are regulars at this place, and I would definitely  be back and recommend to others.",

The short rib appetizer is not as stellar as the mac and cheese but it's pretty good still. The tenderloin main that comes with the mac and cheese is great, obviously.   Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese",

The layout is inviting and simply designed. The hostess was very friendly and accommodating when I asked for a different table.   I worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and am a food snob (so I'm told).  With that said, my server Brian, made the entire experience perfection. I always believe you should trust your server because they eat the food the most!  But if you add the fact that Brian is also a passionate chef and knowledgable of the product, I didn't even have to look at the menu. I was sold.   Everything he suggested was fabulous and it was enjoyable to hear him explain the items in detail. The wines were a perfect pair to our food. He was on point!  If you visit this place ask for him!  My client was slap happy when we left and that makes me happy!  I will definitely go back",

Big groups should be seated away from kitchen, smaller groups of two or three are fine.  Food quality was great, for that alone I would give 4 stars or more.  But the review was about total experience. I would highly recommend larger groups to not sit beside the kitchen to have a very positive dining experience.",

We started out wanting to order the mussels appetizer but they had no mussels, it happens. We ordered the chili tomato fondu, it was uninspiring and had very little taste.  Secondly we all had the Arugula salad, very tasty but also very small.  For our main courses two of us ordered the Short Ribs while two of us ordered the glazed Pork. The short ribs came with chilli grits that were again bland, but the pork ribs were cooked perfectly. The glazed pork was very good though the portion was again not as large as I would have expected. We ended with the Brie cheesecake which I though was a little dry.  Overall an ok place but only if your in the neighborhood.",

The first time we ordered the paella and what we got was a small bowl of watery rice with tiny pieces of chorizo, a little bit of shredded chicken, two or three shrimp and mussels. The flavor was very bland - not awful just not very good.  They need to raise the price and add more protein and flavor.  Our friend ordered the burger medium rare and it was well done. This week I ordered the scallops. The server was happy to substitute some roasted veggies for the spaetzel that it comes with. I was served three nice sized scallops and a small amount of spinach and roasted veggies, probably less than a cup. The scallops were delicious but it would have been nice to have more veggies so that I left feeling full.  I will stick with The Greene House for scallops where you get 4 large scallops and a large amount of veggies for the same $24. My husband had the flatbread pizza with sausage and said it was good. We really want this restaurant to succeed so we will give it a little more time and try it again.",

I also tried the creme brulee for dessert which was also fantastic. ...and to think this restaurant is walking distance from my home.  I will be back.",

    "text": "After a long and disappointing day driving out to the Grand Canyon and being rained out, we pulled into Rusconi's starving and underdressed.  NEVER did they make us feel less than welcome, and our server, Hannah, was awesome and knowledgeable!  The food was superb--we started with the white truffle mac and cheese, which I hesitated to order after his highness Gordon Ramsay pilloried white truffle oil, but my kids wanted it, so they beat Lord Swears-alot hands down.  It was great, and just the right amount.  Each of my kids then had the kitchen burger, which was ground in-house, layered with goat cheese, carmelized balsamic onions and tomato jam, and cooked perfectly to medium-well and medium-rare (my son likes his rarer than my daughter!); I had the buffalo sirloin steak with fingerling potatoes, also cooked medium rare, perfectly and uniformly prepared.  The wine reduction was so savory I felt like licking the plate!  Funny enough, the place started to clear out rapidly, and we looked down to our phones to see that there was a sandstorm warning!  Hannah explained that it's a pretty serious thing, so we expedited our leaving and headed back to the hotel!  My only wish is that we'd been offered the summer tasting menu (a steal at $40!), which I only discovered after looking at their website afterwards...  All in all, still a great experience!  Will definitely be back next time we're in Phoenix!",

We had 6 people and each of our dishes came out absolutely fantastic.  I feel confident saying I know food and good food. I'm allergic to one thing and that's bad food.  The buffalo entree was juicy, done medium rare as requested (a simple request that so many restaurants simply don't follow well), Paella was moist and hearty, shortrib was fall-off-the-bone tender, Scallop was done to perfection.  Mussels appetizer is a MUST!  Chef came to the table at the end to check on us.  A nice touch that I hope he continues as this place gets more busy.  And I don't see why it won't. Definitely will go back!  I want to give it 5 stars but the wait staff needs just a little fine tuning.  They were very nice and enthusiastic but were very forgetful of alot of small requests like pepper and bringing the drink menus.  Minor but for a local place, customer service is paramount along with good food.  4.5 stars!",

    "text": "This restaurant is just what we needed in Paradise Valley!!  We first ate here July 25th, 2013 & we had a great time & enjoyed the camaraderie with the staff & among the patrons as well.  It's a lively place but not a nightclub.  There is ample bar area seating with a flatscreen TV (where we chose to eat) & the restaurant is larger than appears from the outside.  The kitchen is clean & very organized (& it was humming on this particular night) which is certainly a plus as it is open & visible from most tables.  The menu consists of delectables such as cream of asparagus soup, creative salads & top-notch gourmet entrees (Osso Bucco, Beef Tenderloin, Salmon & a hearty burger).  The bartender also has skills - cocktails range from the classics to the more trendy & there's a lot of them - specialties are written on a chalkboard just behind the bar & are solid & original.  On the particular night we dined (a Thursday night), the place was packed & it appeared they may not have been ready for the onslaught - the staff was thinly stretched but handled the chaos with aplomb.  Our entrees took a little bit longer than expected but we enjoyed ourselves during the wait because of the happy atmosphere with its slightly-rugged decor & delicious aromas wafting about.  The wine list is more than satisfactory & they have an extensive list of top-notch brands for any discernible palate.  Rusconi's will definitely be our go-to place in the neighborhood - with their great gourmet menu & casual vibe, who wouldn't love this place?!  The only thing that would make it better would be some good jazz (like Mindy Abair, Dave Koz or Euge Groove) piped in over a speaker or two - but maybe with all the energetic banter going on in the place, you might not hear it.",

    "text": "We had seen a lot of good reviews of this place.   It was very hard to find since it is sandwiched between a Panda Express and a Coreleones which both have bright signs that overwhelm the Rusconi sign.  First sat at the bar waiting for my wife to arrive.  The Bartender was great.  I ordered a couple of things off the happy hour menu as my wife called to say she was going to be late.  The Kitchen Board was a good price on happy hour but I was very disappointed by the cheese selection, cheese curds and some small triangles of a sage cheddar.   I also had the Mussels which were very flavorful but only four of them.   Now it was the happy hour order so I hope there are more on the regular seeing as they are $17.  We ordered a set menu which was $40 per person for 5 courses.  First up was an avocardo soup. While the soup was very well prepared it lacked in flavor. The second course was a salad with shrimp which I found to be very good but my wife found the dressing to be a little overpowering.  The salad had shrimp on it that looked like they had been sliced to give the appearance of more.  Third course was scallops with grits.  Nice dish but my scallops had grains of sand in them.   Fourth course is where things started to go wonky. I will say at this point that the Chef and owner was the expediter.   All the servers had to go through him to get extras like salt.  The fourth course was a lamb porterhouse.  I asked if I could get some mint Jelly with mine.  I was told that there was no mint jelly so I asked if they had mint sauce.  No to that too.  My daughter ordered her's medium rare and it came out medium well. I ordered mine medium and it came out medium well.  My wife ordered medium well and it came out medium well.  I was ok with mine but my daughter sent her's back. The chef looked very annoyed both at the request for mint jelly and the lamb being sent back.  My daughter's lamb was returned rare, I mean it had been charred on the outside but was uncooked in the center.   We made them aware but did not sen it back.  The kicker was the desert.  Ahead of time we asked if we could have some ice cream with the desert and were told yes by the server.  The chocolate bread pudding arrived sans ice cream.  We decided we would wait.  After 5 minutes we called the server back and asked where the ice cream was.  He went back to the chef who was shaking his head.  When the server came back he said they had ice cream but we could not have any.  We said we would pay extra if that was the issue.  The server said that was not the issue.  He did not say what the issue was but I guess it was the arrogance of the chef not wanting his dishes altered.   Was the desert good? OH YES IT WAS.   But I have to give a lot of negative marks for the arrogance which I think was the reason for the limited cheese, limited number of mussels, raw lamb and ice cream being withheld.  Overall good service from the staff, pretty good food, but an arrogant chef. I will go back to see if it was perhaps just an off night.",

We really enjoyed our dinners (strip steak and lamb) and the salty/caramel/custard dessert special was absolutely to die for - a discreet little concoction that arrives in a small jar.

Not a problem, though.  Our waiter was very attentive at first, but then was a bit hard to find. I think he had too many tables in the busy back.  Thoroughly enjoyed our meals. For me, a non-meat eater (and the menu does lean towards meat and chicken), the Ravioli on veggies with Goat Cheese was excellent. Al dente, even needing a knife assist, but not under-done. My wife had the Ntural Chicken dish - looked very meaty and moist. Our friends had the mussels and the Osso Bucco.  Let's put it this way - not a scrap left on any plate! But alas, no room for the desserts that looked so good. Maybe next time. And there will be a next time.  And a nice bonus - moderate cost. WIth a bottle of wine, $65 per couple, incl tax and tip.",

If you want to try this place on a weekend evening, make sure you plan accordingly.  The reason? This place is amazing!  We decided to come for dinner for the hubby's birthday instead.  We tried the cheese plate as well as the macaroni for our appetizers (giving the macaroni to the child which she promptly scarfed) and had two delicious dinners.  I had the buffalo steak and the hubby had roasted chicken.  Both of us cleaned our plates and to say we enjoyed our meal would be an understatement.  There were a lot of sounds coming out of me that I don't usually find myself making at restaurants. The desert was by far the best part, though.  We had the bread pudding and even after we had practically licked the plate clean we were still ravenous for more.  It was beyond delicious and I cannot wait to come back and eat it again.  The drinks were also top notch, something the hubby appreciated. This place is a must visit; often if your pocketbook can spare it.",

    "text": "Decided on Rusconi's for a group dinner of 6 people; I called the day before to make the reservation. The man I spoke to said they were a little booked, but could accommodate us on the patio; I said no problem. Well, upon arriving the next night, we were told by the hostess that she couldn't find the reservation. I explained to her the conversation I'd had the evening before and almost immediately she went wide eyed and started to apologize. Basically, there had been a miscommunication on their end and early in the day, she had cancelled our reservation by accident.  As soon as she realized the mistake, she went to talk to her manager about how to fix the situation. After a little waiting maybe 10-15 minutes (another table had to clear out), we were escorted to a table right next to the kitchen. The restaurant is much smaller than I thought it would be, but it was elegantly decorated and very nice.  Right away, the manager sent over 2 of the \"kitchen board\" appetizers to further beg pardon for the mix up. It was filled with a selection of delicious cheeses, meats, bread and pickled veggies. I was especially impressed with the duck they served, as it was \"smoked\" underneath an upside lowball glass . Right before they serve it to you, the chef actually takes smoke and pipes it into the glass, filling it up so you can't see the meat. Then, they serve it to you, the waiter removes the glass and you consume. And you could definitely taste the smoke (in a good way).  Afterwards, our main courses arrived and all at our table were satisfied. Between us we tried the: tenderloin beef medallions, veggie & goat cheese ravioli, roasted chicken, blackberry glazed salmon and a massive cheese burger. All agreed that the food was super delicious. I can only speak for the beef but it was truly amazing. Easily one of the best cooked pieces of meat I've ever had. Truffle mac & cheese was fantastic too, as were the carrots with a yummy glaze.  All in all, a great experience. Could have gone the other way, but Rusconi's handled it perfectly. It's a little out the way for me to eat there too regularly (although I licked my plate clean and it was not a small portion, so maybe that's a good thing). However, I will definitely be back for another special occasion!",

Where were you in 2013?  Consistently good food.  Always a couple of favorites on the menu with a few featured/specials/seasonal items peppered in.  Everything is very good.  Prices are really reasonable.  We had the scallops and the buffalo sirloin this time with, my favorite, a side of prickly pear cabbage (please don't ever take that off your menu).  Total dinner price for two entrees, a side and (non-alcocholic) drinks = ~$60.  Can't beat that!",

    "text": "I found the little hole in the wall through Yelp and I'm glad I did! From the outside it's nothing spectacular and wouldn't go there to sit on the patio as it over-looks a parking lot. Once walking through the door it was immediately apparent this wasn't just a hole in the wall but a hidden gem. Inside the restaurant opened-up into an open kitchen and great little dining room.   We sat at a small table across from the bar and were immediately greeted by the bartender (I think his name was Bobby). Since we had already had drinks and appetizers elsewhere we were slow to order drinks, Bobby saw I was having trouble finding a drink (They don't have much Rum there) so he brought me a small snifter of what he called moonshine and it was delicious! Although I didn't order any cause I needed to drive home, just the thought of letting me try something that was specific to his bar was awesome. BTW it wasn't like drinking rubbing alcohol, it was really really good and if I didn't need to drive home I would have had a whole glass!  For dinner we asked Bobby for recommendations and without hesitation he said the Bison Sirloin, I hadn't even looked at it but since he was so confident I'd like it that's what I chose. The other meal was the House Burger and it was obviously hand-made there and even though simple was a great meal! Both dishes were cooked perfectly, I would have only asked for a little more sauce to dip my bison in. Overall both meals were fantastic as was the service during the meal.  If you're looking for a little place with great service and an interesting menu try this restaurant!",

Refusing that undesirable location, the manager advised us that he could provide a different location in five to ten minutes.  Five minutes by the clock, we were shown to a private table in the rear of the restaurant.   Service was attentive and solicitous all evening.  Hard to imagine some Yelpers being put off by the \"intrusive\" service.  Our waiter was happy (imagine that) and did a most professional job.  The risotto with duck and sherry jus was excellent, and disappeared quickly.  My wife had the filet medallions, perfectly prepared; only complaint the size of the entree.  No such issue with my Pork Osso Buco.  Succulent meat served with delicious pricky pear braised cabbage and garlic herbed spaetzle.  Extremely large portion.  Large and representative wine list, in price order.  The restaurant is loud, if you desire a quiet dinner, this is not the place.  But if you want excellent food, at a more than fair price point, attentive service, and a lively atmosphere, you'll be more than satisfied, I'm sure.",

The waiter went on and on with the most annoying jokes and doubled down with more after he picked up on how flat they fell.    Osso buco (great spelling check there....Yelp is changing it to \"pass buck\") was dried out.  Maybe over cooked but honestly it felt reheated....probably not but it was of different consistencies and just sucked.  The same comment was made by the other person that ordered it too.

It's hard to do pan roasted bone-in chicken to order. The group I was with all loved their dishes. The apps we got were good including the \"kitchen board.\"  So I went again tonight with my husband and we enjoyed our meals very much. In fact, we loved them! We started with the fondue. It was very tasty. They served it with grilled bread which I love. My husband got the Scottish salmon with blackberry sauce. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, as ordered. Delicious! I got the beef medallions with the truffle mac and cheese. It was awesome! My beef was cooked perfectly medium rare and the mac and cheese was delicious. It was flavorful and unusually light for such a rich side dish. It wasn't all thick and gummy like mac and cheese can tend to be. My only criticism was that both dishes, salmon and beef medallions including their accompaniments, needed a tad more salt. Otherwise they were near perfect! For dessert we shared the dark chocolate bread pudding. Oh so light in texture, bold chocolatey flavor with a creamy vanilla sauce on the bottom. I've had their budino before and it's great too!  I would give this place 5 stars but since the food was lacking in seasoning just slightly I gave it 4 stars. Overall so glad we found this place. It's got great food, modern but simple decor and it's close to home. Yay!!",

Great value and nice atmosphere.  Very friendly service and nice to see a non-chain restaurant in our neighborhood.  Next time we'll try the highly recommended truffled mac-n-cheese.",

The burgers are always a good choice, and come with a generous portion of fries cooked perfectly. My brother had the salmon which was superb, and even the Brussel Sprouts were great!. We topped it off with an ice cream/sorbet trio which was divine.   The service here is consistently about perfect, and Management here is EXCELLENT. If a problem should ever arise, they understand how to resolve and take take care of the customers as few establishments do throughout the country.  I highly recommend this great, locally owned and independent restaurant.",

That said, we decided to wait for another table to open up even though we had reservations. They were able to seat us in a less congested and noisy area in about 15 minutes. The service at the table was simply outstanding. I had the Hook & Ladder Chardonnay and it was very good. Their wine selection is very good. My friend ordered the Salmon and she thought it was extremely tasty. My husband had the braised short ribs that I've ordered in the past and said they melt in your mouth--knives need not apply! I tried something new--the veggies with bread pudding. I have to say the bread pudding with goat cheese was pretty tasteless, so I would not recommend it. Overall, this place aims to please and I even got a follow up call the next day to see how we liked the restaurant. Impressive!",

Our server was fantastic...believe his name was Craig..but not sure ...very personable guy...and very good at his job.  The food was crazy delicious ...so much so that for the first time in 30 years I did not offer my husband a bite of my salmon with Blackberry glaze. I could not put my fork down it was soooooo good .  My husband ordered the chicken salad and loved every bite as well.  After explaining how much we loved our food to our server he apparently relayed this to the chef and in turn offered us their most popular dessert of choclate bread pudding ... I'm not crazy about bread pudding but again this was amazing ... We...meaning I...finished almost the entire thing making us late to our game...so worth it !!  I'm not sure why anyone would give less than 5 stars to this restaurant ...its outrageously good...sadly we live in southern california so we won't be able to be a regular here...but it will no doubt be the reason for a trip back to Phoenix in the future ! Thank you for giving us a customer experience worth sharing....hands down best part of our trip to arizona!",

I ordered grilled salmon, salmon was cooked perfectly, very moist, sauce served with salmon had a good flavor, nicely complimented the salmon.   Best part was desert. It wasn't too sweet, had just right amount of sweetness to it, I could have easily had two servings.  Nice ambiance, clean, tasteful decor, everything was great except a server. She smiled only from out of obligation. Since her service was slow, I watched her at other tables, she seemed genuinely nice to them and attentive. I felt like she purposely ignored our table, and we really had to go out of way to get her service.   So unfortunate that I liked their food but service was too slow and not so friendly.",

You walk inside and forget your next to Panda Express :)  Other pluses: green apple sorbet, adding two delicious scallops to my plate and the spetzel and red cabbage on my dish could have stood on their own.

We were able to make brunch reservations which were followed up with an email reminder.  Upon arrival our table was waiting and so was the personal service. We lingered unhurried over mimosas and bloody Mary's before making our selections from a menu that included appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, pancakes and omelettes. My delectable omelette was fluffy and filled with shrimp, vegetables and cheese with a moderate portion of fingerling potatoes.  My aunt chose simple eggs which she reported were cooked to perfection. Our attentive waiter, Fritz, was friendly and efficient    He made it a fun experience. The price range was reasonable for the ambiance (quite chatter), immaculate environment and creative food with appealing  presentation. We cannot wait to return for their happy hour  (Monday - Friday 4-6).  We peeked at the menu and drink list and it looks like a new favorite!!!",

His goal appeared to be how many people he could get in and get out as quickly as possible.  The wild arugula and frisee salad was a huge disappointment.  Very small size, like a side salad, and only 3 tiny pieces of beets.  Flavor was ok. Others enjoyed their ribs, and chicken.  The noise level was so high it was difficult to carry on a conversation.  That, along with the rushed feeling we all got, plus the prices a bit on the high side, we won't be going back.",

Located in a strip mall next to Panda Express, not a visual delight at first. When you walk in it seems small but after the first 4 tables across from the bar the room opens up. We had a 6pm reservation and were seated on time. Our table was literally the first by the front door separated by a pane of glass. Our waiter was fun and energetic (wish I remembered his name) and told us the evenings' specials. Heirloom beet salad with bleu cheese crumbles, asparagus soup and cauliflower soup were our first courses. So delicious. My husband and Dee had the NY Strip med/rare, Tom had scallops and I had the tenderloin medallions and chose garlic mashed. All the beef plates were cooked perfectly , so tender. My only complaint is they do not carry a Moscato wine. Dessert was the chocolate bread pudding with a vanilla sauce that was incredible even though I was so full. The NY strip was $42 and came with a mushroom risotto, the medallions were less and the scallops $23. Pretty good value for the price. I would definitely go back and of course recommend a reservation. #fourfinickyfoodies",

We love our neighbors and felt like we haven't seen them for quite a while so we asked them to join us. Plus, they were the ones that recommended this restaurant to us before. Brian and I started off with the goat cheese and charred tomato fondue. It was yummy but I think I'll have to try some other appetizers next time - like the crab cake special if it's still around. Bummed I didn't get it because I love crab cakes!   For my entree, I got the special - some sort of monkfish with saffron risotto? It was absolutely delicious! Brian got the short rib entree and said he really enjoyed it as well. I wish I had a picture of his dish. One of the neighbors ordered the kitchen sink burger and a side salad instead of fries. The salad looked mighty yummy.   For dessert, they had a Girl Scouts cookie item on the menu. It was a Samoa cookie pecan pie covered with berries and drizzled with some berry syrup. Hopefully, I can convince him to bring me here for Valentine's Day because there are so many things I want to try!",

Despite our underdressed appearance, there was zero snobbery from the staff and only welcoming smiles, jokes, and many laughs (may have been wine-induced).   Sundays are 1/2 off bottles of wine so obviously we got one. It's the proper post-hike hydration right? We started with the kitchen board which was a charcuterie with a hearty portion of meats and pickled veggies. The fat kid in me wanted a little more cheese though. Our entrees were the duck, the steamed mussels, and the beef tenderloin medallions. All three were delicious, fresh, and gone in 10 min flat.   Next was dessert - do yourself a favor and get the dark chocolate bread pudding. Our waiter said \"it's so good you'll want to fly back from Sacramento to eat it again tomorrow\" and it's True. I'm still thinking about it. And this meal was 2 weeks ago. It's that good.",

I have to laugh at the reviewer who gave Rusconi's a 1 Star review because the server asked how everyone is... LOL!!!   \"One Star\" Really??  Although, I do like to read 1 Star reviews because It's funny to read what people's image of their position in the universe is   Anyway, the service is great and I do prefer that the server/bartender does check in on me to make sure that everything came out as ordered.",

The place had started to thin out but I was promptly greeting by a duo up front and  proceeded to the bar. Erin was the bartender that evening and gave me a run down of the beers. After reading previous rave reviews of the Medallions over mac and cheese I had to try it. The kitchen staff was on point and my food was out in no time. The beef medallions were cooked perfectly to my request and the mac was incredible. I let Erin talk me in to the chocolate bread pudding for desert with no regrets. It was a perfect cap to dinner. Excellent staff with great vibes. Loved the smell of the pecan wood burning under the grill. Thanks for a great experience see you guys next time!",

    "text": "I ordered the same meal I had last year and it wasn't BAD but it wasn't as good either. Last year I had the Brunch Salmon plate. (see photos) Last year it was nice and succulent. This year for dinner it was a smaller portion that was cooked just OK and was topped with Blackberry Glaze and oily fried cilantro. The vegetables under it weren't so tasty. I had slightly burnt tasting brussels sprouts a few over cooked carrot slices and one and one half fingerling potatoes. Maybe I'm old fashioned but when I go out to dinner I expect to receive at least a female weight watcher portion of food. That means I expect 4-5 oz of protein, half a cup of vegetables and 3 oz of potato. That one and one half fingerling potato sort of insulted me. Could you imagine having a dinner party and serving your guest only one and one half fingerling potatoes a person?  We started with the White Truffle Scented Mac-N-Cheese. It lacked Cheese and wasn't cheesy enough and the Truffle aroma didn't bring anything to the party. The pasta was slightly over done. I would not recommend this dish to anyone.  My husband had the Pork Osso Bucco. He said the braised cabbage was very good and the Osso Bucco was seasoned nicely but it wasn't as tender as they usually are. He also said the mashed potatoes were a little bland.  We shared a deep chocolate Bread Pudding with vanilla ice cream. I will say the vanilla sauce on the bread pudding was very good. I'm sure the bread pudding was home made but it had a flavor to it that tasted like cake mix to me. I liked the shaved white chocolate topping on it.  Service was good during most of dinner but at the end it turned diner style. Our waiter placed the check on the table with a dessert and didn't ask me if I wanted coffee or an after dinner drink.   2.5 Stars",

My friend and I split the pork belly and sausage appetizer, which was fantastic. He  then had the squash soup and I had the blue cheese salad. Both were perfectly executed.  For the entree, he had steak and I had the tenderloin. Both were mouth wateringly delicious.  For dessert, we shared the pudding. It was some of the most amazing pudding I've ever had in my life.  Yes, this place is in a strip mall. But no, it doesn't feel like you're in a strip mall when you walk in. And no, once you sit down, you feel as if you've been transported to an uptown gastropub.  The only negative thing I can say was that service was a bit slow. Our server had a ton of tables, so maybe a server called in sick or something. But we still were treated well, even if we had to wait a little longer than we though we should.  I bookmarked this place and will not only be back, but I'll bring friends with me. This place is a gourmet gem not to be overlooked!",

    "text": "It's not often I give a restaurant 5 stars but Rusconi's American Kitchen earned one. Recommended by some friends we decided to have dinner here on our last night in town. Clearly don't get swayed by the store front of the building or the fact that it's in a strip mall and next door to a sandwich shop. Once you step inside the door you'll be pleasantly surprised and understand what I'm talking about.   The inside of the restaurant has a warm feeling and the smell of wood fire and delicious food will quickly overwhelm you. The acoustics are perfect too. A little noise but not too much and you can easily carry on a conversation.  Our group decided on a variety of items on the menu. We started with the Artisan cheese. A generous assortment of meats, cheese, olives and roasted peppers. It was accompanied with grilled crostini. For entrees I just couldn't resist their version of a meatless lasagna. It's nothing like what you might expect. It's a tasty dish with a variety of veggies along with a few sheets of homemade pasta. It was delicious and something I could eat every night!  My hubby ordered the roasted salmon. The glaze was sweet and the \"mixture of tastes and textures was an amazing combination\". Others tried the mushroom soup and commented, \"the best they'd ever had\". The seared scallops were \"incredible\" and served on top of a bed of cauliflower puree. Service was exceptional and each one of our dishes was prepared perfectly.  This place is a gem. Certainly a winner in every category for me.",

I had the grilled salmon, cooked perfectly, and asked to substitute spinach in place of potatoes, which was no problem.  My husband had steak and scallops on a bed of green pea risotto.  The risotto was unbelievable.  My daughter had to have the truffled garlic Parmesan French fries, and had to fight off her dad!  She also had grilled salmon.  For dessert we shared a watermelon sorbet, which tastes exactly the way a watermelon is supposed to taste except with the seeds and rinds! In short, a perfect finish to a perfect dinner.  Cool vibe-lots of energy but not too loud.  We will be back with business clients in a few weeks!",

Chicken was OK, salad was good, burger was to have no onion on it, but onion came on it so they removed the onion and brought it back! They brought us 4 desserts, but restaurants don't understand we like to go out for a meal that should be better than what I can make. This was not the situation tonite. The dessert did not sweeten an otherwise mediocre dinner.

The decor is charming and very well thought out. The design features an open kitchen, which we were seated near, but we never had a problem with too much noise. Our server welcomed us with a \"Happy Anniversary\" and was exceptionally attentive. The chef, who's from Chicago, stopped by the booth and talked with us for several minutes. The food (I had the Scottish salmon; my husband, the sea bass) was delicious. They've only been open about seven months but were decently busy for a Monday night.  The menu is not large but it IS varied - everything from Buffalo Sirloin to rack of lamb, scallops, etc. And the wine list is similarly not broad but excellent.   Our server said that on Friday and Saturday nights it's best to make a reservation; we had one for Monday but probably didn't need it.   Highly recommend and if we lived in Phoenix we'd definitely go back often. As it is, we're in Georgia and will have to rely on our AZ friends to help keep Rusconi's open.

We were dressed like humans, had no strange growths or odors emanating, and I asked my friend who is a lot more accommodating than I, apparently, if this was OK and she didn't want to fuss. They had room to accommodate us at a 4 top and squished us into the last 2 top against a wall. No grand rush came in the time we were there so I can't explain the seating.   The server was genial and made personal recommendations when asked,  I don't fault him. My friend said the coffee was good and she had a salad. I had a chile pork sandwich which had zero nuance of chile. I give them applause for the fries, they were crunchy and delicate and very good. For the price and lack of flavor, I will not return.",

My sister and her husband split the mussels and I had the beef tenderloins with the intention of bringing some home....nope!  I ate every last bit!  We finished with the warm bread pudding and it was to die for!  Fantastic food, wonderful service and a great experience.  I told my sister that was one of the best meals I have ever had!",

We were the last table seated before the restaurant closed to prep for dinner, and although we were the only patrons in there, she never made us feel rushed and the kitchen put just as much care into the food and presentation as I'm sure they do during \"normal\" hours. They nailed the burger - my husband was excited that he asked for it medium-rare and they actually made it medium-rare. The star of the show, as Hannah put it, was definitely the dark chocolate bread pudding - this is the dessert dreams are made of. Overall, it was just a wonderful experience. We're glad we got this taste of Phoenix!",

The hostess looked a little sideways when we didn't have a reservation (early on a Saturday night) but greeted us warmly and offered to \"squeeze\" us in.  We got it when we left and realized that the place was packed with lots of people waiting who probably all had reservations.   I had a very hard time choosing an entree because I wanted several of them.  I settled on the rack of lamb with spinach and goat cheese gnocci.  The lamb was encrusted with something and cooked to perfection as was the spinach.  My husband really enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli and my daughter devoured a flatbread pizza.  If you go, the berry empanada dessert  was amazing.  Next time we'll order two rather than one to share three ways.  The service was exceptional, the atmosphere inviting and cool without a hint of pretentiousness.   This is a great addition to the neighborhood.    We will be back.  PS... I commented that this was good for kids.  I should clarify that this was fine for my kid.  She's 11 and never has issues with fine dining or finding something she wants on the menu.  There were the flatbreads (like pizza) and a mac&cheese on the menu.",

Presentation was exquisite, attention to detail flawless and food scrumptious.  Our waiter Rex was a joy. He strongly recommended the chocolate bread pudding and it surely did not disappoint...a chocolate lovers nirvana. The restaurant is located in a shopping center and unassuming from the exterior but what awaits inside is True class. Very nicely appointed decor with an open kitchen. The four of us already have a reservation to return for a birthday celebration next week.",

So welcoming, beautiful, opened to the outside, ski lights, etc. who ever designed this place knew what they were doing. Neither of us were very hungry so we opted to split a crab and egg Benedict. I asked for the muffin to be replaced with spinach. It came with beautiful fingerling potatoes and was simply Devine.  The service, staff, entree, filtered watered, we were even asked if we wanted lemons. It was absolutely delightful. The Chef came out and thanked a party of 8 for coming out every Sunday. It has such a warm, and cheerful environment.",

    "text": "Even though I love the food here, I'm a little concerned that this place isn't going to make it.  The food is outstanding, but I think there is something wrong with management.  I was here on a recent Friday for happy hour, and while my bartender was attentive and very nice to me, he tossed a tip in another bartender's face (in front of customers) and called him some choice names.  It was awkward to say the least.  Also, even though the place was relatively empty (except for the bar area) my salad and other dishes took quite some time to come to the table.  My one other negative observation would be that management does not seem to be aware of what kind of alcohol they have available.  I was going to order a delicious cocktail that used Hendrick's gin (which nobody ever seems to have).  When I ordered the drink and complimented the bartender for their gin selection, the bartender looked really confused.  He told me they didn't have Hendrick's.  He wanted to sub it for Bombay, but Hendrick's is a unique Scottish gin, infused with rose and cucumber, so Bombay wouldn't have suited the cocktail.  He made me something else that was great, but when we were looking at the cocktail menu, we found another drink that required a brand of alcohol that they didn't have.  While all of these individual events aren't extremely unusual (coworkers fight, menus get screwed up), seeing them all in one visit is usually a sign that the manager isn't on top of it (especially allowing a bartender to have a dispute with a coworker in front of customers).  In any case, the back-of-the-house seems to have it together because the food is exceptional.  It's like eating comfort food, only better.  It's one of the few places I've eaten at that does grits well.  The roasted chicken salad with strawberries sounds really simple and it is, but it's extremely flavorful.  The sliders are great as well.  I've never had a bad dish here (the Kitchen Platter appetizer isn't bad, but it's definitely average--it's the only thing I would skip).  I think everything is priced as it should be, considering the quality and portions, EXCEPT for dessert.  The portions are pretty darn small considering the cost.  I would definitely visit them during happy hour and stay for dinner.  I hope they are able to overcome their staffing and menu hiccups so they can be around for a long time!  This neighborhood could use some quality restaurants that aren't chains.",

San Tan Hop Shock IPA was wonderful. We started dinner with a (shared) bowl of the soup of the day; a delicious squash soup with duck confit. Oh, yes. My pork osso bucco was fall-off-the-bone-tender, the pickled cabbage and asparagus spears were a great complement, and they let me sub in corn spaetzle for the standard garlic mashed potatoes. Wifey enjoyed her squash ravioli, and our 4 friends loved their scallop and steak dishes. Shared two small plate desserts - a chocolate creme brulee and berry empanadas. Really good. Service was friendly and attentive. A perfect evening.",

The last visit, we got the pork belly appetizer to share and me and the wife got the Beef tenderloin with white truffle mac n cheese and the Lamb Chops with lamb stew (yes!, two big lamb chops in a gravy with lamb stew meat) respectively, everything was just wonderfull. The meat was cooked perfectly, the stew sauce was amazing, and the mac n cheese is heavenly (probably my fav dish here, would eat it everyday if I could :-)). Some might say that the portions are a little small, I think they are perfect, fills you up perfectly without leaving you too stuffed & I find the prices amazing too for the quality & the presentation of food they serve. Yes we'll be back very soon!!",

    "text": "First time ever visiting this restaurant. We went based on word of mouth/Yelp reviews. We were excited to check it out. We showed up and sat at the bar for brunch. The bartender greeted us and asked for drink orders. We ordered a couple drinks. She made one and forgot the other for 15 minutes. Didn't remember until after I reminded her. She ran around frazzled, making drink orders, seeming flustered, empty drink dishes all around the bar. Didn't seem like she could handle much under pressure. Food came out and was mediocre. Small dish portions and not very satisfactory. Bartender never asked if we needed anything else. She then proceeded to \"check in\" a while later and said she would grab more water for us. That never happened, as again, she got overwhelmed by drink orders/other tables she was waiting on. We then wanted to check out, which took her another 10 minutes to get our check. She got caught up in being overwhelmed AGAIN. Honestly, I'm not one to complain, but this was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Either there needed to be better staffing, or a bartender that could juggle more balls in the air. They say you only get one first impression. Mine wasn't good and unfortunately I will not recommend this restaurant or be back.",

The kitchen board charcuterie plate is out of this world: their house-pickled veggies and homemade pesto are second to none.  Always keep an ear open for their specials! Burrata salad and asparagus soup are delish. Their cocktails tend to be on the sweeter side, but  creative and good. My hunny goes for the Fresno margarita and I've done various martinis. The steak medallions are so tender and have an incredible sear and the truffle mac is so rich. Have yet to try dessert as we've been too full but are eager to do so. The only complaint is that service does not match the food. Paige, our server tonight started our great (and was much better than the last--his name I don't recall) but after we had put our food order in she returned once, to ask us how our dinner was and deliver the bill. Food is spectacular, service needs some improvement.",

The hostess did good, the server did good and the food was 3.5-4 stars.  Salmon was good but didnt have the wild caught flavor of most salmon I've personally caught.  Maybe the salmon they serve is a different species.  No worries. Still very good.  I had the tenderloin speciality prepared very nicely over a grits and feta concoction.  Excellent flavors....just not super hot when it arrived at the table.  Over all setting is nice....nothing super wow in terms of romantic, but comfortable.  Yes, I would recommend for very good food at a very fair price.",

We had the salmon with blackberry glaze, the roasted natural chicken, the chocolate bread pudding and the creme brulee. The sides were delicious, especially the green chili mac and cheese.   We went on a Thursday night around dinnertime and didn't have to wait at all. When we were leaving it looked like there were quite a few people waiting for a table. It's worth it! The vibe is great, and dress can be casual or dressy. Everything is clean and all of the food tasted very fresh. A lot of people seemed to be ordering the fondue so it must be very good. Do not pass this place up!",

High quality ingredients prepared very nicely that accentuates the ingredients and does not take way from the ingredient. Menu has lots of options from a price point aspect which is nice.  Good wine list with many price points as well. Good happy hour too. Also did one of the wine dinners there and it was well done, perfectly paired wines with the courses.  We have experienced a bit of slow service a couple times, but we are not in a rush when I am having dinner. I would rather wait a few extra minutes to have a well prepared meal so we simply relax with our adult beverages. So unless your food took 2 hours to come out just relax and enjoy your dining companion(s)!",

The chef made a amazing meal the food was excellent. I had the beef medallions and my friend had the baked chicken and Rice. The portion were very small so I was still hungry when we were done.  Our service was slow took about 10m to get a glass of water and another five more minutes to get our beer & soda. She never did ask us if we wanted another drink. The check in offer was just for brunch :( so I didn't check in. The bar tender was awesome!! Made a few killer coffee martinis.. I took a picture of him so you be able to see who the excellent bartender was...  I will definitely return for the awesome great food and awesome drinks.. Nice place!   Side note.. The service was not terrible just compared to the chef and bartender service could use help.",

My husband and I tried a little of everything. The second time we tried different items and everything is just delicious and executed perfectly. Their mac n cheese with green chili is just amazing (under sides not starters!), the artisan cheese board is delightful, we had an amazing cauliflower soup (I believe they change due to seasonal vegetables). We don't live on the North side of town but my Mother does. This is our new go to stop in Phoenix. You've got to try it. Make a resie because it's small and always busy!",

It's 102 degrees outside and I am here with my girlfriends and my 2 month old sleeping baby and we want to order happy hour. Inside is an empty dining room and a table of two sitting at a 4 top. The only option for us was sitting outside because they refused to let us in the dining room if we wanted to order off happy hour. Their option was to split up our party, or sit outside with no misters or shade in the 100 degree heat. We asked to speak to the manager saying that it was too hot for a baby and they said we could leave or we could sit outside. It's really frustrating because my friends go here all the time and love it. Now we will never go back. It's ridiculous that they care so much about making money versus the health of a baby.",

A few of my favorites have been the grilled salmon, the beef tenderloin medallions, and the sea scallops. And try the white truffle scented mac-n-cheese!   For desert, the chocolate bread pudding is to-die-for.   Service has been consistently attentive and friendly. Great spot for a date night or a family meal. It's my parent's new favorite spot when they come into town.",

We had to wait for a table and we chose to do that wait outside and someone immediately came out to offer us ice water!! Highly recommend!",

The patio is kind of small, so tables are close together (making it more difficult to have private conversations and maneuver in and out of tables). Our waiter was friendly and knew the menu very well. For dinner, I ordered the grilled vegetable bread pudding, which had yams, squash, chef's whim veg, carrots, wilted spinach, and goat cheese. I enjoyed the dinner, although I thought it was pretty expensive for a veggie dish ($18). For dessert, I had an ice cream sampler that came with a choice of three house-made ice creams. I chose blackberry, vanilla, and strawberry chocolate chip. All three were delicious! Overall, it was a good dinner in a nice atmosphere. Just wish it had more beer choices (there were only four) and more options for vegetarians. I'm not a vegetarian, but someone in my party was. Since he didn't care for the only veggie dish (the bread pudding), he had to order a couple of side dishes.",

It's an unassuming spot in a strip mall but thank heavens it is an unassuming strip mall close to my house. This is my go-to spot. Honestly, there isn't anything that I don't like. The restaurant is well run. My table is ready when I get there. Service is friendly and attentive and smart - the servers know the menu and know the bar and are very willing to help me pair wines or select the best appetizer.  The food is beautiful. I don't just mean that it tastes good - it does. But they have a mis en place station where they dress each place and do QC before serving. It's fun to watch and they are attentive to detail.  I've had mussels and scallops many times and my husband usually goes for the osso bucco. Split a few things so that you can sample the menu and do ask for one of their signature cocktails. I'm a fan of their spicy margarita. So glad this place is in my path.",

We weren't even asked if we had a reservation ! When we asked to be seated for a meal, she told us that nothing was available. She then added that she may seat us at a large table, but if other people arrived, she'd have to seat them at the other end of our table.   As older People of Color, we recognized these young girls' racist, micro-aggression and decided to eat at the KOVO Modern Mediterranean restaurant, a few doors down, instead.  KOVO treated us as regular customers and their food was delicious.",

The restaurant wasn't busy when we arrived but it definitely picked up closer to the end of the Happy Hour time / beginning of dinner time.  We decided to try a few items out from their Happy Hour menu -- Goat Cheese & Grilled Peach Fondue, Short Rib Sliders, and the \"Kitchen Platter\". This was a lot of food for two people; we could've just ordered two items and been set!  The fondue was definitely our favorite, it had a unique taste with the goat cheese & sweetness from the grilled peach. My husband enjoyed the sliders, I'm not a huge fan of Short Rib so I didn't have more than a small bite. We did upgrade to the side of Truffle fries which we wouldn't do next time due to the price.  The \"Kitchen Platter\" was massive! It came with two different types of cheeses, three different types of meats, pickled carrots / cauliflower / sun-dried tomatoes, spiced olives, pesto, and bread. Overall, a really filling option with quality items. I wouldn't hesitate to get this again!  We ended up getting the Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding as well for dessert. It wasn't my favorite dessert ever due to the dark chocolate but it was pretty good. Their Brie Cheesecake sounded interesting so it's now on my list to try out next time!  Overall, a good choice of restaurant for Happy Hour! The service was good throughout the evening and they had decent sized menus for food and drinks. We'll stop by again!",

We've recently discovered that, since the minimum wage hike raising lunch prices all over, Rusconi's is barely more than the fast food/fast casual places for lunch (like the same cost as Panera Bread, less tip)...and the food and service are orders of magnitude better.  Try to sit in Norbert's section - he's a fantastic server and really elevates the dining experience.  I'll come back and review selected items later...working my way through the lunch options (but the daily specials are so good I'm not sure how long it will take to work through the standard items!)

    "text": "I've lived in the Phoenix area for 3 years now and I really should have written a review by now considering this is my favorite restaurant in the entire state of Arizona after 4 visits. This restaurant really is the total package - great atmosphere, great food, and great service. There hasn't been anything bad or mediocre that I've had here. The standout dishes, in my opinion, are 1) the scallops (who knew you could find scallops this fresh in such a landlocked city?) 2) braised beef ribs 3) green chile mac and cheese 4) pozole soup (offered during brunch only). You really can't go wrong with any of them. Unfortunately, I've never had the chance to take any photos from my first three visits as I eagerly devoured my food before the thought came to mind. On this last visit, the wife and I ordered the salmon and the monkfish special. The former comes with fingerling potatoes and brussel sprouts while the latter comes with green beans and a creamy risotto. As to which one was better, that's really personal preference. If you're more into a lighter whitefish, go with the monkfish. If you're more of a protein and potatoes kind of person, go with the salmon. We enjoyed both equally.   I also want to note that this place is a bit overlooked when it comes to brunch (understandably so since it is located next to a brunch place), but this really is a great option without having to wait for a table. Bottom line - it doesn't matter if you come here for brunch, lunch, or dinner. It's a great place and I definitely look forward to more future meals here.",

Our waiter Kevin was spot on with his service, promptness and recommendations.  We ordered an appetizer with shrimp and the cheese board that was excellent.  I ordered beef medallions with Mac and Cheese. The beef was superb but the Mac and Cheese was off the hook. My wife ordered Scallops and risotto. She loved it However the scallops were slightly overdone.  The watermelon gelato was to die for leaving us wanting more.  We can't wait to return.",

    "text": "This place is an absolute hidden gem. Who could imagine such a fabulous restaurant would be tucked away in a strip mall. Went with a group of friends for my birthday and we were delightfully surprised! Love everything about it, food, atmosphere, service. Superb. I had the roasted sea scallops with butternut squash puree, brussels, fennel apple salad and warm bacon dressing. And as an extra treat (it was my birthday afterall), I splurged with an addition of foie gras. To...Die...For. Well, I wouldn't kill myself if I couldn't eat it, but you know what I'm saying. Cooked perfectly, exquisitely delicious. As my sister so eloquently said, thank goodness mom taught us how to eat liver and onion as kids, cause now we can really appreciate the delicacy that is foie gras. Anyways, I digress. We also shared parmesan truffle french fries and the artichoke and goat cheese fondue with artisan bread toasts. (Clearly, we girls were NOT on diets and thank goodness!) They comped me the yummilicious chocolate bread pudding for dessert for my birthday. While amazing, my only constructive feedback would be that the dessert quantity was on the small side, well tiny actually. Enough for a taste, without feeling stuffed to the gills, but would have liked more than a taste. Our server Taylor was charming and flirtatious and he made our whole table feel special. There was zero pretentiousness about the place. I can say with confidence, you would never find a jewel like this in LA! Already recommended to half a dozen people! Make reservations, cause all my friends might beat you to the best tables.",

We also have stopped by for just drinks And desert and the bartender is excellent. Our favorite neighborhood place !",

The menu has options with great range and really leave you in a predicament.  We had the salmon and the lamb.  Lamb was really good, but the salmon is incredible. Wine list is fairly priced and has the half bottle option on some great Cabs.  Only recommendation (outside of location and sign), is a shake up of the starters menu.  Kudos and I hope you are here for a long time!",

Maybe we're spoiled by the bigger cheaper drinks and amazing food at places like Postino's and other North Central Phoenix restaurants.  We only wanted an app or two, but ordered three because I had that sense we would never make it here again, so thought we should try just one more thing.  The place is pretty.  And the base ingredients seem better and fresher than many other places around Tatum & Shea, but that's why we don't eat around here much. :(  Wish we had a reason to, would be so convenient with all the grocery shopping we do around this particular intersection.",

They make the ice cream in house, and it's all natural, amazing deliciousness.

It was a bit busy for a Tuesday night, but the wait was well worth it. My husband ordered the kitchen burger and was quite happy with his food as well. Ambience is very nice as well. I am definitely coming back again! They also have a good selection of food for the kids as well. It gets tiring just feeding your kid the usual, chicken fingers/hotdogs/quesadilla choices. Kids can choose short ribs, beef tenderloin, grilled salmon, mac n cheese, chicken fingers or mini burgers and fries. They do have a seasonal menu so not everything you see on yelp will always be available.",

The one reviewer that speaks about the food being sold out, does need to understand, this is a gourmet chef, using fresh products each day, and so this is not your standard fare, and when they are sold out, they really bend over backwards to accommodate you.  Chef Rusconi generally will come out to meet with the people. The first time I found this restaurant, it was because my friend told me she had found this wonderful restaurant I had to try.  What an understatement! We had the goat cheese and artichoke dip with soft pita bread, and braised ribs over a white truffle and mashed potato blend, with a golden brown gravy.  For dinner, one friend had the N.Y. Strip with the White truffle mac & cheese.  Another friend had the roasted Rack of Lamb.  I decided upon the scallops which were perfectly washed, not a bit of sand, and carmelized perfectly, plump and tender.  Not overcooked as so many restaurants do.  We have since gone many times, never disappointed.  You will not be either.",

    "text": "Tough review to write. I wanted to like it so badly, but in the end, it was just OK. We were passing through town and had just one dinner to spend in Phoenix, we read tons of reviews on Yelp and finally decided that for our one meal, we wanted Rusconi's. Unfortunately, we left feeling like we made the wrong choice.   First off, the ambiance of the place is awesome. Really cool decor and feel all around. After being seated we were informed that three dishes were sold out. Not a huge problem. I would always prefer that something fresh is out, than something frozen is always in. About 25 minutes later the waiter returns as informs us one of the entrees we chose is also gone, and we need to select a new one. This is one of the most frustrating experiences possible in a restaurant, especially so long after ordering. 10-15 minutes later our appetizer arrives. This may be personal preference, but 35-40 minutes is too long to wait for an appetizer, it felt VERY long.   For the app we had the Pork Belly and \"Sausage\" which included one tiny dime-sized  piece of sausage. It was delicious, and I wished there were more of it. The polenta, and apple relish were great as well. But the Pork Belly was just so so. I have had better many other places. It is slow roasted, so I expected it to be juicy and tender, but it was tough and seriously lacked flavor.   25 minutes later our mains were served. Again, I feel over an hour is simply too long. The timing of the whole meal was just off. For mains we had a Beef tenderloin (very delicious) with the white truffle mac & cheese (awesome) and the Pork Osso Bucco which was very average. It was super tender, but just no flavor. It was like it was cooked sans any seasoning whatsoever. The braised cabbage was the best thing on the plate.   In the end it was over $60 with tip (no drinks). It felt very overpriced for the experience we had. I can get much more, for much less elsewhere. We walked into Rusconi's wanting (and expecting) to be wowed. But in the end, we just left disappointed.",

But when you ask if the salmon is wild and the server says uhh, well it's sustainable.  Yeah. That means farmed. I don't care if it's from Scotland, it's farmed , and at this time of year get fresh northwest or Alaskan salmon from the pacific.  Wild. I get it at Fry's .  I would certainly recommend to others.  Not very busy but food  out quickly and hot.  Give it a try if you're in Scottsdale     I will be back for sure. Again staff was great and attentive.  If you want to walk out stuffed go to a dump like red lobster. Support local restaurants   My bro said his salad and scallops were great  so really I would make it a 4.5 if I could",

Although located in a basic strip mall, the restaurant is not a basic everyday chain like the retail stores and fast food restaurants that surround it.  The food is definitely the highlight. The service can be spotty and when busy they can get backed up in the kitchen. Servers however are generally very nice although not as proficient on the menu or wine selections as one would like.    Ah now for the food. Brunch is great! Wonderful variety of menu items, both sweet and savory.  Flavors are spot on and the prices are really good for entrees ranging from $ 9-15.   Love love the Posole Soup! And another favorite is the strawberry and mascarpone stuffed French toast.  Honestly, I have been to brunch 4 times and every selection was very good.  Dinner is also not to be missed. From the pork chop to the glazed blackberry salmon! Super yum!  Definitely pricier though.   Rusconi's is solid! No to be missed if your in our hood!",

The food was amazing, very fresh, great presentation, cool ambiance and great service. Also, very reasonably priced, I was pleasantly surprised considering it's a \"new American\" type of place. We found ourselves back for another little getaway, and even though we're staying 30 minutes from here we just had to come back. It was another great experience.",

    "text": "Visited this restaurant as a surprise reservation for our first Valentine's Day with my boyfriend, Ryan. We waited until 4 days before to book, so it is no surprise that the first available table was at 9:00 pm. Not a problem for us. Upon our arrival, the restaurant was booming with business and quite noisy, but that is to be expected. We were seated around the corner from the kitchen where a lot of employee traffic takes place and was even louder. This only bothered me slightly because the three tables next to us were empty when we arrived and remained so throughout our visit. Our server, however, was pleasant and prompt, although I don't recall her name (blonde, young, pretty).  Ryan requested the ancho chili seared ahi tuna w/ quinoa salad, avocado and tiny tomatoes for his first course, but they ran out. This was a bummer considering we had only six options to choose from. Instead, he ordered pan roasted key west shrimp w/ green chili grits, schreiner's linguica sausage, cured tomato and corn jus, which he enjoyed. I had boneless short ribs with kabocha squash, risotto, parmesan cheese and red wine jus...delicious!  Second course, Ryan ordered garlic and herb crusted rack of lamb w/ heirloom potatoes, small green beans, fennel, cured tomato and roasted pepper tapenade. I had herbed breast of natural chicken with preserved fruit, pearl pasta, small green beans and balsamic vinegar jus. Both meals were perfectly portioned and tasted excellent.  Dessert was included as part of the three course fixed menu. Ryan had grilled apple fritters w/ salted caramel and meyer lemon curd. Although they tasted good, these fritters strongly resembled cinnamon doughnut holes and couldn't have differed much. I had white chocolate cheesecake w/ blackberries, dark chocolate and berry sauces. This dessert wasn't impressive either as far as taste, but I love cheesecake and it looked beautiful.   I would litter any restaurant w/ five stars as long as I'm out with Ryan because he has me on cloud nine! This review was meant to be informative, we had a beautiful meal and I would really like to return.",

However it was their crab cake Benedict that simply blew us away. Blue crab and shrimp, fresh, light, and so delightful!

The piece I gave my daughter to try was, \" chewing on shoe leather\" . Overcooked Mac and cheese, pasta turns mushy. Disappointed , wish I had not been swayed into giving up my original destination.

It makes you crave a good meat dish from that second in. Smelt so good!  The restaurant looks like it would be small but it goes far back and is fairly big.   We started with the Parmesan truffle fries. To  die for. The flavors are perfect. And the dips are homemade and so unique. Loved it. A must-get if you go.   Then we had dinner. I had the chicken with green chile risotto and carrots. It has a limited availability so you want to get there early for dinner. The chicken was hot and melted in my mouth. The risotto was so good and I don't usually like green chile. And the carrots mmm! One of the best dishes I have had all year.   The ambiance was great. Dim lights. Slightly warm in there but it was a busy Friday night.   My boyfriend and I agreed it is in our top restaurants ever since moving to Arizona.   Loved it here. Absolutely no complaints. Can't wait to go back!!  Next time I want to try their brunch because we were told it was good.   Five stars. So fabulous.",

Even though some items on the menu rotate, I've tried almost everything. Hands down my favorite is the beef tenderloin medallions with truffle mac and cheese. Every time I order it I have the same magnificent experience. The beef is so tender and flavorful. And then pair it with the truffle Mac and cheese and you have magic in your mouth! (I'm currently drooling while thinking about it.) Other great items are the chicken and the lamb. But you honestly can't go wrong with the food. And don't forget to order the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. You won't regret it.   On of the best parts of Rusconi's is the staff. My family and I have been going there for some time, but we felt like family on our first visit. Fritz and Craig have quickly become like friends that invite you to sit at their own dinner table. And the rest of the staff are just as wonderful.   If you're looking for great food, great service, and a great atmosphere, this is the best place to go. And the best place to eat in The Phoenix metro.",

They split the salad for us and i can see they gave us bigger portion. The dressing was delicious and the salmon was melt in your mouth goodness. This salad alone was enough to fill us up, but we had the short rib melt to devour. The caramelized onions in this was so flavorful and they loaded up on short rib meat.

The staff at Rusconi's was very friendly, knowledgeable about their menu, and incredibly quick! It seemed as though every time we finished our place, the server would arrive asking if we were done. Talk about perfect timing. I wish I had discovered this place sooner! The food was truly delicious and the presentation of everything was absolutely beautiful. My mother and best friend who ate here with me today are already trying to pencil in brunch there this week due to how much we enjoyed our meal there today.  Thank you to the amazing kitchen and its chefs who made such exquisite food, including Evan! And Kevin our server was wonderful. Today may have been the first time I've been to Rusconi's, but it certainly won't be the last time! I know I'm a complete stranger but TRUST ME! Do yourself a favor and go to Rusconi's hungry!",

    "text": "Over probably thirty visits in four years, the Rusconi's staff have provided stellar food and service. The menu has core offerings but is constantly evolving through new food, new specials, seasonal selections and twists on established favorites. Maybe this time the burrata appetizer is set off with a tomato sorbet. Maybe now the posole surprises with a burst of juice from a pomegranate seed.  And, wait, is that chicken served with green chile risotto tonight? No matter the dish, the diner can expect it to be deftly seasoned, expertly cooked and invitingly plated. There have been so many standout dishes that I can't hold up just one as a favorite. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is warm and homey. It feels like being invited to eat with Rusconi in his kitchen. Time after time, the experience makes me want to come back for more.",

Our waiter Kevin was amazing with checking on us at the perfect time.  To start off with we ordered a Roasted Cauliflower Soup. It was a great portion size and there was no way I was going to finish that alone, my husband helped me eat it. It had hints of bacon and cashew in it which gave it quite the taste.  We both ordered Harris Ranch Kitchen Burger and it was very delicious, I really enjoyed the ketchup as it has a hint of sweetness to it. The fries were delicious and addicting as I couldn't stop eating them.  I really love the modern look the restaurant has and the ambience.",

I can't comment on a whole lot of things because every time I go, I order the same thing. Beef short rib sandwich. There are plenty of other things that look really good on the menu and I really should try them, but it's going to be tough. The short rib is perfectly seasoned and super tender, but not mushy. The horseradish adds a nice kick and the arugula balances out the sweetness of the crispy onions. One of my favorite sandwiches.  Service has always been good. Parking is easy as it's in a huge strip mall complex. Will be back for dinner sometime.",

My boyfriend ordered The Kitchen Benedict which was made with beef short ribs and had a pepper hollandaise that was to die for- I liked his dish more than mine, but he actually preferred mine. We also ordered the berry and marscapone stuffed French toast. I could've gone without the strawberries, as I don't love fruit on my breakfast, but it was super yummy! I can't wait to try their short rib melt sandwich- looks so bomb. It's tucked away in the shopping center behind Chop Shop, but you'll be glad you found it!",

Do not remember what I had the first time but the last time I was here I ordered the burger. It will not disappoint. Perfectly cooked perfectly seasoned with Crispy fries or choice of side. Staff is well-trained and attentive. Management is constantly roaming the restaurant to make sure everything's running smoothly. They even run food and clean up tables which I commend. One thing that bothers me tremendously is when management sits around and watches food get cold on the line or messy tables around the restaurant and just walk right by like it's not their job. That does not set a good example for your employees. Don't have to worry about that at this restaurant. Excellent selection of food drink in a casual atmosphere",

Walking in, we were greeted pleasantly by the staff and decided to wait at the bar until our table was ready. The bartender was excellent! He was friendly, knowledgeable and did an exceptional job of taking care of the regulars as well as the first timers like us.  Fritz was our server and he was as good as they come. Personable, professional and knowledgeable about their menu. Hubby ordered the steak special which was excellent! It was prepared perfectly and the accompaniments paired with it wonderfully. I typically do not order steaks, but that is one I would have been happy to finish off myself! I ordered the scallops and thanks to Fritz's suggestion, we finished our night with a chocolate bread pudding. I really drug my feet on that one, because I don't really enjoy bread pudding, but Fritz convinced me that I had to give it a chance. I had to admit that it was nothing like I expected and I would happily order it again.   All in all, we had a wonderful time and it was one of the best meals we've ever had! It is definitely a new favorite for us when vacationing in Scottsdale.",

My artist friend & I met for our quarterly lunch date = much talking for initial ten minutes without even reading the menu. Even though we were surrounded by a busy lunch crowd, we were tucked away at a nice quiet table on restaurant's perimeter. We were also surrounded by stunning paintings of cacti/flowers by local artist Dyanna Hesson. Our rock star server, Craig, checked in with us just enough, while we caught up, but didn't desert us either. Thanks Craig! For the main act, I ordered a luncheon staple, the salmon salad, starring a blackberry glazed piece of salmon. I wasn't sure of that flavor combo, but it's like a fancier, fruitier balsamic glaze. Salad wasn't ho hum ingredients but pizzazzed with crisply cooked green beans, scoops of quinoa, shallots, cucumbers w/ seeds cut out (amen), subtle sherry vinaigrette. My dining companion ordered the Rak Cuban Sandwich, a variation of the traditional Cuban. This sturdy sandwich was stacked with pork loin, jack cheese (instead of Swiss), clever addition of prosciutto for a twist, grain mustard, & pickles, on a ciabatta roll. She attested that 'wich was delectable -- flavors all meshing together like a symphony. For the finale, we opted for the mini lemon tart, artistically plated with berries/berry syrup, yummy lemon filling, in a buttery pastry, topped by a torched circle of meringue. The filling could have been a little tarter vs. sweeter, but that's a preference of mine with lemon desserts. So excited that I finally got to sample Rusconis & look forward to my next visit!",

Perhaps maybe add cranberry to it? Or something like a little spice? Just a thought. More importantly than that though, the duck was great and that is what matters.",

Food is terrific and the price is reasonable.  On my first night dining here, the waiter got my order wrong (salmon instead of lamb...he even brought out the steak knife to cut the lamb).  It wasn't a big deal, and I ate/enjoyed the salmon anyway.  Regardless, he comp'd me for the dish and also gave us dessert.  Class act.  That gesture also brought me back several times after that.  I would definitely recommend....I just wish they were in a better location.",

Doesn't matter if it was lunch or dinner.  The chef is always around and greeting his patrons.  Our waitress was great - attentive and sweet.  The only thing to note was that I spoke to an employee, whom I won't point out to get them in trouble since it's meant to be a constructive tip, is that don't fake wine knowledge.

    "text": "We've been to Rusconi's many times since they opened a few years ago.  Up until tonight we've been very pleased with every experience.  We had 7pm reservations and the restaurant was amazingly quiet for a Saturday night in Nov.  We found this unusual because even during the summer it's a busy establishment.  Eventually the restaurant filled up, but that was to their, and our, detriment.  The service (I'm not blaming the server, he's just the messenger) was very slow and spotty.  Dinner and drinks were served promptly, but that sharpness dropped off as quickly as our dinner was served.  Water glasses were left empty and when eventually refilled, were filled with warm water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for dessert, which never showed up, and eventually told them to forget the order and bring us our check.  If this wasn't bad enough, one of our guests never even had dinner because her entree (a chicken salad of all things) was so salty, it was inedible.  The waiter did put in another order for the same salad, but because everyone else was complaining about how salty their dinners were, our guest chose to cancel her dinner order and take a bite off her friends' plates.  We're not just talking a wee bit too salty, we're talking about a Morton's salt shaker being dumped on the entrees.  I am sure the restaurant will continue to pack them in during high season, and I hope they do because I like to see all local businesses succeed, but I do hope management reads this post so as to correct what's easily correctable in a nanosecond... quicker kitchen, improved service and PLEASE cut back on the overdose of salt you're dumping on everything you serve.  If people need to add salt to their food, they can do so at their own liking and pace.  Please take these suggestions to heart because prior to tonight's experience this was always a fabulous evening out.  For the near future our party will not be back anytime soon.",

The food is wonderful, the service attentive and the price points for such extraordinarily prepared and delicious food very reasonable.  The owner/chef and his wife show a great pride of ownership and the diner is the beneficiary of their endeavor.   Thanks to Nancy who took our reservation, we were seated at the community kitchen table which allows one to see the prep operation, line chef and waiters kitchen interaction-normally an operation that takes place behind closed doors.  This approach makes the staff much more in tune with the food and the patrons they serve.  Approachable, answering questions about ingredients etc., the proximity to the kitchen operation adds a new dimension to ones dining experience.  (The majority of tables are located away from the action if that's not your thing however.)   We love it and recommend trying it! The food... There were no misses!  Two of us had the set menu, four courses for $40.00 that offered all the most favorite dishes mentioned in the majority of the reviews here.  From the salmon to the macaroni-it was well worth it.  One had the pork tenderloin which was moist and flavorful.   I forgot to mention the fine martinis, try the pear martini!  Bookmark this restaurant, pay it a visit and enjoy a great evening.  Very nice and hardworking owners that deserve your patronage for delivering beautiful, flavorful food at a reasonable price.  Bravo!",

I ate the ginger and lemon pancakes and they were amazing. So much better than normal pancakes, the flavor was out of this world. It was served with hibiscus infused syrup and walnut flavored butter, both added great elements to a usually basic dish. It was very refreshing tasting. Others at the table had the short rib bendict and huevos rancheros. Both of them finished their plates and raved about it. The service was excellent as well. Wish this place was in Dallas!",

When we were seated, we did not see our waiter for about ten minutes even though the table beside was his also. He checked on them repeatedly and did not even acknowledge us. After he finally did come to the table, he seemed rushed and inattentive. We ordered the cold cut board and that came about twenty minutes later??? After an average glass of wine and no refills on our drinks, we decided to call it quits. Overall, bad experience, so so food, less than average service and we will not be going back.

I then had the salmon,  which was cooked to perfection at medium rare,  hard to do with a thick cut.   It was perfect.   My daughter and husband both had delicious burgers,  not my thing at a good restaurant,  but their Angus meat had great flavor.....And of course who could say anything bad about Truffle Fries!!!!   Other than I finished theirs and I shouldn't have,  but they were too good not to.

Once you step foot inside, you forget about the strip mall location, you are transported to a food delight universe. The hostess has the greatest smile to greet you, like she is happy to see you. Even though we had a reservation, and maybe because we were early, we decided to go to the bar and stayed there for dinner. Our experience started with the charcuterie and cheese board, and a half bottle of champagne. The recommended filet mignon entree and the lamb duo were to die for, and dessert was divine. The service was top, not intrusive, personable, friendly, knowledgeable. The wine list is ecclectic, something for everyone, and well priced. In short, Rusconi got 2 new fans that night. The GM stopped by, what a nice guy. Bravo Rusconi, and congratulations for the well deserved success.",

It was lunchtime and I was hungry, so I walked in and my life was forever changed:)  I enjoyed the Sirloin steak sandwich, which was the special that day (a Friday).  Fritz was my server (excellent server by the way) and I must say the entire experience was foodie Heaven!  Not only was the sandwich perfect, but I tried the chocolate bread pudding for dessert with a scoop of homemade butter pecan ice cream.  And people who know me know that I NEVER order dessert.  It was scrumdillyicious  My BF came up from Tucson the next day to visit and I took him there for dinner Saturday night.  We had the beef tenderloin medallions, salmon, kitchen board, and split the arugula/goat cheese salad.  He remarked that this was the most memorable dining experience he'd had since he visited San Diego several years ago and enjoyed a wonderful Italian restaurant there.  The food was glorious!  And again, the service was excellent--attentive without being intrusive.  I have been living in Phoenix since December and have tried MANY restaurants, Steak 44, Buck and Rider, Chelsea's Kitchen and many others--all of them really good, but Rusconi's is the standout and my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I plan to go there as often as I possibly can.",

After I walked through the door I ditched my first impression.   The restaurant was very busy but they quickly got us a table.  We were promptly and cheerfully greeted by our server Tommy.  He was a lot of fun and gave us some great suggestions that we took him up on.   We shared the Kitchen Burger and the Osso Bucco.  Neither disappointed.  The Kitchen Burger had a great fresh taste.  We ordered it with the fries and the lemon aioli that it came with was amazing.  The Osso Bucco was to die for and it was paired nicely with asparagus, whipped mashed potatoes and this delicious prickly pair cabbage.  Tommy checked on us several times throughout the meal and was extremely friendly each time.  Unfortunately, we were too full to try dessert but I plan on coming back for that because everything sounded amazing!",

All of the food looked incredible as it went by and it did not disappoint when we ordered! Two of my party got the steak (I forget which one) which came with the most delicious macaroni and cheese that I've probably ever had. My other friend got the salmon that she really enjoyed and I chose the pork osso bucco. I'm not really a pork person, but it looked SO good that I couldn't resist. Wow. Amazing. It fell right off the bone and was perfectly paired with the prickly pear cabbage. Needless to say, we did a good amount of eating off each other's plates and they were clean by the end of the night.  Dessert was pretty good. The panna cotta was light and refreshing and the empanadas hit our fried sweet spot. Service was excellent and the decor was beautiful. I can't wait to go back!!",

    "text": "I am reviewing this restaurant based on what it's aiming to be: a highish-end foodie destination.  I'm always nervous to try out new places at this price point, so whenever we are lucky enough to get a dinner out on our employers' dime, I get a little more willing to experiment outside my tried and True options.  Like many others that have reviewed this restaurant I was excited to have this addition to our neighborhood, however this place was a big disappointment.  Ambience and servers were nice, which is keeping this place from coming in at 2 stars.  Our waiter suggested a bottle of wine that I didn't like much at all, drinkable but not at all memorable.    We started with the charcuterie plate and the truffled mac & cheese (at our waiter's recommendation).  I get much better charcuterie at a place like Windsor and I found the mac & cheese to be plain gross.  In fact, I think most everyone at our table didn't like it as we didn't even finish the small little dish that was served (but as I said it was a business dinner so no one said much out loud).     The salad course was the best part of dinner- I thought my arugula, beets, goat cheese (ordinary) with fennel and mango (inventive!) was extremely tasty.  Others at the table appeared to like their salads as well.   I ordered the scallops at the server's recommendation.  The scallops themselves were the best thing on the plate (nicely cooked, perfectly salted), but nothing else on the plate was very good.  The spaetzle tasted like plain noodles, and there was some spicy red sauce drizzled around the plate that could have been Sriracha sauce (and yes, there is a time and place where Sriracha sauce is a delicious addition, but this was not it).  No one else at the table said much about their entrees positive or negative (which included Osso Bucco and the Buffalo).  Finally, desserts were boring.  Maybe we should have ordered the house made ice cream, but we opted for the bread pudding (which they were out of) and the creme brulee.  We got a pot of some other type of pudding/mousse instead.  They were fine.   Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was just disappointed all around.",

    "text": "I would love to give zero stars but unfortunately that's not an option. Honestly, the service was phenomenal! Both servers and bartender, hell..even the bussers were great. The chef however, Chef Rusconi, could learn some manners and to add, treat his staff and customers with more respect. I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions entree, cooked medium rare and the entree came out more than well done. Like seriously, if I wanted dry chicken then I would have ordered the chicken extra well done because that's what this (sad excuse for meat) tasted like. After sending it back and getting my \"new and improved steak\" the Chef himself pulls the employee aside and says \"the meat was cooked perfectly, if she would have just cut into the middle she'd realize that.\" I wish I could use a middle finger emoji in this review because I'm no idiot and I have ALOT of experience in the hospitality business. That steak was so over cooked, I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. As a \"chef\" you should take pride in your food, this is your product, this is your career...why are you standing in the expo line sending out obviously over cooked meat?! Tsk tsk Rusconi, your overcooked food is better than your egotistical attitude and self righteousness and that's not a compliment...  It's a shame to have such great employees yet you're the problem here.",

    "text": "We had lunch at Rusconi's a few weekends ago. My wife ordered the ancho roasted chicken sandwich, and after only a few bites, she noticed that the sticker from one of the avocados was actually in the sandwich. When we told the waiter, he had the manager come over to our table to explain the situation. The manager apologized and told us that \"obviously the sticker shouldn't have been in the sandwich\", which seemed a little insulting because we knew the sticker shouldn't have been on the sandwich. I was more surprised to see the sandwich still on the bill when it came time to pay. We didn't even get a discount on the bill, or a percentage off the next time we came in. There was a sticker in my wife's sandwich! I would think that warrants some sort of compensation. Obviously the manager didn't know how to correctly handle the situation, and needless to say, we won't be going back to Rusconi's. Very disappointing!",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends to check out their Happy Hour which runs from 4-6pm seven days a week. The HH food menu consists of  six items ranging from $1-$3 off the regular price menu.  Draft beers, wells, and house wines are all $1 (maybe $2) off. I am also supposed to mention, per my wine connoisseur friend, that the reds were served a little cold, but nothing body temperature couldn't handle.  Dave, the bartender and our server (there were only two other patrons at the bar), kept our alcoholic drinks flowing, but was a oblivious to the water refills, but hey, I understand the priorities...make that money.  Between the seven of us, we split one Kitchen Platter, Two orders of the Steamed Mussels, two orders of the Goat Cheese and Artichoke Fondue and two Pork Belly plates which satisfied any hunger, but didn't leave us feeling full.   -     The Kitchen Platter was what I was really excited for, but it ended up being pretty pathetic looking and I was relieved I was only paying HH prices for that puppy. Maybe serve it on a smaller platter next time for an optical illusion? Anyway, comes with chorizo (about 5 tiny pieces), artisan cheese (4 small slices), spiced olives, roasted peppers (which were like shoestrings that didn't even look like it totaled one quarter of a pepper), grilled artisan bread (4 slices), and a delicious pesto dip. It was good, but like I said, I wouldn't pay full price for that portion size. -     \"As far as Arizona mussels go, they are pretty good\" which accurately sums up that appetizer which comes with six mussels per order. -     The Goat Cheese Fondue was served in a cute mini staub pot and accompanied by warmed pita. The goat cheese was deliciously creamy (just as a note, the pieces of artichokes were few and far between so don't get this app solely for the 'chokes). -     The Pork Belly plate was by far my favorite dish I tried and I will recommend to anyone I know that is coming here. The combination of the pork with creamy grits and apple relish was amazing and if you don't like pork, just shove it to the side and it the grits with apple relish, seriously, very yummy. If you venture into Rusconi's you MUST try it out!  I rate it at 3.5 stars, but rounded up cause this place hasn't even been open for a week. I'm curious to try their dinner menu, which seems to be what the other reviewers are excited about.  I'm happy its in the neighborhood and I will be back to try more!  ----------- Visited a second time with a friend. I, again chose to sit in the bar area and the service was amazing! Zack made us feel like we were the only customers in there, despite the other patrons around. We started with the Pork Belly app ($6 HH price) and each had wine. I did notice the HH menu has changed, they now offer a burger for $9, the drink prices stayed the same.   For our entrees we went light by ordering salads. I had the Pulled Chicken and Strawberry Salad ($9) and my friend had the Romaine Salad. Both salads are on the smaller, starter portion side, but both were tasty. I loved the small little cubes of mozzarella cheese with mine. For two salads, two glasses of wine, and an appetizer we ran up a $42.00 bill. But we both were impressed with the food and service. Solid 4 stars this time :)",

Cooks top our list of favorite restaurants so we were excited to see what Chef Michael was offering in his own place.  My salmon was phenomenal and my husband's braised beef was tender and excellent.  Chef Michael even came out of the kitchen to talk to my four year old and find out what she wanted to eat, offering her whatever he could make.  In addition, when we asked if they had a piece of paper so she could draw, instead of bringing a blank piece of printer paper, they downloaded and printed a coloring page. It was so unexpected and thoughtful.  That is just an inkling of the level of service we received.  We will definitely be going back regularly.",

When alerted, the server did take the steak back to the kitchen, but returned with charred meat that was tasteless except for the burnt taste that the guests could not get out of their mouths. The server never once returned to check in after he brought the charred steak. Portion sizes were small for the price. When asked why the excessive fees for splitting, we were told it was because they add extra sides.  However, one of the meals was the risotto which did not come with a side and the second meal was the same as others in our party ordered and were exactly the same size. Would not recommend or return based on this visit.",

I had corn chowder to start, with the squash and goat cheese bread pudding for my entree, and the brie cheesecake for dessert. My husband had a salad starter, mussels (which he said reminded him of those he had in Paris), and chocolate bread pudding. I'm not normally that into cheesecake but was impressed with Rusconi's.   I asked about additional vegetarian options besides the savory bread pudding, and our server said I could do a variety of the side dishes. Based on the veggies that came with my entree, I think that would be a nice way to go, possibly with an additional starter. It was really hard to choose just one of those anyway!  Everything we ate was delicious, and the service was excellent. As a guest, I felt very well taken care of -- they even called the next morning to thank us for dining with them. Would love to go back!",

You don't expect much from the parking lot, with the restaurant lodged in between a Panda Express and an modest Italian joint, but it's delightful once you're inside. One in our party, an individual still depressed by having to return to Arizona after living in Manhattan, stated, \"It reminds me of a restaurant I would have gone to in New York City, but with cheaper prices.\"   Our favorite dish, odd given all the wonderful entrees we were served, was the White Truffle scented Mac N Cheese. Who knew? Searching to find something to critique, I might say it was a little loud inside, but the we were there on a Saturday night. Further, the front wall of the restaurant was open for patio seating, causing a bit of a draft on this cold night. Solved by a sweater. But those are small things. Rusconi's excelled in the big things: food and service.  Definitely make a reservation if you are planning on dining here during a busy time. With 300 yelp reviews averaging four and a half stars, this gem is no longer hidden.",

    "text": "Visiting Phoenix on business, I had a few hours before my flight home and wanted to find a great place for lunch. After reading the reviews on Yelp and TA, Rosconi's, it was!   Rosconi's did NOT disappoint! First, it can never be understated just how much good customer service impacts your dining experience. The hostess was pleasant when she greeted me and my server was nothing short of fantastic. She knew how to read her tables and provided just the right amount of attention to each. I never had my iced tea empty nor did I have to respond to incessant \"how is everything\" with a mouth full of delicious food. She was amazing.  Now let's discuss the menu. There were so many delectable items, it was quite a task to decide. I opted for the White Truffle Mac N Cheese as an appetizer and the Blackberry Glazed Salmon for my entree. The presentation of the Mac N Cheese was just adorable, but that was nothing compared to the wonderful moment I ate my first bite. Truly delicious beyond words. I can still taste it and this was two days ago. The Salmon was cooked perfectly at medium and blackberry glaze was an unexpected delight.   I ended the meal with the Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding coupled with a cappuccino. The moist dark chocolate bread pudding was perfectly topped with white chocolate chunks and was surrounded in a white chocolate sauce. I can honestly say that this will go down as one of my absolutely favorite desserts.  All in all, I will always make sure to visit Rosconi's when traveling to Az. Truth be told, I may travel to Phoenix just to eat here!!!",

I know I had scanned the description of the menu item.  I hadn't seen anything about goat cheese.   I was thinking about sending it back cause I CAN'T stand goat cheese!!   I gingerly took a few more bites.   I didn't taste it anymore, thank goodness.  It had a tiny bit of shredded roasted chicken.  Tasted like the roast chicken we pick up in the local grocery store.   The dish had a somewhat creamy sauce.  I don't know.   I didn't find anything about it that was especially exciting, but to top it off, afterwards I had stomach cramps, something I get when I eat food that has bacteria.  Was the chicken left out too long?  Was something old in the dish?   Would I go back?   I very strongly doubt it.",

The place isn't huge so I would recommend making a reservation, but if you are an early bird like my wife and I, it won't be a problem getting a table.  Service is generally pretty good even though we lost our waitress a few times during our last visit.  The only other thing that pissed me off was that they charged for blue cheese olives for my martini.  They were 75 cents each which isn't a big deal.  The big deal was that they charged at all.

Craig had the most genuine, exceptional customer service and made the whole evening special for my mom and our whole party. The food was fantastic as well but Craig made the night memorable.

Very knowledgeable waiter who suggested drink pairings and offered suggestions from the daily specials as well as the seasonal menu. Everything ordered turned out great, boneless short ribs, are a starter worth ordering again. Entrees were reasonable in size though there were no left overs to box for a future meal. I had the pork osso bucco, which turned out great, and while I'm not generally a big fan of some vegetables I had no trouble cleaning my plate as they were all seasoned in delicious ways.

Great personality, friendly, helpful and on top of everything!    I ordered the tenderloin medallions with truffle Mac n cheese and carrots/green beans.  Melt in your mouth good!  Even though I was full after half I finished it off because it was so yummy I didn't want to waste it.  My daughter got the cheeseburger and mashed potatoes and those were very good as well.  Had the chocolate bread pudding and some Italian custard thing for dessert.  Everything was freaking phenomenal!  Seriously.... Sooo good!    The drinks were interesting... The pear martini was very good but there was a special martini that Bobby made us.  It had Red Stag, pineapple juice, grenadine and smoke.  I've never had a smoke drink before but it was such a cool touch plus it tasted amazing!    Wish I lived closer but I will definitely make the trip up to Scottsdale occasionally for this treat!",

But my wife and I were looking for something new to try, so we stopped in for dinner.  We noticed it was very busy on a random Tuesday evening - probably a good sign.  We also noticed everybody was genuinely friendly inside: the host, our waiter, the manager.... The decor was nice too.  And the food was outstanding.  I started with the butternut squash soup, which I usually am not a fan of but the server really sold it on us.  I was not disappointed at all - it was delicious.  Garnished with duck ravioli and full of flavor.  For my entree I had the scallops.  Again, lots of flavor, served over mashed potatoes and topped with fresh sprouts.  Delicious, and not overly filling either.  My wife really enjoyed her natural roasted chicken and wine.  With our entrees being so good, we took home some bread pudding for dessert.    Overall, very pleasantly surprised.  We'd intended to grab a quick bite, but this turned into an outstanding meal.  We will definitely return.  (And it takes a lot for me to give five stars!)....",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp once again. You came thru in recommending a wonderful place. Atmosphere was great and the food was wonderful. I had the steak medallions. Presentation and portion size was perfect. They obviously have wonderful chefs that know how to not only prepare but also combine other foods to make it fantastic.  The only downside was the serving staff. Most were rather young and dressed rather casually for food that looked & tasted more higher end. Our server was a rather young man and his inexperience showed. He was more concerned with his coolness then our table. He was quick to take our order and quick to get his tip but that was about it. Once we received our food we never really saw him again. Would appreciate a more professional/mature staff but would definitely recommend the food and atmosphere to anyone in the area.",

I was visiting relatives in Anthem and we took the 30 minute drive through Phoenix to enjoy truly the best meal I have ever had.  I cannot adequately give credit to the grilled beef tenderloin medallions over truffle scented mac-n-cheese.  The experience was heavenly.  By comparison, my former favorite meal was pan seared salmon at the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore.  Rusconi's edged ahead of the Four Seasons!  This was an event!  In addition to a welcoming atmosphere and the excellent assistance of server Rex, the entire ambiance was terrific.  And here's another side bonus - the tables are not jammed together so I didn't have someone next to me breathing on my entree!  Major kudos to Michael Rusconi and his team for an amazing experience.  Thank you!  P.S. My sister had the scallops -- her response: \"The best scallops I've ever had\".",

    "text": "It's difficult to find an American restaurant anymore where you are expected to trust the chef.  It's usually pick an entree and pick a side.  Rusconi's is one of those establishments where the chef does not just craft each dish; Rusconi actually pairs the entree with the sides.  This is refreshing.  Take, for example, the first meal I had there: the pork osso buco.  It is served with prickly pear-braised red cabbage, grilled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  If you don't like those sides, you don't deserve to eat the pork osso buco.  That's really all there is to it.  That may sound harsh, but that is how art should be. (To be fair, I don't know if Rusconi does substitutions.  I was never churlish enough to ask.)  I have also had the Durham Ranch Buffalo Sirloin and the Rack of Lamb.  Both were cooked perfectly.  One thing I should note about this place is it's not for the person who wants to leave stuffed.  The portions are not huge, but they are satisfying.  This is how restaurants should be; overeating is one of the biggest public health issues we face as a society.  Thank you Chef Rusconi for doing your part to fix this.  I love that I can still go for a run after eating dinner here.",

    "text": "Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.  Rusconi's didn't.  THE GIST: Modern American menu / Inconsistent seasoning / Service needs work  FOOD HIGHLIGHTS  Goat Cheese Fondue with Pita Bread: The fondue was good, the pita bread used to dip it was not.  Our first batch had lukewarm pita bread that had a chewy, dare-I-say microwaved consistency.  After our table finished the first round of pita bread, they were kind enough to offer a second; this batch came out burnt, but this time with a sitting-on-the-counter-too-long consistency.  Cheeseburger with Fries: Several members of my party ordered this one, one of them asking for no salt on the fries.  Everybody else got crunchy, but very salty fries.  Her order seemed to have a batch of unsalted fries sitting atop a batch of salted fries, because there was definitely salt at the bottom of her bowl.  The burger itself was unremarkable.  Ossobuco: This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly under-seasoned and rather dry.  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but dry ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.  Not recommended.  CONCLUSION  It's trendy, it's big, and it's American, but there are too many places pulling this concept off correctly for me to recommend this to anyone.",

Had to be sitting in dressing for a while. The salmon piece on my plate was so ridiculously small it was offensive that they sent that out. I have NEVER had a portion so small. Spoke with the manager, who was very nice but, he defended their lunch portion size and said I should order the dinner portion next time. Really?  How about you just serve a decent cut of salmon! First of all, I weigh 120 lbs, so I don't eat very much to begin with. I've never gone for lunch and had a protein on my salad that I had to make a comment about.  I would never go back.  With all of the great restaurants in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area I wouldn't waste my time or money there again.   If you need to charge more for a larger portion just do it, but don't skimp on what you're serving your customers. Between the salad itself being limp from sitting in salad dressing and the portion of the salmon, that did it for me.",

Rusconi's is nestled between a Panda Express & My Big Fat Greek. With the lack of street visibility, you just might just overlook this gem - look for the huge wooden entry door (which almost gives the appearance that the place is boarded up if you are just driving by).  One step inside, and you know right away that this is no ordinary strip mall eatery. Very inviting decor, and beautifully decorated with and upscale feel, but not pretentious.   We didn't have a reservation - this was a weeknight and the place was busy! A couple of seats opened up at the bar so we opted for them instead of waiting. The bartenders greeted us right away and introduced themselves (Dave, Zack and \"the new guy\")  and started us off with our adult libations.   We skipped the starters and dove right into the entrees: Roasted Natural Chicken and Grilled Salmon. The salmon, with a wonderful blackberry glaze, was grilled to perfection. And delicious, too! When the chicken dish was delivered, I was told that the plate was very hot. And it was - at least half of it. And the food itself was lukewarm - tasty, but disappointing. I mentioned this fact and my dish was whisked away to be made right. When the next one was delivered, it was piping hot...and oh, so good! Chef Michael Rusconi's green chili mac 'n cheese is wonderful! The chili does not overpower the dish so you get a wonderful layering of flavors. The chicken was very moist and super-flavorful.  This is going to be one of our \"go-to\" places! Great ambience, delicious food, reasonable prices - what more can you ask for?",

    "text": "It's not often that I'm the last of my family to try a culinary establishment in the valley, but tonight was just such an occurrence.  I've dined a number of times at Lon's at the Hermosa, where Chef Rusconi first earned critical acclaim.  But until tonight I had not tried his new place, which has apparently garnered its own legion of fans (if Yelp is any indication).  My Mom had been here a number of times and is a passionately devoted fan of the restaurant.  So we decided to dine together so she could show me what I've been missing.  The restaurant is tucked in amidst a huge shopping center on Tatum & Shea, just a stones throw from Paradise Valley Mall.  When you walk in, you're immediately greeted with an atmosphere and a look of a restaurant that is refined, but also casual.  There's a nice bar as well as some patio seating up front.  Towards the back you walk past a nice fireplace and a decent assortment of wines on the wall.  We got a reservation for two, but there was plenty of seating on Sunday that we really didn't need it.  Almost as if psychic, our host knew my Mom easily gets cold and sat us next to the fireplace.  The menu changes with whats in season as Chef Rusconi apparently makes a point of it to source as much of his ingredients locally as possible.  Prior to arriving, I had my heart set on one dish in particular.  The beef tenderloin medallions with mac & cheese.  But before I could order, the waiter reminded me that night was beef short rib night.  Suddenly the gameplan changed.  I got the beef short rib with spaetzle, carrots, and green beans dressed in an au jus.  For an appetizer beforehand I got their white truffle mac n cheese so I could get my mac n cheese fix.    The mac n cheese was served hot in a little pot and was delicious.  Super creamy, noodles were cooked perfectly, and the portion was perfect for sharing.  The short ribs were also good, though I wouldn't say its the best short rib I've had.  It was a little tougher and not as tender as short ribs I've had at places like Beckett's Table and Crudo.  It was still tasty, but I probably should've gone with the tenderloin this time around. My Mom got the Scottish Salmon with a blackberry glaze, potatoes and veggies.  She loved this dish, particularly the glaze.  For dessert, my Mom and I split a pair of dishes.  A dark chocolate creme brulee, and a brie cheesecake with fruit compote.  These were both a home run.  I'm not a dark chocolate guy generally, but this creme brulee was fantastic.  Great texture, the chocolate was super creamy and rich.  The brie cheesecake was also outstanding with a great contrast of sweetness with the fruit and the savory of the brie and a soft crust to boot.  Total pricing for the appetizer, two main courses, two desserts, two glasses of wine, tax, and tip was $135.  My Mom actually had a Rusconi's gift card and I had an Open Table Dining Cheque (which they do honor) so that discounted our meal a bunch.  Overall I was pretty impressed with the place and the food was also pretty impressive.  It wasn't perfect nor did it have an OMG factor in my opinion, but I would absolutely come back for another bite.  And the ambience is great for dates, small groups, or whatever the occasion.  I mean, its Mom approved, so its gotta be good, right?",

But, and this is enough to make us decide to go elsewhere when discussing options, the waitstaff are simply overbearing and cloying and intrusive.  I am annoyed when waiters ask how \"we\" are doing. It's just irritating. They are not dining with us. They are waIting on us. .  Rusconi's have obviously trained their waiters to do this, and sometimes several times during the course of a visit.  If the restaurant is good, the delivery of the food, correctly prepared and placed in front of the person who ordered it, is more than sufficient.  Keeping an eye open on the tables to see if diners are looking for attention is also good.  Interrupting a meal and conversation with a sickly sweet request for affirmation is simply wrong.  I hope the chef/owner reads this and does something about it. I'd really like to go back again.",

With fantastic service and a wine list I definitely want to go back and explore further, this counts as one of the best dining experiences I've had to date. The menu is gorgeous, and I wish I could have tried everything.  Nothing improves a bad day like stick-to-your-ribs New American food, fresh and warm from the kitchen. I'm definitely going back here.  Edit: Figured I'd elaborate more now that I've been there more than once.  Me and the fiancee decided to get dressed up all fancy and go out on the town for Valentine's Day. First stop? Here, for a $50 prixe fixe 3-course meal. Let's just say it was the most I've ever committed to spend on food without even knowing the menu, so I was worried that I would regret it.  Oh heck no. I did not regret it. They made it a Valentine's Day to remember!  My pork tenderloin was creamier than the freshest buttermilk, her steak perfectly cooked exactly to order (medium rare, of course, we're not heathens). The risotto was so decadent that I felt like I was committing a cardinal sin every time I took a bite. But it all paled in comparison to the dessert: this custard passionfruit thing served in a mason jar that was pretty much the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. I could write an ode to that dessert. For a second, even my breathtakingly lovely fiancee paled in comparison to the beauty of it.  If I lived closer and could dedicate more money to our eating out budget, I'd be here every single day, eating the delicious food for the rest of my life, and never get sick of it. Chef Rusconi is more than just some chef or a cook, he's really an artist. This is the kind of food I expect to pay an arm and a leg for. If this place was a museum, it would be the MET. Nothing here is short of a work of art.  I'm a bit obsessed with this place. But hey, it can be hard to please my little foodie heart, and this place definitely makes the cut.",

    "text": "My review is directed towards the restaurant owner.  I recommend that you speak with your wait staff and ESPECIALLY your general manager, Tom Brewer, in regards to what excellent customer service should look like.  I guarantee you will lose customers if you can't provide the level of service that people expect when they walk through the door.  I understand people get stressed when it's busy but that's part of working in a restaurant. I personally felt like my server couldn't care less about my dining experience. He also couldn't tell me what the cheeses were on the cheese board and the kitchen board. When I asked him he simply said \"I'm not sure\". I had to ask him to go and check, Our food was just just ok. I think by the time we got it we were so turned off by the service that we were already wishing we had picked a different place. So many places now have this type of food on their menu and provide much much better service.  I had the scallops which were great quality but unfortunately WAY over seasoned and much too salty.  You should let the scallop be the star of the show, not the salt and seasoning.  The goat cheese grits that the pork belly appetizer came on were some of the best I've had and I don't even like goat cheese.  The bread on our cheese board was meant to be toasted but was just thrown over an open flame so was burnt.  The brie cheesecake was a huge disappointment.  The best part about it is the crust which is absolutely amazing.  However, it's served crust side up which is pretty to look at but hard to eat.  We wound up flipping ours over.  I should mention this was my second time there, the night before I had come for happy hour.  I received the same lackluster service and my chocolate martini was probably the worst I've ever had.  It was WAY too strong, no chocolate flavor to speak of except the Hershey's syrup on the inside of the glass.  Now typically I'm very happy to get a drink that's on the \"stronger\" side, but this was too much.  After a couple of sips my tongue was numb and honestly it was just really hard to get down.  If I wanted pure vodka I would have ordered a vodka on the rocks.  It also had three coffee beans floating in it which again, was pretty but not well thought out since in order to drink it I had to either remove the beans or make sure I didn't swallow them.  My happy hour experience was my first time there and thought maybe the bad service was a fluke so that's why I came back the second night for dinner.  I always like to give places at least two chances.  Not to mentioned I had seen the review of your place on Check Please and was so excited to try it.     As for your general manager Tom, he is the main reason why I will not be returning.  He did not introduce himself as the general manager, just approached me by tapping me on the shoulder and told me that you guys could no longer hold my reservation and I would not be able to dine there that evening. (my dining partner was running 45 minutes behind which I understand can present a problem, but there are ways of dealing with things that don't involve being rude)  I didn't even realize who he was and had to ask \"who are you?\"  He quickly snapped back \"I'm the general manager\".  Here's the deal.. if you're the general manager then dress better than jeans and a sweater.  Also, here's a thought.. how about you be professional and put a name tag on.  Especially if you plan on walking up to people randomly and ordering them to leave.  Imagine my surprise!  I practically had to beg him to \"let\" us eat at the bar and once my date arrived there was a free table anyway so there was no need for him to even approach me in the first place.  What he should have done was come up to me 15 or 20 minutes after my reservation and ask me when my party would arrive and then from there offer solutions or options for me.  But instead he decided to catch me off guard and basically tell me to leave.  He was very rude and treated me like I didn't matter. As if my business was not important to him or your establishment.  I honestly have never been approached like that and at first I thought he was joking, trying to give me a hard time.  I even said to him \"oooh you're joking\" and began laughing.  He kept his stressed out and serious face and said \"no, I'm not.. I'm being very serious\".  It was literally unbelievable the way he spoke to me and how he handled the situation.  The only reason why I stayed is because I was meeting someone for a first date.    I really hope you will take this review into consideration, I think this place has potential but the poor attitude of the staff is holding it back in my opinion.  I won't be dining here again and have already begun spreading the word about the less than satisfactory experience I had here.",

Potatoes weren't great, but weren't bad either. - shrimp and grits, the grits and sauce were delicious. The shrimp tasted a little muddy, but that's coming from someone who lives on the ocean and has fresh seafood all the time. 4/5 - artichoke fondue, this was actually quite disappointing. It's an artichoke dip, not a fondue, it was served lukewarm Not worth the money. 2/5 - Girl Scout dessert, maybe the best dessert I have ever had(just my opinion). It is like taking a peanut butter and banana sandwich and making it into a caramel flavored sundae. My wife didn't think it was as good as I did, but I thought it was superb! 5/5",

The food at the restaurant was very good and the waiter was very attentive.   The restaurant had a nice ambience.  However, what ruined our evening was the bartender.   We arrived a few minutes early and we were forced to sit at the bar and wait.   From the moment we sat at the bar, we just wanted to be moved to a dining table.   The bartender was grumpy, confrontational and had a flat affect on his face.   A couple of ladies sitting at the bar were shaking their heads at his less than pleasant behavior and aura.   Finally, we had a table open to be seated but he demands us to pay for the beer we were drinking before moving on to the table.  I asked if we could pay for the beer at the end of the dinner and he was very grumpy and confrontational about transferring the bill.   The rest of the evening was fine except that the tables were too small and close to each other that the waiter serving the next table bumped into me a few times.   Again, the food was very good with excellent presentation.   However, fine dining is not just about food and ambience.   Its also about having an overall pleasant experience.

We arrived at 5:30 and, thankfully, we had made a reservation, because even on a Monday night, it was very busy. The server was excellent, pacing the meal perfectly and keeping everyone supplied with beverages.  We sampled many dishes, from the shrimp and grits appetizer (savored every bite) to the arugula and blue cheese salad (divine) to the burger (huge and juicy) to the bread pudding (pronounced \"Perfect!) No one had anything but positive things to say about every dish. And there were so many we didn't try, I can't wait to go back. We were there to catch up as well as eat, but never did we feel rushed even though the restaurant was busy.",

We were seated right away with no reservation but I strongly recommend making one so you are not disappointed. It was a beautiful night out so we dined out the small patio. Previously we have dined inside which was warm, cozy, and comfortable. The service tonight fantastic as in previous visits. Our server was attentive without hovering and charming.   We started our meal by sharing the boneless short rib with a chocolate chili sauce. The meat was tender and the flavor was delicious. I had the beef tenderloins with a side of truffle Mac and cheese. The beef was perfect but I would have been just as happy with a bowl of that delicious macaroni and cheese! My mom ordered the scallops which she said melted like butter in her mouth. For dessert we shared the Brie cheesecake with fresh berries.",

This is the first place that I have been to in Arizona that can actually make decent mussels and these weren't just decent - they were awesome! For the entrees we tried the lamb and the scallops. Both were great. The only comment I can make is that the lamb was out of this world, but the scallops were just \"solid.\" Also, the cream of mushroom soup was pretty bland so that is the only thing I would recommend skipping.

    "text": "This is another place that I'm kicking myself for not trying sooner.  I think I need to start a \"Thanks to Lisa E.\" list because here's another spot that I discovered because of her. Truth be told, Rusconi's has been on my bookmark list for a while, but Lisa expedited my introduction to this awesome place.  True, it's in a strip mall but they've done a fantastic job with the space and the result is a classy/cozy spot to eat.  Their menu is a farm to table concept with creative entrees using fresh ingredients. They have a small bar which is a fun place to position yourself. They have a good wine selection and the friendly bartenders whip up some tasty hand-crafted cocktails.  I had the roasted sea scallops which were good sized, and served with baby cabbage in a delicious glaze.  They have some other amazing entrees....the tenderloin is on my \"to try\" list for next time. And though I don't eat lamb, I have to admit that their lamb dishes sound intriguing and delicious.  This is really a great spot for a date, or a group or family meal. HIGHLY recommend!",

Lots of classic dishes mixed in with some less common choices. The dishes are obviously well planned and executed perfectly.   We started with a bottle of red wine and the goat cheese fondu. Creamy and spicy. Just the right amount as not to get over cheesed.   Next, I had the beat salad. A little smaller than I like and the beats were not the star of the dish but overall, pretty tasty.  For my entree I had the buffalo sirloin. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with a delicious savory bread pudding. Great dish. I highly recommend. I had bites from around the table including the mussels, the chicken and the Mac and cheese that came with the tenderloin medallions (really tasty).  Overall, loved Rusconi's. Get pasted the fact that it's in a strip mall next to Panda Express and you won't be disappointed.",

They were some of the best I've ever had. My hubby had the steak medallions with the truffle Mac and cheese. Tyler said it was life changing, and he was right..it was so good. Most of us got a salad to start. They were soooooo yummy. I do t like when they put too much dressing on. They put the right amount so you had some dressing, but the veggies still had their taste. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal, with a wonderful staff and atmosphere. I can't wait to go back for brunch or lunch. Give this place a try...you won't regret it.",

There were only a half dozen of us seated, yet we could not get our bartender to make eye contact when we were ready for our bill, even when out of desperation I finally went and stood in front of him and the register hoping to pay our bill.   I  asked for the hostess to see if we could pay our bill with someone else, and no we couldn't.  Finally, I just estimated what the bill was and left cash; something I felt awkward doing but there seemed to be no other choice.  And I blame myself, because it had been a while since I have been there and I had forgotten that the happy hour bartender is just consistently this way.  (No issues with the lunch bartender/waiter.)

And on Sunday's they offer $4 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas...How can you go wrong?? My only pointers would be that the hostess could use some engagement training AND I would make sure to have that fireplace fired up and toasty BEFORE you open on these chilly wintery mornings!! But... Just a great little place with an excellent flavorful menu!! And a handsome host to boot!! We'll go back and often!!",

I really wanted to like this place, but it was a literal disappointment.  The place was beyond noisy and we could not hear ourselves speaking.  The seating is crammed it like sardines especially if you sit on the half booth like seats.  Since it took the wait staff over 40 minutes to bring out bread I expected it to smell yummy and be at least hot and taste amazing, nope not even real butter, hard crust, cold store bought bread.  Then the real problems came along.  It took over one hour for us to receive our salads after we placed orders.  2 1/2 hrs for a dinner service sitting on very uncomfortable seats, wow very long.  The food was just ok nothing to write home about it was actually rather boring and very small amount,  We went in hungry and came out hungry.  Not much food very overpriced and nothing was really good but more on the boring side.  Taylor the waiter was great and very attentive.  Maybe they were having a bad night.   Another thing I do not like is when someone touches my food.  If I worked for the health department, this restaurant would get a C if best because the owner who stands at the kitchen and previews each plate which comes out touches the food with his bare hands, he does not wear gloves when he puts your toppings on your salad and does not use a spoon, he uses his bare hands and it is disgusting and unsafe.  He wipes his hands on a blue towel which is also used to clean the plates and re uses the towel over and over again.  It is not very sanitary.  The bread was terrible, the garlic risotto was pretty good a little on the salty side, the asparagus was okay along with the truffle mac and cheese ok.  Like I said nothing to write home about, nothing tickled my taste buds and it was basically a very boring meal or rather half a meal not much on the plate.  Came Hungry Left Hungry no wow factor but all the plates looked really nice.  We will not be back.  -   The next day, The owner Michael Rusconi called us probably trying to find the person who wrote the review. boy very very rude.  Be very careful about dining here especially if the owner can not take diners reviews.   He did not even apologize for touching people's food which is a no no in the restaurant business.  I wanted something which tasted amazing and wowed my taste buds, not sure why this was do hard for him to understand.  Owner is Very Very Rude.  Be careful!!!!",

The food was good so I might be convinced to go back for dinner.   +1 for keeping our water glasses full +1 for taste +1 good happy hour -2 for snotsdale attitude",

    "text": "This was our second visit to Rusconi's and we are still just as impressed. My Fiance once again had the scallops, totally enjoyed them...again, served over pureed cauliflower, which I could have sworn was whipped potatoes, yummy and healthy.  This visit I had The Tenderloin Medallions, you could practically cut them with a fork. Served over Rusconi's Mac-n-cheese with truffle oil. Also, grilled Asparagus and carrots. The veggies were done perfectly and if you are looking for a quick snack, grab the appetizer size of Mac-n-cheese, super great! It definitely is not velveeta!   Definitely make reservations. This is a bustling, busy place.",

I have enjoyed many many items off the list. Free range chicken, medallions, over (10) wine dinner pairings and just a glass of wine. And that is where I am right now. No food. Just some wine. Enjoying a great glass of Cuvaison Chardonnay from Carneros... 2013 winery of the year... Try a glass won't you!!!",

It was accompany with perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes and fresh Brussels Sprouts. I definitely would go back to try their other fine dishes.",
