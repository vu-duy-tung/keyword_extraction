Outstanding entrees - for the record, pineapple/chicken curry, pad thai, cashew chicken (#7), basil chicken (#8) - all were delicious. Portion size more than adequate. Our experience caused me yet again to reflect on the term 'crapulent' - that is, the state of feeling uncomfortably bloated as a consequence of overindulgence in the pleasures of the table. It's one of those places where it's difficult to stop eating, even when you know you've had more than enough, 'cause it just tastes so darned good. Some of the best Thai cuisine I've run across in the Phoenix market, I think :-)  .",

We were greeted and seated almost immediately. After perusing the menu we ordered a Spring Roll appetizer, Pad Thai for my wife and Green Curry (med heat) for myself. Everything was delicious and the heat level on my curry was spot on. Hot would have a bit too much (for me) and Thai Hot would have been out of the question. Our waitress answered all of our questions and the service was very good with frequent visits for water and tea refills.",

    "text": "Mediocre entrees and possibly the worst example of a Thai appetizer I've had in America. Having grown up in thailand I can be a bit picky but the yum wun send (silver noodle salad) was one of worst I've ever had. It is supposed to have sour, sweet, and spicy flavors. They were apparently trying to put us into a diabetic coma with the amount of sugar they put in that overpowered everything else through the meal. Two bites of that was enough. The pad grapow (basil pork) a Thai staple was bland and tasted mostly like boiled pork with rice, nothing like the aromatic garlic, chili, basil traditional dish it could be. On the plus side the pladug phad prig king was OK, still bland with minimal spice and undercooked green beans but compared to the rest it was amazing. Still I'd pick almost any of the other many Phoenix area Thai restaurants over this one.",

I love Thai food and have had my share of different Thai restaurants but the food here has raised the bar so high other places just don't quite compare. You must have some of their Lemon grass soup (I order mine with shrimp). If you're in the mood for noodles their Pad Thai is very tasty! And any one of their curries (red, yellow, or green). If you like Thai tea it is quite tasty but a bit on the sweet side. Whatever you order, you need to try this place!",

Food came out very quickly after we ordered it, which makes me wonder whether they have prepared contents that they assemble by order??? If so, it explains the overcooked noodles in the Padthai. I didn't like the fact that they don't offer Padthai with flat noodles, but only with thin noodles... Took away from the whole Padthai eating experience that comes with the flat noodles and the flavors it generates. It was also extremely sweet marinated and had no particularly Thai spice flavors. The meat to noodle portion was pretty good though. Again, did not get Padthai as Padthai should look and taste. So far Royal Jasmine in Litchfield is my favorite Thai in West valley.",

    "text": "This place is legit.   I have been to many of the Thai places around Tempe, Mesa and Phoenix but this is about as good as I've tasted here.  I had the Fried Rice and Pad Thai on my initial visit and was impressed with both the taste AND the portion size.  Despite my slim frame I can pack down the calories and usually don't bring leftovers home in boxes.  I did here and it reminded me of a WONDERFUL place in Denver (Golden Saigon) that I haven't found an equivalent yet.    I will be going again and will try some of the other offerings but I was pleased with my meal and the price was affordable.   Now I've been in AZ for most of my life but I did live in New Orleans for 4 years so \"ghetto\" is an overused and should be relative term for people here.  Is the outward appearance impressive?  No.  But was I concerned for my safety in it's unassuming strip mall?  Hardly.  Inside the seating is comfortable and the ambiance appropriate.  Is this Snooze?  Heavens no  and people that are looking for that type of atmosphere seem to like to take pictures of their food more than really expand their palette IMHO.  If you've been to any legit Asian food restaurant in other cities they are much worse than this place and comparatively they have a good amount of space for the outward appearance.    I would highly recommend folks check this place out",

Everything was pretty good. Some of it I liked more than others but it was nice having something different. That said, nothing I tried really made me want to come back right away. I don't think it was the food so much as just my particular interest in the type of food. Service was good and it's a nice little restaurant. If you're into Thai, check it out.",

I read the reviews for this place & decided to try it out. The outside looks a little scetch but once inside it's pretty & clean.   The server encouraged me to try the red curry. My life has been forever changed!!! Every bite was every flavor perfectly fitting together. I read from one of reviews that they tend to run spicy so I went with the mild. It was just a low hint of heat that went perfectly with the creamy, savory, and slightly sweet sauce. I chose chicken to go with it.   I just can't rave enough about this place!!  A definate stop for me every time I'm in the Phoenix area.",

Modestly located in a little strip mall on the northeast corner of Northern and 51st avenue, this little gem will not disappoint.  First, the wait staff is some of warmest and friendliest, and strive to remember your preferences, from what you like to drink to your favourite table and spice level.  Soony, the chef - a native of Thailand is extremely accommodating and will make every effort to visit your table even if he  and his staff are backed up in the kitchen.  His culinary skills were honed at The Four Seasons Resort. He is most appreciative of the patrons that support him, and and is very diligent to accommodate your preferences.  From the appetizers (satay: my favourite) - the peanut sauce is made from scratch, to the nam sod salad and the entrees (the curries are brilliant), and the pad thai is not as  sweet as some American thai restaurant counterparts. The stir fry eggplant dish is wonderful as well. For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the mango and sticky rice.   This restaurant is quite a ways for me to drive (50 miles round trip), but it is well worth it considering the exquisite food, the low key atmosphere, and delightful wait staff.",

We were both incredibly happy with the way the tofu was cooked - it was ACTUALLY crispy - but just thought the sauces and veggies were \"meh.\"  I would be willing to try here again for one of their curries.

But...my mom had a coupon. I just can't deny her the joy she gets from using her coupons. So, we gave it a try.   From the outside, we were still unsure that the lure of the coupon would be enough, but we ventured in anyway. Inside we were surprised to find a nice, quiet little dining space. Aside from a family party that appeared to be finishing up their meal, we were the only people there, so we were seated and served very quickly. By the time we placed our order, we were a little relieved to see that other patrons were slowly filling up the dining room. There was only one waitress, but she still came by to check on us a few times, even after it got busy.   The menu looked great; there were so many choices! We ended up ordering the Ginger Chicken and the Spicy Green Beans with beef. Both dishes were fantastic. I just loved how they took a simple combo of meat and veggies and transformed it with an explosion of spices. I'm a big fan of spicy foods, but I hate it when restaurants just turn up the heat while ignoring the flavor of the dish. The spicy green beans were a perfect blend. The portions were huge; mom and I each took home some leftovers that were enough for lunch the next day. I can't wait to come back and try something new!",

All were quite tasty and were served with sweet and sour and peanut sauce. For lunch I ordered Beef Ma-Sa-Man Curry- It was very tender beef (almost like pot roast) simmered in red curry, coconut milk, potato's, peanuts, onion. Ry has the Duck with Pineapple Curry - red curry with bell pepper, onion, basil and Thai herbs. Both were served with white rice. They were very hearty portions and I even had left overs. Our server took the time to explain the different Curry's to us as well. I love this place!!",

The first time I came I ordered the Coconut soup Tom Kha with  veggies and tofu Thai spicy and it came out in one of those Thai metal servers with a  burner below.  Wow this stuff was so good and tasty, I could barely finish it because it was a lot of food for one, but I loved it.  I could really taste the fresh ingredients in the dish, and it was nice and spicy the way I like it.  Since then I've gotten this dish many times and love it every time. I just went again last week and thought I better broaden my horizons so I got the Panang curry and asked to have it with veggies with tofu because I gather they don't normally serve this with veggies.  Anyway they did a great job of making it the way I wanted and it was very good.  The sauce looked a little different (more brown) than what I'm used to from Panang but it tasted really good, and again they spice it appropriately for what I wanted.  It came with rice and I also asked for their tray of spices which I recommend to compliment your dish. I thought the quantity was very large and I actually had leftovers but because of travel I had could not take anything to go.  As others have said they don't have lunch specials but the prices are within reason considering the quality and quantity of food.  Also the people who own the place are very friendly and I was once able to talk with one of them about their restaurant and I was impressed how much they put into getting quality ingredients which I think is the big problem with most Thai restaurants.  Overall I'm envious that I can't get this kind quality in Cali where I live but will keep coming back when I'm in the area.",

The dining room is lovely and comfortable -- lots of carved wood on the walls and heavy, substantial furniture.   We ordered some appetizers, and split an order of our favorite, pad kee mao.  The appetizers were of the fried variety, and not bad. Nice and hot, not too greasy.   We ordered the pad kee mao medium hot, and boy was it hot! Not in a bad way though. I was glad to see lots of thai basil and plenty of fresh veggies. But the sauce was lacking that complexity, and combination of spicy, sweet, and herbal that I love.  I did notice lots of people enjoying the soup. So perhaps that is their specialty. Maybe next time, when I don't feel like driving too far again.",

I would recommend ordering pad thai one star hotter than you think you can handle as it is not as spicy as one might think. I ordered green curry with tofu at 3 stars and it was as hot as my hubby's pad thai at 4 stars. Overall the outside is sketchy and yes you are in the hood, but it is worth checking out if you can handle the sketchy mystique.",

Like I said the outside isn't much to look at, the building looks like it should make friends with a wrecking ball, but the inside is very inviting with nice decor and soothing music to forget about it all.    The food is a little better than average, but wouldn't say it is great in my opinion.  There are many other Thai restaurants that I have been to that fair better.  The portions come slightly less than expected for what you pay.  Service is relatively slow and don't expect your drink to be refilled right away to clear that spice out of your throat.  A server taking all the tables without any help can be a recipe for disaster.  Overall I'd say if in the area check the place out.  I'll be back, but it won't be in my normal rotation of restaurants.",

    "text": "When you drive up to this place, no amount of four and five star reviews can dispel the innate dread that is uniquely conjured up when you're visiting one of the seediest-of-the-seedy-looking Phoenix strip malls. You know the ones, bleached out by the sun, faux-gold-trimmed red letters blaring at you. The instinctive feeling that there is no way you're going to make it from your car to the door without being asked to loan a few dollars to a guy down on his luck but somehow inexplicably blessed with a handgun down his waistband.  Then you walk in. And it's like you're in a dainty Asian bistro in Scottsdale. Except there's one big screen TV and it's tuned to CMT. Ha ha, you smugly think to yourself - there's no way a TV would be tuned to CMT in Scottsdale! But then you are just taken with how lovely the place is. But WTF? Do you seat yourself? Two Asian women dressed as servers are fliitting about, but don't seem to see you (as it turns out, this is an unfortunate recurring theme here).   Eventually, one does see you. \"Two?\" she pantomimes, holding up two fingers but not actually speaking. \"Two,\" you say, acknowledging. They then seat you at the only table in the entire restaurant that is made for two. Neatly tucked right behind the kitchen's microwave, which you will hear beeping incessantly during your meal. I am being jocular, of course, but seriously, we looked around and we were both like \"wow, this is the only two-seater in the whole place. They must not get many parties of two!\" While I am trying to be funny, I'm not at all kidding about the microwave beeping.  During the remainder of the meal, the wait staff can only be described as \"oddly distracted and negligent, considering there were maybe ten people in the whole restaurant.\" There was no rudeness, and once our orders were in, food came VERY quickly. The thing is, it took fifteen minutes (and a pretty decent glare on my part) before a waitress came to ask us what we wanted to drink. Well thank you, since I've been sitting here for fifteen freaking minutes, I know not only what I want to drink, but what I want to eat. So we ordered.  When the food came, and it came fast, it was a blizzard of BRILLIANCE. I had the hot and spicy fish (hot), my wife had the pad thai (medium).  Both dishes were unbelievably delicious. I had mine \"hot\" and it was agreeably hot, I will try the \"thai hot\" next time just to see how much they can make me sweat. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. The appetizer of \"thai eggrolls\" was delicious, if meager.  During the meal we were asked if we wanted refills this many times: 0. We were asked how our meal was this many times: 0. We were approached by our waitress for any reason whatsoever this many times: 0. Once we were done with our meal, we flagged our waitress down (clearly, she was having a rough night, what with the 6 or 8 people left in the restaurant) and managed to get a check.   As bad as the service was, the food is so stupid good that I'm giving four stars anyway. Do yourself a favor: if you like Thai food, give Siam Thai a shot.",

This establishment could easily do a booming business in Scottsdale or Paradise Valley, but thank goodness they're here in Glendale and close to my house.  Tonight we had our usual coconut & chicken soup, served in the flaming hot pot.  It's a flavorful concoction brimming with chicken, mushrooms, fresh basil and herbs in a delicious lemony coconut broth.  The hubby had the stir-fried broccoli and beef, and I had the Shrimp and Pineapple curry.  I have to say that my curry dish was the absolute best Thai food I've had here in the Valley, thanks to the huge shrimp, big chunks of pineapple and fresh basil.  For desert we had the sticky rice and custard, served piping hot--delicious!  Although it was Sunday night, the place was almost packed with a steady stream of customers.  The waitstaff are all very courteous and patient, and they are quick to help decipher items on the menu that are unfamiliar to the diners.  There were a lot of people there who were obviously regulars judging from the banter between them and the waitstaff.  The restaurant is on the small side, with a total occupancy of 70. Just the perfect size make it accessible with a neighborhood feel.  We love the place and highly recommend it!",

The largest plus is that, unlike so many other Thai places, when a white gentleman such as myself say \"hot\", they actually make the food deliciously, sweat-inducingly hot. But in that regard, I'm a bit of a heat masochist. Medium is still very spicy for most palates and mild even has a slight kick to it -- as it should, mind you.

    "text": "Disclaimer and Qualifications: I'm a midwestern gringo, but I've been here 20+ years, so can take a little heat.  My wife is half Thai, and her Mom and Aunts used to sit around prepping, cooking REAL ACTUAL Thai food (and gossiping) all day long, so she knows the good stuff.  The first time we went, she loved it so much that the second time we went and got a TOGO order, we brought home over $75 worth of food for her, I, and a 12 yo girl.  This doesn't mean three $25 meals, either,  since each entree/appetizer ranges from a little under to a little over $10.  Yea, leftovers!  Instructions: 1.  Hire a group of thugs to tie you up, slip a sack over your mousse-head, toss you in the back of a cargo van, and dump your pretentious, elitist butt INSIDE the front doors of Siam.  2.  Enjoy the tastiest, most authentically prepared and flavored Thai food you'll likely have this side of Bangok, served by friendly authentically prepared and flavored Thai folk, in a very clean and ornately decorated, authentically prepared and flavored environment.  3. Go through moral, ethical, and spiritual crisis as you decide whether it is time to forgoe your judgemental, plastic-coated, dream world where everything is pristine and sanitized, so that you may indulge in the tastes of the real world, not the Real World tm.  4. Decide that you simply cannot face the ugly Glendale strip mall you know is outside those doors; have thugs kidnap you back to East Valley and drop you off at Kierland Commons, so that you can wash away the filthy feeling with an overpriced gourmet coffee amongst the beautiful people.  Pretend you didn't just start down the dark path of heroin-like spicy Thai basil & peppers.  Pretend that you won't be slinking back to the other side of the tracks to cop another score sooner than you think.  Look around at all of the fronts -- on the stores, and especially the people -- they want you to believe that they are authentically prepared and flavored, but they aren't.",

It does not look promising when you pull into the parking lot but don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is very clean inside and has very good food.  We started off with the Siamese appetizer. and one glass of wine.  Probably too much food for the two of us but we were hungry and ate it all.  All of the items were tasty but my favorite was some type of fried pork toast!  Probably not the healthiest thing but it was like fried French toast with pork.  All the sauces were good as well but was not sure what to do with the cucumber jalapeno salad thing so we just ate it as it was.  It was not spicy.  My wife had chicken Pad Thai.  (skipped the shrimp) it was the best she has had in our 2 years in PHX!  She asked for \"no spicy\" and it was perfect.  It was a very generous helping.  I had the red curry fish with brown rice, medium spicy, and it was also very good.  Medium spicy was just enough to have me wiping my brow about half way through.  Not overpowering but after several bites, you could feel it.  That was perfect for me.  Finished off the meal with a Thai Iced Coffee and they had to roll me out of there.  Two dinners, a large appetizer platter, a glass of wine and an iced coffee for $49.  We will be back again!!",

While not my favorite place to go for Thai food, this place offers a pretty delicious bowl of Tom Kha and Duck with Pineapple Curry  The Tom Kha is rich and creamy and full of delicious coconut milk but could use more lemongrass.  Whenever duck is an option on the menu, I naturally order that as my choice of protein.  While the pineapple curry doesn't have too much of a pineapple kick, the subtle hints of it gave it a nice after-taste.  Siam does seem to go light-handed on spice so if you're feeling bold, get it a level higher than what you normally order!  The place is kept very clean and the servers are pretty friendly.  I wouldn't exactly drive out of my way to come here but hey:  the food is warm, filling, and flavorful!  It's worth a try!",

My dad has been cooking with his Thai friend for years, so finding authentic Thai style can be hard, when you know what you're looking for.   Larb Gai was on spot, same with the Beef Salad. Sometimes Thai Restaurants make Beef Salad sweet (aka Americanized!), but this salad was perfect. The curries were all delicious- and to our spiciness expectations. Order a medium, you'll get medium. Hot is hot. You get the point.   My parents have came back multiple times, even bringing my grandmother, who had never had Thai before. The look on her face when she tasted the curry was priceless. For her birthday, guess where she wanted to go? Siam Thai. Who knew Thai food could reenergize a 75 year old Georgian grandmother.",

When I got there, they were quite busy  so I figured I would be waiting awhile but that was not the case.  They took my order and I was out of there in maybe 15 minutes!  Not pretty from the outside, older strip mall location but just like it looks in the pictures on the inside.",

The best all of us have ever had!  The staff is very friendly, the restaurant is actually pretty nicely decorated (in that red carpet kinda way), and the bathrooms were immaculate!!! Also - there is a baby changing station in the women's room; as a mom, I love when I see that since changing a diaper on a bathroom floor just ticks me off.   Anyway - hubby and I agreed that this (and Mi Patio lol) is now on the list of restaurants we go to whenever we are in Phx.   Ps - only slight drawback to this restaurant is it's in a slightly rundown area.",

I may live 25 minutes away, but it's worth the drive!  I ordered the broccoli with beef entree (number four on their menu) at the \"Thai hot\" spiciness. I had them fry it in their garlic sauce, as I'm not too keen on shellfish sauces.  The meal is excellent! The rice is cooked just so, and the beef is tender and moist. Nothing is over or undercooked, and tastes great!  Thanks for the great meal!",

You get 4 pieces for 9.95 I believe. I'm definitely getting that again.   Also, one of the best places for Pad Thai. It has great flavor, texture. The noodles aren't overly wet or too soft. This is our go-to place for Pad Thai. The chicken and shrimp comes with lots of chicken, but only 2 shrimp. So be quick if you eat family style.   Don't get the \"Thai spicy\" anything unless you actually can handle it.   I've been here a few times. Most everything was great. I just wasn't a fan of the fried tofu appetizer. It was pretty bland.

Either way, we will definitely be back and look forward to trying more of the menu! Side note-- the only thing that was not spectacular was the Pad Thai. Just average, noodles are very orange and sweet, I would skip that and just go for the other entrees instead. :-)",

The ice cream is made at the restaurant which is impressive! My overall experience was 10/10 with no complaints... for now.  Pad thai ($10 - $12)- sweeter than the usual but still good. Durian ice cream - creamy, strong taste but after taste is good Coconut - creamy with some coconut chunks",

The Pad Thai was much sweeter, there was less ingredients (meat, shrimp, vegetables) and the noodles were broken & soggy. The Beef Massaman Curry's portion was smaller and the fried banana wasn't coated in coconut shreds like before. Maybe the owners sold Siam Restaurant to someone else and they changed the recipes or maybe it was an off day?",

Quite a nice experience so far.  I ordered my goto favorite, Pa-nang curry, and they served a large bowl and double portion of rice for a very reasonable price. The presentation was nice. The meat tasted tender and fresh. The vegetables were cooked perfectly - firm but not crunchy. I went with Medium spice and it was just right.

    "text": "Best Thai food I've had!!  I LOVE Thai food, and I consider myself lucky to live so close to Siam Thai Cuisine.  Sure, the east valley is littered with great Thai food places, but the best one I've tried is right here in Glendale.  I'm a total white guy, so I can't tell you if it's the most authentic Thai experience out there, but can tell you it's delicious!  I've tried a lot of things on their menu, and have yet to be disappointed.  Their soups are fantastic.  For appetizers, the Satay chicken comes with a refreshing zesty pepper garnish, and the jerky kabobs (can't remember the name) are incredible.  The curries are excellent and varied as well, from the stew-like Masaman curry to the spicy Red curry.  You may be tempted to try the Pad Thai, as it's generally a good \"benchmark\" for Thai restaurants in general and is a common first-timer entree if you've never had Thai food...  It's different than other places (don't know which is more or less \"authentic\") and while it's still good, it's not something I crave.  As other reviewers have noted, the decor is MUCH more elegant than it's exterior would suggest. It's a total diamond in the rough and a great place for a dinner date.  Their pricing is lower than most other Thai places, especially for one of this caliber.  The quality and presentation of the food is top notch.",

It wasn't that anything tasted bad as much as there is better for the money out there.  The soup was overloaded with onions, not chicken unfortunately.  The noodle and curry dishes tasted over-blasted with powdered pepper, while lacking a bit in other seasonings.  Portions were also smallish.  The interior looks late 90's, and the service was confused at one point, mis-delivering a thai iced tea to our table that was later retrieved rather abruptly.  No, not that bad, just not that good in my opinion.",

    "text": "Ate here last night and was very impressed.  A lot of other reviews for this place are dead on.    First of all the place is right off of 51st ave the bright yellow sign is easily visible from Northern which was a plus because I thought it might be dug deep into a strip mall.  Its actually right on the corner of one.  At first glance from the outside this may seem like a place where you would immediately say no way and back out.  But don't.  The inside of this Thai place is very well decorated and the vibe is just positive.  It is very neat on the inside.  Carved wood tables,little Buddha statues,and just overall decorated in Thai.  It is very unique compared to others I have been too.  If it wasn't for the service this would easily be a 5 star.  It is a mom and pop place which means that there is two servers who serve as waiter,busser,and hostess.   They go around the restaurant and serve the whole place not just certain areas.  It took us a while to place our order but once we did the food arrived fairly fast.  The food was awesome.  Probably some of the best Thai in Arizona if not the best.  It is all served family style which works because the portions are so huge.  We had the lemon grass soup,the basil chicken,and the red curry.  The lemon grass soup was oh so tasty.  Little hints of lemon grass followed by a smooth broth with tons of mushrooms and chicken my mouth waters thinking about it.  The basil chick by far was the best dish.  The grill taste is indescribable.  The sauce had us almost licking the bowl it was so good.  The red curry was fantastic although not as spicy as I would have liked it but still good.    Overall very  good I was impressed.  41 bucks for 3 dishes 1 beer and 1 glass of wine not too bad.  This is a great date night place.    Warning:  Hot means hot here! and I mean Arizona hot!  We got our dishes hot and I was sweating.  Which I haven't done in a long time.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "OK, I have stopped by twice since the first review.  The service is still super friendly and welcoming.  The last time I came in, there was a large party seated near us that seemed to know next nothing about Thai food.  The staff was very patient with them.    Finally had the soup the last time I went.  At this point, I'm beginning to suspect that there is no such thing as bad lemon grass soup, because it really hit the spot.  So savory.  Went with my daughter, she gives it a thumbs up. We started with the fried tofu, which we both enjoyed.  They served up an impressive quantity of tofu. She ordered the Chow Mein Style Noodles with tofu, not something I would have ordered (why order a Chinese style dish here?), but it was pretty good. I ordered the Hot & Spicy Fried Rice With basil (and tofu).  Kinda wish I hadn't been with my daughter, because I got it mild.  Still tasty and fresh, but next time I'll order it hot.    We finished with the Coconut Ice Cream with Sticky Rice (or, as I have seen it named elsewhere, Snow Ball With Purple Rain).  This is a fantastic dessert.  If you've never had sticky rice, you have to try this.  The cold ice cream with the warm rice is spectacular.    OK, I had a late dinner at home tonight, but just typing out this review is making my mouth water.  Recommended.",

    "text": "Service 5 Food 3 Cleanliness 5 Atmosphere 4 Value 3  Pros: Friendly Staff Comfortable setting Fresh Ingredients  Cons: Pricey  Food of Asia has been the flavor of the month. I can't seem to get enough of it.... Literally no matter how much I eat I can't seem to get full. Which is exactly why this is not only tasty but in my favor for my current fitness goals. The right dishes let me pack in the good calories on cheat meals but limit the nasties.  I was ready for some more Thai food but the foodie in me had an itch to try a new place. Stray from the usual's and take a risk? We know Sala and E-San are tasty but sure why not. Food blog and yelp time! Landed here and after drooling over the menu had a mild obsession that had to be taken care of. Called up the usually eating crew and headed out.  From reading the other reviews I was already prepared to walk in the door and go unnoticed for a long period of time before I was seated. Seems someone listens because their door is now equipped with a pleasant chime that let the very busy, nice ladies, know my face was there and needed to be fed. Seems this is no longer a problem.  Very cool place in a very less then cool looking strip mall. My favorite kind of find! The whole place was done in Asian influenced stained wood panels. The obligatory Thai restaurant oversize tables/chairs were also in full effect.  The ladies took great care of us. As usual they got a laugh out of the big white guy order enough food for 10 people at a table of 3. All gone when we got up to leave, that's right! I know there are hungry people somewhere and no one will give me an address to overnight my leftovers.  I would like to give this place more then a 3 but something was flat in the food. I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but it bugged me the whole meal. Maybe it was missing some of the sweet my americanized palate had become accustomed to? I don't think that was it but something was missing from all but one of the dishes.  Duck Pineapple Curry: House specialty and I can see why. This was the best dish on the table. Something about the coconut and scalding pineapple chunks made for a great combo. Maybe the sweetness from the pineapple in this added what seemed like it was missing in other dishes. The duck was fatty but obviously rendered properly as it wasn't a vat of grease. Duck is often ruined in stews but someone knew what they were doing. Taste, smell, and texturally a happy place.  Panang Curry: My standby anywhere I go. One bite and although it was decent something was definitely missing. Not all curries are sweet(ie: massaman). I enjoy those as well but this one should have some sweet. It didn't and something else was off. First thought was skimping on the coconut. Disappointed face :/  Drunken Noodle: Fire! which I loved, but we had some gringos at the table so we specifically ordered it at a 3. If this is a 3 of 5 with a further option of thai hot I cannot fathom what Thai hot is. Whoa.. Now these were decent but someone got WAY carried away with the oil. That coats the mouth and dead goes the taste buds. So by bite 5 all I could taste was burning.  Tom Kha Gai: A very good version but not my favorite in the valley. Sala and Siam both beat this one according to my taste buds. Nothing unique or different worth nothing. Hit the craving.. no more.. no less.  Thai Toast: Oh freaking greasy awesome.. I love this stuff no matter how much I know its killing me. From the other reviews I was prepared to have to order a side of peanut sauce and pay for it. Volume wise you get your moneys worth. This was like no other that I had tasted. Much more of a goopey peanut texture and not a lot of flavors going on. Was kind of bland. What I like to call not worthy calories. What the heck was I even eating? I'm not sure. A few people said it was great so maybe an off night? or a crap we are out, open a can of xyz brand. Bleck.  Fried Banana/Coconut Ice Cream: Delicious as it is at all the places. Happy mini sugar coma :D I love coconut ANYTHING!  All this being said with all the other great Thai choices in the valley I will unlikely find myself back here. But it was a great little fling.. don't tell the others!",

They don't serve it with sticky rice, which is a bit of a bummer, but who cares? It was delicious.  There was only one waitress and a pretty busy night, but she was holding her own and very sweet, so that was good.  My friends ordered Pad Woon Sen and Pad Thai which they thought were really good too. We were happily stuffed campers all around. One of my friends was preggers (aka hard to please), so you know they threw down on her Pad Thai or we would've had some hormonal issues all up in that place. ;)  Definitely on top of my list for Thai food in the Phoenix area!

Seafood hot pot: the broth is really good- the seafood is ok, normally it would come with more greens- but this pot only contains various sea creatures and the broth. Pad thai- terrible! too sweet Papaya salad- it was ok, not great, and definitely spicy for a medium. Hot and Spicy noodle- delish!! I clean the plate good!!! i highly recommend this dish!  The setting is nice, clean and has imported Thai art around the restaurant. You get tamarind candies instead of fortune cookies =D YAY!!!

The second time we decided to eat inside. We got mild Pad Thai this time and it was perfect to me. It looked like medium spice. Let's just say my husband and I devoured it within minutes.   Their Pad Thai color is dark brown and full of flavor.  Their curry however, was disappointing. I like my curry thick not soupy. The balance of sweet and salty flavors confused my taste buds.

It is in a modest location bus step inside and it is a lovely place to eat. The food is wonderful. It is my go to for celebrations, comfort food or just great take out. I try to try something new but always get the pad Thai and satay to go with it.",

My husband loved it and wants ti go again....by the way the Thai tea with milk is really good. Can't wait to go back! Give it a try you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "The strip mall that Siam is in really sucks. Your first impression, when you park, is going to be suspicion. Everything in the plaza is a little roughed up, dirty, and out of date. But when you actually enter the restaurant, you're suddenly in a relaxing oasis of carved and stained wood panels, excellent tables, and attentive staff. The interior of a nice restaurant was teleported into a pit of suburban decay, and you forget what the exterior of the restaurant looks like the moment you're inside and enjoying the decor and gentle lighting.   Five stars with an asterisk: not everything on the menu is great. I give it five stars because it gives me what I want every time: curry and thai iced tea. Their tom yum is also pretty decent, and the presentation with the fiery soup bowl is always impressive. And the dessert with the coconut ice cream and the fried banana is pretty stellar. But I've also had friends order some items, like the fish cakes, with less than amazing results. Don't order the fish cakes. It's hard to point out any one problem with them, because no element of the dish was successful.  Additional warning: thai hot is hotter than you want. You don't have anything to prove. Thai hot will give you a nice rush and burn your mouth, but more urgently, it will jack up your insides. If you're going to order that way, bring immodium. I'm not joking. Regular hot is fine, but you're going to want medication if you try and show off.",

    "text": "Location: 51st ave & Northern (Northeast corner)  I don't really get the \"shady vibe\" some got from this location.   Inside, the decor is exotic, welcoming and...unexpected. Being in a strip mall, I didn't expect such attention to detail.   The Food: Fantastic. But oddly, whenever we eat AT the restaurant, the food is rave-ingly good. It seems when we take it to go, we've gotten dry, unimpressive meals a few times. Not sure what that's about.  I love that they use the broccoli stalks rather than the heads. Definitely cuts the gas factor down for me.  My favorite meals: * Crispy Fried Fish ($11.95) - Non-fishy tasting catfish in an awesome coconut curry sauce...mmmm...Ironically, the fish is NOT crispy but who cares? * Just tried the Pad-See-Yew Noodles last night ($8.95) and I looooooooooooooooooooved it. The noodles were buttery tasting and the fried tofu (you can choose from tofu, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, scallops, squid, or seafood combo) was a great firmish consistency. * Thai Egg rolls ($2.50 for 2) - Yummy but they contain chicken and now that I'm vegetarian, can't have 'em. * Fried Rice is yummy and fresh... Comes with cucumbers and tomatoes which is kind of weird but refreshing.  There's always plenty leftover for another tasty meal manana. The customer service is cordial and friendly.  The Bad: 1) Closed Mondays (weird day to close) 2) No website (in this day and age, there is no excuse for this. No one says you have to get all fancy and post the menu and stuff but even if you just put up 1 cheap page with your name, logo, address and directions...) 3) A few issues with takeout quality 4) The mounted flat screen kind of kills the ambiance.",

Watch the movie Genetic Roulette on YouTube for the complete story.  Soy, corn, canola, Hawaiian papaya, sugar from sugar beets and milk products that aren't organic  are most likely GMO.

As I ate, I noticed these things I thought were green onion, on further examination, they were small sliced chili peppers. Their rice was nit as fluffy as I usually like, but that's ok. I also got the red curry because the server said it was their most popular curry. Again, very flavorful and tasty. Service was very good, although, they weren't busy at all. Iced tea, was good.

    "text": "We went here for dinner Saturday night while visiting my cousin in AZ. She was raving how good this Thai restaurant was. I am from CA so I am very particular when it comes to Thai food.   Pulling up to the restaurant I felt a little uneasy. It was in a little shopping plaza with some businesses with bars on doors and windows. The parking lot was pretty vacant with a few cars. Entering the restaurant, the vibe felt much better. The place was packed. That's a good sign the food is good.   We were seated and menus provided. They were very busy and forgot to attend to our big party of 12.  I flagged down 3 waiters to get our orders. They all said yes and they'll be back but it felt like forever by the time someone came to get our order.   The papaya salad was good, not as fresh but good. The beef salad was good but there were no salad, just beef and basil mints and spices. The Tom yum soup was good. They forgot to give us bowls and spoons.   My daughter ordered Pad See Ew and my husband ordered Pad Thai. These dishes were disappointing. The colors look so dark and the dishes were so soggy. These are two main Thai dishes but they didn't get it right.   The best part was the ice cream! They make the ice cream themselves. It was heavenly!   The staff was very polite and friendly as well.",

The quantity was more than adequate but they messed it up on the spice level. Our medium was their bland. The food tasted good but nothing like the reviews where people claim this to be the best thai food in the world. The ice cream was pretty amazing. The ambiance was pretty decent but the location was a bit deserted and shady. I wanted to give it a 3star but the coconut icecream saved the day.",

The location was clean, well kept, nicely decorated, the service was fast, and the staff was friendly and kind.  We ordered a Pad Tai, a Duck Pineapple Curry dish, a Green Curry with Seafood Dish, and a Hot and Spicy Noodles with Basil.  The food was of decent quality, and everyone enjoyed everything.  The price is a little high but not still not astronomical.    After I finished eating I went to the loo to do some serious business, because I believe no experience is truly complete till one uses the loo and let it all out in the end.  For every start there must be an end.  Even if the end, ends in the loo.  What goes in must come out folks! It's a closure thing.    The loo was very retro, and old.  I can tell it would made around the late 90s or older.  It needed a bit of cleaning, and the toilet paper was running low.  Only standard issue toilet paper here.  The soap was of decent quality, it has a nice pleasant clean smell with a hint of basil.  The paper towels was of decent quality, not too rough at all, not bad.  The urinal was definitely not small children friendly.  The throne was only slightly more powerful than the common house toilet.  Be cautious doing curtesy flushes here.    Overall a decent experience,  not a bad place at all.",

We ordered the yellow curry with tofu and veggies, tons and tons of veggies and so good!! We also had the pad Thai with shrimp, the shrimp were a little overcooked though.

A speck of black something was floating in my water and she wanted to argue about it instead of just getting me another glass of water.  She also misunderstood my friend's order and was argumentative about it instead of just correcting the order.  Very unusual for a server to argue with the customer instead of just doing her job.  Not sure what that was all about, but it was NOT good.  Still like the food though, will probably order to go in the future.",

When we got here, I was suspicious because it's located in a small strip mall but there was hardly any light whatsoever, but when we got inside, I was surprised that the place is actually really nice!!!  The server escorted to our table, she gave us the menu and she asked if we would like something to drink first. I got water and my bf ordered Thai tea. I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars but I couldn't so I have to round it down to 3.  I've been eating Pad Thai a few times recently, so I wanted to be a little bit adventurous this time with my order LOL, so I ordered Pineapple fried rice (the last time my bf ordered this from another thai restaurant, it was so good), my bf ordered Cashew Nuts with beef.  I was so excited when the food came to our table. It smelled so good. But unfortunately, my Pineapple fried rice tasted just ok, it wasn't as savory as I expected. It was basically just fried rice with pineapple, that's all. And the amount of onions and bell pepper in the rice were INSANE. I collected them in another extra plate, and the plate ended up being half way full of those onions. Damn!  But my bf's food was tasty!!! The beef was tender, the sauce tasted delicious, I almost asked my bf to switch his food with mine lolll  Oh! Almost forgot, the Thai tea was fantastic! It was so creamy, would've been perfect with boba LMAO  I'm curious about the Pad Thai though, so I might come back to try it out.",

To my surprise when I pulled up to this place yes it looks a little dumpy however the inside is really nice.  The ambience, service, and food were all very very nice.    Food; For starters you must try the lemongrass soup and also their spring rolls.  I recommend you get Phad Thai or go with chicken and/or tofu green curry or red curry.  Their green curry sauce is one of the best in Phoenix.  Everything we tried was D Lish!  Restaurant;  Like I stated earlier, don't judge a book by its cover, The restaurant is well decorated, the decor is very nice and the ambience is nice.   We found the service on this day excellent.  Our server was very attentive and she was very knowledgeable about their menu.  She made some great recommendations.    After reading other Yelper reviews it would appear that this place has listened to some of their feedback.  I found this place to be a little hidden gem in Phoenix.

    "text": "My aunt introduced me to this this restaurant and I have been coming here since! My favorite dish is the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Seafood Hot Pot Combo. The Pad Thai, Chow Mein, and egg rolls are pretty good too. As for desserts, when mangos are in season, their sticky rice with mangoes are sooo delicious! The fried banana & coconut ice cream is also tasty as well. All the entrees in my opinion are pretty nice and large sharable portions. Never have I ate one whole dish by myself; I've always shared with 1 to 3 other people and its always plenty enough food for us. Siam is definitely my favorite Thai place to eat! It just makes me sad how empty this place always is... Check this place out! You won't be disappointed!",

Recommend: Peanut like flavored curry with chicken.    NOT Recommended: * I was not a fan of the papaya salad, it was overly drenched with prominent fish sauce and it seemed as though the salad may have been sitting out for a long while. Typically fresh Thai papya salad is firm, crisp...this lacked that.    * The Pad See Ew: noodle dish that has a charred sauce flavor was lacking in the sauce and the garnishment of peanuts.  I had the beef and it was dry, tough and had hard sinew. It was not at all appetizing and the noodles typically with this dish is a rice noodle that is flat, long, wide and absorbs and retains the sauce. This noodle was cut up in like 1 inch or less lengths, it did the opposite affect.  * Rice with the order was also underdone.  I LOVE authentic Thai food and Siam Thai underwhelmed in authenticity, portion size is very small, including the meat servings you may get 2-3  bits of meat/shrimp.",

However, the reason for only a 3 star rating is 3 fold. With my To Go order of Cashew Chicken, Medium and Pad Thai Chicken, Medium, the orders were messed up royally. Perhaps, it was because the place was very busy (over 30 people at 12:30 on Sunday afternoon). But, the waitress confirmed my order and I took it home. But, when I got home and heated up the entrees, I had 3 Surprises. The Cashew Chicken had only 3 Cashews in it; the Pad Thai was Chicken and Shrimp (only 2; and it's a good thing that we are not allergic to sea food). Now, my family and I like Spicy, but knowing Thai cooking the way I do, I was like, \"WHOA!.  If this was Medium, what on Earth would they consider Spicy?\" While I was able to eat it, my family was not. :( And, knowing what the next day or two will cost me, I ended up throwing the rest of it out. :( A shame to spend $$ on something that had to be thrown out. But, I will go back, again.",

The food was incredible! I had the shrimp & pineapple curry, it was delicious with just enough kick to it and wonderful flavor. I had lots of shrimp in my dish (sometimes restaurants skimp and only give you 2 pieces and call it good) so that was also pleasantly surprising. My husband had the pad thai (he ordered it as hot as he could) and definitely was impressed with the flavor and the kick as he has never eaten Thai before. Thank you for the wonderful food and service, we will definitely be back for more!",

Nice to find a place that serves tasty food and, at the same time, invests in creating a lovely space to round out the whole dining-out experience!  Had very tasty eggrolls to start, and they were some of the best I've ever had anywhere.  That is, besides my Mom's lumpia!  I believe Siam Thai's eggroll filling contain ground chicken, as well as eggs.  For my entree, I had the tofu green curry (as I use this dish to compare a new place to all of the other Thai restos I've tried thus far), and while I liked it, I found the dish too spicy (ordered medium spice) and found veggies there I had asked specifically to omit due to food allergies.  I normally send items back if they don't arrive the way I ordered, but I was hungry and I thought I'd just grin and bear through the allergy attacks as long as the dish was worthy of them.  (It's not.)  Mind you, it's tasty and spicy, but the cream sauce looked \"broken\" (I like mine silky-smooth and creamy!), and coupled with the veggies I didn't want, let's just say I'll speak up more the next time I go!  For dessert, I had the fried bananas and coconut ice cream, and oh my!  I've wanted to go back just to have this again, but alas, all my bookmarks have kept me from going back to do so :(  Soon.  So very soon...",

    "text": "Who knew they actually had at least one really legit Thai restaurant in AZ?! I would have never guess, until I walked into this little gem.   My husband was the one to find this place and I am SO glad he did. Any place that has an option to have you food \"Thai hot\" is alright with me! Some places we would eat Thai food, we would request to make it hotter than their hottest option because most of the time their version of \"hot\" was more like 3 out of 5 stars. This place does not disappoint on the hot factor. Thai food is my favorite and if you speak to any Thai person, they like everything hot, so it is a complete disservice if you don't eat their food hot because it only enhances the flavor.   Our service was fantastic, our waitress caught on to our humor pretty quick and she was joking around with us too. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and they were even very conscientious of our kids, speaking with them directly. I always like that. We ordered our staples, chicken stay, pad see yew, and beef red curry. All amazing. The only other place I have had Thai food this good was at a family party- no joke. I'm amazed because I've lived in a few places where Thai food, and people, were everywhere and this place is right up there with the best Thai food I've ever had. The place is still very hole-in-the wall and we had to travel from Anthem to get here, but it was well wroth it and will be worth it every time we come back. Who knew some of the best Thai food you can find in is Phoenix? It seriously rivals places in LA, you MUST try this place out if you are a fan of authenticity.",

My favorite dishes are the Green Curry (with beef, chicken, or tofu) and the Pad Thai is amazing, its not overly sweet or saucey like many of the other places out there.  They use alot of thai basil and fresh herds which is amazing, the flavors are really well blended with the perfect amount of spice. I always get the medium spice and its always been perfect. its not just some chili flakes that they put in for spiciness, its actually chilies and other spices that blend with the meal.  The eggplant dish is also very good, but hands down the green curry is my favorite.  Always fresh veggies and never frozen.   The location is a little scary, but one you taste the food its well worth it. Its actually really nice inside, the outside doesnt look inviting but like it said, it is well worth it!  Decent Prices as well, maybe a tad bit pricer like a dollar or two but its well worth it.",

It's one of the best Pad Thais I've ever had. I'd also recommend  the Iced Thai Tea, as it's is a great accompaniment to the meal. The Panang Curry is also good, though, not the best.  The restaurant isn't exactly in the most \"happening\" places of Glendale, but the decor is tastefully done - distinctive elephant shaped chairs, for example, complete with Thai music.   The service was good and prompt., and can be even better if they have more waiters.   In summary, if you like Thai, you'll love Siam Thai!",

I ordered the soup hot, being that I really enjoy spice.  I am fairly certain the waitress rolled her eyes while walking away as she seemed annoyed by me choosing hot.   I also noticed that while she assumed everyone else dining wanted rice, she mad an akward pointed question about asking if we wanted ours.  It made things really uncomfortable.

Having spent three months in Thailand I became a big fan of going from place to place sampling the various different takes on certain dishes. Siam provides the taste that takes me back to the great times I spent out there in providing authentic food with deep flavours with all the right ingredients.  The staff are incredibly friendly and always happy to help.  The food comes in large, family sized portions. This is especially effective with the soups (I thoroughly recommend the Tom Yum) that are presented in a Thai Fire Pot. Great for get togethers, just take the ladle and dish it out.  The only draw back to this is that if you are ordering for one or two people, it doesn't give you great scope to try a variety of foods (unless you want to go home with LOTS of left overs... actually no, that's a great idea!).  All in all, every return to Phoenix just isn't complete without a trip to Siam. Go try it, you won't be disappointed!",

They dishes are approximately $10 to $15 each. They even have a brown rice option for the more health conscious. Our mango sticky rice at the end was a little lacking though. The amount was rather economical compared to its price. For entrees, this place is solid and authentic, but I would probably go elsewhere for dessert.

Siam meets this mark. The papaya salad was delightfully spicy, and the tom yum soup was as sour here as it was in Chiang Mai.  The atmosphere is nice and a welcome surprise from looking at the outside. The staff were kind and attentive. Happy to have this place in the area!",

Back then, the food was incredible and 'Thai Hot'. And I mean HOT but never to the point of not being able to taste the dish - that's important. I haven't really had as good Thai food since and I often eat Thai when I travel. There are many good and some great Thai restaurants out there but Siam Thai Cuisine is nothing short of spectacular. Beware, Hot is hot here, especially the marinated green mango salad but wow is it good. Definitely try the Angel Wings. This is one of those dishes that I could never find as good as some of the original restaurants in LA but Siam does it up right.",

The neighborhood isn't great, but the food and service are outstanding. The restaurant is impeccably clean. I personally only write reviews on a restaurant that I have visited more than once or twice. Nobody is perfect, and even though consistency is desired, I have visited other restaurants the first time and had less than a desirable experience. Everyone has an off day or miss their perfection, so in my opinion, when the reviews are very good, and one or two write a bad review that is not consistent with other reviews, I ask myself. Did they just happen to visit on just a bad day? Or even their taste is different than others? Lastly, maybe there are some people who are never pleased. I can assure you I would not repeat a place over 25 times if it wasn't outstanding. This place is also 20 minutes from where I live. Great Thia Food!",

Service was quick and our order of 6 dishes came quickly.  I did not like rhe fried wanton or the stuffed chicken  wings.  I liked the spicy green beans , it was barely cooked that is how I like my vegatables. I also liked their garlic shrimp. It was loaded with garlic and basil. Their pad Thai was average. Portion was small. We also had their coconut  ice  cream with sticky  rice this was interesting.  I would rate the restaurant  3.5 stars . What I did not like that the added 20 % tip and then brought  the  charge slip that did not show the tip. I will  try again but it is not the best Thai restaurant  in town",

Papaya salad w crab is outstanding as well, I wouldn't order the crab with it  again, it did nothing to enhance the meal for me. The decor & layout  is elegant, the service was fine.

    "text": "I think I found my new Thai place. I also feel like I'm cheating on my old Thai place. LoL. I walked in and was greeted right away. I was already armed with what I wanted and ordered to-go. She was very nice and quickly passed on the order to another woman who gave it to the cook. The dining area was clean, quiet, dark and cool. There was a flat screen playing AMC (yay! I have no use for sports). There were a couple diners and listening to the waitress take one women and older gentlemans order, she was super patient. Explained everything to them and adjusted the order as needed. To me, its not just how they treat me, but others when they don't know their being observed.   I ordered Vegetable Red Curry (Yea, I'm obsessed with curry). I just said Hot, not sure if they go by number system or what. I waited about 5mins., in that time a couple to go orders were picked up - good sign, since it was 4pm yet. Not quite dinner time for most. Telling me it could get busy during peak hours.  I got home and opened my containers. First, the rice they give is a very large portion! It looked like 4 scoops. The Curry is also a large serving, good for two people or for two meals. It was filled with large vegetable pieces - carrots, snow peas, broccolli, etc. And it was HOT!! I was sniffling and sweating - omg! It was perfect! I had to stop and grab the fan and sit in front of it!  This place I will definently be going back to. Its a lot closer and a straight shot for me. Only 4 stars because I did only try one dish. I'm looking foward to trying the Beef Salad, Wonton Soup and other interesting dishes they have.  Update 9.3.13 - So I decided to dine in...and learned my lesson. I was seated quickly and just as quickly forgotten. Luckily I brought a book to read. The lady who sat me just walked away. Than a couple minutes later she sat a couple and quickly got their drink orders. I was a bit annoyed. But then another lady (Lek) appeared from the back 5-10mins later, she quickly got my order and gave me a glass of water.  Wonton Soup: First it is HUGE, omg I was embaressed becuase it was just me. Lek was like don't worry, you can take the rest home. Its good for 3+ people, and its only one size. It was really flavorful, had the huge chunks of vegetables, corn, carrots, leeks, etc. No spice to it and it was delicious!  Beef Salad: It wasn't a typical salad...when I think salad, I think lettuce with everything else. This came wiith slices of cucumber, tomato and a wedge of cabbage. It was a good portion sized and super hot! I didn't care for the cabbage, but with the cucumber/tomato was good. I actually went and bought a cucumber to eat with the beef salad the next day. A couple pieces were chewy, but upon inspection, (gross I know lol) it was the fatty part of the meat. It seems they don't trim off those parts.  Over all it was still a delicious meal, and Lek serving me improved my mood. She helped me the first time I came to this restaurant. Very nice and helpful, quickly bringing me anything I might need.",

LOVE the Thom Yum and the Thom Ka- great with chicken (and I hate chicken), really good with shrimp. The last time I ate here the shrimp seemed to be a lot better quality than a few years ago- so I'm pretty stoked for that, because a lot of places have really gross shrimp in Phoenix... you know that mushy shrimp that just seems icky... icky... right? That describes it? Icky shrimp. The shrimp they served me last time were plump and juicy and really good.  The fried rice dishes, excellent. The curries... pretty darn good. Pad Thai... yum... Cashew dishes, basil dishes... all GOOD. We always order extra veggies on just about everything and they always happily accommodate us with excellent fresh, perfectly al dente.  The area where you can find this awesome Thai restaurant may be described as pretty much, super ghetto- and beware, one day the guy that owns the liquor store next door came out and picked a fight with us for parking in front of his store, when he was closed for the day... That dudes a dick.  But, really, if you are on the West Side- this is definitely a good spot. I used to think Thai Rama was the stuff, but I think I prefer Siam now... Sorry Thai Rama.  My one gripe. Every single time I eat here, I ask for extra chili paste because my guy can't handle as much heat as me, so we end up ordering everything medium for his Caucasian palate- every single time they forget to bring the chili paste. But, what are you going to do? They will eventually bring it, we just have to ask again. My boyfriend said he figured out the secret- you have to ask for the chili paste when they bring your food out, or they will always forget.  One more thing, did I mention the servers are really nice, big smiles, very friendly... - 5 stars earned!",

    "text": "After discovering this place 2 years ago I think it is the best restaurant in Glendale if you want Thai. Maybe even the best in greater Phoenix. The service is very fast, and all the waitresses are super nice and friendly.  However, this place can be so popular at certain times that it packs out. Sunday's are filled until 4. Sometimes lunch times can get busy too but that is because they are just so good, people make it a regular spot. Closed Monday's so save your craving for another day. The heat index is more towards the generic audience, so if you want more than hot you might have to say \"Thai hot.\" I have been here dozens and dozens of times and they have never made a dish wrong.   My girlfriend will ask to get Tom Yum. Every week! She's loves it. The Pad Thai, Pad Prik King, and the cashew entree are my super favorites. The menu is in English but everyone here is Thai so if you can't find what you're looking for you can ask for it by the Thai name if you know that already. Tip the waitresses well, they are all going to college at GCU.",

I ordered the Thai fried rice with vegetables and added chicken with a spicy request of 4 on their scale of 1 to 5.  This was the oiliest, blandest fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was so oily that I feel like my skin is oozing oil now, and I didn't touch my food with anything besides a fork and knife.  They must have misunderstood how spicy I wanted it because it had absolutely zero spice to it.    Stay away from their fried rice.  Maybe other dishes are better, but I will never know.

I wouldn't have mentioned this in my review but I did because the very next couple that came in she allowed them to have the table I wanted. I'm not removing stars for that but that is what happened.  We ordered egg rolls that came out fast and were good.  I ordered the Pad Gra Pow. I liked that they added a nice selection of fresh vegetables to it and the sliced white meat chicken was cooked nice and wasn't dry. This dish tasted good but lacked enough Basil and that is the point to this dish.  Also this dish is traditionally made with hand chopped chicken that has more surface and gets more infused with flavor than sliced chicken so that would have been better. I liked that they offer brown rice so I ordered brown rice however the up charge was $2.00.  My husband ordered the Hot and spicy noodles with beef. The dish was fresh and interesting but the beef was a little tough and chewy and not too developed with flavor.   I was here before and had one of the curry dishes and liked that much more than the dishes we just had and would have given a higher rating if we ordered different dishes.  3.5 stars",

    "text": "This Thai restaurant is the worst establishment I've ever been to. I recently moved to Phoenix from Los Angeles and so I've experienced a wide array of Thai food. I am in no shape way or form a noobie to Thai food. After reading the reviews and having been matched with Siam, I decided to give it a go.  What an absolute disappointment...the first thing that came out was our papaya salad with chicken wings. I don't know if you could even call it that. The chicken was heavily battered in what looked like tempura, it was bland with no seasoning. The chicken was improperly thawed and drained of blood that it had coagulated blood. If you don't drain the blood, it doesn't look very appetizing and you'll get chunks of cooked blood around the joints making your chicken wing look black instead of white. If I wanted to eat blood, I would have gone to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered Bun Bo Hue. The papaya salad served here were crudely cut and soggy, instead of being fresh and crispy. I felt like I was eating something that was sitting out for too long.  After deciding that both items were inedible they were pushed aside. We waited for the our main course, panang curry and pad thai. Surely they can't mess this up??! Both dishes are very popular items. I was wrong once again. First off, the wrong type of noodle was used for the Pad Thai. Instead off the rice noodle I was used to, like in all the other establishments I've been to, they used noodles the thickness of vermicelli noodles. To give a better visible, think about chicken fettuccine served with angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine noodles. To make matter worse, there was grease pooled at the bottom of our pad thai dish. A puddle of grease is not something I want to eat, where does that even come from??  That was the last straw, I couldn't mouth another fork of food. If this is the quality of food that is served everyday I don't know how long this place has even lasted. This was an extreme disappointment to the point where it makes me mad. I spent close to $50 dollars on my meal and paid over 10% sales tax.  I will never eat here ever again.",

Very nicely decorated.  Service was fast and efficient.  We were well looked after by the wait staff.   I had an old favorite, pad thai.  That's usually the bench mark I use for measuring how good food is.  The pad thai was excellent.  Had it with chicken but there were some shrimp thrown in.  Got the medium heat and it was delicous!! Wife had one of the currys.  Ordered medium heat but she said that, while absolutely delicious, it wasn't as hot as she'd like it although she, too, had ordered medium.  Could be a mistake in the kitchen.  Anyway she said it was delicious. as well. We also got some egg rolls.  There were two of them and they were wonderful as well.  They come with a fruit sauce which was ever so delicate.  Very lightly pink but we couldn't tell from which fruit it came. The whole entire meal exceeded our expectations well beyond what we even hoped for. We both decided that this restaurant will go on our absolutely- must- revisit list.",

    "text": "Back in the mid-1980s when I first came to AZ, I used to go to Siam a lot.  I was stationed at Luke AFB and my boss out there was friends with the gentleman who owned the place and his wife, who was from Thailand.  It was my first exposure to the joys and wonders of Thai food and I have been hooked every since. Sadly, I did not go back after my friend left Luke and it was over 25 years since I last stepped foot into the place.  I have eaten at several other places which were mediocre at best, and I said many times to my family, \"You know, we should go to the Siam\".  We did not, only because it is a bit of a drive.  I went back last night.  WHY DID I STAY AWAY SO LONG!!  It has not changed from the way I remember it.  The service was first class, the food was out in less than 15 minutes, piping hot and was by far THE BEST Thai food I have had outside of Thailand - I have been in Thailand several times and eaten off the street vendors. The egg rolls were crispy and fresh and tasty and hot.   I had Thai spicy rice noodles with fresh basil and the flavor was amazing, it was fresh and dripping with flavors.  My son had the pad Thai and was in love.  The portions were large, and for two of us with full bellies it was $26 and some change.  I will be taking my wife there really soon.  This time, I won't be staying away for so long.",

I only do take-out but the hand-carved panels and atmosphere are really nice, lovely staff -- the place to go for Thai food in Phoenix. As good as the best in San Fran, Portland & Seattle.",

    "text": "Been going there for a couple years now. I love the food, the decore, and the selection of the menu.  Their Siam Duck, Teriyaki Beef, Green papaya salad, beef salad, and fried banana are all my favorites just to name a few. But I am having problem with the variation of the services I received there. They are mostly decent, but I had a very bad experience with one of the waitress when I visited last time. It was an early evening and we were the only one there when we first walked in. Two other groups came in after us shortly. While we were waiting to get our menu, the other two groups already got their drinks and placed their orders. We asked if we can be helped to place our order, we were neglected and ignored. I am not sure if it's language barrier problem, but it feels like she was yelling at us when we were wondering why we haven't been helped. We end up walking out there empty stomached.  Again, since I have been going there for so long and liked it so much, I don't want to give it a bad review. So I took two stars off the five stars that I would give them just for the food. Hope the services improve soon!",

Yes, the strip mall is not pretty but the restaurant is clean, well-decorated, and always nice and cool in the summer.   The food is what it's all about though. I'm addicted to the hot and spicy noodles with beef, would marry them if it were legal. I'm also a big fan of the soups, especially lemon grass. My boyfriend, who is picky about wonton soup, love theirs.",

    "text": "This place is good. I won't say great, but it's quite good. I wish they had vegetarian spring rolls. The only veg appetizer is the fried tofu, but when every entree you're ordering already has tofu in it, you don't really need tofu as an appetizer on top of it. I've been here about 3 times. It's good Thai food and worth a trip, but nothing sensational. Staff is great. The atmosphere could use a kick -- it's very dark and outdated looking on the inside, plus it's in a very nondescript strip mall. The staff is attentive though and very pleasant, and I would recommend this place if you were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

    "text": "I was first here a couple of weeks ago on a rec from a co worker who is from Thailand that this was as good as it gets in AZ, and boy was he right.  I always try the green chicken curry hot to judge a Thai place as the baseline (kind of like at a BBQ place you need to get the pulled pork and brisket to really judge the food), and it was excellent, with a good balance of flavor, very good consistency of the sauce and very tender, yet still al dente veggies and chicken (including some excellent baby eggplant).  Everyone else that i was there with got the pad thai for lunch, and they were all very happy.  The only reason that it is not five stars is the location, as it definitely not the best, but the decor inside was very nicely appointed and was a total shock compared to the exterior.",

We ordered a curry dish, a noodle dish and the Tom ka soup. All had a flavor that neither of us cared for..very bitter and rancid tasting. The beef in the curry had lots of fatty gristle on it and the Tom ka was severely lacking in coconut milk. I only had a bite of everything and then opted for a Wendy's hamburger..That's  how unimpressed I was. This place may be close to home, but you can bet I won't be returning. Steer clear of this one!!",
