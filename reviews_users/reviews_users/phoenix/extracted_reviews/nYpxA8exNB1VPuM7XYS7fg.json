The best thing is that they give you the burrito opened on a plate with the meat on it. You get to put in what you want from the salsa and vegetable bar. When I eat a burrito I don't normally eat the tortilla but I ate the whole tortilla. They bring the tortillas in from Mexico . Yum!! And the homemade salsa was awesome.  I will try to get back there the next time I am in Phoenix.",

Many times, even before our almighty Yelp, i have been victim to restaurants that claim grandeour when there is none. So I seek out The authentic... The revolutionary, the spot that sets the bar. So... I have to admit before my affinity was shattered... El chino had me sold. I raved to my masses of there quality and taste. I was of the first to walk in to this hole in the wall. Then, was El Chino, in the back killing it... Like magic churning out delight, savory stews, grilled heavenly morsels... And I its cheerleader as I licked my fingers clean. But loyalty draws me to my fan fare regularly... And on this dismal day my accolades shattered and I witnessed as others a very different El Chino. The fault, I believe was the absence of their namesake. El chino was nolonger there. And I in horror saw Microwaved left overs from fridge to nuke... coagulated disgust shoveled to my wifes tortilla... How as her man, allow it to transpire... No not me so i called them out... And struck them down. Read my others and 1 is a  response to a message sent denying what we witnessed.",

I came in after a long hiatus from tortillas as I was dieting and when the lady at the counter took my credit card, she realized it was me.  She called to the back and couldn't believe I was there.  The kitchen staff said that we missed having you here during lunch and wanted to make sure I was satisfied with everything. Well I am.  Its just food this good needs to be taken in moderation, because it is easy to get carried away here.  Everything is good. I have crossed up and down the menu several times and when it come to cabeza and cachete(cheek) tacos and burritos, this is the PHX spot hands down.  Plus they let you load up your burritos with plenty of fixings before they fold it up perfectly for you.   Its proximity to the State Capitol makes it my favorite quick taco between committee meetings or a great place to sit and debate policy over some tacos and horchata.   So thank you to a place that makes you feel like you been away from home too long.",

I even told the owner \"there are some places but\" and the owner finished with \"but no one does it good.\" We both laughed.  I ordered 3 tacos and a torta totally underestimating the amount of meat that I was getting and took it home.

The other meats are delicious - the pork, beef, turkey, cabeza, and cachete are all fantastic. This was the first place I've tried cabeza and cachete, and those are now my two favorites.

Went to El Chino over the weekend during my visit to Phoenix-- and I can't get these tacos off my mind! My fiance and I visited from Portland and this was pretty much the best part of our trip. He's from Cali and I'm originally from Phoenix, let's just say we crave good Mexican food when we come to town and El Chino nailed it. I think together with my parents, we ordered five different tacos and they were all amazing. The consensus was that the carne asada was the favorite. The tacos were a lot bigger than we expected, but that was the best part about them. They aren't anywhere near those dinky street tacos-- so come hungry and ready to eat!  If we could pack up the restaurant and take it with us, we totally would. Open a location in Portland, please!",

We moved onto burritos and then more stuff on the menu. The owner, El Chino was an awesome guy. So laid back and helped us venture through the menu. He was a great host.

Once we entered we were greeted by the friendly staff. The family ordered multiple tacos & a quesadilla. I was busy on the phone with a friend while taking a bite of my Carne Asada taco...I had to immediately hang up & take another bite then made my way to the salsa bar. Lots of variety of toppings to your liking. I kid you not. The food was so good that we placed a second order. The staff asked if it were our first time & they graciously gave us a bean & cheese quesadilla which was good as well. Overall great ppl & awesome food. We will be back for sure.",

I'm not sure what the restaurant was before this taco shop but whatever it was the universe is better off without it because it brought us El Chino. The tacos are delish. The burritos are delish. I've tried almost everything by now (several items I had never heard of and a few I never thought I'd try) and everything is delicious. Juan, I believe in of the owners, is very friendly.. The cooks in the back pump out some amazing food like a well oiled machine. Even when it's busy I don't have to wait long for my order. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "There isn't many things In my life that will bring tears to my eyes... The one ill admit too is a bomb taco! Its hard to find good tacos out here in phoenix because many places think they have to put a million toppings on it and fancy it up. Im old school, give me a tortilla, fill it with deliciously seasoned meat cilantro, onion and some good flavored hot salsa.... That's what El Chino gives you. I ordered 2 tacos one barbacoa (flour tortilla) and one carne asada (corn tortilla) and my buddy and I split a barbacoa burrito.   The salsa bar is freaking amazing! It literally has everything you can possibly want, even a few more items that I personally think dont belong on a taco or burrito.It was nice though, I got my tacos with tortilla and meat and it was my decision what went on it. The burrito was left open, they let me put any items I wanted on it then they took it back wrapped it, and cut it in half for me.   The Carne asada taco fell short of really rocking my taste buds.. The corn tortilla was very dry the \"carne asada\" was apparently ribeye. It was descent meat but there was sooo much fat mixed in. Now moving on to the barbacoa taco!!! Holy crap it was bomb!!! the salsa mixed into the seasonings they put into it made it so much better! I devoured that bad boy!!!! The burrito was above average, only problem I had is that they charge extra for rice and beans.. Seriously bro, that is just filler.   Overall id go back for barbacoa tacos on flour tortillas. This place isn't cheap either, they charge extra for everything. Worth a shot if your in the area and like tacos.",

Very poor customer service..I went in with my family after church on Sunday there were 11 of us, we walked in and from the beginning the owner was very short minded and impatient with us, especially with our kids. That's was overlooked by our group until we had our second bad experience....the food came out and the carne asada tacos were discolored, under cooked and cold, definitely not up to to carne Asada standard, we ate them because some of us were trying the tacos out for the first time and thought we'd give them a shot. We also ordered sides of rice and beans. No....not even 20 mins after, more than 1/2 of my families stomachs were hurting. We had cramps, we had 3 people in my family throw up their food afterwards. Even my baby niece was having Diarrhea after she ate the beans and rice. We will never spend a dime there again, from the poor customer service to the disgusting tacos they served. I am extremely unhappy with our experience there. Hope this give some insight. Thank you.",

Tastewise they're OK, although I find that adding a bit of salt wakes up the flavors significantly. And there's a good salsa bar offering lots of stuff to dress the taco with; definitely don't forget to add the pickled onions on your tacos or burrito. You may find a line leading to the counter if you come around lunch hour, but the line moves reasonably fast.",

One of if not the best salsa bars I've seen.   Fill up your burrito and they roll it back up for you.  The place is always clean and the staff hospitable.  Not cheap, but inexpensive delicious Mexican fare.",

    "text": "While its no secret Downtown Phoenix has quickly emerged as a destination for great culinary fare, the same really can't be said for the area around the State Capitol.  At least not yet.  The neighborhood seems ripe for it with all the government employees in the area and it feels like all it would take is a few mom and pop shops to get the vibe going.  Well, now folks near the Capitol have their very own culinary destination.  It may not look like much, but Taqueria El Chino has all the makings of a neighborhood staple.  As I write this, Taqueria El Chino is currently rated as one of the top 40 restaurants in the city of Phoenix according to Yelp.  So investigate I must.  And hey, today was National Burrito Day so why not.  I arrived around 4pm just after work (before the dinner rush) and was looking to get some solid Mexican fare to go.  The building is on the southwest corner of 18th Ave & Van Buren in what (in all honesty) looks like a condemned building from the outside (parking is just around the corner).   The inside however is pretty relaxed.  The owner Rafael was manning the register for me, was super courteous and ready to guide me through the ordering process.   Any of you who've read my reviews in the past know that I usually try to get a full experience whenever I go someplace new.  So while I was of course going to get a burrito today (a carne asada burrito in fact), I decided I'd go a few steps further.  In addition to my Carne Asada Burrito (a.k.a. a grilled ribeye burrito), I went with a Barbecoa de Pavo Torta (barbecued turkey sandwich), a Barbecoa de Res taco (barbecued beef taco), a Barbecoa de Puerco taco (barbecued pork taco), and a Pechuga de Pollo Quesadilla (chicken quesadilla).  Total cost for all the food and tax (no drink) came to about $24.  FYI, I used the Yelp check in to get one of the tacos free.  Also, as other Yelpers have noted, you can dress up your food anyway you like at the salsa bar at no extra cost.  Got my food to go in just under 10 minutes.  One thing I appreciated is they separated many of the ingredients in the to go boxes so that no items would get soggy and gross on the way home.  Once I got home and constructed my meal, it became clear to me that I went way too far with this order.  The portions were clearly bigger than I could handle in one sitting.  But I'll give you the rundown.  First, the quesadilla.  Awesome.  The herbs & spices they used on the chicken were fantastic and the chicken to cheese ratio was probably 80/20.  If you like the cheese to be the star, this quesadilla probably wouldn't be your thing, but I was a happy camper.  Next, the torta.  The turkey was pulled so it kind of had the consistency of pulled pork, but I wasn't complaining.  They stacked it high on the sandwich with toasted bread and I dressed it up from there.  Spot on.  Next the two tacos.  I would say the pork taco was my favorite of the two, but the beef was also excellent.  And both go great with Chino's green tomatillo sauce.  And of course, the burrito.  I didn't dress this one up to much (just some rice and beans), but that was on purpose.  The spices and herbs they use on the ribeye make this a tasty way to cap the meal (or at least what I could finish).  Taqueria el Chino is by no means the only Mexican food stop in the Phoenix area that will knock your socks off.  But its definitely the first I've found around the State Capitol.  I imagine many Capitol workers and staffers will be frequenting this place if they haven't been already.  The staff is friendly, the food is awesome, and the atmosphere is humble.  Next stop here for me will likely be for a horchata run.  I would say learn from my goof-up and exercise some portion control.  But when the food is this good, go nuts.",

So I took a 40 min walk from Downtown Phoenix to this place and holy crap, are these tacos super authentic and delicious!!! Got the ribeye, barbacoa and cachete (cheek) with the latter being my favorite.   The flour tortillas had that awesome bite to them, the meat was super flavorful and juicy and they let you add your own toppings at their salsa bar. You have to add the red onions and their salsa roja which is spicy (and they warn you) but so so so good.   The tacos run you like 2.50-3.00 so it's pretty affordable if you ask me. The owner mentioned them opening up a location near Central and Grant in March/April so I'm hoping its way closer to my hotel because I'm definitely going back.",

Not like that means anything because I fancy myself a connoisseur of anything delicious....pizza, hamburgers, sushi, breakfast burritos, BBQ, pasta, pho, ramen, etc.  That said, don't let that deter you from reading this review and going to TEC tonight. Actually, no, stop what you are doing right this instant and go IMMEDIATELY!! Listen, these tacos have made me want to be a better husband, father, and overall human being. It's for the greater good that you visit ASAP.  But, seriously, these tacos are some of the best in Phoenix - on par with La Santisima, Tacos Sahuaro, and Tacos Chiwas. I can't speak for every meat on the menu, but the adobada and carne asada are out of this world. I can only assume that the other protein options are just as good. If that wasn't enough, the salsa bar and service are top notch as well. The building and area are a bit suspect, but that's half the fun, right? I would never think of steering my fellow Yelpers wrong. Do yourself a f(l)avor and go stuff your taco hole with some deliciousness and thank me later.",

If you think I'm being sensitive let me ask you Phoenix locals, how many asian friends do y'all actually have? And if they're not bothered it's because they've been down playing asian racism their whole lives just to fit in when living in the Valley lol So please, get cultured   Service: 1 star  The man whose operating this location was rude and rushing us when there was no one here. He reminds me of your gruff macho uncle whose impatient, emotionally abuses his wife, has gray morals but a good heart and decided to run a restaurant. 1 star because of the cook in the back, she was sweet and smiling. Also when he took our atm card he was tapping it excessively as he jammed out to Selena after being rude--anyway just plain rude in his interactions lol yeah, he's not everyone's  favorite uncle that's for sure.   Price and food: 2.5 stars   Carne Asada was bomb and prepared wonderfully to go by the cook--but was expensive when there are cheaper taquerias in Phoenix (is it because we're in downtown it's expensive? Because the area isn't nice at all and we were bugged by homeless people, just saying)   Barbacoa was waayyyy too salty which was a shame because the texture was great. However no amount of lime or salsa could cut through that salt.   Salsa: watered down and lacking in flavor--or rather they all have this one spice that makes them taste all the same, but I'm not familiar with the depths of Mexican cuisine to pinpoint that certain spice. Anyway, it's watered down salsa, maybe to cancel out the salty Barbacoa?   Nonetheless, I wouldn't come back. Wanted tacos and this was closest by. Please invest your dollars somewhere where the owners appreciate you as a customer. There are more affordable and delicious places here in Phoenix who don't water down salsa to compensate for salty inedible food! Carne Asada was bomb, and the owners I'd like them probably in another setting just not a business setting.",

I can deal with the crowdedness, and slow service, however I really don't like staff that is rude and the cashier, well we must have caught her on off day because she was very rude.  On this visit I had the beef Barbacoa burrito and my lunch companion had the pork barbacoa; both were mediocre.  The tortillas were good, the meat was somewhat average, nothing special.

He suggested I go try it and I did, and not it was a great joint for some Mexican food. You put your order in and they give you an open borrito  to go add the extras form a salad bar kind of station.   The lady at the cash register was very friendly and the gentleman behind the food bar made sure food was prepared to order and asked how it was after we finished.   I ordered a carne a sada borrito with red sauce and it was filling, delicious and full of flavors. I got a cup of soda with it which was probably the only disappointing thing that they charge a dollar for refills, in advance.   Any way, this was an amazing place with majorly great flavored food and ok definitely be back.",

When my order was called I asked where my beans were. \"She's getting them , give her a minute\" rude. I ordered beans and looked for a spoon when asked the same girl and was told that they \"didn't have anymore, we ran out\" NOT TEN DA$& mins later she is stocking all the plastic cutlery and guess what. I even heard people behind me complaining the she over charged them.  Too many other good spots to put up with this crap.   Sad sad sad",

There is a bat with cabbage and  salsas, but no cheese. The meat has a lot or liquid and is runny and makes the taco fall apart. I will not go here again. The beef was way too salty. The turkey tasted ok but was runny with all the liquid and made the taco hard to eat. The menu was hard to read. I don't even know if cheese was an option. I found beans on the menu later after ordering. There are no chips and salsa available even for purchase. No guacamole available. I don't feel like it's a legit place. It's kinda like ham no burger; peanut butter no jelly. What is goin on?",

The second reason will be the service. My coworker and I decided to call in before arriving since we were going to be late for our meeting, we were also ordering for others as well. My friend put the call on speaker and I could tell the order taker was getting very annoyed, which I understand because my friend was being quite complicated. Yet, when we arrived the order taker turned the annoyance into rudeness and that was not okay for me. I should be giving two stars but the manager definitely made up for that, because he was making sure we were okay and being very friendly and welcoming which I totally appreciate!   HOWEVER I still paid a little over $13 for what ended up being only two tacos & a drink since my rice and beans were missing. As for the taste of the tacos they were pretty good I just wish they would automatically come with all the toppings. I find that when they come with everything it accentuates the taste. Plus there was a lot of fat spots in the meat that made the texture quite chewy.   Conclusively, I would totally give this place another shot! I just wouldn't never order to go.",

    "text": "The proverbial hole-in-the-wall:  My co-worker and I was originally there to provide support. When we got here, there was ample free parking adjacent to the building. At first, we weren't sure we were at the right building because the exterior looked like a bar that was in need of a facelift. Nevertheless, we walked towards the entrance facing the main road, and went inside.  I had brought a lunch that day, but I came away with a taco. Because I HAD to.   How it works:  This place offers a number of different meats: carne asada, barbacoa, pechuga de pollo (chicken breast). You then choose what type of dish you want: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, or tortas. I chose a single carne asada taco and my friend ordered a carne en salsa verde burrito. You can choose to add beans, rice, and/or cheese for an additional charge.    From there, you get your dish without any toppings and head over to the salsa/salad bar to choose whatever you'd like. You then bring it back to the counter and they wrap it for you. We were getting it to go, so they wrapped by taco in some plastic. My friend brought his unwrapped burrito back to the counter so that they could finish putting it together.   Service: everybody we interacted with were super friendly. I think the owner was the person who greeted us. They were excellent burrito wrappers too.   Food: Everything tasted very fresh. The salsa/salad bar was clean and nothing looked like it had been sitting for more than a couple hours in the chilled compartments. The meats were really tasty too!   Price: It's not the cheapest Mexican place, but you get what you pay for in terms of the quality of food.  I'll be back for lunch.",

First of all, there's parking adjacent to the building, which is awesome; second, it is easy to get in and order. You can smell the smoky grilling beef of the carne asada. All you need to determine is which of the tasty meats you want and in what form of tortilla, corn or wheat flour, do you want it served on. It doesn't really matter, everything we tried was good: we tried a few of the head meats -- cabeza, cachete -- very delicious and tender, the cheek meat was possessed of a big beefy flavor; the carne asada was generous and very delicious. My colleague enjoyed the frijoles, which she claimed were the best frijoles she'd ever eaten. The salsa bar was well stocked with fresh produce, and had, in particular, a salsa roja, made with arbol chiles, clearly labeled as hot. Readers should be forewarned this is a bit of a misnomer: it's very hot. It's called memory sauce for a reason: you'll remember it later on. Service was personable and helpful; the tacos come out not all at once, but piece-wise, but, it means you'll get up a few times to get the rest of your order as it's filled.",

    "text": "Visited today with my wife after a long hike in South Mountain Park. Wonderful greeting from the owner sincere and friendly. We had amazing barbacoa puerco (Pork), barbacoa res (Beef), Cabeza (braised meat from the head), carne asada (Ribeye) and then finally 2 bean burritos to go. Wow absolutely the best mexican food I have found in entire city. I do reviews maybe once or twice a year. We will be back as everything was fresh and flavorful and overall very clean. Give this place a try there is a reason they have 5 stars and 30 plus reviews. Side note we visit Mexican restaurants about 2 times a week and very rarely go to the same place twice. This place is going to be on my travel routes weekly. I did learn a little bit about where they source their tortillas and I also get mine from there and know how hard they can be to get ahold of.",

Wasn't sure what to expect and we were PLEASANTLY surprised! service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! My husband got three different tacos and I got the Barbados burrito. Both were wonderful. We also got a cheese quesadilla for our daughter who powered through the whole thing. Clearly homemade tortillas. So yum!

The ambiance is a little noisy for my taste and the service is a little disorganized (when your food is ready you take it to a condiments station to load it up and then, if you have a burrito, you take it back to the counter so they can wrap it for you) however the food was really good. We had Carne asada and pork barbacoa, cabeza and lengua, and all of it was really good. My husband went back for seconds. When a slight mix up occurred (we got a barbacoa taco when we ordered the carne asada) , the manager asked if we would like to keep it while he got us the right order a classy move.   Also, the red salsa... Super delicious and super spicy. My husband loves spicy salsa and is often underwhelmed with claims of spicy salsa. This one however, fried his palate. We will definitely be coming back for more.   5 people eating (2 kids)  and the total came out to $45ish.",

I ordered a side of the beans and couldn't stop talking about how happy my taste buds were, and then their sadness upon being done. Service was very friendly and efficient, and our party of 11 was able to get in and out in under the hour we needed to meet our appointments. Best street tacos I've had in such a long time!

If the service was any faster, I swear someone read my mind when I walked through the door. I enjoyed my carne asada burrito so much, I went back and ordered two carne asada tacos. Everything was delicious. I'm not setting foot in Phoenix and missing an opportunity to grub here again.",

Friendly staff too. The red spicy salsa will make your mouth burn in a good way... But beware... They ain't lying on the spicy level. Decent prices and a wide selection of fresh foods. Good spot for anytime you're at the AZ state fairgrounds.",

My husband ordered the same with 2 carne asada tacos on the side.  They have a salsa bar with fresh pico, cilantro, limes, salsa, and onions you can top your plate with.  The carne asada was so delicious!  I work near the capitol and already can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu.  Prices are really reasonable and the customer service is awesome.  They walked up to our table and offered us refills, boxes to go, and even take our empty plates. If you are in the area this is a must stop.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying... I don't give five star reviews often, but when I do, it's with a purpose!   When you come to El Chino's, it's not in the vest of neighborhoods or a mega shopping center, who cares about that??!! When I am hungry,  the only thing that I care about is GOOD food and a clean restaurant, and quality service is always a plus. I will tell you this place has ALL THREE! The owner was super appreciative that we went off the beaten path to come to his restaurant. I would tell you to close your eyes and read this review as if you were me, but that would make much sense!  I had the carne asada burrito and I have to say... hands down, second to none, and without a doubt, this is THE BEST carne asada burrito I have ever had in my life! They make the steak for you and put the rice and beans on your burrito and then you add all your toppings (kinda like a self-serve Chipotle) then you give it back to them and they wrap it for you. My burrito ended up being about the size of my forearm!  I literally thought about this place all day... the best meal that I have had in a long time, and if I was anywhere close to this place when I return to AZ I will go out of my way to come back here. Without question. Without hesitation.  Awesome job El Chino's... you gave me a complete different appreciation for authentic mexican food.  I. Cant. Wait. To. Go. Back.   Now....... I am drooling",

They have a salsa bar that you take your food over to and choose toppings. I chose cilantro, pickled spicy onion and green salsa on my first one and pico on my second one (yes, I went and ordered seconds). I HIGHLY recommend making a stop to try a few tacos here. I also had the barbacoa pork taco. O.M.G. it was ah-ma-zing! Its juices were so flavorful and the meat was perfectly cooked and soft. I wanted to drink the drippings from my plate. But, that wouldn't have been lady like. The service was very pleasant. Everyone was kind and wished us a good night. Even the cook said good bye as we left.  I will be going back at every possible chance I get!!",

I now have a True food addiction to this place and go a few times a week. They also offer turkey and chicken options if you don't eat red meat, which is a plus!! You leave craving more and without the feeling your pores are oozing grease. This is quality food and cooked/seasoned to perfection. I look forward to each visit and their staff is always so welcoming and accommodating. This place is a MUST stop and so reasonably priced as well",
