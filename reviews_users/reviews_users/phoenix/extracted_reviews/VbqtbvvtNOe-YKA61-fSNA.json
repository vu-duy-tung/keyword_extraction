The restaurant wasn't busy but the bar itself has nearly every seat full. They have fried pickle spears, regular and cajun.  A must try!  I had their Papa Dillos last time, loaded mashed potato balls deep fried....they were just okay.  I liked the mellow vibe here and they have an enclosed patio for smoking out front.  It had been awhile since I had been there so I'm not familiar with the food menu and would like to go back to check it out.  I'm a fan.",

AG has nice, big spears fried in a tasty batter with ranch. From 4-7 you get 6 big spears for $3.  The beef stroganoff is great too. Once you get past stroganoff using bow tie pasta you'll love it.  A little loud at times, lots of sports on the various TV screens, crowded bar area.",

    "text": "The Armadillo Grill really surprised me. A dive bar in the midst of all the pretentious restaurants and shopping center around the Baltimore area. A resturant / bar with pool tables and a bunch of tv's with sports. I love dive bars, however, I also like when they grow with the times.  I couldn't imagine coming here to watch a game, because despite their large quantity of TV's they are all too small and cheap in quality.   We came on a Monday night late because a friend of ours has been out of town for a month and we wanted to meet up the SECOND she got back. I had the wings, (I'm sure you are shocked). The size and cooking of the chicken was fantastic, however I'm not a big fan when bars use breaded wings instead of grilled.   The ladies got chopped salads which actually looked phenomenal. I def got 'out ordered'.   I probably will only be back if a buddy wants to meet here, but I certainly can't see myself coming up with the idea to meet here for drinks especially in the Biltmore area where there are just so many other better options.   However, I will say that this place probably has that local, consistent customer base where the same people frequent it on the same night of the week. A total cheers atmosphere for sure. So if you are close and live in the area and are looking for \"your dive\"...this'll work.",

There are many nice-sized screens to watch whichever games are on... however, when I was there to watch the Sunday morning NFL games, they were having a very difficult time coordinating the broadcasts. Without warning, my game was switched out with under two minutes to go in the fourth quarter, which was mortifying. At one point, multiple screens were broadcasting a QVC-style infomercial for collectable coins as multiple confused patrons stared on with bafflement.  The reason why this is a four as opposed to a three is a combination of the redeeming products and service quality, and also because the manager was responsive and clearly making a real effort to fix everything. If/when they figure out their technology, this place is a five.",

    "text": "Armadillo Grill has always been a great go-to for good bar food. Besides general bar-fare, they offer some of the best weekly dish specials a bar can conjure up. They are not simply a OTB or pool hall... they are much much more.  ~Fud/Drink~ As stated, they have superb dish choices each week. They do seafood/fish surprisingly well. The most memorable dish from here was actually a Basa filet in mushroom gravy and perfectly grilled veggies along with mashed potatoes. That, my friends, is NOT traditional bar-fare. The chef they have locked up (love that comment Joe S.) does a stellar job. Please don't forget they offer all the traditional fried food options you can dream up. But this is a multidimensional bar, which makes it so unique. They also have stellar drink specials throughout the week and into the weekend. The barkeeps keep regulars happy with free-flowing drinks and will make your day as well if you stop in! They offer a full bar along with beers of different variety as well as select wines to be pared with your special dishes if you purchase one.   ~Atmosphere/Service~ Once again, service is superb every time I go. I am by no means a regular, but they treat you like one. I feel at home here when I come in to have a bite or shoot some pool. There is no real dive atmosphere, its truly an interesting mix. The inside is by no means \"nice\", its a bit older and adds to the general feel of the room. Along with the bar area with the regulars and the OTB on the screens with rooting betters, it surely is an interesting collection of atmospheres in one. You do not need to worry about loud noise though, the patio outside is helpful and can alleviate any issues with inside noise. I never have noticed much of a noise factor though, its a fine spot to both watch a game and dine at. Its impressive how you can go about it at the 'Dillo.  ~Extras/Rating~ Call ahead for specials that day/week, the website they have does not get updated at all unfortunately. Look online, there are numerous coupons available from different spots... I use Entertainment coupons here and they work like a charm! They aren't the finest bar in town, that's understood. But its drink specials, above-par food, central location and outstanding staff each earn a star, giving them 4 overall stars. Much love for the 'Dillo, can't wait to go back and check in!",

    "text": "First time to Armadillo Grill and I was pleasantly surprised. Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).  I have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.  I think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!  Overall, I would definitely come back. I like the atmosphere, people, food and prices. Just wish it was closer to my house!",

I few cents extra but totally worth it.  The Mozzarella appetizer is fantastic too - 1/2 during happy hour. They freshly make these from scratch each time. The service is fantastic too. Normally I sit at the bar and order food and the bartenders have always been great.   It can be a little difficult to get to the parking lot from Camelback during rush hour, but it's not terrible.

    "text": "The server was off putting, but that always happens when you wear that much mascara.   The bf and I ate here after our hair person told us they had fried pickles.  We sat in rush over traffic after our day jobs and parked in a handicap spot in order to totally fuck with the system.  Actually, the paint was faded on the spot and we just couldn't tell either way.  We didn't get towed, but you might.  This place is bigger than you'd think and when we came in we were seating promptly by some chick whose probably a junior in high school and really proud of herself for working AND going to school AND doing yearbook AND trying out for the musical this year.   The reason this place is worth trying is because the happy hour, as far as happy hours goes, it's pretty fucking awesome.  Half price FULL size apps is alone worth the trip.  Since they were cheap, we ordered a shit load of stuff and tried to act like we had NO IDEA how much food we were ordering, but we did.  We got the calamari, the wings, the spinach and artichoke dip and the fried fucking pickles.  We also got some beer and some Long Islands and talked about why Waterworld ruined Kevin Constner's career.    The calamari was mediocre at best, mostly batter, but you know, it's calamari, what do you expect?  It wasn't horrible, it was edible and after two Long Island's not bad at all.  The wings were a bit cold and we ordered honey hot but got barbecue instead (I don't send shit back, I silently sulk and drink more), but overall they were okay, especially for the price.  The fried pickles were better than the ones you get at Lucille's but you have to be a fan of fried pickles to like them either way.  The star of our meal was definitely the spinach and artichoke dip especially since spinach and artichoke dip is some Chili's Applebee's Ultra American bullshit that usually tastes like kitten vomit.  This stuff was good though, a little spicy, creamy, not to clumpy and served in an 80's style bread bowl with tortilla chips and slices of bread that should have been toasted but weren't.    Our tab was about 50 bucks with a tip which wasn't so bad for how much food and booze we got.  I'm not giving it more stars for a few reasons.  1.  they fucked up our wing order 2.  it took us like a half hour to get our food and they brought ALL the apps out at once which seems retarded when you're just ordering apps. 3. it was fucking dark in there. 4. soooo much mascara.   Overall, I'd go back just for the dip and some drinks.  I'm pretty drunk right now actually, I could go for some fried pickles.",

You know what happens when you assume though...  Anyhow! It's very low key with great prices on drinks! Bar tenders are happy to give up suggestions when you're ready for something new. This is nice when you're as indecisive as myself.  They have loads of games besides pool. Darts, touch screen, etc. You will NOT be bored!

    "text": "I have been here quite a few times for happy hour. This place at first glance is very much a dive pub. Small TVs that need to be badly upgraded take up most of the wall space. The reason for this which you will figure out real quick once inside is that Armadillo Grill is an offsite track betting place as well.   75% of the TVs (during non-sporting events) will be focused on races across the country and you can go place a bet with a bookie up front as if you were at the track. Kinda cool...but betting on horses is not really my thing.   Drinks here are your typical bar drinks with a limited selection on happy hour but enough to find something. The Happy hour menu (munchies) has quite a few things on there which are good however the reason to come here are the \"Golden Delicious\" wings. These are what put this place on my radar....those wings are VERY good that it is hard to order anything else anytime I come here.   As far as non-happy hour....they have your typical pub cold and hot sandwiches like buffalo chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak. Nothing is too expensive, but the happy hour is where this place shines.   Give this place a shot if you are ever in the Biltmore area.",

    "text": "The food is great. The problem? The service we just encountered. We go here most Mondays for pool as part of date night. Sometimes we have a drink or two, sometimes not. Admittedly, lately it's mainly just a soda for my husband. But the time before that, I did have a drink or two.   We got there later than usual, and both pool tables were full. So we waited for one to open up and my husband ordered a soda.    The bartender tonight wasn't the one we normally have. And after we'd been sitting for about 15 minutes, he asked my husband, who was getting a refill of his root beer, whether we knew that there was a $5 minimum.   He said that the pool was for their guests. We couldn't just sit there, not buying anything (I guess a soda doesn't count -- I know it's not pricey, but there's a damn high profit margin) and \"just take up space.\" Seriously, that last part is verbatim.  Three things:   1. We weren't holding people up. If there had been a wait, we obviously wouldn't have lingered. When we got there, though, there were a few people at the bar, but at least 10-12 tables were empty. Probably more.   2. I had been considering getting a drink or two. And when I drink, I get the munchies. But I generally don't like to start drinking until we're playing a game.  3. We've been going there on Mondays for around 2 years now. This has never come up. Even a time or two that it was slammed during football games, while we played pool and my husband had a soda while I had a water. No one ever said anything even remotely approaching that.  I'm not saying I wouldn't necessarily understand a $5 minimum though, again, this is the first time I've heard of it. But you'd think an employee would be smart/well-trained enough to not use the words \"take up space\" in reference to the customer he's actually talking to.  Oh by the way, the bartender's remarks were especially funny after his comment when my husband got his root beer. He told the guy to leave it open, though he said that might be the only thing he'd be getting. So the bartender told him he could just pay now and still get refills. Because \"We're friendly here.\"",

I know now where I want to come when I want some wings or pickles, or any other tasty bar food. I would be safe to say that the wings I had at Armadillo Grill were some of the best in Phoenix (and I've had a lot of wings throughout the valley). But make sure to order the wings with Armadillo Gold Sauce, they were made to perfection.    Be sure to to have a nice beer and enjoy some games on one of the many screens.

    "text": "We were a group of five that came in around 7:00 on a Friday night. We were seated right away, drinks were ordered and received promptly. The drinks were a little on the strong side, but otherwise pretty good. We placed our food order and then proceeded to wait for nearly an hour before we received it. During that time our server rarely checked on us. She did state at one point our food would be out soon, but we continued to wait another 20 minutes after that statement. Twenty minutes is not soon to me. Once our food did finally arrive, my order was wrong. The server took my plate back immediately but then came back out a few minutes later with the same plate. She was under the impression that because two other people in our party had ordered the same item with different toppings, that our orders had been switched and placed in front of the wrong people. She actually had the gall to suggest I switch plates with another person in my group who had already started eating his food. Firstly, no, our orders had not been switched. Theirs were correct. Secondly, I was dumbfounded she would even suggest switching instead of just fixing the wrong order. She did end up taking it back and getting me a new sandwich. However, the quality of the food I did receive was mediocre, and I'm pretty sure they left the same side item on the plate, as it was ice cold. The other people in my group were pretty underwhelmed with their food as well though, in fairness, that might have just been because we waited so long for it. At the end of the meal, my item was taken off the bill. However, at no point did a manager ever stop by our table, nor did I even see one walking the floor. If they had, I honestly would not be writing this review. I worked in restaurants for 12 years in every conceivable position, and I don't like to put other restaurants on blast if I can help it. I'm sure others have had better experiences at this restaurant than we had, but I will definitely not be back.",

But, I ordered beef kebabs, basically shish kebab with onions and peppers, a bed of mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy that complimented it extremely well.   The meat was a decent quality and flavored nicely. The gravy and mashed potatoes probably were probably just processed ingredients but were good and had that sort of \"lazy mom's weeknight dinner\" recipe taste to it.  It was slightly underdone on a few pieces which I put to the side and didn't eat but it went together nicely. I was satisfied. I also had 2 drinks a margarita which wasn't great, and a seven and seven which tasted very weak.   The service was pretty great, every time we  walked up to the bar we had someone come up to us pretty fast.  Overall not a bad place and they have a nice patio.",

Our server was quick to answer any questions and also offered to swap fresh veggies in for cooked veggies as my side.  The kid's menu was a cut above the norm.

Whoever they've got in the kitchen is putting thought into the product and it shows.   The atmosphere is rad. It's one part bar, one part restaurant from a decade or two ago, and part OTB.

I prefer this place on a weekday. Sit at the bar, watch the TV, drink the specials and chat with the bartenders. Or, play darts on modern-day dart machines. It's comical to play Cricket in space, or with balloons. If that doesn't fancy you, play it straight. Or meander to the pool tables and hit some balls around. Or, if you need some fresh air, step outside on the patio... Most often you'll see a red/blue flashing light show. Fun times.   It's not the easiest place to find if you don't know what you're looking for. I think the large strip mall across the street distracts you while you're driving. But, turn your gaze to the north side of the street and look closely for this hidden gem. Stopping in for a drink or two is definitely well worth it.",

I ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.  Not sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!",

As a sports bar they have plenty of tv's and the game audio on which is nice.  There is not much good seating around the restaurant so eat at the bar if you can.    The food was just ok.  I had the Louisiana shrimp.  I don't know how they can call them Louisiana shrimp because everytime I've had BBQ shrimp in New Orleans they are good size shrimp.  These were tiny little shrimp drowned in sauce.  The sauce however was good and there is plenty of bread to scoop it up and eat it with.    They have several beer options which is nice and a full bar for mixed drinks and shots.    If you just are looking for a divish type bar to watch the game at with just decent food then this would be a good spot but there are many options of places like that I feel have way better food.   2.5/5",

I would have to say that I would like to give this place another ty on the food end of things.

How can you review a restaurant you didn't even eat at??? from your review you just walked in had a beer, peered down your nose and left.   This is a great little spot tucked away unsuspectingly on Camelback road. They have a great happy hour, pool tables and a surprisingly great menu. I haven't been here in awhile because of the economy the way that it is. But they did have off track betting as well . Not sure if they still do.  The service is good the people are fun and friendly. I like bar food but you can get so much more here.   Some of my Fav's  The herb crusted beef tenderloin is outstanding great cut of meat cooked to perfection.  The Mediterranean stuffed chicken stuffed with artichokes, black olives and feta with a dill sauce and wild rice it is delish!  I am not a big fan of Pesto but their Penne pesto cream is yummy.  Also try the Thai Chicken skewers, Artichoke Croquettes, Louisiana Shrimp, or the Cracked Black pepper Calamari!   This is a restaurant/bar! It's a joint, a neighborhood hang out.   I hate to be rude but geez, you stick to your hood and I'll stick to mine.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and prompt with our drinks.   We ordered:  *Wings in Armadillo Gold Sauce- Nico loved them  *Potato Skins- soooo good! Some of the best skins I've ever had  *Hummus and Pita bread- also v good. Pita was warm and toasted perfectly   There were a lot of sports fans glued to the Chargers game and it was a fun atmosphere.

I will first say that the food was absolutely delicious and would bring me back, we had the fried pickles as an appetizer, they were very good , I recommend getting half cajun style and half original. For dinner I had the buffalo chicken burger, if you like buffalo chicken get this it was delicious to the end with its brioche bun. My friend got the fish tacos which was a huge serving but she thoroughly enjoyed. My conclusion on their food was big portions (I would share next time unless you want leftovers), delicious, and there was a good variety on the menu. As far as the service is concerned (I will first say that I myself am a server so I have taken into account quite a few things),our server took forever to come to get our order and when she finally did she just got the drink order then proceed to run around her section without our drinks for at least five minutes ( we all got beer so should have been fairly quick), then after she dropped those off even though we had our menus stacked to indicate readiness she left and did not return for about 10 minutes. Might I add that it was happy hour when we got there but since she did not take our full order for about 15 minutes we did not get to take advantage of it because the computers switch over automatically. Not to mention she had to keep running back and forth to ask questions, I get it there is a lot to memorize but their menu is fairly small and if you work happy hour you definitely need to know your drink menu. All in all I would return but don't go starving because it may be a while. Delicious food, average service.",

A friend insisted I try their famous fried pickles so I did. They were okay, but I mean, it was just a hot claussen covered in breading. Mmm. But hey, if I was hammered, I'm sure I would have been all about it. Another gut-bomb appetizer I indulged in was the fried mozzarella. No explanation needed there. The hummus was better than I expected, though. So were the wings... With both sauces. And no this was not a 1am tuesday binge session. I don't do that anymore.  Good drink specials.

We had the fried pickles, eh...the Cajun spices pepped them up a little but nothing special. They were in spears so a little harder to eat than chips. Calamari was delicious. Perfectly cooked, sauce was great. Ceaser salad was decent. Server told me they were known for their soup so i tried it and it was very good but nothing to it. I had the special chicken cordon bleu with jalapeno cream sauce. I found the flavors really didn't jibe. Thin chicken breast, ham, Swiss and then drowned in this sauce. Maybe a mustard sauce would be better? Mashed potatoes were bland and the broccoli was bland. The chicken with the mushroom sauce was better. The little guy had chicken strips but were actually overcooked, mostly breaded chicken chunks. He ate all the fruit though. They were out of the brownie so we opted to share the black forest cheesecake which was good but the sauce had marachino cherries on it. You know? The bar cherries. The prices were reasonable and the service was  bomb. This menu needs some help....",

Apparently, you get 1 topping of your choice with the philly cheesesteak sandwich and then you can get additional peppers, mushrooms or whatever for a dollar a piece.  Seriously??!

Not only that, but they also ran out chicken. They were also down a cook which I understand, but they did not tell us that before sitting us. We overheard it from the table behind us. It would have been courteous to mention it before so we could know that we would wait a while or even go someplace else. We received our food which  some of the plates were cold. After all of this we received the bill and there was no discount for the wait or food being cold (which was mentioned). We asked the waitress (she was very nice!) if we could get a discount and she said that she had asked her manager before bringing the check to us. She then said she would go and ask again, which then the manager gave us the discount. This is where I thought it was ridiculous! The manager knew we had waited so long because he had come over a few times apologizing for the wait. I will not be coming here again and recommend to spend your money elsewhere!",

My friend's sweet potato fries came out burnt, like real burnt, crispy all the way through the fry. Another friend ordered fish tacos, they were out of batter for the fish fry. Another friend ordered wings, over cooked and burnt. My wings were good, but I ordered the Armadillo Gold(which I highly recommend by the way) but I was given Buffalo wings. This normally isn't a problem for me so I just nicely brought it up to my waitress, but she told me that it was the right flavor and I could never get my Armadillo Gold wings. I really big let down especially when I was looking forward to them all day. Overall the entire experience was a let down, and I'm disappointed because I know the restaurant was a lot better in the past.",

Amy was our waitress and she was phenomenal, she knew when to come around and ask us if we needed help or knew when to leave us to our football games. The best part is that they were very accommodating with the Tv's. I hate hate hate going to BWW's and having to fend for myself in a ring of other football fans. This place was small and had more than enough TV's to fit any fan, they best part is that none of them were connected to another Tv meaning if we changed one TV it wouldn't change someone else's game.  I have to say the the selection of food is okay, I wish they had more variety of food. It's the typical wings, burgers, and appetizers....I guess that's all you need for a sports bar...lol but if I could want to change something it would be to add more variety: more salad choices, maybe fruit trays?, or more desserts!!!   The drinks were the regular requests you may want at any typical bar: margaritas, well drinks, and draft beers. I can't complain too much about this bar because how well their service and professionalism was. I would definitely go here again :)",

It's like walking into your degenerate uncles apartment to watch sports and horses and listen to gold laden dudes complain about who is better, The Great Brett Favre or That Punk Aaron Rodgers. The food was decent for bar food and the beers were really cheap. That's a huge plus but if you're looking for a good place to watch sports with like minded individuals you might as well keep going. Although I do think you should give it a shot because this might be a good place to make some wagers and walk with some side cash.",

    "text": "My business partner and I love getting wings for lunch. That hunt for great wings led us to Armadillo Grill and has now turned into a weekly occurrence. I still have a place or two in Central Phx that I haven't tried (yet), but Armadillo Grill has hit the best wings in town, IMO. Yes, they are that good. What's even better is they are half price on \"Wing Wednesday\"! I strongly recommend the Armadillo Gold (Medium spicy), followed by the Honey Hot (Mild). Great seasoning on the wings, amazing sauce. Even their Buffalo (hot) is tasty - I just like the Armadillo Gold too much to venture away from it very often.  I have NEVER had a rude experience with the staff. Minimal issues with service or food, that were always fixed right away and with a smile.   As for the atmosphere, you just have to know what you are walking into, and the place is great. What it is NOT: Chic, Upscale, Pretentious. What it IS: Really good food, down to earth, and no frills. It's not a \"Dive\", but it's not Twin Peaks, Buffalo Wild Wings, or Zipps either. It has an OTB (Off Track Betting) so finding half a dozen guys betting the ponies is to be expected. It's a \"Bar and Grill\" - not the worst place for a family, but if you bring kids, make sure you sit in the \"restaurant\" area, not at the tables within ear shot of the bar (that seems kind of logical though).  Thank you Brenda for giving us our regular \"Wing Wednesday\" hang-out!",

The fried pickles not the sliced kind you get at Hooters- these are fried whole, and they are worth the trip.  Vibe here is a little dive-ish, and there was a mix of families in the section furthest from the bar, off-track betters & Phoenix hipsters at the bar, and plenty of non-descript folks here on the Friday night I attended. I'm a big fan of a mixed crowd, so I'm also a big fan of Armadillo.",

Last Friday we ordered and when my sandwich was delivered i  couldn't wait to take a bite.  i was so dissapointed when i bit into the sandwich the the chicken was dry and charred. It had been cooked for so long the all tbe brie had melted off the sandwich leaving just  the empty white cheese Rhine. It was dry and terrible. I took two bites and gave up.  the only reason that I gave two stars was because i got a side of onion rings which are always great. If it were not for the onion rings, I would have went hungry .  I'm really bummed and don't know if Iwill even attempt to order my favorite sandwich again for fear  it will be horrible once again. :-(",

Now magnify it to be as big as your face. Yeah, that's basically what the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is! I wish I could put emoji's in my review because dipped in ranch this sandwich is a mouthful of all things that you need when you're watching sports: a large amount of breaded meat doused in cheese, slapped with a few vegetables and ready for sauce dipping and consumption. The onion rings were equally as large and in charge. For the record, I did not eat the entire thing in one sitting, and even a normal sized guy with a large stomach will have to throw down on this Man vs. Food sized sandwich. You've been warned.",

It's all the way in the back of the restaurant, so we had to go thru the bar and restaurant and to the room.  I thought we would be forgotten, but we weren't.  Our server, Jordan was very attentive to us--kept our iced tea glasses full and took our order when we all knew what we wanted for lunch.  It's bar food--get a burger and a beer.  Don't expect anything gourmet, because gourmet it's not.  I had the Greek salad with blackened chicken.  It was OK, but my expectations weren't high.  All in all, it's a great bar (but I quit drinking a few years ago, so I'm not into bars).  I wouldn't choose this place, but the person in charge of our group likes it so that's why we were there.  Really no complaints, just not my style.",

Tomato soup is creamy and wonderful, shrimp tacos are great and with pretty large shrimp, and the fried cheese, OMG. There must have been a pound of cheese. Think heart attack on a plate, but I survived. They coat this cheese in panko and it is just amazing!!

The servers are super friendly and know their shi....stuff :) Virginia and Amy are awesome.   Tomato soup - hands down the BEST I have ever had. Slightly sweet and very creamy. WOW. Serious mouthgasm.   Smothered chicken - excellent gravy. I have had this one more times than I can count. Corn can be a little dry but you can always substitute a different side.   Fried pickles - these are spears, not slices, but the breading has great flavor and is very crisp.   Quesadillas and burgers are good, fairly standard but still tasty.   All of their pastas are excellent. Can't go wrong here.   Was not a fan of the meatloaf sandwich but the actual meatloaf dinner is well done. This sandwich is the only thing I ever ordered here that left me at all disappointed and I've probably stuffed my face with 3/4 of the stuff on the menu by now.   Overall, their food has a home cooked, fresh flavor. Nothing tastes likes a tv dinner and for a sports bar, it goes above and beyond what I would expect for food.   Love you Dillo, see you soon!",

My favorite was the Jolly Rancher. Really does taste like a Jolly Rancher. A very cute, girly, pink drink! Also got a Bloody Mary type martini and sent it back because I really did not like it. I think I just prefer to keep my martinis fruity, just my personal taste. Also got a cosmo and it was really strong. Not too bad though, I liked it. My boyfriend got some beers and loved his food as well.   The ambiance of Armadillo Grill is nice as well. Usually do not like places with a ton of TVs and sports playing and whatnot, but I did like it here. Can't wait to give this a second try!",

    "text": "Saturday lunch at Armadillo. We've seen this place for years but never stopped before. We were in the neighborhood this time and decided to give it a try. I do not know what is that I was expecting, but this was not it. It was good, though. It is kind of tiny, it is more of a bar... And, oh my, they had something like incense burning or some odd smell... not for me : ( We sat by a corner and Mike was our server. He was outstanding. He asked if we had been there before and gave us some history and recommendations. He was very friendly and approachable.  Well, we like it when a place has a signature dish, and for Armadillo Grill it seems to be fried pickles. Not my proudest moment, truth be told, but they were actually good : P We had half regular, half Cajun. I liked them both but I liked the ranch best.  We ended up ordering the Thai Chicken skewers and the Louisiana meatball sandwich. I just tasted them both as I was not very hungry, I thought they were a good and hubby liked them very much. He said the chicken skewers were very tasty even without the sauce.  I only had water, hubby had diet coke. Next time I will have a beer : )",

They had the misters going on the semi-enclosed patio and it must not have been too bad as other seemed to be enjoying it. Although we are not into it, they have OTB. Watched the DBacks game instead.

What can't I say about The Dillo? I've heard about this place for years and have only within the last year or so been in to take it for a test run to see how great (or bad) it could be. It's lived up to the hype.  The Armadillo Grill is misleading. From the outside, it isn't what you would expect. It's a sports bar with class and the food is awesome. My favorite? The fried pickles...such a guilty pleasure but I eat them with ease. The wings are also fantastic and so's the calamari.  The wait-staff are all friendly...every single person I've been served by has been attentive, friendly without being over bearing and sometimes, a big ol' smart ass (specifically Jason the bartender) which is right up my alley.   Any place that has reverse happy hour is a winner in my book seeing as I work late most of the time and rarely get to make that 4-7 slot many places have. And the happy hour is fantastic!   Even when I move closer to downtown, I'll still make my trip up to stop in at The Dillo....you should too!",

Great place to watch games and not get your typical bar food. They would get 5 stars if they had better service. Nothing terrible, but have to wait awhile sometimes.",

    "text": "So... I am a little biased, being that I am a former \"Dillo\" AND I met my future husband here.  That being said, I love this place.  The staff is efficient, very friendly and a lot of fun.  The \"Dillo is a neighborhood bar and grill in the Camelback Corridor with a great menu.  They serve your typical bar food, yet better... usually with their own special spin on it.  They also have a very creative lunch and dinner menu and a specials menu that changes weekly to keep you on your toes.    The wings are awesome!  They marinate in a spicy dry rub before frying and the sauce selections are very tasty and all homemade.  My personal favorite was the traditional buffalo sauce but the Armadillo Gold sauce is also very good.  Although it is a tough call, the Hummus & Pita is probably my favorite appetizer.  It is topped with ground cumin and smoked paprika that gives it wonderful flavor.  The best part about the wings, hummus and the rest of the \"Munchie Menu\" is that is is half price between 4-7p AND 11p-close EVERYDAY!  Some of my other favorite menu items are the Buffalo Chicken sandwich (YUM!) and Seared Ahi Tuna salad.  The Penne Pesto Cream is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes EVER.    I can't leave a review with out mentioning the drink specials... Hello drink specials!!  Happy Hour everyday from 4-7 & 11-cl, that means $1 off all well drinks, draft and bottle beers.  Three Olives vodka specials on Mondays and Thursdays ($3.50 or $5 doubles, yum!).  There are many other drink specials you must check out for yourself.  I think I have rambled on enough about my love of the dillo, I moved away and just miss this wonderful little place!",

    "text": "My boyfriend (the lucky Nader A.) and I were driving past, feeling hungry and irritable late at night. We went and it looked like a standard sports bar--not the kind of place I'd usually go to, but it was late and our options were limited.  We sat down in a dimly lit booth and looked skeptically at the menu. We decided to go with the Fried Pickles, the Fingers and Fries, and the Buffalo Chicken Burger. I expected standard greasy bar food, but Holy Jesus, it was AMAZING! The fried pickles are huge and the batter is wonderful. I'll eat 3 of them (they come in orders of 6) and start feeling full. The Fingers and Fries are also great, the chicken is some of the most tender I've ever had. You can very gently pull it apart with your fingers. Absolute bliss. I think they use corn flakes or something in the batter; it's very flavorful and thick. I usually get the Fingers and Fries with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch.  The Macaroni and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken is also worth stopping in for. I always have an internal battle about whether I want that or the Fingers and Fries. The waitresses are always friendly and the place isn't usually too busy. I tried branching out for the enchiladas and wasn't very impressed, but that's fine--I'll stick to what's good.   I'm here pretty regularly whenever I feel like throwing my diet to the wind...which happens at least once a week because of those damn fried pickles!",

The Happy hour is a great deal.They have half price munchies and $3 well drinks.

For dinner I had the bar b que pulled pork sandwich and my fiance had the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were really delicious!!  The atmosphere is fun because you can tell this is the kind of place that has \"regulars\" and where the locals hang out. Not to mention there is a TV practically every 3 feet with some sort of sport on it.   We occasionally go to Turf Paradise but with Armadillo Grill so close maybe will start coming here to do a little off track betting.

The food here is what really keeps me coming back... and really only when it's on special.

I had a bloody mary that was not very flavorful, and some calamari that was also very bland. But, it was an OK experience, and the service was friendly, so we decided to go back for lunch. This time, we sat inside. The walls are lined with TVs showing stats on all the horse races. I think we were the only ones here NOT betting on the races. It was OK, just a little weird and it felt like a really lonely dark dungeon. I had the shrimp scampi for lunch and it was actually delicious! Their Armadillo Ale isn't bad either. I also like that they have daily specials on food and drinks.  I would come here again but probably not during the afternoon since the atmosphere is kind of depressing, but for a few evening drinks, the Armadillo grill is a good choice.",

Our rotation of munchies includes potato skins (sans bacon), hummus, wings, fried mozzarella, and ALWAYS fried pickles. Their fried pickles are soooo good. If you like pickles and fried food, you will LOVE their fried pickles.  Large drafts and wells are reasonably priced. Their bloody marys are probably my favorite in the valley. Ask for a cajun rim!

I started going here when I moved into the area, and now I don't mind going anytime of the day! The day bartenders are always super friendly, as are the night bartenders. The food is delicious regardless of when you order it- my favorites are the fried pickles (frickles) and the buffalo mac n' cheese.   If you work in the 16th street area, don't forget to write the name of your establishment on your check so that you can be king of camelback!  Go Aunt Chialda's! ;-)  Love you Dillo!",

I think everyone should have a pub. It's like a living room away from home. The Armadillo has the requisite multiple TV's,, happy hour specials, pool tables, and an interesting assortment of Runyonesque characters who come and go. It's the closest thing to a dive you'll find in that section of the Camelback Corridor, and I mean that in the best and most enthusiastic sense. I love dives.  The munchies menu (discounted during happy hours and all-day Monday) includes several appetizers, including fried pickles, a very decorative hummus plate, and some of the best wings in the valley (try the Armadillo or Honey-Hot). Drink prices are good, and they have specials like \"PBR power hour\" (one dollar Pabst Blue Ribbon beers for you culturally-impoverished sorts).  Again, hard for me to objective, but it' a definite favorite that I would recommend to anyone.",

My boyfriend and I started out with fried pickles, and they're some of the best I've had. The fried pickles come in two different flavors, original and Cajun; we got half and half. The pickles are spears, rather than chips.  For dinner I had the Grilled Cheese with soup; I could eat this every day it was so good. It was made with two types of cheese on sour dough bread, and they have a different soup every week.  I give the food a 10, but the service was poor. I'm a server, so I know what the restaurant business is like. My boyfriend never got offered another beer, and I didn't get a refill on my soda until I was finished. I rarely saw my server, but she mentioned they had a groupon ending that day so that would explain her lack of attention. Although, the place didn't seem busy to me.  Overall, I will be a returning customer. I have already recommended this place multiply times.",

    "text": "Fried pickles in phoenix?  Okay, so they are not the same as the fried pickles at Julians in Providence.  but they are actually quite good.  We like 'em with the cajun seasoning and the buffalo sauce for dipping.  Ooh so good and hot!    They have beer.  They have lots of beer and will keep it coming.  Beware of the tall beers.  They have  way of sneaking up on you.    Their burgers are great.  They use high quality beef when making them.  I enjoy a burger where I feel like I don't need it covered in cheese to enjoy the flavor.  I don't especially like cheese on a burger but will order it when I think a place is going to be mediocre so that it covers up the flavor.  Their burgers are served on a brioche that is not buttered (yay!).    I also enjoy their pulled pork sandwich.    For their sides:  The steak fries are yummy here if you're feeling decadent.  their onion rings are really, really yummy if you're feeling extra decadent.  their salad is really good and comes with a vast assortment of unique dressings.    Now the downside.  If you got on a Friday or Saturday night then don't expect to be able to carry on a conversation with your friends.  The music is LOUD and inside it is virtually impossible to carry on a conversation unless you're yelling.    Most other times this is just a great place to come hang out, have some beers with friends with no attitudes.  Great, friendly service.  The manager on duty is always around.",

And that sums up my experience.  Service had a rocky start...my friend started a tab before I got there and I sat for 15 min waiting for a server before I went to the bar.  Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.  We had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.  Pretty standard stuff.    Overall, I'll go back for some HH specials but I'm not going to be the one suggesting it to people.  I'll stay up by 16th and Bethany Home instead.",

We ordered the cajun style and man oh man were they goooooood! We have never even heard of them but I am so glad we got them. So crispy and so hot! Mmmmm (and 1/2 priced)!!!  We got greeted and seated quickly. I ordered the chicken brie sandwhich and my husband had the meatloaf sandwhich. I am not sure where the comment about small portions came from because they were good sized and we were both stuffed!  The only change to the chicken brie would be to have the pears sliced thinner rather than having thick pears to bite through. Otherwise it was yummy.  I also ordered the \"Arizona Iced Tea\" for the first time since they didn't have fresh mint to make my mojito. I was pleasantly surprised at how light and refreshing it was.  We had the entertainment card which they didn't punch so we can use it again, and we will :)",

Unfortunately we arrived half way through round one so we didn't have much of a chance of winning.   I ordered a vanilla porter on tap from the Breckenridge Brewery and it was phenomenal. If you come here to eat and you like dark beer, you absolutely must try this.  The waiter, whose name was JW, made the overall dining experience a total blast. He anticipated our every wish and was very entertaining as he made our dining experience memorable!  So, we actually went for the food because we were starving. Two of the group ordered the chicken and Brie sandwich, which was very tasty (according to those who ate it), and two of us ordered the sriracha burger, which was scrumptious. The jalapeno peppers gave the burger the added oomph to render it sublimely tasty as well as spicy.  The sports bar has something for everyone, including two happy hours every day, a pool table, a couple of video game machines, a full bar, outdoor seating, free parking, incredible food and marvelous service. What more could you want? Definitely worth every dollar we spent and earns a solid 5 stars.",

The sandwich is filling so Asian slaw as the side was perfect. If you are a big, big eater, you might want the fries. According to others in my party, they were great. 2. A hilarious, attentive waiter. He provided great service and made the meal a truly memorable experience. 3. Trivia night. Who can resist playing?

They have Trivia nights, horse race betting and several TV's going to keep you entertained. Don't be deceived by calling themselves a sports grill. Their food is some of the best in the area.

This is a fun place with an apparently great crowd! There's also a couple pool tables and an arcade corner. I can see this place coming alive at night!

Their burger is pretty tasty too. It's bar food that won't disappoint. One time we did not order ahead of time and waited at the bar for our food. Luckily it was happy hour and had a couple of drinks at the bar with some appetizers. Ordered mozzarella sticks and Calamari. The calamari and wedge salad (we ordered on a previous trip) was unmemorable and wouldn't order again. The mozzarella sticks were delicious and not just your average mozzarella sticks that you normally get. Our bartender was friendly and would definitely come again.",

The location is convenient -- right on Camelback near the Colonnade area and the 51 (and a bias factor: it's in my neck of the woods). The place does not look big from the outside but once you enter, you'll find a spacious dining area which includes comfortable booths as well as standard bar seating. The food is really good, affordably priced, and the choices include many comfort food favorites. There are the usual big screens showing sports programs which is a plus if you are a sports enthusiast but none are loud enough to detract from comfortable conversation with your dining companions. And last but not least, they are open till 2 AM, which means my friends and I can enjoy a substantial meal when hunger pangs hit after a late night out.",

Do not be deceived by its rough and tumble exterior (PS tons of parking in the back). When you walk in you say \"oh, sports bar. Food will be fair and we will be on the road\". Well my friends, on the contrary, you just hit the jackpot. We had pasta, quesadillas, fried chicken, spinach artichoke dip, mozzarella sticks and craft beer. All the food and sauces are scratch made and will not disappoint. It taste like somebody's momma is in the kitchen. How many times have you had mozzarella sticks and said \"Why do I get these\" With theirs you say \"Why doesn't everybody learn to hand make theirs like this\".  Very savvy and personable server (from Plattsburgh, NY and a friendly stop by from the manager/owner. GO THERE! There are few sure bets in this life. This is one of them.",

Super awesome prices and some super awesome food. My favorite is hands down the armadillo gold sauce. It's so perfectly sweet and savory and spicy- I think about it toooooo much. I get it tossed with the chicken tenders and it comes with a side of fries. So good!   This place also has some really awesome happy hour! Happy hour runs til 7pm and they have some really good deals on apps and drinks. I would recommend the fried pickles (Cajun and regular).  ALSO, They have a reverse happy hour again from 10pm to 2am... how have I not taken advantage of this???   Seriously folks, take a chance on the armadillo grill.",

I love their chicken wings and they have some other decent finger foods. I really only go for the apps, I feel that's where sports bars tend to shine the most. The only complaint is the beer taste off. It's probably improper tap line cleaning or possibly the co2 is off. It's one of my very few pet peeves and The Dillo isn't the only place guilty of it. If you're going to have the state flagship beer on tap then it needs to taste right. I'd give it 3.5 for sports bars. Decent prices and decent music being pumped out. Half Moon has some better deals on happy hour but good lord I can't stand the ambiance. Dillo is a decent priced neighborhood bar.",

So for me, on the one hand having to be around the knuckle heads who want to waste vast amounts of time and money on which horse can run fastest is a negative. The dark and dingy interior doesn't help either.    But on the other hand, the food is certainly a cut above the typical greasy, soggy bar food one usually encounters at most sports bars for a decent price. If you're there to watch a whole football game like I would on a few occasions you could end up spending in the mid to high 20's when it's done, but if you're just there to get a meal and maybe a beer, then obviously you won't end up spending as much like around $15. The bartenders are overall ok. No real issue there.  Overall it's more of an interesting experience than a pleasant experience, which is why I will pop in from time to time, but only from time to time just to mix it up.  Oh yeah, and to their credit (at least in my book) they play metal later in the night when all the games are over and there's no more retarded horse racing on.",

In February, my boyfriend ordered a burger with an English muffin bun and there was mold on it. We came here on St. Patrick's Day for their special menu and waited an hour and a half for our food. It wasn't very busy so we figured they were short staffed or something. The server didn't give us any explanation until after we were completely finished with dinner. Apparently one of their fryers had gone out so there was only one that could be used. That would have been a fine excuse if only we hadn't ordered Shepherd's Pie and Corned Beef & Cabbage (both were delish!), which had nothing that needed to be deep fried. I wouldn't have been mad about the wait if wasn't 8:30 by the time we got our food and I didn't have to get up at 4 in the morning. The third star is for server/manager Katie because she deserves her own..",

Love that even on the special prices for cocktails you still get a fairly decent pour.  The patio is great at night for watching all the crazy drivers on Camelback.  Service is always pretty good, and the managers are always roaming about helping aid in good service.  They have pool tables and tons of TVs.  I've only had one thing here that I didn't like, and that was just a personal preference thing (their nachos are with the cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese) The 1/2 price munchie menu for late night is awesome.  I have a love affair with their Hummus....soooo good!!  Definitely a place to check out for sure!",

For $13.99 you can't go wrong  I could not finish my meal.  The wait staff was all very nice and knowledgeable about the drink list and the menu. It has a little something for everyone.  You can sit at the bar , in the sports area or the back room which is a little quieter but still has big screen TV's.  I can't wait to go back! Oh and on Monday's, Happy Hour is ALL DAY!  See you again soon Dillo Oh and the sign is so small it's easy to pass by this place but they're revamping the sign so that it will be larger and easier to spot!  In the meantime just be on the lookout for a small green sign with the name of the place. It's definitely worth the trip.",

The inside is a bit dark for me, but the multitude of TV's makes up for it. I was looking for something substantial to fill me up and it was recommended I try their hamburger steak. The meat was 'ok' but the gravy was outstanding. That's a good thing because the side of mashed potatoes were plain. Perhaps we're all spoiled nowadays because all establishments seem to offer blended options. The broccoli was under cooked. The food wasn't bad, but there just wasn't enough there to make me a repeat customer.",

They have a good amount of drink specials that vary by day of the week and a cocktail garnished with a rubber duck, which is cute.  I came for trivia and had a pretty average burger. I heard better things about the mozzarella triangles and the chicken strips friends ordered. The portions were big but I felt that for the cost, there are other places I'd rather be.  Service was on the good side of average, and the waiter nicely split the bill several ways for our large group. However, their card reader was down for a while near the end, which caused inconvenience about paying with cash. I could be persuaded to return for trivia but I wouldn't choose to come back just for the food.",

This place has a cool vibe, nice people and great food.  My hubby had the Beef Stroganoff.  Overall, he was pleased, but he said there should have been more mushrooms and less onion which were cut into huge chunks and over-powered the flavor a little.  I had the Eclectic mac & cheese which was really yummy and I enjoyed it.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because for a Monday night with a near empty dining room the service was VERY slow- but we would definitely go there again the next time we are in town.",

We got here and were greeted and seated right away. Our server named Virginia was nothing short of spectacular. She was attentive and helpful. She recommended the same items I came to try. Fish and chips and Beef stroganoff. The patrons were so nice and made the experience even better. Now I understand the comments from my wife. The fish and chips was fresh and hot, crispy and delicious. The beef stroganoff was amazing. It tasted homemade. Will definitely come back when in town.  I had read some of the other reviews and the bad reviews of the same dishes we had. I understand that even with the best places they have an off day, but I think those reviews were WAY off. They must be off their meds. Can't wait to try it again when I get back in town",

The table was super sticky and off-putting to boot and we were told that that is how they all are. Umm..how about sanding them down? It just felt like someone had spilled soda all over it and never cleaned it up.  Gross.  I ordered the chicken parm and the breaded chicken was soft and mushy.  Bad choice. Also, was offered garlic bread, which was not worth the extra buck, since it seriously lacked having much of a garlic flavor at all.  But wait, when I asked if I could have some parmesan cheese on the top of my entree, i was told that it would cost an extra .75! Are u kidding me? It has nothing to do with cooking up quality and having this offset in the price. My dish was straight up mush. I didn't even want to take it to go once i stopped eating it.   If you're going to serve Italian dishes and charge for what would typically be a part of the pasta dish, don't try to justify the extra charges. You just look stingy. Next time I will go somewhere else for pasta as I'm sure others have done as well.",

    "text": "Love this place!  The tomato soup/ grilled cheese combo is delicious, the pasta is very tasty,  the burgers are fabulous. The house merlot is perfect, not too heavy, and very yummy. The iced tea is generous and refershing, and they make a great black and tan. If they would make the fried pickles as discs,  I think they would be better,  but they're good as is,  too. Today i had the spinach artichoke dip. It comes with addictive, crispy pita bread and great tortilla chips. The dip itself is spicy with jalapeno,  but not too much so (says the girl from Michigan).  It tasted like someone here at Armadillo Grill made it. The appetizer comes with a small portion of chunky, tasty salsa. Yum!  I'm not sure you can go wrong here,  but trust me, do try the tomato soup.  Seriously stellar!!",

    "text": "Oh, Armadillo Grill...you are something special.  The first time I came here it was late at night and I wasn't expecting much at all. From the outside this bar didn't really look like my style, but the moment I stepped inside, I was confused. It's had a semi-dive feel and there were a couple of really good DJs that night. I began to think that this place was going to be an alright spot to eat late at night. Then I had the food...  Two words: Fried Pickles. I've had them before at other places but Armadillo serves the best I've ever had. They were mind-boggling good! Not only were they like delicious sin in my mouth, they were also on a happy hour menu! $3.50 for an order of six! After the pickle came the chicken and I can say with confidence that it's the best chicken I've had at a bar. It doesn't matter if you get the strips or the buffalo chicken sandwich, they are both mouthwatering (writing about it right now is making me hungry). That night I left really content and sure that I would be back, and not just late at night!  Once I returned I knew I should try a few other things but I'm always compelled to get the chicken. I did manage to taste the mac and cheese (with buffalo chicken!), their wings and the chicken parm. Everything was spectacular (especially as far as pubs go)!  The staff at Armadillo Grill has always been great and I'm sure they will continue to be as I wiggle my way into becoming a regular here! Great happy hour, great food and friendly service in a really chill bar equals two huge thumbs up from me (I jammed them so they're both swollen)!",

    "text": "Bottom line: Great food. Decor could use some help, and the TV's were a bit small to be a sports bar. Food was affordable, and portions were large.  Drinks were as expected, nothing good or bad about it. I had Kiltlifter, my friends had sodas and iced teas.  We ordered some buffalo and honey bbq wings, as well as some calamari. First, the wings were huge, which was good because we only got about 8 for the 1lb order. But they were very well done, and the flavor was not added on post cooking, as most average establishments do. No, the flavor was baked in.   The calamari was not rubbery, but had a good snap, which means it was well cooked and of good quality. The breading wasn't overboard, and had a nice crunch to it. Very well done.  For the entrees, we had the Beef Stroganoff, the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, and I ordered the Mac and Cheese with the Buffalo chicken upgrade.  First, my Mac and Cheese. It definitely wasn't box mac. It had a few cheeses that were  blended and mixed in with penne, and the dollar upgrade of buffalo chicken was a heapful of chicken on top. It came together very well, and tasted great. Well worth it, and the extra for Buffalo chicken. Portion size was also good.  The Beef Stroganoff was well done according to my friend, and it looked huge. Comfort foods should always be generous portions and have a nice home cooked feel to it in order to be successful. They were.  And the Buffalo Chicken sandwich? My friend said it was the biggest one he'd ever gotten. It looked it. And he enjoyed it. So there's that. It didn't look too extravagant, but then it shouldn't be. It just looked big and tasty.  So why four stars? First, the decor was fairly outdated. It looked kind of like a neighborhood bar, but facing Camelback, and being so close to the Biltmore, I really thought they could use an upgrade. The TV's were at best 30's and the audio was low. A sports bar usually has at least a few 50's and pump out the sound for the major games.   But, all this could be why their prices are affordable (just go to Biltmore instead, and overpay for the ambiance), and their food is certainly good enough to keep people coming back. In fact, writing this review, I believe I shall go there again tonight.",

Further, on a night of NBA playoffs, 90% of the 'TVs' have off-track betting on them instead of sports!! Weird.  Good service at bar. Jimmy is good. But must be forced by mgmt to use a jigger to pour drinks, which is a bit unexpected in a dive bar like this.  Fried cajun pickles are just ok. Kind of tasteless and underdone.  They're using a cheap pickle I think.  This is mainly an off-track betting bar.",

A 5oz. filet of salmon, seared medium, served over field greens and soba noodles in a soy balsamic vinaigrette.  Herb Crusted Beef Tenderloin $19.

I met my love here for a quick happy hour before we headed out for dinner with friends. A pre-game before the real game , if you will. My expectations weren't that high, but that is okay. My boyfriend loves a good divey bar that is not so trendy and yuppie, as he puts it. This to me was just nice and surprising. The bar staff was super friendly. The beer on tap was nice and cold. Peach Ale from 4Peaks is always a win-win for me! 4Peaks Kiltlifter on tap for him. Off track betting on the tele. Pool tables around the place. For 345pm in the afternoon, it was already packed! We didn't want to mess our appetites up, so we only opted for the fried pickles and went half regular and half cajun spicy. YUMMY! Besides, on happy hour they are $3.50; one of the best happy hour menu pricings around and that is important! I loved being happy when I think I may end up turning my nose up at something.. Just goes to show: Listen to Yelp!",

We ordered 2 orders of buffalo wings with Armadillo Gold sauce, potato skins, hummus and fried pickles. The wings were delicious, finger tasting good! Except I didn't care for the red onions tossed on top of the wings, easily picked off, but none the less weird! I have never had a buffalo wing served with raw onions, and i'm not about to start (next time i'll ask them to leave them off-i hate to waste food=even if its just a few diced onions). The fried pickles had a delicious breading so i didn't mind that they weren't the True dill pickles i'm used too. The ranch for the pickles was a little runny, but tasty. The potato skins were also very tasty, and best part is there was little to no grease on top because I asked them to leave the bacon off. They were cooked to precision, not dry or over baked what so ever! They sure do know how to served a good drink too. The service was good, we didn't have to wait long for anything. There were a lot of of men due to the off track betting, so you can imagine the lack of women hanging out just for the fun of it. Something about old men smoking cigarettes non-stop checking out the race sheets and pissed of about dropping money in a second keeps women away, but don't let that keep you from trying this place, especially for the Happy Hour!",

    "text": "Went to Armadillo Grill today because of the 4 stars out of 158 reviews. Our waitress gave us wrong information about the ingredients for my meal twice (I'm vegan and specifically asked if the veggie burger had milk or egg, then I asked for the street tacos with a substitute of avacado and black beans and after saying that was fine she came back and said no the black beans where only for the veggie burger and I could only have avocado on it.) So I told her to forget it and to bring our appetizer the hummus and pita bread and my boyfriends order of beef street tacos. His order came first before the appetizer. She blamed this one someone in the kitchen. She did not provide utensils or napkins and she did not bring him the refried beans and rice that came with the order. We didn't mention it and just asked for the the utensils and napkins.  My boyfriend said taco bell had better tacos than here. There hummus was nothing special however the pita bread was very fluffy and delicous.  She then came by and asked me if she could get me a brownie or something for all the trouble. ( previously I let her know I do not eat milk or eggs because I am vegan, thought that was a bit of a sick joke. ) I just ignored that and said I'm sure that has milk in it and she laughed and said that was a rhetorical question.  Yea I found that ironic given her lack of waitress skills.  Then the check came. It was the wrong check charged for 2 full street taco meals and hummus with an additional charge of olives which I don't know where that came from. I brought it to her attention that I believe the order was incorrect she again blamed someone in the kitchen for the error again.  I won't be coming back. Oh not to mention in the booths the light is right above your eyes as you watch the game without a dimmer or fogged sheild.   Enjoy you mediocore food, overpriced beer, and fucked up orders. Read the Google reviews much more accurate experience than yelp.",

    "text": "This place is right down the street from the office, and I've gone here with co-workers for lunch many times over the past few months.  The place is okay, and seems to have some serious track betting going on here. Several TV's with horse racing on, machines and some betting tickets and such. I'm not much of a better myself, so I'm not even really sure how it works at this place.  Anyways, I'm kind of torn between two and three stars for this place.  For starters, the inside kind of feels dated, and its always dark when we're there. Also, we usually sit in the back when we are here, since our party size is usually between 6 and 9 people at any given time.  Someone always calls ahead from the office to let them know we're coming in, so they already have the table set up in the back for us when we arrive.  My problem is two fold with Armadillos. First, is that it the service always seems slow, and secondly, they don't seem to have a great lunch menu. It seems to be mostly dinner type dishes, that can be quite big and heavy for the middle of the day.  They have an insert to their menu with \"daily specials\" but nothing that really caters to the lunch crowd.  I mean, sometimes I want a light lunch, not a huge heavy lunch that makes me tired for the rest of the day.  Also, most of the time here it seems to take forever to get our bill, and our food. I know their busy cooking it, but being that they open at 11 AM, and when we arrive we're usually the first people to be in there (aside from a few stragglers at the bar) I wish it wouldn't take so long to get our food.  Plus, we only have an hour for lunch!  One time, it took so long to get our bill, we started getting ansy and tried to hurry out of the place. We have to be back at the office by 12:30, and we didn't get our bills until 12:30!  By the time we all got our change and cards back and left, it was after 12:45, and we didn't get back to the office until 12:50.  We were 20 minutes late back from lunch!  I only go here now because once in a while the ladies from work take me, and its not half bad food. I just wish they had a better lunch time menu and that the service would pick up a bit so we don't spend so much time waiting and paying for our bills.",

Food and drinks were great. We ordered fried pickles, which I am a huge fan of anywhere, but they definitely had by far the best fried pickles ever! Try them with Cajun. Great atmosphere, the waiter was always around the corner and kept checking on us plenty of times throughout our lunch. Will definitely come here more often.",

Their grilled cheese was great but I wasn't a fan of the tomato soup. Then again it was rustic tomato soup which I'd never had before. My husband loved it though who doesn't like regular tomato soup at all. Also can't beat their happy hour. $3.75 long islands! Fantastic. Will definitely be back to try their other menu items.",

Normally, it's annoying when a waitress asks me how I'm doing every 5 minutes, but she was not just trying to earn an extra buck. She was genuinely concerned.  The missing star is because of the style (or lack there is) in the music I heard there. The waitress said it was the bartender's iPod mix. Anyway, I'd bet that they normally play better music.",

(Granted what it is is a sports bar and grill) But the quality of the food and the service was way beyond.  Great Caesar salad with fresh lemon and they brought fresh ground pepper. And the quesadilla came with guac and salsa that were fresh and delicious. House made veggie burger was also very good. Our server was super friendly and even brought us waters to go without is asking. Really great experience.",

    "text": "For me, the best thing about the Armadillo Grill was the waitress.  Fast, attentive, very good interaction with multiple (and difficult) personalities, and knowledgeable of the product.    As far as the food goes, the person I was with swears by their spicy chicken wings.  I'm a big boy and I enjoy having more than a little bite into a wing only to encounter bone on the next nibble, so ... pass for me.  I had the veggie burger, which I would best describe as falafel on a bun.  If you like falafel, you'll like this.  The salad dressing (blue) was weak and the salad itself nothing special.  Likewise, the iced tea was watery.    I was also surprised how warm it was in the restaurant.  Plenty of fans going, but it felt really stuffy  (ironically, when we left later, it felt cooler outside on the wrap-around patio with misters than it did inside.    My friend took me here so we could talk about some private issues he was having.  Why he chose this place -- outside of the fact he's a wing fanatic -- is beyond me.  It is a sports bar and this was evident even at 3pm, when you would think most people would be at work.  To say the noise level was a bit loud is like saying Liberace was slightly flaming.  There were no games on, that I could see, but by the shouts and testosterone-fueled \"yeahs\" you heard every 2 minutes, you would think the Superbowl was moved to a Thursday.  So, in conclusion, while fans of this place will no doubt have many unflattering comments to throw at me -- most regarding my obvious lack of masculinity -- I can only say that this would be the place to go if you're seriously into sports bars or just can't live without their wings.  As for me, I'll take my obviously nelly self to a real place where I can enjoy my food and conversation in peace.",

I'm not into sports so I didn't pay attention to the games that were on. The mozzarella wedges were huge and amazing! Dear God was it good and hearty! Almost wanted to find my mama and slap the piss out of her! My friends got fried pickles as well for an app but yuck...pickles..... I ordered a burger and it actually came out medium like I wanted and it tasted like angus beef. Oh it was so juicy meaty and sexy! The bun was a bit soaked though. The fries were hot and seasoned. My Long Island iced tea was good and my friends seemed to enjoy their cocktails. I recommend coming here for a fun night out with friends, especially if you're into sports and friendly waitresses. One of my friends got the chicken parm... oh my God!!!!! It's soooook delicious ! Chicken perfectly seasoned and crispy! The flavor of the park and the noodles....and it's enough to feed a family. Get it and share it with your friends if y'all are broke like me!",

Food was okay, they have HH menu for half priced of their Munchies menu.  I ordered Black Pepper Calamari, the taste was good, but it wasn't worth the half price they charged me.  The portion wasn't big at all, so I wouldn't recommend you order that dish.  I ordered one of their burgers that I couldn't remember the name.  It was very tasty and the sides come from many choices, including sweet potato fries.  Not many places offer this options and of course I picked it.

    "text": "Well, Armadillo Grill, I'm not a fan.  We came here on Wednesday night for an NBA playoff game after reading the reviews touting the great food and the plethora of TVs. I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back.   Our server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.  My boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was just about average.  They played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.  They do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture.",

I must say, I like coming in here sometimes on Sundays though I typically go to other sports bars to watch my team play. Though other bars might be a bit more modern and have twice as many tvs... Armadillo is not nearly as crowded. It is  nice to not have to search for a spot to sit constantly.  On top of that, the bartenders seem to be a bit more chill overall than most. They are pretty laid back and very personable... hard to find as time goes on. Also, their food is just as good as I remember if  not better. I like getting an order of their wings with a side of vegetables. However, if you do not like sauce drenched soft wings, you should take my advice and order them accordingly: sauce on the side and make the wings 'crispy'.  There seems to be a little something for everyone here... If you feel like getting a little horse race betting in, they have it there. If you want to shoot a little pool, feel free. If you want to have random conversations up at the bar with an old man that wants to explain his take on life... you can get that here too! :)",

We came her on Thursday 5/25 about 10:30 we had a group of about 6, however our server, I think his name was Eric, completely ignored us up until the other table across the restaurant had left. Twice I had to get up and go to the bar to get drinks because the server had not come around for more than 20 minutes or more. I think about it now and that's probably the worst 60 dollars I have wasted. Thanks for ruining our night, appreciate it",

LET ME 'SPLAIN'  One day, maybe two years ago, I had to go to Discount Tires on Camelback, which is quite literally next door to Armadillo Grille.  That first visit, the food was so bad, I thought I'd written a harsh Yelp! criticizing the food.   I don't even recall what I had but it was not good.   I do recall that while the food disappointed that time, the friendliness of the employees was duly noted.  Last week I happened by and ordered the Happy Hour calamari.  For four dollars!  Best $4 calamari I've ever had and I remember the marinara that came with it was delicious.  Then, last night Armadillo Grille served me a chicken parmesan that was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  I don't mean delicious-for-a-local-pub.  I mean it was fantastic!  I will go back for this dish and perhaps others.  What a great meal!",

They didn't include a sauce, so I added ketchup at home. After that, they were delicious. The sauteed onions added a nice flavor to it. I also tried the shrimp from the blackened shrimp Caesar salad and they were orgasmicly good. Full flavored with a slight spicy kick, it's a shame they're only a temporary item on the menu. Nevertheless,  if you see blackened shrimp on the menu, order it. You won't regret it.",

I don't come that often, and it is a pleasant surprise each time how good the food and desserts are because the exterior is so unassuming. Favorite so far is the Smothered Chicken, the Meatloaf is good too. The brownie desert is a must-have for three reasons: 1) It tastes good, 2) the temperatures are perfect and 3) the presentation is fun. What does that mean \"temperatures\"? The brownie is comfortingly warm, the ice cream is ice cold and the raspberry sauce is cool. I've been to other places where the whole dessert is cold, probably because the whole thing is stored in the fridge - which makes the brownie cold, chewy, and sad. No sad food here! Food and dessert at Armadillo Grill and is a happy experience :)",

    "text": "If I could give 6 stars, I would! Their food is great, and their service has always been good. we go there very regularly and have tried almost their entire menu. One thing I really appreciate is that they have a much nicer menu than the regular pub / bar. They also do a weekly special that while I may not like every weekly special, it is unique in that I have not seen it repeat. They are not afraid to come up with new ideas, and some of those ideas have been insanely good- like their chicken hummus sandwich- sounded odd, so I ordered a burger, but the wife tried it and it was so good, we both went back a couple days later so we could have one before next weeks special replaced it. That has happened several times too, and it is a very pleasant change for dining. The manager is also great- a few years back, they were experimenting with other beers on tap, and in doing so removed Guiness from their selection. I voiced my concerns over this as I am a Guiness drinker, and to my surprise, we went there a few weeks later and she personally came up to me, apologized and told me they brought back Guiness! Talk about valuing their customers! This is rare in todays business culture, and that incident made us into long-term patrons! Great food. Great booze. It really has become our favorite place to go when we want to relax, have a drink and a nice meal!",

Our waitress, Virginia, was super nice and helpful. She said she had been there something like 12 of the 17 years they've been open. That's impressive. The food was fabulous... minus the chocolate cherry cheesecake (I just thought it'd be full of sweet black cherries not maraschino cherries- just a personal preference). But Virginia brought the cheesecake out with a special candle for my husbands birthday and that was a nice touch without making a birthday scene!) The buffalo chicken sandwich, Asian slaw and teriyaki chicken kebabs were especially good. Lots of TVs to see whatever sport you'd like and not too dark for a bar with all the windows.

The chicken sandwich was good, the thick steak fries were hot and nicely crispy on the outside. The beef stroganoff was bland, the meat texture was not tender as the dish traditionally should be. The garlic bread sadly made me choke as the chunks of garlic were so overpowering. The service was not attentive.  Had to request refills on our drinks.  100 plus temperatures in Arizona in summer would make you think this would be a priority in restaurants. The waitress did not remove our dinner plates, even when we both indicated we were finished. Not impressed",

You couldn't ask for a better restaurant that caters to everyone's needs. if you want the divey bar feel, they have a great bar set up with new TV's stationed, Megatouch play, pool and darts, and a race horse gambling area.

Their fried pickles come in spears but you can ask for slices. The Armadillo gold wings are tasty (and I'm not a huge fan of wings) but stay AWAY from the hummus because it's terrible.   The staff is friendly and nice, but one time we had horrible service. The water pitcher we asked for since the waitress only came by every 20 minutes had 1/2 water, 1/2 sprite.

    "text": "This place was dissapointing to me. I was excited based on the reviews but wasn't pleased with the food. I ordered a ceasar salad and the dressing was almost slimy. That is the only way I can describe it.  My date ordered a philly cheese steak sandwich that was awful. It tasted like pure salt. Maybe we got the wrong items? The server was nice but pretty pushy on us getting alcohol. The prices were great on the drinks but the margarita was an awful choice. It was bad. The long island ice tea wasn't terrible but I guess this is just a place to go for cheap drinks and medium food. I would prefer going to Chili's over this place. Sorry Armadillo Grill. I wanted to love you.",

I have eaten here a few times, as a friend of mine is a big fan of this place, but I just couldn't see it. It felt like he was talking about a girl he thought was attractive and she gets built up and built up and when you finally meet her you have no idea what he was talking about. She isn't ugly, but you probably wouldn't have gone as far as to say she is all that great, either.   Maybe I haven't ordered the right thing, so next time I head in I'll try something new alongside my dollar cocktail.",
