I love northern Indian food ie shahi paneer, mattar paneer. I asked them what was equivalent. Happy the manager suggested the tika masala. It was great! We have come back once a week ever since. Great customer service, great people, yummmmy food.",

It's a nice set-up, with friendly servers and complete with a bar. The food is fantastic. We usually go for dinner and have ordered a number of dishes. The prawns are always large, the chicken tikka masala is divine and the naan is perfect. Tonight we tried the chicken makhani (spl?) and the chicken andhra. They were both just fantastic. You could taste the grilled, chardness of the chicken in the makhani. And the depth of the flavors in the andhra were amazing. The makhani is quite a rich dish and the andhra was served chicken none in (which keep in mind gives you really tender meat). Don't give this place a miss. Josie the server is always super pleasant and very knowledgable about the menu!",

Although I would say that I am a bit of a foodie, for some reason I have not ventured much into Indian cuisine, but this place has made me a believer.  I went there for the lunch buffet this week, and although I didn't know much of what I was putting on my plate (aside from the tandoori chicken), I have to say that I absolutely loved everything that I tried.  My favorite part was the end of the buffet that the server kindly explained was a selection of chutneys.  I took some of each and really enjoyed the kick of flavor that they gave to the other dishes I was eating.  The mango and cilantro chutneys were my favorites, oh and also the coconut chutney...  Anyway, will definitely come back here with my husband for a weekend date night, goal- to make him a believer too :)",

Also wish they would make a lunch specials (smaller portions/ cheaper price) if so, I would be here everyday! I have yet to try any of there other dishes, since the butter chicken was very addicting!

Of course, I was exited to try this place as I just moved to the valley of the sun from San Francisco. I was highly disappointed with everything we ordered : Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Chilly, Garlic naan and Daal (you cannot mess-up Daal, its like messing up Mac and Cheese). Both chicken dishes tasted exactly the same (which is not correct). Naan was cold (another red flag). Finally the Daal I know most of you don`t order this dish in Indian restaurants as I mentioned it will be like ordering Mac and cheese in an American restaurant. I always try Daal at a new Indian restaurant as this gives me a good idea of how good the food is. It`s a simple vegetarian dish made with Lentils. There are many interpretetion for this dish so very restaurant will have a different take on it. I really wanted this restaurant to be good after all the reviews, but it will be a challenge for me to try this place again.",

Saturday. Lunch buffet. Noon.  8-10 people eating when we arrived.  When we left there at 1230 there was only 1 party left! Table for 2  First thought upon entering- it's kinda warm in here - and it's only 75* outside!  Serving staff of 2 were very friendly and engaging!   Food - decent to good. Not bad. Could be richer. Could be thicker (seemed more watery than the competition up the street). The goat was the best part; plenty of good-sized, meaty chunks. Garlic naan was hot, and good. Mango chutney was on point.   Atmosphere - it's been stated before that the lighting could improve and I agree. Flood lighting that seems to be like spot lights. Read these reviews and adapt!!! Half way through the meal we had to request the air conditioning be turned down and it was then, making it bearable and comfortable.   $2 Heinekens in draft. Yes!   Might come back. Jury's out.",

I got the lamb tikka masala and my boyfriend got the chicken tikka masala. My lamb was medium spice and was seasoned amazingly. The chicken tikka masala was very creamy and balanced well for the rice. It was good food for its price (11.99-12.99). Unfortunately, the stars are so low because we were originally the ONLY people in there to dine, and they rushed to the back and scurried to bring up water and such. We interacted with people 3-4 times, they forgot our drink we ordered and had to remind her (still only customers), my water ran out half way through eating and they didn't refill it til I was already done and asked for a box, we waited too long for our check considering how dead it was, and I don't think they asked how our food was until after we finished it. Overall we will probably grub hub or take out order any future orders because the food is good but service was garbage considering it was a Monday night and no one else was really there.",

Consistent in the fact that it's terrible, that is.  Passage to India is a pretty standard Indian buffet, largely in the fact that it's awful, but different tasting enough from most 'American' fare that most of this venue's patrons are going to be none the wiser.   The food served in the buffet is often bland, stale, and the ingredients are generally third-rate. The service is about as bad as the food, and every waiter I've encountered at this place is either unhelpful or unfriendly. In short, this place is to Indian food what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. Take your $12 elsewhere and you'll probably be guaranteed a superior culinary experience.",

The flavors were vibrant in the saag and pakora, The soup was a bit too salty but still good, However they only had foam cups for the soup. Desert was just kheer and gulab.  Garlic naan is included which is nice.  The rice was just plain basmati rice and it was a bit under cooked. The chai tea is also included.  One nice thing was in the condiments section there was Indian hot sauce.   Overall another decent addition to the Indian food landscape of the area, but nothing too special, at least for their buffet.",

    "text": "Well first of, I was born and raised in India and have been cooking now for over a decade, so I'd like to think I have a good idea of Indian food. My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).  I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.  The food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money.",

    "text": "Overall, 3.5 stars. Came here to try the lunch buffet. The weekend buffet today included several chicken dishes, 2 biriyani dishes, veggie dishes, a seafood/fish dish, and a goat curry. Some notable examples were chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, saag, and paneer makhani. Out of all the dishes I enjoyed the chicken tikka masala and the aloo gobi the best for their use of bold flavor and hearty chunks of meat/veggie. Other dishes such as the chicken keema, while nice that it was included in the buffet (You don't usually see this dish at Indian buffets), tasted slightly underseasoned. I appreciated that you are given the choice of 3 different naans for your table (We chose garlic).   The interior is quite lovely. You can tell a lot of time was placed into making the interior a welcoming, inviting space.  Service was good and the host was doing double duty as waiter. Despite his dual roles he was able to check up on us and refill drinks as needed with a friendly demeanor.  Dessert included kheer (Rice pudding) and gulab jamun. I liked how the kheer was more light, refreshing, and not overly sweet.  Our total for 2 buffet lunches and 2 sodas was around $28. The buffet was decent, and had a good variety. If I'm in the area I'd probably stop by again.",

We only ate part of 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered. Naan was very dry too. When we expressed our concerns to the staff they had a very rude response. We asked them to remove some of the dishes from the bill as we did not eat them. Manager proceeded to storm away after reluctantly agreeing and came back to toss the bill on the table.  About 30-60 min later many of our party members complained of sickness and stomach pains. Do not think this was food poisoning but the food certainly did not make us feel good.  I would never return to eat here in the future",

The masala was great, the rice was flavorful, lentil soup tasty. Goat curry had an amazing flavor. Nothing was too overpowering. It was a great balance of sauce and spice. Just enough spice but not too much to choke you. The naan bread was delicious. My only negative really is that no descriptions were handy and only some names were translated to English. Perhaps the menu had descriptions but we didn't see one. Will definitely come back to try more and learn more about the food.",

I was having some craving for it, though, so i decided I'd have lunch there since my kiddo was with grandma for the after noon.   The place inside is nice, good decor, dark and a little intimate. The gal that seated me and attended to me was friendly and prompt with water and picking up after my plate.   The buffet had many options, which i was a bit impressed with that finding.  I can't remember what all they had but i had several meat dish options and several meatless ones as well. I didn't get to try all of them but i did put on my plate at least 5 things to taste. I enjoyed the flavors of all but can't say any of them made me want to get up and keep going. ..except the spinach. .i really really liked that dish.   I think i always compare Indian buffets to the only one I've ever eaten at consistently and for the longest period of time: Delhi Palace. This tikka masala was not as good as DP,  nor was the Tandoori chkn.  I think their gulab jamun is canned ;'-( here. .. they were not perfectly round, but dented like the kind bought the other day from the local Indian market.  That was disappointing :(  Overall: I'd come back if i wanted a conveniently located solution to my Indian cravings, but it likely isn't my go-to spot like DP.",

    "text": "Ok my rating purely based on the lunch buffet that I am eating right now. I did arrive by 1 pm that's 90 before close.  Most of the items were sitting there and had no freshness or the the taste you will expect. Britain was just ride and small chicken piece while the rice had drive Ed and become hard. Gram lentil (Chana daal) had twice the amount of salt. Goat curry was probably prepared from frozen so it just microwaved hot and in thick gravy no freshness there either. I tried eggplant (baigan bharta) no freshness there either. Naan was not crisp but again probably sitting in over (pre made). Kheer (rice putting) was simple rice and milk. No dry fruits or condensed milk flavor or even elaichi. Gulab jamun were hard dried and no syrup has gone in them.   There was just one girl visible doing food runs and could not get the water to the table so had to remind again.   Having said that, I have had better experience. At dinner time. Both food, drinks and service. But buffet sucks big time. Lesson learnt.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why so many people rating this restaurant are rating it on the buffet. I thought everyone knew Indian buffet food (and probably any cuisine prepared for a buffet lunch crowd) pretty much blows. You always want to order it fresh (we usually order from the menu even at lunch).   I've been eating Indian food for over 20 years and while I know I'm eating a very select and Americanized version of what is really an extremely broad cuisine, I know the difference between good (American) Indian and so-so or bad Indian (I also happen to be a chef). Passage to India is definitely some of the better Indian food I've had in the valley.   Unlike the experiences I've read here, the food has been extremely consistent in quality, flavor and heat (a problem I've encountered with a lot of Indian restaurants). The rice has NEVER been dry, the food has never been overly salted and the wait staff has been very nice and attentive.   Many people familiar with Indian food eat some kind of chicken dish, but I was introduced to it when I was a vegetarian and I still order almost exclusively vegetarian dishes when eating at an Indian restaurant. And I would recommend to those who are trying this restaurant (or any Indian restaurant) to go first for the non-meat dishes to get a sense of the depth of flavors when chicken isn't the core flavor.   We have found Passage to India to be almost always so devoid of people that we have joked that maybe it's a front for something else, that they can't be making any money selling that little food. They also don't have a more traditional decor (in my experience--what do I know about real traditional decor?) that, say, a place like Delhi Palace has. And, finally, not every note is hit perfectly every time; but overall they are very consistent, probably  more consistent than most restaurants I've been to. For those reasons I reduce the stars to 4 instead of 5, but otherwise, enjoy--it's a nice little treasure for Tempe.",

The Naan was all very good. Soft with just a hint of toastiness, not too dry.  The Chicken 65 was unremarkable. Lightly spicy with lots of onion and cilantro.  The Chicken Korma was ordered extra mild for the non spice eater in the group and come out spot on. Very flavorful without any heat. The chicken itself was bonless, tender and absorbed the flavors well.  The Chicken Andhra Curry was ordered medium but came out a little over spicy and astringent. The aroma hinted of flavorful spices but was overwhelmed by the heat of the dish. Surprisingly the chicken was served bone-in! The chicken was swimming in sauce which made it not finger food and made enjoying it more of a task.   The Chicken Tikka Masala was spot on for both flavor and spiciness. The let down was the chicken itself, dense cubes of chicken breast. The chicken was dry and absorbed none of the wonderful flavor in the sauce.   Nothing was really bad, just not fantastic. Worth another visit. Maybe for their lunch buffet, too.",

Our server was very patient and informative in explaining choices and dishes to us, listening to our preferences and making good suggestions accordingly.  Our meals were served in good time, and were absolutely delicious. The lady had the chicken korma prepared \"medium,\" and it was aromatic, creamy and with just the right amount of heat (though we deemed it closer to \"mild\" than \"medium\" but we like hot). The chicken was tender and the portion was just the right size.  I had the lamb roghan josh, also ordered \"medium,\" and it was fantastic. The browned-onion-and-yogurt-based gravy was perfect, with a fair amount of heat and wonderful aromas of garlic, ginger, cloves, cardamom and other yummy spices. Again, the portion was just right. Both dishes were served with a side of white rice.  We will DEFINITELY be returning, and telling family and friends about Passage to India!",

Too many things went wrong the night we first went there, and so I am pleased to see that they work hard to keep customers happy, as the manager's name suggests.

    "text": "I would say the lunch buffet is 3 stars simply because I like my food spicy and boldly flavored, and lunch buffets are much milder and lack that oomph.   That said, ordering dinner portions or ordering to-go is a 4 star experience, so that's what I'm basing my review on.   When I asked them to make it super spicy, they did not disappoint. On a price-to-quality ratio, this place nails the mark. I spend about $40 on a Door Dash order (the only way you can have food delivered from here) and I had enough food for about 4 meals.   Overall, I recommend this place and will be treating it as my go-to for spicy Indian food. I think the other Indian restaurants around here are not as good on the price-to-quality ratio. Example - The Dhaba has really good food, but their portion sizes are really skimpy and they charge too much for those tiny portions.  Pro Tip: If you want delivery and you are a 1st time Door Dash user, you can often get a promo code to save some money. I got $7 off when I made my first order.",

The food is good from mild to spicy...something for everyone vegetarians and non-vegetarians.",

The buffet was not bad, but it wasn't good either.  Usually I go for Indian because of the bold flavors, and there just wasn't any flavor to this buffet.  It wasn't memorable.  The selection of items was just okay.  Not impressed.  I certainly won't be returning for the buffet and most likely not for dinner.  We did have good service, however.",

Food - I liked the food... the chicken tikka masala was probably one of the best that I've had in the valley and the garlic naan was pretty good. However, for whatever reason my gal had really bad stomach aches after eating there. I was perfectly fine... I do tend towards the carnivore dishes though where she is more vegetarian. She really didn't enjoy the experience...  Service - the service was marginally acceptable, once we got their attention they were responsive but there wasn't the usual proactivity that you would expect.  Ambiance - it was fine for a lunch time experience... and there were a good number of people for lunch on a Thursday.",

The manager who's name is Hapi and staff always greet me with a warm welcome. They are clean and have earned an A in their kitchen!

The fact it is a father and son run business with an amazing attitude and gracious service seals the deal. Not all Indian restaurants treat customers this way. Been going there for 5 years and will go there forever. I can not say enough good things about this restaurant's ambiance, service, and quality.

The standouts are the vegetable Pakora, chicken Paneer, chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer and the always spicy vegetable Biryani.  The food is always hot (not warm) and all the options are wonderfully delicious.  The staff is always pleasant and the restaurant is always clean.  If you're near Tempe and your tummy is in the mood for some tasty Indian food, plug in Passage to India into Google Maps.  *Tip 1*   They typically offer a $2 draft.  Last time it was Heineken.  **Tip 2** Check your local mailers.  I've received several discount coupons from PTI over the last 2 years  ***Tip 3*** They have a full bar!!",

We have tried a couple Indian places in Tempe, and nothing else comes close!  The only downside is, their website is a bit user-unfriendly. Not easy to use, especially on a smartphone.

Two lovely ladies greeted us with smiles and were very nice. I ordered the Aloo Gobi and rice. I am on a vegan diet for the moment so I had to ask questions to ensure the meal was dairy and meat free and the server though wasn't confident my specific meal was, but she ensured that everything is cooked to order and not mixed in advance, so whatever I would want they can make it the way I want  it. The aloo Gobi was delicious and it came with rice, and every thing tasted very good. One of my friends ordered the chicken biryani but he got the veggie instead which the server noticed as she brought the meals, so she took it back immediately and the correct dish came out shortly after that. Everyone enjoyed their meals and naan bread too. Would definitely recommend it to everything.",

Started with the Kati Roll with chicken at the suggestion of our nice server. They were flavorful and the sauce for them was terrific. I had the chicken tikka masala and hubby tried the chicken curry. Both were so good I would have licked the bowl had there not been other customers around us.Also had garlic naan and gulab jamun for desert.

Maybe it was a bad day for the chef but I told my gf that if we were served this food in a dumpy restaurant we'd pay, walk out and never come back. We left very unsatisfied and did not take leftovers home which never happens with us. We won't return. The waitress also disappeared for too long at one point...

    "text": "We were there Friday, 2/01 and had the worse service ever.  It was busy and we had no reservations, sat in the bar, and ordered appitizers and one drink while waiting for a table.  The bar tender was awesome, but the food never came and we had to cash out to go to the table which was ready in about a half hour.  Once seated, we didn't get any attention after that.  We asked the hostess for our appitizers and she said she would check...  nothing...  we finally got a waiter after he had a discussion with another waiter in our presense about 'who would take us', and never got to order.  He said he'd be right back...  we asked him about our apps...  he would check...  we ordered dinner...  and again asked about our appitizers...  he came back after we had been seated for 45 minutes at our table (1.25 hrs after placing that appitizer order), and he said he didn't know what to say.  The order was never placed.  So we said we wanted our money back and wanted to leave.  He took our paid receipt, went back to 'talk with someone' and said the charge would be voided.  Today (2/7) I checked my credit card company, and not only was the $22.88 charge processed...  they processed it for $26.88 ($4 more!!).   Amazing.   So who knows about the food?  We sure don't and wasted 1.5 hrs total for nothing but a credit card problem that's now under dispute.",

    "text": "Went for the buffet and was not disappointed.   Passage -- specializing in North and South Indian cuisine -- offers one of the more extensive menus I have seen as an Indian restaurant.   But, please, that isn't saying much considering my home base is in Tucson where we are fairly short on very good Indian food.   Menu items include kati, pakora, mirchi; soups like sambar and mulligatawny; dosa -- yay!; various types of biryani, including goat; korma, curry, saag (one of my favorites), vindaloo; and even Chinese options -- what, what? Yes, there's fried rice and Schezuan noodles on the menu. Random.   Lots of naan, too: plain, garlic, paneer, onion, keema and others.   I especially enjoyed the saag, tikka masala and the aloo gobhi. A few dishes may be lacking in spice and heat, but I am guessing that's because the buffet is trying to cater to an expansive range of tastes. No problem. I get it.   I like the layout of the place. It is very casual during the afternoon, but has the feeling of being able to dress of very nicely for the evening.  Takes reservations by phone and online.",

(7pmish)  Waiting 15 mins for drinks and someone to take our order when we heard a ruckus. Owner had to forcibly remove some guy from the bar area, he called the cops, but didn't come by to apologize or ask if we had been helped.  Place was pretty empty. Emo chick took order, and brought the food with as much personality as dry toast on the side of the road.  We ate a few bites before asking for a to go boxes, paid and left. No personality. For 65 plus tip, I think not.",

Main course included Lamb curry, tandoori chicken, couple vegetable entrees, chicken tikka masala as well as chicken and vegetable biriyani. They also had a separate salad/desert bar.  The food unfortunately seemed like it had been there on the warmer for a few hours. The chicken was dried out. The biriyani rice was also quite dry. We were 8 adults so some of the items ran out. When we called the staff of they could re stock some of it they said the chef had already left and there was nothing they could do about it. This was around 245 so technically food should be kept available since they advertise the buffet being open till 3 pm. Regardless the food over all was average at best. Could use more spice and seasoning.   I would recommend that you go earlier in the day if you wanna try the buffet.",

We came in for a late-ish dinner, 815 on 12/21 (Thursday) and had the place to ourselves... Which should have been a sign, but after a long work-day I was happy for the quiet atmosphere.  We were greeted, seated, and provided with water and papadum, which we happily began to snack on... and then we saw it.  Among the little black spots on the papadum (the customary ingredients) one of them was moving... a tiny little black bug, maybe the size of a seed bead, crawling across the surface of the remaining cracker in the basket.  We called the server over to show her.  She looked at it with a horrified expression, but made zero move to bring it to the attention of management.  We got up and walked out.  Folks, running a restaurant isn't rocket science - the rules can be broken down into 2 main tenets - a) serve quality product and b) don't have bugs.  We went to Delhi Palace near the university and had a fine meal, and will not be returning to Passage of India.  You shouldn't either.",

They had these almost like flood lights outdoor lighting in some of the areas. It felt too bright in the spots and made the restaurant seem industrial, not warm and inviting.   As my usual I got chicken Tikka masala with garlic naan. I thought the chicken Tikka was too salty. The naan was OK seemed a little dry to me.  I also had a mango lassi which was delicious.   Overall it seemed like a nice place and maybe there were other dishes that would be delicious, but chicken Tikka masala is my favorite and if I don't like it then I'm probably not coming back. Also the lighting situation really bugged me. Maybe they don't turn those bright lights on in the day time.",

When walking in the first thing to hit you is the delicious smells of Indian cuisine. Our waiter seated us quickly and asked right away what we'd like to drink and what type of naan we'd like. The decor is tasteful and clean, the buffet quite extensive. All our favorites were offered including some items we hadn't seen before. Our go to is always the chicken tikka masala and it didn't disappoint. The sauce was thick and creamy, not watered down like most places offer for lunch, and they used white chicken meat versus fatty sub-par dark meat. Their buffet is only $10.99 so well worth the delicious flavors. Definitely a must try!!!",

I ordered the goat biryani, and for those of you who know what this is will understand why i was pissed that they brought out steamed basmati rice with goat curry under the rice (2 piece of meat that were 80% bone).

There are a few reviews about food on Yelp, but from what everyone tasted during our dinner is definitely encouraging.  Chicken Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala were excellent and this place has Hyderabadi Dum Biryani which was great.  Definitely has a mix of South and North Indian dishes on the menu.  They are new and still making adjustments, but definitely worth giving them a try... i would!!",

There was NO service , no usher . We should have left then but thought of giving it a chance. We went over to the bar and ordered a Long Island Iced Tea. The bartender gave us an amused chuckle and we asked him what was up . He said he had never made LIIT before!! And he s supposed to be a bartender for heaven's sake ! Though he was making drinks by checking out recipes on his phone,he insisted on making our drink . Came back in 5 minutes and said he doesn't have all the ingredients for the drink . Talk about a \"full bar\"!!! He gave us a weird drink and said he would charge us 7 bucks for it . The gobi manchurian came after an eternity , was cold and tasting weird again . Do I need to go on .. Bad experience .",

I gambled but shouldn't have as the drink was nothing even close.  Not a good start.  The four of us ordered an assortment of food and shared it between us.  The lamb meat was grisly although the taste was good.  Prawn dish was fine with big, meaty prawns but not many of them and the sauce, ordered medium, was anything but spicy.  Vindaloo was spicy enough but only about 10 chunks of chicken in the dish.    We got both garlic and onion naan and it was good.    Summary: It wasn't bad but isn't worth going back either.",

We were delighted to find many of our favorites were also offered in the buffet, along with may things we have never tried.  Positive- we liked many of the dishes we have never tried before, we now have many new favorites when we go back Negative- our tried and True favorites that we normally ordered were much much better when we got them fresh as individual entrees vs. on the buffet line. I am glad that we have eaten here many times before with regular entrees! The buffet included a couple of soups and salad bar along with a basket of naan delivered to the table. White rice along with a couple types of biryani rice were included in the buffet. Highlights included the goat curry, chicken tikka masala, matar paneer (cheese and peas in a creamy sauce), saag spinach,  and the mirchi ka salan (green peppers, tomatoes and onions with sauce). We enjoyed the old favorites and are excited to have a few new favorites to order now!",

Tonight we had palak paneer and malai kofta as well as garlic naan. The malai kofta is the best we have ever had and my husband and I eat a lot of Indian food. The palak paneer was delicious as well. Last time we got everything hot, but it was really to hot for us (despite loving hot, spicy food), so we went with medium this time and that was perfect. One of our favorite things is the bar. When you order a margarita, they bring you your drink and 'extra'. It's like getting 2 drinks for the price of one. Service has always been great and we have gotten our food very quickly. Though we are not of Indian heritage, most of the clientele is.  Always a good sign!",

It was spacious and comfortable.  It's definitely something that one would ascribe to a high-end restaurant. They had wide booths, and charming decor.  However, the food, although  decent, was a bit disappointing.  We like our Indian food spicy. We're used to it. Anything less than that often falls flat as far as we're concerned. Such was our experience with Passage to India. Some other guests may find mild Indian cuisine preferable, but we like to suffer with the heat of a real Indian meal.  All the dishes we had were quite mild in comparison to our normally visited restaurants. The tikka masala was decent if a bit boring, but the lamb vindaloo didn't come alive to our palates whatsoever. The tandoori chicken was  a tremendous disappointment as it was cold and stale. Since we got there around 12:30pm, that was very surprising.  To top it all off, the Naan was nearly forgotten and definitely gave new meaning to the term \"flat bread.\"  The only redeeming part of this was that their service was passable, if somewhat forgetful and inattentive.  Perhaps, we caught them on an off day. We may consider re-visiting this place at another time, if only to give them one more try.",

No one greeted us as first, then finally a few minutes the hostess/waitress came out the back to show us a table. Afterwards water and menu were brought out. We reviewed the menu for a good 5 minutes to know what to order. Waited another 10 minutes, no one came by. Another group came in to the restaurant and was unsure if it was opened, since the staff was nowhere to be seen. We were thinking, if they are not attentive to their customers, then what would make us think they would be attentive to cooking our food. With this type of service, we decided to no longer try this place. When we walked out, the server said, bye, hope you enjoyed and thank you for coming. I think she thought we stayed to eat at the restaurant.",

Things I liked:  - Lack of tablecloths (I just don't like them, but that's 100% subjective)  - The food was good  - Lots of vegetarian options at the buffet  - Prompt but not oppressively attentive service  - Very clean bathrooms   Things I wasn't AS into  - The food is pretty mild? I have a moderate spice tolerance, and the food here didn't challenge me remotely  - The naan is brought in a basket individually to tables, rather than available continuously at the buffet. This isn't REALLY a problem, it's just counter to my preference.   This isn't my favorite Indian buffet experience ever, but it is certainly at least on par, and I'll probably end up going back. I'd recommend it particularly if you like Indian flavors but are really sensitive to spice levels.",

The food is fairly good and the price is right for the lunch buffet. I usually just eat the vegetarian options and I appreciate that they offer quite a few vegetarian items in their lunch buffets. The food is flavorful enough but I do agree with other reviews that it lacks enough spice or kick. I imagine with a lunch buffet serving many customers with different tastes, they have to be careful with the amount of spice and heat that they use. Free chai tea which is nice. Food is on par with some other area Indian restaurants but I have also had better elsewhere (for a heftier price tag). Still, it's good comfort food for the buffet price.  Restaurant is usually not too busy for the times that we have gone there. The place is clean. Staff have always been friendly and welcoming and I feel they are attentive to customers.",

Don't get me wrong, the vindaloo is the best in the valley, but I have not had a dish here that wasn't excellent!  They don't use fillers in their dishes (typically potatoes) which many Americanized Indian restaurants do these days.

When we first arrived on a Friday evening at around 5:30 PM, the restaurant smelled amazing and the place was relatively empty. I ordered the chicken tika masala, and it did not disappoint! You have the choice between mild, medium, and hot masala sauce - be careful if you order the hot and you're not used to spicy! The dinner portions were huge (I probably could have shared mine with my sister), and I definitely enjoyed everything along with their buttered naan.  This will definitely be the place that I visit when I'm craving Indian food. I just wish that they'd fix their website so that I could order online. It'd definitely be a lot easier and more convenient.",

I will start out with saying the food is ok. Had the chicken Makhani (Butter Chicken). It is not the best in town but obviously good enough for my girlfriend and I to have gone back a few times. The real problems come in with customer service and issue resolution.   My experience with one lunch at P2I - Called ahead to see if they had makhani chicken on the buffet, the said yes and disappointingly, they did not. Had a group of 8 that showed up at 11:30, well before the lunch rush. 6 had the buffet and 2 ordered from the menu (butter chicken ;-)). The food was not to temperature even though it took 30 minutes to arrive and we did not receive everything that we ordered. The buser refilled our Sprite with water and almost did it again.  We had to track down our waiter, like he was avoiding us, to ask for our bill. He was able to print out a bill and a receipt for the 2 that didn't get the buffet but for the rest, \"if you just put your cards in the booklet, I will run them for you\". Not a good idea. A business is required to provide that information to you prior to running your card plus they need a signature after the transaction. 30 minutes later still no bill or receipt. They were having POS issues (a little pun intended). All other tables had received a bill and have left at this point.  We asked for the manager and was not sympathetic to the fact that the food was not hot, we did not get all our food, the bill, and that his guests have to go back to work. No discount, nothing was removed from the bill, not even a coupon for next time. The biggest kicker... they still ended up charging 20% gratuity.  I will not be going back again and will not be recommending this place to anyone.",

I called in a reservation for 14-18 people and when we arrived they had everything set up very nicely and seated us immediately.  We had a side room all to ourselves and a dedicated waitress.   We ordered drinks and a couple appetizers.  Then they sent out two complimentary appetisers, the Gobi Manchurian and the Chilly Chicken.  The Chilly Chicken was excellent but the Gobi Manchurian surprised everyone.  It was amazing.  We all kept asking how cauliflower could be this good.  Seriously. Order this.  Then our main courses came.  Everything came as ordered.  There were few orders of Chicken Tikka Masala which everyone said was very very good.  Also the spiciness levels were perfect.  My wife wanted the heat to make her cry a bit and it did.  The medium had kick but didn't make anyone suffer.  Mild was just awesome tasting.    I ordered the Chicken Dum Biryani but I wish I had trusted my gut an ordered the goat.  Not because the chicken was bad.  It was delicious and reminded me of the meals my friends from India cook for us.  It was just that one of my friends ordered the Goat Vindaloo and raved about it.  My experience was echoed by the other 13 people in our party.  We all had a wonderful time and it could not have gone better.  We will all be returning again and bringing as many new faces as possible to this wonderful restaurant.",

They've improved their in-person wait staff a lot and that's great. But the staff don't know what the dishes are most of the time and can't answer questions because they don't know what is in them and they've never eaten them. The menu is unreliable and often they will say you can't have something because they don't have it that day or the chef is out. I have *never* been able to order from their south Indian menu. Half the time their phone is off the hook so you can't order takeout and grubhub has had to cancel my order because they don't have what their grubhub menu says they have.

They have a moderately stocked full bar with a small, but well chosen selection of beers on tap. So far I have only had a few of the appetizers, but I have been pleased with each dish I have tried. I like spicy food, and the hot is spicy enough to have great flavor and sneak up on you towards the end, but not too spicy as to not be enjoyable.  Prices are great for HH, and overall, very competitive. Given the quality of the food, well worth the price.   Overall, a great place, and I will be back many more times. Cant wait to try the duck!",

But the worst part of our night was that when we had ordered paneer tikka masala, we were given chicken tikka masala. we went home and started to cut the supposedly paneer in the entree, only to realize it was chicken. Now, it is understandable that the order got mixed up. But what irked me was that when I called them to tell about it, the owner acted like its not possible and that I was mistaken. Even though we are vegetarian, we know what chicken looks like. He was extremely rude and asked me to come all the way back to the restaurant to examine the dish himself or to email photos of it. I decided to do neither coz I was completely pissed at the way this was handled. I wouldn't have minded if I hadn't gotten my money back, but to treat a customer like this, all for $10 is unacceptable for me. Terrible way to run a business, and that too when it is new! Anyway, we're never going back and recommend that people check their dish before eating it, coz they are never going to accept their mistake.",

We got the Lamb Tikka Masala and the Malibu Malabar entrees and garlic Naan and it was all delicious! We will be back often.  To update, we come here very often. The staff are still extremely polite and friendly. The happy hour food is awesome and cheap! We also love the drink menu - the lychee martini, the mango martini, and the kamasutra martini with passionfruit and pineapple are all delicious! The staff have made helpful recommendations about what to try too. The place is not too crowded and the service is faster these days (which others had complained about previously). I highly recommend Passage to India!",

It's damn good.  My wife keeps it simple with the Tandoori Chicken Machkni.  I have had a bunch of different things and I will be using this place to educate myself about Indian food.  The Lamb Rogan Josh and the Andrea Curry are both awesome.  The service is always good.  It's a new place with an occasional hiccup, but they always work hard to fix the problems.  If I felt more qualified to rate Indian food I'd give this place five stars, but it's a solid four to be sure.",

Yes, a get your drink on and go native with naam bread, simosas and tandoori chicken half off appetizers. I know, it's da bomb, yes?!   They have a very nice bar which when I hit it up is usually just me and possibly some poor sap who has joined me and a couple dozen engineers from the various software companies around the area. I can't say I do any interacting with any of the other patrons, I have an engineer at home, why do you think I'm at the bar to begin with....!   I do chat the bartender up and he is extremely nice and likes to watch a lot of golf and cricket...I'm learning nothing about either sport but we do talk about how little I know about Indian food and culture. Turns out I'm Indian ignorant and I get the impression he runs into this a lot so, he spends time answering a lot of questions that start with, what is this and how do you say? I tip well and he's either very patient or I tip a lot better than I realize. Who knows.   I have had dinner here with the aforementioned engineer and we both enjoyed the meal immensely. We explained to our server our complete lack of knowledge when it came to the menu and explained our food preference by saying, \"we like curry and we like things spicy but not too spicy\". Which I suspect is the epicurean equivalent of saying, I like my food tasty but not too tasty...Our server didn't bat an eye and made a couple of suggestions and we really enjoyed ourselves. The food is very fresh, the ingredients are of very high quality and overall the prices were reasonable, the service impeccable and I truly can't wait to go again.",

It's worth $5. Buffet... Why do all these people think they can run restaurant..  Blue moon beer with no orange slice...I bet you it is Indian restaurant with illegal Mexican cooks..

They had Heineken on draft, can't beat that.  As for the food, though, I ordered the chicken Tandoori to play it safe.  It was prepared smothered with onions, I was not used to that.  It was still good but I don't think all the onions helped.  I also ordered a vegetable soup which was quite spicy, but of course that is to be expected with Indian food.  Overall the servers were friendly and attentive.     So I will return to Passage to India, but not right away.",

We never got sick eating outside food ever, because we eat out so much that our body got immured by now. But buffet at Passage of India today was one of the most terrible ones ever. The food was STALE for sure & both me & my spouse are sick in the stomach. Suffering really bad due to their old stale horribly tasting food. Unfortunately we also offered some naan to our 20mo son & we have been changing his diapers non-stop. Never going back!  Update: Went there 5hrs ago & we are still suffering big time. Now rushed to doctor who said we all have food poison including our toddler. Screw you stingy PoI management who were so cheap to use stale food to save a few bucks. We are vegetarians. How much did you save on our food, max $10 overall? But you lost customers who would pay $30minimum each time we could have visited if you maintained some quality. I hope FDA & health departments inspect you! We are leaving it with a review because we are not one of those suers. One day soon you'll get there if you continue such cheap tricks.",

    "text": "Passage to India is solid from start to finish. The food is delicious, I've been back a few times now to satisfy the craving for Indian food. I've tried several items off the menu, and they were all pretty tasty. In addition to that, Passage to India definitely doesn't skimp on the protein. Portions are huge, and come with a ton of meat. My biggest pet peeve with a lot of the nearby places is ordering something like Lamb Saag and getting only two or three pieces of lamb. But, you definitely won't have that problem here. The vegetarian dishes I've had are also quite good, and the spices and herbs they put on the various naan they serve are always fresh and fragrant.   Service is fairly no frills - don't expect much more than drink refills and order taking, but, that's all I'm looking for personally. The waitresses are polite and get the job done. My only real complaint is that they weren't particularly good at fielding questions about the menu and what not when I brought some friends who were less familiar with Indian food than myself. Indian food can definitely be a bit intimidating so I think it's important for staff at these sorts of restaurants to be able to do a good job helping people who haven't had it before. But, that's not too big of a deal. It's not like they were rude, they just weren't super good at explaining what certain dishes were like.  In general, I don't understand the series of negative reviews this restaurant has. I've had better and I've had a lot worse. But, again, this place is solid. I haven't had a single thing here that wasn't delicious. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",

The restaurant is very clean and \"Happy\" is happy to greet you.  Whatever you order, get the naan. Try a couple.  I love the butter, onion and cheese naans.  This is some of the best naan out there.   The dishes can be ordered spicy, which I prefer. There is enough heat that you feel it but it doesn't drown out the flavor. The flavors are amazing!  I tried the Chicken Andhra Curry for the first time and it is full of different flavors that had my head spinning it was so good.  The goat and lamb dishes are delicious.    **But if you can only get one dish, get the Chicken Tikka Masala, you will thank me. I don't know how they do it, but the chicken is some of the most tender white meat I've ever had.  I'm drooling thinking about it.  I've turned several friends onto Passage to India and they LOVE IT!  Go now, thank me later.",

If you're in the Tempe area you can do MUUUUUCH better with a place like Kebab Palace, India Gate or even The Dhaba.  This place has a great location but it looks like some friends took what was in there garage, found a used hot food table on craigslist and stuck it in a corner of the restaurant.  Tandoori chicken that tasted boiled and had literally no flavor.   Dry NAAN  The Chicken Tikka Masala was decent  Vegatable Pakora that was cold, along with most other dishes.  No salt, no pepper available and lastly and most irritaingly, not spicy at all!  Skip it and save your money.  THE SUCK!!!!",

The chicken marsala and saag we had mild flavored and it was still very well seasoned and delicious. The garlic naan was light and soft and went great with the two chicken dishes. They give you a lot of food, so be prepared to share and to take some home. My friend and I definitely plan on going back as they have a lunch buffet and the waiting staff was very nice.",

The menu is full of great tasting options including great vegetarian dishes for the common meat eater (I have 2 vegetarians and 1 vegan in the house. They all love this place.) Try the Manchurian Gobi, best cauliflower ever. The service is good and the food is consistent. This is one of the gems.",

The food was good, though I thought some of the dishes were missing the kick and flavor that I've had at other Indian restaurants and have come to expect. The price was reasonable as well - under $10. The waitress came around and filled my water regularly. Overall, it was a good experience, but not a great one. Good food, but I've had better.",

I don't know who would call this restaurant overpriced, it's cheaper than Olive Garden and the food is waaaay better.   We got Chicken 65 for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised. It was a good amount of food for an appetizer and the chicken was really yummy, spicy but with lots of flavor. Then, I got Korma chicken and asked them if they could combine chicken with the vegetarian option (I really wanted veggies in my dinner that night:) and they did, no problem. I thought it was pretty good, could've been a little more flavorful but now I'm just being picky. My husband got Lamb Rogan Josh which he said was really good, the lamb was tender and the whole dish was delicious. We also got an order of cheese stuffed Naan bread which came out hot and very tasty.   The service was very quick, our waitress was polite and accommodating, no complaints there. We'll definitely be back, even though it's a little bit out of our way, we had great dining experience there!",

Although MY 1st time with food from India, my son had previous experience with this spicy Indian cuisine...So he knew what he liked...We also asked our server for some guidance.We tried a few dishes...: We split everything...1st, a vegetable \"fritter\" type appetizer with some spicy chutney; Then, spicy lentil soup I broke up my fritter into the soup---- yummie. Then we tried 3 very different-from-each-other \"main dishes\": Lamb Tikka Masala: A kind of meat stew with a red curry very robust gravy Very good and very rich....Chili Vegetables, A sort of \"vegetable hash\" of potatoes, carrots, peas, onions, bell peppers,cauliflower in a spicy sauce; and Palak Paneer, a spinach/ cheese dish which was very good. The flavors were wonderful and each dish had a different spice/flavor palate. We ordered it extra spicy-- and our waiter and waitress advised against it. We convinced them we could handle it. So they were VERY surprised when we asked for more of the spicy sauce to kick the heat up a couple of notches. We topped it off with a sweet \"smoothie\" type mango yogurt drink Kulfie, and a cup of Indian Chai tea. Plenty of left-overs for take home and we spent about $50 plus tip. I understand that lunchtime, they have a huge selection, served buffet style, and it would allow for an economical way to try more of these very savory dishes.I would do this again!",
