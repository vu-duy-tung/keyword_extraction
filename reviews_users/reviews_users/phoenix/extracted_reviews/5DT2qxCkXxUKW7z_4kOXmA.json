The food is excellent, but it's always a guessing game with the level of spice. We always say medium because we don't know what we're going to get. We like spicy food so it's not a problem for us. Thai tea with boba is always a treat. We just learned you can bring your own bottle for dinner which will be helpful in the future.",

I order the drunken noodles, YUMMY as well as the crab pulls, egg rolls with chicken, pad thai, fried rice and a taro boba. I love how sweet everyone is there. Atmosphere is darling and the restaurant, though found in a retail strip, YOU WANT TO GO HERE!!!! Perfect for kids too, especially if you sit by their super duper cool fish tank. We drive from North Scottsdale to Sala Thai to get the best Thai food we have found in the good ol' State of Arizona.",

I called them to let them know and they just said they don't fix orders unless items are mixed up. Customer service is definitely lacking, I won't be giving them another shot after this.

Sala thai changed my mind about thai food and now I crave it constantly!   My first visit I was greeted by the server with cool hair who recommended the drunken noodle and it was unbelievable. Now I am obsessed with their yellow chicken curry and thai iced tea. So the food is most important but this is a family business and one I feel great supporting. The guy with cool hair works every time I come in and always has a huge smile on his face. It's nice to see people enjoy their jobs. I only have positive things to say about all of their food, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the staff. If you haven't been here yet... What are you waiting for?!",

Ingredients were fresh and tasty, but portion was somewhat skimpy for the price and the dish itself was uninspired (only a couple slices of bell pepper accompanied the meat). Both problems could be solved by adding some Asian vegetables to the mix at negligible cost. What really disappointed was the rice. It stuck together so badly, they could have sweetened it and called it a \"Sticky Rice\" dessert! Seriously, it was like the example of bad rice that sticks together on the Minute Rice TV commercial. Also, someone should tell them using plastic fish in an aquarium is tastelessly tacky. Either get real fish or get rid of the tank.",

They were very refreshing, and at $3 apiece, well worth the price to cool some of the spiciness of the food (which was tolerable at a 3).  We had the crab wontons, tom yum, basil duck (which was the special) and spicy basil fried rice with beef. Everything was really great, and priced very moderately. The waiter checked on us consistently and everything about our experience was perfect. From the moment we sat down to the payment of our $45 bill - which is not bad considering how much we ate! GO.

The \"front\" is right next to the door and the cash register where everyone walks right by.  So we asked if we can wait for a table and she says NO. I asked her if she could take a look and see if anyone is close to leaving. There will be no tables for a long time everyone just sat down she mumbles. So I'm like, ok well maybe we will just order to go. And she hands us a menu. As she hands us the menu a couple walks in and sits at the other small table in the front. After about 5 min, a table leaves and they get sat!!  Meanwhile, we are still sitting here waiting for our take out. Its now been 20 min since we placed our order.  I pointed this out to the girl in the front and she dismissively says \"sorry i made a mistake\". WOW!  Boy are we going to miss Little Peking!!!",

Drunken noodles and Red Curry Duck (Awesome) Pad Thai, weird taste, brown sauce just had a strange taste. Visiting Thailand over 25 times, I know my pad thai but this wasn't good. Pork satay had a great taste and nice char but very tough meat.  I feel the prices are high for what you get and it would also be nice to enjoy the meal with a glass of wine or a cold Singha.

Waiting for a table, waiting for someone to take our drink order, waiting for our food, and then waiting a ridiculous amount of time for our check. My son actually sat with his hand raised like they do in school in hopes that someone, anyone, would come over to our table. I could hear the couple next to use complaining through their meal as well due to forgotten items and waiting for their server.  The food was simply ok this past visit. The flavors used to be vibrant and when you ordered something spicy it had some kick but lately everything just seems a little off and bland. We had pad Thai, sweet and sour chicken and a chicken red curry dish. None of the items were bad but they certainly weren't memorable either. The angel wings were a bright spot in the meal and recommended if you stop by. The Thai tea was also quite good.

It had no real fish but a bunch of little ones that constantly floated around...geniusness!  Back to the food. Ordered pad see ew with chicken. The portion was pretty small and it lacked noodles. There was plenty of broccoli though. The Thai BBQ chicken was ok. Nothing too special about it. As for the garlic chicken, I don't even know if we got the right order? Our waiter said it was, but I would have renamed it crispy/deep fried chicken with some sort of sweet chili sauce? Don't know what happened there, but at least that portion size was decent.

Both were good but the wonton soup was sooo good! The broth was excellent and it was not lacking in veggies or in the number of wontons they put in there! I was very pleasantly surprised. I walked in 10 minutes prior to them re-opening for dinner and was still greeted with kindness and was able to place my order right away. The young man at the counter (the owner's nephew) was so friendly and helpful in answering my handful of questions. I received above average service for sure. My food was out in a matter of 10 minutes max. Would definitely return.",

Terrible for you yes, but the extra richness suits me just fine.  It was a party of 15 so service was a little slow but like I said 15 people you kind of need to expect that but the staff was very friendly and there were no order errors which is always a plus.     Whenever I do Thai I almost always get curry.  Same here, I got the masmun curry with tofu and it was wonderful.  I wish there was a better rice to curry ratio as I had so much leftover rice, but I find there is never enough curry.  I also had a bite of my friend's drunken noodles and they were fairly good, but the curry was better. My one slight dissapointment was that spice level seemed off as I and almost all of my companions rated the spice level milder than what they were expecting.  I got a level 3 and felt like a 4 or maybe even a 5 would have been tolerable.  All in all though it was a great introduction to Phoenix Thai and I would happily eat here again.",

I did a pickup last week of what I normally eat there.  Pumpkin curry with shrimp.  The times I ate at the restaurant I was served 8 to 9 nice sized shrimp but when I got the take out I found only 4 in my order.  This combined with them now charging you a fee to open your bottle of wine I have now revised my 5 stars down to 3. I will now be on the lookout for another Thai restaurant with good food, good prices, and no fee for opening my bottle of wine.

    "text": "Sala Thai was the latest stop on my husband's and my quest for the holy grail, a.k.a. our search to find satisfying and authentic Thai food in Phoenix. I must say that Sala Thai is among the best places we've tried since we arrived here from California.   We met Jim W and Audrey W (our fellow voyagers on our Thai food search) for dinner at Sala last Sunday night. As Jim mentioned in his review, Sala Thai isn't nearly as far away from South Phoenix or Chandler as you would think it is, especially on a weekend night when traffic is minimal. The restaurant was decently crowded when we arrived, but we got a nice booth just a minute or so after.   It took us a while to decide what to order as the menu was huge and had a lot of new, interesting dishes like the \"Thai Egg Bomb\" (think Thai omelette, not the sulphuric smell released after eating too much Pad See Ew). After a long deliberation (thank you to our waitress for being patient with us!), we selected the pork satay appetizer, Pad Thai with chicken, catfish Panang curry, spicy basil fried rice with beef, and the duck curry. Just as at Swaddee (our favorite Thai place so far), we were asked to select a spiciness level from 1 - 5. We picked a different level for each dish, so we could see what the range of spiciness was like.   Well, as Jim also mentioned in his review, the pork satay was disappointing - while the peanut sauce was great and not too sweet, the pork was overdone and chewy. The duck curry was decent, although it was a little milky for my taste. I prefer my curry to have a thicker consistency and less coconut milk. The duck was great, though, with a nice crispy skin. Similarly, the crispy catfish topped with panang curry could have been improved with a thicker and more intense curry. The fish was good-quality, however, and was definitely a nice mild compliment to the curry's spiciness.   The real stand-outs for me were the basil fried rice and the Pad Thai. The Pad Thai had an almost meaty flavor to it (must be a different regional version of the dish than the sweet/sour or peanuty versions that are served at most Thai places), and was just the right level of sauciness. I was also impressed with the quality of the chicken. The basil fried rice was outstanding as well - the beef was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the crispy bits of basil added a wonderful flavor.   Since the curries are what keep me coming back to a Thai place, I was a little disappointed that Sala's weren't as good as those I've had elsewhere in the area. However, our meal was highly flavorful and enjoyable, and I would definitely rank Sala up towards the top of the places we've tried in Phoenix (see my list at <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/list_details?list_id=Pa46iQOM92L75uQoyyuRlQ\">yelp.com/list_details?li...</a>).   Jim and Audrey - I look forward to the next stop on our tour!",

There is something that most Americans don't really understand about Thai food.  Everyone has their own take on recipes.  American food was like that at one point as well... thank goodness we still have our differences in BBQ styles...  anyway the point is what makes one Thai restaurant better than another is mostly preference, not authenticity.  That being said, Sala Thai's cuisine is the closest thing I have found to the delightful flavors of my youth.  There flavor's are all spot on and exactly the way they should be.  There ingredients are great quality (Where do they find kale that sweet!?!?) and make the food that much better.  There Prices are ridiculously low!  What is not to like about this place?  What you will get if you dine here; Friendly service (they are Thai, I don't think they know how to not be friendly), Excellent food (flavor and quality), at the best prices!  What you wont get; Anything Fancy, and you shouldn't Thai food is enough in and of itself!  Anyways check it out you wont be disappointed.  If it is to far West for you can check out Swaddee, though it is more expensive..  *edit*  The food is still great but the prices have gone up to the point where it isn't the same killer value it once was... still, great Thai food.",

Being that people in the area had such sensitive tastebuds, we took a chance on the 4 and we were so happy.  The green bean dish with beef was out of this world - a nice balance of lemongrass, basil and heat.  Their green curry with chicken is bursting with fresh vegetables picked up from the farmer's market that morning.  The service is quick and efficient.

This place is owned and run by an actual Thai family who visit Thailand and their family there.  The help are Thai and the food is authentic although as all foodies understand  versions of dishes vary by regions and by the chef/cook crafting each dish.   If every chefs/restaurants dish tasted the same life would be boring!!       The Curry is exceptional no matter what type, the usual dishes we enjoy are always freshly cooked.    The owners will not serve my favorite Mango with Sticky rice (heaven) unless just the right mangos are available.I also get carry out from here several times a month and am always pleased.   Their lemon chicken soup drives away my colds.   The ice cream they make fresh with coconut milk is wonderful.  This is usually a peaceful, low noise get away with a large clientele.  As for those that want alcohol , most of us go to have amazing food---- several bars are close if you need alcohol.",

Tonight was especially fun sitting next to the fish tank with about a hundred fake fish swirling around in it. It held my daughter's attention at least.

The pad thai was good, but I've had a lot better elsewhere. The thai fried rice was probably the best thing that we had there.    The service was mediocre.

    "text": "I have been eating at Sala Thai for at least 4 years now.  I thought I had done a review, but I guess my \"Brain to Yelp\" Implant wasn't working that day.  Anyway, this one of the best Thai restaurant I have found in the Phoenix area and they have an extensive menu that should have something for everyone.  I generally get the Thai Omelet with Pork, or if I feel like getting a variety by trading portions with my wife I'll get veg/tofu dish.  The omelet is stuffed with your choice meat, clear noodles and other good things. It is not greasy at all and has a fluffy texture.  It is severed with a side of fish sauce to drizzle over the omelet.  We have tried several of the veg/tofu dishes with Spicy Green Bean, Spicy Ginger, Pad-Woon-Sen and Spicy Basil Leaves being the highlights, but all the dishes I've tried have been tasty and fresh.  Last time my dad was in town we took him here and he ordered the Chicken Satay to share, it had a fresh grilled taste and had a nice dipping sauce.  The majority of the dishes can be prepared with your choice of meat or tofu for the protein and you select the level of spiciness you would like.  They also have a vegetarian page in the menu that includes some appetizers and entrees prepared vegetarian.   They have expanded the dining area, so now you rarely run into long waiting times that was once a problem here. One of my favorite things about Sala Thai is their \"mocktail\" drink selection including several fruit flavors, Thai iced tea, Thai coffee and I believe they also recently added Boba style drinks.  They use to have a dish named \"Son-in-Law Egg\", but I think they took it off the menu.  Unfortunately, I was never brave enough to try it... Maybe if you ask they can still prepare it.  Also, they have opened a Goodyear location on Litchfield Rd south of the I-10 for those you out west.  This is great place if you like Thai food, want to introduce someone to Thai cuisine or have a party with people with several different diet/lifestyle choices.",

The freshest and most authentic Thai in my opinion.  And it's BYOB!  This is not a seen and be seen kind of place.  Go to Roka Akor is you are looking for that vibe.  Sala Thai is a little \"mom and pop\" gem where the focus is on delivering delicious Thai cuisine.   The highlights for me are the shrimp pumpkin curry, egg bomb, and larb.  I get an endorphin rush every time I eat those dishes.  As of late we order take out from Sala every 2 weeks and are consistently blown away by how good the food tastes.  I have only 2 issues.    Their servers need to write down the ordered dishes.  Twice now we've had one particular server who has goofed up our order.  Don't mind waiting a bit for the kitchen to expedite a forgotten dish but when you have your 6 yr old and infant in tow you should NOT have to wait 45 min for your kid's dish to arrive (everything else on the table was too spicy).  They did comp us for the dish but I was glad that wasn't my first time in the restaurant or else we would have been robbed of frequenting the best thai place in the valley.      Second issue.  There needs to be some consistency with the heat scale.  Sometimes a \"4\" yields a dish that is only slightly spicy and other times a \"4\" is off the charts too hot.",

Sometimes I spend 10 minutes calling just to get an answer. I give up",

    "text": "*This is a review for PAD THAI ONLY!*  I love Pad Thai, I searched for about 30 min on yelp to find a good Pad Thai place.  I had 3 in mind and they were all pretty close by including this one, but since I wanted to go, I chose this place since it was closest to the highway.  Honestly, the Pad Thai was little disappointing. I'm sure their other foods are great, but probably not the Pad Thai. I'm no expert or a Pad Thai snob, but out of all the ones I had, this might be my worst (or second worst) Pad Thai I've ever had.   The noodles were overcooked, and I was expecting more green onions, but they were only few short ones lying around. They charged 3 extra dollars for 5 fairly good size of shrimps, which wasn't too bad.  They did put a reasonable amount of bean sprouts and slides of carrots, so that was good.  Also, they put a good amount of peanuts (I think it was peanuts), but I chopped up some roasted salted almonds at home and added them for extra taste, which made it little better.  The sauce wasn't too bad, but it would've been better if it was little spicy and saucier (not salty). It was little too bland for me. It almost feels like eating a top ramen at a ramen place, and thinking that I could've just made it at home.  This would be more like a sad Pad Thai that I would probably reuse the leftover to add more stuff or even make spring rolls out of it.  I'm sure the service is good and all, and I have not tried other food since I normally just go for the Pad Thai. And please remember this is a review just for the Pad Thai.  It looked like a family owned place, and I wish and hope the best for them. If you're owner or worker who works there reading this, please .. save the Pad Thai #RIP #PadThai Thank you.",

Here is the reason for the missing star,  They didn't have Pra Ram (you know the chicken with spinach and peanut sauce?)  Well, I really like that dish, and can't frequent a place that doesn't serve it.  So when I am craving curry, this is the place I'll go.  When I want some good Pra Ram, it's back to San Francisco.....",

We did notice that the amount of meat within the dish itself was maybe a little skimpy but didn't think much of it. Then last night we decided to go with a couple of friends to eat there. We spoke so highly of the place and even told our friends that we loved it way more than Thai House on Shea where we had been with them before.   The dishes came and we were blown away. The bowls of Red and Yellow Curry that my wife and 2 friends ordered looked like kid's portions. The amount of food in the bowls was minimal. The amount of meat was again skimpy bordering on non existant. I had the PadThai. The flavor was authentic and delicious. There was only, however, three small pieces of chicken breast and two shrimp.   The issue here is the fact that almost every dish is now around $10 and the portions are too small. For this kind of money, I expect more meat. I am not sure if we will be going back. I would say something, but not too sure if they really would care.",

    "text": "So far, my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix.  I faced a lot of disappointments and mediocrity before I found Thai Lahna and crowned it my valley favorite, but while I have enjoyed consistently good Thai at Thai Lahna, I have never gotten that glorious rush from eating their food.  The first time I tried anything from Sala Thai, my girlfriend ordered me Green Curry to go after dining there with her mother.  When she requested it Thai Hot, the server politely giggled behind her hand.  That curry was the single spiciest thing I have ever eaten.  I am accustomed to spice, but the girl took one bite and promptly ate two slices of bread to cool her esophagus.  I don't know if the spice dispenser malfunctioned, or they felt like messing with us or what, but it was basically a little cardboard trapezoid of napalm.  Even then, the delicate, sweet, earthy, volcanic flavors of their green curry came through.  A week or so later I found an excuse to try a visit to Sala in person.  I am often crippled by extensive menus, I find myself agonizing over the whole concept of \"But what if one of my all-time favorite dishes is on this menu, but I choose the wrong thing and never come back, and my life is .003% less satisfying...\", and the Sala Thai menu features pictures that make everything look delicious.  Ultimately I chose to go with Spicy Eggplant, which is out of character for me, because in trying any new Thai restaurant, my two defaults to establish a barometer are Green Curry and Pad Thai.  If you get those right, I trust you to do everything else.  So my Spicy Eggplant hits the table...you know those moments when food looks so spectacular that you're almost embarassed to defile it by eating it?  That was the case here, and not because it used fancy technique or elaborate chef-driven painting with sauces, but because the produce was so fresh, and the balance of colors so gorgeous, it essentially became some sort of accidental, outsider pop art.   Or something.  The important part is that it was exquisitely delicious.  The eggplant's texture was silky as it should be, the balance of sweet, savory, earthy and spicy was perfect, the rice was the proper consistency..it was what I want Thai food to be.  I have not been to Thailand, I have no close friends or relatives of Thai descent, I haven't read an encyclopedia of Thai cooking.  I only know that my mouth and belly left pleased as they have been by no other Thai place in town, and that is good enough for me.",

The Paid Thai was also off from their usual effort.  As if the Pad Thai sauce was the one I get in a bottle from the Asian market.  Could have been an  off night.",

We were one table of 6 with 2 other tables in the restaurant. The service was very poor. Took 30 minutes to get our drink & food order in, another 50 minutes to get our food. Boyfriend's fried fish plate, once he bit into it, had completely raw fish inside. He asked for a new dish. 20 minutes later they still had not informed us about the whereabouts of his dish. Was his birthday meal and since everyone was about done we asked where his dish was and the server told us \"Oh, they are just about to make it\". We then decided to cancel dish since the meal experience was over. They did not take the dish off of the final check and we had to ask them to remove it bc he didn't get to eat his meal at all nor would it have been with the rest of the family by the time it would have been brought out. Needless to say that the hassle that came along with the meal could have been avoided. Would not recommend if you have a table of 4 or more.",

The duck was prepared surprisingly good and the flavors seemed right. We also had the spicy pumpkin basil with ground chicken. The chicken wasn't that supermarket kind of ground but was more like chopped up well chicken that was moist with some developed flavor and not just cooked and tossed in. The flavors were about right. If I knit pick I can say the dish would have been better if the pumpkin was cooked more because it was slightly crunchy and the basil should have been broken down more instead of being like mini branches of basil. But over all we both were pleased and plan to return.  The decor is very tacky but in a good way. Fake fish swimming in the fish tank. and stuff glued on the walls everywhere. Novelty hugging salt and pepper shakers are for sale for $3.@.",

We sat down and ordered very quickly starting with an appetizer of angel wings (stuffed chicken wings with clear noodles, onion, carrots, and ground chicken).  We then ordered dishes for the seven of us:  two orders of Pa-nang curry, Thai fried rice, drunken noodles with tofu, spicy eggplant with tofu, grilled salmon, and the special (basic leaves duck).  The angel wings were a hit!  The other dishes were for the most part very good.  The eggplant was a little oily though the sauces were great.  The drunken noodles were okay.    As a hint to any Yelp readers, be very careful with the numbers (0-5) of how spicy you would like it.  We all ordered numbers between 1 and 3, and it appeared that those of us who rounded up found our dishes a bit too spicy while those of us who rounded down found the dishes just right.  Sala Thai also allows guests to bring their own bottles of beer or wine (though I do not believe they serve their own though I could be mistaken).    While two of my family members go to Sala Thai on a regular basis, most of the rest of the family had never been there before.  This was my second time and while the restaurant is good, it really didn't stick out as a unique Thai restaurant.  It is definitely worth checking out (as I am sure it is a great restaurant for others).  There is also plenty of parking available outside.",

It was pretty low key for dinner, quiet, 2-3 other parties while we were there. It was a cozy space for sure, we had a nice booth to ourselves. The fish tank full of plastic fish definitely added to the ambiance....  We started with veg egg rolls. Crispy and delicious. We didn't get a chance to ask if the sauce was without fish sauce...we were too hungry to wait for the gal to come around. For the entrees, We had our Thai staples - pad see ew and yellow curry. As always, I added baby corn. The noodle dish was good, however not the best. The Chinese broccoli was a bit too bitter and the flavor was a bit mum -- old nonetheless. The yellow curry - packed with yummy veggies and tofu, was a bit underwhelming. It was also had a tinge of sourness that we didn't enjoy. Could've been our tastebuds a bit off kilter.   Staff was friendly, space was cozy, prices decent. We may or may not visit again, but had a fair experience the first time around.",

The vegetables, tofu, and pumpkin were just right though! Also I usually kind of plow through rice at thai places, but I had quite a bit left over here which was good.

First time trying any place, I try to go conservative because I don't want to necessarily ruin my meal with uber spice.   Let me tell ya, this place does spice/heat right. Just the way I like it. My first time eating here, I got level 4 out of 5, and it was perfect. My daughter got 3 and I tried her noodles, which were spicy still..   Service. Well, as others have mentioned, it's not the most warm and fuzzy service you will get, but will suffice. The food makes up for it.   Portions are smaller here, so you won't feel stuffed nor will an average person have leftovers. My 8 year old was able to finish his plate with no problem.   I noticed on their credit card bill, the preprinted recommended tip only goes up to 15%, whereas usually at other restaurants I see it go at a minimum to 20%.",

We purchase take-out from here regularly and have never had a bad meal.  Some of the stand out dishes include Larb Salad, Angel Wings, Thai BBQ Sausages, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, and Pumpkin Curry.

You really can't go wrong here.  They expanded maybe a year ago, so it's been updated a little, but the place is still small and doesn't look like much from the street (or the strip mall it's' in). Still, the service is always good and fast, and it's BYOB. Don't miss this hidden gem!  PS. I like spicy, but a 2 ther (on a scale of 1-5) is still pretty hot.",

This dish was mostly comprised of noodles!, large chunks of onion and white button mushroom, and bland tofu. It had a side of three sauces, all loaded with sugar. For a much better Thai lettuce wrap, I highly recommend Pei Wei, believe it or not!",

The dishes were well prepared and very tasty.  The service in Phoenix was ok.  It can be a bit difficult to communicate, but not impossible.  Phoenix earns a 4.  Goodyear is an entirely different experience.  I stopped there for lunch recently and was very surprised at the difference.  The young man serving tables was rather clueless.  He did not take orders correctly, missed items ordered, took dishes to the wrong tables, and loudly complained about the kitchen staff to customers.  It was AWFUL!  I wish I could send an email to management, but all they have on their website is phone numbers, and if I called I could end up talking to the person that gave us such a bad experience.  The food was not up to par, and Sala should be embarassed at the 'service'.  This location should get 1 star, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt that this was an isolated incident as I have only been to that location once.  Highly doubt I would try it again.",

    "text": "If you're going to Sala Thai on a Sunday and meeting other people you would do well to remember that there is light traffic on Sunday and you will get here early.  If you get here early, there is a Big Lots down the street where you can spend a few minutes soaking up an almost permeable seedy feeling.  Or not.  I would opt for not.  Or you can do what our dinner partners did and visit a dive bar for a drink.  It's just as well because Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  I'm looking forward to the review on that one, Christine.  No pressure.  I was excited to try Sala Thai after seeing numerous strong reviews.  Overall, they did not disappoint.  We started with pork satay.  We had not seen satay offered in pork.  This was the least satisfying of the selections we had.  The pork was a little chewy and the yellow curry just didn't seem to go well with the pork.  We all shared four entrees.  We had spicy basil fried rice which was delightful and probably my favorite item overall.  I am hoping to have that again soon.  It had a nice balance of spice and fresh basil that was refreshing.  The catfish with panang curry was very nice.  It was the largest catfish fillet I have seen, cooked quickly so as to sear it lightly and some crispiness on the outside while remaining moist and tender inside.  It was heavily sauced and we ordered 4 out of 5 on the spiciness scale.  I think everyone at the table fought off a reflexive sneeze with the first bite of that one.  I would like to see how hot the 5 is, but keep in mind the 4 is pretty hot.  We also had pad thai which for me is a bit of a benchmark dish.  Sala Thai's was unique and very good.  Not overly sweet and with just the faintest hint of smokiness in the pepper flavor, rather complex for pad thai.  Rounding out the tour de Sala Thai was a duck curry with coconut milk, red chili paste, pineapple, basil, tomato and onion.  I'm not a fan of duck but this was very good.  I had several pieces of the duck and plenty of the sauce ladled over my steamed rice.  I recommend Sala Thai.  The sauces were so flavorful that Myles M and I mortified Christine O and Audrey W by licking clean every serving dish on the table.  Not really, but it was close.",

    "text": "I found a good one!  Thanks to the reviews from Josh and Megan, I remembered Sala Thai Restaurant when I was craving thai food for dinner last night.  I wanted to try something new and it worked out well because Sala is located not too far from REI where I was headed to do some holiday shopping.  Sala provided me with a pleasantly full belly and fueled me for my shopping.  When I pulled into the parking lot, Sala was easy to see thanks to the fact that their lighting inside is extremely bright.  They are located next door to a martial arts studio and I could hear the people over there doing their thing a couple of times during my dinner... not necessarily distracting, but enough to make other yelpers aware of!  A friendly thai woman welcomed me when I walked in and told me to sit down where ever I wanted... I took note of her authentic fuschia thai outfit and was pleased with the fact that she followed me over to clean the table thoroughly before I sat down.  As I waited, I took note of some of the thai artwork on the walls and some letters from children - thanking the people at Sala for a 'cultural experience.'  I assumed from this that Sala had hosted some kind of dinner for elementary students and their families; very cool.  The menu is extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order... everything looked really good!  There were several items that I had never seen on a thai menu before such as several entrees with pumpkin and a thai omelet.  That is the problem with dining solo at a thai restaurant - you don't get to share and try different dishes.  I enjoyed looking at the menu and the pictures of select dishes as well.  Please note - Sala Thai does not serve alcohol.  They do offer fresh fruit thai mocktails and thai iced coffee and tea.    After much debate, I went with #10 to start - Thai Salad with Peanut Sauce and #84 - Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp.  I was really happy with the salad; It tasted fresh and included lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrots, onions, and red peppers.  The peanut Sauce was served on the side and it was sweet, creamy, and the perfect sauce to compliment the salad.  I ordered the Eggplant with 'medium' spice.  This was plenty!  I tend to like spice, but next time I may even order mild-medium.  I was happy they served me plenty of white rice to balance the spice of the dish...  Serving sizes were generous and I had leftovers to take home.  I cannot wait to return and try some of the other menu items as well.  This is the perfect place to go on a weeknight if you're in the mood for a casual thai dinner.  Next time, however, I'm bringing friends!",

The rushes here are really random so make sure you give them a call and see how busy they are. If they are busy i would say hold off on going for a little bit. They expanded their restaurant, but the kitchen is the same size and cannot efficiently handle a packed restaurant.   I really recommend getting the fried catfish curry, that literally is the best thing on the menu hands down. I love it soo much. I can't not get this when i go.  I enjoy all their spicy food to rate it a 1 is like peppercorn spice, 3-4 is a mild jalapeno  and 5 is around a spicy jalapeno and serano.   Service is always been good, everyone is polite. The only time when service is slow/bad when the place is getting packed.   This place is where i go when i crave some thai food for sure.",

I told her no because it way too salty.  Since I wasn't sure if it's just a one time thing, I asked if they have a new chef.  She said no and pretty much did nothing about it.

    "text": "Piss poor service! AND  horrible food!  First of all when you walk in the front door- the door was sooo dirty and grimy- gummy- it was so gross. We debated as to weather we should actually go in. When we got inside- it looked clean enough yet there was a weird \"dirty\" smell wafting through the door.  The food might have been just ok- but by the time we actually got it- we were so frustrated we didn't care.   The place wasn't  busy- yet we waited 10 minutes for the server to take our order. She acted like we really screwed up her day by coming in. On top of it- she was a mumbler. Couldn't understand a damn thing she said. We finally ordered the Thai Basil Leaves, Pumpkin Curry with Brown Rice, and the Fresh Spring Rolls to start.  47 minutes later...after others who came in after us were already served and done---  All the food came out together including the starter. Minus the brown rice.  So we started with the Fresh Rolls. They were bland- no basil. By the time we got to the entrees- they were of course cold. Still no brown rice. The server still did not check to see how we were. We finally motioned to her and she said she was busy- and would get it. Busy? WTF?  5 minutes later... we were able to grab the guy who was serving other tables and asked for the rice.  The food was bland and tasteless. And it all had the same flavor- except for the Basil dish. The tofu was burned- see picture. So the whole dish tasted burned. Yuck.  The server never came back to check on us- until she brought the bill. We showed her the tofu- and she said well we have a new chef. My companion said- thats not my problem, I am the customer.\"  The server took the bill back and spoke to the manager supposedly- she came back with 10 percent off the bill. Again WTF! 10 percent is - I guess-is something- but certainly didn't make up for the dumbass server-who tried to blame everything on someone else.   I will never be back- This is one dump!",

    "text": "I have been to Sala Thai many many times. They have always provided wonderful service with exceptional food. Keep in mind, this restaurant is a family owned business; therefore, it has the charm and friendliness of that familial feel. I love the personalities of the staff  and the decor of this restaurant. The staff here are very considerate and pays close attention to your needs as a customer.    Remember they know how Thai food is done. This isn't some corporate chain business or formulated menu that they factory out; the food here tastes AUTHENTIC. Each dish is uniquely created with the appropriate flair of the Thai culture.   I have never had issues communicating or expressing what I want or would like with the staff.   I ordered the tom yum, green curry, fried catfish, phad thai, drunken noodles and even a few of their desserts before. These dishes are all magical.  The tom yum was just the right sour flavor and the herbs really bring out the aroma of this dish. I highly suggest starting off with this savory soup.  Drunken noodles has to be one of my favorites at this restaurant. You can never go wrong with this choice as it brings a variant burst of aromatic flavors. If I order really high level spicy food, I always order a thai tea to go with it. Fun Fact: The milky flavors of this sweet and refreshing beverage actually conteracts the spice flavors. Another great way to enjoy this cuisine; why not blend the flavors?  I can honestly say I will continue to come back again and again; I will even bring friends as I have in the past. Sala Thai has won me over with their delicious authentic dishes, friendly staff and charming atmosphere.   OH and they do take out too!",

The coconut soup was as good as ever!  We also order orange chicken, but were served orange shrimp...not bad, just not what we were expecting.

All the food we tried was pretty good except for the green curry, which had an odd flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It tasted grassy or more medicinal than typical green curry and it was quite watery. We didn't eat much of that, but the veggie fried rice, pad kee mao, eggplant stir fry, Tom yum soup and papaya salad were all okay. The serving portions were very generous and prices are fair. Service was very quick and while our server was a bit forgetful he was friendly and easygoing when we had to remind him about our requests.   I liked the aquarium tank filled with plastic fish. It was a cute, homey touch and honestly more entertaining to watch than real fish.   For dessert, we tried the coconut ice cream, which was a struggle to share, because it was so good. The mango sticky rice on the other hand had rice so hard that it was unpleasant to eat - it felt like it had been left out overnight without being covered. On the other hand, the mango on the rice was perfectly ripe and went well with the ice cream.   Overall, it was a decent Thai dinner, but because of the curry and sticky rice being off, I'm leaving three stars for now.",

    "text": "The first time I went, with friends who knew the owners, the food was great and the service too. The next time less so. The third time, one in our party ordered a dish that wasn't delivered until we were all finished with our meals, and after considerable checking and prodding. Recently we decided to give them one more try when a friend from out of the country was with us. The service was marginal, the food mediocre and once again the meal our foreign friend ordered didn't show up until we complained three times and were finished with our food. The shrimp dish finally showed, was undercooked and lacked any real flavor.   I complained to the guy, is he the owner, manager, head waiter? Hard to say. Just the guy, he said he was sorry and went onto explain that a lot of \"to-go' orders had slowed the BBQ dishes. Like, I guess they can't tell people who are not there that the food will take 30 minutes instead of 20? Whatever. He said he'd discount the final (uneaten) dish and when we went to leave he said he would normally discount the single dish by 10% but that because there was a computer problem, he could only do 5%. Seriously, 5%. I told \"The guy\" this was it for me, he'd lost my business, he said he was sorry, but not making things right for customers is not the way to earn business.  I've really wanted to love this place. It's close to my house and initially the food was good. But the service is dismal at best, and always disorganized. The food is also always inconsistent. Did I mention I saw them cleaning the tables with Pine Sol? Probably not so good to eat anything you drop onto the table...All done here. I won't be back. Not ever. Think twice, there is a lot of good Thai in town.",

    "text": "Ah Sala Thai.. I've seen you grow from a newly opened awkward teenager to the busy mature establishment you are today. I'm lucky enough to live a few blocks from this place. I spotted it a week or so after it first opened and dragged a few friends there. I could tell and mentioned to the group that I knew this place would do well if they could stay a float and get the word out. Only wish I yelped back then so I could have been more help in the process.  When we ate there we were the only ones in the resturaunt. The kitchen at the time was manned soley by the grandmother and one of the daughters was taking orders and busing. Saturday we got in there to a packed house.. got the last open booth within 15 minutes a line formed out the door. The phone was ringing off the hook for pickup orders. The back area of the kitchen had 3 or 4 people in a mad rush turning out food. One of which was still the grandmother :) I was a little sad to see the prices jumped up and the portions went down but there was still plenty of food. The menu had also expanded largely.  What we were lucky enough to eat:  Thai Spring Rolls: Veggies wrapped up in a soft chewy rice wrapper served with a housin/peanut that would make shoe leather taste amazing. All the veggies were very fresh and crunchy which lent a great texture. The mint!! man do I love the fact that these have the crazy contrasting flavor of mint. Thai food is such a celebration of marrying sweet and savory flavors.  Fried Tofu: Quickest way to ruin something semi health is to batter and fry it :) but it is worth it. The crispy coating against the soft warm tofu is a great combination. Also served with that great plum/peanut sauce.  Tom Kha Gai: I've had this soup all over the country, various places in the UK and in New Zealand. Sala Thai and the little place in New Zealand have the best version so far. So spicy from the peppers, sweet from the coconut, intense ginger and lemon grass flavor. Just remembering this dish is what steered me here for my Saturday cheat meal. The soup is filled with large pieces of lemon grass and dried ginger so be cautious. You don't want to chomp down on either of these but I also wouldn't want them to leave it out.  Panang Chicken Curry: My absolute favorite dish of the evening. This curry is made from coconut cream instead of coconut milk. It lends an incredibly rich creamy smooth finish. You have sweet, spicy and creamy. What else could you want from a dish? I've only recently discovered my love for panang I used to do for red, yellow or green but glad I expanded my horizon.  Spicy Pumpkin Curry: This was my buddy Chris' pick. It was a red based curry with large chunks of pumpkin in it. There was a hint of pumpkin flavor but nothing to crazy and not a lot of sweetness. Now I do realize that in America we tend to sugar the heck out of anything with pumpkin but when in season, which we are at the tail end of, have a nice natural sweetness. I would venture to guess canned pumpkin was involved. Not a bad dish but far from my favorite.  Spicy Basil Fried Rice: Reading Jim W's review I decided to give this a try. It was very tasty. The texture of the rice was a bit mushy. The batch of steamed rice they used might have been a bit on the overdone side so the double cooking messed with the texture/consistency. Another great Thai marriage of flavors. Spicy from peppers, sweet from basil and richness from some peanut puree. Chris said it reminded him of pizza a bit, i looked at him funny. I took a few more bites and specifically one with a big piece of basil. I guess I could see it. There was some tomato flavor and the mixture of basil. Maybe a Thai pizza ;)  Pad Thai: Its not that I don't like Pad Thai. I'm just not usually one to order noodle dishes. My dad who is a well seasoned traveler loves this dish and has had it in more countries then I'll likely visit. Many places all over Asia and Thailand. He said this one was very good so I'll have to take his word on it. What I can say is that the noodles were done well. They were not mushy still had a nice bite to them.  Future Solo Meal: Thai Spring Rolls Tom Kha Gai Panang Chicken Curry  This was an A+ night.. with A+ food and B service. You can tell the girls were stressed and were doing the best they could so I can't get to upset at them. I tend to be much more understanding of under staffing at family run places. I would prefer them to run a bit slower then to hire people off the street who have nothing invested in the success of the place.  Pros: Great Food Friendly Staff Interesting Atmosphere  Cons: Slower Service When Busy Very limited seating. They have three tables and all the rest of them are 4 top booths. You are going to have a heck of a time with a group any larger then 4 at this place. They might be able to move a table and expand a booth to seat 7 but at dinner at a normal time your going to be waiting a long while for a booth and table to open up. Bit pricy for the portions",

Sala Thai not only serves up quick, fresh, dependable and competitively priced Thai meals (which come out with a spice rating of 1 to 5 based on your heat tolerance ... 4 is plenty hot), but the servings are such that I always have enough leftovers to bring to work for lunch the next day. Great value. And I put a premium on value. One of the intangible qualities of Sala is that it's become somewhat of a community driver, a third space where you're as likely to run into a neighbor as you are to leave with a full and satisfied stomach.",

On the bright side, the service is good and the food is cooked well, leaving the vegetables firm and tasty.  They have Angel Wings here, and while not handmade they are good. Fresh rolls are very dull, lacking the herbs necessary to bring any fragrance to the food.  There are many other Thai places in the area better than this, we would not go back.",

I love Thai and was a bit concerned about the mixed reviews but wanted to try it for myself. It's in a little strip mall. It's not too crazy busy, seems like most of their business is take-out from our evening. The restaurant is clean and there is plenty of seating. The servers were younger, twin girls that were friendly. Our order was taken and our food was sitting in front of us within 10 minutes. Wow!   The Yellow Curry and Thai Fried Rice w/ Duck were delicious! We also got the mango with sticky rice for dessert. I don't see any issues with our food and it was very reasonably priced.   Only irritating thing was a group of about 7 people in a corner who were on their 5th bottle of wine and were VERY loud. They were more obnoxious than anything and the servers didn't do anything to calm them down - this is where they lost a star. Otherwise, it was a great meal!",

But I wanted a beer, so I brought a single beer, too. That wound up adding another $2.50 for just the beer. That's excessive. I paid $3.25 for a Kiltlifter in Payson earlier today.

We love Thai food and we never really had bad experiences until we tried this place out.  When we entered this place, the waitress escorted us to our table and she told us that they had a party of 15 so she wanted to make sure that we order the food before they do, which was very nice of her telling us about it so we didn't have to wait too long for our food.   I looked at the menu and told my boyfriend that their price is definitely cheaper than other Thai restaurants we have gone so far. But what about their food? My boyfriend said, well... there's only one way to find out! Lol  I ordered Pad Thai with beef, spicy level mild. My boyfriend ordered their Pineapple Fried Rice, same spicy level. When the food came to us, the first thing we noticed was the portion is smaller than other Thai restaurants. Maybe that's why their price is cheaper. I tried my food and I was surprised because it tasted so... weird? For real though, I don't know if that's because they use a thinner noodle for their Pad Thai but I did not like it. And I know I ordered mild for the spicy level but I couldn't taste any spicy whatsoever at all. My boyfriend tried the Pineapple fried rice. There was no pineapple, therefore, it did not taste like Pineapple fried rice supposed to be.  We may come back to try other menu. I hope they can improve their food hopefully next time we will get a better experience.",

My wife loves Thai food (I do not) so here's what she had and her thoughts.  It's a small spot in a strip mall off 32nd st before Shea. The place appeared to be clean and the tables were ready to be used. The waitress told us to choose our own table / booth. The fish tank with fake plastic fish being pushed around by an electric motor circulating them an the water was different but no worries. We ordered in about 5-6 minutes and the food came out in less than 10 minutes.   Coconut Chicken Soup My wife was very excited about this dish. It has coconut milk, tomatoes, chicken, onions, mushrooms, cilantro, basil, a hint of lime & spices. The chicken was well cooked and not rubbery. The dish is definitely big enough for 2. This tasted like home. There was no need to provide extra seasoning and was very good just like it came. She easily gave this a two thumbs up. Grade: A  Veggie Thai Chow Mien  Broccoli, carrots, cabbage, bok choi, noodles and seasoning. She didn't need to add salt or anything else. She ate it just like it came. Her words were, \"the flavors are spread out so well.\" She loved this dish as well. Grade: A   If you're looking for a very good Thai food restaurant and live in the area be sure to try this place. We will definitely be back (well... my wife will).",

I typically share the pad Thai noodles and the curry and we both have plenty. The portions are fairly big, flavorful and most importantly, fresh! I love that you can choose the level of spice on your food as well! The inside is not very spacious with rather tight seating on one side, kitchen in the middle and booth seating on the other side. They do have a larger booth that could fit probably up to 6 people but I wouldn't suggest this place for larger groups. The only reason why I ranked it a 4 instead of a 5 was because the past few times I've been the service has been rather slow. Other than that the food keeps me coming back!",

Next, Nothing we ordered tasted right. My food was cold and BURNT, and my partners was COLD and raw.   We will never come back here as they gave us attitude when we tried to tell them that my partner's food was not cooked. I showed them that my food was actually burnt. And I was given an excuse that they had a new cook in the back. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant where they wouldn't take it back or at least take it off the check. In fact, don't think I've ever even had burnt tofu in my entire life.   In sum, I felt the quality of this place did not deserve the justice of posting anything except poor poor service and poor poor food.",

I wasn't sure what to expect based on the decor here.  I was wrong. Food was in fact very good. I really liked their pineapple fried rice. Their curry spice level 2 has a nice spice to it, really loved the flavor.  Summer rolls were refreshing, great way to start a meal. Mango with sticky rice was just good to finish good lunch.  If I am in the area, I would definitely come back",

    "text": "Very authentic Thai flavors and dishes! While returning from Thailand a few months ago, I had an urge to seek out a good Thai restaurant this weekend. This place hit the spot. There was no wait on a Thursday night and no reservation needed. Quick service and very friendly staff! I ordered three dishes: Crab Wontons, Thai Beef Salad, and Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodles). Crab Wontons were full of Crab Meat and some of the best I've had around! Carrots and a Special Peanut Sauce served with these. Ordered the Thai Beef Salad with a #4 Thai Chili Pepper Index Level and didn't disappoint. Great seasoning and Spices with Broccoli, Cucumber, and Peanuts mixed in. The Drunken Noodles were a #3 on the Thai Chili Pepper Scale. Perfect stir fry with mixed veggies and basil. I Highly Recommend this place if you are in the Paradise Valley/Phoenix area!",

Unfortunately, Sala Thai just seems to not care about quality food or service any more. They just don't care about you, your order or experience with the food they deliver. Consistently, they forget items in your order, when you bring those concerns to the staff they laugh and tell you to wait and rarely rectify the situation. I would highly recommend you order from one of the other 4- star Thai restaurants that come up in the area.",

Service was quick and friendly and the presentation of my dish was beautiful; I took a pic but it didn't save to Yelp. The taste of the pad thai was fine, I did like the thinner noodles but the tofu wasn't flavorful and the spice level was definitely not a 4, I like it to the point where I have trouble breathing and need a break. My drink was okay, there were a few hard boba balls and too much condensed milk/half and half or whatever it is that they use.   I may come back to try different menu items but pad thai is my deciding factor on whether I like a restaurant and they can improve this dish by adding more spice and changing the tofu.",

I'm fine about waiting for my order, but not when my food is sitting and cooling on the counter for over 10 minutes.

I didn't think I was going to get any because I had errands to run on my lunch break, but it just so happened that this place was right down from where I was! I checked yelp before I went in just to be sure it was good. Some places are sketchy. I saw 4+ stars and was super excited.   I normally order some type of garlic entree, but I'm pregnant and have for some reason been craving curry all week! I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and no spice, and it was SO good. Normally with my pregnancy cravings I build something up in my head to be so amazingly delicious and then when I get it, my expectations were way too high and I end up disappointed. But this time, the curry was exactly what I wanted and I was extremely satisfied. It was creamy and had a lot of chicken.   I ordered it to go, and the service was fast and the waiter was very friendly.   My ONLY complaint is they don't have a lunch menu. I was hoping for some lunch special/combo with smaller portions, but they have the same menu all day. The meal was about $10 without a drink and I would have been much happier paying around $6 or $7 and getting smaller portion like at Thai Elephant or Thai Basil does.   Overall, I loved it and if I'm in the area again I will definitely be back.",

Start with one of the soups and move on from there (I recommend the Pork Wonton soup at a level 4 spice)  I hear the curry dishes are fantastic but I can't speak from experience as I tend to go with either Spicy beef with green bean or Thai Basil chicken.  (I'm more of a spicy meat and vegetable guy than a coconut milk guy)  My main tip for this place is for all of you drinkers out there.  If you have a hangover, and you want to cure it -   Step 1.  Get a cab here Step 2. Order the Drunken noodles at a level 4-5 (meat of your preference) Step 3. Don't leave until you've finished it.   Every toxin in your body will steam out of your pores and you will be left feeling amazing afterwards.  (I guess that bottom part is more of a drinking tip and than a Sala Thai tip - but take it if you want it)  Sala Thai is worth the trip.",

    "text": "Not the best Thai food I've had ( the best Thai food I've ever had was in Maui, and it was being cooked out of someone's back yard and sold on the side of the street) but it's pretty good.    I've had their coconut milk soup, pad thai, pad see ew, basil fried rice, green papaya salad, green curry, panang curry and garlic chicken.  All of these are good, although the basil fried rice is a bit too moist and garlic chicken a bit salty for my taste.  Like most other Thai places, the spice level is 1 thru 5 stars.   If you like a good kick, I would say go with 4 stars.  If you like super spicy, skip 5 stars and ask for \"thai hot.\"  I'm a very observant person and to be honest, the many times I've eaten here, I noticed the crowd and they're the type to care about \"ambiance\" and service rather than the actual food.  For me, it's about how good the food is, then I factor in the service and all that stuff.    The service here isn't exactly top notch.  If you're one of those who care about being asked about how you're doing every 10 minutes, then don't come here.    Overall, for the prices and location and quality of food, this place is really good.  I haven't had a dish where I was like, ew!",

    "text": "NOT VERY VEGETARIAN FRIENDLY,  My big problem is thai food revolves around Buddhist food, and Buddhist food is vegan. So when I dont see on the menu vegi options on the curries/ noodles it makes me quite upset.  That Said I found their Pad Thai overly sour (way too much tamarind), but ok. There is a saying for every thai there is a pad thai. Had the tofu and bok choi, (the only vegi option in the curry list) and it was REALLY GOOD. They call it a peanut sauce but it really is a peanut curry, think vietnamese ga sate style. The Pa Nang curry It was good but not \"red\" enough. Talking red curry not just red color. It was very nice but not wow.  The curries also needed more stuff in them (vegetables) and not more bell peppers seriously people.  What was nice was 3 of us left there after 3 entrees and 2 sodas for under $35. The staff was very nice and asked how spicy we wanted things. The menu is a bit daunting so dont be afraid to tell the waiter that you need some more time.  I know that one reviewer stated that nearly any dish can be made vegetarian, which is a duh statement, all they will do is leave something (the meat) out. In-n-out can make you a vegetarian hamburger sure it will just be the bun and the fixins with no patty. My point is that in thai cuisine meat is usually simply an add on but at this place meat is the star of the dish and that is the most wrong perspective.   Top tip for thai restaurant  eating look for a place that list its curries and noodles separate. Now there are other dishes that will always be listed with certain meats as well the dish revolves around that particular meat, but these are the exception in thai food.",

The decor is fun and you must check out the real fake fish fish tank!  No 5 stars because the service was a bit off and there was no option for brown vs white rice.  Will definitely go back when I'm in the neighborhood!",

I decided to take my really good friends for lunch a couple of weeks ago. When we walked it we sat on the newly expanded side.  They had recently doubled in dining space. The food of just okay this time.  I'm not sure if the cook of having an off day or what.  Well while we were eating and chit-chatting away my friend started to get all excited from across the booth telling me to get up and look behind me.  When I did I saw a roach crawling on my seat then scurry away to the next booth.  Okay I tried not to freak out myself and continued our lunch. Then my 7 year old starts to freak out next to me as he notices 2 roaches on the wall next to my friend across the table.  Okay that was it.  My son and friend got up and stood there until our bill came.  Our waitress came out and saw what the excitement was all about but do you think she said anything....of course not.  I assume this must be a normal thing for them now.  Well, needless to say I don't think I'll be returning to Sala Thai.",

These cats cook authentic Thai; i.e., peanut sauce, a staple for the American-gringo palette, was nowhere to be found on ST's extensive menu.   Everything was delicious. BBQ spareribs are bite-size and will be a new favorite. Their Thai Iced Tea is a new addiction (Waiter! IV of Thai Iced Tea!  STAT!  I'm Jonesing! was my cry of the repast.).  Pumpkin Curry was a great veggie accompaniment for the ribs. Fresh Spring Rolls were packed with fresh leafyness of lettuce, cilantro, carrot and delicate rice paper. Lettuce Wraps were terrific.

They should add a liquor license, at least beer and wine but you can byob which is nice too. We live in #thesheaborhood and eat here at least 2x a month. Its a regular go to and in over 10 years has never disappointed. Kudos to Sala Thai.",

I'm back to say that I still love it! The basil friend rice wins awards for a reason, people, but the pineapple fried rice is good, too! However, it is very very spicy. Take the 1-5 scale seriously, I air on the wimpy side. My friend had the spicy pumpkin basil, which was pretty good, too. The menu is extensive, and I'm still perusing!  Everything on the menu can be made vegetarian, just request tofu or no meat. I wish they listed this somewhere on the menu instead of shunning you to the tiny vegetarian corner, which doesn't feature anything spectacular. I got the pad thai and found it a little lackluster.   The boba is wonderful, and wonderfully huge. I enjoyed the taro last time!",

    "text": "TL;DR version: - Red Curry was WAYY over-salted. I usually enjoy salty food, but it was over the top. - After explaining I deal with severe allergies (namely onions and peas) the server listed all the vegetables to ensure nothing was included that I couldn't have. She said they could leave off the onions. The dish came out FILLED with snow peas, which yes, are still peas. It also had a huge leek in it despite explaining the severity of my onion allergy. - She offered to remake the dish, but I had zero confidence in their ability to make it without allergens, so I declined. They DIDN'T remove it from the bill.  We will never be going back here again. The whole experience was super disappointing and I will have to deal with an allergic reaction for 2-3 weeks because of their carelessness. If you also have food allergies or enjoy low blood pressure (aka not having ridiculously over-salted food), go elsewhere.",

Best of New Times.  Inside is both fun and inviting with some really comfortable booths. One is right next to a very cool looking fish tank with a lot of eye catching activity. Those crazy little critters are really flying and bouncing all over the place. The wife has to remind me that they are plastic fish and not to get too excited. Ha!  Nice selection of all your Thai restaurant favorites and more. They even have pictures on the menu of several dishes. This is always good when you are wanting to try something new and feel shy.  Like to order my dishes Thai SPICY Hot. The family members just laugh and prefer it more in the Medium range. You can always ask them to bring out more chilies if you want to start off with Mild and work your way up.  Some of our favorites are the Tom Yum (Hot and Sour), Tom Kra Gai (Chicken Coconut Milk) Soups. The Appetizers are all really good as well as any of the Noodle dishes, the different colored Curries, the Spicy Garlic versions, and the many BBQ items.  Bring the crew and ask for Thai Spicy if you dare. It is hotter than the 1-5 scale. Located in a small strip mall and easy to drive right past. SIMPLY YUMTACULAR!",

    "text": "I would not even give them a 1 star, but then I wouldn't be able to write this. We saw the reviews on \"Check Please\",  and decided to hit it on the way home from my wife's job. Having a total of 75 years experience between the two of us in the restaurant and hospitality business, we were very disappointed. We contemplated leaving but decided to stay.Arrived Saturday at 6 pm. We checked in for a table, there were 4 open inside. Only waited a couple minutes because they had dirty plates and had to wipe and clean. The hostess brought us to the table and then left. We sat waiting for a server for 18 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. We put a order in for 2 sodas. We didn't receive any beverages that we ordered, including water from the time we satdown, was 38 minutes. When the server did bring soda, she only brought one. Huh? Other diners next to us were seated and brought water for each person. After we finally caught a server, I asked about my soda and she replied that they ranout of clean glasses. Kinda strange because considering the soda and water were the same glasses. When the server finally came to our table, after my my wife went up to tell someone we were ready to order, which was 53 minutes since we were seated, she didn't even mention any of the specials. We decided to order appetizer, food and desert all at once so we could get our food. Watching the front door get filled with a line of people, we noticed a large amount was to go food. The number of To Go Orders had to have come after we were seated. It seemed like the To Go Orders were more important then the customers seated inside. More food To Go was going out then inside. When the server brought food, she only brought chicken skewers. At least we had something. When we tried it, it was cold. Hey we are really trying here. Our food finally arrived. Mine first, then my wife's 5 minutes later. She ordered curry and never received the rice to go along with it. We flagged down a server and she brought the rice. So much confusion. I had the Pahd Thai shrimp with extra shrimp. When meal came, I ate the shrimp, and counted each shell on a plate totally 9 pieces total. Being a big guy and a big eater, if I buy it I will eat it.  I couldn't even eat half of my meal. Something was not right. I had my wife try my dish and she said it was off too, so it wasn't just my taste buds. Not seeing a server in a long time, my wife decided to go up and try and get a soda refill. She did say the owner was nice. We we were finished with meal and waited for our sticky rice which never came so my wife went to check on it. They said 10 minutes which turned into 20 minutes. So sad. The diners next to us who came in 35 minutes after us got check and were out before us. Since server didn't check on us, I asked her for the check. It came 15 minutes later. By the way , my meal was $10 and the 4 pieces of extra shrimp were $9. I should've bought another entree because I would've got noodles too for a $1 more. C'mon, really? All said and done, it was a total of 1 hour and 28 minutes of HELL. 2 Thumbs down. I have never been so disappointed in restaurant ever. And I go out alot. I do Consulting for restaurants for those who ask for help. My advice from sitting 2 tables from restrooms in back is; You need a designated busser. You need food runners. You need a hostess, not a server seating customers. You need a designated Phone / To Go person, not a server who should be taking care of Guest and their food. Your place should have 1 server on one side and one server on other and one for outside. You need to have Cooks make food in order it comes in, not To Go food first. Your Big Impression is for the Guests inside. First timers like Me. Then I will order food To Go next time. For being the size you are, there is to much Chaos. Time Management Problem.",

    "text": "I didn't know what to expect when I walked into Sala Thai, but I was pleasantly surprised with the traditional Thai decoration. There were definitely lots to look at - the walls and the counters were filled with decorations. I personally didn't understand the point of a \"fish tank\" with plastic fish floating around, contrary to the others that seem to love it - I guess it just depends on taste.  We were seated, and were given plenty of time to look over their extensive menu.   I ordered the Chicken Barbecue plate and my sister ordered the curry. For the chicken barbecue, the presentation of the food was great, but the taste of the food was okay at best - the chicken was a bit tough to chew on. It really wasn't my favorite. The curry was better - it had a thick coconut aftertaste which I enjoyed. I would recommend the curry rather than the barbecue.   The reason why I gave this place three stars was because of the service. The waiters were never 'rude' per say, but they just seemed non-existent! They might as well make this place a self-serve restaurant because the waiter gave us the food but never checked in once. My sister and I were tired and in need of water because we came from walking in the heat but our waters were never refilled. My sister wanted more rice for her curry but no one came by to check up on us. It seemed like the waiters didn't put any effort to attending us other than taking our order and dropping off the food. Additionally, we were ready to leave for a while before they arrived with the check.",

In addition to traditional Thai offerings, the menu also contains a few Chinese dishes in case your party is not 100% onboard with Thai. Yes, it's a small restaurant with occasional small restaurant issues, but the presentation of the food is often consistent with a much more expensive destination. And the decor!

I wasn't crazy about the pad thai but loved the Drunken Noodles and would definitely order again. We both also got the coffee frozen drink. (They offer many different flavored \"Mocktails\" and it was very good).   The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the service. It was friendly, but I had to ask for things a couple times before I got them. Not a big deal but the reason why I withheld a star. I would recommend the food and will be back.",

    "text": "Fantastic little neighborhood Thai restaurant. We're all about the Pumpkin Curry, but Sala Thai has a lot more than one dish to offer.   The atmosphere. It's intimate, with pretty much every square inch of wall space filled with kitschy artwork and memorabilia.  The napkins. Neatly folded in birdlike form with a fork inserted.  The presentation. Food is served in a manner consistent with a much more expensive restaurant.  The menu. Pumpkin Curry! What more need be said?  In all seriousness. I love the food. There is plenty of variety on the menu. Those in search of heat will find it. Those not can find safe refuge. Servers routinely ask for your heat preference on a scale of one to five, with five being hottest. Keep in mind it's an Asian scale. I'd suggest you go no higher than a three, my preference, even it you like your food spicy. Go higher at your own risk.  They will ask you to pay in cash if possible. We paid with a credit card on our most recent visit, without problem or comment. It's just a small business understandably trying to avoid high credit card fees. I'm fine with that if it helps keep their prices reasonable.",

We were able to pick our seats so we sat next to the big fish tank full of little plastic fishies. Cute. Our forks and napkin were decoratively wrapped together...also a nice touch.  We ordered some of the veggie egg rolls to start. They were pretty good, very crisper and hot. For our entrees we both ordered drunken noodles, me beef and my son chicken. I had my heat at a level 3 but my son ordered a level 4. My dish was pretty good with some heat but not enough to overtake the flavor of the food. I can tell my son's food was hot, I could see it on his face, but he enjoyed his as well.   Overall, this is a good local place to grab some Thai food. Friendly staff, and not too pricey.",

So I perused their expansive menu and saw about 10 things I thought might be really good! Decided to try something off-the-wall with the thai omelette; meat, peas, carrots, and glass noddles inside egg? Why not!?  It was really quite good and did a great job of bringing me out my funk without trying to bowl me over.  The place was a small strip-mall location, but it was busy when there wasn't anyone in sight at the places around it. I'm not a Thai food connousieur, so I can't vouch for the authenticity. All I know is I had a good meal for a reasonable price and I'll go to bed happy knowing that I have a new dinner option nearby.",

We brought our own bottle of wine, which was cool, and we shared the chicken lettuce wraps, which were awesome and came with three good sauces. It was a notably large portion for an appetizer and could easily be shared by 3-4 people. For dinner, I ordered the green curry with chicken and brown rice, on a 4 (out of 5) spice level. It was very spicy, as I was hoping for, and I admire anyone with the courage to order the 5. Everything was cooked nicely, all of the right flavors were there, and it was amongst the best green curries I've ever tried. I was able to snag a bite of the duck curry (which was in an orange-colored sauce which included pineapple [yummmm]) and a seafood special, which contained shrimp, scallops, catfish and a variety of vegetables. All three entrees were delicious and exceeded my expectations! As far as service went, the waiters were very friendly and attentive. The ambiance was very nice and, overall, it was a five star experience for a reasonably priced Thai restaurant. I definitely recommend swinging by if you're craving a mean green curry!",

When we got there, there seemed to be plenty of seating and the waitress seemed quite accommodating.  We ordered a ton of food including Tom Yum soup,pad Thai, pad Sui,  curry chicken, BBQ beef, and pineapple fried rice.  Like I said earlier, I'm not a huge fan of curry but i did try some and I liked it more than I normally do.  I did not however try the Tom Yum soup just because I don't like it in general.  The pad Thai and pad Sui (spelling?) was OK,  but I feel like I've had better.  What I did love however was the pineapple fried rice and BBQ beef.  I could not get enough of it!  I almost finished the entire serving of fried rice by itself.    So to sum up my review, if you are a fan of Thai food, I think you will enjoy it a lot (my sister swears by it and spent a year in Thailand). However,  I'm just not a huge fan of Thai food, and although they do offer a lot of neutral plates (BBQ plates come to mind), their specialty items I find are lacking.",

Ended up going to Sala because of all the reviews. Have to say - we all loved it!  We got their basil fried rice based on the reviews - and it was awesome.  We also ordered the drunken noodles, the spicy basil leaves with soft tofu and another with chicken (minced).  Everything was delicious!  In fact, between the 3 of us, we finished almost everything.  Kind of ridiculous.  Also, 4 out of 5 (spicy level) was perfect.  We love spicy food and it was the perfect amount of heat.  I would equate it to medium spicy in NYC Thai restaurants, which is really quite spicy but perfect if you can handle heat.  Oh, and not sure about peoples' tastes but we don't love sugar in our Thai food - so if you're the same, be sure to let them know not to add extra sugar.  We forgot to do that and although some dishes were a tad sweet(er), we didn't particularly mind because of the heat.  Still, next time, I would say no sugar.  Also, we ordered the coconut ice cream for dessert and it was great.  Subtle coconut flavor (not too essence-y) topped with toasted coconut.  Alsooo, the servers were really nice.  We arrived at like 8:45pm and despite closing at 9pm (kitchen closes), our server was super sweet.  Would definitely go back to Sala Thai if we're ever in the area again!!!!",

    "text": "This is one of those rare reviews I will write that SG does not agree. We typically feel the same way on restaurants and the food. I actually think he would give this place a 4 or 4 1/2. That being said, I am writing my review and you will get my perspective. He's on his own.  Staying in Scottsdale, we found ourselves not having to have dinner with the crew. YA, no bar food. This was our opportunity to have good food of our choice without having to deal with all those guys. So, yelp on the mission to find something not too far from our resort with good ratings. Sala Thai came up fairly highly ranked and pretty darn close (and open a bit later on a weeknight, as it was around 8pm).  This place is in a little strip mall, small and hard to find if you are not looking for a store front. Someone had made reference to it in their review, so we did not have much trouble. We pulled on in and walked in to be seated. The place has lots of greenery and Thai decorations. All the seating appeared to be in booths though there may have been a table or two toward the back. There were quite a few people here as well, but we were seated right away.   The menus have lots of pictures and some very creative drink options. We ordered a slushy thai tea to share and continued to look at the menu. There were quite a few creative Thai dishes that you do not see other places and we decided that we would stray just a little from our norm. I was dead set on papaya salad, since I felt I needed some fruit after all the bar food I had been eating. We also ordered pad see ew beef and pumpkin chicken.   The drink took forever to come. I think there may have been only one person in the back cooking, though there were two young people hostessing and taking orders. The food arrived close to the same time as the drink. The papaya salad, though we ordered medium spicy, was HOT HOT HOT. We were both dying. We usually can tolerate spicy, but this was almost too hot to eat. We did not even finish what was on the plate and typically I would eat that more than the other stuff. The Pad see ew  was ok, not as good as would have liked. Just not as flavorful. The pumpkin chicken was good. Different. I picked out and ate most of the pumpkin.   I just felt very unsatisfied by the meal. The food was just ok. I have had so much good Thai food that this one just did not live up to my standards. So much for a good non-bar food night. But at least the Thai tea was great, once it came. Maybe we just did not order the right stuff and should have ordered mild on the spice for the papaya salad. I am sure there are other Thai places in the area, so I will likely not go back (even if SG voted to go back).",

    "text": "All around a good Thai restaurant! The food was really delicious. I had what I always get at Thai places... Yellow curry with chicken. no beer at this restaurant but yet their open close sign is sponsored by a Thai beer called Chang, which is a really great beer must try. My only gripe was the service. They were nice enough but the service was awkward. They would ask you a question and walk away before you could answer. Usually I would blame that on how busy it was but... We were the only people in the shop. Again, over all a great place to eat and I recommended it if your in the area.",

    "text": "Every Thai place I always get the same item(at least once). That makes comparing much easier. I always get the Spicy Basil w/Tofu and brown rice(if you don't have brown rice then you get deducted at least a star and DON'T tell me brown rice and white rice are nutritionally the same, really? Read a book! ). Sometimes I throw on a side of steam Broccoli for good measure but not always. Sala is the closest decent Thai place to where we currently live so I would say we frequent Sala more then any other Thai place in the Valley.  We get take out 50% of the time and eat in the other times. Only once can I think of that the order was jacked up at all(no brown rice). Usually service is quick and no hassle. Food is quite consistent, sometimes the vegetables on the dish change, but it's always a surprise and works so why not!  They have the typical decent veg/vegan selection and will do a fish sauce replacement(plum I think) if you ask. My only minor complaint is that sometimes the heat level is not consistent, I like it HOT but Thai Hot some places is HOTTTTT, other places its just mild. Usually if I ask for hot, it's a good level but sometimes it is off(usually weak).   I won't say it's my favorite Thai place in the valley but it is in the top 3 for sure (at least top 5...yeah top 5) and I have given them plenty of times to disappoint.",

Ok I ve been back and the food was tremendous I not sure maybe I had an off night last time. Awesome flavors, authentic spices. I highly recommend Sala Thai.",

    "text": "The 2 of us went to Sala Thai last night and expected so much better based on these reviews on yelp. We looked at the menu on line and knew the prices were high and thought they must be good at those prices.   Ok the Thai Tea will get a high rating for sure.  The place was busy. The booth seating was comfortable and the fish tank with the plastic fish was interesting. The hangings on the walls were pretty.  But the reason we were here was to try a different Thai Restaurant. Once we ordered our food it came out too fast. It must have already been cooked. The Beef Panang had no flavor and the sauce was too thin.  The beef in it was tough and had stringy bits as well. The toughness made me think microwave. But I have no fact about that. The broccoli floating in the Panang sauce tasted good. The Pad Thai seemed to be a glued tangled mess of various size noodles. It was loaded with fried egg. No flavor.  The Stuffed angel wings were huge and not sure what the stuffing was as we couldn't identify it.  A bit of a freezer taste. Hot on outside but not warm in the middle. The cover up flavor came from the sweet chili sauce we poured over it. We had to ask for more sauce.  No one ever came to see how our food was until the end when they brought the check. Yet we were still eating or trying to when they brought the check.  We left so much food on our plates and paid $37.00 and left. We have been eating Thai Food for over 25 years in the Valley and do have our favorite places. However , living  North of the main city, there are not a lot of Thai Restaurants to choose from. We have to make a 35 minute drive to get to one. We will not return to Sala.  We will not go back there.",

    "text": "So glad to have found great Thai in my neighborhood.  We thought when we moved away from Tempe that we had lost our access to great ethnic food.  Luckily we found this little gem.  Great ambience, friendly quick service, and fantastic food.  We ordered the green curry chicken and the drunken noodles with vegetables.  Great sized portions for reasonable price.  We got ours on a 3 out of 5 scale of heat and it was perfect for us.  I have a feeling we'll become regulars.",

All of their meals are great.  Love the Spicy Basil and Drunken Noodles.  Their soups are great too!  The staff is always friendly.  Great place!!!!!!",
