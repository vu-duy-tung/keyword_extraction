The fish tacos were pricey, not a problem for me if they were worth it. BUT my fish (mahi) was dry and hard and nothing can save it. Seriously it was hard.  Service was great and fast, but I can't really get over how hard the fish was and frankly I couldn't taste the flavoring they added to it. Ugh",

Fresh, large and definitely a great combo of ingredients. We also had the Mahi Mahi fish and chips - pretty darn yummy as well. The restaurant is very casual, not much to the counter/seating, almost looks like a temporary set up. I was especially impressed that there was a baby changing table built into the women's bathroom wall (so you know it wasn't put in later). I know, it's a weird thing to notice, but I appreciated that the owners had the forethought to think about their customers. The only cons are the seating. The tables are round tops and surfboard shaped longs. There is not enough room to put everything! It felt very crowded. All in all would return :).",

    "text": "I'm gonna hop on the bandwagon here to say that the fish tacos aren't all that. It's half Mexican half Hawaiian so way too many flavors are happening. They don't tell you what's in the taco on the menu so if you don't like wasabi, don't get the coleslaw on top! A wasabi coleslaw, on a fish taco?! Yuck! A white corner tortilla, Mexican cheese blend and some blended pico de gallo start the bottom of the taco. Then the EXTREMELY flavorless fish fills the middle. You can't even fit this tiny thing in your mouth because of the mango and coleslaw and tomato immediately fall off and onto plate. Seriously this is not the best fish taco..not even close. Only reason this is getting a 3 star review is because they kindly made me a new taco with lettuce instead of the coleslaw but it didn't make it any better.. Plus..our order was brought out to us in less than 5 minutes. Some may think that's great but that just shows me they do not freshly prepare their foods or care about the structure and presentation of the food. Refrigerated and pre-prepared ingredients 100%. The fish is most likely kept in a warmer all day.",

Fish tacos: Salt pepper seasoned DRY DRY fish with tons of cabbage some mango and other fixings. Overall flavor was mild mayonnaise sweet. No pop of flavors or interesting flavor profile. Absolutely a waste of $11(or something like that). Seriously, I have had better tacos at Rubio's..they are not very fancy but they always hit the spot and have tons of flavor. Their salsa bar is absolutely fantastic as well and it costs much less. I don't know why people have given their fish tacos such good ratings. Tacos are HUGE though.  Fish Taco Mountain : Again the same sweet flavor profile and again very dry fish with tons of cabbage. Nothing interesting or worth the money. What a waste of money and Friday night appetite.  Would not go back for more disappointment. Ordered a take out so cannot comment on the service. They would not prepare blackened or cajun fish for your taco or any taco related order. They are pretty firm on serving you their boring recipe.",

The sauce that comes on it is weird and the side of slaw has no flavor tastes like you are just eating cabbage. The fish and chips, well the fish part was good but the chips were fries not thick cut fries like British chips are suppose to be, also they were not crisp. The tarter sauce that comes with it is more of a dill sauce. Over all the place is overly priced and just ok tasting. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars, it leaves a lot to be desired.",

Others in our party had the coconut shrimp and steak tacos.  We all agreed that it was \"ok\".    That said, I wanted to be bowled over.  But I can only say that the tiny bits of fish were a bit dry and overcooked and thus \"ok\".  The toppings are unique and flavorful but not enough flavor to contribute to the rest of the ingredients (rice was bland). The coconut shrimp was ok and a decent price.  Steak tacos were probably the best of the bunch.  Yet not enough to bring us back.    A table next to us had the Poke and it looked wonderful.  I'd try that if we ever go back.  I'm so sad.  I wanted this to be a nice neighborhood go-to place.  The search continues.",

While the tacos weren't terrible, the slaw on top tasted like little more than mayo - completely killed the flavor of the fish - and the fish was tough. The theme as cool, though. Great artwork and such. I will go elsewhere for my fish taco fix in the future, though. Bummer. Certainly not worth the $10.99 for 2 small tacos.",

I had heard good things about this restaurant from a friend and wanted to try it out. Fortunately, I walked away from dinner a happy camper.  We ate out on the patio. It's a good thing I watched what other people were doing while we were sitting there; otherwise, it would have been a long wait. You order at the cashier's, then they bring the food to you. We were told to try the fish tacos, their signature dish, and were very pleased. The serving was generous, the fish was fresh, and it stood out among the many fish tacos we have had.  We also ordered the grilled macadamia-crusted mahi on a salad. While the fish portion could have been larger, the price was right and, as with the tacos, the fish was fresh. The salad also included several shrimps, and while they were a bit salty, they were a welcome addition to the salad.  We will definitely be back!",

I had the fish tacos, and what I got was NOT a taco but a pile of soggy vegetables with a few very small pieces of dry fish, and tacos that were stale and hard except where the vegetables piled on top of them had made them gooey. You're supposed to be able to pick up a taco and eat it with your hands (\"A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling\")....NOT these things, whatever they are!  I ate about half of one taco (they serve two per order) and I simply quit....not good at all and way too hot!  My wife had the fish and chips and ate a couple of bites of the fish and couldn't eat any more - the breading had a funky taste.  Moreover the place has no ambience at all - very small and noisy, and our table was sticky - had to clean it myself!  Well, at least my curiosity is satisfied, though I have no idea what the folks who give this place 5 stars are comparing it to.",

    "text": "Since trying Coconut's Fish Cafe, I go almost every other week. The first time, like most first-timers, they sold me on the fish tacos. These tacos are massive, not wimpy-shrimpy tacos. It was a filling meal. However, I would not rate this place solely on this dish, though it does get a lot of attention.  On my second trip, I wanted to try a few of the appetizers. The calamari were good, but the coconut shrimp was incredible. It tasted almost like too much of a \"treat\" to not be a dessert, the shrimp were good size and the coconut flavor was rich and expansive.  On my third visit, and now for every subsequent visit, I stick to my favorite dish: Blackened mahi-mahi \"local style\", served with brown rice and slaw. It is an incredible, perfect-sized health dish for a hungry patron during lunch or dinner. The only thing that kind of weirds me out is that the dish is served with a tomato slice with shredded cheese on top, maybe it's a traditional thing but I didn't find anything on Google. At any rate, if you don't want it they are happy to not include it with your meal.  The staff are always attentive, immediately after my food arrives I am set up with napkins and silverware (and a bottle of Tiger sauce, now that they know I love it) and even when busy the staff make it a priority to ensure everyone is enjoying their meal.  Last but not least, the store is always EXCEPTIONALLY clean. Condiments are always filled, bottles are clean (I hate when you grab a condiment and get leftover on your hand, gross!) and there isn't a speck of dust or food whenever I sit down. Bathrooms are exceptional too!  TL:DR: Coconut's on Shea and Scottsdale is fantastic, but if you've only tried the fish tacos and were not impressed, give something else a shot!",

We ordered a dish for my son, paid the bill and had our food delivered.  They didn't bring my son's food out and a toddler was forced to wait while the rest of us had food.  You would think for the inconvenience that they would comp a $4 kids macaroni and cheese, but no.  Out comes the cashier with a receipt to take our card.  No apologies...just we forgot to charge you so you'll have to pay.  I guess that's what happens when you have teens running the joint.    Based on our experience, I would not return.",

Recommended. Very casual ambience--order at the counter. One fish taco order has 2 big tacos, enough to feed 2.",

They have plenty of seating inside and a nice patio outside. I will return again soon I'm sure.",

    "text": "I usually come to Yelp to write positive reviews, however, I  went to Coconut's last night and I had to write a review out of frustration. I ordered a bowl of the chowder. I love all kinds of chowder and order it out often. It was not thick and creamy like most chowders, but more a watery base. That's not why I'm writing the review though. When ordering I asked if we could substitute the little side of coleslaw for something else since neither of us like coleslaw. The person helping us said she couldn't. Then I asked if I was able to order one taco and she said we can't do that. Lastly in trying to order, I asked if I could get one fish taco and 1 of another kind she said they can't do that, that they portion the meat in advance and it wouldn't work. I think coconuts needs to take some lessons from Chick-fil-A, In and Out Burger , even McDonald's. I've never been to a restaurant that was so un-accomodating to the customer. Give me a break that you can't do one taco or have one fish and one chicken. Very negative experience. I will say the guy that came to clear our plates was very nice and considerate.",

It is not a full service restaurant: you walk up to a counter where an employee explains the menu including food and beverages. It does take plastic.  Nonalcoholic drinks are self serve.  Beer and wine are available.  When your food is ready, it is delivered.  My wife got the fish tacos and declared them 5 star. I got coconut shrimp as a meal and thought they were three star, very greasy and low flavor. It included fries and rice. A friend got baked fish on rice and was happy enough.  Service was adequate for meal delivery and dish pickup so I tipped about 11%.",

    "text": "Best Fish Tacos in Town hands down! I've eaten here a few times now and they have been equally fabulous every time. The grilled Mahi mahi that they use is extremely fresh and never even a hint of fishy taste to them. Actually I'm pretty sure people that don't like  fish would even approve of the Mahi mahi that they serve here. In addition to the fish the taco is topped wi an amazing coleslaw mixture and a deliciously refreshing mango salsa that just sets it off. The staff is always very friendly, and the restaurant is always very clean and super contemporary. Theres no wait staff so you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you on a real plate which makes it great if your in a hurry but don't want the fast food experience. Plus they pick up after you. It's such an awesome place and Ive been telling all of my clients about it since I work right across the street. Also the coconut shrimp is really good too but just make sure your hungry. The tacos come in an order of 2 which I was skeptical at first since I'm a Big eater but their HUGE and fill me up every time. I love this place and can't wait to take my friends and family here.",

    "text": "Fish tacos are fantastic. My people are island people, so when we found out that these tacos had ripe and tasty chunks of mango on our fish tacos, we went bananas. Or should I say...mangoes ;) (Yeah, I went there.) The fish quality was fresh and didn't taste like a frozen TV dinner like some other fish taco places I've been to in the past. I was surprised by the size of the taco, since I'm accustomed to having street taco-sized tacos throughout Phoenix. Come with a solid appetite as they are quite filling. The taco mountain (Fish, mangoes, veggies, on top of rice) was also good, but I highly recommend sharing this with another person because it is certainly a lot of food for riding solo.  Which I did, 'cause I'm such a genius. (Well, at least I owned myself, so now you don't have to).",

Until now - when I learned that Coconut's opened in Scottsdale, Arizona of all places.  One bite and I was transported back to Maui.  Warm soft tacos, fresh fish, tropical fruit flavors with the right balance of savory-sweet.  The other people in my party (including locals) were bowled over and swore they'd be back soon.  The staff are friendly, helpful, and smiling.  I'd give six stars if I could!",

The sauce with the shrimp was really the wow factor that gave it some individuality. The burger was good as well, with a nice piece of fish. The fish slightly over cooked but nice flavor. The fries were crisp and yummy. Sadly, the reason I'm not more generous with the stars was the unhelpful obviously uninterested cashier at the register. We came in on a Saturday where several other restaurants were hopping with customers. Coconuts a two tables of couples. We were greeted by a young lady that was standing with her arms folded gazing out the window. I get it...we all have our Down Time. But once I stated how excited we were to be here our first time there as no attempt to educate us about the menu or possible preparation options. We made our selections quickly cause I felt we were inconveniencing her with our lack of knowledge on the menu. Once we got our food the evening improved! We dined outside and enjoyed people watching! The gentleman that was attending the outdoor tables was a dramatic difference to the young lady in the restaurant. My pet peeve is service!

Fried shrimp were nothing special, just plain old fried shrimp.  Service was good, all the staff were accommodating and pleasant.",

    "text": "Ate here for the first time last night with my dad and stepmom; we really dug this place! Although their fish selection was surprisingly limited, they were all GREAT healthy options (and could be prepared a bunch of different ways, e.g. Cajun, blackened, Asian style, etc.): mahi mahi, ahi tuna, and ono (otherwise known as wahoo, a really good mackerel-tasting type of fish). Everything was fresh, flavorful & served quickly! I got the ono (prepared South of the Border Style), with brown rice & steamed veggies; my dad also got the ono (prepared with butter, salt & lemon), with steamed veggies & Hawaiian 'cole slaw'; stepmom had the grilled shrimp and panko-crusted shrimp plus steamed veggies, plus a glass of Oyster Bay White Wine (which she also really liked). Anyways, we had a real good experience here--not just with the food but also with the cozy, happy and laid-back island vibe of the place (cute little surf board-shaped tables, surfing videos playing on the flat screen TV, reggae & Hawaiian tunes playing overhead, great service,  and a young, good-looking, efficient and upbeat staff! We could easily see why this place is so popular and why it quickly filled up quickly the entire time we were here (we barely got a table--which luckily, was able to accommodate my dad's wheelchair, since it's a bit cramped inside and plus, it was too cold to sit in their outdoor dining area). But anyways, I'm 99.9 % sure we would definitely come back!!",

Mahi Mahi was outstanding, and the fish tacos are ridiculously good. So much so, that I went back for more (of both) the next night. Oh, and the second night I tried the Taro chips which were delicious. I couldn't tell you even one of the 17 ingredients in the fish tacos, but it doesn't matter, they are off the chart!

The macadamia nut Mahi platter was amazing. The fish was fresh, it was cooked to perfection and the combination of the nut crust and the salsa was tropical paradise. The tacos were delicious as well, the tortillas were fresh and did not break apart on you when attempting to eat your over stuffed taco.

This place has hands down the best fish tacos I've had anywhere in AZ. And they are HUGE! You get two in an order and boy are they filling and worth every penny. The fish is topped with slaw, some sort of mango salsa, plus a special sauce. I hardly know how to describe it. SO good.   The menu may not be huge but trust me, what items they do have are done right. The appetizers are amazing too. The coconut shrimp are the best coconut shrimp I have ever had. Truly jumbo size (not a tiny piece of shrimp with 4x the breading trying to masquerade as a jump shrimp here) and the coconut breading is to die for.   The location is clean and the staff always incredibly friendly. Even if I sit outside they have someone regularly popping out to clean tables and check on everyone. It may be a casual atmosphere, you order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table, but the service is not lacking in any way.   Great lunch place and one of my favorites in the area.",

Nothing makes me happier than good food and coconut's fish cafe made me happy.   The coleslaw wasn't your typical coleslaw. I don't know if it was the cabbage but I almost tasted a hint of wasabi.

Yes, I would drive from the airport to the little strip mall that houses the first one. And than back to airport on my way home.  The fish tacos are off the charts, hands down the best I have ever had anywhere. I agree with CNN AS One of the Best in the world. I wish they sold the tacos by eachs, 2 is good, 4 is to much.  However you should also try the other food!! The fish sandwiches are also iconic!!     I cannot wait for their global domination. It's that good.  Yes the locals eat there.",

I waited about 8 minutes and my order was brought out to me.  The fish and chips were very hot. I squeezed some of the lemon over it, and put some malted vinegar on it, I then dipped my fish in the tartar sauce. It was so yummy. The fish was crispy and tasty. There was enough for two people, so my husband and I shared the fish and chips.  The restaurant has a nice select of shrimp, fish, and calamari dishes. I found the prices to be reasonable. The restaurant is clean and the decor is in the Hawaiian theme with a television in the corner showing surfing, underwater sea life and people in the water in Hawaii.  **The restaurant gives a military discount as well.** We will definitely be back to this location.",

    "text": "If you can't go to Maui for a fish taco, go to Coconuts! The order is two generously-sized grilled fish tacos. I expected the fish to be grilled, but the corn tortillas? Oh my! The tacos are grilled, just lightly browning the tortillas. Their coleslaw is fantastic! Not too sweet, with a lot of great crunch! That yummy coleslaw comes on the taco, along with tomato salsa, and mango salsa. As I said, the tacos are generous and I ate all the deliciousness out of the second taco, sadly leaving those toasty tortillas behind.  I will definitely be back. The food in and of itself would do that. But, the friendly staff makes it even better. As this was my first time, the cashier gave me several suggestions. But, I decided to start with those Zagat-rated Best fish tacos. But, there are several things on the menu to accommodate every fish lover's palate.  This is not a sit down and order restaurant. You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table. So, it's definitely a casual dining experience. At least twice I was asked by an employee how my meal was and if I needed anything while I ate on their good-sized outdoor patio.  What a find! Check it out! Unless you are lucky enough to be heading to Hawaii. On second thought, try the location in Maui, if that's the case!",

My opinion quickly changed.  The people behind the register were extremely helpful in describing their recommended items.  My husband and I were also surprised by the decent selection of beer and wine. My entire family ordered the fish tacos.  They were beautifully plated and extremely delicious. They were probably the best fish tacos I have ever had. Also, I must mention that this place was immaculate. That is HUGE for me. The restrooms were extremely clean and the floors and tables were spotless. The service was excellent. Our plates were cleared as soon as we finished and we were checked on at least 2 times during the meal. We will definitely be back! Great job Coconut's!",

The coconut shrimp appetizer was very yummy and hot, and my poke was delicious and the perfect size. The seafood pasta dish was HUGE, so only got partly eaten, but had lots of seafood. The fish tacos were yummy and large too. Not an inexpensive meal, but quite good and what I would expect from a traditional sit down place even though it was walk up and order. Loved the surfboard tables, too fun!",

    "text": "Although the food is really good at a great price, this is NOT what this review will be about. THERE are TOO MANY other RESTAURANTS out there with GREAT FOOD. The service, the attitudes of the servers and the manager at this location is appalling. My wife and I arrived at the counter at 8:30pm and were immediately told the restaurant closes at 9pm. I informed this extremely rude worker that 9pm was 30 minutes from then and he replied \"just need to let you know.\" I said we were going to sit on the patio anyway and he replied \"we have problems with people wanting to sit out there for 2 hours\". I'm thinking, Okay, well whatever... You know when that little voice says \"LEAVE!\" ,... well, yeah, I ignored it. Boy was I sorry I dd. As if this wasn't bad enough, it gets worse!!  The food finally came (normally I wouldn't have worried about it ... but we were on a time clock!!) I asked for an extra plate so my wife and I could share one of the dishes, it literally took the guy 5 minutes to get it to us. At 8:45 they start dumping the ice tea after we asked him to please save the one tea my wife drinks and wanted to get one to go. I had to go in to ask again if they could save the tea. I noticed this woman with a gallon jug filling it up with ice tea and I asked if they were going to put that out so we can get refills from it... She looked at me and stated NO! This was for an employee who wanted to take home ice tea. (side note: hope the employee is paying for it!!)  Right about this time a HUGE group of about 10 people walked in and wanted to eat and this guy tells them, we're closing. Sorry!... The group said, \"I thought you were open until 9pm?\" And he said, \"well it's almost that time now, Sorry!\" UNBELIEVABLE!! At 8:50 this same guy and girl come out onto the patio and start stacking chairs REALLY LOUDLY and it seemed quite obvious at this point that they wanted us to pack up our food and leave!! I looked at my wife and stated I am staying here until 9pm and I'm going to enjoy my food and ignore the RUDENESS of these employees. When they were done stacking chairs and bringing them into the restaurant this NASTY GUY comes up to us and looks at our food & says \"Oh, looks like you still have some food left\" and started to walk away. (It was 8:58pm)... at this point I took the opportunity to let this young man know how rude he was being. How his attitude, words and behavior has made us extremely uncomfortable and will definitely make us NOT want to come there any more. At that point the woman walks over to us and identifies herself as the manager (WHAT?? REALLY??!!!)... and says, \"the owner makes us clock out at 9:30pm or we get in big trouble so we have to make people leave by 9pm.\" I asked for the owners name or card as I want to speak with him about this ridiculous policy and it is basically running patrons off. She said he doesn't have a phone number, just an email address. And he's already received complaints about it, but doesn't care. I was shocked at this and want to leave a MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO THE OWNER!! If this truly is your policy I say to you, there are literally THOUSANDS of other places to eat and HUNDREDS of new restaurants opening up and begging for business. Although I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN, you will continually & constantly lose customers with this negative and offensive attitude and behavior...  your employees will not only NOT be clocking out by 9:30... they won't be clocking out at all, as you've run everyone from your business and your doors will close just like the last 10 restaurants in that same location has done before you. GOOD RIDDANCE!",

Plenty of customer service with a smile and most importantly, the food was great! I had the shrimp tacos which seems to be what they're known for and rightfully so. I will definitely come back whenever in the area but will definitely have a hard time not ordering the same because I definitely want to try more of their menu.",

Sometimes different locations can vary, but this Coconuts lived up to my expectations. The fam all got the exact same thing as the previous visit: two fish tacos, poke bowl, and shrimp and chips. Again, everyone was completely satisfied. You might think \"how can I even get full off just two fish tacos?\" Well, they are so huge and topped with toppings that two is plenty! And they have so much flavor!!! I could eat them every day if I had a chance. My wife got the Poke bowl and couldn't finish the whole thing. She loved the flavors and presentation. My kid got the shrimp and fries and was delighted once again. The entire staff was genuinely friendly, too. The restaurant is clean and bright. The special teas they have are a great refresher on a hot day. Zero complaints, would DEFINITELY recommend and will definitely come back.",

Tons of flavor with so many toppings but they all work really well together.  Great location - movie theater and Baked Bear right next door - perfect date spot! Try the tiger sauce, adds great extra flavors to the tacos!",

After living in FL & CA my food expectations are getting pretty squashed here. I find most of the food average (that's giving a compliment)  Coconut shrimp was very good. ( if you like fried )  Skewer shrimp was a 5.  Mahi mahi blackened fish was made to order & VERY dry.  Fish tacos were mehhhh. All the stuff on them is fine. BUT Fish itself was dry & one can only taste the seasonings. Yes they are large order. Outside taco shell was hard. Inside one was wet. Not very good at all.

    "text": "Love love love Coconut's! I first discovered Coconut's fish cafe in Maui and decided to try it when I was in Scottsdale.  They have a nice outside seating area and they keep it clean.   You go up to the counter and order. In Maui I had signed up for their promotional offers (you rack up points every time you go and you get discounts and offers the more you go). There seemed to be a slight disconnect with the promotional accounts because when I wanted to use my 20% off, she didn't know what I was talking about. Regardless, the person taking my order was super nice and gave me the discount anyways. The prices are fair and the portions are decently-sized.  This time I tried the fish tacos (with tomato salsa, cheese, tomatoes and mango salsa) and the macadamia nut-crusted mahi mahi on brown rice with veggies. The fish is so fresh! I was slightly worried about the freshness of the fish in arizona, but the manager said that they fly the fish in fresh every day. I love their mango salsa! Everything in the fish tacos pairs together magically. The macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi is also delicious--perfectly crispy, not oily, with a perfect layer of macadamia nuts. Even the brown rice is good!  Overall, friendly staff, clean restaurant, fair prices, and delicious food! I definitely recommend Coconut's and I can't wait to eat there again.  For all of you in Socal, they're opening a Coconut's in Los Angeles in February 2018. I will definitely be there!",

The fish quality is great, I love getting the spicy ahi pokey with taro root chips, fantastic!  It's on the menu as a starter, but I usually have this for a low carb filling meal.    I have had their fish tacos, and like everyone else says they are delicious. I generally do not like coleslaw things, but here it is not overly soggy and not sweet. It really does work with the tacos - trust the menu!   My only complaint is that I cannot get one taco ala carte; it's an order of 3, and I can't eat that many by myself. So I don't get the have one unless I bring a friend.   They have a great little patio out front with sunshades. A pleasant place to set.",

It was full of seafood and had a very unique, delicious flavor. We split the fish tacos and they were the best ones I have ever eaten. They are not the usual fish taco with SW flavor a. They are definitely a Hawaiian taco, and the mango adds a delightful sweetness to their special ingredients. I wish they were in Denver where we live. This is a place I would come to often!",

    "text": "Great location simple and straightforward ambience. We're here on the mainland seeing the Mayo Clinic and wanted a taste of Hawaii.  Of course our expectations were not to enjoy truly fresh well prepared seafood.  We ordered the seafood pasta and grilled Ono with wild/ brown rice and vegetables.  The biggest problem was an overall lack of flavor.  Not from fresh fish but seasoning.  Good news both meals were quite large and filling.  The price is relatively low.    The bad news.  Seafood pasta came out with cheese sprinkled on it when it was closer to an italian seafood marinara than anything else but no tastable garlic and in dire need of seasoning.  It did have a nice chunky tomato sauce but tasted like right out of the can.  Not bad for the price but it wouldn't take much to make it better without increasing cost.  And leave the cheese off unless the customer demands it.    Ok the ono was good considering the thin slice it was grilled pretty good. Hard to make it rare when so thin. The wasabi aioli was excellent.  Wild or brown rice lacked seasoning and was bland.  Way to el Dante crunchy it was.  The vegetables were steamed and would have been far better grilled with a little olive oil and seasoning.    Service was self serve so good value employees were professional and polite.   Just don't ask for the Kama aina rate even as a joke.   Bottom line.  Will only return if in dire need.  Not the best.",

    "text": "First time at this location and it is just as good if not better than the one on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and Scottsdale. The tacos came out so fresh and hot that I had to quickly set it back down as I tried to cram the heaping pile of love into my face. It was too hot to hold! The tiger sauce is amazing, you must try it if you go here. I was a little bummed that I saw you can get the fish put on a bun and served as a sandwich. Fish tacos are my favorite amd I kinda sorta tunnel visioned in on the tacos only. Whilst drooling and ordered the tacos again before realizing I could have gotten a fish burger. I wanna say the are the Hawaiian buns, similar to the Kings Hawaiian rolls",

The large chucks of tough cabbage wasn't quite palatable.  So I decided. To give it another try and I went to the location on Shea road.  I have the fish tacos and coconut shrimp. Both dishes were good, but yet ago my fish was on the drier side. Even though both times I had my food to go, the service was great.",

I'm not sure, but the meals we sampled were utterly dreadful.  We really could've done better with Long John Silver's or traveled 11 miles west to The Codfather in order to have gotten a better meal.  It was both the Fried Fish and the Fried Calamari that did it in for us. They were completely overdone.  It's as if they had been allowed to sit  too long in the fryer.  The fish should have at least been nice and tender. But no! It was as hard as if it come out of the freezer. This happens when its been cooked far too long.   The Calamari was the same way. It was so tough that my wife had to use the knife just to cut them into little pieces so that they could be consumed.  The fries were overdone as well.  Then to top it all off, we both had stomach aches hours later after having consumed these meals.  It was so disappointing because the reviews of respected Yelp reviewers really made this place sound so appealing. However, the experience from our visit did not live up to our expectations.",

And honestly I would say food at least what we tried is 5 stars! We had the coconut shrimp basket and it was really tasty and yummy! Freshly fried and crispy coconuts in your mouth. Side fries and coleslaw was really good and fresh as well! I loved the outdoor seating and I couldn't believe the service! They were super friendly and great. Loved this spot! Should try other foods from here although it's hard to say no to their signature coconut shrimp basket. Also I would say the pricing isn't that bad at all considering having a seafood meal.",

Regardless, a bit of an odd thing to advertise, I thought), some of them didn't seem to go well together. For instance, mango and cheese. Maybe I just like my tacos simpler.

    "text": "Coconut's isn't the first Hawaiian chain to hit the valley and it almost certainly won't be the last.  But to be fair to owner Michael Phillips, this is one Hawaiian chain that really can trace it's roots back to the islands.  I personally have not yet visited our 50th state, but I've sampled a fair share of Hawaiian cuisine at valley spots like Hula's, Leo's Island BBQ, and a number of poke shops.  With their original location still operating in Maui, Coconut's now has locations throughout California and Arizona.  On a Sunday at lunchtime, I wandered into Coconut's Shea location.  Located in the Harkins Shea 14 complex on the northwest side of 74th Street & Shea Blvd, Coconut's resides just a few doors down from the theatre.  There's room for I'd guess about 60-70 at a time with the majority of seating out on the patio.  Order up front here, grab a number, and they bring the good stuff out to you.  As today was well into the triple digits, I happily planted myself inside amongst the surfboard smooth wooden seating.  Now then, to the important stuff.  There were two menu items that stood out both from Yelp reviews as well as per the manager on duty.  First off, their Coconut Shrimp appetizer.  Six shrimp battered in coconut and then fried.  Plus they're served with a thai chili pineapple sauce.  Secondly, their Fish Tacos, the dish that apparently made Coconut's famous.  17 ingredients are in each of these tacos altogether, but here are the important highlights:  Ono and Mahi Mahi fish, cheese, coleslaw, tomato salsa, and mango salsa on a pair of corn tortillas.  Lastly, I got a beer.  In this case, a Hanalei Island IPA from Hawaii's very own Kona Brewing.  Total cost for the food, drink, and tax came to about $30.  The verdict?  The IPA was incredibly refreshing, slightly fruity, and with a mellow hoppiness that goes down easy.  The coconut shrimp each had a great crunch and the chili pineapple sauce gives you the flavors of both without the pain.  I could've eaten dozens of these.  Lastly, the main event.  The tacos.  These tacos are piled ridiculously high so good luck biting into these without half the ingredients falling onto your plate.  If you can keep it altogether for at least the first bite, you will be as impressed as Zagat apparently was.  An explosion of flavors & textures that match the array of colors that make up this taco.  I really loved the mix of different salsas to give the tacos extra depth.  Two tacos were more than enough to satisfy my appetite.  So yeah, I get why this place has caught fire.  The price point versus the portion sizes might be slightly on the high side for some, but the quality of the food is such that I didn't mind paying a few extra bucks.  And as other Yelpers have noted, the staff are over the top friendly here and were incredibly knowledgable about the menu and the restaurant's backstory.  With all the Hawaiian restaurants I've been to in the valley, seems like the only logical next step would be to book a flight to the islands at my next opportunity and get the genuine article.  Someday, Hawaii, someday.",

They're so filling that my better half and I share one order, making it a very affordable dinner for two but slightly pricey for one.  (One order is 10.99.)  It's another fast-casual restaurant (love this trend, keep them coming!), cutely decorated with a Hawaiian surfer theme.  The tables look like old-time surf boards.  Now, on the tacos:  The regular order consists of chopped grilled (not fried) tuna with a delicious cole slaw, chunks of mango, and a creamy tangy sauce, all on two corn tortillas.  (They're easy to split with someone else because each taco is separate.)  The coleslaw is worth spot-lighting, it brings satisfying texture and crunch in a healthy package (cabbage is very good for you).",

We had a great time and the fish tacos were great. We came back home to AZ and low and behold, there is a Coconut's Fish Cafe in our own back yard. As it turns out, Coconut's has a couple of locations in the lower 48, one of which is on Shea and Scottsdale Roads in Scottsdale. We dropped in this past July before going to a movie and were pleasantly surprised. OK, we couldn't see the Pacific Ocean from the window, but the fish tacos were just as good. As a bonus, they had Longboards on tap. We will be back.",

After having lived in coastal cities like Los Angeles and Seattle for 16+ years I can definitely say that based on reviews and people I have met in my 3 years in Phoenix, the people who live here do not know the meaning of fresh seafood. Scottsdale is full of old people, so combine that with the fact that these people here dont know what fresh seafood is, and you get a bunch of idiots thinking they're eating \"fresh fish\".  I had their fish tacos, dreadful. I had their \"calamari\", I wish I took a picture of it because what in the hell is the sad excuse of a dish that they call calamari at this place? They're more like chicken tenders rather than thinly sliced squid. The fish was cooked horrifically, it almost had the  texture of chicken. Lets put it this way, I bet the Maui branch of this place is 10x better than the one here in Arizona. On top of all of that because its in \"Scottsdale\" its over priced to shit. Honestly do not go here unless your palette is unable to discern between fresh and frozen. The calamari was the real killer for me, what a disgusting excuse of a dish and waste of money.  I realize to some this might sound pompous and like im trying to act like im better than anyone, but after having a strong craving for some fresh seafood and fish tacos, this place was a major disappointment. I know its arizona, I know its landlocked, but Del Taco does a better job with fish tacos than this place.",

We would both return again with our husbands. It was a deal for 10.00 approx each for a low fat fish lunch!",

My check in got me a discount on the best coconut shrimp appetizer I've ever had!  We grabbed the ahi poke appetizer to share as well, which was spectacular.    We shared the tacos (serviceable) the chowda (amazing) and the fish n' chips (delightful)... the tacos just had too much going on and would have been better served with less fillings / less mess.  The chowda was the best I've had in Arizona and the fish was crispy and perfectly cooked yet not greasy - something that is NOT easy to do when frying fish.  No room for dessert, but that didn't matter cause we washed it down with a few beers and were incredibly satisfied with our meal.  For being a casual (order / pay up front) type place, the food was really spot on.  Best part is, it's next door to the ol' ABC - so I got to reminisce about all my good times getting yelled at before they closed down.  GO HERE and get some of the best Hawaiian seafood in town!!",

Coconut's was quite a disappointment - these tacos were certainly not up to the hype of some of the reviews on here.   We went on a Friday night ready to fill our faces with fish taco goodness. We got two orders of tacos and a basket of fries. In retrospect this ended up being enough food for two people - not to mention it was close to $40 bucks which is a lot for a couple tacos and fries.  The tacos are large, loaded up with mahi mahi and ono, slaw, tomatoes and mangos. They looked really good. First of all they were a mess to eat. The toppings went everywhere because it was so much. But the biggest disappointment was the fish itself. It was super dry and totally bland. The only flavor to the tacos was in the sauce. I was really expecting more from the fish itself since they are called Coconut's FISH cafe. The French fries were like McDonald's fries and were probably the best part of the dinner.   Given the price and how dried out the fish was, I highly doubt we'll ever go back.",

The manager Ashley was super sweet and kind. Checking on us as well and answering any questions we had! The food came out of the kitchen super fast and super fresh. I've eaten here before and every time, it's been amazing!  It's a serious must go!!!",

    "text": "We were excited to try out this restaurant, as we ate at a Coconut's in Maui earlier this year. Unfortunately, it's not nearly as good as the one in Hawaii. Most of our fish tacos consisted of cabbage, and there was very little fish. Our daughter had the chicken taco salad, and again, it was mostly cabbage and very little chicken. Great place to eat in Maui, but not necessarily in Scottsdale.",

Fish tacos are their speciality cramming 14 ingredients into each one. Quite delicious but the tortillas are disappointingly hard. Makes for a stellar casual lunch date especially if you're in the mood for fish in whilst in the desert.",

    "text": "Ate there on Thursday evening arriving 20 min b4 closing-- no worries the two young ladies on the evening closing staff were very friendly and pleasant. We ordered the Ono  and the mahi  mahi dinners with rice and slaw, one blackened and one lemon butter.  Both were very tasty and well prepared. The coconut milk slaw is very good as well.  We also had the seafood pasta with the white sauce(lite creamy Alfredo type). This was heart stopping good with generous portions of fish and shrimp in the pasta although you will need another 45 min on the treadmill to work it all off. I am excited about returning. I have been to several similar casual dining concepts in CA with  the freshly prepared fish but had not found one in Phx. Looking forward to enjoying an evening or afternoon meal on the patio.",

My favorite is the mahi on a salad or rice as well as the fish tacos, they never disappoint!   If you are looking for a new place for fresh fish to go, give this restaurant a try!",

The Mahi in the fish and chips was good but the the breading did not really work with thier dill tarter sauce. The \"chips\" were just thin cut french fries and not True chips you would expect with fish and chips. The fish and chips also came with coleslaw but it was basically just cabbage with a splash of something reminiscent of coconut.",
