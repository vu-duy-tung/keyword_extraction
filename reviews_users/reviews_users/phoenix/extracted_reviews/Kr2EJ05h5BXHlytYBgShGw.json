Then the Porch is the right place for you. I went on my first date in five years yesterday and it was definitely worth the wait. As we got seated, MY DATE GOT TO LITERALLY SIT ON A SWING. That's win number one for me. After we were seated, our waitress was attentive, nice, and helpful. I ordered the Porch protein bowl and I could feel the GAINS coming every time I took a bite. My date got the seizure salad and loved it. That's win number two. After finishing dinner, we proceeded to play cornhole. I took this as an opportunity to try and teach my date the way of the corn. But little did I know she was a natural. Girl straight cornholed three in a row at one point, definitely destroying the confidence in my game. That was the only L I took all night. Overall, the Porch provided me with a first date experience I will never forget! Moral of the story: never underestimate how good people from Indiana are at cornhole. You will instantly regret it. #GCUGAINTRAIN",

Came back a couple of weeks later and my expectations were up a bit as I was anxious to order off the menu. Tons of servers standing around and food was \"meh\" nothing other than regular bar food. I thought the servers by now would be rock stars and no one seemed to be too interested in the few customers that were in there.  We live in the neighborhood and we're glad to see bike racks went up.  Well give it another try as we really want this place to work but there's a lot of competition opening nearby - needs to be exceptional.",

We were seated promptly and our server, Bruce, was efficient, friendly, and competent. Eric, the manager, spent time reviewing the menu with us in detail. I dine mostly at bar and grills and expected the standard fare. And although the menu offers lots of salads and sandwiches, it was definitely not the standard fare - I had a very tasty Mediterranean Pita with a much better than average side salad. I found the prices for food and drink average for similar establishments. The wine selection is well rounded. The patrons seemed to be having a lot of fun. The ASU basketball game got a lot of attention and the dart board and shuffleboard were well used. The only issue I had was the noise level, making it difficult for our group of ten to have audible conversation.",

Food was ok- I had a rice bowl and it was decent, he had a burger that he said he's had better. He paid via credit card and we left. Two days later, his credit card company contacted him saying The Porch was trying to submit a charge for $10 more than the bill. Mind you, we're very generous tippers and left a decent tip with the bill, but they tried for more. He called and spoke to a gentleman who stated he would see a credit within 48 hours. 5 days later, still no credit so he called again, another guy answered the phone, took down his name and CC# and stated he submitted the credit right then- 2 days later, nothing. He ended up having to submit a dispute to the credit card company and got the credit immediately. Will never go back and will NOT recommend this place!!",

Called today (Monday) to make a reservation for next Saturday (1/13) for a birthday party for 8 people, two of which are kids. They called me back about a half hour later saying they couldn't actually take our reservation because there's a football game that day. Um, what? We just wanted a table to come eat and celebrate and you can't take our reservation because it might be busy? That's why we're asking to reserve a table. We asked for an early reservation at 3pm. The girl I spoke with was very nice and I'm not shooting the messenger. I just find it rude that a new place in the area is turning bigger parties away because they're anticipating a big football crowd.   The good news is there are plenty of other restaurants that we will be happy to celebrate at. The Porch won't miss us, but considering the already less than stellar reviews, maybe they should. My dad (the birthday boy) was looking forward to this place so that's a big bummer  :(",

First... when HALF of your menu is unavailable you should notify your guests upon seating them. It wasn't until after our server brought us drinks that she told us that ALL of the tacos were off the menu and that the preztel bites were out and ALL appetizers that had some form of meat had been switched with what was available. Second... as I had to switch my order last minute (I wanted tacos), I settled on the bruschetta. It was eh. Very bread heavy and was barely room temperature when arrived and cold by the time I finished.   One last thing... It was cold on Sunday (we were there around 7 p.m.) and they had the sliding glass doors open. This made for a VERY uncomfortable dinner... we were ALL freezing.",

I had the South of the Border cocktail that was pretty good, although I'm not sure if I'd order it again for $13. But the major thing that factored into my rating is that the bartender seemed annoyed we were even there. My friend and I commented on how she didn't smile once the entire time we were there and hardly said a word, until the very end as we left and she greeted a guy sitting down by himself. Maybe it was just us? Not sure but based on today's visit I definitely don't plan on going back.",

Visited the Porch 5-6 times in the last 8 months and the results are always the same. Slow service, staff on their cell phones half the time, inexperienced bartenders, hostess who have no idea what their job is. At this point you have to blame the mangers and hiring staff for putting people in these positions. Either they're trying to save a buck or the don't have a clue. There no way they can't take note of the terrible service.",

Once I arrived, we noticed that the server section was too much and he could never get caught up. It was hard seeing such a great server drowning while management was just standing there.  When we attempted to order the PBLT, we were informed that they decided not to work with pork belly...? Why have it on the menu...? I thought this was interesting considering they just opened...  I ordered the vegan poke bowl and the portions were incredibly small for the price. When the nachos arrived the steak was cold, but had decent flavoring.  Between the portion size and cold steak I had to give 3 stars. Hopefully before Phoenix's busy season they can figure It all out.",

My wife and I run an Ugly Christmas Sweater Bike Bar Crawl in the Arcadia area and the Porch happens to land right in our normal path. Knowing they were still in their soft opening at this time and wouldn't necessarily be prepared to welcome 65 rowdy drinkers with the Christmas spirit (that's what we'll call our drunkenness) I decided to ask the GM if he'd be okay if we came in on short notice. He didn't hesitate and said they'd love to have us.  A few days later, we rolled in to an already jam packed place on their first Saturday afternoon and everything went off without a hitch. We got a warm welcome, great service, and a great atmosphere. Reviews so far don't do this place justice and you'd know what I mean if you got to drive by the Porch every day. It has been busy every day since it opened and it's a great addition to the Arcadia area!",

When we sent something back the manager never stopped by our table to talk to us about what went wrong with the dish (chicken tenders- the breading tasted oddly sweet and moldy to me), and our server was clearly uncomfortable because she knew we were upset. We would have stayed for a nightcap and dessert but being charged for something we didn't eat or like because \"it's so popular\" and \"no one ever complains about it\" made us feel quite stupid.  It's a shame because the patio has a great ambience and we go out for a drink quite often. Unfortunate that the manager can afford guests walking out unsatisfied without even a table touch. I literally never write bad reviews- I'd rather contact the restaurant directly, (would have ideally preferred talking to the manager that night but it was clearly not an option) but when I called I was put on hold by a hostess and no one picked up the line after ten minutes. Too many pieces of the puzzle went wrong for us to spend our money here again.",

Open-minded and ready for a couple drinks amidst tax season, we took our seats outside at a picnic table.   To start, we got bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers, fried pickles, the giant pretzel with cheese, and drinks. My fig mule was just what I needed. The Besos Calientes and skinny margs were very well received by our table. We polished off the first round of apps happily (the pretzel was my favorite, but everything hit the spot) and ordered round two: more jalapeno poppers, twice cooked chicken wings, and the short rib nachos. The wings were alright, but everyone really enjoyed the nachos.   We also jumped at the opportunity to try the tacos. One order of each: green chile pork, blackened shrimp, and braised short rib. Plus veggie tacos. YUM. All of them.   Service throughout was great. Our girl was friendly and made sure our drinks were never empty. When my friend and I decided to share the Porch burger off the happy hour menu (with a side of the truffle parmesan fries- which I wouldn't recommend only because the truffle was REALLY strong), it came out split and on separate plates. We hadn't even requested it that way!   Overall, we were thrilled and appreciative of everything The Porch had to offer. I can't wait to enjoy more patio drinks and eats before the temperature climbs any higher.",

Manager seems to be on top of things but staff is totally incompetent. Best was when I asked what domestic bottles they offered and I was told corona.

The noise was deafening- I seriously mean DEAFENING! There was one tiny table in the center of the din- we opted to turn back never to return again. If you are between 18 and 30, this is the place to hang I guess- cuz it seemed like that entire age  Demographic was there. Checking out the menu online- it showed nothing unusual. But I guess it must have some \"cool\" attraction -we elected not to wait to discover it! Go at the peril of your eardrums.",

A fireplace separates the dining area/patio when the cooler temps set in. Parking in this area is usually a hassle but not here.  We pulled up and were immediately greeted by the FREE valet...woooohooo!   We were ready for a few bloodies and some breakfast.  Had the breakfast burritos and they were amazing...bloodies had the right spice and a large piece of bacon for stirring.  Nice touch!  Oh....and the beer menu.  Very impressed by the microbrews with a few of my favorites, Sculpin and Guava Islander.  We happened to run into the owner John and you just sense he cares about getting the details right and delivering for his customers.   If you're looking to support a local business that has a friendly vibe with great cocktails and food GO HERE!!!",

I went for happy hour, and we ordered a bunch of apps. We had the pretzels and cheese (literally so buttery and delicious), jalapeno poppers wrapped in bacon, French fries, bruschetta, and tostadas. All of it was brought out promptly and it was all so yummy! We also ordered drinks - I had the fig mule and it was so refreshing. I would definitely order it again!   The outdoor space is super cute and they have lots of games and TVs. It's right next to the street, but I honestly didn't notice the cars that much at all. They have high fences and lights so I barely noticed.   Our server was super friendly and attentive. He made sure our waters were full and brought out a dog bowl for our furry friend!   I would definitely come back here! Take all the negative reviews with a grain of salt because it might not have been ready to open when it did, but it's up and running and a great time now!",

The two gentlemen next to us asked for a side of ranch...15 minutes later and still no ranch. When our bartender finally asked us how the food was I let her know that they had asked for ranch yet, never received it. It was about this time one of the gentlemen got up and walked over to the kitchen window and asked for ranch.  The food was good, but I wouldn't go back or recommend it to others.

Had the grilled cheese with short ribs and tasted yummy but small serving compared to some of the yelp photo posts viewed. My friend had the Mac and cheese and it looked really yummy. On a hot day, avoid sitting near the sliding door windows inside. The waitresses tend to use the service computer outside and they would rather air condition the great outdoors than understand that your patrons sitting near the opening are probably sweating their a$$ off because you left the door wide open 10x within a one hour period. I didn't come there to be your door man. Cool decor inside with ample seating. Nice outdoor patio, but kinda noisy since it faces Indian School Road. Need to try more drinks and other food items before I give this place a higher rating. Our server was cool though, so kudos to him.",

We sat at the bar so we could shoot darts and there is a bartender but she never ask me if I wanted anything to drink or eat. She is more focused on her boyfriend that is hovering over her every move. So at this point I figure well Im not giving this place any of my hard earned coin!! As we continues shooting darts the staff is giving us dirty looks for continuing our game. And we are getting stares from sone blue haired women there as well. So Terrible service and they cone off like its the customers honor to  spend money in their establishment. So I have an Update from the GM of the Porch so they offer service if you want anything you have to ask. I thought service meant they asked you if you would like a drink or maybe see the menu?? And i have never seen a bartender kiss a regular on the lips!!",

    "text": "I live in Arcadia so I was excited to have a fun new cool sports bar with hopefully better than average sports bar food. I arrived around noon last Sunday the 3rd, I had trouble finding the NFL game I wanted to view, I did find a small vignette sitting area with two TV's, a gentleman that I assumed was in management, was kind and courteous and quick to switch one of the two TVs to my game. Shortly there-after, I was approached by a second gentleman, I assume another manager, he ask if I would relocate to the bar, he would then turn my game on one of the many TV's in that area, because he mentioned he had a large party that was waiting to be seated and he could put them in the area where I once was, I noticed 10 minutes later it was actually 2 people, and remain 2 people for the remainder of the time I was in the establishment, which was about an hour and a half. In this area there were two flat-panel TVs and enough space for 6 individuals, I easily could've stayed where I was, and the couple that replaced me at this location would've had adequate privacy. I ordered a bloody mary from one of the female bartenders, a gentleman bartender asked me why I don't like bacon, not knowing what he was referring to, I replied, I love bacon, he said \"oh they forgot the most important garnish\" and he placed a nice strip of bacon in my beverage. I asked the same male bartender if he could describe the different wing sauces to me and he said he had not tried them and didn't really have enough understanding to give me a description, I went ahead and ordered wings with one of the different and unique sauces, it took about 45 minutes to receive my order and once I receive them, they were lukewarm at best. Once I received my guest check I noticed one of the bartenders had taken her discretion and given me Tito's for a $2.00 up charge, which I did not request Tito's, The bill was adjusted. By the way, Windsor, St. Francis The Vig, & many establishments on Sundays do some great bloody Mary specials and even have bloody mary garnish bars, food for thought! I understand you're new, I've owned two businesses, but I always looked at my business in this scenario, if I were a hospital, I couldn't merely say \"oh we're new, sorry we killed the first 30 people, give us a few weeks and will get it right\". I think you have to get it right the day you open the door, this is why George Beale and the Hillstone restaurant group is so extremely successful.",

We asked if it could be turned down but that fell on deaf ears , we called the restaurant to ask if it could be tuned down and the hostess had to go outside to hear on the phone. There were 7 of us , our server didn't notice one of our party didn't get her food until the rest of us were almost done. We were trying to get his attention, we could see his back talking to the people in the kitchen.  We asked the server if they could close the blinds as it was getting bright, same thing, he was back talking in the kitchen. Gave it another chance, The server was very nice, the music was not blasting.  We ordered Nachos with no avocado, husband and daughter have severe allergies, bet you can guess what green stuff came on the Nachos !!!  The music was perfect , actually had a great conversation with our teenager. Today we went in again , we sat down tried to speak across the table ...we left and went to a restaurant down the road to eat. We all go out for different  reasons, I want to relax , enjoy the company I am with and eat some good food and have a few drinks.

First we waited 30 mins for a table which on a Friday night is expected and this place was packed! So I was hoping it was gonna be worth the wait. When we finally got seated the hostesses didn't give us enough menus we had to get up and ask for more, our table was still dirty, and we weren't greeted for over 10 mins. When the server finally came over there was no \"sorry about the wait\" or anything. We gave him our order for appetizer and asked for a round of waters, the water didn't come til after the appetizer was on the table! We ordered our food at 9:39, at 10:20 we finally asked how much longer it was gonna be. At this point the restaurant was pretty empty. Our food came out finally and it was cold and just lacking in general. Burgers were dry and over cooked, chicken panini was soggy, seemed as if the food was just sitting in the window. We kept having to ask the server over and over again for refills and he came over and dropped a pitcher on our table, like I'm sorry do you not have time to get refills we have to do it ourselves? We ended up asking for a manager TWICE. All around it was a bad experience. I probably won't ever be back.",

I should have checked the yelp reviews prior ugh.  Stopped by for lunch today with my husband. The place was about half full.  Nothing on the menu really caught my eye (sign #1 we should have just left), the waitress was very attentive but when it came time to order, she informed us that about half the menu was unavailable bc they were in the process of redoing it (sign #2 we should have just left, would have been nice to know when we sat down), ok, needed a few more minutes to decide what we were going to have instead, we decided on a fondue and pretzel app and to split a Rueben sandwich.  She came back and when we ordered said 'oh wait we don't have the pretzel fondue either' ok soo we ordered jalapeno poppers and a Rueben and my husband ordered a beer.  Our food ended up coming out at the same time (ok fine we didn't specify that we wanted the appetizer as an app) but my husband never got his beer.  We ate our food, bottom bread of the Rueben was soggy and the waffle fries were really oily, the poppers were really good.  When the check came the beer was included, the waitress was pretty upset that we never got the beer (she obviously didn't forget it, the bar did), it got that taken off.    If this was my restaurant and I was in the middle of a huge menu re-do, I would have managers walking around all day to each table to talk to people, apologize, maybe talk about the new exciting things that will be on the new menu, maybe even offer some sort of free appetizer, something to get people to come back once the new menu was out.",

    "text": "I was so excited to see this place as it was going up. For the last few months I have been passing by it on my way to a local school to work as a Student Teacher. Today was the last day I needed to complete before I graduated. My husband wanted to celebrate and take me somewhere nice to celebrate. I requested The Porch thinking it would be a perfect fit.  Upon we put in our name with the hostess. She warned us it would be a 30 minuet wait. It was a little chilly outside but we thought 30 minutes wouldn't be to bad. She took our name and phone number and told us there were games outside to play. We walked around looking for the games but they were awkwardly placed near diners and it didn't feel comfortable to step up. We looked around inside and saw a good number of open tables meant for small groups so I figured the 30 minuet wait would be accurate. We sat outside on cute lawn chairs and waited for the Text for our table. After 45 minuets my husband went to check on the wait time, he was told 6 couples were still ahead of us. I looked around the dinner and outside area and still saw open tables. After an hour and a half wait my husband went up agin and asked. We were told the only way we could be seated was if we shared a picnic bench with strangers outside. I was hungry and agreed. As we passed by their were still available tables inside that apparently we were not good enough for. The people next to us acted surprised that we were seated and while I didn't ask them I assume they were not asked if they would share they way they reacted.  So we sit outside looking at menus, no space heaters, no fire in the fire place. 15 minuets go by and no one comes. Finally a guy named Jeff stops by asking us if the food he has is our order. We tell him now and inform him that nobody has been by to check on us. He tells us very friendly that he will find her server and leaves. We wait some more and decided has finally been enough and agree that we will leave to go celebrate somewhere else. Jeff meet us as were leaving And informs us that he is been trying to look for server I can't find them. We tell him everything that went down and that Larios ready to leave. Jeff was very friendly and I bet if he Had been helping us in the first place the situation may have been different but it wasn't enough. I can't even write a review about the food or drinks or anything else because the whole experience was so bad I'm not sure what to even say more but avoid this place. I hope that management repress and correct the situation so that this can be the new addition to the community that I hoped it would be.",

We decided to stay to give the porch a fair shot. We were seated in a round comfortable booth, not much to choose from the menu but we all made do. When our food came out it was all cold, except the kids meals.The waitress never came back however i was able to track down the manager she asked to repack the meal but we declined so she refunded part of the bill. When our waitress finally made it back to our table to give us our bill, we quickly put the cash down wanting to leave but we had to wait for our change. She took at least ten minutes to show face, so we had to ask another associate to have her bring back our change. when she finally made it back, she threw our change on the table and walked away. this was unacceptable behavior nor is this a restraunt i will ever return to. Terrible review from the host to the waiters.  by far the worst service i ever had. The talk around arcadia we are not the only unhappy customers",

The food was terrible... chicken wings split in half and our entrees were cold when we got them with no flavor. When talking with a manager we just received excuses... no the food was not worth $15 ea. Oh, and they ran out of silverware so it was tricky to cut with plastic silverware. They do serve a mean corona light, though. Hoping this is just early opening issues, may try again in half a year if they are still open. On a positive note, Santa showed up!",

I was also expecting possible company so I wanted to make sure whether they were coming or not. The bartender asked me to order four times within 10 minutes and then rudely stated that I had to order something to stay. I got up and left. She was a complete bitch. Their menu is not gluten friendly anyway as it features couscous.   She lost mine and anybody I knows business permanently.",

The manager \"apologized and said they were new and working through issues\".  Tonight my girlfriend and I decided to give them another try. We were seated right away and ordered drinks. It was nearly 20 minutes until our drinks arrived, and my drink was wrong. They quickly provided a new drink to me and then we ordered food. We ordered pork belly nachos, hummus, and wings. The food arrived in 12 minutes (quick). The order came out wrong and they agreed to correct it. The pork belly didn't taste or look like pork, but only pork is listed on the menu and not beef (I do not eat beef/cows). I kept questioning the pork, but with no beef nachos on the menu, I felt like I was eating a dry pork. It then took another 20 minutes to get a second drink - my drink was wrong, again.... The bill finally came and it said \"short rib nachos\" on the bill. I flipped and asked why they served me beef when it literally says PORK BELLY NACHOS on the menu, and was told \"pork isn't on the menu anymore\". Nobody told us that. The restaurant does not train their staff and has only one bartender to serve the entire seated restaurant. This place is a mess and I can only imagine what it looks like behind the scenes in the kitchen. I would avoid this place until they get their act together. The manager was nice both times, but nice doesn't equate to running a successful restaurant.",

We got there around 6:30 and only waited about 10 minutes before sat. The staff was very accommodating with our requests and made sure to continuously check on us. I didn't get to try much of the food that night, but the rest of the group had no complaints. I plan to come back for brunch next time to take advantage of their rose deal!",

The atmosphere is nice, but it's not a good choice if you don't eat meat. There were minimal options for vegetarians and the waitress was not willing to ask whether things on the menu could be substituted for something else; essentially no accommodations. I wasn't too upset with that because I know I won't be able to eat everywhere, but it was the waitresses lack of willingness to even ask if something could be changed.   I used to work in customer service so it's very important to me as a customer how the staff treats their patrons. I will only come here again because of friends that enjoy watching the game.",

The waitress we had spilled an entire glass of water in my wife's lap, and as she helped pick up the mess, instead of apologizing, she just said \"obviously that could have been worse.\" We brushed it off and went on with ordering food. My wife got her omelette and inside was a big piece of plastic. The waitress took the food back and shortly after, again delivered the same omelette and stated \"that was not plastic, it was egg white film.\" My wife has had her fair share of omelettes, she knows the difference between plastic and egg white film. Again no apology and the fact that that was direction they took it is embarrassing. You made a mistake and then tried to play it off like your customer is an idiot, nice! Finally, the bill comes, and after all of that she charged us full price. Cost yourself a tip and thanks for nothing.    DO NOT GO!!!",

With the open-air floor plan, the games outside and the beer bong flamingo, this place really does feel like a porch party.  The food was never the problem, but everything was delicious. The twice baked wings were even better the second time! I can't stop thinking about them and being paired with a beer suggested by Kalie - it was perfect!

I had the chicken tenders with potato chips, we also had an order of humus and a pretzel with cheese dip.  First, the appetizers were ok...the hummus was fine and everyone enjoyed it.  The pretzel was good, tender and salty and the cheese dip was really good with a mild beer flavor.  My tenders and chips were good.  I really liked the homemade onion dip that was served with the chips and the chips themselves were excellent.  Crunchy and just good.  The tenders were good as well.  The crust was not too crispy and the chicken inside was tender and juicy.  I didn't care for the two dipping sauces that came with them so asked for the ranch, which was good.  Others had the wings, the truffle fries, mason chop salad, the protein bowl, and panini.  The panini was more like a club sandwich with a trip layer...got an \"ok\" on that item.  Truffle fries were good although one order was delivered stone cold and were sent back and replaced with hotter ones.  All in all, everyone said their meals were ok, nothing spectacular.  Sorry...no pictures this time.",

My friend and I ordered some of the chicken tenders with wing sauce (because they were out of chicken wings) mine were completely dry and the fries were the consistency of the kind you might find on the floor of your car. My other two friends ordered the chopped salad. It was literally a bed of lettuce and maybe 4 or 5 toppings. The menu said it was $12, they were charged $14 AND $4 for 2 pieces of chicken....  Services was also horrible.  Really hoping they improve and can make it work!",

The vibe is excellent, with nice big wooden bar, comfortable stools, great music, and great outdoor space.  There are so many TVs this will be the best sports bar around.  The selection of beers and food was fabulous.   Especially the wings which were the best in Arcadia.   Combination of great space and atmosphere, great draft beer, excellent service, fabulous wings, and awesome TVs make this new spot a homerun winner !!!  No other bars in Arcadia can compare",

We started with the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers and the pretzels. Neither blew me away, but both were good. BUT- I got the French Dip Burger with a side of sweet potato fries and I can't rave about it enough. I think I finished it in 4 minutes with not a crumb to spare.  2) Ambiance!  Great out door area!! The decor everywhere is super nice too. Like even the bathrooms   Ok that's all the good.   3) We came at happy hour. We ordered the happy hour beer. Specifically asked for 'the one on happy hour'. Instead we were given the size up (which was $4 more) without being asked.   4) Just like every other reviewer says -The service was bad. We were served our apps without any silverware. Once asked for silverware, the hostesses took 5 minutes to retrieve it. My water was filled once and it was empty for over 20 min at one point. Also -The guy tried too hard - but not enough. For example, see 2). He 'figured' we would want a larger beer. He charged us all completely wrong and one of my friends twice. We tried to flag him down to fix it, but after 10 minutes, gave up.   I don't know - this place has so much potential but needs some major fixes.",

I am short, so the table was at my collar bone. My husband is tall, and was still uncomfortable. Seems like quite the sacrifice for style. Also seems easily fixable: lower the tables.  The bad: the food is terrible. We ordered happy hour bar snacks, and while expectations for finger food are always low, it was remarkably bad. The pretzels and fondue were definitely not house-made, but previously frozen pretzels and fondue from a can. It is easy to make a fondue, and a reasonable expectation for a restaurant to serve house made fare. The chicken tacos were edible, but the green salsa was like water.   *If the food had been even decent, the happy hour prices would have been a fair price. However, since I can buy the exact same food at costco and reheat it as they did, I find the prices to be extortion.",

That was a great catch by the server but a mis-representation on the menu.  Overall, the environment has potential, but service was slow, and menu options could use work. I take the under bet on this place succeeding unless they make some quick changes.",

I got the Cuban sandwich which I though was tasty, my spouse ordered a salad that made no mention of dried fruit and yet it came with a lot of dried fruit which turned her off. I probably would have given it at least 3 stars if a member of the wait staff (not our specific server) didn't laugh in our faces when a little girl left a cherry stem on our table like we were supposed to take out the trash. Would have liked to leave a better review, but, I just can't.",

The burgers we were going to order also didn't come because the server barely came back enough times for us to place that order.  It took OVER 45 minutes to get one beer.  The best part is after I told the server to cancel our next round, the manager came over to apologize and said he wanted to make it right.  We stuck around for another 15 mins watching him NOT get us our beers, not rush out our food or assist in any other way.  Worst service and worst management I have seen in a very long time.

I understand that they are new and need to work out some issues but when the wait is over 30 minutes for some eggs and toast, well, that's too long.  They had a menu which looked very good only to find out you can't order from that menu until 1pm. Then why put that menu out on the tables? Oh for the drinks on the back? Poor excuse, get a separate menu. Oh and how about having some salt and pepper at the table? Pitchers of water at the table would have solved our 10 person table water problem, rather than bringing one glass at a time. As it was we ate in shifts as the plates came out one by one with a waiter walking around trying to find out who on the patio the meal was for. So disorganized! These people need a lot more training.",

    "text": "So very sad and disappointing.  Went there for dinner on 12/20. My husband and I were so excited for The Porch to open and were already planning having a party there b/c the patio looked so cool. Sadly, that will not be happening as the overall decor was really the only redeeming quality we found.  We were seated pretty quick, but from then on the service went downhill. We were a group of 5, we all ordered drinks and 2 appetizers. 1 person never got her glass of wine, and after 10 min we had to flag down the waitress from across the room, and then waited another 5 min for it to arrive. There were huge gaps in service and it took forever for things to come out. Finally, the meals come out, and they forgot my husband's meal. The waitress came over, noted that he didn't have his meal and left.  Over 5 min later, she returned, noted AGAIN he didn't have his food and stated that she would look into it.  Why didn't she look into it the first time she noticed that it was missing? Come to find out, the kitchen never made it. She said that she would them make it quick.  After another 15 min, we told her to forget it and my husband no longer wanted it.... Miraculously, it then showed, but at that point is was way too late. She said she would comp it, but, honestly, comping something that we said we no longer wanted is really too little too late. In almost any restaurant I have ever been to, by this point we would have seen the manager in order to better address the situation and at least apologize, but we saw no one.  My generally easy-going husband was livid at this point b/c we spent over $30 per person without his meal and she couldn't even throw in a free beer for him.   The food was mediocre.  I am gluten free, so I had the only meal option available in the Poke bowl.  Very rice heavy, decent amount of tuna, but only a small amount of veg and very dry due to minimal sauce.  My friend didn't like her chicken and waffle wings b/c they were drowning in sauce and wasn't a huge fan of her boyfriend's chicken tenders either. Husband never got to try his meal.... Finally, though the decor was nice and the patio cool, they left the sliders to the patio open and it was FREEZING.  Music was also too loud, making conversation difficult.  In hindsight, I should have looked the reviews b/c this seems to be a common theme.  I am sympathetic to them being newly open and growing pains, but just do the right thing by your customers so they leave happy.",

    "text": "I just moved over here to Arcadia and I'm trying to get my SoSco friends to love it over here too. So we decided to try the newest place in my new hood. Seated promptly, plenty of room, greeted promptly and I will say Jessica was very nice. They seemed maybe a bit overwhelmed although the place wasn't that busy. We ordered the chips and dip and was told they were out of chips. We decided on fried pickles ,which were great, and pretzels and cheese. The cheese sauce wasn't that great. All 6 of us ordered and had minor requests (no tomatoes or no sauce etc) and 2 of them were right. I would suggest telling your servers that if they're busy and have a 6 top with special instructions, to WRITE IT DOWN. No paper and pen is a 100% rookie move. Our server along with her busser kept the drinks full except for the 1 guy drinking beer at our table. Then one of our late comers ordered the poppers which said \"stuffed with smoked cream cheese\" which was not True. They were stuffed with cheese sauce and overcooked. 1 friend and I both had the french dip burger, mine had the horseradish sauce that I requested none of but she fixed it and it was just ok, the other 2 had the other burger which was like a big mac they said and 1 had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed with the chili. Nothing was mind blowing and in fact, we had 3 more people join us after we ate and we told them to go to the Vig and we left. As we were getting our stuff, I noticed a server walk by with chips and dip that we were told you were out of. I get it that they may have made more but we should've been informed of that because 4 of us had to order a different side with our meals because she said there were none.",

It is Wednesday night -not even a weekend   If there is an open parking spot, we should be able to park our own car - we do it daily.  It should not be mandated by someone to have to park the car when there are 7 open spots.  Many patrons won't go to a place requiring valet, I often don't   I like to support local places but there are many good places to eat and this place really has changed and not for the better.",

We were served a dead guy ale and there was a long piece on blonde hair in the drink. It took awhile for Kayla to come around to check on us so we all waited! for the beer to be replaced. I ordered a porch poppers for a starter and it came out with our main food dinner.  Our server never check on us until a table busser came around to gather pit plates. Finally we got our servers attention to get our check. Of course the check was scattered and mixed up, so I got my pen and had to separate the check for her. Realizing, not one of our food was at least comped for the long blond hair.   Poor service okay food, you are more welcome here if you are a hot college student",

The food was okay, a bit overpriced for the quality considering it was marketed as \"brunch specials\". The atmosphere was fun, the outdoor seating is nice and it appears they have a DJ on Sunday. We sat at the bar as we typically do, the service was decent, however, the bartender took my husbands drink before he was finished and didn't ask him if he wanted another until he was done with his meal. Overall we had high expectations for the Porch and unfortunately the experience was just okay.",

After being seated on the patio, it took about 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10 for our waters and bar drinks to arrive. Our server was kind, light hearted, and friendly, but his service skills left little to be desired. He seemed to have several tables on the patio.   I would describe our all round experience as \"average.\" The food was exactly as describe, good, but not great. The atmosphere was lovely, the patio was a perfect spot at sunset. I may consider giving The Porch a second chance in a few months, hopefully they'll staff themselves a bit better and work out their new restaurant kinks.",

Thedrinks were mediocre, and the food wasn't anything to write home about. As a matter of fact, I can't even remember what I ordered. Go figure. The patio is cute though.

Friday nights are lively with a solid atmosphere. Brunch is definitely more chill. Always offer complimentary valet parking. $15 bottles of brut, rose or prosecco. If you plan on having more than one drink (most beverages avg $10), go for the bottle! I went with the bartenders suggestion of chicken tenders and sweet potato fries $12. They were good, but I am excited to get back and try the Brunch Burger $14. Perfect for a day date or HH (HH all day Monday)- excited to come back once it gets cooler so I can sit on the porch",

You know when someone wins the lottery, balls the heck out and is broke again within a few years? That's how I would describe The Porch.  They have a great location, a great building, a really nice patio that is actually cool in Summer... and somehow they mess things up so much that you have no desire to return.  To come out and say, as a server, that you have the best wings in Phoenix with JT's less than a mile away and a Zipps less than a mile away is ballsy. Especially when your wings aren't anything to write home about. Also, I ordered a salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. There was no vinaigrette, it was literally thick balsamic glaze and basically inedible.  The service is absolutely awful as well, our server basically left us on an island the entire time we were there. I really hope this place sells to Fox or LGO because Royale Jelly clearly has no idea what they're doing.  At least they didn't mess up the cold beers.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times for happy hour (3-6:15 M-F), because they'll serve me a pint of Rogue Dead Guy (that's right, folks, they have it on draft here) for $4. Sold on that alone.   Right off of Indian School, the parking lot is pretty small for the size of the place. I've never had too much trouble coming after work, but I imagine it gets pretty dicey on the weekends. Walking into The Porch, it's definitely a casual environment and a good place to throw back a couple beers and some bar food. They've got a handful of arcade games (golden tee and the like) in a corner, in case you want to escape your table for a couple minutes.   Like I said, it's hard to beat a $4 beer special, especially when they've got Dead Guy on tap. The pretzel is also excellent, gigantic and delicious. Would highly recommend. This last time, I opted for the Porch Burger ($7 on happy hour). It was fine, not super notable--a little salt and pepper goes a long way, friends--but the bun was good. I don't know if it was just smaller because it was happy hour, but it was a pretty petite burger (and I'm a very petite person) that I probably would've been kinda upset paying full price for at that size. The fries were excellent, and I'm 100% a fry snob.   Will probably be back for happy hour, but not sure I'd shell out bucks for the burger again. Stick to the pretzels and fries if you're just looking for something to absorb your beer.",

Food (4/5) The menu has traditional bar food items with a bit of a twist. They also have some healthier salads and grain bowls (The Porch Protein bowl is delish!). All items range from $8-$15. Also, the cocktail menu is awesome with lots of delicious, unique options. My favorite is My Ex-Wife Secret - cucumber vodka, watermelon syrup, lime juice and soda water. They are dangerous!  Service (4/5) I've had two different servers and they were both very friendly! They do always seem a bit confused and unable to answer some questions, but they are typically pretty attentive.   Ambiance (5/5) The vibe is really great here! I love that it seems like more of a neighborhood hangout instead of a dingy bar environment. The outside patio is super cute with lots of fun bar games - bags, Jenga, etc.   I'm glad there's a new restaurant and bar to add to my Arcadia rotation!",

The table ordered a burger, wings, the short rib nachos and a bowl. Everyone tasted everything and we all agreed the food was mediocre at best. The short rib nachos were actually kinda bad. The short rib was so dried it was close to beef jerky and it didn't look great. The service was very good I don't remember our waitress name but she was good, attentive and pleasant. I almost gave this place 4 stars because I really liked the vibe but I just think for 4 stars the food has to be good.  I would come again. Probably only for drinks with friends def do dinner somewhere else. I know this place is new so my hope is that they are still working with the menus and chefs.",

We've been to cold beers and cheeseburgers and they cook it horrible! The waitresses have always been great even when they are noticeably busy and overwhelmed. Although, I used to be a waitress so I am more patient when it comes to service. The one waitress even remembered us from a previous time visiting.  The food and drinks have always come fast. The only time I was not satisfied with The Porch was when we sat inside and could not even hear ourselves think the music was so loud (it was not busy AT ALL). We ended up asking to be moved outside and were much happier. We will definitely be back but always on the patio!",

It felt very comfortable. I also really liked the chairs for the high tops. They were very comfortable and the same chairs were around the bar. Overall the food didn't stand out. We had fried pickles, a burger, and fries. I'd say the burger was a bit dry, but I still enjoyed it. The fries were described as shoestring but they were not very thin, just normal fries. Regardless, they tasted good. The waiter provided good service but it was sparse. He only came to take our order and pick up the plates. If he had returned we would have asked for waters in addition to our drinks. Also, we didn't really get any napkins, that would have been nice. Overall  a great atmosphere, mediocre food, and mediocre service.",

    "text": "After seeing the fantastic retro sign and open air seating, I was excited to go to The Porch. We went on a Sunday afternoon, and the weather was perfect for sitting outdoors. The place wasn't overly crowded, and we had our pick of tables. Our server was very friendly and had a great personality, but disappeared once we were served food. The pros: the outdoor area is nice, and a decent place for an afternoon beer. It is along Indian School Rd however, so when motorcycles go by, it is pretty loud. The negs: beyond the retro-themed sign and motel chairs, the place is more of a bro sports bar (if you are thinking it will be more like an Upward Projects or Genuine Concepts restaurant, forget about it). Inside has a few retro fixtures and yellow booths, but the main focal attraction is the huge bar in the middle of the hyper-air-conditioned room. Not only does the retro-theme fall short, the menu and food leave a lot to be desired. The menu selections are uninspired and pricey. My companion had a sloppy joe, which he enjoyed. Not being a meat eater and not in the mood for a salad, I selected the Poke Bowl. For $15 I received an anticlimatic bowl of flavorless white rice, a scattering of tuna, some chopped up cucumber, and some avocado. Knowing what I know now, I would have stopped by one of the countless poke restaurants in the area before going to the Porch, and spent my $ more wisely. If you go to the Porch, go to hang out with your friends to have some cocktails in the outdoor area. Don't bother with the food.",

    "text": "First time here and was ONLY satisfied by the food...service and management on the other hand a BIG negative and definitely ruined the experience. On a steady to slow Thursday we received below par services. Our waitress only took the time to do bare minimum while going above and behind for 2 other tables nearby. Ask for a \"SIDE\" of beans and got a small ramekin of cold beans(if that is serving size it should be explained to avoid confusion and disappointment) along with some other minor mishaps. After receiving the service we received we tipped according to service, which was POOR. Now while sitting and enjoying the rest of our drinks, management had the audacity to approach our table to ask why we left the amount of tip we left. First off, that is probably the most unprofessional way to treat a table after spending money on the FOOD and to judge off a tip that we based off of service was uncalled for and definitely shouldn't be welcome in a restaurant environment. should definitely think twice about approaching the ONLY minority table there, when in fact the main FOCUS is the Customer NOT the percentage of tip the server deserved! Remind you I am a server and knows what it takes to serve and knows what is deserved. The whole situation made our table of 6 very uncomfortable and uneasy. Any guest asking a server anything shouldn't feel like they're bothering them.. not a warm welcome accompanied by bad service.. wont be there again and wouldn't recommend unless you want some good hummus and/or your white lol",

For dinner, we had chicken tenderloin, a protein plate, a poke bowl, and a Rueben. Everything was absolutely delicious, and I especially recommend the Rueben! The best I've had in Phoenix! However, the greatest part of the entire experience was the service. Not only did we receive our food quickly, but they went out of their way to make sure our drinks never remained empty for long.

Awesome. We were at a table eating when this guy at the bar kept leaning and trying to set his drink on our table for a few minutes. Finally, he fully stumbled ONTO our table. We told him to get his self together. Of course he got in my friend's face, trying to fight him. Once he saw how tall my friend was, his friends quickly jumped in to break it up. His friend explained that he was \"part owner\" of the bar. Uhm...what percentage are we talking here? He's a child. Imagine a bar ran by the worst people you knew from college and all their friends go there. That's The Porch. Can't these people go to Mill Ave and Old Town where they belong?

It took over 30 minutes for our drinks to come (one of which was the wrong drink) and the food came out about 10 minutes apart, with another order that had been messed up.  Worst of all there was zero accountability.  All the employees seemed to know the service was horrible, but didn't care or do anything about it.  Our first waitress handed our table off mid service because she had forgotten the entire order since she didn't bother to write it down.  The manager was made aware of our issues, but didn't even bother to address our table even though we'd been told he would come over.  And what did we get for this ridiculous meal that took over an hour and a half?   A $180 bill for a table of 4 with two rounds of drinks and lunch.  Save your time and money and don't bother checking this place out.    I've worked in many hospitality environments and I'm very understanding when it comes to service, especially in a new establishment, but this place is a total joke with no excuse for the way we were treated.  I'm actually angry my friends and I wasted any money here (and I've never left a Yelp review in my life-that's how ridiculous this place is).",

First time I went with a friend and it took 45 minutes for our dinner to come out...all we ordered was tacos and a chicken bowl. The chicken in my bowl was extremely over cooked. It was actually hard to cut it was so tough. Second time at the restaurant, my order was wrong and my hubby's \"hand breaded\" chicken tenders tasted more like frozen chicken fingers. He said the chicken tenders at McDonald's are way better and much cheaper. When my correct order arrived, it was pretty bland (med chicken wrap). No flavor and the sweet potato fries were so fried that they were really too crispy and lacked flavor. Once my correct order came out, our bartender disappeared so I wasn't able to ask for any hot sauce to give the wrap some flavor. There is so much potential here but unfortunately it's falling short. Hopefully it will get better. Also, the music is really, really loud so having a conversation is tough. I do hope they can make some changes to their quality of food and service.",

Today I noticed they were open, so my colleague and myself decided to stop in for lunch. Great decision. We started off with the shrimp ceviche. It was super fresh and had just the right amount of kick with the peppers. My colleague had a mason jar salad which she enjoyed, but the real winner was the Ahi Poke I had. The tuna had that deep red color, meaning it was super fresh. The sticky rice was prepared perfectly, and all of the toppings were fresh and delicious. I had to go back to work, so I wasn't able to enjoy their extensive beer selection. I counted 16 taps, about half of them are some of my favorite beers so I see myself coming in for quite a few happy hours in the future. Jess and Allie were spectacular startenders, hope to see them in the future! This is a great addition to Arcadia, glad I'm in walking distance!",

Both times I came my date had the French Dip Burger and its excellent.  The horseradish gives it a great kick.   If the weather is good you can sit outside or grab a table.   We found two seats at the bar on our second visit.   They have lots of TVs to see your favorite game.  Overall like the vibe and decor.  Also make sure you  leave a few extra minutes for parking since they offer valet.",

The manager was super nice trying to get the MLB game we were looking for. He said they didn't have it, but we're soon getting the MLB pkg, so should get all the games. Servers/bartenders have all been really efficient and nice. We do try to avoid coming on Friday & Sat, as it is way too loud and packed. We come during the week which has a more relaxed chill vibe. Also, always great tunes playing!",

Half the rice was crispy and clearly overcooked, dry, and leftover for many hours, 3 pieces of avocado and oddly colored tuna that was not fresh. No water refills until 40 minutes after we arrived. A friend had waffle wings which had so much breading that the breading was  falling off the pieces of chicken. All the fries were very old and overcooked as well. A third friends burger was so overcooked it was hard to chew. If you are charging so much for food then make it that quality otherwise realize you are mediocre awful bar food that needs to be re-priced accordingly. Will not be coming back. I would have asked for a refund If I wasn't with a group of friends.",

I tasted it and it tasted just like a cheeseburger. He said it was bland, no seasoning. Logan our waiter saw that he barely ate it. He told him what he thought. Logan apologized up and down, also about service being slow. But there was a table of ladies in the center that every time Logan walked by, they were asking him to do or get one thing or another which I believe delayed him getting to our table. I saw nothing abnormal with service. Then Eric the manager came over and wanted all of our feedback. Which was awesome. We both talked to him (good and bad) Logan asked us to please come back for another try because he thinks they could make it right.",

We informed our waitress, she was apologetic but didn't offer to comp a drink or really do anything else for us. Sad because we enjoyed the vibe of the place but we won't be back nor recommend.",

We ordered the skinny marg which tasted like it came out of the tap, and although there was ice it tasted warm somehow. The cherry on top was the dead moth we found in our game.

I ordered the same thing as I did on my initial visit. Can you guess it?!? Wings! Wings! Wings!  This time around they were good well (last time they were cold and over cooked). I think the kitchen has finally figured it out so I'm happy I returned.   It's a fun place to visit, they have a patio and indoor setting with a pretty nice TV set up to watch the games. Based on my most recent visit I would now recommend this place. They've stepped their game up.   My disclaimer: The first time I visited I was with a pretty big group. This last time I was with a smaller group and was at the bar. I'm honestly not sure if that made a difference but I could tell from the overall atmosphere that they definitely figured their ish out.",

We all walked up to the hostess and mom friend asked the waitress how long the wait was hostess said about an hour. We told my friend if she wanted to stay, she said way. My friend told the hostess we would like a table and the hostess ignored my friend completely. So I step forward as I see another hostess walking up and I look at her and say we need a table for four then that's when the first hostess said oh I didn't know you wanted a table and I then said yes my friend told very clearly and you ignored her. She didn't say anything to me and felt embarrassed that I said that in front of the other woman. After that we continued to have rude service when we ordered our drinks at the bar. While we are our dinner a manager walked out from the back and asked different if everything was good and he walked by our table and just gave us a dirty look and continued walking. He didn't both to ask if we were doing good. He walked by our table two different times and he just looked at us like we were a piece of trash. After we paid our bill we walked out to leave and the same manager guy walked out behind us and I saw him and told my sister that he followed us out. I said this loud enough for him to hear and he acted like he went out there to talk to the valet guys. That manager guy acted like we stole something from the restaurant.  I have always wanted to here because it looked like a cool place to go. But since it is so close to Scottsdale they treated us like trash. We will not be going to this restaurant again.",

We had four kids with us who ordered the soft pretzel and loved it.  The beer cheese was really good.  The only thing I didn't care for too much were the stereotypical Hooters-esque servers.  Big boobs, exposed bellies - not so much, thanks.  Lots of people are ok with that, which is fine.  It's just something to take note of if you're dining with early-teen boys.  It was a little distracting.  :-)  Parking is really tight.  About 90% of it is valet.  The Porch is still pretty new, so we'll definitely be back to see how it evolves.  It has great potential.",

Our group came in at prime time requesting a table for 8. We were told it would be about a 2hr wait, within 30 min we we're seated.  Our excitement quickly turned to disappointment when we were sat outside next to a large fireplace with 0 TVs in sight. Above the fireplace seemed like a perfect place for a tv. A manager said they haven't put one up yet because they feared it would be vandalized. We made do, occasionally standing up to watch the game on one of the TVs inside.   Our waitress, Christina, was great. She greeted us in a timely manner and quickly brought out waters and drinks for the table. Our table ordered a variety of apps and all were good. The restaurant was busy, but Christina kept our drinks and bellies full. She kept track of everyones separate tabs with ease and did it with a great attitude!

We were happy that it was just as delicious as our last visit! My salmon salad was delicious- with fresh ingredients and a pleasing presentation. My friend had a wrap sandwich that looked huge with yummy fries! I snuck a few!! Thanks for the great dining experience again!!   OMG!! What can I say...Fabulous!!!! Have been driving by curious about the Porch! Well, my gal pal was celebrating a Birthday and requested we try that establishment...Super! We arrived at about 3:30 Thank Goodness cause it's a hopping little spot with a small parking area. Our server Jamie was so welcoming and eager to discuss the menu & restaurant!! We sat outside on an Amazing day and throughly enjoyed ourselves. Great Happy Hour menu for Beer & Nibbles!! We had the poppers and pretzel with fondue!! Both were delicious! We later decided to split the burger that was a happy hour special as well- so yummy!!! It felt like hanging out at a Pals Porch...I loved it and will bring my hi",

The wings are soooooo freaking good, my favorite are the honey chipotle wings, and no they weren't too spicy! My friend that isn't too much of a fan of spicy really liked them too. The wings paired well with their cocktail \"my ex wife's secret\" which I had to have two of!  Just be sure to end the night with their sea salt chocolate chip cookie and thank me later.",

The location is great- walking distance from the Vig and Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers if you're familiar with the area.   The menu has a few good options but I opted for the mason chopped + tossed salad and added grilled chicken . When the waitress brought my food, I noticed there wasn't any chicken but she quickly fixed it. To drink I ordered a new drink on the menu called \"tickle me pink\". It was good- not too sweet at all because of the champagne in it.   The best part about this is the outdoor area. There are games including corn hole, Jenna (life size), connect 4 (life size), and that hook and ring toss game. It also has tv's. My friend's 6 year old son watched tv while he ate and when he finished eating he entertained himself while his mom and I were talking. It's great because I know it's hard taking your kids out when you're trying to have adult time but this environment made it super easy! I also brought my dog and he was loving the outdoor area. The sweet waitress brought him water too :)",

The chopped salad is pre tossed so it's not in separate ingredients SO they add wayyyyyyy more argugala. Not a fan. The change is not great. All of our favorites disappeared. Drinks still good. We probably won't be coming as often anymore because our alternative choices weren't hits. French dip burger was good. Jalapeno poppers: were over stuffed jalapeno that doesn't hold and is flimsy. No textural difference. Overly spicy. So so sad our neighborhood go to place has changed. Please bring back the good stuff!!",

Twinkie has a Kale salad that had a great presentation and I had this huge double wedge salad. I say double wedge as literally two wedges are presented on the plate. It was fantastic and contained grape tomatoes, sauteed onions, chunky blue cheese and thick cut bacon.  This place looks like a good place to catch a game with an ample amount of TV's and drink option set to please both him and her.  The established is very clean and modern. It has very limited parking, so valet was the only option we had. No biggie, a few bucks for a nice guy! I spend that on Starbucks everyday.  The menu was a mixed compilation of American dishes. I will say that the presentations were done well and the quality of the ingredients very fresh. There is a good size patio out front for those nicer evenings and Arizona's cooler months. We dig this area and will be back soon!  #irishcatv2 #twylytephotography #rebelfoodandwine",

The food for us was not great, but not bad either. I will say my Porch Burger was seasoned properly and the bacon was good too. The potato chips with it were really disappointing. They were not fresh made which is OK, but they had no salt or other flavor either. We had the wings for an app and they were unremarkable. My wife had the chicken strips and they were cooked OK but under seasoned. As far as cocktails, the Cabin Fever was unbalanced & sickly sweet. Ty replaced it pronto and didn't bat an eye. The craft beer list is healthy and that was what most of the patrons were drinking so I joined them with a delicious Sculpin IPA. It took us 10 minutes to exit the parking lot as it is just too small for this busy restaurant.",

We came in behind a large crowd and was initially told 35 minutes but the wait turned out to be about 15 mins instead. They have limited options for ppl who only eat seafood, so I always stick to the blackened shrimp tacos! You get 3 for $10 and they're loaded with meat. My husband tried something new and ordered the grilled cheese with turkey and the sweet potato fries on the side. He went on and on about how good it was and ate all of it so I imagine it must have been.",

The chairs are very comfortable and the TVs are mounted at a nice height so your neck doesn't get cramped. In addition, to TV's there is also darts, a giant scrabble board, and a pucks table for your enjoyment.  Happy hour is 5-6:15 pm and features half off appetizers and discounted drinks. However,  I was a bit disappointed with the limited draft selection.  On this visit we shared the Reuben sandwich, chicken panini, Parmesan truffle fries, bruschetta, and pretzels. The food wad good as was the service.  If you're looking for a place to hang out with your friends you should stop by and give \"The Porch\" a try.",

We ordered a rib sandwich and the hot country chicken with jalapeno grits. Everything was good nice flavor. The parmesan fries were nice and crispy. We ordered a couple of cocktails that had jus the right pour. After enjoyed our meals it was time to play some of the outdoor lawn games. You can play cornhole and a giant connect four set up. Inside they have hoops and a few other games. It was the perfect set up to keep people engaged. I really enjoyed the outside area it helped influence our stay for sure along with the drinks.

They are chicken wings and the batter is waffle batter. They then serve a side of syrup that is a bit spicy. Perfect combination of sweet and salty.   We also had the green chili chilaquiles.

The food was not very good and small portions. They \"ran out\" of their ingredients to the drink I ordered - one that was highlighted on their menu. And most frustratingly- they somehow put my son's' order on a separate ticket and it took 20 minutes AFTER the rest of the food arrived and no attempt to make it right by comping, or offering a dessert for the wait. We barely saw out waitress. For a new business to mess up and not ever try to apologize to customers doesn't bode well.   I would have given another start or 2 had the waitress been more apologetic or a manager had come to apologize. But I guess customer service is not that important.  I hope it improves.",

I especially loved the outside patio with picnic tables, swings, and games. We can't wait to head back in the evening to check out the nightlife side of this place!! Parking is tough, but complimentary valet parking took care of that for us. We learned the owners also run The Bevvy in Scottsdale, more of a sports bar, so heading there over the weekend!!",

I get they need to fit in more people than they have parking spots for, but it's just ridiculous when their recommended self parking area is a block away and you have to cross a street to get to the restaurant. Our waiter was so-so, we did not get a lot of attention, he only took our order and then took our plates. My drink was on the happy hour list (not a great happy hour, cocktails are $8) and it came in a reusable red solo cup. I did not like it.... I'm not paying $8 for a cocktail that looks like I mixed it in the back yard of a frat party. It was very fruity, artifically sweet, and not memorable. I envied the mason jar cocktails going by me on trays as those were much prettier. We shared fried pickles and they were fine. The dipping sauce wasn't my favorite. Won't be back unless they get a better priced happy hour. There are equally nice places in Phoenix with cheaper happy hours.",

I will say that the drinks and food are pretty pricey as I paid $12 for a jack and Coke  which to me is kind of expensive for a sports bar so beware that you may have to spend a little bit more money then you went to anticipate  Me and my friend ordered the chicken wings and the pork belly nachos. Nachos were not that great as the meat was kind of cold and I felt like it was lacking in the cheese sauce but the wings were absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend the golden barbecue wings , SO good! They were cooked really well, super tender, and the sauce was so delicious! We also ordered the hot wings which were good but not the best I've ever had. Our waiter was really sweet! He did not mess up our order and got our drinks /food out to us promptly for a Friday night!   I definitely think that this place has great potential, as it had a super cool ambience and everyone was upbeat.

I almost wanted to ask him if he had some life crisis going on that made him seem so miserable about the job of serving cocktails but I felt like that was rude to ask. With me having my one day off of not being a bartender I was looking forward to having a nice relaxed bar experience, but sadly didn't go as smooth. Thank you to the rest of the staff that went out of their way to help my group out and give us a good time!",

The atmosphere is nice, plenty of room with big booths and table sitting inside and out. The bar also has great seating with comfy chairs which is always a plus.    The service was a bit slow considering it wasn't busy. The server was friendly but in the beginning was very attentive. Food came out promptly which was great.    The food was delicious! To start we order the nachos (there was only two of us) and it was a big plate. The chips were very crispy and didn't get soggy under the queso cheese. I love short rib and the meat was cooked perfectly, it was tender and flavorful. Definitely would order again. For the entree I had the grilled chicken panini. At first I was expecting it to be spicy because of the chipotle mayo but they must use lemon in the avocado because it had strong citrus hints. Overall pretty tasty.",

I had the green Chile pork tacos and they were good. The cocktail I had, the Cabin Fever, was pretty gross. It was basically a way-too-sweet old fashioned. I can imagine that it's a fun bar to go to, but as a place to eat dinner it was subpar, especially considering that it is close to a number of better places which are at the same price point. Because of that, I won't be returning to The Porch.",

Terrific concept-neighborhood hangout/sports bar-with fun front yard of artificial grass, retro-y red & white outdoor furniture & lawn games. Lots of tvs that hubby will like. D, a vegetarian, said she was starving and ordered 2 kinds of bruschetta & a side salad. I ordered the fig and goat cheese salad. While the plump burrata w/ pesto bruschetta looked amazing, D couldn't get a knife through the rock-hard bread part. As the other bruschetta was scorched black, she didn't even try to tackle it so asked the very nice waitress to send it back. Another order came back quickly, this time not so blackened but the crust was just as impossible to bite that D was afraid she'd crack a tooth. Thankfully, that was taken off our bill. Her dinky side house salad for $5 was served in such a small little bowl that made it awkward to eat. Meanwhile, my salad had beautiful little fresh figs on a bed of greens with pickled red onions and little pea-sized lumps of white cheese that really tasted like bland feta rather than \"goat cheese.\" Guess I was expecting larger clumps of creamy, tangy goat cheese. I know feta sometimes is made with sheep's and goat's milk, but it's not the same as \"goat cheese.\" Size of salad & ingredients not worth the $12. Felt bad that D went away still hungry, but I'm willing to try again in the future.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to this spot opening for a while!  I live right down the street and drive by it every day.  I went last night with my husband, sister and bro-in-law, and was truly disappointed.  Granted, this is their \"soft opening weekend,\" but you'd think they would strive even more to make a good impression.  We were all truly disappointed in this place.  First off, the service was super slow (our server was very friendly) but overall the service was slow, they take an order and disappear for 20 minutes, ask for more water and wait another 20 minutes.  Our table ordered two cocktails, an old fashioned and a manhattan, both were pretty bad.  The Manhattan was sent back and a beer ordered in its place because clearly this is more of a beer hangout place than a place to order cocktails.  My sister asked if they could make a hot toddy and the server said that the bartenders could make one as long as she found hot water for them.  The server asked the kitchen if they could get her some hot water and the answer of course was NO.  What the heck!? How hard is it to get someone some hot water??  Again, i know this is just he first few \"soft opening\" days but still; come on!  Nothing about this place made a good impression.  Oh, and the cocktails are all priced at $11-$13, no thank you considering the cocktails we had were pretty terrible.     My disappointment with this is that on their street sign it says \"food, cocktails, games, sports,\" so don't advertise yourself as a \"cocktails\" place if you can't deliver.  The whole concept is cool, a place to hang out, games etc, but not impressed with the slow service, poor drinks at high prices for a place like this (the Vig next door is a very similar spot and you can count on yummy drinks at lower prices) and the kitchen not being at all accommodating.  Coincidentally we ended up going to the Vig afterward and they were able to get my sister a pot of hot tea, honey and bourbon=hot toddy.  I honestly don't think I'll come here again, so sad because it looked like a cool place to hang out.",

She tells the server I don't think this is thousand island it's too spicy and he said oh ya we don't have thousand island so I brought you the closest thing to it.

There were five of us and between us all we ordered the Caesar salad, pretzels, potato soup, Mediterranean wrap, and the wings. Everything we had was very delicious and prepared perfectly. We were also there for happy hour, which was a fantastic deal (sculpins for $4.50?? Sign us up!) I should also note that our service was top notch! I wish I had taken down our server's name because she was awesome. Very attentive (but not overly so), and had a fun and bubbly personality. Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely be back! :)",

My better half had the fish tacos which she loved, fresh fish and ingredients used and a generous but not over generous portions served (perfect amount of food)  However my bacon cheeseburger I ordered arrived raw in the middle ( I wasn't asked how I'd like my burger) and the bottom of the bun was soaked in grease, and not up to the standard it should have been. I sent my food back and was waiting a good 15 minutes for a properly cooked burger to arrive back at our table, by then my wife had finished and my hunger had surpassed, I asked my waiter to box it up for me to take with me. I was given this part of the meal for free by the concerned manager, he was apologetic and seemed disappointed. I think it was a one off Bad burger experience and I was the unlucky person that day. I ate the burger at home shortly after, it was now over cooked, I wasn't surprised maybe that was karma for the complaint.  I haven't been back as yet, but never say never.",

    "text": "So much potential, with the indoor/outdoor setup and great location. The kids menu is hilarious, and helped me convince my 8yo girl to give it a shot. Potential is where it stopped...   Was a Saturday afternoon several weeks ago. Not crowded but several tables. We got seated outside right away, and the service ended there. 2 adults and a kid sat for 10-15 minutes without anyone stopping by. Not even waters.  The weird thing is there was an abundance of servers ambling about and hanging inside by the bar. Other tables were looking around in wonderment as well. There is no way anyone here received any sort of serious training (or someone is slipping Versed into their staff meals). And where was the floor manager? There should have been one there with a bullwhip, riding herd. We finally got service when we grabbed a passing \"meallenial\" and begged for waters and service.  Our waitress was nice, if a little distracted. Drinks and food came out in decent time. Getting refills was another battle. FYI, Porch, that's how you make money--serve til people are content and turn that shit.  So, food. Was adequately prepared, but the basic betch quality of the ingredients conjured images of the Sysco truck out back delivering frozen burger patties. Nothing stood out as thoughtful, except the poached eggs on the avocado toast.  Really want to see this place step it up and make it. But if it weren't for the abundance of puppies, the nice weather, and running into some friends, we would have fled after the initial diss.  Will give it one more try if I hear there are improvements. C'mon, Porch! Rootin for ya!",

    "text": "Friends and I checked out this place last night. We were looking for something new to try, as our usual Arcadia stops are always good, but wanted to expand our taste a bit. At first glance the atmosphere is pretty nice, with lots of seating and a warm fire going. I came in after my friends, so not really sure about the seating situation, but I'd assume its a \"seat yourself\" since we just walked to a table and sat down.   Our server was friendly and brought us waters and menus right away. The food looked pretty good, and the menu variety has a lot of options. None of us were drinking, but the drink menus also looked pretty tasty, with lots of craft beers and spirits available.   I couldn't decide between the Porch Protein or Border bowl, as both sounded tasty, so with help from my server, decided on the Border Bowl. We also ordered some fried pickle spears to go with our meal. The fried pickles came out first, and the comeback sauce was tasty, but I definitely prefer pickle chips vs. the spears, but still, fried pickles are fried pickles, and they  good.  As for the border bowl, this is where it gets disappointing. The bowl came out and looked pretty good, but I was confused about the food itself. The actual bowl was cold, the chicken and rice were room temp, and the pico, avocado, and beans were cold. Is this supposed to be a warm meal or a cold meal? I'm confused. The beans were tough and seemed like they came straight from the can without being warmed. The rice was not crunchy, but also wasn't fully cooked. The chicken was tough and although the flavor was okay, still not hot, or even warm. I didn't mention anything to our server but really wish I had anyway. I'm not one to complain at a restaurant because when I was younger I too was a server. I would have to say though, after the food experience, I would probably not come back for more. This bowl could use some improving, and definitely wasn't worth the $16.",

I just feel like it is should maybe be in one designated area. As I was eating dinner, a dog walked under my chair and licked my leg. It was just weird as I was trying to have dinner.

We had a large group- which I know from past serving experience can sometimes be a pain...  Our server, Ellie was SO amazing when it came to accommodating everyone at our table. I can't say enough great things about her! We were so appreciative of how attentive she was to our table's needs and always responded to a request in a positive, sincere manner. Kindness goes a long way in the service industry, so thank you to Ellie for being so wonderful and kind-we will definitely be back!",

And cute as hell. He, taught us the trick of how to play the Bimini Ring Toss game, knew the restaurants food and drink menu quite effectively and helped me, a hard-to-decide type of person to order the perfect dinner and drink. The Border bowl and the meatloaf dishes are absolutely delicious. The Jungle Juice drink took me back to my high school days but this drink tasted so much better lol.  Thanks for a terrific time Logan and The Porch.",

They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My date got the grilled cheese with prime rib and honestly I kind of wished that I did as well.  Not only did it look amazing it tasted like a slice of heaven!   Four stars because the staff wasn't very personable.  But that's definitely not going to stop me from coming back!",

During this time my server was at a table on her cell phone hanging out with other employees... An employee was dancing on my server while I continued to wait for the bbq sauce.   I had to get up and go to the table of employees to ask for me check. The server replied that she was now off and I had a new server because she was in a \" social media meeting \"  unfortunately I never was introduced to this new server and they never checked on my table.

There is nothing special about this place which is just too bad. Just basic.  Drinks are served in plastic glasses which in itself is not necessarily a problem, the the dirty water spots are. Also, please use short straws in short glasses. I saw them on the other side of the bar but got a super awkward long straw in my drink. Water was served in a rocks glass not a normal water glass like everyone else at the bar.  I do like the bars stools and that they are not crammed together giving people some space.   Hopefully it's just growing pains but I have a sneaky suspicion it's not.",

It's not too noisy though like cold beer and cheeseburgers across the street can get sometimes where I can hear the person next to me because of the TV commercials.  Pros 1.Entertaining 2.Great staff 3. Bartenders know their stuff 4. Plenty of seating  Now to the cons.....  1. Parking but they have great parking valets 2. The food is never the same twice 3. They need another new cook cause if your cook tells you he is\"trying new things\" while your staff says yeah not sure why they changed it something isn't right. 4. Fried pickles should be sliced not whole dang pickles. ITS A JOKE. They don't cook the same way and no one else makes them that way. The skin in on the bottom of the pickle and when you bit into a whole one you pull the pickle out of the fried part and you end up with one or the other. 5. Never has the fried grilled cheese tasted the same as the first time I got it. Its either 90%cheese 10%short rib or the opposite but never a blend like a sandwich should be.  So besides the fact that the new \"chef\" cant fry a pickle or make a grilled cheese this place is great for a meet up or to catch a game.",

Absolut, Veev acai liquor, berries, mint, ginger beer ... A winner!  Also pleasing was that I was able to get the avocado protein bowl and sub in more veggies for the eggs, which made the dish vegan. Woohoo!  I always ask really kindly if there's any butter or if it would be an issue to make the dish vegan, and the server was great about it.  It was a bowl of veggies, potatoes, house-made sriracha, avocado and couscous. Loved it.  Probably one of the better and fresher food dishes on the menu.   All in all, good experience!",

    "text": "Where do I begin? The best part of the night was the valet guy...super friendly. Thats where it ended.  We asked for a table for two. The hostess tried to put us at some ridiculous little table by the bathroom right underneath the speaker.  I refused the table and she said I couldn't  give us Any of the vacant four tops.  Best option we settled for outside. They gave us two chairs with a little rickety IKEA low table. It about fell over at least three times. We complained, but our drink girl said ....that's what we do here and didn't even offer to get us a better table. It was cold outside but there were only three heaters. Took twenty minute to get someone to take a drink order, then another 20 to get the drinks. We have still not been offered food service. Finally got our drinks......my wine was a 3 oz pour for $12. My guy got a Manhattan for $12 it was not good and only about 3 oz. Food menu is nothing special .....Salads, burgers , wings, and pork bellies. I got a burger...it was slimy...full of sauce....every time took a bite of it everything squished out. My fries were cold when I got them, But nobody ever came back to check on us so that I could send them back. When she finally came back 30 minutes later she said she would give me some new hot fries but I told her I was done eating.  She did apologize or seem to care much at all.  We just opted for our tab and left.  When we went to retrieve our car at valet they were so busy that they brought our car up and took off to retrieve other cars. They didn't even wait for their tip.  Weird!!  The service was off the chart horrible. The menu is weird and the drink prices are ridiculous.  Even though it looks like a cool place music was ridiculously loud and there was no variety. They played a very consistent old , loud rock 'n' roll genre. I would not go back And give this place a second chance. The food was bad but the service was worse.",

Plush leather barstools with a comfortable back-rest allows me to pull up my lap top and complete some work at lunch.  And if I run low on my computer battery they have electrical outlets throughout the bar (just look under the table) for recharge! The $7.00 lunch specials every Mon-Fri are delicious, and so is their entire menu!  I am a huge fan of there protein rich bowls, and when I am feeling \"sassy\" on the weekend I order the \"Nashville Hot Chicken Dinner.\"  Lastly, the staff is great!  Friendly, service-oriented, and professional.  I spend most my days at this joint for lunch.  Kerry seems to be the main bar keeper/server when I am in and she is great.  Kerry encompasses all the professionalism I wrote above.  For this... The Porch makes the top of my favorites for a great bar/joint",

Not only were we happy with the food but the service from the hunk of a manager really put the icing on the cake.

Assuming the negative comments about this place were accurate, I'd commend management on their ability to improve services to correct deficiencies noted from these 'yelpers'.  My wife and I had a great experience at this new restaurant.  We went in during peak hours at around 6:30 pm on a Saturday and didn't have any issues with service - we inherently expected a slight delay because it is a new restaurant and we went in during peak hours, but it wasn't bad at all.  Quality of the food and drinks was great and prices weren't bad for the Arcadia area.  Bar tenders and servers were pleasant and attentive.  Ultimately, this restaurant had great vibes with games and tvs, along with good quality food, drinks, and services.",

Their vast food menu allows for all different taste buds. The vibe of The Porch is electric and creates a positive and uplifting environment for all.

I feel that Porch allows for diversity which Arcadia has needed for over 20 years. Super stoked on this place and know it will only succeed and bring fun to many different people.",

Lots of games  etc. in the long run E/Allie was spot on and we will be back!! Good luck guys! Love this bar and hope she serves us again!",

We just came to watch our favorite team, have some drinks, eat some food, and we felt like we were back at a sloppy college bar. Absolutely ridiculous.",

    "text": "This place sucks. We live very close by so we often walk to the places on this corner. The first time we came, we only had a couple appetizers and drinks and it was ok. And then the second time, our waiter was basically non-existent so we ended up having to ask for him and he still took forever to come around and the place wasn't even busy. Because of that we ended up not ordering food and asking for the check when he finally came around. Today, we decided to get them another chance for brunch and again we were not given any service. The hostess sat us but nobody ever came to take our order even though the place wasn't even busy. So needless to say, we got up and left and went to another restaurant nearby.",
