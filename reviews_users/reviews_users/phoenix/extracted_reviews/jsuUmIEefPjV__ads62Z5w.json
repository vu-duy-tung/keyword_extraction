Bloody Mary is pretty spicy, but mimosas were good too, and only $5 each.

The bar was packed with patrons along the left side. There were about three small tables along the right wall. There is NO place to stand and wait. It was rather uncomfortable for a moment while someone noticed us.   There is a small, very dark dining room to the right as you first walk in. We were informed to sit wherever we like. This room had one very large table (room for 10 I believe), and two 4 tops. They had extra chairs, so they may be able to squeeze in more. NO high chairs.   They do not split the dish, but they will bring out an extra plate to allow you to split it yourself. We split the tenderloin benedict. Omg. This was a dish with two 3 oz filet mignon, eggs, hollandaise, and a side of pinto beans and potatoes. The tenderloins were so amazing, we could cut them with a butter knife. The beans were so flavorful, I did not realize pinto beans could taste so good. The service was incredible. The wait staff definitely knows what they are doing.   The food and service is 5 stars. The awkwardness that we felt when we first walked in brings our scoring to 4.",

Seating is VERY limited no matter the size of your group. They're are 3 tables in the bar and an dining room that has 2 additional tables. One table is a \"community\" table. We sat at the community table and it was a lot of fun. Our kids are well behaved and it wasn't long before us and the 2 other groups were chatting it up. The staff was attentive and made sure we all had a great time. Only thing that keeps it from a 5 star is it was a little stuffy inside but to be fair it's the dead of summer in Phoenix. I'll be sure to add this to the list of places I recommend to others",

We booked a private dining room for a company party and were informed the day of the party that there was another group in the room but they have an \"even better\" private dining room that is right near a bathroom and we will love it!  We reluctantly agreed, as we had nowhere else to take our employees for our annual company holiday party.  The \"private dining room\" was 2 tables in the back of the noisy restaurant right by a kitchen and gross bathroom. Throughout the night, customers from the bar passed through our group on the way to the bathroom (which we had to wait in line to use).  We were overcharged inflated contract private dining room rates (even though we were kicked out of our reservation for said room), service was bad, the server was argumentative and the food was barely warm and tasted terrible.  Steaks were cooked wrong and \"tenderloin\" was more like some tough sirloin I couldn't cut through. Sauces were not good and also luke-warm.  Sadly, we won't be back again.",

    "text": "I came here on a suggestion from one of the guys at Magnums.  He said it was a place I had to experience, and I had a lazy Saturday so I decided I'd hit it up.  It's the best place you never knew existed. I did all the normal preparation, look it up, get the intersection and drive.  I felt I knew where it was as it's astonishingly close to the Whining Pig, another place one must visit if in Phoenix. So I drove the 20 minutes it took to get there, took a right on to 16th and a few blocks later I turned around and went to the strip mall to park and look it up with my GPS.  I was pulling out of my parkingspot before I noticed the address, then looked at the door I had parked in front of.  I was there and didn't even know I was.  Unashamed, I drove around the complex, then took a parking spot nearby. I walked in, taking careful notice of the sign that said \"Sorry, we're open\". What I expected the interior to be like was a dive bar that you'd only go with a few chums to have a beverage and a few beers.  What I found was quite different. The interior was dark, the blinds hid the blinding Phoenix sun and a large bar lined the wall to the left of the door.  Candles were on the tables, and the earthy fire stove helped to illuminate the backdrop.  It was mid afternoon, so the cooks were doing prepwork for the evening, and there were a series of chickens being rotiserried over a wood fire.  The bartender, she was beautiful, although I never caught her name, came to me and asked what I wanted. I had read prior sites on this place and saw it was listed as the best bloody mary in town.  Therefore I asked \"I heard this place has the best bloody mary's in town?\" To which she replied, \"Of course.\"   I eagerly ordered one plus a water.  I'm a bloody mary lover, so I've learned each place has it's own flavor to it's bloody mary, and sometimes water helps. The concoction was placed in front of me, and I ordered the pork shoulder.  Now one cannot complain about a hand made bloody mary, and this one was good.  It had the traditional celery and an addition of pickled asparagus.  The two mingled well with the spicy bloody, which was served with a shot of beer.  It was delicious, but when compared with Mort's back home, I was missing a beef jerky in it too. Soon a large lump of pig flesh with beans and rice was placed infront of me.  Once again it was well spiced, with a plethora of delicious porky flavor to it.  I didn't need a knife to eat it as tender as it was. I gnawed at the pork until I was thanksgiving full.  You know that fullness, the one where you don't have any more room in your gastric tract for anything else or you may burst. Knowing full well that the best course of action was to retreat and take a nap, I couldn't help but order a unique beer to the region. They had one named \"Leg Humper\" and as that's one of my old gamer nicknames, I had to have it.  The mellow brew had a hint of yeasty sweetness to it.  Needless to say, the trip back was miserable.  I was on the verge of popping, and was carefully driving so as not to upset the delicate balance I had achieved in settling into my drivers' seat. I kind of feel guilty about posting on this place, as it seems to enjoy it's clandestine anonymity, for goodness sake, they didn't even put a sign out for it.  However, something this good shouldn't be hidden.  Instead I'll post it and hope that I can find a seat next time I show up.  Oh yes, there will be a next time.  Things this good are hard to pass up!",

Not only it si secluded and somewhat exclusive, when one has managed to get a seat in a small booth-like table with no space - but I like it. It makes me feel like I am in a place that is not a franchise (if it is, I don't want to know). This establishment is austere without being uncouth in any way, like a diamond in the rough that you do not want to polish.   The servers are amazing. Personable and friendly. On top of their shit, and not too busy to squeeze in a joke here and there. The beer list is not extensive, but it works. The food menu is nice. Overall this is my kind of place. I would come here often if I didn't have a decent drive associated with it. The bathroom is one coed bathroom located in the kitchen. This is good and bad, it feels odd walking into the kitchen - but I like that you can walk into the kitchen. A feel of transparency to see what is going on in here.   What I bring home from my visit is the service, and the feel of the place. Both are top notch. Yes, there are things that I could suggest that would improve my experience - but i'd rather not. I want to leave this place as I found it and hope that they do not change.",

So, it's really a New Mexican fusion with lots of fresh fish and always excellent specials. The Hideaway is petite, though with an extra room available on brunch- filled weekends. The wait for brunch on the weekends can be lengthy if you're more than two, but it's worth it. The food is great, and I recommend sharing a plate unless you plan on leftovers.  I frequent this place and have only two gripes, otherwise would have given 5 stars.  1.) cocktails are outrageous. $10 for a manhattan otr.  2.) more than once I've seen a cook handle raw food without gloves and have sent it back due to this, so keep an eye out.

Hubby had asada Acado platter said it was really spicey and liked my dish better. Cousin had chile relleno and said it was ok but he's had better.

It originally branched off from the old Richardson's that burned down a couple of years ago.  The menu offers a great variety of some delicious New Mexican food.  The atmosphere here is great but place is very small, although they do have a larger room for a bigger party off to the right when you walk in.  The larger room an be reserved for special occasions with a $500 deposit.  I personally enjoy having Sunday brunch here early with my parents or a couple of my closest girlfriends.  They offer a $5 bloody mary or mimosa all day Sunday!",

    "text": "Oscar Mike Golf!  With a side of Whiskey, Tango, Foxtrot.  How is this so good.  How am I summoning the willpower to type as I am floating in a wonderful world where there is no such thing as war, disease, corrupt politicians.  Where there are no people who cut you off on the I-10 only to realize they don't need to and promptly go back to their lane, and then realize they wanted back into my lane after all, giving my brakes the workout of their lives, damn you random teenager.   I give my heartfelt thanks to whatever noble bovine prince gave up his life so that I might have such a wonderful, spectacular meal.  And also my thanks to Dick's Hideaway, for giving me this moment to revel in this dream world composed of nothing but delicious flavors and complete food coma.  True to its name, Dick's Hideaway has no signage proclaiming its location, quietly residing on the northwest corner of 16th St and Bethany Home Road.  Of course, it needs no signage either, with its legions of fans and great reviews.  Walking in today around 1pm, the bar was full, and there were only 3 tables in the main room, but our server let us use a table/booth in the adjoining room.  It was a little daunting having this room to ourselves, surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine, but the comfortable booth we were in helped, with pillows bountiful in number and cushy, as well as the flat screen on ESPN.  Having been here numerous times but not for nearly a year, I called up a number of old favorites, getting the Pasta Heidi, Carne Adovada, and the Richardson's combination.  Pasta Heidi was a beautifully presented and tasting dish, with green chile linguine covered in an addicting chipotle cream sauce, topped with grilled chicken.  This hit all the right notes, in terms of texture re: the linguine, creaminess of the sauce, lingering spicyness of the chipotle, tenderness of the chicken.  The tortilla that lined the bowl underneath was given no mercy, as it had soaked up all the wonderfulness above it.    Carne Adovada was the previously alluded to pinnacle of porcine expression.  Whereas the Pasta Heidi was wonderful with multiple levels of flavor woven together in harmony, this was more in your face with each aspect fighting to the forefront.  An initial smokiness greets you when tongue meets pork, followed by spiciness of the red chile sauce and savoriness of perfectly cooked, ridiculously tender pork, and returning once more to the smoky.  There has never been a war so happily fought as the one these flavors battled for supremacy over your taste buds.  You might be confused for a moment after that first bite, asking yourself did that really just happen?  I assure you, it did, and to take another bite.  Conversation died off at the table as we were quietly in awe of these dish.  Finally, the combination plate I ordered had asparagus, chicken enchiladas in green chile sauce, and a single portion of eggs benedict.  The asparagus was competently prepared as was the chicken enchiladas, but lacking the depth of flavors found in the other dishes.  The eggs benedict however was superlative in its own right, with a perfectly poached egg on top.  A gentle tap with my fork had that yolk spreading like golden bliss over beef tenderloin and english muffin, all crowned with a jalapeno-infused Hollandaise sauce.    With these 3 entrees and coffee, iced tea, and sprite, it came out to be $57, so this restaurant could never be called cheap, but even with tip bringing it to $72, I would say that after leaving I feel we still got the better of this exchange.  Dick's Hideaway.  I bow to you in humble appreciation, and will return for more time and time again.",

It may be wonderful for lunch or dinner, but we had by far the worst breakfast and the worst service ever experienced in the Valley.  I might note that we arrived at 7:30AM and were by ourselves in the dining room.  You would think that because we were early the service would be wonderful.  Not so!!  We had to go and find out waitress to refill our coffee.   She served toast but forgot to bring jelly to the table.  Everything we ordered was either wrong or undercooked.  One person in our party sent her food back to be cooked; the other was so disgusted with the appearance of the raw eggs (in her omelet) that she chose just to eat the toast and forget the eggs.    The \"special\" that day was a crab omelet.  Unfortunately the omelets that we ordered tasted like fish, whether we wanted it or not.  (We didn't)    We had a very hard time locating the restaurant, and would have been much better off  if we had never found it and went somewhere else.  Terrible experience!!",

It's located next to Luci's Healthy Marketplace so if you see that, you're good.  They have this amazing Carne Adovada so make sure you don't miss it (this is the sole reason for the 5 stars).  We came here for breakfast on our way through Phoenix thanks to fellow yelpers and it did not disappoint.  We got the Carne Adovada and Eggs, and the New Mexico Burger.  The Carne Adovada was delicious.  There is no other way to describe it.  If you go here, this is what you need to order.  The hash browns were pretty limp and had a weird, bitter taste to them...not sure if it was the oil they were using or what, but I was pretty disappointed...I really wanted hash browns!  The New Mexico burger was pretty good and did not have the kick I expected.  It was a little bland though so I had to use some of the ketchup that came with my fries.  The fries were tasty and crispy so it made up for the hash browns...somewhat.    So, why the 5 stars?  The Carne Adovada...it's out of this world.",

    "text": "They were onto something when they named this place Dick's Hideaway. My friend and I felt like we were on a treasure hunt to find this hidden gem. We passed it probably 3 times as it is disguised with a sign that says \"Additional Parking in Rear\". No sign with their name but they are right next door to Luci's Grocery Store on the Northwest corner of 16th Street and Bethany Home.  Once we finally found the speak-easy like restaurant we were surprised at how small it was. There was a bar section that could seat a max of 10 people and then 3 booths against the wall. There was a room next door with an extensive wine cellar and tables big enough for 6-8 people. The room was dimly lit to give it an intimate feel but not too gag-me-with-a-spoon romantic as there were several flat screen TVs with the DBack's game on. They have a wood burning stove that gives the restaurant a campfire smell...making it seem that you're in the middle of nowhere in the wild west at a divey saloon (but much more classy).  On to the good stuff...I had researched the menu prior to getting there to give myself an idea of what they had. I was excited to see that they had breakfast and then sorely disappointed when I found out it's only served until 4 PM. Yelp considers this place Tex-Mex but I would have to disagree and say that it's definitely got a taste of the 505 (New Mexico speak for those of you that aren't in the know).  As I mentioned in my previous review, whenever I go to Mexican style restaurants, I will judge them by their enchiladas. I decided to be on the wild side tonight and try something different. I went with the Carne Adovada since the server advised it was spicy and I like it hot and a glass of the Malbec. My friend opted to get the red, white, and blue enchiladas.  While I normally love Malbecs, this one was more on the \"eh\" scale as it was too earthy and overly ambitious with the tannins. So if you like a strong red wine, this one is for you!  We got our food and they were not joking when they said the plate was hot. You can get third degree burns from those steel embossed cowboy-like plates. Also, if you are watching your calories or trying to control your portions...this is definitely not the place as the servings could feed two people.   The Carne Adovada was delicious...the meat was tender, juicy, with a red chile kick and topped with a layer of melted gooey cheddar cheese. The rice and beans were tasty and the homemade tortilla made the meal complete. My friend let me try her enchiladas and let me tell you - they do not disappoint! Next time I will definitely be getting those!  We were in a food coma getting ready to go home and put on the stretchy pants when we were informed that there was a massive dust storm taking over metro Phoenix. I felt like I was back in CO experiencing a blizzard of sand. So we decided to stick around for a bit longer. Good thing we did because we wouldn't have been able to try, by far, the greatest flan I've ever tried. Dare I say better than my mom's flan? Gasp...I would dare say so! The flan was delicately creamy with just the perfect amount of sweetness in every bite. I've never had a flan that was a mousse-like texture and not custardly. Hope you like flan cuz that's the only dessert they have there!  Overall, I give Dick's Hideaway a 4 because I can't give them a 4.5. The service was great and our server was friendly. The food, ambiance, and good company made the night. I will most definitely be returning to the hideaway known as Dick's.",

My daughter and I stopped in before heading for the airport, and were greeted and seated immediately. The community tables were a little unusual, but we had nice, albeit brief, conversations with others seated before and after us. The huevos rancheros were fantastic, with just the right amount of warmth, and the New Mexico sausage is not to be missed. My daughter had blueberry pancakes, and found them light, fluffy, and flavorful. The only downside was the service. While it was good, it was a little confusing with several servers offering coffee refills - sometimes infrequently, and once 3 times on 3 minutes. Value was good for the money. I will have to stop again for a lunch or dinner.",

The service is stellar and the bartenders are fun. The wait staff will sit down and chat with you and take your order in the tightest spaces since the wait is typically 30-45 minutes for brunch.

If you are from out of town, get there early and expect to have a hard time finding this place (no signs) and know that you might have to wait - you can drink while you wait and the vibe is fun and engaging.  I am not sure I would recommend this for toddlers, it's tough for them to wait that long - but the staff will ensure that no matter who you are - you are comfortable and well taken care of while you wait!~ TRUST GOOGLE.

Ruminating over the smells and tastes distinctly New Mexico.  It's in the hands. Blood of the Earth. A hardscrabble Zia sun bleached New Mexico soil.  If you've ever worked with your hands you to understand the wisdom of the earth, of chalk & clay.   It gets in to you; how you think of humus under your fingernails.   It gets in you.   You can feel the minerals hardening your hands. Weighing into your pores. Channeling its way into your bloodline.   How we think of the core of the earth. Out of the toil, the ground was sluiced; Until it yielded.  Hand of the salt. Hand into the Earth.   If you wake up, and you want that taste, that smell-- you'll follow your feet here.   --  P.S.   Oh! And see that guy? That guy right there! The one you always over look. The faceless, nameless perfectionist that cooks, plates and never asks for a thank you.   I watch. I watched him kill a mid-morning, standing-room-only breakfast rush.   He sipped water where he could. Caught his breath where he could. But he never tired.   It was an artwork--a swordsman using a paintbrush instead of a epee.   You study under masters: Socrates & Plinius the elder, Plinius the younger, Aristotle & Archimedes.   I watch cooks.  I've sat here, and I have studied; hoping to learn in a way, some magic by inculcation. Watching to glean some slight of hand; some abracadabra by seasoning.   Hernandez--I'm told that's is his name--I once tipped this man a $100.   Skill is an investment that can not be negotiate.",

    "text": "We came in yesterday from Chandler to celebrate a birthday, and deeply regret making the drive out for such a poor experience.  I will start by saying the food was above average, and it was the service we were disappointed by.  My mother in law has a thick Russian accent, and it can be hard to understand her (especially if it is a bit noisy around.) She was trying to ask our server, Lauren, a few questions about the menu and was given nothing but short and disrespectful answers. As a server, I could see this was a busy Sunday morning and she probably had a lot going on, but you have to be able to take the time to answer your customer's questions. Don't act like we're an inconvenience to you for not knowing your menu!   When our food came out, the food runner put the plates down and I went to move mine closer to myself. Not until after I touched the plate did he mention that they were EXTREMELY hot. I immediately got a blister on my finger. If plates are that hot, you should tell your guests before they even touch the table.  After we paid, we asked Lauren if we could speak to a manager. She told us that she did not have one, and that she could give us the office number. I called yesterday, and have not jeard anything back yet. Doubtful I will.",

    "text": "Dick's Hideaway... it was an adventure here!  So technically we made two stops in here on Friday night.  When we first walked in, it was crowded!  So we made our way across the street for a drink before popping back in because after having a great Bloody Mary with dinner and seeing how this place boasts about having a \"top rated Bloody Mary in the valley,\" I couldn't stop thinking about Dick's!  Plus the Persian with us wanted a creme brulee so we came back.  The bartender even recognized us!  While we awkwardly stood around waiting for some chairs or a table to free up, the bartender came by and asked us what we wanted.  A Bloody Mary and a creme brulee was ordered and I was soon handed my lovely drink along with a small glass of Hair of the Dog beer on the house.  Sweet!  After being bullied into chugging this tasty and smooth brew, I was buzzed.  Even though I might have been a little intoxicated, I still found myself underwhelmed by this \"top rated\" Bloody Mary.  Whaaat!?  I had a much better Bloody Mary like one review ago.  Get on their level!  Kazi H. and I were soon to be escorted to two stools at the bar while the gentlemen we were with still stood awkwardly by the door.  What were they talking about?  My love and I cracked into a nicely caramelized shell and dug into a creamy custard.  While not the best creme brulee ever, I still found myself stealing more and more bites of her abandoned brulee.  More for me, yay!  And then some more stools freed up and our crew came to sit with us.  So the adventure?  Kazi and I stumbled into the private, dark, adjoining dining room to use the restroom.  Let's just say that two girls entered a bathroom with a shower included.  Much shenanigans.  As we made our way back to the bar with her iPhone lighting thew way, we were told that there was another bathroom.  Oops.  Thinking about Dick's makes me smile.  :)",

The food took almost 30 min to arrive, it was delicious but the pancakes were cold. I had teenagers with me. Maybe if it were just the adults that may have been fine. I ordered the carne adovada because it is a specialty of theirs and it was absolutely DELIGHTFUL! ...enjoy",

So, this past weekend I decided to take things up a notch and try out Dick's Hideaway, It had been bookmarked for awhile of places to try so I decided that Saturday was the day to cross this bad boy off my list.   Dick's is hidden, like no sign hidden. Not only is it hidden but it's small. I walked in and there was a good 30 minute wait for a seat at the bar... But I am a firm believer that good things come to those who wait... so I waited! My time finally came and I took my seat at the bar, ordered a bloody mary (delicious by the way!) and perused the Brunch menu (it's served until 4:00pm, so all of you hungover party goers are solid!).   I decided to order the Enchiladas (Shrimp & Green Chilie Pork with red and green sauce) served with 3 sunny side up eggs, beans and a flour tortilla on the side. My first bite was heavenly... The enchiladas were delicious and spicy, my eggs were perfectly cooked, the whole meal was seriously out of this world. And for $14.00 your can be sure you are getting your money worth (I had some serious leftovers!).  Dick's is officially on my brunch rotation! I can't wait to come by and try more of their dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner!",

Once seated at a table I felt I was going to fall on my ass BC of the wobbly stool. The place is super dark so you can barely read the menus or see what your eating.   I ordered the New Mexican platter at $16.00 - tamale, chicken burro enchilada, chili relleno, rice and beans. The chile relleno was so tough I couldn't even cut it with a knife. I had the waitress take it back and the cook said that's the way they are!  My tamale was mostly corn and I've had better at Costco's free samples on weekends and the chicken burro was dry. For the money they charge here i thought my dish was overpriced and lacked taste & quality. With all the authentic Mexican Restaurants in Phoenix I would suggest going elsewhere for comfort and taste. The best thing here was the Stella on tap - ice cold! The service here was good but I felt sorry for the waiters and waitresses BC I saw at least 3 party's leave BC they didn't want to wait.   I would not return here again - overpriced and overrated!",

To explain, I planned to watch the ASU - Arizona Football Game on TV at my house and about an hour before the game started realized that it was being aired on a station my DirecTV doesn't get.   I initially headed over to Zipps at 16th and Bethany Home to catch the game, but quickly realized that everyone in the area had the same idea. So I decided to walk around and see where else I could watch the game. After checking several places I ended up walking by the door to Dick's and noticing that the game was on its TVs.  I had run into a couple of other guys while walking and so I grabbed them and we headed in. However, because the bar was already full, the host said that he could put us in the back room that also had a TV.  The three of us ended up getting our own table next to the fireplace and located within easy site of a big, flat screen, TV in the back room where we got personalized service from the waiter. The service was great and the food and drinks were excellent. What a better experience than being crammed like a sardine into a sports bar! In fact, this may be my new place to watch games when I'm not at the stadium.  Dick's Hideaway, I hope you don't mind if I call you Brad's Hideaway!",

Great menu selection but should be marked as $$$ - food is outrageously expensive ($51 for two drinks, chips and chorizo queso and 6 extremely small mushrooms). Service was good, small setting, very dark and quaint. Decided against having full dinner because of the prices.",

Great suggestion both had a different flavor that added to the overall great taste of the plate.  My wife had the salmon with blueberry salsa and also really enjoyed her meal.

Unfortunately our experience was not the service from two different waiters was straight out rude. Chip on their shoulders and really bad attitudes. Ordered drinks to start and had to send them back twice because they did not get the order right and both times they gave us looks and comments ( attitude again)  about requesting to get what we originally asked for in the first place. I'm always considerate and kind understanding of how the service business is so continued to be light hearted and friendly to the servers but we definitely did not feel the love coming back LOL. The food was okay but not anything to go back again for. Too bad for them! So many great places to go with great food and exceptional service that appreciate the business!",

    "text": "I am not sure who labeled Dick's Tex-Mex, they are WAY off.  It is New Mexican for sure, and AMAZING for certain things and ok for others and not so great for some things.  The atmosphere is fun, quirky and all Dick's!  Wood floors, cozy tables, cool wood bar, fully testosterone driven decor with some Kokopellis  and Coyotes thrown in for good measure.  Dark, smokey (the good kind wafting up from the smoker and the hot hardwood coals on the grill), comfortable and casual.  John Wayne would have felt quite at home here. The wait staff has always been awesome.  In the 12-15 year that I have been going to Dick's I have only had one bad experience with a member of the waitstaff, luckily they are gone now.  The food is great in very specific areas, like the Carne Adovada, Blue Corn Smoked Turkey Enchiladas and Posole which are exceptional.  Smokey, spicy, tender and savory.  Sunday brunch with a plate of Carne Adovada and an over easy egg will make your entire year!  The quesadilla is solid, the hamburger is wonderful, the grilled shrimp and smoked foods rock!  When they stick to the New Mexican cuisine the food is heartwarmingly great.  When they stray... sometimes it works and most of the time it doesn't.  I usually steer away from the fish specials which usually are over breaded, over cooked, over sauced and unfortunate when it is all said and done. I also stay away from the salads which are over worked and heavy.  The wine and beer selection are unexpectedly good for a neighborhood bar setting, but I usually go for the Prickly Pear Margarita!  Needless to say I weigh just under 200 lbs at 6 foot and two are sufficient to make me slur my words a touch, well, more than a touch (even with a full belly of Carne Adovada).  But it I enjoy every minute of the food, atmosphere, drinks and camaraderie at Dick's Hideaway!",

The pork was amazingly tender, the chile spicy and full of roasted flavor, and the eggs were perfectly poached. Come hungry, you'll need the space and want to eat every last bite. I've also had the Fish Trio. The wood-fired grill adds significant flavor to three large portions of fresh fish (mine were Mahi-Mahi, Swordfish, and Salmon), but the flavor pack was in the salsas - a Mango, a Pineapple, and a Red Roasted one. The fruit ones had a nice balance of hot and sweet. The red roasted one was smoky, savory, and spicy without overwhelming. My Bloody Mary was solid, not particularly boozy, and the mix was more on the good spicy, homemade side of life than on the straight outta a bottle grossness. The accompanied shot of beer was much appreciated - Is this an Arizona thing, cause if so, I want to move here.  The atmosphere is quirky - think \"No Kardashians\" and \"Unattended children will be given an espresso and kitten.\" It's cozy and intimate for lunch, and I can imagine it'd be super crowded at dinner. Service was excellent without any issues.",

    "text": "One of the reasons I like Yelp is the opportunity to find small, local places you would seldom be able to find on your own.  Dick's Hideaway last night was such an experience.   You would never find it if you didn't have the actual street address, there is no sign outside!  Once you are inside it's something else.  A long bar facing the open kitchen was packed with at least a dozen diners.  A handful of tables in front of the bar and in an adjacent room were equally packed at 8:45.  I went inside and found no host, when a pleasant guy who turned out to be host, bartender, server asked us to wait on the sidewalk and handed us a short wine list with very good selections.  Before he could deliver our glasses he told us two seats were open at the bar and we were seated.     The menu is predominately New Mexican dishes.  My wife had the Santa Fe style pork enchiladas and I had the New Mexico platter with a chile relleno and chicken burro, all with the green chile sauce.  I have to say, we spent a week in Santa Fe a couple of years ago and the food at Dick's was every bit as good as anywhere we ate in Santa Fe.  Their tiny kitchen cranks out some very good food.   The portions were large; I would recommend splitting a salad.  A couple who sat next to us at the bar split the most expensive item on the menu, rack of lamb at $42, and seemed very happy.     I will definitely plan to visit Dick's again next time we are in Phoenix, fun and good food and wine.",

Just use the Force, follow your instincts, and find the address provided (it is correct).    ** This place is SMALL inside (that seems weird using big letters to emphasize something tiny, but I digress...). This place is so small that if the small bar fills up, you may have to sit at the big community table in the small dining room and eat with strangers -- which may feel a bit awkward at first, but do it anyway. It's kind of fun.    ** The food is very delicious. I had the Tenderloin Benedict and I'm salivating now just thinking about it. Mmmm. The beef was so tender, and the flavors so rich. I also took a taste of the Carne Adovada (which isn't the usual Mexican style), and that is good too. I'd like to come back again and try some more dishes, but I'm definitely a fan already.",

We order a quesadilla the three enchilada plate and the reyeno plate. Wow tons of food. Like three meals for two. Was great. Way spicey.   The only downfall was how loud those plates are as the clearers and servers toss them into the bin.   Love that great things only improve with time.",

I will say I think they use quality ingredients so I understood the price being kinda high, but for the price I can think of a TON of places I would prefer.  I haven't been to New Mexico though so maybe I just don't care for this style of food.  Another thing that bugged after being underwhelmed by the food was getting the bill.  I had ordered the Carne Adovada Benedict which as you can see in the pic is $15 and comes with carne, I was charged $2 extra for carne added on my bill.  I didn't order extra, and it is in the name and description of what I ordered so I don't know how it could be an extra charge.  $17 for one (big) breakfast plate and I was not impressed.",

I prefer a bar stool to watch the magicians at work making meals and I feel that the service is on point since you're pretty much right in front of the staff. If you've never been, familiarize yourself with the menu beforehand BC it can get really busy and this helps you not look like a noob...as well as this expedites getting that piping hot deliciousness in your belly that much more quickly.   Warming: metal serving plates are HOT. They warn you and I've warned you so just don't touch them!  Favorite things about DH:  * They open at 6 am and serve delicious breakfast and lunch options everyday * Bloody Mary's are served with a sidecar of beer, which is how I prefer to make mine at home  * Nice wine list and decent tap selection  * Happy Hour includes tasty bites and $5-6 bevies * Enchiladas. You must have at least one cheese! Chicken, smoked turkey, carnitas are all bomb as well, I prefer the extra Christmas smothering to boot! * Green Chile Stew will burn whatever evil looms from those chilly or soggy rainy AZ days-get it with the egg on top to combat the heat or sissy it up with sour cream like I do when you can't quite hang.  * Atmosphere is more laidback here than the sister restaurants The Rokerij and Richardson's. I personally believe one should never be full on sloppy in public but they won't judge you if you're hungover in your sweat pants and will probably even help cure you! Be sure to check out their aforementioned other restaurants too when you want to enjoy this same NM cuisine love and are feeling more fancy!",

    "text": "Hopped off the plane and immediately started my search for breakfast. Headed towards the cemetery, I opened up the Yelpasphere to aid in my search. Dicks Hideaway with 4.5 stars sounded promising. I headed there. It was well hidden. I drove around the parking lot looking for a sign. I followed the GPS for the last 100 feet leading me to the unmarked doors and a couple of menus on the wall. Upon entering I walked into the darkened room and allowed my eyes to adjust from the bright sunlight. I found myself in a bar and that awkward moment creeped in. So I looked around rather dazed and confused before being approached by the bartender. He asked how he could help, I responded, \" I am told you have great breakfast her.\" He was incredibly accommodating and suggested I try his favorite, Green Chile Benedict. I took his suggestion. He offered some tobassco sauce. My meal arrived. My first glance and impressive response was Wowzers. Huge portions. The metal plate was screaming hot. I zapped myself a couple of times. The first bite went well. The eggs were cooked to perfection, atop the pulled pork. The flavor profiles were insanely good. I say that with a caveat only because of the offered hot sauce. In my opinion, the green chilies brought just the right amount of heat to the party in your mouth. It was all I could do to finish this monstrosity. I finally tapped out and cried uncle. Insane place I enjoyed it. Might consider coming back for dinner before flying out. I saw some great specials on the wall.",

Carne Adobado - absolutely insane! Falls apart with adobado sauce with bite.   Chile relleno - filled with pork chicken cheese or smoked turkey. Definitely get the pork and smoked turkey!  Expect to leave smelling like smoke - the grill is behind the bar but totally worth it.  Phenomenal place to watch a game when it's hot. I don't know how they do it but the place stays super cool in the summer.   Great place to have an private event in the secret room in the back.",

When I say WAY overpriced I'm taking about the $40 pasta entrees that they have? How and why is it so expensive? It doesn't even seem like they use that good of quality ingredients in their stuff that would justify their prices. My wife and I ordered the carne adovada, beef enchiladas, and we started with the calamari. The calamari....abysmal. If you are going to charge $18 for calamari, almost a $20 dollar appetizer not only should it be delicious but the portion should also be pretty large. Unfortunately, neither one of these things happened. Small portions, probably a store bought sweet and sour sauce. I was shocked when I saw this. The carne adovada that everyone seems to rave about, was not the business. Pretty bland and the beans and rice that they were served with needed some help. I will say that at least the carne adovada was a very big portions and the tortilla that it was served with was good. Same story with the enchiladas. The sauce tasted either burnt or the chilis that they used were way too smokey. Disappointing to say the least. Felt pretty ripped off when we left this place. Crazy and unnecessary prices to match unimpressive food. Not what I'm looking for when going out for a meal.",

Green chili linguine, grilled chicken and chipotle cream sauce. So delicious back in the day the generous portion was served over a tortilla with melted cheese so kind of gave it a nice bottom crust, today was two folded tortillas on the side like a fajita, not a fan but still fantastic and rich as an understatement. Spicy and an amazing zing to it and all pasta comes with a house salad delicious but basic, lettuce, cheese, red peppers in lieu of tomatoes with ranch dressing. The pasta and salad at least for me is two meals! Decadent but delicious!",

First of all, like everyone says this place is a True hideaway, there are no signs.  It is very small with only a couple tables, with dim lighting and rich wood as the decor.  Second, it is a delicious New Mexican/Tex Mex place.  As soon as you walk in the door, you smell the smoker and all the delicious flavors.  Our waiter was awesome, gave us very helpful tips on the menu and portion size.  The meals are very large, extremely hot and impossible to go finish unless you come on a very empty stomach.  My friend and I both tried the Carne Adovada, which isn't your typical Mexican but it sure was yummy.  The pork is so soft and it is marinated for hours in a rich chili sauce, you can really taste the smoker - it is so overpowering! Let me just say, the beans served with the carne were some of the best beans ever.    This is by far some of the best southwestern cuisine I have ever eaten!  Next time, I would really like to try some other dishes!!",

    "text": "Dick's Hideaway is one of my favorite spots in the city so naturally for my 21st birthday I decided to visit and have my first drink there (along with some bomb breakfast). Like always the food was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect, unfortunately our waiter was far far below average. When taking our orders he was quite rude, telling me one thing then contradicting it completely in his next sentence. Then that was all we really saw of him. Not once did he ask if our meal was good or if we needed anything (we needed more water), although we saw him multiple times helping guests around us. For some reason he just did not want to help us and ignored us. I had to ask someone else to get my food boxed up to take home. When he gave us our check he did not say anything to us, just set it on the table. When he took our check, again he did not say anything or even make eye contact with us. He somewhat redeemed himself by saying happy birthday as we walked out but it does not make up for an entire meal ignored. I did not use his name for privacy but if someone from the restaurant wanted to reach out I will gladly share his name. And again, I seriously love this place. Just this one guy really ruined the entire experience this time. Maybe he was having a bad day, I'm not sure. Hope he gets help if so! Also I got an Irish Coffee and it was good! I think it was good, I don't have anything to compare it to as it was my first drink but I enjoyed it.",

It's really dim on the inside.  The epitome of Southwestern style.  If you walk in and go to the area on the right, there is a huge table that can fit about 10 people, so you would probably be sitting with some strangers.  I don't mind because I like meeting new people.    Anyways, the plates are not shareable (it says so on the menu that sharing is not allowed), which I don't understand because their plates are huge!  I don't like wasting food.  Also, I had the carne adovada, and it wasn't that awesome.  The portion was huge, the meat was too salty.  I wasn't a fan.    The place just has a nice ambiance to it.   The food, not so much.",

    "text": "We had a few hours for dinner in Phoenix on a Friday night before our flight home and after searching for authentic Mexican food online, I found Dick's Hideaway featured on a tourism site under the recommendation of a local chef the site interviewed for suggestions. Turns out the research was very important because I saw pictures of what the unlabeled entrance looked like and thus had an easy time finding it. However, there is no hostess so seat yourself. The various waiters seemed rushed but whenever they stopped by were very friendly. The place was pretty full around 5:30 PM, surprisingly, but emptied out afterwards, so there was plenty of bar seating. Ambience is low-key with slight upscale flair, so not the most authentic. There is more parking in the back of the strip of stores if the front is full.  I had to try the Carne Adovada based on reviews and this was the best pulled pork I have had in my life - that defines the 5-stars in my review. It is defined by its smoky flavor and tender texture. The sides it came with--warm flour tortilla, rice, and pinto beans--were also extremely flavorful. Portion was huge so I had to share with my partner, and even then with one entree each, we could not finish the food. Ceviche appetizer was only 3-stars, and my partner's Grilled shrimp wrapped in bacon was also stellar, though can't compare with the Carne Adovada dish. Their red ale was smooth and not too heavy. Would highly recommend this hidden spot!",

Well Hidden is correct, after a frustrating drive around the shopping center and a couple direct phone calls asking for the location, we found the spot. We had to walk thru what seems to just be a dish washing pit or a normal restaurants kitchen.   The place was so small, I thought if more then three people stood in the room, the place would be full. EXTREMELY CLAUSTROPHOBIC in this tiny one room bar.  The server that first approached our table was an older gentlemen who didn't seem to want to be there today, I don't blame him I wouldn't want to be there either.  after he was gone for what seem like an hour but was in reality only 23 mins, a new server came by to take our order.   The food was sub par if that. A too hot to touch (which shouldn't be put in front of a human without proper oven mitts) metal plate gets put in front of me with a unimaginative plop of red in covered by two eggs is set in front of me. I know most Mexican food looks like slop, but I did expect a higher level then this.   Sadly after a very long frustrating tour of the back of the shopping center it is located in, service with a grimace, and some food a pet roach would be happy to receive, we sadly turned our heels and left.   Utter waste of a perfect brunch day, at least they had some funny signs.",

Others had the smoke pork chop which looked good but I heard them complain it was tough. The service was great for the large crowd. The private room wee were in was a let down.

It's the food of Richardson's within a speakeasy atmosphere. Quirky rustic  ambiance served with a meaty, habanero kick. Great for an adventurous early date where you want to see if the other person \"gets it\", and to \"get some\" later if they do get it. And of course, an old reliable that you suddenly perk up and remember when you think you've run out of options for a great casual meal.  Also, the private room/wine cellar is a great option for smallish family gatherings, company events and holiday parties. The reservation fee completely applies to the tab and the enivronment itself keeps the conversation moving.  Don't ever change Dick's! (does that need a comma somewhere?)",

There aren't many better first date locales.  The Pork Chop Chorizo, Roasted Garlic Plate, Red White and Blue Enchiladas, and of course the Carne Adovada are some of the real standouts for me.

We were tired of the same old places near us, so I finally remembered about Dick's Hideaway.  The other couple had never been there. My husband and myself had been there about 4 times before, but not in a long while.   We had always eaten at a table in the bar area, which is so cozy! But, we actually were sat in the private dining room, which we had only been able to peek into before. It was really a treat!    we started with the roasted garlic platter, which we have ordered as an appetizer every time we have been there. It is quite a lot of food for 4 as a starter. It is amazing!! You know that you are going to pay for it  the next day, but we just can't resist!   There were 12 specials that night. three of us decided on a special for our dinners. My girlfriend & I had the fresh sea bass.  First we got a salad included, which was very good, with a house dressing. The portion of fish was very large, and so amazingly delicious. My friend said it was some of the best she has ever had, and I have to agree. The plate is filled to the brim with a medley of fresh vegetables and their special green chili pepper mashed potatoes. My husband had the mixed grill special, which included medallions of pork tenderloin, filet mignon and a couple of lamb chops. The meats were perfect! My girlfriend's husband had the surf and turf from the regular menu, and I figure he liked his as well, since the plate was clean!!     I am always a bit nervous recommending to eat out somewhere that is a bit on the pricey side, but they can't wait to go back! Neither can I !!",

The small space (3-4 tables and 7-8 bar seats) and aesthetic of the room screamed \"my kind of place!\" We grabbed seats at the bar (the only open seats at the room) and immediately ordered a couple beers. Bueno.  The food, however, was no bueno. The chips and guac were disappointing (never a good sign). Chips need to be thick to stand up to guacamole's weight. These were thin and brittle. The guac had a pretty middle of the road flavor - nothing to write home about. My entree was the pork enchiladas and they were just a goopy, greasy mess. The meat tasted pretty fatty and didn't have any real flavor to offer besides oily. The 1:1 ratio with the super oily cheese wasn't helping any. My dad had some kind of fish dish which inspired the dreaded \"This tastes weird. Here, taste this. Does it taste weird to you?\" exchange. My brother reports that his skewers were also pretty blah.  Maybe we caught them on an off night?",

I asked or no beans, but I got em anyway, which actually turned out fine because I liked their beans (i usually am not a fan). My dad got the blue, white, and yellow (?) corn enchiladas. His was actually better than mine in my opinion. However, I thought the best item was the tamale... i think it had pork in it, not sure, but it was quite tasty. The relleno wasn't anything special and I actually really did not like the chicken burro... so much so that I only had a few bites of it. The chicken tasted weird... like maybe it was boiled in dirty water or something... not good. at all. So overall it wasn't bad, but I wouldn't want to pay 15$ when 2/3s of the food was meh or less. If I did go back, I think I would stick with the pork, that seemed to be the winning meat at this restaurant... and really, when isn't it?",

Is there any food substance in the state of Arizona that's tastier than the chorizo used to make the breakfast quesadillas here? Maybe a slice of Bianco's Wiseguy pizza. That's about it. As I sat here yesterday for brunch, I remarked to a friend that I couldn't wait until our next brunch here to have that quesadilla again, before the one on my plate was even finished. She felt exactly the same way.   Did I mention the breakfast happy hour special of $5 bloody marys and mimosas? The bloody's come with a free shot of beer.   Best breakfast spot in town, hands down.",

The interior is funky, dark, and small (cool copper counter tops) but that just adds to the character.  I ordered pork enchiladas(?) and shared the sauteed garlic dish (i think that's what it was)?  It was very yummy and left me wanting more.  The only downfall was that the garlic must have gotten into my pores b/c I felt like I smelled of garlic for days!  It was well worth it though and a spot you should certainly check out.",

Sitting at the bar, watching your food being cooked right in front of you.   The rack of lamb is sublime. The \"Taos Combo\" or anything on the special board, especially seafood, is always incredible. Their margaritas, cocktails, wine - all great. Bacon wrapped shrimp ftw. They come on a plate with a tortilla on the bottom, rice, beans, and sauce on top, and the bacon wrapped shrimp on top of that. The salad, which comes with many entrees, is awesome. And don't forget the flan, topped with prickly pear syrup. You can't go wrong.   It's a testament to how good this place is that they don't need a sign.",

The exterior doesn't even have a sign! Very dimly lit, so at first, I was hesitant. Tiny, tiny eatery. maybe 3 tables, and seating along there bar (we sat at the bar). It was in the middle of a downpour, so our wait was no more than 5 minutes, but every table was full. I can imagine on a regular weekend, the line is probably out the door...the breakfast was fresh, made right in front of you, and I watched as they sprinkled fresh blueberries on my pancakes. Soooo good. The coffee was great and the bacon was out of this world.  My husband has the carne adovada which he LOVED. Charming and eclectic-definitely going back.",

It was really busy during Sunday brunch time, the slender bar/restaurant area was packed and I noticed a few customers leave after seeing how packed it was. Our large group reserved the banquet room which is surrounded by racks upon racks of wine and is centered around a unique copper-like dining table.   I ordered one of the enchilada dishes, and asked to have one of them with their red chile and the other with green chile sauce. If you get the enchiladas, I only suggest the green chile, though. Atop them laid an over-easy egg, also served with pinto beans and a cubed potatoe mixture that was quite tasty. This dish was amazing! One of their most popular brunch dishes is the Carne Adovada Burrito, which I constantly hear rave reviews on (come on an empty stomach- its BIG!).  Certainly coming back to try their Bloody Mary's and lunch menu :)",

Well, we got em and shot em. She did too. Already, this place was up there on my list.  I had the mushroom tamale dinner and it was so good. The rice and beans are perfect, not over cooked like some are. The food was screaming hot when it was dropped which was a good sign it was right off the grill. The open kitchen area made you feel like a part of the restaurant, like you were there cooking right along beside the chefs. The bar has a ton to select from and the cooks are happy to chat with you and hang with you while they're making whatever delicious delight you ordered. Great experience, great company, great food.",

The portions and quality of food and presentation has changed within the last five or six months.    I think it is because they got rid of a lot of the old staff that made that place so awesome.  It was like Cheers, they knew us by name and if not by name at least by face and that is how we were treated...with a smile, great service, and great food.  We are still big fans of Rokerij (which is owned by the same folks as Dick's and Richardsons).  I'd really like to see this place turn back around.

I found Dick's on Yelp, and hastily made a quick decision to have my fellow out of townees join me for dinner when they picked me up at the airport.  Unsure of what we were in for, I kept my fingers crossed as we pulled up to the strip mall keeping our eyes peeled for this hidden treasure.  We just about gave up after circling the strip a few times... until we found the door marked 6008.  Thank goodness we found it!  We luckily got a table right away just as another party was leaving.  One of the guys reassured us of our choice.  He told us we'd love it, and that he comes here everytime he's in town.  The staff was super friendly, super helpful and super nice--always making sure we had everything we needed and that our margaritas were full.  YOU MUST GET THE MARGARITA!  One of the best I've had, probably because of the fresh squeezed lime juice that you can really taste.  The chips and salsa + guacamole is a must.  So fresh.  I could have eaten just this and would have been satisfied.  The recommended skewers appetizer was just as tasty as the bartender said it would be.  Between the three of us, we could have had just these two items and would have been fine, but we each ordered an enchilada entree that definitely put us over the top.  I got both the red and green sauce, but I would recommend just the green.  If we had more time on our trip, we would have come back for a second visit.  We'll definitely be back on our next trip!",

Delicious.  Nice heat.   The order of potatoes and beans rounds out this plate.  The Bar tending staff is friendly, professional and cater's to the customers' needs.  Why not?  This place is about the size of my living room...quaint and perfect for hosting any friend with a hangover.  The ambiance is perfect for the perfect bloody mary.  If you can handle the breakfast menu, don't be ashame not to clean your plate.  Dessert is always something to look forward to after a tasty meal.  If chocolate is your thing (it's not mine), try whatever is on the blackboard.  The chocolate brownie a la mode was on the menu...and it was delicious.

The place wasn't terribly crowded when my girlfriend and I arrived, and we had the option of sitting either at the bar or at one of the small tables (we sat at a table).  The two guys who seemed to be running the place were both very nice and friendly.    I ordered the chicken enchiladas and eggs and my girlfriend ordered the turkey rellenos and eggs.  I absolutely loved my dish and thought it was a great value for the price ($12).  I was less enthusiastic about the rellenos, but that is because I'm just not a fan of rellenos generally.  I would generally describe our meals as \"brunch with a kick,\" which is exactly what we were looking for.    The only reason that I might be reluctant to come here again is that I am new to the area and I just like to try different places for the sake of trying different places.  Also, it's about a 20 minute drive from Tempe;  as someone previously living in  DC, i am more used to walking to the places i want to eat.  But if i lived nearby i would probably go every week.",

Hello Yelp, are you asleep at the switch on this? It's New Mexican, get it right. Calling it Tex-Mex is totally insulting to people from New Mexico. It would be like saying that Japanese and Chinese food is the same because they both use a lot of rice.",

I had a lovely Perrier with lime and ice to start - and ordered the Red River Chile sopa.  Let me just say if you don't enjoy spicy, don't bother with this soup.  It contained, beef, red chile, cheese and beans (dollop of salsa fresca).  Very rich flavor from the red chile and a nice kick.  Next, I had the chicken quesadillas - cheesy, crispy and enjoyable.  It came along with a red salsa and a green tomatillo-based salsa.  Great flavors and very fresh food along with a warm, cozy atmosphere.  I will definitely be back!",

We've eaten here several times but have yet to have a bad meal.   Everything is fabulous, it's close to home and it's kind of like our little secret. In fact, I'm kind of scared to write this review because I'm afraid that everybody and his/her dog is gonna want to come here and then I'll NEVER get a table! [not that we've ever gotten one of the three tables, we've always settled for the eat-on bar.]  It's run by the same nice folks who own Richardson's around the corner, so you know you'll always get a great meal.   And if your party runs more than three, you can always reserve the party room next door--it's actually the wine room with a big copper-topped table and lots and lots of ambience.  Let's just put it this way--it's way different than anything else in town, and that's a good thing.",

Here is what you get: smoked pork roast simmered in red chile, rice, beans, cheese & a flour tortilla. Okay, sounds like you have seen this before right? Not so fast- just look at this photo! Is your mouth watering yet?  Did I tell you Dick's Hideaway had me at GARLIC?!

    "text": "Yeah gluten free options!  Excellent food!  Husband had Chimayo chicken that has a red spicier sauce and subbed out asparagus for the potatoes.  He said it's delicious.  Our waitress (Rachel?) was very kind and helpful making modifications to my meal around my food allergy restrictions.  I had 1 smoked turkey enchilada (my favorite) and 1 veggie (very tasty) and had my green sauce on the side as it's very zippy during the summer with New Mexico chilies (their heat varies by season, if I recall correctly hot dry summer makes the peppers hotter).  I also substituted egg whites.  We were checked on no less than 6x which was refreshing and everyone was so nice!  Excellent New Mexico sauces, comparable to what I had in Santa Fe (now I don't have to travel so far lol).  I like sauces!  Christmas sauce is half red and half green but thought it'd be too much for me.  Still we both had that runny nose after eating, my understanding is they can make it as hot as you'd like.  I thought I was looking for a blue door from a photo posted somewhere online. It's not blue but brown wooden slats.  They don't have a big sign, definitely a hidden gem.  Located in same plaza as Luci's Healthy Food (I think South facing) but I think it's East facing.  Easier to park in the back as people park part on the pavement and park on sidewalk not in parking spaces potentially blocking you in.    Fun ambiance southwestern style, copper booth tables, pub style, and cool/dark for those hot days.  The copper table room is pub style sharing tables which was fun because the Soccer Tournament was on, so a lot of chatting amongst the area.  It looked to met like larger dining area to the side for events and dinner.  The bar tables were full when we arrived at 11, so that says something about the delicious food!  I imagine they get really full in the evenings but well worth the effort.",

We split the skewer plate as an appetizer which was delicious. I had the carne adovada with eggs and my husband had the duck rellanos. Both dishes didn't disappoint and came with plenty of heat.  Dicks will be our new go to brunch spot.",

    "text": "Like the name suggests this place is a bit hidden. In fact there is no sign other than the 2 bushes I front of the door.  It is next to a natural food store named luci's and well worth hunting for.   Inside the restaurant is a hybrid bar/romantic get a way with a dark atmosphere filled with the smoke from the stove and hardwood tables. Yes it is a place for a date but also it's a place to go get a few drinks (8 am this morning and no less than 4 people were drinking wine at the bar)  As for the food, it's delicious. Heavily spiced though it might be, the food has a Mexican/New Mexican taste to it and the portions are huge. Of special note is the heavenly fresh squeezed OJ (like eating a super sweet orange without the chewing)  If you are looking for a great meal this is your spot, breakfast lunch or dinner.",

I'd suggest sharing, it was so tasty and yummy. Once you walk in you feel like you've just walked into a vampire dungeon haha I love the darkness so it was a cool experience. If you're in the area, definitely give it a try. I don't even remember what I ordered but my friend got the burrito and it was on point.",

    "text": "Holy shit... Thank you fellow yelpers for turning my head towards this place because honestly if I didn't find this place and tried out their food I would have been very disappointed. Reading other reviews, I found that this place was indeed a hideaway. This place has literally no sign and you basically have to walk by the door to know that it was there. Luckily, I found it with little to no problem. When walking in we just sat at the table that was closest to the door and got our happy hour drink as well as got our orders in.   Almost immediately I was eyeing the Pork Chop Chorizo. Pork Chops stuffed with chorizo?! Come on, this was one of the easiest ones to pick out. My friend was jealous that I was having tamales so for sure I picked an order of their special tamales to go along with my meal as an appetizer. Honestly, I was still sort of full from lunch, but I wasn't going to say no to dinner.   So for appetizers, I ordered the pork tamale, that was really tasty mixed with the green and red chile it just brings it over the top. For the entree, as said before I picked what I was eyeing. The Pork Chop Chorizo. Oh yeah, I thought it was stuffed pork chop with the chorizo inside and what came out was a complete surprise to me. They gave me two pork chops stacked and then the chorizo was sandwiched in between. The pork chop was flavored well too! It had a simple sweet glaze on top and then it was served on top of a green and red chile which then gave the overall dish a slow heat.   Overall, this place is a definite place to visit just for the ambiance, the decor, and the pork chops that I had. The tamale was simple, but the chile and how they prepared it gave that flavor and gave me an idea of how green chile should be prepared. Definitely recommend to check this place out and give a try if you're in looking for neat spots.",

First, there is no sign.  When you arrive, call so they can tell you which door is Dick's.  Be prepared when you enter, because it's pretty dark and takes a minute to adjust to the dark.  Next pay attention to the server's recommendations, because they know their food.  I had the Richardsons Combo, which was my best restaurant meal of the year.  I love to cook and eat out when I'm on the road (I travel a fair amount) so I have an appreciation of good food.  The jalapeno hollandaise benedict was flavorful with a thick \"smoked\" canadian bacon.  It was so thick, I could hardly bite it with my teeth (what a treat!).  The asparagus was perfectly steamed and provided a perfect compliment to the benedict.  As good as the benedict and asparagus, I was amazed that the enchiladas with a mix of red and green sauce were even better.  It was so good I ate ever bite.  I tried to go back for another meal, but my schedule didn't permit.  Don't skip this place for a great meal.",

Personally, I have never eaten at a restaurant that I have told others about more than Dick's. If I lived in Phoenix, however, I would tell no one because I wouldn't want the competition for a seat! So, whether you prefer red or green chili, slow roasted chicken, or carnitas adovada (this is killer); I promise you that you'll crow about the experience.  Just in case you'd like something else, try Richardson's.  It is close by, larger, and owned by the same family. ENJOY!!  (Green chili eggs Benedict pictured)",

Didn't take long to get seated. They have a number of larger tables that you'll be seated next to other diners, but not a big deal for us and we sat at those both times.  Your placemats act as your menu with a few specials on blackboards spaced in different parts of the restaurant. First thing I'll mention is it is pricier than I typically spend on brunch, but the portions are generous and the food is well done. I've gotten both the carne adovada + eggs as well as a tamale breakfast special, both of which they managed to get some great flavor out of the adovada preparation and came with some great sides. Nothing particularly special about the cocktails one way or the other.  Haven't been for dinner but it seems even more overpriced.   Service was so-so. First visit was standard, but second visit they never checked in with us even when our drinks were empty (loss for them - we'd have ordered a second set) and my wife actually got the wrong benedict. She didn't initially notice/comment until I asked where her sauce was (she had ordered the carne adovada one, got some kind of ham benedict), and didn't get an opportunity to mention it until after she'd already eaten half the plate (again - the server never checked in). The server did give us a half plate of the correct one to take home, but did give us a bit of an accusatory attitude when we mentioned it.  Regardless, it's certainly worth a try.",

The atmosphere was fantastic, and exactly what I like...but oh my did Richardson's do one hell of a job in the kitchen. I really didn't even know just how much I adored New Mexican style food until I ate here.   I went here for breakfast and got the carne adovada and my girlfriend went with the chile rellenos. The adovada was through the roof delicious! Smokey, spicy, salty and prefectly tender! It was some of the best adovada that I've experienced, period. Fast forward to me getting around to trying the rellenos and you would have seen me with my lower jaw hitting the table (after chewing and swallowing of course). They were incredible; like, seriously incredible! My girlfriend won the battle of, \"Whose cuisine will reign supreme?\" hands down! I must eat those again! The last part of the meal that I feel needs recognition is the grapefruit juice. Sounds silly, but it was also amazing. It was so fresh that I'm surprised I didn't find some of the peel in it!  Dick's Hideaway is a must try! Richardson'st impressed the hell out of me, and I can't wait to go and eat more of their delicious food!",

You have to know where to go since there is no outside sign. Once you are in, it is probably unlike any restaurant you've been to - feels much more like a dive bar (in a good way!). I always choose to sit along the bar so I can watch the food being prepared. The dishes are huge and packed with flavor. If you haven't been before, definitely make sure to try it. And if you have an out of town guest, this is the perfect place to bring them.",

Sure, if it's packed you can just get in your car and drive a couple miles north to Rokery J or Richardsons and i highly suggest you do so i can get a seat faster.  I really love the food and the people that work here top off the experience.  Sitting there today and watching the chef prepare meals was like watching a great musician play his or her instrument.  It was so fun to watch in fact that i was moved to write this long overdue review.  Thank you Dick's hideaway.  If you weren't here i don't know what i would do.",

    "text": "Hoo-boy, did I feel like an idiot.  I've been wanting to try Dick's Hideaway for some time now, being a lover of New Mexican cuisine.  My main stumbling block was not knowing where the hell it is.  After circling the intersection several times and cursing my GPS I finally decided to park and wander around.  It's a good thing I did!  After walking past the unassuming doors a few times (hence the idiot feelings) I finally saw the tiny menu stuck next to the storefront.  I cautiously went in.  The interior is small to the extreme, but very cozy and well appointed.  The bar area was completely full so I stood by the door in the hopes of finding a hostess or server.  Ten minutes passed and again I felt like an idiot.  Finally a kind server took pity on me and seated me at the public table.  From here on out everything went smooth as butter.  The menu was full of enticing food.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Christmas style (red and green sauce).  The food was delivered quickly, and it was amazing.  The eggs were cooked to perfection and the beans were well flavored.  I didn't intend on eating the seasoned red potatoes, really I didn't.  They were so perfectly cooked that I couldn't resist.  The red and green sauces were exactly what I was craving, perfectly spiced.  Maybe there's a trick to Dick's Hideaway, a perfect time to come or a way to sneak a seat at the bar.  If I can solve the riddle you can bet I'll be back again and again.",

It's very easy to pass up if you don't know it's there (which is right next to Luci's Market).    The food at Dick's is so deliciously good!  But if definitely has kick, so if you don't like spicy foods, you might want to mention it to them.  The rice and beans alone, which are just sides to the main dish, are incredibly good.  And the enchiladas were perfectly cooked (other than maybe a little heavy handed on the cheese).  I definitely want to go back and try different items on the menu.  The staff is also very welcoming and warm, which is always appreciated.",

Only because it is such a small restaurant and most of the time the back room is being rented out by private parties. Also definitely not a kid friendly place which is a total bummer for us because we have a newborn and no babysitter to leave our little one behind with which means no more dicks hideaway :(...however this will be our first stop when we get a night out.",

It's cozy; it's little more than a long bar, a kitchen and a few tables. However, this small restaurant delivered some big flavors. I had a burrito dish that the bartender said was the place's signature dish. The pulled pork inside the burrito was delicious, and it was topped with cheese and a bold, spicy red pepper sauce.  There are no frills here. The sole TV was small and playing a Spanish soccer match when I went. With a lack of distraction and close quarters, you'd better have a good conversationalist when you go.",

As you turn to the right you realize there is a dining room with a few tables, with a big community table in the middle. That's where we sat. The menus are the placemats which is convenient. I got the New Mexico Enchiladas. 3 of your choice so I did cheese, pork and shrimp. You also get a choice of green or red sauce.  The food comes pretty quickly and its piping hot.  All 3 enchiladas were very good. Gooey and cheesey and spicy, and I got the green sauce.  There's a warning on their menu, basically you order it you own it so be careful of the sauce you choose. The rice was plump and delicious and the tortilla was fresh. The portion was good sized and I could only eat half.  The place has personality. Almost looks like it used to be a residence of some sort but I'm not sure how that could be in a strip mall. Has a fireplace and a bathroom with a shower!  I'd definitely come back.",

You don't mind sitting in a small crowded area on torn stools and quite possibly waiting in line for it (it's open seating and pretty much no reservations).  To be fair, you might find a place in the dining area up the steps, but it only has one very large table and two or three small ones.  The bar area also seats about 20 to 25.  At Sunday brunch it was very crowded. 2.  You aren't really concerned about erratic service so long as it is polite. 3.  You like very spicy food.  I personally like some spice in my food (I order medium heat when given a choice) but this goes way beyond that.  I also like spicy-flavorful, but this was spicy-overwhelm the flavor. 4.  You are not value concious, because prices are a bit steep here.  Obviously I will not be back so why do I think you might enjoy it?  Well, it's different -   A.  The food gets high marks for creativity and you might enjoy it if you can take the heat. B.  It's clean -- a hole-in-the-wall but a clean one.  You might enjoy the \"quirky\" ambiance.",

Simply charming, and felt so intimate I could of relaxed here all night. With that being said, Dick's Hideaway is a very small establishment, seating is limited, but so worth the tight squeeze and wait. The \"GCP\" is to die for. I could of just ordered a dozen of them and sat on my couch all night. Their dinner salad is shockingly good. The dressing was pure heaven. I look forward to trying their other restaurants in the neighborhood and have high hopes they will be as equally amazing.",

The lighting is dim, so if you struggle to see in dimmed lighting, use your phone to help read the menu. I saw another couple do that but I felt the lighting was just enough. Also don't expect overly friendly staff; not a knock or suggesting anyone was rude. My fiance and I both felt our server was just about doing the job sans any effort on rapport or charisma. Better than lousy service or slow service granted, but it'd be nice to feel like he was into having us as guests.",

Seriously, I could have made this two meals, but I didn't.  I was so stuffed.  The service was also good.  Our waiter was able to help us make good choices since it was our first visit.

Both plates were great, but the carne adovada takes the trophy for the best meal during our four-day getaway. I had no idea what adovada was until I ate it here. It's definitely spicy, but coming from someone who orders everything mild, I'd still order this plate and not request it mild (not sure if that's an option) in fear that the flavors may change. Not sure when we'll make it back to Phoenix, but whenever that is, I know I'll be eating adovada from here again.",

Its clearly a local watering hole and it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. The atmosphere is intimate, warm, with a south western flare. Half the kitchen is exposed to whoever sits at the bar, so its coll watching them make meals. They have an OK selection of beers on draft, but they certainly lean more towards the wine department.   For their happy hour menu, they shorten some entrees to a more tapas style plate. I really enjoyed this option, since I could taste a little of everything.   Duck Rellenos were quite interesting. Piping hot, just the right amount of spice, the gaminess and smoke of the duck gives it a robust feel, and the cheese blends everything together.   Carne Adovada Sliders were delicious. Good size, good bread, and tasty meat. The southwest flavors in the meat really bloom here.   Grilled Shrimp were actually worth getting here. Its pricey, but if that doesnt bother you, then go for it. The sauces surrounding the shrimp almost didnt seem like the designated dipping sauces. The cheesy sauce was my favorite. The rice and beans were ok, but nothing to pig out on.",

It is a darkish three room place with great music from the bar area and muted TVs showing sports throughout. Seating is community table style. It had a great vibe and menu.   The dishes featuring chilis are truthfully advertised as \"smothered\" in chili sauce. I dug out my huevos rancheros, but when I return, will ask for the chili sauce on the side so I can control the volume.   Coffee from ROC2 was out of this world. While the restaurant has their own blend, I recommend going out to Cave Creek to tour the roastery and pick up coffee. Unfortunately it is not open on Sundays and the Whole Foods we visited was sold out so I will have to order from the website.",

Friendly young waitress ask if I  wanted to do a communal table or the bar so I decided to get a bar seat so I could watch what I later learned was the whole kitchen .  Watching these guys work and put out the dishes and amount of food was impressive , the service was friendly and great .: I settled on the carne adovada with eggs and hash browns which comes with beans and tortillas .. numerous pictures on yelp. It was very good not the best I have had but solid and a large portion ..  a funky experience , good food , great service , and large portions price a little high ($21) but portion enough for two.

Very low key, chill, quiet, and overall very nice. I heard they have great bunch specials too.  The food was tasty and decent selection.  Service was on par. Seating was comfortable and presentation was on point.  Overall pretty neat place that I would recommend. I want to go another couple times so I can see if I would go 1  up or down.",

    "text": "We had been wanting to check out Dick's for a long time. The atmosphere seemed unique, and I love New Mexican style food. Our experience at Dick's was OK, but we probably won't go back anytime soon.  The Carne Adovada was pretty good, though I'm not one for large portion sizes. The portions at Dick's are LARGE. Great if that's your thing, but its not mine.   Besides the food, we weren't really impressed with the service. We were sitting at the bar, and there were plenty of bar tenders/servers walking past us the whole time, so it was surprising that the service was so slow. After we finished eating, we sat for 20 minutes waiting for someone to run our check. I'm sure this isn't everyone's experience, but we were rather annoyed by the time we left.  If the food or service had been amazing, I would have given Dick's another star, but we left feeling kind of, meh.",

I had the enchiladas and the portions were sized so I had enough left over for the next day's feast. The green and red chile were killer. They have a short but excellent(i recommend the Modern Times IPA that was available that day)beer list. The wines were reasonably priced and the list was large enough to satisfy every palate. For dinner, we had the New Mexican Enchilada plate, the Chicken Solano, two Grey Gooses on the Rocks and Two Modern Times IPA, and with the tip the meal came to 88.00 dinero. To emphasize again this was no doubt one of the best meals I have had since moving to Phoenix this summer. Funky neighborhood too.",

    "text": "I can not emphasize enough just how kick-ass this hidden gem really is.  First off, this joint isn't called Dick's Hideaway for no reason. Upon arrival you learn rather quickly how the name and location tie in together so effortlessly. And if you've found yourself here, you've already won half the battle.   Secondly, you've got to be okay with ignoring the menu and your instincts by trying their Carne Adovada Benedict. I say ignore because not everyone is a fan of spiciness (which this place is infamous for) or dabbling with unfamiliarity. But I am not even kidding, you can NOT go to this place and disregard the plate that their most known for.  Now I can be quite the weenie when it comes to spicy foods but this particular skillet had me craving it twice in one weekend. In fact, I seriously contemplated on whether or not I should miss my early flight back home (The Bay Area) just to have one more plate. Needless to say, I chose wrong and have been regretting it everyday since.  Don't be a prick and go to Dick's!",

We had a good time and we're chatting with some other people we met. But once the server noticed we were just chatting and taking up space he let us know that we should leave since there were others waiting outside to get in. I get it but damn we just spent quite a bit of money there and I guess it was just the way he said it. Basically it was a huge turn off. We felt like we literally got kicked out. So yeah.

    "text": "This review will reveal itself in...  5....  4....  3...  2...  1...  Consider finding this review the equivalent of finding the front door to Dick's Hideaway. This restaurant definitely lives up to its name. Everything about it is hidden! The front door? Don't look for a sign. The True regulars know what door leads them to Dick's. The back entrance? Don't expect direction. Those who need to know where the back entrance do, and those who don't will walk around aimlessly until they find the front door. How about the bathroom lock? Don't worry, you won't have to go with an unlocked door, but it will take you time to find it...hint: it looks like a metal rod that's a part of the door.   One thing Dick's doesn't hide from you is the quality of their food. Completely delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. The enchiladas melt in your mouth, the chips and guac are good (ask for the flour chips-- thanks Aileen!) I went for the New Mexico Platter and all I can say is how! I was given a rellenao, chicken burro and tamale to try. Yes, it all kind of blended together but only because every bite was just as delicious as the next. It's spicy, it's cheesy, it's creamy, it's sassy (yes, I said sassy!)...it's just delicious. I tried my hardest to finish the meal but I only got maybe half way through (maybe less). It's a LOT of food and you could easily share.   Now be warned before you visit, this is a hideaway and that means, it's not big. Originally, there used to be maybe room for 15 people total. But now they have a room that fits about 30 more and it's perfect for a large group, but be sure to make a reservation!",

My buddy ordered the breakfast burrito and I ordered Huevos Rancheros.  We sat at the bar and the cook was phenomenal to watch, my mouth was watering when I saw the green chili sauce poured on my eggs.  The beans, the potatoes and my eggs were cooked perfectly, the flavor of the green chili had just the perfect kick too.  I had a taste of the breakfast burrito and it was full of the best flavor.  Even my cup of coffee was tasty...which I don't expect anymore, so it was a great surprise and start to the day.    Atmosphere: quaint and inviting, and very clean Chef: Entertaining and spot on with everything, couldn't wait to get my plate Server: A little slow, but she seemed super busy, didn't see anyone helping her Food: A++ for Flavor, presentation, and texture!! I can't wait to go back!!!",

WHY GO THERE? My friend's exact words were: \"I'm about to change your life. Tomorrow go to Dick's Hideaway on 16th and Bethany Home. And it doesn't stand for what you think it does. There's no sign so look up the address. Be prepared to wait or eat at the bar. No bullshit the best breakfast place if not restaurant in the world.\"  He wasn't  kidding when he said no business sign out the building. We almost missed the place, but it's worth the second drive around the block.  WHATCHAGOT? I got the Tenderloin Benedict, which is not cheap for a breakfast entree, but all worth it. My companion had the Huevos Rancheros. I love protein in my breakfast. Remember when they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day? At Dick's Hideaway, it's the truth!  YOU GOT SERVED. Service is quick and friendly. Water is brought out as soon as you're seated. The food is hot, and so is the metal plate it's on.   I'm glad to find this hidden gem. Dick, whoever you are, you can come out of hiding.",

My meatloaf was so badly burnt it had a crust that could not be bitten through. We spotted a waiter and told him it was burnt and then turned over the meatloaf and it was solid black thick crust. The server shrugged and took the plate. On the way out he asked if I wanted anything else I said no. Our main server then avoided our table like the black plague had been seated with us. When the bill came she dropped off the tab and quickly scooted out to the back of the house. No apology, no comment she just tossed it on the table and left. We paid and left. While in the car on the way home we rode in silence, totally speechless at what a poor job they did of handling this situation. 25 years in the service industry and I have never seen a situation that was so poorly handled. After swearing off RIchardson's for over a year due to a horrible experience there we are now adding this one to the black list of places we will not return to under any circumstance.",

    "text": "I've now tried this place several times.    I want to like it, and I rarely write bad reviews, but, UGH!   The cost versus what you get is so out of whack that I'm compelled to write.     The food is very HEAVY/greasy, it's expensive ($100.00 for 3 people) for what you get, and the preparation is poor at best.   My friends had the steak and the carne adobada, I the rellenos.   We had the garlic dish, which sadly didn't come before the meal but, rather with it.    But, even that is that wasn't a big deal.     However, sadly, all of us pretty much confirmed that the meals, had we made them at home, we would have tossed and taken the family out.   People seem to want to compare this place with Richardson's due to similar DNA, unfortunately the place is not anywhere near as good as Richardson's was and I can't really put a finger on why.  If you like heavy, greasy, premium priced food, then this place is for you.",

    "text": "My favorite food in the world is New Mexican, which is not to be confused with any other variation of Mexican.  NewMex is unique and in my humble opinion, is much more sophisticated than its spurious cousins.  I used to live in northern New Mexico and I got hooked to it the first day I lived there.  It is one of my life quests (this sounds awful, right?) to find the best New Mexican places to eat in the US.  Meal:  I went with the green chile meatloaf with medium eggs.  I also went with the beans and the potatoes.  To drink,  I went with two different beers, but I can't remember which ones.  Taste:  Holy shit! The meatloaf was the best meatloaf I have ever had.  The eggs were complimented the meal extremely well and the green chile is spicy.  But it wasn't that it was just \"hot\" but it had great seasonings.  The only let down was the tortilla.  It wasn't homemade fresh.  Had it been served with my meal, this place would be a perfect 10.  8 out of 10.  Value:  Outside of saying its above average but not great, I don't know what else to really say.  The portions are healthy size and you will be bound to have a little leftover.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:   Our waitress was attentive, funny, a smartass (but in a good way) and made great recommendations.  We got to sit down quickly and the food was served pretty darn quick.  9 out of 10.  Atmosphere: The fiance and I sat at the big copper table where multiple parties can sit at.  At first, I was a little hesitant but at the end, I thought it was one of the coolest dining experiences.  We spoke to a bunch of random people and got great ideas of where to eat it.  We celebrated another person's birthday.  It was incredibly fun! 5 out of 5.  Overall:  Dick's is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  I am a sucker for great New Mexican food and Dick's is of no short supply of it.  27 out of 30 points, 5 out of 5 stars.",

Outside of the amazing ass food, the vibe is wonderful, the decor and feel is clean and welcoming. This shit should be a chain.

I was driving and couldn't find it. I knew we would have to look for it. My wife phoned in a Togo order so we just had to pick it up. Kinda exciting. We finally found the place and walked in. Kinda cool the inside. My wife spoke with a lady at the bar and paid. my wife handed me the receipt and said please give it back to her. The lady handed me the food and I responded I gave the final receipt to the bar guy. Also can I have utensils. She replies sure. I followed her through the restaurant so she didn't have to walk back. I was kinda excited and said we drove all the way from Vegas. The lady replies yea give me one sec. I was like wtf I wasn't rushing you. Rude!! Then after she gave the utensils I said thank you she said yea and walked away. Smh!!! The food was amazing!! I hate that the food was good. I wish I could tell y'all not to go but the food was amazing!!! We order the carne Asada Benedict and the shrimp with bacon and beans and rice. The food had all type of  flavors. I would go back just for the food. If the lady was nicer I would have gave more stars.",

The funky vibe, weird seating at the copper topped tables and zesty New-Mexico inspired cuisine in huge portions is the rest of it.  A random Tuesday at 2 pm and the place was pretty full, so that's a recommendation, as is the fact that there's daily brunch until 4 pm!  The salsa is zesty- ask for a sample if you're not sure.  The service wasn't speedy, but we were there to kick back until our flight home, so it suited us just fine.  Our drinks were continually topped up, the food was delicious and the service was super-nice- they gave us a clean menu with the date and our selection in the check register as a momento, just because!  I'll go back-if you can find it, you should too.  Tip- look for the number at the bottom of the glass door between the shrubs.  And plan to circle the parking area at least twice as you try to see it from the car.  They take the name seriously.",

I will return for the food only as the service was not lacking, but had a feel that we were a bother. We were seated before two other groups yet had our order taken last even though we were obviously ready and in turn had our food out just about the time one (who seated after us) table was paying the tab and exiting.   Perhaps this was just an off morning, but maybe not. In regards to the food it is top notch, but service is lacking. On my next trip To I will again hope for a better all around experience and perhaps up the stars.    Food - 5 Service - 2",

Chile relleno, enchiladas, green chile stew, carne adovada--all of them have been absolutely wonderful. I love that it's hard to find and whenever I take people here, they are always impressed.   The service is hit or miss and the inside is a little strange: dark, cold, crowded. That's fine. I'm not there for anything else except for the New Mexican food!",

    "text": "So many things  have been said that are very True. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. I read so many reviews about the Carne Adovada that I had to try it.  I ordered the shrimp scampi and the Adovada Sliders. The shrimp scampi was good... it sat on a bed of seasoned rice. Some of the rice was a tad dried out and hard but the flavor of the dish made it easy to ignore. The sliders were out right orgasmic...I don't even smoke and I would have said yes to a cigarette when I'm finished. There's not much more to say... if you like meat, you like pork ( I'm not normally a huge pork fan)and you can tolerate a little heat you'd be crazy not to try it.  The place is tiny but service is quick and pretty efficient. Plus I went during happy hour... Definitely got my money's worth.",

But you have a cook that travels with you in a chuck wagon. This cook is trained in all things amazingly tasty & secretly, he's trying to kill you - slowly. What I had at this place is what he feeds you every day.  Eggs Benedict Adovada. It is the most amazing decadent irresistible thing I've ever eaten. So as the cowboy, you'd eat it every day & after a few weeks you're too fat to get on your horse, your gun belt no longer fits & your chest hurts intermittently. And so one day, as an overweight, unarmed coronary walking the plains, you're shot by vaqueros & the cook smiles. YOU MUST GO HERE.",

Seating is interesting - bar area was full - big copper top table for 8 is open - and you share your meal time and conversation with others sitting at the same table.  Not really a problem, common in other cities - but new-ish to me here.  That aside - great service - and I loved my New Mexican Platter - Tamale, relleno, green burro, rice and beans, with combo green and red chile.  On the spicy/hot side - but expected that knowing the other Richardsons's menus.  All components were solid - but didn't make me stand and shout that I can't wait to go back.  Other diners were less pleased with their meals - one indicated his chicken was rather dry and flavorless... I'll encourage him to write a review.  I'd go back... but there are still a lot of Mexican/New Mexican places I'd like to try first...",

Service is awesome, the cooks are awesome, nice Mexican gentleman and a white guy that seem to make a great duo! Love the mimosas nice and strong!  Great Bar, great place for our community!

Being from San Francisco, he thought I would be impressed by their non-corporatism and lack of advertising (Dick's has no sign on the door)..  WE were offered a seat next to the fire place. It was cozy but we were sharing a table with another couple who came in behind us who we didn't know. That's fine, but they got up and left and our waitress informed us, 'they didnt belong here anyway'..  ok  My finance and I are not the richest couple in the land, however, we are highly attractive and generous tippers. The food came out very quickly. Not sure if that is a good thing.  Asked if I could sample the green chile sauce. I was charged $2.  My finance got up to use the restroom and the waitress snapped at me, 'Where did he go?' ..as if he was trying to escape without paying.  My fiance did not like his Bloody Mary, but waitress did not care to entice him with anything else.  We paid the bill with a card, left a cash tip and walked out the door only to have waitress run after us and ask us if we took a glass from the table.   I looked at her like she was a kook.

Our waiter was really awesome (I accidentally left his name on my menu but it started with a 'Th' and was quite different) and he gave us several good recommendations and top-notch customer service.

The ambiance itself is lovely, which makes it a great place for late night drinks. I wish I could say the same about the food.  We came in on a weekday for late night happy hour (from 3-6 pm and 9 pm to close). The happy hour menu is still pretty pricey. I ordered Skewers ($15) and found them to be dry and under seasoned. I have also had the Midwestern for brunch one time and was not impressed despite them using my favorite sausage (Schreiner's). My boyfriend has had the shrimp enchiladas numerous times and swears it's one of the best enchiladas he has ever had.   I will keep dining here as most people I know are big fans; I personally would rather spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "This place was awesome- atmosphere, food, service, everything.  The lighting is really dim and the vibe is intimate... Although I will warn that it seemed a lot of tables were large and communal. My party of 4 lucked out and got a private nook table that afforded us privacy and was tucked away by our own TV in the front room. I noticed though, that the parties at the communal table seemed to all be laughing and affable and talking with each other, which was nice!   The menus are heavily Tex Mex themed.  All the dishes feature beans/tortilla/green chiles, etc... even the steaks carry the theme. But the food was very hearty and, while a bit pricey, it was truly delicious! My friend ordered off the specials menu (check the blackboard!) and got a steak with scallops, which he said was amazing. The Carne Adovada (smoked pork roast simmered in red chile, with cheese, rice, beans & a flour tortilla) featured fall-off-the-bone tender meat that had been simmered in a heavy chile sauce. Everyone enjoyed it but it was a tad spicy for me (i'm a wuss). I opted for the Seafood Linguine (jumbo shrimp and scallops over fresh pasta, white wine sauce, tomatoes, spinach and parmesan). It was surprisingly light for a pasta dish! No heavy creamy sauce, but a nice light white wine sauce and some tomatoes/spinach thrown in for color and brightness. The shrimp and scallops were huge and really well seasoned. I loved it, and had leftovers for lunch the next day.   A must order is the Roasted Garlic Plate appetizer (with green chile, roasted peppers, cheese & dipping sauces). The plate was HUGEEEE and the elephant garlic was equally gigantic and soft as could be. Amazing to spread over toasted bread with a bit of the peppers and melted cheese. A huge hit, but beware your breath after...   All in all, really enjoyed this hidden gem and would definitely recommend it if you're willing to drop a few extra $ for dinner one night!   Parking was easy outside in the little strip mall.",

Pretty good selection of beers on tap.  Take that back, maybe 8 or 10 on tap but had one I liked so it was good for me.  I ordered carne adovada because I am in search of some tasting as good as I used to get in Albuquerque.  This was pretty tasty but I would not order it if you don't like to be surprised by a big glob of fat.  Several of them in there but hey, that is where the flavor is.  Anyway I could only eat about half of the giant portion until I cried uncle.  The staff was really great.  Every single one asked if I needed anything, checked in about every five minutes or so   All very pleasant.  It is a small place so you are kind of elbow to elbow but very much worth going.",

Intimate, dimly lit, open kitchen bar counter is where it's at. 2 dining rooms w 4-5 tables each one convertible to private dining room.   The food is awesome. Carne Adovada or Mole with tortilla beans and rice are my two favorite dishes. The meat is cooked juicy and they bring New Mexican inspired flavors spices to their recipes.   As a disclaimer, The food is spicy. Be forewarned. But they always have awesome market selections for beef and fish on the chalk board if you want to go off the traditional menu items.   This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.",

Literally a hidden gem in an otherwise ordinary strip mall.  No signs on the outside other than the \"Sorry, We're Open\" sign very low on the door.  Just a set of double doors between two bushes separate the outside world from this cavern-like bar with intimate seating nooks.  Our group of 5 had a blast the entire night.  This is most definitely one of the best local places for entertaining guests and eating a fantastic meal.  I chose the Enchilada plate and had several options.  Went with one green chile pork, one smoked turkey, and one shrimp enchilada.  Serving size was huge and it was served on a large cast iron plate.  Will spread the word about this place and will definitely be back with friends and family.",

Great music but not too loud, so you can still hear yourself think and hear your conversation. They have an open concept kitchen where you can see it all happening and although the staff are doing a million things at once there was not a single moment where we felt forgotten, they were attentive from the moment we walked in. Now, to talk about the food... First off, we got a chicken quesadilla which was every bit as cheesy and delicious as it was filled with tender chicken and came with sides of fresh red salsa and spicy green salsa. Then came our crispy and yummy Cesar salad which comes with our entree of the New Mexican Surf and Turf. So, this entree.. Where to start... The tenderloin was cook exactly to the perfect juicy medium rare, that was topped with flawlessly grilled shrimp which was wrapped in crisp bacon, I recommend savoring every bite because although large shrimp..they disappear from your plate too soon! Last but not least, the chorizo enchiladas, which they do almost like a tostada actually...Some background about me, I've been eating chorizo since I was 5, all kinds and it's hit or miss... This was a bullseye hit, the absolute best Chorizo I've ever had in my entire 26 years of life. Incredible flavor, tender and melts away with the accompaniment of a delicious cheesy black bean tortilla. I want to bring everyone I love here.",

Now I know for next time. It's snug and warm and homey in here, with a nice bar selection and friendly service. We had breakfast and were not disappointed. My french toast was crisped and golden, cooked through and served with real maple syrup. My pal's tamale and eggs were quite good as well. Roasted pork, a bit spicy in savory masa with a couple of fried eggs on top. I love the aroma breezing throughout of freshly charred meat. Really nice breakfast, and I'd revisit for sure.",

The vibe is dark and cozy the carne adovada with eggs plate massive and tasty, and a good selection of craft beers on tap. I try to get here every few weeks for breakfast and it's always good. The coffee  is fine, but it's not like pinon coffee. The staff is terrific, Adam and Jason are always attentive without getting in the way. The adovada uses smoked red chiles which aren't so much my style but it's hearty and solid nonetheless. Fine selection of tequila but not as good as Maria's in santa fe. Such a great place. Back here after a long hike the day before and Dick's always aims to please.  Update 11 Nov 2018: early morning, Sunday. Food is great as always. Blonde lady behind bar seems uninterested in being attentive unless she knows the bar patron. Great way to ruin a nice plate of carne adovada and eggs. Have to keep asking for coffee refill, mentioned to her the coffee was cold, she said \"hey, it's cold here too\", I guess meaning the kitchen side of bar.",

The portion was massive and I could barely eat half of it but it was delicious.   I saw others at the restaurant drinking mimosas which looked incredible (all the juices are fresh-squeezed apparently)  The bar looks really cool and I'd love to try the dinner place next door, which is surrounded by wine racks and has a large wooden table in the middle great for groups.

    "text": "Cool, so very cool.    We were visiting Phoenix and thought we'd take a shot and look for a New Mexican restaurant.   I stumbled upon Dick's thanks to Yelp.  Based on other reviews we knew we'd have to \"look\" for it.  We got to the area and I did something other reviewers evidently did not think of - I called.  The guy who answered the phone was super helpful and guided me in.  The ambiance is really cool - and cool.  Dark inside and great AC.  We sat at the back of the place,  the area was really interesting,  great view of the rest of the place and very well laid out.   The staff were extremely attentive,  knowledgeable,  and just great people to be around.  Food,  please note that my husband is from ABQ so the bar is a bit higher for restaurants that serve New Mexican food.  The menu has great twists on traditional N.M. fare.  They elevated the typical and blew me away with other really great choices.  We happen to make it during happy hour - which the food and drink options are fantastic.   It was Sunday so I was happily surprised that they even offered happy hour.  We started off with the garlic platter and BBQ pork sliders - sorry I cannot remember the exact name but they were super.  The platter was huge,  garlic roasted perfectly along with the peppers.  The green chili sauce was fantastic.  HUGE portions!  The sliders were very, very good.    My friends had the surf and turf and my husband had the chicken cordon blue.  WOW!  The steak was cooked perfectly and so tender.  Thanks Brian for sharing. The cordon blue was nontraditional and spectacular.  Open face with topped with the most wonderful creamy green chili sauce.  The portions for the appetizers were so big I did not order an entree.  Thank God!  My husband and friends could not finish their dinners although they tried.  I am really shocked at some of the reviews - maybe they were expecting typical NM food?  I really love this place.  When I am visiting Phoenix I will do my best to work in Dicks.  To the serves/tenders - guys you are fantastic.  Just keep doing what you do.",

The brunch food was really good but super heavy and saucy. I had one of the benedicts with the smokey red chile sauce...it was good but i felt like i had lead in my stomach and i only got into about a quarter of the meal. My daughter's french toast was top notch -- legit crusty leftover bread made into pain perdu. YUM. One complaint and I know that they don't cater to the child-variety crowd but it would have been nice to order her something smaller, their french toast was Andre the Giant sized. I'd definitely be back but splitting an entree and drinking alot because if i recall they had a pretty rad brunch drink special.",

    "text": "I am a visitor to Arizona and on my many trips here have been in search of great Mexican food - to no avail.    My sister and I ate at Dick's Hideaway (related to Richards Northern New Mexican Cuisine - just down the street).  We ate from the bar menu - a scaled down version of the regular menu and ordered the New Mexican Queso Dip, Rich's Skewer, and the Duck Relleno.  We also got a small sample of the Carne Adovada - the particular item that is Dick's Hideaway most favored dish.  Okay, there is great - along with good, and a few hits and misses.  The very best thing we ate was the queso.  Delicious!  Cohito cheese, onion, spinach, and chorizo with chips.  I've not had any queso like this anywhere and I am FROM Northern New Mexico.    (I found out that the owner of the restraunt lived in Santa Fe for awhile - which explains the \"twists\" on all his traditional NORTHERN New Mexican dishes.)  FYI - northern New Mexico food is very different from Mexico, California, Arizona, Texas, and southern New Mexican food.  Next we had the skewer - four meats on a skewer with; pork, beef, sausage, and shrimp.  All the meats were very good but the four sauces served with this meal made the dish a stand out.  The onion sauce and jalapeno hollandaise sauce were good but the Chipotle and tomatillo sauces were mouth watering!  Oh, and the New Mexican sausage was really good.  I really recommend it.  We ordered the Duck Relleno with Christmas (both red AND green chili sauces.)  Now here are some of the misses.    First strike was that the Relleno was breaded in panko crumbs and deep fried - big chili Relleno no no!  A Relleno should be dipped in egg white then pan-fried.  Many, many New Mexicans make this mistake too.  It's very hard to find a good Relleno in New Mexico too.   The duck tasted like turkey and after it came out of the fryer I couldn't tell it had any breading on it at all.  Although the green chili was delicious, the red chili was over salted and bitter - not good by anyone's description.  And lastly, the thing I looked forward to most was the Carne Adovada.  The Adovada had a smokey flavor (they smoke the meat) and it was sweet.  The smoke flavor was interesting but I just couldn't get past the sweet.  I can't like it.  New Mexican Adovada should be very rich in chili flavor and with a lingering bite to it.    The menu states the chili policy: You order it...you own it.  I found it very mild and anyone should be able to take the heat.  All in all, okay with some major misses.  Still looking for great Mexican food in Arizona.  Suggestions anyone?",

If you can, head on over right now because the flavor is off the bitch-nizzle. (I don't know what that means, but I think I heard it in a rap song -- and yes, bitch-nizzle is hyphenated.)   This place is hard to find. It is the red headed stepchild of Richardson's, and used to be in the same complex. I think Richardson's burned down or had a fire or something. That isn't surprising with how spicy their food is. Anyway, after the fire Richardson's moved down the street and Dick's stayed in the same spot. I don't think there is any sign outside, so you have to know where the place is. They provide you with an address. Armed with that, Google Maps should be able to take it from there.",

Then we checked out the specials for Dick's and wanted to eat those NOW! The smell and the descriptions of the dishes got us really excited especially considering the number of people waiting to be seated at this tiny signless joint.  I ordered the salmon special with shrimp chipotle sauce. It was garlicky and buttery and spicy and somehow incredibly light. The carrots and broccolini were cooked perfectly and chef's chipotle twice baked potato was genius! Instead of a potato shell they used a roasted poblano chile. I am totally stealing that for my next dinner party.  My boyfriend ordered the New Mexican plate which was an extraordinary amount of food. I tried a bite of the masa and for me it was too dry, but the spices were excellent.  Next time we will hit up Rokerij for their small plates.",

Anyway, once inside we were greeted quickly. The main area consisted of a long bar and a few tables, but it was full. So, we got the next best thing...our own large table in the private party room. Ok? I thought. But, I was hungry and really craving New Mexican cuisine. After a short wait, our food came. I got the New Mexican Sampler. It consisted of rice, beans, a burro, a enchilada, and quesadilla. The burro and quesadilla were yummy, but the enchilada was a little too dry for my taste. The beans and rice were good too. The only negative was that the entire platter was topped with a ton of cheese. That probably explains why they have pizza on the menu. Also, my dining partner ordered the quesadilla sampler and the cheese was prevalent again. I guess going forward you can always ask for less cheese. Otherwise, the food here is good and hearty. Don't come with a light apetite.",

    "text": "Color this native New Mexican girl IMPRESSED!!  My family (on both sides) has lived in NM for many generations. So I would like to think I know my NM food (I can cook it up and I was raised on it.)  This place had been on my list for quite a while now. I am always in search of good NM cuisine, especially when I am not in the mood to cook it all up myself.   I had stopped in one Sunday morning and was unwilling to wait for a seat. So I turned around. Vowing to try it again another day.  Well folks Friday (2/11) was that day. Parking on the other side of the chinese restaurant, I walked towards the entrance hoping I could get in, as it was a Friday after 6pm.  My timing was impeccable. There were 3 open seats at the bar, but I only needed one. The restaurant is dimly lit and the aroma of smoke from their grill lightly permeates the restaurant. Smelled faintly of my grandmothers kitchen, as she still uses a large wood cook stove to prepare most of her meals.  Taking a seat at the bar, the stools wobbled and I feared my phat ass would end up on the floor so I tried not to move around too much as I begin my wait. Admittedly they were busy and the place is quaint and cozy (aka small). . A couple that walked in 10 min after me claimed the 2 seats next to me at the bar and waited with me for another 5+ minutes. WHAT?! The waiter/manager walked up and handed them menus...as he turned to leave and fetch them some water, I turned back politely and asked him for a menu and water also. (Feeling a bit invisible as I had been waiting for a bit and couldn't get anyone's attention.) The man sitting next to me passed me his menu as he knew what he was already going to order.   Receiving my water and finally able to place an order for a beer, I continued to watch the guys at work in the kitchen as the flames and red coals from the wood fired grill lured me into a daydream that distracted me from making a decision on what to order.  Luckily to took them awhile to take my order. I couldn't make up my mind they had a great menu and some wonderful looking specials on the chalkboard behind me.   Finally, I decided on the Taos Combo they had on the specials board, which included 2 Schriners New Mexican sausages, 2 bacon wrapped grilled shrimp and 2 rolled blue corn green chile enchiladas stuffed with cheese and lightly smokey cubes of pork and rice and beans of course.  Once ordered it came out relatively quickly. Very generous portions served on their famous metal platters. Everything was delicious and well seasoned (simple). The flavors imparted on the sausages and shrimp from the wood grill were delicious and the shrimp were perfectly tender. The blue corn tortillas were real blue corn, not white corn with blue dye like I experienced at another restaurant recently.   So much food I took more than half home for leftovers later.   So why 4 and not 5 stars....I was pretty much invisible to the staff for the first 15 minutes of my visit. They did get busier later but they are experienced at handling a crowd. I shouldn't have had to wait so long initially.",

    "text": "Off night, perhaps?  We went to Dick's for dinner last night.  I ordered the \"New Mexican\" platter.  I lived next to a chile field in Las Cruces,NM for four years, walking distance to the Mesilla plaza, so I know quality New Mexican cuisine.  I was not impressed in the least.  My burro was COLD in the middle.  Like out of the fridge cold.  When I told the waiter he didn't bat an eye, like it happens all the time, and had the kitchen make me another.  They did comp me a beer for the experience, but my meal was already ruined; by the time the replacement burro made it to the table I was already full.  I am a big chile relleno fan; I try the relleno everywhere I go.  I did not like Dick's relleno; the chile was stringy and not spicy, and there was so much (yellow) cheese and sauce on top that the batter was mushy, not crispy.  I seriously prefer the rellenos at Filibertos to this one.  I did like their red sauce; it is difficult to find red sauce that is appropriately spicy in Phoenix.  I've had better green sauce though.  Overall, this meal made me miss New Mexico more that ever.  On the plus side, the service was impeccable, the atmosphere in the \"wine room\" we were seated in is lovely (minus the unnecessary TV), and the drinks were decent.  My husband liked his bloody mary.  I would give this place another chance, but this particular experience was disappointing.",

The combo adds a pair of enchiladas and asparagus with hollandaise sauce to eggs benedict jalapeno. The eggs benedict jalapeno is totally awesome, if you have not tried it your really missing out on something special. Everyone I have brought here has loved it.",

I saw an amazing salad go by, and wish I ordered that or the sausages. Sigh.  Update - I had their spinach salad there last night and it was pretty good. Still, I think their prices are high considering what you get. I'm going to stick with the 4/5 stars.",

Carne adovada with eggs, beans, potatoes, cheese, and tortillas.  Red chile sauce.  The room smelled like a campfire.   So so good.  I would also like to take this oppurtunity to thank the idiot legislators who passed the law whereby I cannot order a Bloody Mary before 10am on Sunday while enjoying the best breakfast ever at Dick's Hideway.  Why Sunday?  Some drunk can order one before work Mon - Fri, but I can't on my day off?  Well, at least I can still take my handgun with me....  Thank you for listening.",

I like that you kind of eat and drink at the bar, and the bathroom is hidden somewhere in the kitchen.  And I also like that there isn't a sign outside and you just have to know where the place is.  Drinks are of good price considering the warm, upscale(ish) atmosphere of the place.  They also have a happy hour, during which you get a free snack-sized piece of food alongside your discounted drinks.  At last check they did a reverse happy hour also, which I'm a sucker for.  Why the minus-1 star?  I took a very large group of people on a bar crawl through my favorite intersection, and Dick's Hideaway was one of the stops.  We literally filled the place.  I accidentally broke a Stella glass (the True form of accident, not the drunk kind), and the bartender was pretty rude about it.  But that won't stop me from going back.",

I was not a fan of the filet mignon breakfast or the way they do the beans on the tortillas but it was an ok experience. The next time we decided to try it for an early dinner but then decided to sit at the bar since happy hour is 5$ for appetizers(small plates). This is where the place really shines. The onion rings are the best I have had, The filet mignon skewers were excellent. The bacon wrapped shrimp were good but nothing to write about, but the prime ribsliders were top notch. We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon.   Go at happy hour and sample some small plates.",

Well, OK when you're 90 and sitting in a rocking chair telling your life story to your great grandchildren it might not come up, but it is something you will tell your friends and coworkers about - but only if you do it right.  Dick's offers some standard breakfast dishes like eggs, pancakes and french toast. But you can get those dishes at just about any place that's open at 7am.  You really want to give their New Mexican dishes a try.  A personal favorite is the carne adovada and eggs but I don't think you can wrong with any of the dishes. Go on, be adventurous.

There was no sign, and the only reason I recognized it was because there was a sign hanging inside the door with the other restaurants in the 'family's' names on them.  There was a private party in the dining room, which made it even more cramped than most people have described. We were at a ledge facing the wall in the back of the bar. The coziness didn't bother me, but I could see how it might not be loved by everyone.  I had to order the carne adovado after all the rave reviews, and it was definitely equal to its reputation. I wished I didn't have breakfast plans for the next morning, because I would have loved to have made another meal. I love spicy food, and it was definitely up there on the heat scale. My dining companion ordered the sliders and the waiter was very good about not putting chile sauce on them.  I was drinking beer, but the wine list looked good and the bar was well stocked. It was definitely worth the struggle to find it. Be patient!",

We had the two most raved about plates from what I've read:  Carne Adovada and Pasta Heidi. Both did not disappoint.  The plates came out piping hot; in temperature and flavor. The pork was very moist and tasty. The rice and beans accompanied the pork well. The spicy green chile cream sauce in the pasta was delicious. The pasta had nice texture and the chicken was juicy with nice grilled flavor. Who would've thought tortillas would go well with pasta. Although, this was probably placed on the plate to hold the sauce in with the pasta. Well, we used it with the pasta was we would with a piece of garlic bread. The servings were large and enough for sharing and then some.   The restaurant might be a little hard to find since it is sort of a \"hideaway\". We didn't have too much trouble since I did some homework before coming here. Thanks to our gps to locate which corner it was on, the reviewer that mentioned it was next to Lucy's to narrow it down to an area, and the online menu that I previewed prior to coming to find the front door of this place. LOL. We luckily pulled up into a parking space right in front of their door and I immediately recognized their menu displayed outside from previewing it online.  Must go back for brunch one day!",

Come in, and find a cool, dark comfy spot (the best show is at the bar, where you will watch the master chef assemble your feast) with some of the best New Mexican cuisine you have even heard of. Get the Richardson's combo of Jalapeno Benedict and Enchiladas, or better yet, the best non-mom Meatloaf a la Vic. You WILL be back, so do not worry that everything looks delicious; order the first thing that catches your fancy (adovada if you cannot decide), then get the next thing tomorrow, and the next thing the day after that... Get a drink, sit back, and await the love your tastebuds will receive.",

    "text": "Ok. I'll be the first to say that the food is good and in the Summer, it's nice, dark and cool inside. However, here is what the 1star rating is about.  I have eaten in there and ordered food to go a number of times!! I'm done.  They (Rokrij, Dick's Hideaway and Richardson's) are a Phoenix institution and they know it. The staff really couldn't care less that you are there because they feel entitled to business. They give off the attitude that THEY are doing YOU a favor! The final straw was that a person in our party really didn't like their meal and asked nicely for a replacement. (The description on the menu wasn't enough and granted, she could have asked questions, but the waiter/'bartender' wasn't attentive, and would have been annoyed.) SO at ANY OTHER ESTABLISHMENT they would have taken the meal and gladly replaced it. Not Dick's! (Aptly named!) They groaned, made a new dish and charged her for BOTH!!!  Also, I had ordered a cocktail off of THEIR cocktail menu. The waiter/'bartender' had no idea how to make it and just winged it! 11.00 or so for a 1st try, reading ingredients off the menu cocktail?! Not exceptable.  Please see my review of Richardson's for yet another crazy example of their entitlement mentality! In a city of literally thousands of good restaurants, and more opening every week; why would you subject yourself to this?",

    "text": "This place has charm - and their food is certainly above average - especially if you're a fan of New Mexican cuisine (which I'm not) you'd be hard pressed to find a better example of it.  The plates are all flavorful, well executed, and are served in highly sharable portions.    DH does a great job of creating the classy dive bar experience - limited seating in a dark cave - highly conducive to meeting your neighbors and starting conversation.   Some of the items can get a little pricy considering the atmosphere - but Dick's does a good job of balancing out the menu with more affordable items too.  I  Two things:  1.  there is a good chance you will be sitting under an air condition vent or fan - so if you're not a fan of having air blown in your face or get cold easily - you might consider wearing a jacket.  2.  since the wood fired stove is part of the experience - you'll likely end up leaving with a distinct campground odor upon leaving the establishment - not always a bad thing - but something to keep in mind when deciding on where to grab drinks pre-opera.",

Yes, I like beef, and this place has plenty of it! Splurge and get beef tenderloin benedict for breakfast.  The service is good, but they aren't there to pamper you. You can kinda figure that out when you walk in or if you just think about the name! Don't bring your kids if they're small, but really, it's not a place for kids anyway even if they're not small.(No high chairs!) It's for grown ups.  I've gone here at least 5 times, and I can't tell you where the bathroom is or if they even have one. Or the elusive back door.  Guess I'll have to go back and find it!",

But when I asked the waitress if there was anything on the menu that could be made without cheese, she looked at me like I was retarded and said, \"You really should just order a salad.\"  I knew what I was getting into when we came here, so I was prepared to eat something doused in cheese, but I bet other restaurants/chefs would have at least tried to accommodate a request like that. I even asked if the chili relleno could be stuffed with the beans/rice side dish instead of cheese, and the waitress said no (the beans are made with pork broth anyway, so it was a moot point).   Oh well. It is very rich and tasty food, but if you are strict vegan and you come here with a group (which would be the only reason a vegan would even walk in the door), eat at home or plan to stop at Green afterwards.",

The Hideaway was such a great local secret - waving to the hostess at Richardson's, walking through the kitchen and to the back entrance to an spot at Dick's always felt like I was a VIP in an exclusive group.  I no longer live in walking distance, but still make it back for their fantastic food.  Instead of reviewing the dishes (already well covered here), I'll just issue this statement - for those that can't handle spice, it may be difficult to find something truly bland here.  I love the melange, but some tender-tongues I've brought with me have been a little disappointed.  Okay, you got me - I couldn't leave without a couple food comments!  You cannot go wrong with the mixed grill special - no matter what it is.  Hell, any of the specials, really.  It's been so long since I ate from the regular menu that I just keep up to date by stealing smells and bites from my friends.  And I still love that GCP, but am one of the few that is NOT a fan of the Pasta Heidi (to me, it's just okay, you know?).  Oh, and if you could do me the favor of ignoring my five star review and never coming to this place, I'd appreciate it.  I like still coming here and having my seat available.  Thanks.",

Would have said there isn't a better place to hang out on an afternoon anywhere.  Unfortunately, they have gone the micro brew route and don't carry Bud Light any longer.  Yes your youngsters like the micro brew but are they really the ones who spend money at your restaurant.  I certainly don't like the bartender looking down his nose at me because of what I request.  I did the micro brew thing and got it out of my system.  I want something I don't need to drink with a spoon so I can enjoy the food.  If I need to pair something I will do it with wine.  Still love the food but not without the cocktail I choose.  I will take my appetite, my wife's taste in wine, my taste in after dinner drinks, my friends and my company events (none of which are inexpensive) somewhere they stock what the masses drink.  And no, having Coors Light and Miller Light doesn't get us there.  The best quote from \"The Millionaire Next Door\" - I only drink two kinds of beer, Bud Light and Free and would gladly pay for Bud Light.  Remember who pays your bills folks.",

I don't even like eggs and I ate more than half of the 3 that were served on the dish I ordered.  My breakfast was Carne Adovada and it was fabulous!!  We are making it a point to go back in a couple of weeks with a relative who is coming in from England.  We know he will love it!  We can't wait to go back! Both of the people who waited on us were wonderful and very pleasant.",

There were weekends we would eat there Fri. dinner, Saturday lunch, and Sunday breakfast. Yes that's a little much but this place is that good. Is the sirloin burrito still off the menu? Order it, they still make it. Anything you order will be excellent. Best burger in Phoenix. They cook over an open flame wood fired grill. Salads are top notch. Fish plates are always the best. All with a New Mexican(state not country) style. Great bar. Fantastic wine cellar dining room if you get the pleasure of eating in there, as some nights that's where they seat you. I love this place. My favorite restaurant in the country.",

Lets thanks my friend for taking me here and then lets thank the chef for the great tasting food. I had a NY Strip Steak with crab meat on it. The sauce had heat but not too much to burn your mouth. Which was excellent. I've always said that food needs to tell a story and this dish had a subtle beginning and an amazing end. The service was friendly and fast. The decor well it looks like a hideaway so that's actually kinda cute! The prices seemed reasonable for the food and the flavor. I'd go again!",

Friday night--we had planned to go to a movie afterward--HOWEVER--the food took 2 hours to get to us. We were escorted from the main area Dick's, facing Bethany to the other section, Richardson's facing 16th street. The waitress was the only one serving that section, everyone must've called in sick, classy woman 40ish. She remembered everyone's order without writing a thing down and amazingly the server knew everyone's order without asking who had what! Food was incredibe!--Gourmet--I had bacon rolled with feta on a stick--absolutely grand. However, since it took so long to get our food the movie was out of the question. This place needs to hire more people if not already. I only give them 3 stars because of the wait.",

Dick's consists of a bar with a handful of tables it also has a room connected for private parties which they occasionally open so it never hurts to ask if you can sit there when they don't have it reserved.   I plan on going there many more times to try as many things as possible because frankly it all sounds good and I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. The services matches the quality of the food as well.   Living close to Richardson's/Dick's make trying new places difficult knowing that I could have easily gone to Dick's instead.   They also have Dos Equis amber on tap (as well as lager) which should be as mandatory for a Mexican cuisine restaurant as a bathroom.",

If Richardson's around the corner is packed, or you are looking for a new brunch option, stroll around the corner to Dick's.  Keep in mind that this place is literally a nook, so go with a small party rather than 50 of your closest friends.  The place is kind of sexy as it is, so an initmate gathering would be a better call.  Food is delicious, smoking hot, and inventive.  Not a chips and salsa joint, but more like inspired New Mexican cuisine.  They take some liberties with their green and red chile laden menu, but the dishes impress nonetheless.",

In the past the food was what it was all about for breakfast anyways, it was fantastic! The service from one main individual has always been poor to fair. He always seems to be to busy and yu are a bother to him. This time there was a new guy who was the opposite in nature but always apologizing for being new. We arrived at 905 am and was soon asked about drinks. I have always liked the spicy bloody mary they serve so ok two please. The next time we finaaly got the servers attention was at 947 and our food came around 1026. The service was horrible! again the regular guy was paying all his attention to everyone at the bar who all but two came in long after us. They all got waited on and some even served before we were able to order. I had to call the place on my cellphone to get the attention of anyone to order some food! Then my food came and my plate was so dried out! The beans were stuck to the plate, hard and dried up. The potatoes the same. The Eggs Benedit which I love were hard, the sauce dry and the pork, my favorite all dry too as if it had sat for awile keeping warm. The others plates were fine and all moist! When I finnally got the attention again of the waite I was confronted by a defensive reaction and basically blown off. I must say i used to love this place but I dont think I will frequent for a while. I will try Luci's next door, they seem friendly and the food was half the price!",

Because of John N's review, I had the sense to just call them from the start to see exactly where they were located.  Once I got there I was actually very pleasantly surprised by the aesthetic of this little hole in the wall, it is WELL worth the search!  Inside is VERY small, but still remarkably private, with a very cozy atmosphere.  I felt like the place was a little dark at first, but once my eyes adjusted it was no problem at all.  The atmosphere is one that would be fun and welcoming whether you're on a date, or out with a friend! My friend and I both had a Mimosa (which was made with fresh squeezed orange juice), a glass of wine (most of their wine was at a very reasonable price of $5 a glass until 5:30 everyday), and the Benedict Combo. I got my Benedict Combo with the grilled fish, and it was delicious, and came in a very generous portion! My only complaint was that I felt the service was a little slow to begin with. Over all, I was incredibly impressed with Dick's, and I just know I'll be back!",

But as the place is under remodel we weren't quite sure where to enter and so we went in here.  It was very dark and noisy, I felt the music was too loud, but at the time I didn't know that this was the bar.  Anyway we weren't in a great mood to party and so that put a damper on the dinner.  So in all honesty, I will have to go back and try it when we aren't being so pissy.  The service was slow, the water tasted off, the shrimp quesadillas weren't worth the money, but the pork green chile rellano's were delicious, spicy, smokey and flavorful.  I felt the beans and rice were okay, could have been cooked a little more thoroughly.  I also thought the price $15 was a little high for 2 rellano's, should be more like $12, but I won't bitch and moan for $3.  The order of pork gc enchiladas for take away lunch the next day were very tasty and much appreciated.  So as I said maybe it was our pissy mood, we'll see next time at Richardson's.",

True to his word, it was kind of hard to find since it's so small and there's no sign out front.  It's a tiny little place and we sat in the small, side-room without the bar.  The menu is split between creative American entrees and solidly Mexican dishes.  The posole soup I started with was really good, with a nice spice to it, but the raw cabbage sliced on top was a little too big to eat easily in a soup.  For my main, I went with the enchiladas which were very good, but not extraordinary.  I tried a friend's pork dish, the pork adovado, which was outstanding - i wish I had ordered that.  Had a nice glass of pinot noir that was too cold when it arrived at the table, but after it warmed up and got some air was really flavorful.  All in all, I liked Dick's but should've ordered better.",

Thanks much to the reviewer who mentioned there was no sign and to just look for the address above the door. I don't think I would have found it otherwise.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very nice bartender who promptly made us a couple of proper and tasty margaritas with fresh squeezed limejuice.  We asked him what he would his favorite app was and he recommended the seared scallops with four sauces. I don't think it was even on the menu.  They were very fresh and grilled perfectly and the accompanying sauces were SW influenced but nicely paired for the Smokey scallops.  We watched the chef deftly grill everything from chicken and steak to Mahi Mahi over a wicked hot pecan wood fire.  He was a True grill master. We had a couple of anchor steams with rest of dinner and were quite happy with the $65 bill. A great deal at an out of the way little bar with killer food.  Definitely Yelpy!",

So I ask one of the waitstaff where can I sit. The two four tops are wide open and so is the deuce that faces the wall. I asked him if I could sit at the 4 since it was way past lunch and not likely to get busy again until the dinner rush. He said \"wherever you like\". So I sit down and the next member of the waitstaff comes over and asks \"how many in your party\"?  I said it was only me. She said \"we only allow 2-4 to sit at these tables\". Good by Dick's!  You're completely HIDDEN from my future dining plans. I told the server I didn't want to stay and thanks for making me feel so welcome!",

Not the most affordable meal by any stretch. More like LA/NY prices but definitely worth it.  Visited around 5pm on a weekday and the place was dark. It's supposed to be dark, I was told. I ordered the steak and shrimp tacos and they were excellent. From the moment my face started to melt (was sitting at the bar near the grill) to the moment I saw the cheese melt on the plate, I was hooked the whole way...and then I ate the whole thing in 4 minutes. Fully Yelp-driven, that was my one and only visit.  I can't wait to go back.",

I got the Santa Fe chicken, and was thinking of horseradish sauce instead of hollandaise sauce, but the bar tender's excuse for not having a kick to the sauce was the jalapenos are not as hot in the summer. WRONG! The hotter and dryer the hotter the pepper. No big deal right? Well the bar tender became a d.bag after I asked for more sauce, more than he already was for having a man-bun. I believe his name was Tag, but just asking for more sauce is no reason to act like that. He also said cheers; come-on bro, you're not British. He also gossiped with a female employee for over 5 min, when I waiting to cash out. In many ways the Service was slightly above average as a whole. I was going to give an extra star for seeing them clean a vent hood, till I saw someone's food on the grill right below it. The place did not have a Mexican taste at all.",

The decor was eclectic and kind of cozy but right off the bat asked the waiter where the owners were from Wisconsin but they had spent some time in NM which had me a little puzzled but I was optomistic,. Asked for chips and salsa and they brought pico, and mediocre tomatillo. The green chili potatoes were supposedly their specialty so had to try that with our relleno plate even tho none of the Mexican dishes cane with it. The rellenos s had no spice at all very bland and disappointing. My son in law ordered the 45.00 steak which was the size of a silver dollar and not cooked to order.

The seating area is small and you might actually feel claustrophobic so keep that in mind. The bathroom is a co-Ed single person option. Please also note you walk through part of the kitchen to get to the bathroom, kind of makes it unique ! Portions are hearty and full of flavor and well worth the penny. It's a must try for your southwestern taste buds and cravings! Enjoy the specials as they are fresh and fun. Please also spot the humorous signs throughout hidden gem!

So, you might wonder, \"why only three stars\"?  Well, I'm a regular customer- I know the names of the bartenders and the chefs/cooks.  As a result, they know when I walk through the door that I drink Basil Hayden bourbon, and the Chipotle ribs.  So, when I walk in and every other week they are out of Basil Hayden (indicating that I'm not the only one drinking it), that they should be alert to a need to keep the supply stocked.  I don't want to blame bartender for a failure by management to recognize purchasing patterns, but sometimes I have to shoot the messenger; but that hasn't worked.  So, now, I'm posting a three star review, in the hopes it'll motivate an owner or manager to maintain me as a regular costumer by being attentive.  Yes, I could go to the Rokerj or Richardson's and get it...but since they are all the same owner, I'm not going to do it.  So, this is my cry for help before I go to Hillstone, or Linger Linger Lounge, or even The Vig across the street, because I can assure you they won't run out.  Owners, feel free to make it right and my adjusted stars will reflect that you responded.",

They have pretty good wines on their list, but their margaritas are amazing.  The food is really spicy, my husband was in heaven.  I had the carne adovada sliders, so delicious and my husband had the pork, shrimp and beef enchiladas.  I had a taste of each of them, they were so yummy.  They also have a room for private parties, you can reserve it with $500, that will towards the bill that night, so it is a pretty good deal if you have a large group and you want to enjoy their food and drinks. Hmmm, my birthday is coming up pretty soon!",

    "text": "When you walk to the door at Dick's Hideaway you're immediately greeted by the aroma of slow roasting pork wafting through the air. My mouth was watering before even being seated. This place is small and seating is limited, almost cramped...but I was happy that we were seated so quickly, given it was a busy Friday night. If you're lucky enough to have a seat at the bar you can watch all the action take place live.. However, if your a party of two, be forewarned that you could be seated at a very small table where both guests are literally staring at a wall.  Fortunately, the cramped seating and odd view are quickly forgotten when the food arrives. Both dishes were succulent and moist, not to mention full flavor. The server was friendly and was quick to bring over a couple of wine samples before having to make a final decision.  Another Yelper commented on the cold temperature within the restaurant. Granted it was about 113 on the day of our visit, but if there was air conditioning on in the restaurant I couldn't feel it. All in all, Dick's Hideaway is a terrific local gem. I'd like to go back and try their brunch at some point.",

Words can't describe this dish. They've perfected it for sure. On point on key! MUST TRY!  I also was brave enough to order the Green Chile Cheese sliders. Brave I say because all this food I was prepared to take down. The C.A.B was enough but to add this was madness. (Mind you I ordered all this at the beginning). Those sliders definitely had a nip to them. 7/10 for those. But the C.A.B  was definitely a 9.5/10.  Go here, be amazed.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Tiny, hidden restaurant that delivers some top notch New Mexican cuisine.    Now I lived in New Mexico for 2 years and ate a ton of quality New Mexican food. It's been quite awhile since I had the good stuff, but then I stumbled in to Dick's hideaway and remembered what I'd been missing. Our table shared a bunch of different appetizers, each of which was delicious.   I went with the signature dish - Carne Adovada and was not disappointed. Way too much food for one person to eat, but I didn't mind trying.  If you love carnitas (Pork) you'll likely love this.  Additionally we got to sit in the side room that looks like a large wine cellar because we had a big party.  One thing to note, none of the bottles in the room are actually drinkable wines. They're just there for show and apparently left overs from when the original restaurant had a fire.   Service was good and attentive.  Overall cool atmosphere and quality food makes for a restaurant you should definitely visit when in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "A spot you can't really stumble upon without some prior planning, since it has no sign and is anonymously tucked behind a tiny entryway (copper doors with bars). So its pretty appropriate that you would need to do some research before arriving. Beyond just finding the place, you ought to be prepared (mentally, physically) and strategic about ordering.   My takeaways: The real draw are the appetizers here, which on their own are enough to feed a hungry crowd. 5 of us were stuffed after sharing two seriously awesome appetizers: The queso is swimming with fresh spinach and spicy pork sausage, and the garlic appetizer was a meal unto its own with garlic roasted to a smooth pulp, meant to be spread on bread and smothered with the platters-worth of roasted veggies, onions and melted cheese. Then comes the rest of the food, each person's order served basically on a similarly humongous tray lined with a toasted tortilla, and then loaded up with PILES of whatever the dish entailed, e.g. seemingly the whole side of a pig, lovingly braised but far too much for one person to even look at, plus a pint of beans, and equal amount of rice, eggs, potatoes, more tortilla, etc.  Whether you choose to prepare yourself accordingly, know this: no matter what you will probably still trundle away in a happy food coma for the next several hours.",

    "text": "Most amazing brunch i've ever had. There was a couple here who said best in AZ and they have been coming here for 20+ years.   Well they started us off on high expectations and DH delivered. Delivered completely.   The bartender/server here was very friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. Like the ins and outs of the menu. We asked for some recommendations and he said anything with the carne adovada is great. This was True.  My wife got the carne adovada benedict. I got the rellenos and eggs with red and green sauce. both of these dishes were amazing. My rellenos were/are perfect eggs were cooked amazingly. We watched the chef prepare our dishes and wow it was filled with anticipation of: \"is that what i ordered? that looks soo good\".  The carne adovada, like the server said was amazing. It was tender, delicious and delicious and delicious. I don't know how else to describe it. The meat was juicy, not dried out which lots of places have dry meat. the Egg to the benedict was perfect and runny. I've had some benedicts recently where they served it basically soft boiled and swear thats how its supposed to be.  Also the hollandaise was delicious. it was a perfect fit on this benedict. Really well made, even smooth texture. Yet  still rich (which is what you want).  This place is DARK! so older people be aware and sit somewhere with a light so you can see your menu. The room with the tables would be best for more lighting. I loved how dark it was. It really gave the place an old time feel. When you walk in your hit with a burst of a nice smokey smell from their wood fire grill. There is the bartop with a few high tops to sit at as well.  The backroom has three large tables which could accomodate a group of people. Definitely not a child friendly place if it was to be packed. I am not sure how crowded it gets, but by the taste of their brunch I am sure they get really packed. We went on a Thursday morning and there were only a handful of people there. It was a little bit busier by the time we left.   My recommendation. Sit at the bar/hightop area, its a better experience. Ask the server for his/her recommendations. sit back and relax.",

Going there on a Sunday early afternoon with a couple buddies, I was eager to see what this place was all about.    I'm pretty sure Jimmy Hoffa's body is easier to locate than this place, but once you do find it you're in for a treat.    It's small, but luckily we were able to get an open table right away.  The beer selection could be better, but I wasnt complaining.  I ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito with red chili sauce which was great in size and taste.  For only $5, was a gonga of a deal.    Highly recommend so get over there now!",

My favorite is the chile rellenos (duck and pork with green sauce), although my boyfriend gets something different every time and is never disappointed.  The chiles are always spicy which I LOVE because nothing is ever spicy to me and this is one of the few places that has been able to make me reach for a glass of water.   It's a cozy place that almost reminds me of the inside of a hunting cabin that's been decorated up for fine dining.  They have a decent selection of wines and other bar items.  As far as seating goes, expect to wait for a bit unless you get lucky because it's a tiny \"dining room\".   All I can say is, \"Go eat there!\"  It's really amazing food and a really unique atmosphere.  Definitely worth the hunt.",

    "text": "I'm already craving Dick's Hideaway...and I had it less than a week ago!   The wait'll probably be long cuz this place is tiny, but it's so worth it. The ambience is kind of rustic but cool and the clientele is friendly, and you can always grab a drink while you're waiting. I tried the prickly pear margarita, which was just sweet enough and had a nice salty kick to it.   You'll expend your recommended caloric intake for the month, but it's so worth it.I had a special platter that included a mushroom tamale, smoked turkey relleno, carne adovado burrito and rice and beans. It easily could've fed three, but it was so delicious that I wanted it all for myself. Each item had a wonderful spicy kick to it, and my faves were the smoked turkey relleno (a lighter take on its cheese-filled cousin, and ten times more flavorful) and the carne adovado (tender pork studding a meaty, hearty sauce). I even liked the beans...and I HATE beans!   You'll ingest all kinds of carcinogens, but it's so worth it. I had some bites of the special mixed grill, which featured pork loin, steak and lamb chops. Each piece of meat was of good quality and was expertly prepared -- the lean yet juicy pork loin was my surprise favorite of the night. I never thought you could get an excellent burrito and excellent grilled meat in one place, but Dick's proved me wrong!  You'll start pheening for it as soon as you leave the parking lot, but it's so worth it. I would totally drive myself to LAX in traffic, buy a ticket to Phoenix, wait in the security line, sit through a flight, rent a car and drive to Dick's right now to have it for dinner...cuz it's SO WORTH IT!",

We did take out and were glad when we some the small, crowded and warm interior.  It was dark and very tight.  Which is fine if that's your thing!  As a vegetarian, my options were limited, but that has never stopped me before.  I ordered the mushroom tamales.  They might be good with a different sauce, but apparently there are two options: meat, and really freaking spicy.  I couldn't even eat it.  It wasn't the tastes-good-underneath-the-pain kind of spicy, it tasted like some spice (paprika?) that just tasted like crap and pain.  I rarely dislike food, and almost never don't eat things, but those tamales were not happening.    We also ordered an order of toasted garlic, which was really, really good.  It came with way more bread than we could hope to eat.  Seriously amazing sauce, vegetables, garlic and I don't know what all else.    My boyfriend got the tomatillo toast, which sounded and looked amazing.  He said it was delicious, and we both want to give this place another try.  I am just staying far, far away from anything red and or spicy.",

I chose the place because of the high reviews, unique menu and late kitchen hours, and it did NOT disappoint. HUGE portion sizes. Shared a queso, tomatillo toast and I think a relleno platter. My fave was the queso. The ambiance was fantastic, there was even a huge private room that made me wish I lived in the area so I could have a big birthday bash here. Recommend!",

    "text": "We decided to try this place out after reading all the great brunch reviews. The food was great- we had the Tenderloin Benedict and Carne Avodaba (sp?) Benedict. Both were great. I will say I'm not a big meat and potatoes person and there weren't many options I wanted, but I did enjoy the dish I had even though it wasn't what I typically would order. Anyway, the food was good and the service was okay. Our waitress was super nice but the food took about an hour to come out, which was annoying.   The weird part was, I had to go to the bathroom, which was located inside the kitchen- they only have one bathroom and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it. So, I was walking back and I see and hear the owner literally full-on rage screaming at a group of employees. He was walking toward the same end of the kitchen I was going to and he was yelling \"NOBODY F*CKING LISTENS TO ME!\" Literally veins popping out of his neck and yelling SO loud. He definitely saw me and I felt super uncomfortable because of how loud and aggressively he was yelling at these workers. I felt so bad for them.   Anyway, the end of the meal comes and our waitress informs us the owner has taken care of our food and drinks. She doesn't give us a reason why- I mean, obviously it was because I saw him behaving that way. It would have been okay if he had come out and apologized, said he was taking care of our food, etc. but he did not make an appearance outside of the kitchen for the rest of the time we were there. So, it feels like he tried to pay us off or something- just a sketchy vibe. We won't be back- I definitely am not going to support a business where the owner treats his employees that way.",

She says she got let go, and misses all of her regulars etc.. not surprising, she was super busy and waiting on a lot of people.  So, no need to go back there.  I don't think I could tell you the name of a manager or owner, I certainly wouldn't recognize them, but I sure do know the people that made that place great, can't imagine who would let a bunch of them go.

They didn't steer me wrong on this one.    Hidden in the middle of plain sight;  This is the place.   We tried the happy hour menu.   Really good food,  and a selection of spirits that would appeal to any taste.      The New Mexican Con Queso was on point as an appetizer.  Even the house tacos were good.   The food was great.    It was an indication of what they'd bring out as an entree.      I don't get the vibe that dicks is trying to the appeal to the masses;   they're just trying to appeal to the right person.     I'm a fan.   I'll be back.",

    "text": "I have to give a poor review for Dick's this last time we went and it's sad given the last two times we went to Rokerij and enjoyed our time there. First some of the positive notes of our dining experience:   Good happy hour with 6 dollar good wine pours that were very generous.   Good ambiance and mood in that it's not overly loud so you can hear your company.   Nice seating area in the partition of the restaurant where you can have a large group gathering or be in a half circle booth of four guests amidst adobe style walls and lit candles.   The calamari is always excellent (minus the sweet and sour which doesn't complement) and prob one of the best I've had in Arizona.   The wait staff is responsive and friendly.   Then the reason for my less positive review is...we had really bad stomach issues after last eating there. We weren't sure what we had but we suspect it was the red chili pork sliders that weren't on the menu but that the waiter recommended (which were quite expensive by the way ) when we asked for a recommendation for something with NM red chili. They weren't particularly spicy but they were way too salty and lacked much other distinct flavor. We didn't event finish all three sliders but think we had bad pork or else something that was dirty because we had a horrible evening and morning.   While the waiter was nice he seemed a bit detached or distracted from the experience and didn't seem all too confident on making a recommendation when we asked. Nor was very informative when asked other questions about the wine and spirits.   We knew about the menu and the steep prices from being at Rokerij but before we never really tried any of the main dishes or meats and this time we had hoped to be wowed by something with red chili or green chili but unfortunately we are now very wary of going back.",

The tenderloin and brie toast points are so darn delicious too.  So many brunch items and the portion are as amazing as the taste.  That speaks volumes in my book!",

The restaurant is pretty small and all I saw were couples there. I was with family and we felt a bit out of place so maybe take a date here.  The restrooms are straight down all the way in the back of the restaurant. The restaurant feels more like a hallway then anything else.  There are funny signs and sayings throughout so have fun looking for them, one is, \"No Kardashians Allowed.\"  As for the food, fantastic! We ordered the Pasta Heidi which was al dente linguine with grilled chicken and a very generous amount of chipotle cream sauce. I asked the waiter if this was owned by Rokerij since I remember them having the same signature coyote and he said Richardson's which is right next to Rokerij owns Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway. I also asked if they share the same menu and he said Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway actually serve the same dishes but Rokerij has a unique menu.  You can also rent half of the restaurant for an event just make sure to call ahead of time to reserve it.  Neat place for a date. Dim, almost dark with just candle light. A cute little spot.",

We came in at around 4pm on a Saturday, the place had this dark moody lighting which would have been nice for an intimate setting but most of the seating was cramped or communal. The candles situated through out the establishment were a lovely touch but the bombardment of flies and gnats took away from the mood they created.  We were basically told to sit wherever we could find seating so ended up sitting in the back near a large group who were uncomfortably sitting in an L shaped booth which allowed almost zero communication between them.  Serves didnt really seem to have established tables, as we were served by three different people during our visit. All were nice is a bit flustered. We both ordered local beers they had on tap which were nice and cold and the food came out hot but thats about all I could say of it.  For $15 a plate, we definitely expected more. The food ranged from bland and tasteless to just unappealing, even for New Mexican style dishes I expected more. The insects wanted our plates more than we did. We ended up barely eating half our plates and just throwing the rest away.  I would say this place could be nice to stop in for a drink and a small meal, as we saw a couple clearly enjoying their date. And apparently their steak is quite good from what a fellow patron said. But all in all we will not be returning.",

Love that their hours, opened at 7am bright and early serving their usual lunch/dinner menu and their awesome breakfast plates til 4pm. Food is always spectacular. Tastes as good as it smells. It's awesome to see the cooks cook/prepare your meal in front of you if you choose to dine at the bar. Pricey, but the portion sizes are substantial and you do get what you pay for in terms of quality and taste. Big selection on wines too. My only complaint is that the serving staff/bartenders are very warm and chatty with regulars, which I don't mind or think that's a bad thing. It's just that people who frequent the place will see delays in service such as wait longer for requests or even for their check. I'm never in a rush when I come here simply its expected. Which that itself is not a good thing.",

Luckily we arrived at a good time and did not have to wait.   Ordered the shrimp app and stuffed jalepeno app.  Beware the jalepeno is spicy!! The shrimp was very good.    Where it went South was the fact that none of us ate what we originally ordered.  My husband and I shared the Chile Relleno.  It's definitely on the greasy side.  You get a choice of green or red sauce.  Our waitress did not warn us that the red sauce very spicy.  Had we known we would have stuck to green sauce.  You get choice of two so I ordered the cheese and my husband ordered the beef.  My mother and sister n law also shared the chile relleno.  One got duck and the other got Pork.  I do not eat meat.  When we first received our meals, my mother n law asked the waitress if she had the wrong meal because hers just had cheese inside.  The waitress insisted that there was meat inside it was just surrounded by the cheese.  The waitress while nice, was overly cocky in the sense that we were wrong and she was right.  Finally my mother n law told her, there is no meat in hers.  I then noticed that there was meat at the end of mine.  I had been picking just the cheese and thought that the meat was a spillover from my fiances.  The waitress argued back and forth with me that what I was eating was the beef.  I know what beef looks like.  Either way the fact is she mixed up our meals.  Regardless, I had been eating the duck, my fiance the pork, and my mother n law had no meat.  No one was eating what they had ordered! The one most mortified was myself as I do not eat duck or pork EVER! The waitress apologized and asked if she could get us a new order. At this point we had eaten enough and had all lost our appetites.  Our entire meal was all trying to figure out who had what because nothing looked right.     Pretty disappointing that the waitress did nothing to compensate our meal, we paid over $100 full price for all meals we did not order nor wanted.   We don't plan on returning again.",

Although this place is extremely small and hidden, it's conveniently located on Bethany home Road and 16th St. - Dicks hideaway offers an authentic New Mexican dining experience.   Last night was a business function for 23 guests. I was amazed they all found their way to this restaurant. Immediately upon opening the front door, there was another secret door to the right. That was our private room. Nicely decorated with copper table tops and old wine bottles as decoration,  our room was small but extremely comfortable. We even had our own  private lavatory.    We ordered up some appetizers and the staff served the group beer, wine and cocktails to get this function going.Foodies in the group appreciated the fresh bold flavors of New Mexican appetizers. The main course platters were huge. I had the pork chop stuffed with chorizo sausage.  It was served on a bed of assorted vegetables. Even for the large group, there were numerous choices of sumptuous entrees on the menu. The staff and our server get a 10 out of 10 rating. Outstanding! The woman that served us knew our names and our drinks and she made the group feel like we were her personal friends - or even better yet, guests in her home.  For attentive service in an intimate setting with high quality New Mexican cuisine, this is a wonderful secret spot for a unique group dinner event - a  total hit!  Salute!",

The Roasted Garlic Plate was ginormous, for $16.00, It will definitely feed a large party. For our little party of three, it was too much, it actually filled me up, and I couldn't eat my dinner. No self control when it comes to yummy roasted elephant garlic, cheesy roasted peppers, and grilled bread! It was delicious. I asked our waiter for a side of balsamic, he nodded, and I never saw him again, until he delivered our entree's, another miss by our waiter. We also ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeno, it was awesome, but be aware it's spicy, which I love, so that was a good thing, however if you're not a spice lover, this one is HOT!  I ordered the Burger, it looked delicious, I seriously couldn't take one bite, the appetizers did me in. My hubby got the Sandia Chicken, the chicken was great, but the green chili linguini that accompanied the dish, was not good. It tasted like raw flour and had s weird texture. My son order the garlic shrimp pasta, he enjoyed it, but the pasta was off in this dish too. For $31.00, it could be a lot better.  We didn't order wine this evening, but their wine list is phenomenal! On our way out, we saw a glimpse of the dining area with the wine cellar, it would of been nice to sit in there!  I will most likely be back, especially for the appetizers and wine!, I'm still put off with the service, and being seated next to a loud party, in the upper level, the sitting arrangement is a bit tight and awkward. With the \"steakhouse\" menu prices, I was hoping for better service and dining experience.",

It was awkward since we kept telling them how good this place is.   Th waitress mixed up our orders before. We didn't think it was a big deal. However, today was a new record of how rude she was.",

It is small, dark and cozy inside...with some of the most amazing southwest and New Mexico style food. They have a full bar, happy hour food and drink specials, and open late! I always get the New Mexico Enchiladas, and the Carne Adovada. INCREDIBLE! Their red and green sauce are to die for! Daily specials also available...just check the board. I can't say enough good things about it. Give it a try and you'll see what I mean. The place is small, so get there early, and parking is ample...located in a small strip mall. See you there! :-)",

I had salmon with the awesome mix of asparagus, corn and wonderful sauce.  It was so delicious.  The platter had tons of asparagus, and the salmon portion was large, so no skimping here!  I will definitely go back when in town.  Tiny place, but packs a punch!  I went here with some friends on a Sat night and somehow the wait was only about 15 mins??  There is really no place to wait, so we stood in the doorway and had our drinks.  It worked out.  Anyway, the menu was mostly seafood and there were tons of specials for the evening.   Ambiance is on the dark side and pretty loud.",

When you walk in, a waft of smoked meat hits you. You see the grill, the full prohibition style bar, the huge bar level bucket of ice containing bottles of beer, it was a lot to take in.   The food--excellent. It was hardy, large portions, perfect for taking men out for brunch and having them feel full. It's a meat-driven menu, but there is a lot of options including scrambled eggs and pancakes for the less adventurous. Definitely a locals only spot we infiltrated.   We sat at the bar since there were only 4 tables in the bar area, which only improved the experience. We talked with the owner, saw the meat turn and met strangers over mimosas. Great joint.",

(You can look at the menu in all good time, but trust me just order the roasted garlic plate as soon as you sit down. It's amazing!)  I've moved out of the neighborhood, so now this is a rare treat reserved for when I'm in the area. Oh happy day! A meeting in the general proximity so I called in a lunch order. George is an expected part of my visits, so seeing him felt like everything was right in the world. :) I grab my to go order, cruise the 20 minutes back to my office just to find my much anticipated Chimayo Chicken with a green chili pepper are no where to be found. I am sure maybe the Sante Fe chicken is amazing fresh from the kitchen, But by the time I had it, it was cold fries and broken hollandaise. That's hard to come back from. Everything there is amazing so if you like sort of a plain Jane menu pick, I bet this is totally an acceptable option.  Feeling bad for calling at 12:15 (and apologizing for the terrible timing) but worse about my lack of lunch satisfaction I let them know there was a mix up and that I'm in no position to come back. The gal on the phone said the order got rung in correctly but the kitchen made it wrong. She was super apologetic and said they'd waive the charge on my card. So while I'm still bummed because that Chimayo chicken is so amazing, and I'm totally jonesing for it, they tried to do what they could. I thought maybe an offer of a free desert to entice me to come back was the most I could expect (assuming they even have desert?). I'll be back, baby! Thanks for handling it so graciously. I would also recommend any of their salad specials, Tomatillo Toast, Eggs Benedict, turkey relleno and carne adovada. Some think their food is hot, I think it's just right. :) Their wine by the glass is fantastically priced for the selection they offer.  Mmm did you remember about the garlic plate??",

I could write an encyclopedia raving about this place, but I'll let you all be the judge of that.  Instead, I'll list a few things of importance (to me), and therefore probably should be to you as well:  - It smells really good in here. As in, you will leave the place smelling like cedar and smoked meat, and want to eat your own arm  - Get anything with adovada...the meat that's marinated in this stuff sits forever and, stewed up, makes me want to cry   - Vic's meatloaf with green and red chili  - Fantastic Bloody Mary's and a shot of ale to balance it out (it's got a kick)",

Loved them both for different flavors.  Hubby had huevos rancheros.  Also excellent.  I ordered a Bloody Mary which was seasoned perfectly and it came with a beer back which I've never had before but they fit together perfectly.  We came back the next day for happy hour (7 days a week) and had the small plates.  Very tasty and easy on the wallet.  The bartenders are very nice, make you feel welcome and take care of your every need.  This  place is not for everyone.  It really is hidden away ( no exterior sign).  Inside is dark and kinda seedy looking but I think it adds to its charm.  On second thought, don't go here.  I want to make sure there's room for me on the bar stool.",

Our server (short blonde lady) treated us like we never exusted.  Took our order...i ordered a diet coke and burrito with no beans...she gave me regular coke and my burrito was floating in beans.  I was dying of thirst but no one ever came to ask if i needed a refill.  She didnt come back to our table until she probably saw we were done with our food!  By then, you can barely appreciate the food youre eating and ruins your impression of this place rated at 4.5 stars. Place is pretty pricey for burritos and enchiladas...i dont mind the price...willing to pay for more if the service and if pehaps the food was to my taste...we still gave her 20% tip but please, fire that lady.  I just wrote a review on tripadvisor and read obe other comment where customer also complained about nothing else but the service!",

    "text": "I will start this review by saying the name is very appropriate. This place is hidden. There is no sign on anything. After circling the parking lot a few times we finally called and we found it it was right next to the ace harware. As we walked in, I was instantly impressed. A very small spot where the bar doubles as the kitchen. The wood fired grill makes the whole place smell good and gives it the cozy vibe. They play great music, make strong drinks and have amazing food. I have ordered a bunch of different items and they all are great. I reccomend going with enchiladas  or pretty much anything on the menu. Beware though as the food always comes out extremely hot. Also, get there early as this place is tiny and fills up fast. The food is worth the wait for sure though. It also appears that they have a pretty good happy hour.",

The \"Pasta Heidi\" is a dish that will likely NEVER be knocked from my \"top 10 favorite foods list\".  It is MY-OH-MY GOOD!  The ambiance is absolute perfection.  Rustic yet polished.

    "text": "I gave this place 2 stars here's why service WAS HORRIBLE. It was our first time here and I can say I'm not impressed. Our waiter was not personable at all. He didn't great us with a smile or even tell us his name. I felt like he was miserable and did not want to be here. We also felt very rushed when ordering. We asked about the chile because there is a \"caution\"on the menu pertaining to how hot it is. All he said was \"what ever you prefer\" didn't even mention the taste or how spicy they were.... Once we order we never saw him again. He walked by us Numerous times never asked us how anything was or even if we needed anything (which we did) We had to ask two other servers for drinks and our check. The place was nice very different decor. Just a bunch of random pictures all over and stuff. We sat in the bar area so I can't speak for the dinning area. The food was good but I wasn't blown away by it. The portions are huge here. Which is something I don't really like personally. I feel like it's just a waste of food (and also part of the reason why Americans are so obese. Definitely no reason for any place to give huge portion sizes... Sorry about my personal note hehe) it's also very dark in this place when I walked out side I was blinded by the sun like. (Bugs life: \"don't look into the light!!!\"). The orange juice was my favorite part about this place. It was great fresh squeezed! Anyways we won't be going back to this place.",

I always always always get the Carne Adovada (in one of the pictures on Yelp) with over easy eggs, yummy beans, and potatoes. I recommend getting it with their blue corn tortillas, super yummy.

Vic's Green Chile Meatloaf and Eggs. The meatloaf was ok, but she said she wished she had ordered Rellenos or the Carne Adovada instead, and she raved about the jalapeno hollandaise and the tenderness of the beef tenderloin that the perfect eggs Benedict sat upon (I always share). Still loved the ambiance and the service was lovely.",

    "text": "It took me a while finding Dick's Hideaway.  It's nestled between some smaller businesses across the way from a strip mall, and I didn't see a sign over the door until I decided to get out of the car and find it on foot.  The doors were nothing fancy, and there wasn't an outdoor menu to check out, but I later figured after I had eaten my meal that if Dick's cared to advertise, there'd ultimately be lines down the block of people waiting for a seat at their three tables, or their bar.  Whether waiting for the good drinks, the cozy atmosphere, the amazing food, the kind service, or a chance to watch your meal being made over a fresh draught beer, there'd be people waiting.  I am thankful that Dick's is such a hard place to find, and even happier knowing it's certainly worth the search.  Dick's menu is strictly American.  Good American.  They only have one burger stowed away on three menu pages bristling with bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, roasted chicken and cheese steak sandwiches.  Just one burger, and yet I'd not want another to take the place of every other delicious option you'll find.  In fact, if there's anything wrong with the menu at Dick's, it's that there are too many amazing plates to choose from.  I ended up having half my drink before I found what I wanted, but the service was quick, attentive, and ready when I pointed out the cheese steak and watched it made fresh.  Sure, there are only three tables.  You can order food at the bar, if you're lucky enough to score a stool.  But I can't dock Dick a star for being a hard-to-get treat.  If there were more tables it'd feel too big.  It'd be louder, full of people who take the place for granted.  No, Dick -- keep it small.  It's quaint, personable, and OHMYGOD delicious.  If I was made to wait half an hour for a chance to enjoy a meal at Dick's, it'd be well worth it.",

This place has a great meatloaf and eggs, and their take on eggs Benedict is awesome - the pork is like Canadian bacon on steroids.  Not literally on steroids, I am sure it is free range pig - but really thick, lean slices of good pork.  Add a bloody Mary, and you truly have the breakfast of champions.  Or at least breakfast for someone with a mild hangover that wants to get the day going.  Happy hour is also great, I think they still run the $5 wine specials and a free appetizer is sometimes served at the bar top.  Overall one of my favorite bars in the area.",

I know they reopened after burning down a few years ago, and I've been looking forward to the garlic plate for a long time.  Turns out Richardson's was about 3-4 blocks up on 16th street, not at the corner in the strip where it used to be.  We ended up just going into Dick's, since it's all owned by the same family.  And parking is tough there, we didn't want to move from the parking spot we were lucky enough to score!  I've never been inside before but it was perfect for us, very cozy and intimate.  We were just stopping in for a light lunch on our way to our staycation.  We got the half garlic plate and the skewers.  It's not a lot of food but oh my God, how delicious it is.  I wish we got the full garlic plate.  The elephant cloves were smooth and creamy and the perfect base to the peppers and cheese that we piled on to our baguette bread slices.  The skewers were delish--they came with a shrimp, a sausage, a beef and a chicken (I think?) and the salsas and sauces all complemented them very well.  Not a cheap place but very much worth it for a special occasion.",

The staff was very efficient with managing the Sunday after St Paddy's day brunch crowd and ensuring everyone was being taken care of as soon as possible.  The french toast was toasty and cooked perfectly with the faint hint of cinnamon that kept you wanting just one more bite when you knew you should have just taken the leftovers home.  My girlfriend got the french toast and a cup of coffee which she was given before we even were able to get a seat at the bar.   The staff made sure the water and coffees were always full, really a nice job.   I got a well made bloody as it seemed fit to have such a drink on Mar 18th at 9 am.  The combo of jalapeno Benedict, two chicken enchiladas and perfectly cooked asparagus were a treat as well and I would love to go back again tomorrow if I could but have to leave town so until next time DH.....keep up the good work and keep this place hidden!",

I had some delicious Enchiladas for dinner and a Mexican Meatloaf for brunch.  Both came with rice and beans.  I honestly don't remember either dish tasting differently from each other.  That's sometimes my problem with Mexican food.  Far too often, it all tastes exactly the same.  The beans were also over cooked.  This is not to say that both meals weren't filling or tasty, but I am hesitant to go back because I know I can get equally tasty and filling meals for 6 dollars less.  That being said, the small interior is very intimate and would make a great place to take a date.",

I was Yelping around on Saturday morning looking for somewhere to eat in AZ that wasn't a chain. Challenging task, I know. I needed something that reminded me of home. Something with character and culture. This is when my prayers were answered and I stumbled upon rave reviews of this adequately named establishment. Chile Adovada on their brunch menu? Surely I wasn't in Scottsdale anymore... this sounded like heaven to me! I could hardly contain my excitement when we finally entered this humble abode of brunch delight! At last- I found a joint that didn't resemble a Denny's or Ihop. I was delighted to say the very least. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and I of course had to get the Chile Adovada. It was pure bliss. The plate was large enough to feed 2 but I was starving. Every bite was out of this world! I could talk about the food for hours but let me move on to the ambiance. It was about as cool as the food. I felt like I was part of a club or something of that nature. There are no signs on the door advertising the place so it felt a little secretive. Pretty cool huh! The staff was super friendly and inviting. I topped off my weekend brunch with a small glass of jalapeno infused tequila. Careful if you don't like spicy flavors! If you like heat as much I do though, you will love it!  I will definitely be back at Dick's again soon!  Ciao!",

We were informed by the bar tender that the owners' policy was NOT to let customers take \"Small Plate\" leftovers home to keep patrons from trying to dine on the cheap!  I could see his point if we had only ordered $15 bucks worth of food and a glass of water- but we dropped more than $50 bucks on drinks alone!  Either way- what's the difference?  You would rather throw food away than keep a customer.  So long Dick's and Richardson's and Rokerj!",

I had the prime rib, and it was so salty and overly spicy that I just skipped it and focused on the side dishes (vegies were good).  My husband had the scallop salad.  He said it was good, but 4 scallops wasn't enough for a main dish.  We also had guacamole - which was fine, but nothing special.  Twice we ordered drinks that never arrived as well.

Once you walk in it is dark which is actually a good thing as the windows are covered to keep the hot Arizona sun out. The food I must say was delicious and plenty. I had the carne adovada Benedict which comes with beans and your choice of potatoes or hash browns. My wife had the French toast with bacon and three eggs--ALL GOOD! I also had the Bloody Mary which is kept seeing everyone say how good it was and they were not kidding, it even comes with a side car of Stella Jalisco beer. My wife had the mimosa which she says was also very good. If you're ever in the area coming here is a must.",

    "text": "We thoroughly enjoyed this place! It's a bit pricey, but worth every dime of it! The first time we set-out to go to this place for dinner, we drove around the block 3 times using our navigation and we didn't see it so we gave up. This time we asked neighboring shops and at our second stop, we were guided through their kitchen to the back alley to a random door that looked like a storage closet from outside and mind you, it had no signage on it. And then you enter through the kitchen of Dick's Hideaway as if it's the norm to be directed to a very dark dungeony cave-like dining room. How on earth would even the above average patron find this place??? But I guess that's the concept, hence \"Dick's Hideaway.\"  After such a voyage, I needed to wash my hands, so I was pointed to the bathroom, or should I say \"washroom.\" Never in America have I seen a shower in the restaurant patron's bathroom... until now. I dared my daughter to take a shower but since there was no towel, she opted out.  On to the food. The menu is very southwest (in a good way). We ordered the special of the day, fish trio (smoked salmon, swordfish and mahi) with grilled veggies and hollandaise, 3 enchiladas (pork, beef and smoked turkey), and the garlic butter pasta with grilled chicken for the kiddo. As a cook, I can appreciate all of the freshest ingredients used from the farm fresh grilled veggies to the homemade hollandaise sauce to the fresh made tortillas and mole to my daughter's amazing noodles, which I'd gamble that they are home-made. They have a nice selection of specialty brews, fine wines and their libations are made with fresh fruits and puree which were very tasty and pricey. But my mom always says, you get what you pay for.",

    "text": "This little hole in the wall has a great menu! My favorite dish is their Pork Pulled Enchiladas, red. 3 in the order made with blue corn tortillas fresh made salsa to top them. The nice thing about the sauce is, it's not saturated with cumino or ajo (cumin or garlic) which commonly masks the taste of the chile California. The pork was a little dry this time but other times it has been very moist. They are loaded with cheese and paired with frijoles de la olla ( beans from the clay pot) very authentic. The rice I will always pass! It's uncle bens rice not good and tastes very instant. The cook could have taken the time to saute the meat before placing them on the plate but as he was prepping my food in front of me I noticed that the enchiladas are pre-rolled....hmm  maybe his is not a good idea since r meat dries up.   Service here is consistent, nothing over the top but consistent is always good. Drinks here are way too pricey I would go for drinks somewhere else. I recommend this place if your in the mood for some good enchiladas! It's worth the stop.",

I love the fact that its located in a very unassuming strip center with absolutely no signage and its always very busy.

When I saw Luci's, I parked, then we walked along the strip mall until we found Dick's Hideaway.  The previous review wasn't kidding - there's NO SIGN on this place.  They do have a bulletin board with a menu posted though, so you know that's the place when you walk up to the door.  Loved the decorations - liquor bottle, cactus, liquor bottle, cactus, liquor bottle, cactus, liquor bottle, cactus, bowling ball, sewing machine.  It works, right?  The random signs they have posted on the door and around the bar are pretty funny, too.  It was pretty clear we were the only non-locals in the place.  There was no room at the bar.  Everyone who walked in or out the door said hello or goodbye to the staff by name.  The place was pretty small but we didn't have to wait for a table at 8 a.m. on a Thursday.  The coffee was very good.  I had the carne adovada benedict and it was excellent.  My wife had the heuvos rancheros with green chili sauce.  She thought it was too spicy.  I thought it was excellent.  Service was a little slow, but quality takes time.  My only minor annoyance was they served the table next to us before they served us, and we had been there a good 5 minutes before them, but then they were locals who knew the names of the staff.  The menu looked awesome.  I'd love to go back there and eat every meal during this weekend getaway to Phoenix with my wife, but she would like for us to branch out and try something different.  :-)",

I've turned on lots of new people to this rustic place that used to be the overflow for Richardson's before the original restaurant burnt down and moved a half mile north with another fav - the Rokerij. Dick's has great Santa Fe cuisine. My weaknesses are their blackened scallops and grilled shrimp. The bartenders and cooks are always friendly. They added a room in the back that I never see except to cut through to get to the rest room because I like being in the bar area with the knotty wood high tops. Dick's has a private dining room. A US Presidential motorcade was out front one night for that group. Not the current President. There's no sign saying the name of the bar/restaurant outside. Which somehow makes you feel like you're getting to experience something cooler and not just commercial. Just look for the wood no name doors. The owner, Richardson Browne III, has always been a rebel and goes to his own tune. A tune you'll love if you like good food and good ambiance at Bethany Home and 12th Street just north of Luci's in the strip mall. If you're this person, you will thank me. You'll thank yourself. ;-)",

It was a special occasion, my FIL's birthday and though the traditional wasn't present, this was its own unique type of special experience. This gem of a restaurant serves top-notch New Mexican-style cuisine and I don't put that lightly. Every single bite was a 10/10.  I ordered the Carne adovada Benedict with smoked pork that's been long-simmered in a deeply earthy red carne adovada. Hash browns extra crispy and beans. All swimming in red sauce, delicious! It stole the show and for great reason. If your a local and haven't tried this place (like myself) do yourself a favor and go! You won't regret a thing.",

If there is a wait, don't be tempted to leave and find something else.  Wait it out.  You will be rewarded for your patience with delicious food.  These are tight quarters.  You will be very familiar with your neighbors.  I love sitting at the bar the most but honestly, take any spot you can.  The service is awesome-- you will be taken care of where ever you end up.  So if you are about that green chile life, you will love this place.  Their eggs benedict is the best but during this visit, I opted to share the stew topped with overeasy eggs which was glorious.  They don't mess around with heat.  I'm already planning my next outing, that's how good it is.",

For whatever reason, m companion read or heard from his friend that this place was recommended..so he wanted to check it out. The place was a bit hard to find...the sign was difficult to notice at night and if I remembered it right, it was in a strip mall ish area.  The place was packed and popular. When we arrived without reservation, we were lucky because it was already a bit late at night...and the table we got in the back of the restaurant just so happen to open up because someone was leaving.  We ordered 2 dishes (roasted giant garlic and meat mix), a drink (soda for me and a cocktail for my companion). The dishes were aggregiously huge...there's no way you can finish it. The taste was just ok. Til these days I'm still not sure if we ordered the right dishes that give this restaurant the rating we saw. I look across our table...none of the people could finish their dish either. To me, the restaurant charges a lot per each dish because it's large..not necessary because of the taste. I just felt like the food was a bit of a waste here.  Overall, ok and a popular place for people to stop by for sure. But for me..I wasn't sure if I would go back again on my own given just ok taste..and an unnecesaarily large portion.",

We got two great seats at the bar and ordered happy hour cocktails. We also ordered off the lunch menu and was very impressed with the food. The portions are HUGE. You can definitely share a plate! This place was fun and cozy and we will come back, for sure.",

    "text": "Went here for Happy hour on a Saturday. First off, the \"famous\" onion rings are likely famous due to coming with an assortment of salsa based sauces. None of which compliment an onion ring. The rings themselves aren't very good either. Luckily they had jalapeno ranch which made them edible.  The adovada sliders were pretty good, but not an immense amount of flavor.   The final nail in the coffin was a captain and coke was $9 for a short. It wasn't on happy hour, but still. This isn't the kind of place that should charge more than $6 for this drink on any given day.  The funny part was the receipt listed the captain for $8 and then an additional $1 for the coke???    I really had high hopes but this place was a bust.",

No trouble finding them, just look for the address over the door. Love the atmosphere. Not hipster, but kind of retro cool cavern. Seated in the only booth in an enclave, were served by our very nice young lady. Without meaning to be overly picky, will describe our meals for you, the readers, pleasure. Wanted to try everything , so started with skewer appetizer. 2 skewers of a  cube of chicken, beef , and a small shrimp, on a quesadilla covered in beans and rice, a little cheese. Chicken, tasty, beef good, shrimp over grilled, tough and rubbery. Beans and rice, fine. For the meal, had the rellenos and eggs, Terry the tamales and eggs. We traded off , to sample everything. Rellenos, large, plenty of meat inside, tasty and filling.  Tamales, same. Pretty good. Hashbrowns were really good, lots of crunch. Ordered eggs over easy, they were a bit overdone to medium. Salsas very good, heat level appropriate. Service very nice and attentive all through the meal.  Not crowded for this Tuesday lunch, took our time. No rushing. Finally had leftovers boxed  to go. Enough left for dinner and breakfast! So... Comfortable, cool atmosphere, good service, pretty good food. Great place to enjoy a 69 th  birthday, with a good old friend. If I knew I was going to live this long, I'd have taken more care along the way!!! I recommend this place, just for the fun of it.",

The home style potatoes are delicious but so we're the hashbrowns. Boyfriend got meatloaf and eggs with red and green chili. He's a spice wimp so wasn't loving it (both chili sauces have heat but I personally wouldn't  call either one \"spicy\" however I really love spicy food and found the heat to be subtle and delicious). I liked his dish but mine was mind blowing.  Busy place.  Cool atmosphere - dark and mysterious. No sign out front - a True \"hideaway\".   Loved it!",

    "text": "I FINALLY made it in to Dick's Hideaway! I have been to their sister restaurant, Richardson's (and love it) so have been meaning to make it in to Dick's forever!   As you drive up, it is tough to find because they don't have a sign, SO you enter at the door to the right of Luci's main entrance. They don't take reservations and seats are limited so weekends may have a wait but on a Tuesday night, we were a-ok! We sat at their community table and had a lovely experience. The ambiance is dark and cozy. The room that we were in was lined with dusty wine bottles, making it feel so 'old world'. It can also be a bit loud so if you're looking for a quiet place to dine, this may not be your spot. It probably isn't the best for large parties unless you reserve one of their rooms ahead of time. I'd say keep it to 2-4 people, MAYBE 6 if you sit at their community table.  For food, we started with their roasted garlic appetizer and it was SO MUCH MORE than I expected! It had giant roasted garlic cloves, with peppers, cheese, and a yummy sauce to put over the top of crostinis. It was a DREAM and a must order if you're in need of an app. Heck, it could probably even be a meal.  For my entree, I got their seafood linguine and it came with a side salad. Their side salad is the same as Richardson's and it is my FAV! It comes on an ice cold plate with lettuce, thick shredded cheddar, green onions, diced peppers, and the tastiest jalapeno ranch dressing. I love an ice cold salad! The pasta was also amazing - it had 2 large shrimps, 2 jumbo scallops, linguine, tomatoes, spinach, and parm in a thin white wine + butter sauce. It was pretty rich and after the amazing app + salad, I definitely brought some home! Entree price points are on average $20+.   My only complaint was that our service wasn't the most attentive but we still had a great time. I'll be back!",

I parked right outside, and I ended up walking around to Luci's Healthy Market Place and the Koller True Value Hardware store before I found out it was right in between both of them. There's an unmarked door that's open.  When you walk in, you're in the hallway between the bar and the dining area. No one paid attention to me, even when a bartender walked right by to deliver food. I ended up walking over to the dining area and stood around until a server noticed me and said I could sit anywhere.  Decor is interesting. Dusty wine racks filled with wine everywhere. The tables are very large, especially the one with the TV. It seats about 10 people, so you'll have other people sitting at the table where you're dining.  1.

Hell, I even cut up and ate the tortilla on the bottom of the plate as it had soaked up all that great adovado sauce.  It costs more than normal but I received fair value for the buck.

    "text": "This place was recommended to us, and it took a bit to find it (had to ask at the hardware store - they must get that a lot!).  But it was worth the hunt.  The breakfast dishes just blew me away.  We were in town for a week and went back twice, and try to hit it every time we hit town.  The carne adovada is probably my favorite, although I've had most of the breakfast plates and haven't had a bad one yet.  The best part is the bottom tortilla that soaks up all the flavors from the plate, and is a nice finish to the meal.  The black beans were great, not drowning in sauce like too many places do these days.  The benedict dishes were also great.    Last time in town, we went there for dinner (first time).  Also great!  Spicy but not over powering, terrific selection of meats and sides to choose from.  The appetizers were excellent, good selection of spicy and non-spicy (not everyone likes it as hot as I do).  Definitely worth a return to sample more of the dinner menu  This is quickly becoming one of my \"must visit\" places in the Phoenix area.  Easy to to get to, but finding parking can be a challenge at times.",

    "text": "By far my favorite meal in Scottsdale/Phoenix this past weekend.  If you don't want the back-story just skip to the bottom paragraph for how the food is...  My hockey team had a tourney this past weekend in Scottsdale/Phoenix area and my girlfriend and I are referred to as \"Yelp snobs\" by family and friends.  After an extremely long night of drinking, dancing and hot tubs, I woke up with a huge appetite.  My girlfriend and I had been eating healthy-ish all weekend and I wanted a ton of carbs.  I read the reviews about this place and decided we needed to go.  We drove about 10 miles to get here, which seemed far at the time but really wasn't. ha  When we arrived the first thing we noticed was that the only sign they have is a sign that basically states unattended children shouldn't be here. AWESOME!  We walk in and there is a little bit of a line, so I assume there will be a wait.  Nope the busser/host immediately started sitting everyone in line.  He took us to a large table in a room filled with wine shelves all over.  It was a family style table that seats 8 with about 3 people sitting down.  We took a seat next to a regular who gave us great incite on this place as well as some of the inside jokes that are on the menu... Mary Patty's Special.  Just saying sometimes the people you meet can make the experience a thousand times better.  If we hadn't meet James we still would have truly enjoyed Dick's.  Service - I hardly ever saw my waiter.  He came every now and then but didn't seem to interested in our table... however the busser is another story.  He honestly kept me full of coffee and water the entire time.  He was such a mover I honestly want him to work at my restaurant if I owned one.  This guy definitely made me think about my waiter in a bad way because of how good he was... I really really hope that they tip the busser out well because he is the one I wish I handed my bill to after the meal was over.  Just stellar service.   Now on to the food.  My girlfriend ordered huevos rancheros with over easy eggs and green sauce and I ordered breakfast enchiladas, over easy eggs and green sauce.  Both of these meals came with a LARGE side of beans (spicy and tasty) and a good breakfast potato.  When I saw the size of my plate my eyes lit up.  My girlfriend and I spent about an hour and a half eating our brunch.  When we both decided we were done we still had about a 1/3 of the plate leftover.  Since we didn't have a fridge at the hotel we decided we shouldn't take home the leftovers... It was the hardest decision I have ever made.  When I come back next year to Scottsdale for the hockey tourney I will be coming back to Dick's Hideaway and ordering some thing else on the menu.  I really hope the busser is there and he has been promoted to server.  Great place and highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I love this hole-in-the-wall (literally)!  I was in Phoenix for a conference, and had some downtime to explore the local neighborhood. The hotel staff from the Hilton at Squaw Valley were kind enough to provide me some transportation to and from this location since it was within two miles from the hotel. But naturally, I had chosen this little gem because of the awesome reviews on Yelp. I'm glad I was not steered wrong!  The first thing that caught my eye was the door. There isn't a sign on top indicating it's Dick's... instead you have to just know you're stumbling through the right door. Immediately as I entered, I could smell the delicious hints of roasted meat. I quickly found myself a seat at the bar. Dick's Hideaway is small. The max capacity of the entire room must be around 20.   There were maybe four or five tables, and then the rest were bar seats. Fortunately there was a seat left for me.   I started off with a local craft beer: the Prescott Amber Ale. Mildly delicious. A good pair with meat.   My main meal? The New Mexico Burger: an all angus medium rare beef patty, New Mexico hatch green chile underneath a cheddar cheese layer---all in-between two local buns and with a side of handcut fries.  Yum! My burger cravings were being satisfied!   Alright. So this isn't necessarily the best burger I've had, but this was definitely flavorful and hit the spot. Overall, everything was well worth the price and the trip over. I would definitely recommend this little restaurant if you're looking to dine in by yourself or with a small group.",

The food is always delicious. I've never been disappointed. It is a little pricey, but I've never left feeling as though I didn't get my money's worth. I honestly have no idea how they do it. There is constantly people filing in, but they're always on top of food and drinks. I've never had poor service or bad food here. If you get the chance, stop in. You will not regret it.",

When we walked in it was a bit confusing because there's no obvious host stand so we wandered through to the dining room but decided to sit in the bar area. We were greeted shortly after we sat down and given waters and menus. The bar area is very dim but the dining area is well lit so depending on the occasion you'll want to choose accordingly. I ordered the Meatloaf Benedict, my husband ordered the chicken quesadilla and my little sister ordered a burrito (I forget which meat). I was not a huge fan of the Benedict because the meatloaf wasn't very flavorful. I'm a sucker for all things Benedict so I thought I'd give it a try. I ended up thoroughly enjoying my husband's and my sister's meal, lol.  I also ordered a regular margarita and it was great, definitely one of the best I've had, my husband tried it and he agreed. The menu looks fantastic and I'll definitely try something different next time.   p.s. The plates are scorching hot, be careful!!!!",

Don't expect authentic Mexican but come with an open mind that you will indulge in good tasting dishes.  Aside the main entree, what stood out to me were their rice and beans.  They were cooked al dente and full of flavor.  The grains were firm but not hard.  On my last visit with Fia R and Daniel L (first timers), I ordered their red tamales.  It wasn't the best I had but it was on a decent level.  I came here once for a CMYE and I had one of the enchilada dishes and it was melty good.  The cheese was like molting lava all over the dish which screamed: \"eat me now.\"  All their dishes come on these cool, silvery industrial looking iron plates ensuring your dishes will remain hot while you get down and dirty.  The only caveat would be that its a compact place--you have the main bar and the couple of tables by it (seats 4).  To that, there's a more spacious dining room for larger parties, but probably needs a reservation.  You will find the decor appealing due to its dimly, dark setting like you went into hiding.  The lighting and furnishing were all high-end looking, no less.  If you are craving some Tex-Mex in the central PHX area, this is the spot to get some.  They purposely try to be a \"hidden gem.\" :-p",

    "text": "I'm sorry but no. Subpar. I just don't get the rave reviews.  After trying to get in on a busy Saturday night, we stopped in a week later midafternoon. It can be easy to miss, but keep a look out for a small menu posted outside by the front door. Inside, you grab whatever seat is available, so you're either at the bar or seated at one of a few different large community tables.  We had the carne adovado sliders as an appetizer. They were OK, nothing outstanding or special. I had the chicken burrito with green chile sauce, and my husband had the taos club.  The chicken in the burrito was very dry. I didn't get a lot of flavor, either, aside from salt and tons of cheese. The rice was dry and tasted a little burnt. I liked the beans, but I wanted more green chile sauce and more flavor out of the entire meal.  The taos club was pretty good. The avocado was a little hard and not distributed evenly in the club, so one bite was full of one ingredient and another bite was full of something else. The accompanying salad and fries were nice, but again, we just didn't see the ooh and ahh that everyone else has seemed to experience.  Portions were large, but prices were high to match. I just was not impressed. Small restaurant with awkward seating, food that is average at best, and expensive prices for what you get. I won't be back.",

    "text": "Dick's is as good as it gets for breakfast, brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner, or reverse happy hour.. Basically, for everything!  The Bloody Marys are made in house, and the homemade red chile is definitely a part of it, as they are SPICY! Not really into bloody's, but still want to try one? Get it in a short glass, that way the vodka:mix ratio is better and you can still enjoy a yummy drink! Wine, mimosas and bloodys are $5 until 5:30 every single day, and man can they add up! It is just so intimate and cozy, you never want to leave the place!  My favorite dish for brunch is the Richardon's Combo, which consists of a pork benedict, asparagus and two chicken enchiladas. I like to swap my enchiladas out for turkey or shrimp, but they're all yummy! For dinner I either go with the Pinenut Crusted Seabass (seasonal) or the Dick's Surf & Turf. The Surf & Turf is a 6oz filet topped with 2 bacon wrapped shrimp alongside chorizo and bean flat enchiladas. SO GOOD. If I wasn't on a juice cleanse right now, I would have already called in my order to go.   The only dessert option is flan, and.. well.. its flan. I don't know, you be the judge!  FYI- It is called Dick's Hideaway because it is HIDDEN. It is located on the northwest corner of 16th street and Bethany Home Road, inbetween the hardware store and Lucy's. It does not have a sign. Please, please, do not read this review and then call the restaurant to ask where they are located. These are ample directions!",

Their specials menu always has the most delicious items on it, like the NY Strip with fresh crab, hollandaise (which was amazing, normally I find this sauce lacking), and spicy chipotle sauce.  Well worth the money, for sure.  Most of the specials items are a little pricey (and well worth it!), so if you're looking for a less expensive alternative, go with the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer, as it's only about $15 and is definitely a full meal.    Be careful with the garlic appetizer.  While it's OUTSTANDING, the next day may be a little...windy. ;)  The wine list is great - several selections, and many are moderately priced (especially their happy hour specials).  And they have a good draft beer selection.    The service is always spot on.  The place is SUPER TINY and intimate, which I love, but also means that you need to walk in with a good attitude, knowing that you might need to wait a bit for a spot at the bar or one of the three little tables.  There is also a private room you can reserve, I believe, for dining with a bigger party.",

The food at Dick's Hideaway is on par with the very best in Santa Fe. All of the dishes are made from scratch. I don't think there is anything in that kitchen that has ever seen a can. Every time I eat there I don't wanna brush my teeth for a few days so I can lick my chops and relive the  whole thing all over again.

I ordered the adovado benedict but was really disappointed.  The pork wasnt that spicy like it promised,  very little hollandaise, way too much pork and the english muffin was super burnt - it was so burnt I could smell it and see it through the dark adovado sauce.  I kind of wonder if they knew the sauce would cover it and were too lazy to re-toast another one.  Unfortunately the waiter didn't come back for a good twenty minutes so I just ate a little of the pork and eggs.  Nothing about this was good, probably because it was just a heaping pile of pork with way too much sauce and all the other flavors were accents.    I tried my friends \"Heidi Pasta\", which was good but kind of bland.  Had potential though!    Overall, I think this place might be good and I just got a bad dish.  No, I got an absolutely disgusting dish.  Maybe it was the cook, maybe it was my taste... Who knows.  I was really pissed I paid $14 for like 5 bites though.    I wouldn't be back unless someone else is paying, I still have a bad taste in my mouth.  :-(",

    "text": "I'd like to say this is one of Phoenix's best kept secrets, but with almost 350 reviews, I'm the one late to this party! I'm sure I wasn't the first one to have trouble finding the place. I was parked directly in front for what felt like 5 minutes before I realized that the dark door with no sign was the entrance to Dick's. Once inside, the seating was limited to 10-12 bar stools and 4 tables - The other side of the restaurant was closed to a private party. I have no qualms with limited seating, and in this case was worth the 15 minute wait.  Once seated, service was decent enough, however I could tell that they had a lot going on our waiter also doing bartender duty. The menu was extensive with a moderate sized nightly-menu and about a dozen items on their special board. I ordered the Carne Adovada and was able to sample one of the special menu items, the Seafood Trio (I can't recall the exact name).   The last time I had Carne Adovada was over at Carlsbad Tavern in Scottsdale. Comparably, the one at Dick's was far above and beyond. The meat was tender, the spices complimentary and not too overpowering, and the sauce -- well, it was knock-me-off-the-chair spicy. They do forewarn you on the menu of this, so I can't knock any points off for it. It was enjoyable, my stomach just wishes I had gotten the sauce on the side.  The Seafood Trio came with Salmon, Mahi, and Swordfish, each with a different sauce. The Mahi and Salmon were pretty well cooked, although the Swordfish was a little too dry - Which might have had to do more with the quality of the fish than the cooking duration. For me, one of the highlights was an inventive (but certainly not fancy) side dish with creamed corn, asparagus, and brocolini. Off the cusp, it might sound a little off, but the combination of sweetness of the corn worked well with the greener vegetables.  Of the 'New Mexican' restaurants I've been to in the Phoenix area, this is certainly one of the better ones, if not the best. In comparison to the also good Carlsbad Tavern, I would personally recommend Dick's.",

    "text": "Add this to the list of 1 star reviews on account of bad customer service. The issue: I have been trying all week to make a reservation for 15 people for lunch on Thursday. I made no fewer than 10-15 calls to all 3 restaurants and 4 different numbers; left messages for all the managers; visited twice; spoke to possibly 10 different people altogether; at one point, seemingly, got on someone's nerves because I was calling too often (even though I wasn't getting calls back as I was told I would); even texted someone I was told to text. Not one response. A classic case of everyone passing the buck and nobody wanting to make a decision. All for what? To buy the place? No. Of course not. To make a reservation for 15 for lunch. Why? Because a lunch here is my brother's bachelor party wish between hiking Piestewa in the morning and playing ultimate frisbee in the afternoon. When I walked in there at lunch last Thursday, the place was dead. Not a living in soul in the side room or the back room. Maybe 2 customers in the main room. But making a reservation to bring 15 people and maybe $1,000 in lunchtime revenue here the following Thursday is tougher than buying the place. Seriously, I have bought and sold businesses more efficiently than trying to make a reservation at this place! Maybe the people prefer sitting around on their smart phones than serving good, paying customers. So I called O.H.S.O. and had a reservation in a under minute. Sad. I'll change my review in the future if something changes, but nothing I've seen suggests that these people care in the slightest, possibly because of being managed by another restaurant in a different location.",

Today I got the Carne Adovada Benedict.  It was awesome!  Only complaint (minor) is that my hash browns were slightly undercooked.   I'd requested extra crispy, but it was definitely not the end of the world as I still loved my meal.   My husband had the Chicken Burrito which was also good but I could tell it wasn't his favorite item from Dick's.  Good to know for next time :)  Ambience = We sat in the back room behind the bar area this time.  It seemed like a nice idea at the time but there was another patron there who was literally laying down in the booth on the phone talking business for a few minutes.   It was even more awkward when she randomly got up and insisted that she and her other guest (who had not arrived, yet) were going to sit at the formal dining table for larger parties.  The staff handled the situation professionally and gracefully, though.  Next time I'll prefer to sit where we normally do (in the more lively bar area).  It's tighter in there, but it just feels right for a wonderful spot like Dick's.",

    "text": "The food was OK. The French toast that we went there for was soggy, a disappointing experience for sure, given the high praise the French toast was given in the Phoenix New Times article \"Top 10 Places For French Toast\" (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phoenixnewtimes.com%2Frestaurants%2F10-best-french-toasts-in-metro-phoenix-6550117&s=43e94e060f7ff16856b14144f8bb45b570da2f1669a87297e02a7afb663b4858\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phoenixnewtimes.com/rest...</a>)... It smelt delicious coming out, but the dazzle of smell set a high bar for something so lackluster in texture. The flavor was on point, but texture is a huge part of French toast, just like French fries. Nobody wants soggy French fries... Nobody wants soggy French toast. 2 stars.. Has potential to be great, given the right cooking technique.   I had the jalapeno eggs Benedict, which was 4 star...  Very good, crispy edged English muffin, thick ham, and perfectly poached eggs... The jalapeno hollandaise sauce was fantastic, probably the best I've had. The potatoes were a bit under cooked, it seemed. Just a tad on the raw side... I was expecting something with a bit of crispness on the outside with less raw potato flavor on the inside, and more baked or fried potato flavor.  Now onto the worst part, which really tipped the scales for my girlfriend and I... It was this woman at the bar... This place is only about 12 feet wide and 30 feet long... This lady was loud enough for every person in a 30 yard radius of any venue to hear her personal affairs if she was talking and laughing at the same volume in a larger, packed establishment... I felt bad. She ruined our lunch. There were only 7 patrons in the building and 3 staff, and \"never been married, never gonna get married, never gonna have kids, only have one cat\" bar lady was absolutely destroying the experience. 5 anti-stars!!!! The only reason I'm not counting this as part of the review is because it's not the establishment's fault... The workers there seemed to be talking to her in their best quiet voices but she was just rampagingly obnoxious with her voice. I guess alcohol can have that effect, but lady, it's 2 in the afternoon... Seek help, not attention.   We will go back another time when the environment is equally loud (probably in the evening) so the background noise is white noise, not conversation killing. And we'll order something more oriented toward their dinner menu, which the hens over open flame rotisserie looked delicious. Once we do that, I'll update the review based on our shared experience.   Until then, try Dick's, just don't get the French toast.",

Do you find it annoying when people write reviews but don't tell you what they actually ate? I do. But I'm about to be one of those people. Doh!

On with the food, it was great.  I started with the Posole soup, which was rich in pork, spicy and definitely filling.  The soup is served on top of a tortilla which was a great addition.  I didn't have too much knowing I still had my main course ahead.  The cabbage and radish were great neutralizers of the spice.  For the main dish, I had the Pork Chop Chorizo.  The pork chop was tender, juicy and well prepared.  The mango chutney sauce added complimented the pork very well.  Not much to say about the chorizo between the two slabs of chop.  I only went directly for the chorizo by itself once, because it tasted better in conjunction with the pork itself.  The side of veggies were grilled to perfection.  I totally forgot what the green chile potato (GCP) was and boy did I miss it.  I didn't finish it, but thoroughly enjoyed it as I was eating it.",

    "text": "This place is hard for me to understand let alone review. So I decided to go in the middle with three stars. I'm only going to touch briefly on the food. It's not really the reason I wanted to review this.  Get ready for a rambling of mixed feelings.  Some friends took me here on a Wednesday night around 7 PM. They have been here before and had nothing but good things to say about it. If they hadn't driven I don't know if I would have been able to find it. There isn't a sign above the door. I later found out this is on purpose. We walked in and the first thing I noticed was the small space and dim lighting. My friend explained to me that if you see a table then you take it. Otherwise you have to sit at the bar or wait for a table to open up. There aren't a lot of them, and the last one was taken by the party they walked in before us. So we ended up sitting at the bar. I don't mind bar seating though. Some places I actually prefer it and this seems like it would be one of them.  The bartender was very polite and attentive. He answered all of our questions and even offered samples of beer we were asking about. We split some kind of queso dip with spinach and chorizo in it. I was enjoying it a lot until I got a bite of something super spicy and I had to stop for a few minutes. I'm not exaggerating, it was painfully spicy. And not even the good kind of spicy; burning pain kind of spicy. I ordered a burger for my entree. It was a spiced burger with bacon, barbecue sauce, avocado, and a huge hunk of cheese. It was such a thick slice of cheese that it didn't even melt all the way through. I picked off the unmelted chunks and took my first bite. I cringed as the taste of burnt food filled my mouth. After closer inspection I discovered it was the bacon. It tasted like the residue from all the other food that had been cooked in that spot on the cooktop. So burnt bacon and unmelted cheese aside, the actual burger was just ok. It was seasoned nicely and not to greasy, but there was nothing extraordinary about it. I honestly expected more after all the hype from my friends and the bartender. The fries were delicious and crispy, but not a lot of places can screw up fries. My friends got meat skewers and a pasta dish. I didn't try either dish but they looked and smelled good. So the food was fine. Here comes the rant.   I am always looking for a place that offers great costumer service. When I go to a restaurant I'm paying for not just a meal, but the staff that's making me feel like a valued guest. This place is adorable and trendy. It feels kind of like you're walking into an exclusive club where only the cool people can eat. I love that part if it. However I don't love the sense of pretentiousness that this place has. I was told they have a policy where they can turn away anyone with a less than totally understanding attitude. In a way this is beneficial to help keep the assholes away, but at the same time it's a service industry. They must be doing well enough that they don't care if people leave and never want to come back. They also don't split checks, and don't split plates. I feel that these are easy enough accommodations that should be made for your paying guests. I just didn't feel like a valued customer here. It felt more like they were just waiting for me to leave so that they can fill my seat with a regular that is going to drink all night.   I think this is the thing that bothered me the most. One of the most important experiences in a restaurant is the service. If people don't get good service they don't want to return. The food wasn't good enough to outweigh the pretentious aura. I don't think I'll be returning.",

    "text": "I literally made 3 u-turns on 16th st looking for Dick's. Hey, I'm in Phoenix. Why wouldn't I go looking for it? Found it! Park your car, bruja, and come get some (ehem) Dick's. There it was - hiding away like a timid little...there I go again! Okay, I'll stop.   When you see it, you'll know it. It's that bold. Dick's has a shtick. The quirky signs on the door are your first impression that you're in for a potentially fun, casual Mexi-American-Southwestern dining and drinking experience that pokes (pause for laughs) fun at itself. Then you walk in and you realize that this place is the real deal. The hard wood (wink) bar runs from front to back with a decent amount of seating space to belly up for a drink or you have high tables to stool it for larger groups. There's also a dining room that I didn't venture into but seems to be somewhat roomy given the size of the place.   Anyway, I digress. Upon walking in, you're immediately smacked in the face with the smell of Dick's. (Wait. What? Was that grammatically correct? Maybe, it's Dick's smell?) The fire burning grill is right behind the bar and gives the place an amazing charm, smell, and feel that only deliciously cooked food can offer, which brings me to the New Mexican Surf & Turf. Since you've already gotten a smack to the face, try a smack to the palate. Typically, the dish is made with a Beef Tenderloin but I asked for a NY Strip substitute and they complied. It was amazing and full of flavor from spicy to tangy to peppery to beefy and meaty. The char on Dick's steak was perfect and the smokiness of the shrimp was outrageous. The two together made a party in my mouth.   There's also the added bonus of enchiladas smothered in red chile sauce or liquid fire, whichever term you prefer, and I believe the infamous green chile potato, which is chile flavored mash nestled inside of a large green chile. It was awesome but now I need a fire hydrant because my belly is on fire. In the end, I was happy after eating Dick's (jeez!).  To top it off, the drink menu is impressive, boasting a creative list that True mixologists would envy. My spicy Mexi-twisted Old Fashion complimented my S&T perfectly. Thanks to Dick's I can taste again! This place is a must try for any former resident / tourist, like me, looking for elevated Southwestern fare.",

The happy hour is from the time they open to 6:00 pm and then it starts again at 9:00 pm. Well drinks, which includes Titos vodka, is only $5.00 and all juices are fresh squeezed. The bartenders also don't skimp on their pours. If you are in the mood to have a couple of drinks, you aren't going to go wrong with this place.   While the dish I ordered was a little heavy for me, the flavors were bold provided a definite kick. Unless you are ravished, I suggest splitting your meal because the portions are huge! Know that a $5.00 splitting fee is charged, but if you order a side of meat or the amazing chili stuffed potato you can avoid that fee for a slight up charge.   Overall, this place has it all! Good food, great drinks, and excellent service! I will be back for sure.  Saturday 11/05 @ 9:00 am",

Once you open the door it couldn't be more obvious, but there are few clues from the outside of what's contained within.   The first room is narrow, a crowded bar and a couple tables. My girlfriend and I opted to squeeze into the former, and ordered a couple beers while we browsed the menu place mats. I ordered the huevos rancheros with eggs, and she had the jalapeno eggs Benedict.   Our food was served on metal plates that had been sitting on the grill, and were thus quite hot. We both received ample portions, ensuring the taking home of leftovers. The carne adovada was delicious, though cooked in a different way than I'm used to in New Mexico, with a smokier flavor reminiscent of certain briskets. The eggs, beans and hashbrowns ensured I got my fill of flavor and texture combinations.   My girlfriend enjoyed her food as well, almost gratuitously laden with toppings and featuring thick cut ham that cut no corners. While the prices here are not necessarily cheap, it could be a wise idea to split a plate of food. I wouldn't mind coming back here; next time I'll actually know where it is.",

I did not have the foresight to read Yelp beforehand and drove around three times before realizing that I kept passing the restaurant. Luckily, we found parking right in front and there were two empty seats at the bar. While you wait for food you can read the entertaining signs and admire the eclectic decor. I ordered the Carne Adovada & Eggs with hash browns and eggs cooked over easy. It came out on a piping hot metal plate and smelled delicious. The portion is huge and could have easily fed both of us. It tasted good but nothing amazing. But I am still glad I got to hunt down this fun restaurant.",

I was a little disappointed in that Dick's really didn't stand out that much in my mind.  It's good, yes.  I had some breakfast enchiladas topped with a fried egg, which were incredibly spicy (seems to be the theme here) but weren't anything that much different than enchiladas that I could purchase at any other breakfast/brunch place in town.  The only thing that was really different was the fact that the price is substantially higher here.  The atmosphere is fun - this place is hard to find (maybe that's why it's called Hideaway?) and feels secluded.  However, I'm not sure that I'm willing to pay the increased price tag for the exclusivity.",

    "text": "The Meal Never Came  My wife and I are in town for a short vacation. Heard great things about this place and you can't get this kind of food back home in Cincinnati. We came in around 815 and we were given the option of sitting at the bar or a table in the back room.   We decided to sit at the bar and enjoyed watching all the great looking food come out while we waited. I had the old fashioned to drink, which was great but just a little sweeter than I prefer. I ordered my next one without the simple syrup and they were happy to make the adjustment for me.   I ordered the enchiladas and my wife ordered the Chimayo chicken. After about 60 minutes of waiting and noticing the guys on the line beginning to prep the grill to close we asked about our orders. They had put them on hold, gotten busy and forgotten about it.   The staff was friendly and very apologetic after they realized what had happened. They were nice enough to not charges us for my two drinks and my wife's club soda. However, we never got to eat and by the time we left around 1045 most everything else we closed. All the food looked and smelled amazing but I'm not sure if that made things better or worse for us.",

First of all, Dick's used to be the secret speakeasy -no signage- brother to Richardson's (prior to the fire and relocation). The bar is a single counter with a few tables. Now the back room is a much larger space that can house a meeting, party or over flow tables.  For those unfamiliar with the menu: Dick's provides amazing authentic New Mexican food. The chile (despite the warning label) isn't too spicy. When I need my fix on green Chile, I always head over.   Favorites: green chile potatoes, smoked turkey enchiladas and the fresh fish of the day (which there is an abundance of specials).   Note: Red chile is much spicier than the green chile- but typically you should order based on your preference.",

As usual the place was crowded (at 10 in the morning) so we sat at the bar (my favorite place)  I ordered carne adovada with scrambled eggs.  The adovado was rich and hot but no so hot to overwhelm the taste buds,  the eggs are nice complement to allow your taste buds to cool off before the next bite of the tender carne adovada.  if you can't get to new mexico any time Dick's Hideaway is a great place to get the red or green chili fix.",

The place itself is nicely decorated.  I love the open grill at the bar, and the smell of burning wood.  We ordered a couple martinis, gimlets, beer, and actual food.  The drinks were nice  and strong, the bartender has a heavy hand!  The food was delicious.  I got the carne adovada which was just perfect.  The pork was so easy to pull apart.  And who doesn't love a meal where you don't need a knife?  That means less effort put into eating.  My friend got the skewers and enjoyed them as well.  The presentation for them is a little nicer than the adovada, which is just meat thrown on a plate. The bartender was great, asking us what music we wanted to hear on Pandora.  He still needs to watch The Hangover so he can understand why my friend needs to stay in Caesar's Palace in Vegas.  We just might have to stop in and see him tonight.  Word to the wise: be careful about getting drunk at the bar.  The bar stools are wobbly and I can see someone eating shit while wasted.",

For group dinners, Dick's Hideaway has a private room (often called the 'family room' in many traditional New Mexico restaurants) that will seat close to 20 people I think - an excellent place for small business dinners.

It's hardly visible with the darkened doorway and there's really no space to wait.  We arrived for brunch and they were packed.   When we finally got seated, I was so excited to order the poached eggs rancheros.  My friend had the Carne Adovada, which had eggs, smoked pork, and potatoes and beans.  The waitstaff was so overly busy that it was hard to get a cup of coffee or even place our order.  We were seated at the bar and so I was able to watch them cook.  While they were juggling a bunch of dishes, I did notice that the cook put the eggs in to \"poach\" and left them forever.  Of course, when I got my meal, the eggs were so overcooked, they weren't even edible.  I would have returned the dish, but couldn't get any waitstaff's attention.  So, I ate the sides and some of my friend's food, which was excellent.  When it was finally time to get the check, I informed the waiter of my breakfast disaster and he simply shrugged his shoulders and took away the plate.  So much for good service.  And, is the name of this place a euphemism for a certain part of women's anatomy, or is that just my sick mind?",

    "text": "This review is strictly written based on the fact we ate at Dick's Hideaway for our wedding reception dinner and utilized the private dining. Being from Ohio we realized it was very very difficult to get responses back from the staff, and we also seemed to have multiple contacts over the planning time when exchanging emails. We tried leaving  a few messages, and we did have a little better results then, however they did call us at 4 am one time...yes 4 am! When we got into the private room and seated there is also a private bathroom for the group however soon after someone from the bar walked right in and used it. I immediately asked our server about it and got some quick attitude from her on me asking to lock the door to not let them in....I mean we did put $500 down just to have the room so I think we deserved the right to call the shots! After that we heard the waitress yell out to the bar not to use the bathroom saying \"She just got yelled at, and doesnt like to be yelled at\"...yes we did hear you Michelle! Then we also noticed a sign on the door saying....Private Party Stay the \"F\" Out....dont know if they were trying to \"take a dig at us\" but we thought it was pretty funny and had the entire wedding party sign it and it will soon be framed here at our house as a momento.  However, the food was TRULY AMAZING!! and HUGE portions which had everyone giving compliments both during and after the dinner. Would I be back...absolutely! What would I tell future wedding goers....to be persistent...they can make it great...BUT its alot of work!!  5 stars for food...but heavily waited on service and common courtesy",

Came in recently with some of my work friends for brunch, and needless to say I most definitely plan to return!! I had the tenderloin benedict, flavorful and juicy! And loved their mimosas! My other two friends ordered the jalapeno eggs benedict and the other had the huevos rancheros,both were raving about their dishes as well. My only question was, why the hell did I wait so long to eat here?! Especially when I live so close!!",

    "text": "This was an interesting dinner.  First, it was little bit of a pain in the ass to find, there isn't a big sign on top of the building, just small print on their glass door, but once we found it, it got even more fun, well, kind of.  The server was casual and down to earth, a little too casual.  He was pretty slow to bring out the drinks, and he told us, in his words, that he was \"too busy\" to read us the specials, so he dropped off his handwritten notes to our table and left for a while.  This was a little mind boggling since we were the only table in the dining area, and there were 2 people at the bar... But what I did appreciate from our server was his brutal honesty, my friend asked about the tamales, and he was really quick to say that it usually turns our dry, and that we shouldn't get it (she got it anyways and liked it).    I got the Richardson Combo (eggs benedict, asparagus and 2 chicken enchiladas), weird combo right? But they blended together really well as I ate them.  I thought the food was great, they had a garlic infused hollandaise sauce on the eggs benny and the asparagus, and the enchiladas were quite tasty.  I had little bites of other dishes my friends had, and they were all really good, especially this one pork dish, I don't remember its name, but it was a slow braised pork, and it was amazing!   This place lost a lot of points because the server made a douchy move.  After we ordered, he asked if we wanted to start with any chips and salsa, him just asking I assumed they charged for it, but I didn't see it on the menu, so there was the possibility they don't charge for it, but we said yes anyways, and he asked if we wanted guac too, and we said sure (again, nowhere on the menu).  Chips and salsa were $5.50 and the guac was $6, what the hell!?!?! $11.50 for that! UGH!! It wasn't even that good!      To sum this up, amazing food (so amazing that it still gets a 4/5 after this terrible experience), not so great service.",

I don't like leftovers and I NEVER ask for a box.  But these were still amazing.  We're going again this weekend because I've been craving it all week.  The only bad part of the evening was when we asked for 2 tortillas, since the meal only came with 1.  They charged us $2 for them?  Talk about  nickle and diming a customer.  $2 for a cheap, store bought tortilla from Fry's.  That really bugged.  They lost a star for that.",

If you didn't know it was there, you'd have a very hard time finding the place (especially for out-of-towners like me).   This is a hip little tex-mex place with awesome food and a surprisingly beautiful wine selection. I went on one of those 20 person business dinners and we had a blast. Service was stellar and the food was outstanding!  I had the blackened scallop quesadilla with shrimp and New Mexico sausage, rice and cowboy beans on the side (it was OUTSTANDING!). Everyone at the table was raving about their selections, so apparently everything is great.   The servers had a vast knowledge of wine and were quick and attentive. Did I mention that the restroom was through the kitchen??? Hilarious place! Check it out if you're near!",

    "text": "We have been coming to Dicks for eight or nine years now, ever since a tourist from Vermont that we met in Sedona mentioned it to us.  We were complaining we couldn't find any decent New Mexican style food (being from New Mexico) and he told us of Dick's.  With that said, we tried it and loved everything.... until....  .... the last few years, we have been receiving COLD food.  The plates are extremely hot to the point you literally can't touch them for about 10 minutes and the food on the outside of the plates can't be tasted during that time... but the food in the middle of the plates, cool to actually frozen on many occasions.  We have a friend we brought a few years ago and in addition to his order being forgotten and then rushed, it came out cold.  He won't go back.  (We keep trying to change his mind!) This has happened another time when we brought family to check out our favorite restaurant.  Something is going on with this fantastic diamond in the rough..... cold food?  We went last night and it was not that busy so no idea why the rush to get the food out.  Typically 20 minutes from order our food was brought and yep.. cold.  I only hope our friends we brought to introduce them to our new favorite place didn't have cold food as well.  I only hope the managers see this review and check into their cooking/heating systems of the prior prepared food..... last night was the NM Combo plate with a burro replaced for the shrimp, the burros were cold.  Mine was Relleno Platter with an egg on top and well... the middle of the relleno was not warm.",

Maps said that I had arrived but I could not see a sign or anything but this place does not try to pop in your face and just has these doors and is basically unmarked. But don't be shocked or assume that this place sucks, because you are in for a treat! The food was DELICIOUS! I love the options and the portions were gigantic! The mimosas were also spectacular! I would definitely recommend people to come check this place out, but the only thing you need to prepare for is the wait! It was packed last time I came here and we were squeezed so tight in the doorway waiting to be seated, but it was worth every second! Go and check this place out! Don't blink for another second and just go! :D",

Based on the reviews here, I ordered the Bloody Mary and Carne Adovada Benedict. The Bloody Mary was attractively presented and delicious but so infernally HOT that my tastebuds were too numb to taste the food for awhile! I love how they cook meat over a wood grill and the pork was very tender and flavorful with a texture like that of beef brisket or pot roast, but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers here that the Carne Adovada was so heavily covered in hot red sauce that it completely overpowered the flavor of the pork and the eggs. Bottom line: When you go there, order food that is not heavily sauced, ask for the Bloody Mary MILD at first (you can always make it hotter)  and I'll bet you'll have a better experience than me. Very friendly attentive service and dark chill atmosphere.",

My husband are light eaters...especially at dinner. We had intended on just ordering the Carne Adovada. However, when we got there and grabbed the tiny two top facing the wall(the place is small), I noticed the menu noted \"ABSOLUTELY no split plates\". Did they mean they won't split a plate in the kitchen or we couldn't share a dish? When I asked the server, I was told that they would charge us $5 if we chose to share. Some restaurants charge for split plates because soup or salad come with the main course. That certainly was not the case here. So, we chose to order the Skewers to avoid the ridiculous sharing charge. The portions are insane. And because we are staying at a resort, it's not like we can take leftovers for tomorrow. In hindsight, we should've paid the $5 fee, shared the one dish. The Carne Adovada was tasty. The skewers were terribly boring, bland, and the poor shrimp were over cooked. There's plenty of better food in Phoenix/Scottsdale so I'm a bit confused over their high yelp rating. For me, it was an OK meal but not even close to mind-blowingly good or worth the price.",

Hands down the best huevos rancheros (overeasy, red & green) you can get, not just in Phoenix, probably the entire western US. I can't remember the last time I've come here and ordered something else. I've had the jalapeno eggs benedict, too, and they're incredible -- not as much heat in the hollandaise as I'd like, but my tastes run spicier. My wife got the tenderloin benedict, which I tried and was very tasty.   They have free wifi, nice cocktail servings (the mimosas and Bloody Mary are very generous), homemade chile sauce, and the coffee is above average.

Dick's is about half bar / half restaurant.  I would have preferred a nice comfy booth in the dining room, but we didn't like how the dining room was so small and isolated so we sat at a high top table in the bar area.  There's a nice selection of beers on tap and the food menu is pretty expansive.  Start with the garlic plate and don't plan on being hungry for much more after that.    The New Mexican Chicken was fine but was not a particularly distinctive dish and didn't exactly remind me of New Mexico.  The red, white, and blue enchiladas had more character but they were covered in so much cheese that you couldn't tell where one began and the other ended, much less figure out which enchilada was which until you were halfway through eating it.    If I'm being too negative about the food, maybe it's because I was already full from the garlic plate.  Or maybe we just didn't order the right things.  Either way, I would come back here.  The cozy New Mexican-style atmosphere is fantastic and they have some decent happy hour specials.",

And there's good reason for that. Service was quick and attentive. My partner-in-dine ordered the \"Tenderloin Benedict\" which had two grilled tenderloin fillets served on English muffins, topped with two poached eggs smothered in jalapeno hollandaise with potatoes and hash browns. I went for the \"New Mexico Enchiladas\". For my three enchiladas, I chose the green chile pork, grilled shrimp and beef. My enchiladas came with rice and beans and I chose a combination of the red and green chile. I also added two eggs on top of my enchiladas. The food was delicious, hearty and had the perfect degree of spiciness. We also ordered the Bloody Mary which was Bloody Good! We also loved the laid-back and cozy atmosphere. According to my esteemed partner-in-dine, \"It was a 'happy tummy' experience!\"",

My only complaint is the occasional \"cool\" server who isn't all about customer service-- but that only happened once!!",

She however, didn't listen to any of the words out of my nor husbands mouths and nodded her head , and said that's excellent..as though it was rehearsed ... and left the table. It was as though she didn't HEAR ANYTHING we had said. It was insulting and not sure we will return unless there is actual \" managers who listen!\"",

It was on off-peak time and indeed the tables remained unused for the duration of my visit, and my only option was the main bar with lighting inadequate for my planned perusal of the Phoenix New Times.  I'm not sure why the New Mexico platter includes bacon-wrapped shrimp. Is that a traditional New Mexican offering? The chicken burro was somewhere between Applebee's and movie theater concession caliber. The relleno was good. But the best part of this platter is the chile. The green is as excellent as its reputation and the red gives a fiery kick.  The carne adovada sliders put the red chile to good use and were also larger than typical sliders.",

We circled the block 3 times before asking the nice people at The Swizzle Stick where it was. This isn't the Sunset Strip people, get a small sign. While the food is okay, I had a bad experience in the Transgender bathroom with a male employee and a very drunk female patron. Needless to say the employee didn't wash his hands after whatever went down in the bathroom.  I expressed my concern to our waiter who seemed not in the least bit shocked. At the end of the night I couldn't finish my food due to the gross-out factor. Not even a beer was comped.  Obviously no regard for the customer's experience.",

You can see the chefs behind the bar cooking everything fresh. Everything comes out hot and flavored are astonishing. It's absolutely the best food I've had out in years. We've been for brunch a couple times and dinner too. I can say confidently order anything, it'll knock your socks off. Reasonably priced bc honestly I'd pay double for food this good.  Only con is the wait. Place is small, so go on off hours if you wanna get in right away. But really, even the con is a good sign since it means people keep coming back.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place out with all the good reviews and the great pictures!  It is not easy to find, like some yelpers warned.  We drove by it at first, even with the help of the navigation!  I never even saw a sign.  I finally found it by the sign on the door about the unattended children that I saw on one of the pics!    It is a pretty small place.  They have basically 2 rooms,  one a bar and a dining room so it is not that big.  It was pretty darkly lit but not too dark.  We sat at the bar which is also where they prepare the food.  It was fun watching them do their thing.  I was impressed that they grill over pecan wood!  When I saw that they had 2 skewers of rotisserie chicken I decided that was what I wanted.  I figured they had the chicken as an entree.  Unfortunately, the chicken was only for their chicken enchiladas!  What a tease!  They really should think about putting this on the menu.  I'm not sure if they cook the chicken every day, however.  Before we left they took the 8 chickens and put in a large plastic bin and, I assume, they would go into the cooler to save for the next day's chicken enchiladas.  I wonder how long they keep the chicken?  They have a pretty good selection on the menu plus quite a few specials on the chalkboard.  I had the grilled fish.  I think it was swordfish.  It was grilled over the pecan.  They also take half a pepper, put seasoned mashed potatoes on it and put that on the grill too.  Most of the orders that I saw had this on it as a side.  The fish was grilled to perfection, not overcooked which will ruin most fish.  Dry fish is no fun!   The salad was also very good.    I was close to giving them a 5 star review but had to take away one for the chicken issue,  but 4 is still a high review! I'll be back!",

I've eaten excellent New Mexican food. This isn't it. This is over priced and over salted cuisine with Spanish names. Everything is over done or under cooked.   Appetizers should also come hot. Not room temperature.   Fun Fact:   When you charge $27 for plate, it should at least be an upgrade from Chilis.   I will not blame this on this specific restaurant because I do not know if it was caused by Dicks or not. But I didn't feel well after dining here. We were left without water a lot so we initially thought it could have been that. However I did end up violently ill that night and part of me thinks it has everything to do with this place.",

For our appetizers, we had the bacon wrapped shrimp (might have been a tad overcooked), the stuffed mushrooms, and the garlic platter (delicious!).   For my main, I had the chorizo stuffed pork chops with the mango sauce.  They weren't necessarily stuffed, just two chops on top of one another with the chorizo in the middle (yeah! more chops!).  Great flavor, the pork was tender and juicy and the sweet (mango) and savory (chorizo) complemented one another well.  I'll be hard pressed to order something different the next time I go.  The food was 4.5 stars and the service was a solid 5.  Two things swung me to four stars.  We had a group of six so they put us in this weird room next to the bar  and we sat at this large L shaped table.  Made it difficult to have a conversation. Additionally, that room was hot.",

I was looking for a high chair and the guy was rude. However what really pissed me off is when he brought the food, he didn't say that the plate was super hot(not warm-hot- I'm talking oven-hot). Luckily my arm hit it and not my son who was sitting on my lap within reach of the plate. I guess as lucky as it was for my son, it was lucky for him because the plate would have been placed against his face if my son had been burnt. Good food but won't be back. Now I know why it's called Dick's Hideaway- because of him.",

But the waitstaff is excellent and quickly made me feel very comfortable. This is such a quirky place!! I explored the restaurant there are little rooms tucked away. Even the bathrooms are super interesting! Then cane the food! We ordered off the happy hour menu so we could try a few things. We tried roasted pork mole sliders, lobster sliders, bacon wrapped shrimp Jake Leno's, and the roasted garlic plate. Phenomenal!!! Every thing we pick was superbly done!! The garlic cloves were the largest I've ever seen!! Wow, wow, WOW!! We will definitely be back! Try this place, you will not be disappointed!!",

It's tucked away in a clean, well kept shopping center with no sign or advertisements. You could park right in front of it and miss not realize it's there. Walking in, you see that it is clean and cozy. It's a small place that is pretty creative with it's seating and I appreciate the uniqueness of the set up. To get to the other sitting area, you walk through part of the kitchen and you see how clean it is there too, which hits their score out of the park on \"clean factor\"! The service is very good as well. The staff takes care of your needs without all the unneccessary chatter to interrupt your evening, which I greatly appreciate. Now, for the good stuff- their food! Having tried several items off their menu, I can honestly say that I have not been dissappointed. Not even a little! The Carne Adovada is my favorite so far, with pork so soft and flavorful I can't help but order it every other time I go there! The red sauce they use in that dish is smooth and it is great with the eggs if you get the breakfast version of the plate. This place is great for breakfast, lunch and dinner, all occasions! Great for dates, or just a fantastic meal!",

An added bonus is there is a reverse happy hour that starts at 9 pm I believe. The food is out of this world. We started with the spicy chicken tostadas, great flavor and a big appetizer for 2 people. I got the enchiladas Christmas style (red & green sauce). I got the green chili pork, chicken, and shrimp enchiladas and they were some of the best I've ever had. They have a lot of great daily specials that I can't wait to check out next time. Great food, service, ambiance. You can't go wrong here.",

This place is super small. So this place gets one star for the ambience and back story.  The other star is for the mash potato stuff green chili. The menu we got had no prices. I had the green pork mole. The waiter said it's smoked for 8 hours. This was like a chunk of beef that tasted like pulled out of the crock pot with green sauce poured on top.  Typically mole is simmered in sauce for hours.My wife had the fish medley plate. For $15 I would say it's an awesome plate. For $37 I would like for it to knock my socks off a little and it didn't.  My friends had the bone in prime rib. Big chunk of tasteless meat. Between the two of us it was around $90 that with no alcohol.",

The restaurant was packed and the poor staff had no clue who had checked in and who didn't. They took people that had just walked in before some that had been waiting for awhile. Same thing happened when it came time to take our orders at the communal table.     I have an allergy to cow's milk (not dairy) and I specifically let the waitress know what I can and can't have and I ordered accordingly. Our waitress though took it upon herself to eliminate all the dairy from my meal, except for the cheese the kitchen decided to put on my salad, yup, that's cow's milk.  Not to mention how long it took for just our salads to come out, about 25 mins. Interestingly enough, it only took a couple of minutes for a new salad to come out with no cheese. When my meal finally arrived there was no hollandaise sauce on it. It was a dry, overcooked piece of chicken with mushrooms and brussel sprouts with no seasoning what so ever. I had to request that be brought out and some butter for the vegetables so I could dress them myself. I was beyond through. We were there for almost 2 hours, while we watched 4 different parties come and go at our communal table while we sat painfully through this ordeal. I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if our service was better, but to have the service AND the food fail was too much. I hope they get it together.",

    "text": "This place is definitely an experience. First of all, i drove around the parking lot three times before i finally decided to just park and walk till I found it. It kind of reminded me of an old speakeasy in some senses.   At first, I was disappointed in the menu because I have strong New Mexican ties and I didn't really see any True authentic cuisine. Their were a couple of dishes, two or three tops, but for the most part it wasn't real authentic New Mexican cuisine. I almost left to go to another restaurant because of this and I'm glad that I didn't because the food was amazing!  If you're looking for authentic New Mexican cuisine, this isn't the place. Regardless, this is still an amazing place to eat. If I could make one recommendation is that I would rebrand it as a Latin food restaurant or remake their menu to have more New Mexican food (and of course give complimentary chips and salsa since that's the True New Mexican way).   Even though I didn't think that this is a True New Mexican restaurant, I'll still go back.",

    "text": "First and last time here.   Not only was it literally a hideaway it took us forever to find it. There is legit no signs leading to it. You gotta look online to find it. We tried last week and gave up. The menu sounded good so we looked it up and tried again this weekend. Which, I'm kinda disappointed we cared that much. Cause it sucked.   From walking in and getting yelled at it was strike one. My friend and I were literally barely sitting at a bar stool and a server walks up and goes um can you sit together? I said we're just sitting down while my friend was setting her purse down. We had to quickly sit down because some other customers nearly ran us over. I'm sorry, but getting told what to do by a random server when it's an open bar frustrates me as is. We barely had one butt cheek on the barstool before getting told where to move.   The service was good other than that. We had several people check on us and make sure we were taken care of.   The plates were SUPER HOT and no one told us they literally bake the food on there. I burned my arm. That felt great.   The place was so hot I couldn't enjoy my food. It was 100 degrees In there. We were literally dripping in sweat while trying to eat our food. The food was pretty good but not worth the getting yelled at, being burned, and hot temperature of the place.   As I told my friend. Doesn't hurt to try a place at least once. But, this will be our first and last time here.",

I can think of no where else I'd like to be nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning. It's hard to get a seat but I always get lucky and grab a spot at the bar. It's dark and cozy, a nice place to hide.   You'll have to make the ultimate decision between red and green chile. They're both amazing but maybe too spicy for some so you can get a small sample of each before choosing.   I usually go for the carne adovada and eggs but the enchiladas and chile rellanos are also beyond good. I'm a red chile kind of person... The wine selection is great and mimosas are on point. The bloody Mary's are so hot they serve them with a beer chasers so be aware. Dick's does dinner too but brunch is served until three and I can't get enough.",

I have eaten Mexican food all over Mexico and the US Southwest.  If these people who give this place a high rating really think this is good Mexican food, then they need to get out more..... Much more! Taco Bell has tastier food.  The bar has room for 6, they cram 9 people in there so everyone is breathing in your food. The ceilings are low, the place is cramped and noisy.  The staff starts barking questions at you the moment you enter.  Overall a bad dining experience, I won't go back.",

Yes, you read this correctly, Every Day.    When I lived in AZ, I stopped in a few times for drinks, but it took moving away and coming back to visit to finally come to my senses and order food.  Duh.  Happily settled in with my mimosa (scandalously on a Monday!) my friend and I enjoyed:  Carne Adovada Benedict  with hash browns - I cannot say enough good things about this.  The generous portion of delicious pork topped with two perfectly poached eggs completely hid the English muffins beneath.  I ordered this without the beans that usually accompany it, and there was still more food than I could possibly finish.  Carne Adovada & Eggs - more glorious pork, served with eggs (any style) and beans.  Roasted Garlic Plate - not quite sure what we were thinking when we added this to our (already large) order.  I was happy we did, though.  An enormous head of roasted garlic served with toasted bread, roasted chilies and cheese.  I was absolutely safe from vampires for the rest of the day.    Our bartender/waiter was fantastic.  Handing me another mimosa before I can even think of asking for it will make me love you forever.  For-Ev-Er!  A word of advice.  Don't touch the plates.  No matter how badly you may want to. They are HOT.  Trust me on this one, OK?",

All I will say is SMOKED PORK!  OMG...it's like sensory overload when it comes the pork paired with the hollandaise sauce on the benedict and then you add the beans and potatoes, it's quite possibly the best breakfast on the planet!  Know before you go:  It's called \"Hideaway\" for a reason...it's virtually impossible to find.  Look for the hardware store and the door will be to the left.  There is no sign.  It's always crowded so be ready to sit at a community table if there is no room in the bar.  It may seem awkward but you can meet some interesting folks AND you have a great view of the fireplace with just a slight sent of mesquite.  Their Bloody Mary's are BOMB-diggity served with a shot of beer which I like to pour in.  Great hangover remedy!  They open early at 7am to accommodate my early arrival flights!  Booya!

Dark and pleasantly smoky from a wood burning fire, great margaritas and green chili pasta I can't stop thinking about. Unmarked but not hard to find. Winner!",

A local friend brought us here and it was utterly amazing. The chicken tostado was amazing.... the Pasta Heidi.... oohh laaa laaa and the Chimayo Chicken was excellent too. We definitely recommend this for SW Mexican fare. Try the Rodney Strong Chardonnay as it was very smooth.",

    "text": "Well, I guess the name was a hint to its location because it is indeed hidden. There is no signage on the street or even on the door and parking is limited (additional spots behind the building). It's located between Luci's and TEXAZ Grill. Look for the address \"6008\" over the black vertical-barred doors. You enter to the bar and a few tables and there is additional seating on the right through a short hall. You seat yourselves.  Our server arrived quickly and along with the bartender made a wonderful and friendly team. Service was consistently great throughout our visit and our water glasses were always full. I also loved the laidback and mellow atmosphere of the restaurant. Great spot for a date!  We came for brunch (served daily until 4pm) --  Spicy Chicken Tostadas ($9): Three tostadas topped with salsa fresca. The menu deceptively says mini, but the tostadas are as large as an appetizer plate and piled high with lettuce and marinated chicken. The chicken, although slightly dry, were flavorful and the tostadas were delightfully crispy. I could eat a few of these.  Carne Adovada Benedict ($14): Two poached eggs, English muffin, Carne Adovada, jalapeno hollandaise, beans, and potatoes. I was really excited about this dish because I have a thing for unique eggs benedicts, however, it was just okay. I didn't really enjoy the adovada as I could only taste the chilies. I liked the addition of jalapeno in the hollandaise. Beware: it's spicy!  Pasta Heidi ($16): Green chile linguine, grilled chicken, and chipotle cream sauce. This is a wonderful dish! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. It had the right amount of spice without being overpowering. A little on the heavier side, so it doesn't hurt to share the plate with someone else. Highly recommended!",

The wife had Blueberry pancakes that were fluffy and delicious, I went for the Eggs breakfast with the NM sausage.  Eggs came out over easy as requested and the sausage hit the spot.

As with their sister restaurant Rokerij, the smell of burning wood permeates the place. They serve beer and cocktails and have a good selection of wine. The food here is great. If you don't mind waiting this is a great place for brunch. The green chile meatloaf is probably my favorite-it is served over a tortilla with beans and two eggs. OH IT IS SOOOOO GOOD!!!!

New Mexican styled cuisine. Almost everything is cooked over a wood grill. Great daily specials. Stiff cocktails and great wine selection. Try the prickly pear margarita! GARLIC PLATE, GREEN CHILI BURGER, PORK CHOP CHORIZO, CHIMAYO CHICKEN, EGGS BENEDICT JALAPENO, are some great choices. Can also try their other restaurants Richardson's and Rokerij right up the street.",

As I walked into the restaurant, I immediately saw it as the kind of place that I could bring out of town guests to in an effort to convince them that unique, soulful restaurants can exist within strip malls.  We sat at the bar and ordered a beer and a glass of wine - good selection at reasonable prices.  For our meals, we decided on the Chimayo Chicken and the Tamale Plate.  Unfortunately, both were mediocre.  The chicken was a little bland and sounded better on the menu than it tasted, which at $24 was annoying.  The tamales were dry, although when we got some extra red chile to put on top, they improved a bit.  I still have high hopes for Dick's Hideaway, but I'll need to hunt to find the best menu items before bringing guests here: 3 stars",

Truly hidden away, I drove past it a few times, then finally pulled into a lot to call and ask if they were still open and confirm their address (if you see Lucy's, go one door over).  Small and dark upon entrance, I took a seat at the bar.  The menu was to drool over and caused me to waver between something with pork loin or something more Southwestern.  I opted for tha latter.  I had the shrimp enchiladas with beans, red chile sauce, scrambled eggs, and potatoes.  The first bite was kind of strange since it was a food combination I was not used to, but soon I was devouring it like manna in the desert and did not leave a morsel over.  I did not partake, but they also had mimosas for $5. If I return to the Phoenix are, I definitely would return.  I would love to check out lunch or dinner.   Worth the search!",

Just a bar and 3 1/2 tables.  It looks like they did have a small place for groups when you walk in on the right.  The place was super cozy and inviting and the service was great.  One of the servers was a fellow gaucho so instant connection, obviously.  Food:  ROASTED GARLIC PLACE- A MUST!!!!!!  This dish is crazy good.  Sure a lot of garlic is never amazing for the stomach, but it's well worth it.  The plate comes with a huge roasted garlic, sauteed peppers covered in 3 different sauces smothered in melted cheese, and all on a flour tortilla underneath.  It really was the most amazing thing.  Also this is SUPER FILLING!    Blue, red and white corn enchiladas and Carne Adovada-  Both of these were nothing amazing and awfully hard to follow after the garlic plate.  We both agreed that for main dishes we enjoyed our food at Carlsbad Tavern the previous night.  Maybe it was because of what we ordered.  A shrimp quesadilla to me was foreign and not super enjoyable.  The rice was ok.  And everything seemed really greasy.  Also the play list was AWESOME.  From Rolling Stones to the Band to Tom Petty, I absolutely loved the music and in general the atmosphere of this place.  Overall, I almost wish we had stopped with our negra modelos (on tap!!) and the roasted garlic place.  Everything was still good but not as amazing as the garlic plate!",

It was small and dark, but we could tell immediately that what they lacked in size, they made up for in large, delicious plates! In fact, their dishes are so large they can be easily shared for up to two people. They had whole chickens roasting over an open fire pit. That was pretty cool. Don't expect to go dancing after, as your clothes and your hair will smell deliciously of food.   One thing we've found helpful was to ask the server what the restaurant is best known for. The server said the Carne Avodava. This dish was in a class of its own, and I highly recommend it. We also ordered the New Mexican Platter, which gave us a generous sampling of their chile relleno, tamale, and chicken burrito. The spices they used for all three dishes were incredible!   They serve breakfast too, but we didn't get a chance to return. When in Phoenix, Dick's Hideaway is a MUST!",

    "text": "Love, love, love. That's if you can find it, of course.  This gem is really tucked away - hence, the \"hideaway.\"  Dick's is unmarked in the strip mall at 16th and Bethany between the hardware store and Luci's.  It makes for the perfect Saturday or Sunday brunch spot, as long as you don't mind dark (low light / no windows) quarters.    They have great Sunday mimosa specials - $5! Can't beat that! My favorite dishes are the traditional Mexican dishes. Hands down, the chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauce are the best. The chips / salsa rock too - although it's not complimentary. Diner beware... their mexican food is spicy, so order a margarita or a glass of milk to dull the spice.  Oh, and check out the back bathroom - funny and odd (not the one off the kitchen).",

    "text": "It's dark in there!  Honestly, I walked in last Saturday and it was like trying to see where you are going right after you turn out the bathroom light at 2:00 am:)  The last time I was at one of the Burning Embers/Richarsdson's Family of Restaurant offerings (Richardson's, Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway, as I understand it), I told myself I wouldn't be returning...I had listened to the boss (the owner?) screaming at an employee, over some error, for a solid 3-4 minutes as the Beautiful Carin and I tried to eat a nice dinner at Richardson's:(  It was like watching Hell's Kitchen, up close and personal.  And not what I expect in a dinner house, quasi fine dining establishment.  However, I got roped into a post squash tournament group brunch/retox with my buddies from the Village.  They all wanted to go to Dick's, so I was outvoted...I could have gone home, but that would have been impolite and no fun:)  As I stumbled over the threshold trying to adjust my eyes from the arc welder intensity of the Phoenix noon hour, to the eerie dark wood, leather and no light world that is the Hideway, I told myself \"well, I didn't darken their door again...the door was already darkened\":)  Would I have gone back on my own...even to score a coveted review for Yelp?   I'm going to have to say \"No\"...Much as I love the spicy food and the New Mexican style of cooking, I was pretty sure that I would rather drive to Santa Fe for New Mexican style food than have dinner disturbed by a Gordon Ramsey wanna be again:(  But you know something...I am not one to hold a grudge or to be \"Donnie Downer\" so let's start with some positives from the brunch the other day:  * There was no screaming, whatsoever:)  * The service was outstanding...no really, our server was excellent  and friendly, as well as knowledgeable and competent:)  * They know how to make a pretty good vodka martini:)  * They sure know where to find the peppers in the kitchen:)  * The menu is reasonably creative:)  On the other hand (oh, you knew it was coming...two stars...it couldn't be that everything was great)  * The Carne Adovada and Eggs (the \"signature\" dish, as I understand it) was mediocre...the pork was pretty dry, the potatoes were a bit undercooked and I was frankly glad for the eggs and beans to put a little moisture back in the dish...the flavors were good, though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done, I could see this dish being a solid choice:)  * $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon...really? I don't like to complain about prices, generally, but this seems to be a stretch...these things were  1/2 the size of the marti's at oh, say AZ88, yet they cost more. That doesn't make me happy:(  I just haven't had the best of luck with places named \"Dick's\" anything...Dickey's BBQ is just a pit and Dickie's Dog's apparently fed the wrong person a crappy hot dog one too many times and got fire bombs thrown through their front window for their trouble.  The Richardson's Family of Restaurants has already had enough trouble along the fire front, so I certainly wish them the best with their restaurant activities.  But I probably won't be back until the next time one of my buddies wants to drag me here again...or if I miss an episode of Hell's Kitchen and want to catch up:)",

    "text": "My very 1st Arizonian eat occurred in this no-joke hideaway.  Its cross intersection was a good indicator, but yeah--what a D^&# it was to uselessly search for its giant signage.  All we could additionally rely on were its 2 front doors falling almost directly below the \"Sunbrite Corner\" and the helpful host aiding Kurdy S--on the phone--navigate him, Daniel L, & me to the right, high-end HITW.  Once inside, there could be several interpretations or feelings about this crowded, dimly lit (thus not very photo-friendly) and compressed space, leaving an elongated table in this separate section exclusively suited for humongous groups.  The 3 of us sat in one of their high-rise, smallish bar table across from the typical bar arrangement, & after looking through our paper mat menu we decided on the Red Pork Chile Tamale plate ($13), the New Mexican Platter ($16), & the Green Chile Cheeseburger ($13).  Keep in mind that we were seriously curious about Phoenix's Tex Mex cuisine--so please expect flavor instead of questioning authenticity =).  DL's New Mexican Platter came with 3 samplers--Red Pork Chile Tamale, Chile Relleno, and Chicken Burro--plus rice and beans.  Outrageously yet deliciously cheesy & smoky yet slowly spicy were the most remarkable essences, while the textures of the nicely seasoned rice, pinto beans, chile, & masa of the tamale were refined and gnaw-friendly--i.e. no mushiness.  Of those samplers, though, the pork one would have to be my least favorite for its average meat being too decent for its price.  Several weeks of me being burger-deprived were my reason to irresistibly choose this pecan wood-grilled, 8-ounce hunk.  In spite of flaunting a medium degree, rather than a medium rare I did request, the beef was easily steak knife-cut, juicy, & agreeably smoky.  Plus, I pretty much was chomping on that yummy Chile Relleno on top of the meat, & that was the only veggie topping sandwiched in its spongy bun.  The seasoned fries were ample & cordially tasty, but b/c of its slightly soft exterior for its dense cut I wished it had that all-familiar bite.  So from our experience I relished the ginormous goops of cheese & smoky sensation of the red chili and beef patty, which all speak out to those who, like me, have a crush on at least one of them.  Service and mostly the clientele could give a much friendlier vibe, but our waiter was spot-on accommodating, advising us to be careful handling our hot iron plates.  They're not presenting any entities calling out that D-word, but I think a revisit for their Enchiladas & Carne Adovada would sanguinely suffice for a 4.  Just look on the Sunbrite side =).",

    "text": "Dinner for 4, 7P on a Thursday.  I found the location no problem but I did Google a picture of the front since I had heard it was difficult to find.  Another person just put the address in to navigation and had a heck of time.  The couple in our party was sent to a completely wrong address by Google.  The place is small.  We were in the only booth.  The balance of the seating is shared tables.  Dick's came highly recommend.  We started with the New Mexican Con Queso.  Delicious.  Could have eaten the entire bowl myself.  I ordered a special, Taos Trio, rice, beans, 2 New Mexican sausages, two bacon wrapped shrimp, one red, one green and a Carne Adovada quesadilla.  A lot of food.  Rice and beans (whole) were ok.  I consider these filler food.  The sausage was fantastic.  Not hot but very flavorful.  Shrimp were good.  Red was by far the better of the two.  A very nice heat.  The Adovada was SO scrumptious.  I would absolutely order this dish again.  Guest 2 had the New Mexican Surf and Turf.  Loved the shrimp, red was best.  Could not stop talking about the beans.  Ate mine as well.  Very much like his grandmother's.  The layered enchiladas were made with crispy corn tortillas which he was not expecting and it threw him.  Thought the food overall was good but pricey.  Guest 3 ordered the Pappardelle and a couple glasses of wine.  Did not care for it one bit.  Said the duck was overdone and had a weird seasoning.  She literally had 6 or so bites.  At the end of the meal she had a full dish and the waitress did not even question her when she declined a to-go box.  Not the best customer service.  Guest 4 ordered another special, Beef Stroganoff.  Green chili pasta noodles with huge pieces of roasted meat on the rare side.  He said individually they were very good but did not care for them together.  All the meals but mine came with a salad.  Based on this meal I would stick with the more traditional New Mexican dishes for the best experience.",

    "text": "Wow, what can I say about a place I walked out of?   The bottled beer was good...     First, it's a hideaway.  So no road signage, and VERY difficult to find parking.  I called and they explained that to me.  If that were the only issue I would have chalked it up to uniqueness and been happy, but...  We walked in to this expecting a restaurant.   We found a bar, that also has a restaurant.  When you first walk in, you walk into a very small and uncomfortably crowded bar.  We were there for lunch and surprised at how cramped it was.  So we thought OK, where do we sit. The bartender said we could sit over in the \"other\" area. The other area was the restaurant seating.  The restaurant seating is actually pretty nice. As we walked in there was a gentleman placing menus on the tables, in the otherwise completely empty area. We asked him where was we should sit and he said \"it doesn't matter\". So we found a table and my wife and I sat down.  The waiter was really the beginning and the end of our problems. He asked us what we wanted to drink, then walked away and around a corner.  But still kept talking.  My wife ordered a Coke, I asked him if he was familiar with the beers. At this point shouting a little because he was around a corner and behind a divider.  He said, \"what do you mean?\" I said \"do you know the beers?  Like if I were to tell you what I was looking for would you be able to tell me what beer to get?\" He said \"well tell me what you want and I'll tell you if I know.\"  I just said give me a dark beer because I did not trust him to tell me much about the beers at that point.  We waited five to ten minutes for my beer to show back up, but no Coke for my wife. He brought out water glasses but never filled them.  There was also no offer or mention of chips and salsa. I don't even know if that's something they offer. But when I searched on yelp for best chips and salsa, this restaurant came up. It is not their fault if yelp search engine is screwed up but certainly we never saw them if they offer them.  He disappeared after giving me the beer and ten minutes later came back and asked if we knew what we wanted or had questions. I said I did, and asked him if the adovada was hot. He said \"give me a second\" and walked out without another word.  After five more minutes he came back with the adovada,  a green, and a red sauce.  I thought that was very nice, but then he said \"there's the adovada and I figured her next questions were going to be about the sauces\".  Then he was gone again. And not like he stood there for a few seconds and then moved on, I mean like before we could say thank you he was gone. Still no Coke, no water, no chips and salsa, no service other than samples.    The adovada and the sauces were all very good. I would love to have stayed and tried them on actual food. But unfortunately we did not see your waiter again for 15 minutes. I finished my beer. He still had not returned. My wife and I decided that we should try somewhere else. We walked out, took my beer bottle with me so I could show whomever what I drank and they could charge me, walked into the bar, And there was our waiter.  He walked up very quickly.  I don't know where he was or what he was doing but he was on me quick.  \"OK, did you decide on what to eat? \". Seriously, that's what he asked. With my wife and I standing there looking at him. I said no, we're leaving. At this point it had been 35-45 minutes.  He said oh OK. In retrospect I think he was quick to get to us because he didn't want us talking to any other servers or employees at the restaurant.   Anyway, he charged me full price for the beer, I paid and we walked out.  Based on this I did something I never do, I gave no tip.  Maybe it was an off day, but we won't be back. I've been to Richardson's and Rojkeri (sp?). Both of those restaurants by the same owners are good and fairly close to this one. Skip the hideaway and go to Richardson's.",

    "text": "Quick Hit: Consider Checking Out  The place was recommended to me by several friends that have lived in Phoenix their whole lives as a tucked away restaurant gem serving authentic New Mexican Cuisine. Gem is an adequate description since the restaurant is decently nondescript in external appearance and seating is very limited - they have a handful of tables and bar seating available. Due to limited space and great popularity, you would expect significantly long waiting times. Indeed when we arrived there for brunch there was hordes of folks waiting outside. This sight alone deterred other Dicks Hideaway dining hopefuls from trying again another time. We decided to wait and have drinks (Bloody Mary and Dicks White Sangria - both well made, and the sangria is like drinking liquid candy, it was delicious). With drinks in hand, the 30 minute wait seemed much shorter. The restaurant atmosphere is definitely a relaxed one with humorous tag lines and stickers with funny phrases scattered across the walls. Heck, you are even greeted at the door by a \"kids left alone will receive a drink and a kitten\" - don't quote me directly. All in all, real chill and laid back vibe. Now for the most important part, the food. Several appetizing items on the menu representing New Mexican cuisine. In all honesty, the items looked more appetizing on the menu than it truly tasted. After eating my steak Benedict and sampling my friends dishes, everything was just ok. Some dishes were so over seasoned that it completely masked the individual taste of the combined ingredients, while mine was blandly flavored. The food portions were large and came out hot (actually the plates are so hot that I encourage you to wait several minutes or you may get a first degree burn - serious). Service was incredibly friendly, grounded, and accommodating. The service rounded out the experience.  Overall, cool place, decent food.",

And the Richardson's combination plate with one jalapeno benedict and two chicken enchiladas with green chili, asparagus with hollandaise 15.  The guys and gals are super duper friendly and my meal was excellent. I have learned the original Richardson's of New Mexico will be opening up in about three weeks. Can't wait to see the new shack.

I had the Blackened Scallops and he had the Carne Adovada.  We were both blown away by the flavor of our dishes.  I actually couldn't stop eating mine - it had five different sauces.  I don't eat meat and the bartender let me know there was chicken stock in the rice so I just got the beans with it.  Very cool and I really appreciated it.  The vibe here was low-key and just great.  We sat at the bar.  The margaritas were very tasty too.  We will definitely return whenever we are in town and will always recommend it.  Terrific!",

It's definitely not inexpensive, but I wouldn't say it's outrageously priced.  You get what you pay for: fine food, prepared well, served in a pretty cool space.   It's New Mexican cuisine.  I'm not sure what, exactly, that means, but there were a lot of chillies and tortillas.   There's not a whole lot of seating, so you may or may not get seated right away.  And I think they discourage bringing children, although I don't think they're necessarily unwelcome.   Also, I guess they have excellent breakfast, although I ate dinner when I went.",
