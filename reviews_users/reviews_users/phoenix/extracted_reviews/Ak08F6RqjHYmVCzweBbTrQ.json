    "text": "We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \"Excuse me, miss?\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us \"good luck\". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables.   The front of the house is EVERYTHING in the restaurant world. That girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business. I've heard great things about the food but I'll never go back.",

It seem the pricing has change this time, for shrimp, it is now $3 extra. alright, that's fine. when the dish came out, I was so disappointed. I didn't even see any shrimps and when I did find them, there was only 2!!! $3 extra for two shrimps! the presentation of the dish and taste was not the same and portion was smaller. did they have new chef or new owner? will not come back to this place",

I got boar and found the lime to be so overwhelming that I couldn't eat it. I wrote that off to cultural tastes but I definitely won't be ordering that again.",

I'm happy to report that the Pad Thai is very good here - maybe not the best I've had in the Valley but not far from it.  My dining partner reported his dish (Curry Chicken) was delicious too.  And the Thai iced coffee is so damn good they should list it under desserts.   Comfortable vibe, friendly staff, good beer selection, ample parking, reasonable prices, nice patio, and from the photos, a big hit with our local newscasters.",

    "text": "Sucks. Very bland Americanized \"thai\". My food had HAIR in IT. Presentation is nice. Cocktails are ok. Food is ultra bland and nothing like real thai food ala thai town los angeles. Boring over priced. I had a \"ginger\" fish. That was ultra fried no flavor. Where's the ginger? Tasted like fast food fish. Literally topped and seasoned with nothing. Pad thai ultra bland even though we got spicy.  Wheres the fried egg and shallots that pad thai is supposed to have? And the shrimp tasted frozen and over done. Lack luster. Tasted like microwave frozen pad thai. But it was pretty. That was its selling pointing. Never again. 70+ for meal that tasted like 10. Ultra disappointed. Had i never had an authentic thai dish i might think this place was interested. Considering the low quality of food and the ultra wait.  Not worth your money. Find a thai place that actually caters to thai people. Lame. Bland. Ultra disappointing. Never again. My companion from the east coast was also ultra disappointed. He had never had such poor bland thai food. And both of us loooove thai food. So let down to say the least. :/",

Definitely a treat and different. Have not had a dish here that I did not like. Mango cheesecake is a must. Love this place. The outdoor seating is precious even though smack dab in central phx",

    "text": "We started with the jasmine iced tea.  Very refreshing and I didn't even add sugar to it.  A couple starters. Lab Gal and Dragon Eggz. The Eggz were amazing. Keep in mind all the food brought to our table was presented as you would see in magazines. Works of art on plates. I ordered a Papua salad. Whoooweee spicey just like I like it. I had the chicken and yellow curry. Gawd it was sooo good. My fiance opted for the wild boar dish. BC we were pretty sure they were True to the 3 pepper heat index he asked if they'd do a not so spicey version. he was thrilled with his plate. He said my 1 pepper index salad was spicier.... Portions are large and I felt that prices were more than fair. Seating on the inside is limited and very classy. We showed up around 630ish on Friday (night before Valentine's Day) and the place quickly filled up after that. Outside seating looked like a lot of fun and they have heaters out there too. If given a choice, I would have chosen out there. Although not a black tie place, people were dressed from way below casual to dresses. Service took a little bit, but very well worth the wait. The staff were very nice and informative. When we come back next year, we will be having dinner here again.",

    "text": "Some friends of mine took me to the Wild Thaiger for my birthday.  I can't think of a better place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic!  The food was great and served with True elegance but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely packed, the service was great.  We were told right from the start that there would be at least a 20 minute wait and they were dead on in their estimate.  No problem at all.  I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate.   The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  Can you say clean?  Even on such a busy night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  The kitchen is open to the dinning area and you can see how well managed and organized every thing is.  The kitchen staff looked like a well oiled machine in action.  The Food and Drinks: Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out to a local night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection!  I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.  Appetizers: We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.  Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.  Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!  Wild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.  Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.  Hot Pot: We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.  Main Course: I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!  Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.  Desert: OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!  Enough said. Period!  Will I go back? I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal there.  Hats off to The Wild Thaiger. The best Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.",

We asked to sit on their lovely, heated patio, but quickly realized that the kids were not going to be agreeable for a nice meal... so we opted to place an order to go. My son and I shared the yellow chicken curry and pad Thai. Both were fresh and flavorful with just the right amount of heat. You know it is good when a seven-year old asks for a third helping! I only wish there had been more rice... I have leftover curry to eat and we finished the rice last night! I'll be back for sure!",

The peanut chicken is great, as is the pad thai (doesn't taste like normal pad thai, but it's good: chicken, tofu, and shrimp, with lots of peanuts).  But I think a different chef comes in for dinner and weekends, because the dishes are remarkably different. I don't understand what's going on.  In other words, come for lunch.",

First of all, their lunch menu is really small. When I sat down and realized that my favorite dishes weren't even on their menu, I was immediately disappointed. I had their papaya salad and honestly, it wasn't that great. It was actually one of the worst ones I've ever had. The flavoring was really off. How do I know? I am Thai and grew up there, so I know what som tum is supposed to taste like. And it really does not taste like that. I had some of their pad thai also and was really really disappointed. I mean, for the prices they charge and for the wait time and horrible service, I was really expecting something really good.   The mood was actually really nice. Their decorations and open kitchen were a really nice touch, which is what they're getting the star for. However, it did become very loud very fast when the room filled up. It was difficult to keep a conversation going.   For all the hype that people have made about this place, I honestly expected a lot better. But even if I walked in without any expectations, I would have still be disappointed.",

White tablecloth, good cutlery, big wine glasses, open kitchen, spicy dishes presented with flair - I'm impressed! I had beef Kiewan, a delicious green curry that packed solid (American-gauge) heat. The corn fritters are crunchy and good, served with jalapenos and cucumber. The coconut milk-based soup with chicken was a hit around the table. Pork, beef, ribs, vegetarian, salmon - everything got a solid thumbs up.   Good drinks. Our server was first rate and unusually sweet. Maybe it's not cutting edge Scottsdale, but Wild Thaiger serves up tongue tingling food at fair prices in an attractive interior space.  They've stepped up, and if you're in the neighborhood, you should too.",

I used to work at this establishment back in my high school days when the owners kept me on despite my less than exemplary work ethic, but that does not change the superb quality of the food.  I have pretty much tried everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The curries are absolutely amazing.  The panang is spicy and sweet and the kiew wan has a zestiness to it that cuts through the spice.  The Tamarind Shrimp is another personal favorite, perfectly breaded and fried jumbo shrimp drizzled in a sweet-sour tamarind sauce, with just the right amount of heat.  The Pad Thai is amazing, and the Kimow is excruciatingly spicy and tasty.  But perhaps the most attractive aspect of the restaurant is the vegetarian-friendly menu.  This is perhaps the only place in Phoenix, nay, the world where my carnivorous family and my vegetarian girlfriend and I can truly dine together in peace. They have numerous appetizers and dishes which are strictly vegetarian, and most curries and noodle dishes can be made to accommodate vegetarian restrictions.",

The lady on the phone said it was not an issue. We got there and it was packed on a Friday night. The hostess said it would be 20 minutes for a table. Literally two seconds later, there was a four person table cleared. I asked for the table and she got someone to clean it for us. The place was busy and noisy.  The menu was limited and average priced for most items. I craved noodles so ordered the Pad-Seiw. The noodles were alright. Somehow seems like there should be basil in the dish and not a bunch of cauliflower. The hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice.  Later our server later came back to tell us that they were going to charge us 5 dollars for bringing our own cake. Nice how that was not mentioned on the phone or when she first took the cake to the fridge for us.  So sadly we will not be returning. Thai Rama has much better food and service.",

They are a little on the slow side but it's nothing to lessen the 5 star rating or prevent me from ever coming back. The waiters are always extremely nice which makes up for it too.   I always get the yellow curry with tofu and veggies and it's just to die for. It's creamy, rich, and plated beautifully. We always order 2 of the Satay Sampler, one with the works and one with only chicken. I personally think the works is the best way to go. The chicken, beef, and shrimp all pair perfectly with the peanut sauce, I can't even decide which meat is best. We also ordered a Tom Ka Gai to share and it was A+++. Lastly, we ordered a Milk Tea. I'm a sucker for boba and their boba was good. Good not great. The milk tea tasted like cereal milk, which was strange, but not unappetizing.",

That said, if you want to linger and chat, the servers do not hover or make you feel like you should leave, which is nice.   Seating: Booths/tables, bar, and outdoor patio. The outdoor patio is nice but can be noisy with passing traffic, and the light rail passes often with its bells.   Food: I do not eat meat, so that poses limitations for my intakes.  That said, I chose a dish that had eggplant (I dislike eggplant), and they were able to add whatever veggies I requested.  The dish also contained pumpkin, which was not very good, but the broccoli and other veggies were tasty.   I have been here before and ordered the Tom Yum soup, which is often my testing point of a Thai restaurant. It's quite good and extra spicy.   My date ordered some meat-based dish. He seemed to enjoy it.    I have ordered appetizers here before and enjoy the fresh rolls and corn fritters.   The corn fritters are super greasy, though.

I sat outside and it was nice, not too crowded on a Wednesday night. Our orders were taken pretty quickly, I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was tofu and vegetables in a coconut broth. Was served in a metal bowl that had a flame in the middle which was pretty crazy. Was a little bit difficult for me to ladle the soup from the metal thing into the bowl without making a huge mess. But it went ok! The food was delicious. It was not spicy at all though. Also there were a few slices of what looked like potato in there, and it wasn't potato. It was sliced ginger, and eating that big of a hunk of ginger is not really a pleasant experience. Otherwise, I enjoyed it! Was not too expensive, I'm sure it would be a great place to come for lunch too.",

The cucumber chutney was light and refreshing and went well with the corn fritters. I thought the fritters were very unique and never had anything like them before.  I enjoyed the 24K, it was really delicious Thai Pumpkin, Two kinds of eggplant including Thai, fresh green beans in spicy green curry. I added chicken to the dish and it was prepared well. I thought this dish was delicious but would have been much better if they just added a little fresh basil.   My husband really enjoyed the Sliced WILD BOAR in HOT red chili sauce.   Service was very good. We had two servers that both checked on us several times and also offered refills before we even needed them.

    "text": "\"Thai\" offers so many great pun opportunities for naming a restaurant, and it's great to see an establishment take advantage of it. Wild Thaiger is a top 5 use of \"Thai\" in a pun for a restaurant.  Other contenders:  \"Thaired Elephant\" - for a slow paced dining experience that you will remember \"Thai-Died\" - for a restaurant inherited by hippies \"My Thaip of Food\" - to cast a wide net \"Thair Cuts\" - to draw in confused people who want to get their hair cut but might buy Thai food if you get them in the restaurant  \"Wild Thaiger\" is a pretty good name for this place though. It serves Thai food, which is pretty important for a restaurant to do if it's going to have \"Thai\" in its name. No feral waitresses or staff appeared during our visit, which led me to believe the \"Wild\" element is probably just stylistic.  So 5 stars.  Good for: people who appreciate puns in restaurant names. Bad for: people who want to see wild animals. I would recommend a zoo for that.",

    "text": "I'll admit to occasional skepticism of DDD featured restaurants, but I've dined here pre and post DDD, so its not a factor in this review. In fact, I'd much rather drop into the Wild Thaiger (love the name) than its more illustrious and aging neighbor Durant's.   We sampled a couple of soups and peanut chicken on our latest visit and, as usual, loved all the selections. We arrived for dinner a bit early on a weeknight and had no wait. Service was prompt and courteous. Menu pricing is reasonable for the quality and location. The kitchen is open concept (sorry, I'm mixing up DDD with Home Hunters) and visible to the curious if you like seeing your food prepared. And the decor is part tiger, part Thai.   There are a lot of excellent Thai spots in the Valley, making it a very competitive category in which to earn a five star review. Wild Thaiger is very close. It's also just a bit different from the norm. We always do soup at the Thaiger, not our norm. If you have a passion for Thai cuisine, definitely give Wild Thaiger a try. I wish it was located a bit closer to where I live so that I could more easily frequent it and ponder an upgrade to five stars.",

We placed a takeout order during a recent visit. The young lady who helped us was so sweet and super helpful. She even accomodated a special request in making a pad woon sen for us even though it was not on their menu specifically. Fried rice, panang, Pad Thai,  Thai Tea, everything we tried was delicious! If you are new to Thai flavors, this place is great!!  We requested not too spicy and the flavors were just perfect. When I saw that they were featured on Guy Fieri's Diners Driveins and Dives from The Food Network, that made me even more excited to try this place.  I hope to find their episode sometime to watch it. Amazing customer service and a beautiful space to dine inside and outside. Look forward to returning!!!  Ample parking in a private lot behind the restaurant.",

I'm vegan so it's hard for me to find places where I can eat anything. This place had multiple options and everything I tasted was good. I had the Tofu Veggie Pansang.

    "text": "4.5 or maybe 4.6  Finally got to try Wild Thaiger. By what I have read and now I interpreted the menu, I thought it was just fancy schmancy version of my fave Thai dishes. Since I'm not one to mess with classics, I didn't know how I'd like this spot. Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.  We started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.  For our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn't totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they're supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over.   The other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow.   We ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn't look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.  We ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn't get to see it. Nevertheless, it was an awesome meal and I'm super stoked to have that cool Thai spot within walking/stumbling distance to the casa.",

My friend and I sat and waited as we watched the tables clear out one by one and no food came out.  I had to flag the waitress down twice before she would even respond as to why we had been waiting for 1/2 hour at this point for our food. It was a piss poor excuse and they weren't that apologetic.  We finally got our food  45 minutes into my hour lunch and it wasn't as good as the first time.  Pad thai was barely warm enough to eat.  If you want chili paste brought to your table.... an additional .50 cents.  WTF?  There prices are high enough to compensate the making of chili paste dry or wet.  I don't know if I will come back here.  I would rather drive down the road a few miles and go somewhere else.  Sadly.",

    "text": "After watching Guy Fieri showcasing Wild Thaiger restaurant, we made the hour long drive to visit the establishment. The restaurant is located in downtown Phoenix inside a small building, which was probably a home before it was turned into a restaurant. There is a quaint patio area outside since seating is limited inside the store. The restaurant's decor is modern Thai and the menu has a more limited selection of Thai entrees compared to other Thai restaurants in the area. The pricing is also higher than their competitors. We ordered the Dragon eggs, Papaya Salad & the Penang Curry. The dragon eggs are similar to the Chinese Shrimp Shumai dumplings. We ordered them crispy & the dragon eggs were good, but the sauce was on the saltier side & after the dumplings sat in the sauce, the dumplings became salty as well. The Papaya Salad was also on the saltier side, but it was good. The Beef Panang Curry was very salty & my family ended up leaving the majority of it uneaten. Out of the 3 entrees, my family enjoyed the dragon eggs the most and I would recommend them to new customers. However, next time, I would order the dragon eggs with the sauce on the side and dip them into the sauce to control the saltiness. Service was wonderful. Our waitress was attentive & kept refilling our water.",

The curry was fantastic with just a slight kick and packed with flavor.  YUM",

Downtown Phoenix has amazing restaurants, and this one is conveniently off Central, south of Thomas.   Service: mixed. The hostess let us choose a seat on the patio and was very friendly. Dinner service was not very friendly and pretty short, not totally uncommon at Asian food restaurants, but this was pretty curt. Patio service was very sporadic and we frequently found ourselves needing water or other items and there were no servers in site for ten minutes.  Food: we started with the Satay platter, which came with two chicken and beef skewers, and two pieces of shrimp. The temperature wasn't hot enough when it was served and the peanut sauce was heavy, but the overall taste was fine.  Dinner entrees were the chicken pad Thai and gai katchu. The pad Thai was just delicious, served in a huge portion with crisp sprouts and boys of peanuts. It could have used just a tad bit more heat, but hey, I live on the wild side.  The Gai Katchu was just as good, and we ordered it hot. It was definitely spicy, but had great flavor. Could have used more chicken.  Overall: The food was delicious for the most part, but we couldn't ignore the sub-par service.",

There is private parking but it's right next to a public lot and can be confusing. Beware to avoid parking in the public parking lot since it requires payment.   The restaurant itself has Asian inspired interior and appeared to be well maintained. They have a shady, quaint outdoor patio with normal table seating and also lounge seating. They have full table service for both indoor and out.   Customer service was mixed. One of our servers was a little short and wasn't helpful with the menu. Another one of our servers was very kind and attentive. The food was prepared very quickly so wait was minimal. The food itself was average. I enjoyed the flavors and thought the dishes were presented well. However, the flavor was average and the curry was served on a dish, which I think is mildly annoying since it's a bunch of fluid spread over a large surface area. The items come with a default spicy level but can be changed to cater your taste.",

We tried 3 different dishes their pineapple fried rice, spicy pad thai, dumplings and  and none were extraordinary mind blowing. Their Milk Boba was average. They have a boba drink made with coconut milk and almond milk. That was probably my favorite part. The parking is a little sketchy, it's behind the building.   This place is in downtown Phoenix and this area looks like a ghost town on the weekends.",

We asked to sit outside (plenty of tables). After 45 minutes, they tell us they have a table inside for us. We remind them we wanted outside- another 15 minutes to wait. By now the place was not budy-- maybe like five other tables.  Once we are at the table, it takes 20 minutes to get water served. The waiter got two drink orders wrong.   We waited. And waited. No explanation, no apology. After AN HOUR sitting at the table, our food is finally delivered. My vegetarian meal had meat in it. Two of the meals had no serving usensils.   To top it all off, the food was just okay. I've had worse, but definitely not worth the 2.5 hours.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with my friend.   We got the dragon eggs for appetizers which were very similar in look and taste to Chinese dim sum Siu Mais. The appetizers came out a few minutes after we ordered them. They had jalapeno slices on top though in what appears to be soy sauce. We also ordered thai teas and I ordered an additional watermelon mojito. They were pretty good. The thai teas were good and not as sugary as what I usually get whenever I have a thai tea that has been drenched in creamer. The watermelon mojito was poured a little heavy which, is usually how I have my liquor and had chunks of watermelon in it. Very good. Then my order or chicken pad thai came after I downed my watermelon mojito.   The time between finishing the appetizers and mojito to when my food arrived was about 7 minutes during lunch time rush...actually pretty good since they were about full inside the restaurant. I'm pretty sure nobody wanted to sit outside in 107 degree weather. Pad thai was delicious but not spicy. It is on the menu as one pepper rating or medium spicy. I usually get thai hot but was pretty hung over from heavy drinking into the morning so I figured getting thai hot was probably not a good idea.   Over all, a very good experience. Service was fast. Food was delicious and waitress was attentive. Pricing isn't bad but not like super cheap. I would come here again. Parking is decent and in back of the restaurant. I would imagine that during lunch time that parking might be tough to find since you technically can't park in the lot to the left of the restaurant...technically, lol.",

They don't seem to be very attentive. You may be seated right away, but it will take awhile to be waited on and receive your food or asked if there is anything you need. The place is always hot and uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the food is good enough and is conveniently located to work, that the probability of me returning is pretty high. The place can get crowded during lunch which is understandable being in central Phoenix.",

For the most part they are pretty consistent. From the outside you'd never guess that the inside was actually classy looking. Dimly lit with very dark furniture. Inside has an upscale feel though the outside looks pretty busted.  My two favorite lunch time orders are yellow chicken curry and pad Thai. Followed closely by the beef panang. And while I've had better, the convenience of this place can't be beat. The staff is always friendly on the phone and in person.  Cheers for Thai Fridays!",

The parking lot is rather small, we were lucky it wasn't too busy. I can imagine it would be difficult to find parking if it was a busy night.   When you first enter, you have the option of dining inside (to your left) or outside on the covered patio (right). We decided to sit outside since it was such a lovely evening. I ordered an iced Thai coffee - which was delicious. For an appetizer, my husband ordered the Dragon Eggz - dumplings with pork. These came out promptly and were tasty. For dinner, I ordered the Ginger Fish - breaded salmon with mushrooms, pineapple, onions, etc in a ginger sauce. Big mistake. The salmon was more breading than fish and was swimming in the sauce - which I didn't particularly care for. It was a disappointment, but I'd like to come back and try something different since so many other Yelpers seem to enjoy this restaurant.",

I saw our very friendly waitress approach her manager who was clearly annoyed by the question  (we made eye contact more than once). The waitress came back and said she was really sorry but they can't do anything about the wait because everyone else is waiting too. So we canceled our order, and they made us pay for the tea we drank! Now I know it wasn't much but when I've had a problem like this at other restaurants, the manager always comes over to the table and hears the grievance personally. The wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off. So we drove all the way to Siam Thai (which was pretty busy) and had an excellent meal which was served promptly.",

    "text": "Eeeeee. Long yet important message to follow!!  If I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.  The first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good.   This time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor.   The hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess.  Curry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing.   The waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. \"I'll be back\" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie.  Well waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.    Then I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced.  So in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!!   Anyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.  Still Wait Ing  Oh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there.   Sad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool.... Maybe she should own the place? Winning!   And I'm out!",

    "text": "Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, \"it's good...for the area,\" but this place is just plain good. I'm a pretty serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places. That being said, I'm definitely going to be a repeat customer at Wild Thaiger.  My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out for Life when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy I couldn't get a table somewhere.   We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend to anyone. It's open yet cozy and comfortably cool.   For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious and really unique.   For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect for the \"True Thai foodie.\" With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy and flavorful. I'd caution anyone not familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. I could've taken a bath in it. Long story short: it was SO good.   I'll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!",

My favorite item is the 24 K curry, which is a spicy green curry that features some delicious veggies (japanese eggplant that is melt in your mouth (probably the best eggplant I've ever had... I don't typically like eggplant), squash, and green beans). I usually add chicken and have more than enough food for two meals. Wild Thaiger has decent specials on some nights of the week for drinks (Mondays feature 5$ martinis). My only complaint about the Thaiger is that, unlike other Thai restaurants, they do not allow you to choose your spiciness level. I understand that some dishes may be better spicy or mild, but I would like to have the option available. I would say that Wild Thaiger is the best Thai food I have had in the downtown area and would recommend it.",

    "text": "My husband and I moved away years ago but when ever we are in town we eat here. Wild Thaiger has remained almost exactly the same ( please change your pad Thai back, it was way better when you got all 3 proteins instead of a choice). In SF this place would be 3 or 4 times the price and not have the patio seating. My favorite dish is the beef panang. The curry is thick and not at all watery like you get at other places. I also love the spice. Definitely get the jasmine iced tea to cool your pallet. Their lunch specials are also an amazing value. Always choose the soup. It's so good! I wish they would take down the Guy poster but I guess that's a big deal in AZ. In SF he's is Known as a racist homophobe.",

Arrived to the restraunt, which is walking distance from the Hilton Phoenix Suites, and the place was packed inside so my friend and I decided to eat on the patio. It was hot out but the patio is covered and has ceiling fans with a light mist so the heat wasn't much of a factor in our sitting.   I ordered the veggie spring rolls and the vegetable and tofu Pad Thai with the Thaigers Milk Boba to drink.  Veggie spring rolls were perfectly crisp and fresh with minimal grease. (My friend prefenced the chicken sping rolls and raved about them.) The veggie Pad Thai came out separated for you to mix. I am very picky as how much sauce comes in a dish and I personally felt the sauce to food ratio was right on the mark. The Boba drink was awesome. Not too sweet and punch of coconut flavor, which I love coconut everything.   My expierience was on the higher end of good. Ticket came out to $22.64 and I had to take food home. You can't go wrong for choosing this place.",

The 24k vegetarian curry has the best presentation I've seen at a Thai restaurant and is filed with tasteful spices. There coconut rice is also a must try. Would recommend",

I owe a bit of thanks to DDD for this as we do like to try the places we see not only on that show, but others.    We started with what DDD raved about; the Dragon's Egg's were out of the park outstanding!  Just perfect with the slice of jalapeno.  The waitress was spot on with her suggestions and the Peanut Passion was a good place to start for my girlfriend.  I sampled her dish and the peanut sauce was exactly what I expected, not too salty and a bit sweet.  The carrots were a bit off, however.  I had the Phuket Fantasea.  You could season with spice to your own palate which, I was courteous and let my girlfriend have a go before I spiced it up.    The wait was a bit long, but reading some of the other comments, it's to be expected.  Not to mention, they were fairly busy for a Sunday evening!  All in all, outstanding and next spring training, we will no doubt be making a return!",

I have had this in other places but they can't hold a candle to these guys.  My entree was the Peanut Passion.   Thin sliced, perfectly cooked chicken with a nice peanut sauce on a bed of fresh cooked veggies with a nice amount of white rice.... I just ate and my mouth is watering.  The knocks?  The dirty martini was poorly constructed and the bar top was a bit dirty.   I would not take a star off though because this is 6 star on a 5 star scale.

The service is pretty dismal - the hostess stand is like a revolving door - with most hostesses not lasting long.... The wait staff is equally bad, with the exception being Nate & the hardworking buser (a young girl). The kitchen is staffed by a very small staff led by the owner. The food is consistent & pretty good but be prepared to wait! (Usually 20+min after you are seated)",

They cannot change the heat level of the 24k, which was disappointing but understandable. My daughter got the curry chicken, it was lovely!

I really wanted a shrimp entree, but they only had seafood entrees.  I asked our waiter, Nathan, who was very pleasant, and he had a great suggestion.  He was able to customize a dish for me that I loved.  Fried shrimp with yellow curry, Thai vegetables, and jasmine rice.  He called it Crispy SH M.K.  No idea what that means but when I return that's how I'm supposed to order it.  The vegetables consisted of eggplant, Thai pumpkin, and green beans.  It was spicy, but I loved it.  For an appetizer, we had the satay sampler with shrimp, beef, and chicken. The satay sauce was delicious.  And, of course, a glass of Thai iced tea.  Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.  Can't wait to go back!!",

As you're traveling North on Central, you have to pass the restaurant and then take a quick right-hand turn into their parking area.  If you park in the lot South of the location you'll get towed.  Food was fantastic.  It was really, really fantastic.  Everything was fresh and natural.  they have quite a few gluten-free items as well, which was great to see.  Spring rolls were delicious.  Gluten-free Chicken Pad Thai was top-notch.  Chicken curry was downright delicious.  Price was right, and we did not leave hungry!  Their service was what knocked them down to 4 stars.  Reading the other reviews, I have to agree with what has been said before.  Place was empty at 11:30 AM on a Saturday and the service was SLOW and kind of \"space case.\"  The young lady who served us looked like a manga cartoon, to include hair and makeup, and if that is fashionable, that is great (I guess) but she sort of pulled an attitude with the gent who was also working that day.  Not sure if he was a server, but he was certainly stepping in because she wasn't up to par.  When he mentioned a concern from another table, she got a little snotty with him in front of us and several other customers.  If we're in the area we'll certainly stop by again.  Food was delicious, and NOT HOT AT ALL, which was great for us.  I understand that if you really want them to \"bring the heat\" all you have to do is ask, but our super-sensitive stomachs were MORE than pleased with the \"base-level\" spice.  We'll make sure to attend during a slow time, however, because if the service was that slow with only a few people in attendance I can't imagine how it is when the place is packed.",

Very bland and flavorless, I feel like I completely wasted my money. I highly recommend Thai lotus over this place any day. Not worth it at all.",

We arrived and were promptly seated and when our waitress asked for our drink choices, we also gave our orders (tofu veggie panang, beef panang, and tofu pad thai). It took about 20 minutes for our dishes to come out, since we arrived at noon and it was already busy. There were still a few empty tables and there is plenty of outdoor seating, which would be nice when the weather gets cooler. Everything looked great and it tasted even better. I loved my dish, the tofu panang. It was spicy enough and I liked the veggies and the sauce. The spring roll was tasty and it was a filling dish overall.   Our waters were filled often and service was good. I would go back and try other items on their menu. I usually order pad thai whenever I visit a Thai restaurant and I'm so glad I tried something else this time because it was delicious.",

Waited at the bar until my mother literally had to flag someone down for a drink menu after 15 minutes of going unnoticed. (there was a sign that said \"waiting only\" but 3 other people were seated at the bar wih drinks??)   There were several empty tables so I dont really understand their system or why we had such a ling wait. Finally got seated and ordered dragon eggs for an appetizer. Pretty tasty but nothing special. I did have to ask my waiter 3 times for a glass of water. I'm very patient but that's a bit ridiculous. When  I did get my water there was no apology.  Ordered coconut soup (they were out of the fuel to make the hot pot, well, hot). Broth was a bit thicker than I like and very sweet, and the amount of veggies in it was half of what I've received at other places. Their menu items are certainly interesting (wild boar and catfish) and watching the open kitchen was fun. But we literally felt ignored for a majority of our dining experience. Really wanted more from here...",

Prices are reasonable, service is friendly, portion size is generous, and the place is decorated tastefully inside with dark wood tones; the patio area is lovely with lots of seating and misters to help hydrate diners in the summer heat.  I have only visited a couple of times for lunch, so cannot comment on dinner service, but both of my lunch visits were delightful.  I had the tofu veggie panang on visit #1 and the tofu veggie yellow curry on visit #2 (I am trying to eat less meat for those who are wondering why I did not partake in the carnivorous options).  Loved both the red chili sauce (panang) and the yellow curry sauce; both were spicy enough with great flavour and came with your choice of soup or spring roll (I opted for the spring roll both times -- YUM!).  Lunch prices range from $8-10.  Go and visit the Thaiger!",

My friend and I went to check out the \"Wine Down Wednesday\" special, which means you can get any international wines for only $5 per glass (this is a great deal as they have some pretty awesome wines).   As for food last night, we shared an app and entree. We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! I love the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious chunks of crab, instead of the typical 95% cream cheese filling in most crab wontons. Awesome. For our 'entree' we had a special for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous!   In previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, beautifully presented and my personal favorite... tasted FRESH! I love that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. Fresh flavors, enough spice to taste (you can pick your level on most items), great flavor combos without going overboard - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors.   Last night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not harder then everyone else.",

In fact I didn't want to go back till thai Rama had that can plow in and we were at a loss. I'm most definitely glad I did go back and having said that I will keep going back .    Oh and btw that mango cheese cake is the truth. That is legit and I wonder how I went through life not hiking to mix up my fav 2 things mangoes and cheese !   Perhaps if they fix up their service I will up it to five stars until then it's a 4.5 place",

After we got the food, he checked on us once and disappeared.  We never saw him again.  A young woman brought the check after we flagged down yet another employee and asked.  Really, where were all the servers?    It was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear.  On one side was 4 * $6.50 for drinks but no drink total anywhere.  On the other side was our two entrees, each with a price, and then a grand total.  I like to check the bill so I calculated it and it was right, but why not list all the items ordered, then tax, then a total?    We were late for our game.",

When someone walks into your establishment the first thing you should do is greet them not carry on an internal conversation.

Hmmm when there are 2 seats at the bar I don't think a party of 3/4 or 5 is going to manage that. Then we were told to wait out in the patio where space heaters exist but not turned in. The patio could definitely be used for serving...lost revenue and no one sitting at the bar....more lost revenue.",

We ordered Thai iced teas, which took a while to arrive. I don't think our waiter thought the patio was pleasant.   My wife ordered the GF Pad Thai, our daughter ordered the Tofu Curry and I got Dragon Eggs and Phuket Fantasea. Lunch arrived after 25 minutes, a bit long for lunch.   The Pad Thai was good. All the elements were served apart from each other, so you could mix ingredients as you wish - nice touch. The Curry and Fantasea were both good as well.   The prices were fairly steep though. My Dragon Eggs (dumplings) were $9 and the Phuket Fantasea was $18. All-in-all, the bill was $60+ plus tip. That's a pricey lunch, even for Thai food.   I may try it again, going with less expensive dishes and hope for better service.",

    "text": "Writing this review after my second experience. The first time I had Wild Thaiger I went and ate there with a friend, the Dragon Balls are absolutely delicious, pad see ew was good but the extra charge for 3 medium shrimp was a little lame. Service was LESS THAN which was a bummer because the Owner/Chef was making rounds, with what seemed like regulars and she seemed super friendly and awesome. However, all the other servers looked like they truly hated their jobs, bummer.   I'm writing this as I am eating Dragon Balls from my couch at home. I had Wild Thaiger delivered via Postmates just now and I'm pretty bummed out. The Dragon Balls are great, can't say nothing bad about those! However, my pad see ew has absolutely no flavor, very, scary, bland. I have fish sauce here at home so I've covered it enough to have some flavor so far. I also did not have an option to choose the shrimp as my \"meat\" but I noted I would prefer it but thought it was weird that I could not get it togo? I received pork and it is bland and dry, not the least bit salted. Also, don't order the Beef Broccoli thinking it's the Chinese style Beef Broccoli, I didn't take the star off for the Beef Broccoli because, I'm aware this is a Thai restaurant, I'm Thai myself, but most Thai restaurants I have gone to serves beef broccoli chinese style, it's also very bland as well.   I'm really bummed out as I hesitated on which Thai place to order from near me and the first time it was good but this time around it's like a complete 180, the food really hurt my feelings lol, but seriously. I'm not one to complain but I'm contemplating calling to let the restaurant know because I don't feel like the $40 was worth anything I got. Really hope I can have this resolved in some way because I'm soo willing to try Wild Thaiger again to try different things and forever get Dragon Balls. I don't know tho =((((((((((((((((((",

So my brother and I were in the area and wanted some good dinner.  We never been to this place, but heard about it in the past on DDD.  So we wanted to give this place a try and came in on a Thursday night.  I have seen some reviews in the past about the bad customer service and on this night it was no different.  It was pretty busy and I noticed they only had two waitress, a bus boy and hostess that tried to accommodate the entire place.  They were hustling and tried their best, but clearly they were overwhelmed.  I didn't know if someone call in or what, but two waitresses covering inside and outside seemed to be a pretty tough task.   The food, cause that's what it's all about right?  Nothing really blew me away, honestly I have been to many places just as good, Sala Thai, Reign of Thai, and Thai Basil.  We ordered the Papaya salad, Pad Sie-ew, and full rack of Thaiger ribs.  The Papaya salad was small, but it was fresh and flavorful.  The Pad Sie-ew was ok, tasted like a Chinese style chow fun with vegetables.  The ribs I really wasn't a fan of.  They were braised and were completely falling off the bone.  I'm not a huge fan of that.  I think ribs should have a little bit and should hold up when you're eating it.  I took a bite of the rib and all the meat fell off.  Maybe cause I like ribs smoked, I just wasn't a fan.  Overall this place was just average.  Nothing special.  I know they were probably a little understaffed, but we never got our water or drinks refilled.  No one ever came by to check on us and we considered getting dessert, but it wasn't offered.  The food would have to been great for me to come back again.  Not a fan, probably will stick to the joints up north then venture down here again.  Maybe it was a off night, but a disappointing experience.",

I happened to go with some friends, one of whom ran her own Thai restaurant. She agreed the food was excellent. We had to ask for the spice rack which was fine. And then she doctored our pad see-ew with jalapeno vinegar and spices which was delicious. The dragon eggs in particular were fabulous. The satay, basil chicken, panang curry, and mango sticky rice were great as well. The only item we didn't enjoy was the Papaya salad which was missing fish sauce. I will be back!",

I ordered the Beef Panang and husband ordered a peanut chicken dish.  Both were delicious, the chicken was moist and flavorful, and the Panang had just the right amount of spice.  One of my main complaints with the local Thai eateries is that they generally do not provide much spicy kick, but Wild Thaiger knows how to pack the punch.  Definitely do not order the spicy dishes if you can't take the heat.",

The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure!",

    "text": "Recently went back with a party of 10 for a bday celebration. It was my pick, and I did consider how a party of ten could be a disaster in a small-ish, \"we're just a hole-in-the-wall that happens to be really popular\" place like WT. And sure enough, we arrive and wait in the tiny entry way for at least 10 min before being approached by anyone. In that time, a friend who had arrived early and staked out at the bar informed me that as soon as she sat down, she was told that she couldn't order food because the kitchen was temporarily shut down because they were too busy. At the time we arrived it was maybe 30 percent full, and she assured me that that had happened 30-40 minutes ago, so they should be back on track by now.  The host finally showed up and said she could seat us, but it would be a while before the server would take our order bc they were \"recovering.\" Well, that's better than 10 people blocking an entryway, so I'm not sure why she seemed hesitant to seat us, even if we had to wait for a server. She assured us that we could order drinks from our table until the kitchen was \"ready.\" It was only downhill from there. Thankfully, we were a jovial bunch - under any other circumstances this experience would have been disastrous. 15 min to get drink orders, another 15 to get the drinks. Another 20 min later he took our food orders. 30 min later they started coming out, sort of. Seven entrees came out, staggered over a period of five minutes. But three entrees - all pad thai - didn't arrive until at least 10 min later, when everyone else was finished. I understand not everyone can get food at exactly the same time with a party of 10, but they didn't even come close, and at the time we made our food orders it was at least an hour if not more after their alleged huge rush that shut down the kitchen.  I got the peanut chicken - grilled chicken with peanut sauce, rice and grilled veggies. The sauce was too citrus-y for a peanut sauce and too thick (funny that I complained in my first review that my curry was too thin). Chicken underneath was completely flavorless and was dry and veggies were scant. Good thing it was only $10. Didn't get details from anyone else except the BF, who got the Kao Pad Jay, and kept saying over \"I'm so glad I got this!\" All these issues seemed to be circumstantial (except the chicken dish), but, then again, how long has WT been a restaurant? Come on, I'm sure they've dealt with many a Saturday night rush and someone (ahem, manager??) should have at least come out to explain/apologize for their issues. Don't think I'll go back to dine in - ever.",

One unique feature to Wild Thaiger is that in addition to being a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai bar as well. They offer many Asian beers and Indochina-themed cocktails. They have seating indoors and out with a patio view of Central Avenue. The restaurant can be a bit easy to miss, especially for those used to Phoenix' usual parking-in-front cityscape, as it is in an older part of the city with the parking lot through an alley, behind the building. The food is delicious and the drinks are really good.",

To ppl that post bad reviews because it took 10 mins to get your cocktail or whatever-shut up! Go to a \"dead\" Thai restaurant. There's a reason Wild Thaiger is busy. Because its fuckn bomb!!",

Waitress was nice and quick with the drinks for it being busy. Had the chicken spring rolls for an appetizer and they were deliciously crunchy, they come in orders of 4. For dinner I had the Kimow and it was also very good as it wasn't too dry, but just right. The beer selection could be a little better, but it is not bad. A lot of Asian beers. Also had a glass of mango juice that was alright, nothing special. All in all, if I were to come back to Phoenix and this area, I would come back to eat at this restaurant!",

Sadly thaiger did not out enough on. It was like putting on black pepper. Next time I will request lots of soice because the combination of flavors they use is exquisite. This place could do better and has so much potential to live up to...your competition is Ewa's in Flagstaff",

The wait was reasonable, at least from an east coast point of view, 18 min, but I heard a few impatient comments from those around me. regional standards must apply. Table service was a bit slow, and she forgot to bring the appetizers that she had herself recommended. I reminded her after our entrees appeared, so they comp'd them reasonable. The Salmon was overcooked and dry, but the chicken dish was good. Seasoning seemed a bit light, the other flavors need to come through the heat. Drink refills were greatly delayed and resulted in lost sales for them and frustration for us. Over all, good food at an elevated price with moderate service. I would go back, but at off peak times to see if it is just volume which stresses the team there.",

However in the last few months the service has deteriorated. Long wait times for a server to pay any attention to you making every meal feel long and drawn out. On our most recent visit this evening it took forever to be acknowledged when we walked in. After we were sat it took another 10 minutes before our server came over. Other than the slow service the food runner/ bus girl with a bad attitude had her pants riding so low that at first we could see her butt crack, later she was flaunting her thong. I'm pretty sure if I wanted a strip tease I would have gone to bandaids down the street, not wild Thaiger.",

When the server finally comes to your table, its a struggle to make them understand what you want to eat, the restaurant would benefit from hiring servers who can communicate in English. After a long day at work, you dont want to spend 20 mins to help the serer understand your order. Also, they offer little room to customize your order as compared to other Thai restaurants. You can't customize how spicy u want your curry or if you want less veggies and more sauce in your curry or of you dont want chicken on your noodle, no other Thai restaurant has this problem to my knowledge.... I have been sitting here for for 20 mins now and the server hasn't served us water yet. They would do well to make the customer feel a little more welcoming.",

I ordered something called like peanut passion (I love peanut curry and peanut sauce) and I ordered it with soft tofu instead of chicken (I thought I would grow feathers if I had more chicken).  The flavor was OK but I already forgot it.  What I liked the most, they have parking, they have a great patio (I guess October through March would be a nice place to be) and the Arnold Palmer with the green tea.  The prices are fair.

    "text": "In the land where many of the Thai restaurants simply rotate proteins, carbs and a standard vegetable medley, Wild Thaiger dishes out more authentic versions of traditional Thai specialties.  I'm a huge fan, especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique and colorful profiles and textures.  It's an adventure.  Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) and Thai Elephant (good but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings similar to shu mai, graced with a spicy slice of raw jalapeno on top.  Decha Boar celebrates the not often served wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  They understand that pepper can be flavorful in addition to hot, and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  Best of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat it should be to dine out.  If you are looking for standard Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse and grace.  Yum to the freakin' yum.",

I argued with the woman over fish paste, and she said the fish paste had wheat in it...and it was in the pad thai, yet the pad thai was gluten free? EEK. If you're a celiac, be careful and just go through the ingredients of what you want to order.   The hot tea was amazing, and they offer the honey sugar packets - great!

The curry is definitely spicy, but it's the good spicy you're probably looking for if you want Thai.  The spring rolls were crispy and delicious and came with a sweet-spicy dipping sauce.  The portions were great - neither too small, nor a ton of wasted leftovers.  When I walked in to pick up the order, I was pleasantly surprised: black tables and chairs, nice table settings (complete with linen napkins and wine glasses), a very nice bar setting (great for eating alone), and plently of booths, \"typical\" tables, and high-top tables.  The kitchen is behind the bar, and you can pretty much see everything going on back there, so there's no question about cleanliness or sketchy food preparation.

It's extremely delicious Thai food, if slightly difficult to get a table if you are a group of 8 or more (understandable...) Pad thai + curries are excellent. Ambiance = extrememly fun. Hot sauce and peppers = extrememly available.  The drinks here are HIGHLY recommended. Lychee + Gin Martinis. YES YES YES YES YES. I'm not sure why I havent started making this at home.   I had my union going away party here on the patio. So awesome in the fall and winter!  Oh also the staff is awesome. Not only are the waitresses EXTREMELY attractive but also very nice and always remembered our big gang of fools.",

I like everything from the tables and booths to the patio.  It is easy to hang out and have a good meal with friends, or to tuck yourself away in a corner...  The service has always been top notch for me.  I have been there when I was in a hurry, and I was able to eat and run without having to beg for service.  I also have had long leisurely dinners and was always happy with the attentive, but not pushy service.  I LOVE their pad thai.  It's a little different from the other places I have gone, in a good way.  I'm only sorry they have had such a time with the construction outside their door.  a nice place doesn't deserve that hassle.",

    "text": "The general consensus that Thaiger is worth a 4 -- so True. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal, but wasn't lickin the sauce off my plate for more.   The interior is very intimate and you can view the chefs cookin up your meals behind the bar (I hear it gets hot if you're sitting in that area). By 6:30p on a random Tues. night it was busy. Service was prompt and friendly, and everything that my friends and I ordered happened to be suggestions from the waitress herself.  We started with the Satay Sampler that included beef, chicken and shrimp. Excellent presentation and meat, but since I'm not a giant fan of peanut sauce, this app. was just so-so.   Kristin R. got the Holy Basil Chicken, which we all agreed was the best choice. The sauce of this stir-fry like dish is truly what made it *pop*. Even on a hot night, eating something warm like this just felt comforting. Not too overpowering, just the right amount of kick to it. Chris C. got the Pla Duk Grapao, catfish covered in a similar sauce as the Holy Basil. Yum as well, and cooked just right so the fish flaked well. Lastly, I got the Beef filet & Green Papaya Salad. The filet was very thin and cooked well, yet I can't see myself fully enjoying it w/o the green chili the sauce that came on the side (make sure you dip into this one). The green papaya salad was def a hit for me. The papaya is shredded so finely that it appears to be noodle-like. It's very summer-like, while having a definite spice to the chili dressing its soaked in.   Loved their homemade Thai Iced Tea as well (they prepared it there I noticed, as the cream was still separated when brought out), and want to come back in the future to try one of their hot pot soups.  Great recommendation from my coworker!",

Not that big of a deal except for our table sat empty for 15 to 20 minutes before they actually sat us at the table and the restaurant was not full. When they sat us, it was a good 15 minutes before anyone came over to us. It took us another 20 minutes to get water and once they finally took our order 3 appetizers came out along with the first person's dinner. There are 8 of us total and over the course of the next 15 minutes a dinner here and a dinner there came out. The 8th dinner came out when the rest of us were completely done. Our server thought the way to handle this was bt cracking jokes and buying a drink for that a person, not taking care of his dinner. Poorly handled from start to finish. And on top of it all the food was meh at best.  My first visit will definitely be my last and I won't recommend to the place to anyone ever. Too bad, because I've heard good things about this place. And for the record I post positive reviews regularly and negative reviews rarely.",

I felt always being treated bad and had to wait for my order or food for 30-40 min even when I call ahead.   So tonight I waited for 30 min the waitress never came and then I went to her she said she was told the manager said not to serve me and she should be afraid of my kind of people. I'm middle eastern and brownish.   I was so hurt the waitress With the blue hair laughed and said the manager can serve anyone they like. The other waitress made a mistake and showed me a note on with my name on it stating not to serve me or my people !!  what they don't know is I order for my staff once or twice a week over 200$ but I always have someone else pick it up. NEVER AGAIN   VERY HURTFUL    RACISM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN 2018.   Very sad. I will not ever support this establishment and I hope you  don't either.   Racist people come in all shape and ethnicities.

The soup of the day was egg drop soup and it was really gross - bad after taste like dirt, so didn't end up eating it.

    "text": "We were craving Thai food and we saw that this place was on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives so we were excited to give it a try. It was a busy Thursday night dinner and the floor was extremely understaffed -- the hostesses were cleaning/rearranging tables and delivering check to customers in between seating people. Granted, the place is small, but there were only two other actual servers taking orders and running the entire floor. This was just the beginning of a sadly disappointing night here.  We ordered the fresh rolls for an appetizer, chicken pad Thai and the Thaiger Ribs with Thai tea. The fresh rolls came out quickly and while I thought it was a generous serving size for an appetizer and for the price, the fresh rolls were bland. The side sauce that came with it was overdone and was outside the traditional peanut sauce that usually comes with it. The rest of our food came 25 mins after our appetizer came out, which we thought was a little long but we waited patiently anyway. This pad Thai was very much forgettable -- in fact, it lacked flavor. It came in a huge, beautifully presented plate but there was nothing more to it. The Thaiger ribs were overdone to the point that the meat was tough and hard to chew. Again, the side sauce that came with it was unfitting and did not complement the BBQ sauce of the ribs.  We didn't finish our meals and were very disappointed. We had to get the staff's attention so we could get our checks and leave, which still added another 10-15 mins. The only reason I'm not giving this place a one star is because the few staff that we encountered on the floor were great even if they were under extreme stress. I probably would not come back here again.",

I ended up throwing them away (outside, in the dumpster).   The mango sticky rice is small and doesn't have much mango for $7. The chicken pad Thai is edible, flavor is good but not what I would expect pad Thai to taste like. Mi Dang had a good underlying flavor but mushy / not pleasant to eat. Might have been better if eaten in the restaurant. The Fat One was dry, not flavorful or spicy like it said it was. My total was roughly $62 and absolutely not worth it. Pretty disappointed and I won't go back",

There was two other parties in the restaurant when we arrived for lunch on a Saturday, and by the time we ordered another 4 parties had arrived.  Right off the bat our waitress seemed impatient and not very friendly, which isn't a good start to anyone's experience. I didn't see anyone else on the floor so she must've been the only one waiting on the tables.  We started off with some veggie and chicken rolls-- which were nothing memorable. My dish was the pad Thai which again, nothing that id recommend or come back for. It lacked in flavor, and had some sort of dry pepper flakes on it which I've never had before whenever ordering this familiar dish.   The other two dishes that were ordered at my table were decent in flavor but nothing special.   At least the ice tea was pleasant!  I've come to assume the hype is all from Triple D, otherwise... I just don't get it?",

After a quick Yelp search I found Wild Thaiger who has a decent vegetarian and gluten free menu.   I ordered the yellow curry with tofu, veggies and brown rice. OMG!!!! It was sooooo good. It cost extra to substitute white rice with brown. Not sure why it's an extra cost but whatever. I ordered it from the list of lunch specials. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because their lack of vegetarian soup options. The lunch specials include soup and egg roll. Well, there should be a non meat based soup for your vegan and vegetarian customers. That being said, I will most certainly return and get the exact same meal!!",

The hostess informed our party that the restaurant was short staffed and we would have a ten minute wait. No problem. We are patient. With no other patrons waiting to be seated, we requested to sit at a table and would have no concerns about waiting for service while we rested our legs and chatted. We were refused.  In 103 degree heat, we were refused. They were unwilling to allow us to sit inside at an empty table to wait! We questioned this action and the hostess turned to the kitchen, then looked back and said she was not allowed to let us inside.  We were left with the option of standing in the heat while tables remained empty inside, or we could find a place that was willing to accommodate our party. We chose the latter.   I'm sorry that I will never have the opportunity to review the food here. Even more, I am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling. The only interaction with the restaurant that I have to review- a refusal to allow us to sit at an empty table.",

Chef and owner Olashawn Hasadinratana-Weaver brings the traditional flare of Thai food to modern day Phoenix.  Wild Thaiger has had many TV personalities visit the place, but also celebrities that come by PHX.  I know because of the pictures posted in the back wall - haha!  Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.    I've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.  Overall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.  Their selection of Thai beer is always interesting something I think you need to try for you beer connoisseurs out there.  Service is always tops and the kitchen which is open for your viewing is spotless - Enjoy!",

Food was a little slow - but they had a LARGE table - I'm sure that stressed their resources a bit.  We used the time to catch up - so all is good.   I'd much rather receive fresh, hot, tasty food than something thrown together in a hurry just to meet a speed need.  You can tell by watching the kitchen that each dish is cooked to order.    Two of us ordered the Pad Thai, one a beef salad, and the other a peanut chicken dish.  EVERYONE was pleased with their selection.  I like mine a little spicier - and the condiment jars provided just what I wanted.  We also shared the Island Crab appetizer - and ordered a second!    Just like Arnold... I'll be back!",

My only suggestion is I needed to be given a spoon so I could enjoy every drop of my ginger sauce.  The perfect mango cheesecake I ordered inspired my friends to get their own slice.  The service was excellent especially since she helped my friends get a proper introduction to Thai food.  Parking behind the restaurant was available at lunchtime.

The sauce was tangy with some sweetness that was offset perfectly with the jalapeno slices.  As I do with a new Thai spot, I opted for the Pad Thai with chicken, my friend got the panang curry with a mix of beef and chicken. The Pad Thai was honestly one of the best I've ever had, and hands down the best in Phoenix. It was spicy, the noodles were sticky and delicious. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The presentation was impeccable,  The panang curry was not what either of us are used to as it was red opposed to the normal green, but it was super smooth, almost smoky and crazy flavorful. It wasn't clumpy and very creamy. The only downside was the $2 charge to sub brown rice for the traditional jasmine rice.  I would highly recommend Wild Thaiger to anyone town.",

The pad thai noodles were also awesomely chewy and came with tons of mix-ins on the side like peanuts, cabbage, bean sprouts, beets, and cilantro.  A bit too much sauce was on the noodles today, but adding the veggies really helped.  Next time I'm hoping to try the durian ice cream as well ;p",

This would be fine if they didn't have 5 empty \"reserved\" tables. (In fact, we were told there was no where to even wait and when we tried to order a beer at the bar, we were told that someone might be able to get it in 5-10 minutes. After 15 minutes we gave up and went outside without so much as a water.) The hostess let us know several times that they were understaffed, but with only 12 tables and 4 waitstaff it shouldn't have been an issue.  40 minute of standing around and they finally pulled together two open tables and sat our \"large party\" of 5. They then proceeded to tell us that it would \"be a while\" until someone would be out to take our order, and no they wouldn't be able to take our drink orders now. Then, we had to watch while our server took orders from a party of 13 who weren't even completely seated yet! At this point, we took the hint and headed over to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe!! I don't care if they are featured on every food network show, until they figure out how to run a restaurant (and lose the attitude) we won't be back!",

They used to be a solid 5 star Thai source back when they opened, but now about half the food is really really good and the other half is not really good. Their Pad Thai used to be the best ever by a fair bit, now it is just sweet and doesn't even have peanuts on it (last couple of trips at least). The barbecue was OK, but the green chile dipping sauce it came with was exceptional.  Still AWESOME - - Beef Panang, Pad Kee Mau (spicy coconut milk chicken soup). All their curries have been awesome to my memory. I used to take joy in trying new things here, now I am more cautious.  I hear there is a Scottsdale location now, but I think I will stick with the original.",

    "text": "As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!  Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.  Their other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.  Their Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.  The service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.  One day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!",

The first 10 people arrived and were not seated and was told that all the parties needed to be present.  Waited 45-60 mins standing outside until the rest of the group arrived. Finally when the rest of the group arrived the Mngr then said we have to wait a lot longer and needed to be seated by groups, \"broken up\" since there were too many of us. There were only few people inside. The kitchen could not handle the large numbers all at one time per mngr, though there were enough empty tables for all of us. It did not make any sense why we cannot order our food  while waiting for the rest of the group to arrived. Once we're all there, She will not seat us because  our group was \" too large\"! Where is the LOGIC here? We ended up leaving and discovered CheryBlossomsCafe not too far from this place which was Awesome! Combination of Japanese/Thai&Korean food.All 21 of us enjoyed the food @ CherryBlossomsCafe and will NEVER go back nor recommend Wild Thaiger!",

    "text": "Well...mixed bag!  Went with a buddy on a Wednesday night and the place seemed to be hopping...maybe a bit too busy as the service was pretty bad.  We were seated right away, but waited 15 minutes for a waiter.  Appetizer arrived fairly promptly, but there was nearly a 30 minute wait after the appetizer was cleared for main courses to arrive.    We had the Vegie Sampler as an appetizer and it was incredibly delicious - I'd go back just to order that dish!  Crispy/crunchy corn fritters, big chunks of seared tofu (which sounds sort of nasty to a meat-eater like me but was incredible!) with peanut sauce, and crispy fried vegie rolls.  This dish was the only real winner - and was way over the top with flavor!  My buddy had a tofu/vegie dish - I wish I knew what it was exactly - but on the menu it had a single pepper on it.  He ate half of it and was beading with sweat, so beware that even a \"medium heat\" dish can get pretty hot.  I asked for a vegie/chicken dish - something \"healthy\" and was told about a dish with a soy and garlic sauce.  The chicken and vegies were fairly good (a bit heavy on the cauliflower maybe) but the sauce just tasted \"off\" - not like soy/garlic at all and was odd enough that I didn't finish the dish either.  It wasn't flavorful - it didn't taste like I'd had it described - and it didn't compliment the rest of the dish.   Both of our issues with main courses are probably more personal preferences but there's also room for improvement maybe in how the dishes were described to us.  I had a ginger martini and my buddy had a very tall mai tai ($6 - which was a good deal for the large glas!).  So...hit and miss...but I will try it again.",

The hostess says to wait and runs into the kitchen to talk to a woman putting take out food into bags, she slowly comes back and says \"we're understaffed and it will be about 10min before a waiter can get to us\". I said that's fine, and asked can we just go sit at the empty table of four then and we'll wait. She looked at me like I said something foreign and refused and said no. I said we can't be seated at the empty table for our party? At this point I'm getting mad and say to her I don't understand why you're refusing to seat us and can wait but you want us to stand in front of the hostess desk. I said never mind, we're leaving, never have been refused to be seated before. She didn't answer, gave me a dirty look and we walked out. I've never experienced anything like that. It's not my fault your understaffed on a weekend, you could have easily seated us with no problem. Absolute horrendous customer service. I've been to your place many times and will not be returning after that.",

This restaurant to had decent Thai food and the service was just ok. That would have been fine had the waiter not taken the liberty of changing the amount of the tip I indicated on my Visa receipt. When I reviewed my statement online and discovered he had done that, I printed the statement and took it and the receipt (as proof) back to the restaurant to explain what happened to the manager. The manager refunded my entire tip in cash. Some would say that should have solved it, but for some reason the manager's reaction to the incident wasn't what I had hoped for. It felt more like he wanted me to simply go away with cash rather than regain my confidence as a customer. I went with what it felt like. Haven't been back and will likely NEVER return.",

The person I was with ordered the ginger fish - mediocre at best, although it looked great with a variety of vegetables and pineapple.  I felt the dishes looked better than they actually tasted.  The seafood (mussels, calamari, salmon, shrimp) in my dish was very fresh but it wasn't Thai hot at all.  The ambiance of their patio was enjoyable and the Thai iced tea was very tasty although a little too sweet towards the end.  Overall, I will probably give this restaurant another try in the future but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of the food.",

I noticed how small the kitchen is and how they do not clean up immediately after themselves.  Some dishes are really good while others are really bad.  Any substitutions and there is a charge.  Not very friendly at all when you can charge someone $2 for peanut sauce with their meal or $1 to add onions or remove bellpeppers.  It is just a real hit or miss here.",

I don't doubt that the service is usually better too, but it was clear they were short-staffed for whatever reason the night I went, so the it took longer to order than I would have liked.  I ordered the Kimow, which is a dish I have been looking for on the menus of various Thai restaurants in AZ, but have never been able to find. Needless to say, I was excited! Alas, at the arrival of my food, I was disappointed. It was a small portion for paying 10 dollars, but I will say it was tasty.   It is starting to get hot now and the evening's cold air was starting to set in, so we sat outside, which was nice. Inside looked clean and the booths are rather private, which is neat.   My biggest complaint was the layout of the menu itself. This may sound kind of stuck up, but it really made a difference to me. It is kind of scattered looking and the selection, as it is presented, appears small. Plus, the menu doesn't obviously inform the customer that all their specialties and items that say they're made with this or that meat, can actually be replaced with another meat or tofu (if you're vegan or vegetarian like me).   Needless to say, I always value trying new restaurants, especially of my favorite cuisine. Wild Thaiger, unfortunately, probably won't be one of those places I insist on going to when I go to Phx though. Like I said, it'll satisfy, but it pretty mediocre.",

We had to wait 45min for our seafood panang curry and pad thai while the table next to us that seated 10min after us got their appetizer, soup and main dish before us.  One waiter seemed to be doing everything from being in the kitchen to serving food to asking how things are and working the cash register (he was awesome!).

We started off with some Thai beers, trying out a couple of recommendations, and a variety of starters.  That was the easy part, picking something to eat was a terribly hard decision, everything looked amazing.    Lucky for us, with 5 people, everyone picked something different.  I had the best Beef Panang EVAR!  The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  The jasmine rice was the perfect base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly cooked.  I love curry and spice, but I want to taste the food too, and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor.  For my mom, who can't eat spicy stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled to get something that tasted great.  Most of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed that this was very authentic.  They even brought out a nice traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.  Everything I tried, I liked and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not get bored!  I just wish it could hit them up on my lunch.  They are also right off the light rail line, which makes it much easier for a Chandler girl to get to - no worries about traffic or parking.",

Ola takes great pride in all her creations and  is usually always there  right along side  her gifted  team.  I could not end this review  without  giving  kudos to the talented wait staff  who are all  great but  I gotta give a special shout out to M & A  !",

I haven't had too much experience with Thai food, but we thought their Pad Thai, and Red Curry dish (vegetarian) was very good. The owner, Ola, is a very nice, pleasant, and humble person.  Another shout out for their Thai Iced Tea WITH boba! I've been craving this ever since!! We also had their homemade mango cheesecake. It was amazing especially with the mango sauce drizzled on top.",

    "text": "Having just moved apartments and being too lazy to take my dishes out of a box which was stacked under 6 more boxes (hey, I'm tired), I decided to head out for the the late afternoon/evening to explore the 'hood and end with a good bite to eat. Sure, I moved less than a mile from where I used to live, but anyway...  After running around doing a bunch of stuff, I thought about grabbing some Thai food. I've driven by Wild Thaiger a number of times but hadn't eaten there yet. So, today was the day.  Given that I was dining solo tonight, I brought a book to read. I went in and the place was packed. I told the hostess I'd rather sit outside on the patio since it was more quiet. So I sat around and waited for a while as I was listening to, well, Arabic pop music wafting through the speakers (don't get me wrong, I like Arabic music a lot, but at a Thai restaurant?). 5 minutes later the hostess came back out with my water. But it was10 minutes after that which my server finally showed up. Strike number one.  I ordered the Wild Wrap (spicy diced chicken that you eat by rolling it up in cabbage leaves) and the Holy Basil Chicken. About 15 minutes later the appetizer came. The server then promptly left without giving me any napkin or other utensils. Strike two.   I walked back inside and flagged down a different waitress to ask for napkins. She looked at me funny. I told her, \"Hey, the other guy didn't give me any napkins, what can you do?\"   So I ate the Wild Wrap. Not so great. I've had much better elsewhere (namely San Francisco). Still edible, but I wasn't really enjoying it. 10 minutes later the waiter came with the holy basil chicken.   \"You don't have any utensils?\"  \"No, you didn't give me any.\"  \"Oh.\"  So instead of the paper napkin the other waitress gave me, I finally get a cloth napkin with a fork and knife. I'm now sitting hoping the dish is going to be worth all this waiting and extraneous trouble.  It wasn't.   The sauce was alright, I guess, but the chicken pieces were dry and I'd give the whole dish just 3 stars. Throughout this entire time no one came outside once to check on how I was doing or to refill my water. I was beginning to get bad flashbacks to my Autumn Court experience. Strike three. Wild Thaiger was out.  5 minutes after I finished the waitress came out to refill my water (um, I'm done) and told me she'd go get my check. No \"Would you like dessert?\" because apparently single guys with books don't eat dessert. The waiter comes out 5 minutes later with the bill and gives a super friendly thank you. Uh, thanks for being nice and all now, but this is the first time I've seen you since you put the plate on my table.   I don't know if because I brought a book with me that these people summed up that \"he must be a lousy tipper so we don't need to pay much attention to him.\" WRONG. I'm a great tipper if and when I get good service. For whichever reason I was ignored, though, my tip's going to reflect that.  As is my Yelp review.   SUMMARY: Food was ok. Not all too special. I've had better Thai food with a lot more choices on the menu at other restaurants in the Phoenix metro. Regardless of the food, the service wasn't a winner. Maybe I should wear an Armani suit next time around.",

    "text": "This was my first and last experience at Wild Thaiger and I will not be going back. Ever. The service was unacceptable. From the moment my friend and I entered the restaurant the experience was bad. In hindsight, I should have walked out after our issues with the hostess. She repeatedly asked us where we would like to sit, or how many people were in our party, and then she would walk away while we answered or disregard that we had answered her at all. It was like she was incapable of absorbing information. We finally got seated. The table behind us very loudly cancelled their order paid for their drinks and left stating that the service taking too long. The writing was on the wall. At first, I felt like those people were incredibly rude, but now I wish that I had left too rather than enduring a total lack of service.  It took a long time for us to get water or our drinks. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our drinks, the appetizer took 45 minutes to arrive, the waiter forgot that we had ordered anything at all, came back to the table to confirm the appetizer TWICE and still brought us the wrong item and then had the nerve to charge us for it! I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left.  The restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness. I found the menu to be limiting, and the items lacked enough description. I will never go back. I have no idea how it had such good reviews.",

But when we turned up the heat it was much better. You must try the 24K pumpkin curry which has a very rich and flavorful sauce. Drink the coconut cove cocktail if you love coconut water - it's SO refreshing if your sitting on the hot patio. Also, the pad Thai is a bit sweet so ask for limes to squeeze into it. Enjoy!",

The restaurant has a huge patio facing Central Ave and the inside is decorated very tastefully. They have a nice selection of wines, specialty cocktails, and beer ( mostly Asian imports ).   My husband and I ordered :  The Temple of the Thaiger- delicious and described as a party in your mouth, and it was. Perfectly seasoned chicken layered on fried won tons.  Satay Sampler- This was shrimp, chicken, and beef covered in a peanut sauce and was very yummy.  Freshie Rolls- we had the chicken and the veggie and both were soooooo good, this is a must try !  Jasmine rice- steamed to perfection.  All food is made to order and is fresh and delicious. This is a family owned and operated business with Thai born chefs that really know what they're doing. It is a little pricey for Thai food, but the quality and flavor make it worth it. They also have several lunch specials for $7.95 from 11-2 Monday thru Friday.",

Although the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun, a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff.  The menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super cool and much appreciated as it's more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in \"ethnic\" cooking.  The vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items.  I didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that.  All in all, a great experience.",

No complaints on anything we had.   Wonderful food - creative, great flavors, artful presentation.  Helpful waitstaff - with a shellfish allergy, navigating a Thai menu can be a challenge. She was knowledgeable and guided me to what I could have, what they could change, and what I couldn't have so I didn't have to worry about munching off of someone else's plate.  Nice decor - tasteful, clean, well kept up.  Only suggestion would be for them to clean up the back door of the restaurant where the boxes / trash go as it is where their parking lot is and doesn't give a good first impression.  We had: Satay Sampler - moist chicken, nicely done beef, and they put the prawns on the side. Peanut sauce was good - not peanut-buttery like some.  Tom Ka Gai - so good, we took the leftover liquid home to use later. Super Natural Salad - fresh, flavorful, and a large portion that 2 could easily share (we spread it around to 4) Mi Dang - pork was amazing! Holy Basil Chicken - I couldn't have this, but the chef loved it! Chicken Curry - the benchmark of a good Thai place and this one passed with flying colors.   Probably won't be back in the area for a few years, but will definitely make a stop when we are.",

Tried the corn fritters -- interesting dish with a sweet hint to it.  The spicy fried egg from the secret menu was capturing to admire -- but tasted okay -- too sweet for me.  As per recommendations from others I ordered the veg pad Thai and veg temple of fire fried rice.  Rice was delicious and pad Thai held up to its rating. All pad Thai lovers will appreciate its taste. I'm not a pad Thai person.  All in all good food and good experience!",

I had the yellow chicken curry.   It was okay.   They add some kind of thickener to the sauce, which I don't like it when thai restaurants do that.    Just let the sauce stand on its own.   You don't need to thicken it.   Thankfully, the chicken was not boiled, which is what I had in another Asian restaurant I reviewed.   Ughhh!!  Gross!!   I think twice is enough to try it out, no matter how many years in between.",

I don't believe they made the chicken to order as it was very chewy and tough, like it was reheated in the microwave. The service was pretty good, not a long wait for seating or service.

Two waitresses ignored us, one cleaning a table that was obviously not needed.   After waiting for about five minutes, I asked one of the waitresses about being seated. She said she would get a hostess.   The hostess comes out and explained that we wouldn't be seated for about 30 minutes because of the large party that just arrived. Because the restaurant was about 70% empty and they wouldn't seat us, we left.   I realize that this restaurant was featured on the Food Network so I'm assuming the food is great; however, if a hostess doesn't seat guests in a nearly-empty restaurant, I also assume they don't want to serve us.",

We started with the satay sampler and the corn fritters, they were outstanding. We flirted with entree options for a while before we committed, I opted for the beef panang curry (my go to Thai dish) and my fiancee got The Fat One dish. I slugged down a big Tsingtao while we enjoyed our apps. We got our entrees and I was really wowed by the presentation of the panang curry. The taste was really good, it had some nice heat to it that was flavorful but didn't singe my taste buds. The Fat One was really good too, pretty much like a Drunken Noodle dish most other places offer. I ordered a Marooned cocktail, which was a little more foofy than I get - the cocktail was fabulous, basically a booze ice cream sundae with coffee.",

I'm from San Francisco where there is no shortage of really great Asian cuisine, authentic to fusion, so this place is really a treat. Made sure I came a few times and tried a different dish each visit to get a good idea of how to rate this establishment. Beautiful presentation/plating and very fresh high quality ingredients. That being said, I took off a star for the price factor. While the food is excellent, the appetizers are very small portions and a few of vegetarian dishes just aren't worth that much money--in both quantity and difficulty of preparation/execution. I can slap rice noodles on a pretty plate as well--albeit they wouldn't be as tasty, they still wouldn't be worth only a dollar less than a meal with chicken (and their meat dishes are portioned generously as far as more eclectic and trendy restaurants as this one go). Just my two cents on that... Long story short, will definitely be back and will still overpay for appetizers and veggie dishes. Won't feel too bad about it either because it's really just that good.",

    "text": "Craving Thai, I wasn't willing to drive all the way up to Siam Thai, on 51st Ave and Northern, to get my fix and I had yet to try the Thai my own neighborhood had to offer. Deciding on Wild Thaiger, I chose to save Thai Hut for another time.   They offer ample parking behind the restaurant and patio dining if you so choose. Seeing no one out on the patio (yea it was warm out but not that uncomfortable), I entered the restaurant and was greeting and seated quickly, choosing a spot at the bar.   Thai iced tea in hand I reviewed the menu. Hummm, ok pretty standard menu, but being a fan of curries I noted my choices were limited. I guess I could have had them sub the beef for chicken in the dishes but I wasn't feeling up for the hassle.  After a process that seemed like forever, I decided to start off with the Tofu Towers Appetizer and settled on the Green Curry with beef.   The tofu towers were well presented with a cucumber \"chutney\" / salad that was fresh with a vinegarette that still didn't do much for the tofu. [The same cucumber salad vinegarette at Siam Thai is more clean and crisp.] While green curry's are not generally my favorite (I often find them bland and less flavorful than a red), the beef green curry was tasty. The heat was one that built up slowly as you ate but was never overwhelming to the overall dish. The jasmine rice was cooked perfectly.   While overall I can't complain, I can say I have had better but it is a worthy option when seeking a quick Thai fix. Still craving a good curry I guess I know what I will be making at home this weekend. Or maybe I will try Thai Hut.",

We got to the restaurant at a decent time on a Monday night there was three other tables, we asked to down in one of the empty booths but she told us that we could not. That we had to wait. . We looked around and couldn't figure out why it was a 25 minute wait. We said okay we would like to sit down the bar and have a drink my uncle and aunt enjoy a nice glass of wine. The waitress who was very rude, told us that if we sat down at the bar to have a glass of wine that we cannot sit at a table. We looked to her completely confused she said that we could not dirty two areas of the restaurant. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! We said okay and could we sit at a table, that we will stay at for dinner,  we will understand if they couldn't get to us for the 25 minutes we can still sit and have a drink, she said no we have to stand there or sit on the bench waiting for a table for the 25 minutes or we cannot eat there!!!!  We left the restaurant and I will never return. I have now read the reviews how the service has sank. It's sad because it was a very enjoyable place at one time. Big fat F for this place.",

Received a royal welcome from a singularly beautiful Thai woman, sit where you want, move chairs to be more comfortable, we are so glad you are here etc etc.  Then nothing.  Maybe it was our fault as we chose outside on a cloudy cool day.  After no response, I went in ordered food.  Food was delivered 45 minutes later.  Didn't have a complete place setting and they never returned so I trudge back inside and so it went.  Then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived.  Why ask about spice levels?  Another trip to the bar for some peppers.  They gave me chopped serrano peppers so I can only conclude the kitchen was not attentive to our choices.  We chose WT based on Yelp reviews and have to say it looked like they would know Thai food and maybe on a different day the experience would be better.   However, on our visit, we were treated as intrusions instead of guests and are not likely to be back.  Not worth the time or money solid 2 stars.  Mike",

I read many reviews and even with many complaining about the service, we gave it a try.  First upon arriving I was met by a friendly hostess, who offered to get me a beer while I waited for my friend.  When I went to pay she said don't worry, it will be added on your bill. Now I like that in a place!  When seated our server (huge smile) immediatley was there offering all of us more drinks, so far I find nothing like those that have complained.  Since it was a Friday during lent my friend could not have meat so we ordered with our drinks the veg sampler app.  It came and was fantastic and most suprisingly light.  I ordered as a main the seafood panang and it was so good.  The panang sauce had great flavor with a  nice touch of heat on the backside.  None of it remained.  My friend ordrered the mango shrimp and ate every bite of that.  Finally anyone who does not have mango and sticky rice at a Thai joint is nuts in my opinion so of course we ordered that.  Just delicious!    So this place is legit, good service and good food.  I would if I could give it 4.5 stars.",

But, when I saw the prices and weighed my hunger - I thought better about it.  Next door, I found Wild Thaiger which was also highly rated and seemed like a better choice.  I was right!!  I sat down at the bar and was quickly helped by the friendly waitress.  I flipped through the menu and saw all the usual Thai fare - but one specialty stuck out to me...  a spicy wild boar dish.  I was in and the waitress double checked to be sure I was aware about the spiciness of the dish.  Armed with a beer and water, I dove in for a fantastic feast.  I didn't notice the sliced thai chilies that adorned the dish until I really dug in.  Phew!!  It was spicy and it was delicious!!!  The wild boar appeared and tasted like tender slices of pork.  The sauce was flavorful and the chilies gave it a great kick.  The Thai girls in the kitchen were pleasantly surprised to see me finish the plate without suffering too much.  In fact, I LOVED it.    I don't really spend much time in Phoenix, but I will revisit Wild Thaiger if I am near by.",

Some of the more unusual dishes, on the other hand, are very tasty. Holy Basil Chicken is delicious if you order it to eat at the restaurant. However, if you order it to go, it will be badly overcooked by the time you get it home. I wish they took that into account when preparing it. Most Asian takeout does not seem to have this problem.

It took 30 minutes just for the waitress to take our drink order and another 30 for her to take our food order. She took even longer to collect the bill and run our card. We could see her chatting behind the counter with another employee. My boyfriend had to walk up to the counter to ask her to run our card as we had been waiting for so long. Considering there was only one other table in the whole restaurant this was ridiculous. Extremely disappointed with my experience and I will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Usually when my friends go on and on about how they love a restaurant, I can't wait to get in and try the food. Our tastes are often a match.   The first concern I had from the beginning was the fact that there was only one person of Thai descent working and she was slinging the stuff they were selling.   We open the menu to find reasonably priced fare (a soft spot for my wallet). Many of the dishes you would be accustomed to finding in any Thai restaurant could also be found on the menu here. Since it was my first visit to this establishment, I decided to go safe and ordered the Pad See Iew with Chicken. Once it arrived, I was pleased with the presentation. But in my many years of eating I have learned, just because it look good fo show don't mean it goin' da taste good!! To be fair it wasn't horrible... but I certainly have had better.   The waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive. Something just seemed a little off about her? I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was that was off... but if I do, I'll let you know. Perhaps one thing could have been the fact that a table of 8 came into her section about 15 minutes after we arrived and we seemed to have been just forgotten.   To sum it up folks... if you are in the area and you want a REAL Thai dish with plenty of kick hit up Thai Hut on McDowell and 1st St. Amazing food served by the people that invented the stuff, and prompt extremely attentive service.",

It was not very busy and the best attention we received was from the sweet beverage server. I attempted to order from her and she needed to get our server, wish we could have kept the first one. Alex seemed put off by us and hardly wanted to engage our questions about the menu after putting in our starter. Took an additional fifteen minutes or more before we requested her return so we could place or entree order. Starter: Dragon eggs, 6 fried dumplings filed with pork and crab, $10, I was so hungry at this point and they were a nice start. They did taste like chicken meat balls though with a sweet hoison. I ordered beef panang and was surprise that there were absolutely no vegetables in my dish, I order curries often. The portion was large and I'll dress up the rest with veggies at home but I will now be returning to Wild Thaiger. The beverage server should move to a nicer place that will recognize her genuine nature and potential talents.",

While Thaiger is on the higher end of the down town Thai spectrum in both prices and presentation.  Most dishes are 7.95 with soup OR spring roll but not both. The vegetarian dishes are 8.95 and some of the noodle ones are closer to $10.  Service was fairly slow, less than ideal at lunch hour and surprising as they were not very busy. Another negative note is the open kitchen. I was able to see one cook use the microwave on something. Microwaves and gourmet never mix.  I had the Veggie Kiewan 8.95 with a spring roll. The spring roll was nothing special. The green curry was quite rich and thick one of the richest in town. The vegies were good as was the tofu this is all topped with a beet garnish. Overall it was a good dish.  My co workers opted for the soup. It was a curry soup with chicken in it. They said it was just ok.  Due to the slower service, microwaves and higher prices I gave it 3 vs 4 stars. If you want to impress a client for a lunch this is the thai place to go to.",

The wait when we got there was normal but there's no real waiting area. The hostess said we can wait at the bar but there was no bartender. That was a little weird.   There's an open kitchen which I enjoy. Watching them prepare all the dishes made me want to try everything that came out of it.   Waitress came to the table quickly to take drink orders. She didn't offer or suggest appetizers. And once we ordered our food it took a long time for it to come out. Normally I don't make a big deal out of it but the place is very small and they weren't busy.   God was delicious though. Very flavorful and smelled great. I got the Chicken Curry. My friend got the Temple of Fire and we shared Tropical rice with chicken and beef. Im not big on spice and the Temple of Fire is pretty dam spicy. It looked so good I had to try it and I was pissed I did.",

The freshie rolls and papaya salad were what I expected and tasted good.  We were actually disappointed with the dragon eggz. If there was shrimp and crab in there I would have never known. Just tasted like a pork meatball in a wrapper. It was really dense too like they mixed it and shaped it too much.  Service was excellent and the place was clean and looked nice.

I was disappointed about that.   My girlfriend ordered the Holy Basil Chicken. It was a bit spicy for my taste, but she enjoyed it. The chicken was seasoned nicely and was topped with some items I did not recognize.  Overall, great presentation and pricing with this restaurant. We will visit again.

    "text": "I was so happy to see that they have yellow curry-- and even more pleasantly surprised that it had a really authentic flavor, as someone who is used to Southeast Asian yellow curries rather than the more typical red or green! It was not too spicy but nowhere near bland. So so satisfying.  The Peanut Chicken is also excellent. Tender chicken drenched in peanut sauce, you can't really go wrong here.  As for noodle dishes, the Pad Thai is of course a go-to for most people. Whether you want to stick with the classic or go the road less traveled, you won't be disappointed here. The Pad Thai is heaping with veggies and meat, and is extremely flavorful.  Exercise caution when ordering something spicy, because the levels of spicy can significantly vary by day! Also, one star off for the spotty/slow service at both the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations, but other than tha, really worth the stop!",

Just like everybody else, I discovered this restaurant after watching diners drive-ins and dives on the food network so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.   We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Contrary to other reviews the waitstaff was quite friendly and had no problems taking our order quickly. We ordered a bunch of different things to try it all out.   I LOOOOVED the Tom Ka (best I've ever had and I am/was loyal to Thai Rama)!!! For appetizer we had the Dragon Eggs- we preferred them steamed but tried both. We also enjoyed the yellow curry, spicy and delicious, as well as the Pad Thai with shrimp. All were amazing. I had the Milk Boba to drink and that was coconutty, sweet, and yummy!   A little more pricy than we usually pay for Thai but the flavor profiles were bomb. We will be back. Soon we hope.",

It's right downtown a couple blocks from a light rail stop - great location (pro tip: don't park in the lot on the south side of the building - use the one behind it or you'll be ticketed!). It has a large patio too.   I ordered a boba Thai Tea and the veggie tofu pad thai. I thought both were good - not the best Thai food I've ever had but a solid contender. My husband was not crazy about his dish (although it certainly looked cool - I posted a photo). He kept picking out what looked like some sort of vegetable that was really hard and chewy, he described it like chewing on gristle. Not sure what it was but he wasn't a fan.  The service leaves something to be desired. It's a sit down restaurant but the customer experience is not the priority (which is fine for a quick meal after work for me). Our servers were effective and prompt nonetheless.   I wouldn't say no if a friend wanted to go again. I'd definitely order the tea a second time!",

It's usually my go-to Thai dish, and I loved their version - extremely flavorful instead of just tasting like a soy sauce gravy.  The interior is beautiful as well. Nice finishes, tiger art, an aquarium, even the restrooms are finished nicely.  However, prices are a little high and service was average. The place was half full and service was not attentative. Maybe they were understaffed? They also seemed stressed.",

I ordered the iced tea and was pleased to taste the notes of raspberry and jasmine in the green tea beverage.  It was light and refreshing, no extra sweetener needed.  I didn't have to wait long to receive my huge plate of the lunch special Chicken Pad Thai.  It had cool cabbage and bean sprouts with scallions next to the hot rice noodles and chicken with a savory sauce topped with beats and cilantro.  I ordered the medium heat level which had a slight kick, will go for full spicy next time but not the super spicy which is the one level above.  It was fab, I will be back!",

I must say, I am so damn glad I tried it.  It was fricking incredible.  The Dragon eggz were moist and flavorful.  Definitely not too salty.  The sauce was the perfect balance.  I had half steamed/half fried; equally as delicious just a play on textures.  I couldn't decide on one dish.  I knew Guy recommended Mu Yang so I was leaning towards that.  However my gut was telling me there was something else on the menu that would take my breath away.  Possibly a curry.  I was right.  I ordered Mu Yang and Beef Panang.  Why not.  In life you will only regret the things you didn't do.  Mu Yang was flavorful and juicy.  It had a wonderful char flavor from the grill.  Papaya salad cut nicely through the richness.  The coconut rice was sweet and delicious.  The star though...the dish and moment I will remember forever is the Beef Panang.  The curry was thick and flavorful.  It had a depth of flavor profiles that for once stumped me.  It was the perfect amount of heat.  It was spicy so if you don't like spicy try something more mild in heat.  I had it with vegetables instead of rice so I could really enjoy the food and attempt to finish it all!  It was better with veggies!   Last but not least.  I was asked if I wanted dessert.  Normally no but again with my gut instinct.  So I inquired to see if I could find a reason not to want it.  Nope.  All desserts made in house from scratch.  I chose Mango cheesecake.  Unbelievable.  Incredibly moist and flavorful.  Sweet but just made the cut for not overly sweet.  Crust crunchy and homemade whipped cream.  What is better in life?",

First off, if you come at lunch time, you have to deal with hoards of suits who come here for it's lush interior design to serve as the backdrop to their loud and uninteresting war stories. Next, you have to accept a very short and unimpressive lunch menu that has next to nothing that I usually get at a Thai restaurant. Finally, you have to sift through a very bland and unauthentic entree with excellent presentation.  I really should go back and try it again. But with the likes of Thai Hut now open, I don't know why I ever would unless I was forced through a work trip. Especially with how bland the food is for a Thai restaurant. I prefer Thai food that lights me up like a Christmas tree.",

Wild Thaiger is located a few blocks north of the Heard Museum.  As such, it's wonderfully convenient to go here for a bite then wander down to see some American Indian history and artwork.  This was exactly what brought me there last night.  I was seated immediately upon arrival.  The server cheerily came over and, when my first beer selection was out, suggested a few options that I might also enjoy.  I like getting suggestions on food and drink from people who obviously have some knowledge and care about the subject.  I was not disappointed.  The Thai beer I had was wonderful.  Unsurprisingly, much better than the standard American swill.  Being that this was my first time here, I had to order something from the house specials section.  I decided on the Jungle Love (insert 70s funk music here).  A dish of primarily \"exotic\" vegetables and thin sliced wild boar in a very spicy red broth.  It was superb.  The boar, which I'd never had before, was not the core of the dish but still quite flavorful.  It added a great contrast to the mass of vegetables in the pot.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure half of what I ate in there, but it was all good.  Good, and spicy.  Not the immediate burn you get from some hot food, but the seething heat that only makes you sweat and your lips burn when you're more than half done.  It was exquisite.",

It was a pleasant experience with good service. Last night we brought my 9 year old step daughter who is the pickiest eater I have ever seen. She ordered a noodle dish with sweet soy sauce (she tried to get it without soy sauce but the waitress convinced us it would have no flavor). When it came she made a face but then tried it and loved it! I also had some and was very impressed. It had a lot of fresh veggies and a generous amount of chicken. The veggie spring rolls were also a hit with her and my now 2.5 year old and 9 month old. It was kid friendly. The Tom Kah soup was delicious (my fiance's favorite!) and we split the ribs which fell of the bone and were so tender. The kids fried chicken meal was generous and both kids loved it. The vegetables were all fresh. And the waitress was sweet. We will come back!",

Office employees flock to Wild Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring a few close friends or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share their secret.  The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and unpretentious.    The food is where the adventure begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild Thaiger.  The soup is a concert of spicy hot lemony flavors that leave you wanting more.  Don't fret, you can always order more to go. Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list of favorite's starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, nestled in fresh vegetables and comes with a seasoned dipping sauce.   The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable and you will want to try a new dish on each visit.  Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  If you want \"more curry\", \"spicier\" or \"hotter\" you only need to ask.   Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious and contagious.  Drink hints: A nice compliment to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet Thai Iced Tea.   It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave the open kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  She is the heart of The Wild Thaiger.  As Marcial and I leave and thank her for another wonderful meal, her gracious smile, hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us coming back.  Note:  METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild Thaiger.  Drive slow, this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle.",

True, the decor is kind of low key and the building kind of plain-jane...but the staff is always very friendly, sweet and attentive, and the food just plain delish.   My personal favorite is the Tom Ka Gai hot pot with Shrimp.  Great flavors and plenty big enough for two to share.  The patio is nice and usually less crowded than the inside of the restaurant.",

I have never been dissapointed by anything I've eaten here. The staff and owner are always friendly and attentive and the prices are reasonable. I would probably eat here every night of the week if I had the chance.  All of the appetizers are delish but the dragon eggs are probably my favorite, tasty dumplings with a tangy sauce topped with jalapeno rounds, so good! Their crab crisps are the best you will ever have! My favorite dish of the moment is the Rama of the jungle. Delicious melt in your mouth beef skewers with flavorful rice fritters and spicy green papaya salad YUM! All of their curries are amazing and so is thier peanut sauce. There is honestly nothing here I wouldn't recommend, I even like their tofu dishes, and normally I won't eat tofu. Oh and don't forget dessert, awesome cheesecakes and coconut ice cream, even a delicious chocolate cake.    If you love fresh, mouth-watering thai food, check this place out, I'm sure you will enjoy!",

    "text": "I suppose you shouldn't judge a restaurant based on a lunch rush experience, but such is what I have to work with and I doubt I will be back. Less because the \"15 minute\" wait took an hour, more because the food is too bland to suit me.  Thai food is spicy. Notoriously so - or at least it should be. I was excited that they would prepare their Pad Thai (a dish that serves as a very good baseline to judge everything else served in these places) \"Thai hot,\" despite it not having the associated chili icon next to it on the menu indicating that this was an available option. I love Pad Thai. I love it hot! Bring it on!  Well, there were chilis on the plate that were not on my companion's, so it certainly looked like they tried - but there was just no heat here, man. You don't have to make me sweat my balls off but come on - don't call this Thai hot! It was actually delicious but \"tasty\" Thai food without any noticeable spice is not what I call Thai food. It's Asian-American food and I can get that for way cheaper than this. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, they cater to the white bread Central corridor. Those guys consider Macayo's to be authentic Mexican.  For my Thai jones, I'm sticking with Siam Thai.",

Wild Thaiger has a nice patio dining facing Central, but it was a little too hot and they didn't have a misting system. The inside was clean with a combo bar and open kitchen.   We started with the Freshie Rolls with warm Peanut Sauce and Lychee Martini. Nice, but not the best in town (Pure Sushi Bar has a to die for Lychee Lemon Drop).    The entrees are huge and could easily be shared. We had the Kimow - hot and spicy clear noodles, chicken, broccoli, snow peas, sweet onion, Thai chili, garlic and sweet Thai Basil - Delicious!  To be fair, Thai is not one of my favorites, but we love to support local restaurants and this came highly recommended. Glad we tried it.   And for those of you who like it HOT and SPICY - Wild Thaiger has you covered.",

We had appetizers as well as dinner, and everything was sooooooooo tasty!  The presentation was pleasing, the portions outrageously large, and the service exceptional.

I will say that in that 15 minutes the lunch rush came in, so we understood. However, there was not apology or acknowledgment of our extended wait. We saw several of the parties that came in after us served before we received our food. About 25 minutes after our order was taken we received our food. Just as we saw two parties who came in after us headed out the door.  We were finally asked how the food was by an employee (not our waitress) and after telling him about our experience. We were told the full kitchen staff was working, but the wait staff was short. He said he did not know why it took so long for us to be served.  Our main problem was the lack  of apology or acknowledgment.  I really wish I had a pen so I could tell them that the two dollar tip that was left was not an indicator of how cheap I was, but how bad the service was.   As for the food, i was good, but not amazing. It definitely was not good enough for me to forgive the faults and try this place again.",

I was approached a couple of times by waitresses during this time, but told them I was just waiting for someone.  When my sister arrived, we went to the hostess stand to request a table.  There was one couple ahead of us, then two or three other couples arrived and crowded the hostess stand as we waited for someone... ANYONE... to seat us.  There is a tall room divider that separates the hostess area from the service area/bar/kitchen, so nobody knew we were there.  This should probably be addressed to avoid a crowd in an already small waiting area.  Once we were seated, our waitress took great care of us, and was happy to suggest drinks and food items.  We ordered the Dragon Eggz (prepared both steamed and fried), the Satay Sampler, and the Lahb Gai.  We loved the first two items, but the third wasn't exactly our piece of cake, although it was prepared nicely.  Using cabbage in the capacity of a lettuce roll was a little awkward.  All in all, we were both very pleased with our meal.  Had we not already been full (and in a rush) we would have ordered the coconut ice cream, which other Yelpers seem to sing the praises of.  I will definitely come back here.",

I am giving this place 1 star based on the fact that my dinner companion and I couldn't eat more than 1 bite of the Mahi curry dish because it was so hot.  Don't get me wrong, I love spice, we have a multitude of hot sauces, chili paste and spicy oils in our home collection.  My companion loves, loves, loves things spicy, but when we both take a bite and can't actually taste any flavors of the dish, just burning lava, well it is simply to hot.  When we called our server over to let him know that the dish was way to hot to be palatable he asked if we wanted it boxed up.  Um no, please just take it away.  He didn't even ask if we wanted something different. Here is the kicker, when he brought our check the dish was still on it.  I called him over and asked for him to remove it for the obvious reason that we sent it back.  His response, \"Ohhh sorry!  It does say spicy on the menu.\"  I couldn't believe it.  I got charged $14.95 for a dish we couldn't even eat.  Totally lame.  A manager didn't even come over to try to smooth this issue out.  I left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off.  I won't be back.",

Neither were very spicy (we love Thai hot) but the flavor very nice. We agreed that in central phoenix we would suggest SaBai Modern in comparison.",

Certainly not worth the drive across town.  I ordered the Tom Ka Gai and their basil chicken.  The chicken in both were like shoe leather--so tough I had to pull out the chunks of chicken and cut saw them with my knife.  While the seasoning was pretty good in the soup it was very very thin and watery and there was a TON of strips of lemon grass in it that I had to try and pull out---like I had a total pile of lemon grass on a napkin when I was finished.  The  basil chicken was not much better.  Watery sauce and minimal flavoring.    I lived in Bangkok for two years.  Honestly, the best food there is from street vendors.  This place was far from good Thai food.",

    "text": "I truly like the food here but the service continues to be horrible. Tonight we had the booth right next to the front entrance so we were not hidden by any stretch of the imagination. After 18 mins the waitress came by and said she also had a table outside, which could be good because she would be walking past us often - not. After waiting that long to be asked if we would like something to drink we knew we should order for the entire meal right then so we did. The busser brought our drinks shortly,a diet coke and an ice tea that was luke warm. 21 minutes later as we were getting ready to leave because many employees wandered past but never asked how we were or offered to fill our empty glasses - our dragon eggs were brought to the table, by another waitress - not ours of course, haven't seen her at our table since we ordered. They were delicious, always are. 20 mins later I see (the kitchen is open) what looks like what we ordered put on the shelf to be picked up by the server. After about 5 mins I commented to my wife that I hope that is not our meals because they are getting cold. 9 mins after that another waitress picked up those plates and (indeed they were ours) brought them to us. She did offer us refills for our drinks & actually made sure my iced tea had ice.The food was good - but not hot - it would have been delicious if it was. Sadly as we sat there in our vantage point by the door we watched 3 groups-a total of 10 customer walk out because no one came to their table. We have been long time customers but this may have been the last time - we even made it a point to frequent this restaurant during the light rail construction because we new business would drop with the difficulty of getting into the place. We finally saw our waitress when the meal was over - she was sooo polite and friendly when she gave us the bill. We thought maybe she quit because we hadn't seen her since she took our order. Maybe this should just become a take-out place - like I say good food but the service stinks.",

After 15 minutes, we had to get up to ask for menus while seated at a couch waiting for a table. We also had to remind hostess that we were waiting for a table. We order relatively quickly, only to wait 1.5 hours for our food. After an hour and no recognition from the waitress, we went up to find someone to ask. The waitress acted like it had only been 10 minutes and that \"only the soup looks ready.\" So finally, we get the food around 9 pm!!THE PLACE ISNT EVEN THAT BUSY-and yes, the tofu pad Thai was good but so not worth the low blood sugar. We asked for a discount on our bill due to the long wait and didn't get much off. AVOID THIS PLACE UNTIL THEY GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER!",

The front desk clerk at the hotel we were staying at recommended this place highly.  She was from Seattle and said she understood good Thai food. We trusted her and showed up promptly at 11:30.  By noon there was a line out the door and around the corner.  The staff was friendly and efficient and the owner/manager was directing the action which gave the whole experience a sense of organizational calm.  Anticipation was high and we were not disappointed.  The food was awesome!  The spring rolls were light, fresh, crisp and the wrap was flaky delicate pastry like.  The curry chicken was spiced just right and delicious. The Thai egg flower soup was perfect and had a definite kick to it.  The coconut ice cream was delicious fresh and homemade.  Absolutely the best Thai food I have had since moving from Portland, Oregon to Tucson in 2007.  I will definitely be hitting this place up again next time I am in Phoenix.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Being a bit of a Thai fan, I had driven by Wild Thaiger a number of times only to find it next to impossible to get reliable access due to all the light rail construction (I suspect my frustration and quitter mentality was pretty commonplace during the construction).  Now that the rail is almost up and running and getting to Wild Thaiger isn't such a chore, I went with a group of 6 to try this place out.  When you walk in you immediately notice how dark it is as the lighting given off by candles and the kitchen in the back.  I've been to plenty of restaurants that do this to set the mood of the place so I don't mind candlelight.  However, this place was almost pitch black at times to where I couldn't see my dish so they could improve on the lighting a little bit.  The booths are small and set up very nice if you're just out on a date with your special someone.  The menu selection isn't vast but has all the usual suspects (curries, noodles, tofu dishes, etc.).  I had the chicken and potato dish with yellow curry with some cucumber and pepper veggies on the side.  While the presentation was very nice, the dish itself was just okay.  Almost everyone in the group I was with also had a currie dish and agreed the presentation was more impressive than the taste itself.  The one gal who got a noodle dish however said hers was terrific.  Most of us got dessert to finish things off.  I got a slice of the mango cheesecake (very tasty).  Another person got the lemon ginger cheesecake and was very happy.  Everyone else got slices of the chocolate cake (which were HUGE by the way).  They also have drink specials on Monday and Wednesdays.  We went on Wednesday for $4 wine glass night.  I was gung ho to try a sip of the red Thai wine, but strangely the waiter strongly recommended against it.  I has a Shiraz instead which was fine.  Most everyone else got a white wine.  Overall, the service was a little bit slow (especially getting us our check), but it was adequate.  The waiter was knowledgable about the nuances of each dish (which was good because two people in our group never had Thai food before).  Amazingly, when we originally sat down, the restaurant was just about dead.  But after 8:30pm the place was packed!  Not sure if this is normal, but seems like alot of the folks who live in and around the downtown area needed a late Thai fix.  Bottomline, good, but I've had better.  I commend Wild Thaiger and their people for surviving the onslaught of light rail construction that no doubt crippled their business.  Based on what we've seen, this place had a pretty solid local following so clearly they've done something right.  This place is okay if you're looking to go out with a group, but I'd probably enjoy this place more if it was just me and my girlfriend.",

The one thing that I would watch out for is time constraint.  My coworkers and I used to work right by the restaurant and were a little more flexible with our lunch hour.  However, sometimes I did have to wait a little longer than I felt I should for my food (although they may have just been very busy those few times).  All in all, a good grub spot!",

Both had a really good bite to them without losing all of the different flavors in the dish.  That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot you lose the flavor.  Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.    The restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.  We will definitely be back as this will be our new home for Thai in the valley.",

I'm used to peanut sauce with just a bit of heat and was mildly disappointed with this dish.  My friend ordered the Pad Thai and it was good, but again not much heat.  Now our server did not ask us about stars or heat at all.  If I were to go back I would order the Pad Thai with a side of peanut sauce and add more heat.  All in all, an affordable lunch, good service, and decent Thai food.  I would like to go back in the evening to check out the inside as I never set foot in it.  Maybe try another dish too.

    "text": "Oh Wild Thaiger, how I do love thee! Actually, to be more specific, how I do love pad thai.   I hadn't been to Wild Thaiger in a while because I hate navigating around Central Avenue these days, but it was my co-worker's birthday and she wanted Wild Thaiger. I'm so so glad we went there, and I was double happy this afternoon when I ate my leftovers for lunch. The best thing about the pad thai at Wild Thaiger (besides that it is so good) is that there is so much I always have lunch the next day ( which is just lovely).   A note for those south of McDowell trying to get to Wild Thaiger: Drive up 3rd Street and turn left on Roanoke. You'll dead end into a strip mall parking lot. Park there and walk a few steps south to Wild Thaiger. Viola!   I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because I ordered a Coke and it tasted funny ... like way too soda-watery. When I told the waitress, she sort of shrugged and said, \"A lot of people say that.\" Yeah .... I had to ask, \"So, can I get something different please?\"  But my pathetic Coca Cola aside, it was a great lunch, and she even brought my co-worker toasted coconut ice cream in a coconut dish with a candle. How sweet!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this restaurant.  It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen, as all are the Thai places in the area.  I ordered two of my staples (Tom ka Gai soup and Green Curry) and tried a new dish (for me), Holy Basil.  I got everything takeout.  I'll start with the Holy Basil.  It was very good.  A nice balance of Thai flavors, and I thought it was quite similar to an Ayam Basil dish I used to get at a Malaysian place in Mt. View, CA.  My only complaint was that the chicken was big, thick chunks, like a fajita-style.  I expect delicate, tender meats at a high end Thai place.  I opened my green curry and said: \"WHERE'S THE SAUCE\"?  I am VERY upset at the lack of sauce.  There was so little I can't comment on the flavor of the curry.  And, they had 2 different types of green beans in there:  chinese long beans, and American green beans.  The larger Amercian green beans weren't cooked.  That sucked.  The beef was tender enough but the peices were too big.  The one redeeming part of this dish was the fact that they had eggplant in it.  There is something about eggplant in green curry....  The Tom Ka Gai soup was  fantastic.  My only complaint would be the chicken, which again, was large fajita-style slices.   Doesn't make sense to me.  While I was waiting at the bar for my order, I remember looking into the kitchen and wondering how they could possibly prepare everything on the menu in that tiny space.  Now, I think I know:  I suspect they prep all of their meats ahead of time and use the same size/shape/cuts for each dish to save time.  This results in a fajita-style cut of chicken that leaves me less than thrilled.  Overall, the menu is brief and the food is good, but I don't think it's worth a long drive.  I don't expect to return when I could make the same drive to get to Swadee, which was just fabulous.  I gave this place a 3/5 because the Tom Ka Gai soup and Holy Basil were VERY good.  I am however disappointed in the green curry, the  cuts of meat, and by the way they completely ignored my request for Thai spicy; everything was rather mild in my opinion.",

Had the veggie platter. I do appreciate veggie icons on menus to help me scan.  The corn cakes were crispy and not greasy. Though I thought that was an indonesian dish, not thai. Not complaining just trying to figure things out. Ditto goodness on the veggie spring rolls and spicy dipping sauce. Tofu skewers themselves were good but I can and do make a better peanut sauce than that. Just use the spicy sauce for everything on the place.  So that's 3 stars for food and decent price and 1 star for server fantasies + large clean bathroom + convenient parking in the back.  Bonus hygiene: saw cats milling around the rear door of the NEXT restaurant over. So that place lures all the varmints assuring cleanliness at Wild Thaiger.",

My first visit was a few weeks ago and was for take out.  My friend and I looked over their menu, and although I'm not a huge connoisseur of Thai food, the menu was chock full of yumminess. I decided on the Chicken Curry lunch special. It wasn't too spicy, just the right amount of kick for me.  And, it was very flavorful and extremely filling.  I desperately wanted to finished it all, but my tummy was at full capacity from the rich curry sauce.  I can't wait to go back to Wild Thaiger and try more from their menu. Their prices are decent, and they've got a lot of great menu items to choose from. It seems like it would be a great place for dinner and, when the weather is nice, to sit outside on the front patio. I definitely can't wait to have more Rarrrr moments at Wild Thaiger!",

That being said eating here tonight has By far reached and exceeds beyond my expectation. I was joined with my friend who is Laos. Laos being neighbors of Thailand, the food is just about the same with of slight differences. After a 20min wait on First Friday, we waited another 15-20 mins per each dish. We ordered 3. The first dish was spring rolls. Let me tell you I have had my share of spring rolls with peanut sauce. I thought I would experience just any other experience I've had, which is average. I mean it's spring rolls. The first bite with the peanut sauce was the most delicious bite I have ever had. I could of just ordered spring rolls and I would of been more than satisfied. My friend mentioned that the sauce was authentic sauce it was not your typical restaurant sauce. My friend felt like a she tasted a piece of home.",

So the hostess sat us at a table saying how there may be awhile wait, after seeing 2 servers walk by us like we didn't exist, the hostess later seated another table which were 4 Caucasian customers, we were still patiently waited for around another 30min, when those 4 sat down an Asian waiter quickly came to take their order, I got the waiters attention and said excuse me, we came here first. And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends. So in the end we left the restaurant hungry and went to a much better restaurant which served us very well, called Rice Paper.",

    "text": "We visited (party of 3) on June 23rd.  Arrived at 5:50 p.m. and were immediately sat (inside - too hot to bed outside).    Pro's:  the presentation of the food was amazing!  Presentation was only outdone by the taste - all entree's were very delicious.  I had the Gai Katchu and honestly wanted to lick the plate clean to get the remainder of the sauce!  We split a hefty slice of the Mango Cheesecake - it was simply yummy!  The staff were very friendly and made wonderful recommendations.  Con's:  it was a little dark and as time went by, all the inside seating was full and the noise level was too high to have a normal conversation - we almost had to yell at each other in order to be heard.  As others have noted, there was simply not enough staff considering the number of guests.  We ordered our drinks at 6:00 p.m. - delivered at 6:20 p.m.  When delivered, we placed both our appetizer (house salad) and entree orders.  The salads arrived at 6:40 p.m. with out entrees arriving at 6:55 p.m.  The staff was very friendly - just need more staff!    Looking forward to returning - and even if there is a long wait - at least I know the food will be delicious and make it worth the wait.",

They let us sit outside with our pup and every time we eat here everyone at our table loves their dishes. What more can you ask for? I like taking a stroll into the dark inside and looking at the photos of the famous people that have been here in the past, Steven Seagal and Guy Fieri included. Thinking about this place makes me hungry....",

    "text": "Wow! The smell got me from the moment my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were \"right\" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly a gorgeous spectacle of food.  We could not believe the cheap price, too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush we were seated at the bar and served right away.  I had the Thai iced coffee, served elegantly in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. My dining partner had tea served in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), shared a plate of fresh spring rolls, which are the best I've had since I ate them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not only delicious, and were accompanied by an exquisite peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. Served two for $9.  The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, with a few  cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out of necessity. The bar over looks an open kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.  Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the head chef with some local celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive to us are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We want to know when these take place!  If you love Thai...GO THERE!",

    "text": "This is a tough review to make.  I've heard nothing but great things about this place,  and the moment we walked in we were instantly turned off by the hostess.  We were asked if we would like to sit outside (mind you its 50 outside) and when we said no she said that they do not have anything else available.  I looked around and saw 4 tables open a couple with a \"section closed\" sign on them.  She then asked if you want to sit inside there is a wait.  I asked how long she said 15 min,  I said no problem.  She said if we want we can wait at the bar.  We went to the bar to find 2 half full drinks and employee clothing and rubber gloves laying on the seats so we sat at a high top.   Literally 3 min later the hostess comes up and says do you guys just want to sit here and eat?  Again I said no we would like a table,  so she went and got menus right away took off one of the \"section closed\"signs in a booth and sat us.     I could keep writing about the extremely poor service that nearly made us walk out but I will save you all time.   At the end of it all the food was amazing and is the only thing that kept us there.    The corn fritters were great, tofu with peanut sauce was amazing,  the satay sampler was my favorite,  and the pad Thai was ok.    I would definitely eat the food again,  but maybe next time I'll do take out.  I do not think I will ever attend the restaurant again",

I was really excited to try this place with my husband on Saturday.  I really enjoyed the opportunity to eat outside on such a beautiful day.  I was grossed out a bit on how dirty it was (the grime on the plastic curtains around the porch), the dust on the fans, ect.  I do realize I was eating outside in the desert though so I tried to let it go.  The service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for ice tea refills.  We had to ask for additional sweetner packets.  We were told they didn't have rice to serve our meal with so we would get rice noodles.  This was told to us in a very straight forward mannner with no apologetic tone at all.  No rice at a thai restaurant?!?!  How do you run out of something so basic???  Anyway, the must have remedied the situation because we did indeed get rice with our meals.  My husband ordered the wild boar.  He thought it was just okay.  I had the eggplant and tofu.  I asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it.  It was SUPER YUMMY.  The bill was a bit expensive and I won't be running back.    It took us over an hour to get our lunch!!  We didn't stay once we were done eating and spent almost 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant!!  Truth be told I think Thai Elephant or Papaya Thai are still my favorite thai restaurant.",

Arrived a few minutes shy of the end of lunch, so I was able to dine in peace.  Ordered the tofu green curry and the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I found the portion of the entree to be very skimpy for the price, and I've had much tastier, and creamier, curry sauce elsewhere (Tottie's, Thai Elephant, even Yupha's!).  Need I say more?  Seriously, WT's green curry tastes about the same as Thai Hut's, but at a portion that's about half (or less) of what I could get at TH, or any of the other places I've visited, but I suppose the \"atmosphere\" is what I'm paying for here?  That said, I must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious!  Loved the toasted coconut on top (well, on top of the bananas, but under the syrup toppings, coconut ice cream, whipped topping, and maraschino cherry!).  On my next visit, when I'm craving for something sweet, I will ask to have the syrup toppings, whipped cream, and cherry omitted.  The dish is perfect w/out them.",

I was pumped to try the Decha Boar, not only because it was boar, but it was listed as being \"Thai Spicy\". Everything is presented nicely, but nice presentation doesn't make up for taste. When my entree came out, the meat was very dry, and it was about as spicy as canned Rosarita spicy refried beans, which means it wasn't.  My wife told me that her Seafood Panang was relatively bland.  The best things we had that night were the appetizers, which were seafood pancake and dragon eggs.  We may go back one day, but it will be way off in the future.    If you want good Thai food that will satisfy without all the overdone presentation, just go to Sala Thai.",

The cilantro and jalapeno slice on top really took it to another level worth the sweetness of the sauce. Then my husband and I shared the Kimow noodle plate. It was delicious, but I would ask them to add a little more heat next time. It was supposed to be slightly spicy, but didn't have much heat to it. Other Han that the plate was delicious and perfect to split with an appetizer! We will definitely be going back to try the coconut ice cream and hot pots.",

Got seated right away, then it went downhill from there.  Had to ask my waitress 3x where our food was. We sat there for a full hour watching all the tables around us get their food! I told the gal I was over the wait and that we are leaving. She told us to hold on... I thought she was going to call the manger over. That was not the case, she was so nice to bring our bill over for the 2 sodas that we were drinking while waiting for our food that never came. WORST service of the year award! We haven't gone back since!",

Also they were out of mango for their sticky rice and didn't have any alternatives like custard or anything to serve with the sticky rice.  Meh, never ordering takeout from here again.",

He literally takes out every bad noodle to ensure perfection for each plate. What does this translate to -- really slow service on your entrees but goodness when received.

My only issue is I was sweating profusely on the walk back to the office.   The last couple times I ordered the veggie pad thai. So scrumptious! They plate it beautifully. They use a good variety of fresh veggies... not just the standard broccoli and carrots. Lots of zucchini and cauliflower. Yum. The sauce has a lot of fresh garlic. It is so delectable. May be the best pad thai I have had in Phoenix.  Service is prompt and friendly. For lunch I am in and out under 40 minutes. They keep the fresh iced tea flowing...  I can't help but growl when co-workers ask me where I ate for lunch. \"Wild Thaiger... rowl!\"",

This was a Saturday night not overly busy there at 5 o'clock the service was nonexistent No refills on coffee, iced tea, water asked for them never got them and then to kick it all off they took a credit card and were  gone for 15 minutes. When we tried to talk to the manager about it he was lackadaisical and didn't seem to care about any of it he said well what do you want me to do did not offer to talk to his waitstaff did not offer anything it took him more then 10 minutes we asked if we were going to get to the talk to the manager and she said well he's busy and I said well if he's too busy to come and speak with us I mean I can go ahead and post a review on yelp and other places without talking to him. He finally did come up by his lackadaisical attitude in the customer service field was beyond my anything I have experienced in a long time and phone calls will be made tomorrow.",

I was never offered a drink and when I asked if I could get a cocktail while I wanted I was ignored by the first waitress. The second asked if I need a menu for a drink... I said no I know what I would like ... she walk off.  Then the hostess came over and asked if I wanted a drink... we r going on 10 minutes now... I said I would have love to have a drink but now I'm sure my food will be ready any minute.. hostess was apologetic.. however when I tried to ask for a manager apparently she did not know who that was. Spoke to the waitress with the blue hair one more time to ask a question regarding Togo orders in the future... and explained that I would have liked to have a drink while I had waited ... and apparently she was to busy to to be bothered and told me as much ...

My friend had Pad Cha Seafood, which also burned beautifully.  I'm guessing this is what Thai food is really like in Thailand (minus the large amounts of seafood), though, so I'll stop complaining.  I'm a spice whimp.  The place is a little expensive and the portions are a little small, but I think the $4 Sangria more than made up for that.  All in all, would totally return.",

    "text": "So, I had a bit of a surprise for lunch today. I just landed in Phoenix, I was looking for a little something to eat. I saw that Wild Thaiger was listed on DDD and on Yelp. So I decided to give it a try. The food was, in short, very delicious. The wait staff were extremely friendly. I quite enjoyed a nice leisurely little lunch. It does take a bit of time. That's because I believe they make every dish from scratch fresh. At least, that's what it looks like in the kitchen. It was so busy. But, all in all, pretty worth it. I can't wait to come back and try more. I do recommend the Dragon eggz. Try them both ways, steamed and crispy. The cheesecake was scrumptious with a tropical twist of mango.",

The potatoes in the curry were just slightly undercooked in the middle, but the other veggies and chicken were fantastic. Spring rolls were crispy because they poked holes in the styrofoam containers to keep them from getting too steamy, amazing! Will definitely order from here again.",

The food is okay, nothing spectacular but nothing to send back either. We ate on the patio and enjoyed the misters. Inside it was too crowded and noisy for us. This is the kind of place to which I would return if somebody wished us to go there, but I don't think I'd even suggest it as our destination.",

    "text": "A friend saw this restaurant on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and told me to try it out. We went tonight as it is 3 blocks for our condo. 530 dinner and the restaurant was empty. Cute patio but too hot and they weren't seating outdoors. Plenty of parking in the back. Interior is a little dark but nicely done with a small made up bar if you need to come alone.  Guy Fieri recommends the Dragon Eggz : (dumplings) and we got one order split half fried and half steamed. The sauce is phenomenal. Loved the skillet plating and extra jalapenos. I am a sucker for Papaya Salad if done properly: The flavor was on point and they didn't put ground peanuts on theirs which is a plus for me. Definitely forgot to ask for Thai hot as there was no heat at all. Maybe they underestimated me cause my hubby is white. Beef panang curry: very tender beef like other reviews state. Flavor of the curry was very different than the norm. Much lighter in texture too and didn't have vegetables.  Pad Thai with chicken: hubby said it was decent but nothing to write home about. I very much dislike coconut but how could I not try the famous coconut ice cream? We ordered the fried banana with coconut ice cream and they battered the banana in shaved coconut too. More for hubby! The ice cream flavor and texture was good. Server was excellent and I loved her accent.  The entire restaurant was full by the time we left and people were waiting outside. Will be back to try the hot pot. Good, but not anywhere near the top for Thai food.",

There was an up charge of 3 dollars to swap out regular soy sauce for tamari.   The restrooms were clean.  Would not return.",

We came at 8pm on a Fri night and it wasn't too busy for a mom n pop spot. The lighting was HORRIBLE. I understand u want to set the mood outside but if customers tell you more than once that they can't read the menus then something needs to change. They lite a candle but it gave little to no help. We had to use our phones. Another thing we noticed is that the food took SSSOOOO long to come out! Also, by the time the food came out (3 plates at first and then another 10 minutes later) the food was luke warm. It seemed like they had plates ready but waited for the others to come out which made the rest of the food barely warm.   Ok on the upside, the presentation of the food was great! We ordered beef pad Thai, tropical chicken fried rice, yellow chicken curry and peanut chicken plate. They were all very good, but the temperature of the food down played it. It all tastes great. We were so Hungry after our softball tourney that we didn't want to send it back since it took so long in the first place.   Overall it's pretty good Thai food. Service was good as well. We Had a hard time understanding our waitress but we made it thru. If you're a local come try it.",

The dragon eggs that every one and their mothers seem to rave about were actually very underwhelming. Also, the crab appetizer isn't very good either. You can tell that it's just crab from a can which I'm not down for. Their desserts and drinks are nothing to brag about either.   We tried their yellow curry one time too when my wife and I went to dinner with our friends and the yellow curry was pretty delish! Also, they have a very confusing seating system where they will have tables available but they won't sit you yet until the kitchen can catch up with the orders. This is kinda strange but at the same time at least that means that they are making all the food fresh. If your looking for some good Thai food in central Phoenix you gotta hit this place up.",

The food is divine here. It is always fresh, they cook it when you come in. It is never pre made. Even when they are busy ,the customer service is very good. I love every thing I have ever tried here. Fresh and Delicious, and it smells wonderful inside. With all the lovely spices and such. Parking is in the back, and if you cannot find it, it is right next door to Durant's. Another great place. But, that is another story.",

This time the cabbage tasted a bit too much \"dirt like\" and maybe it hadn't been rinsed properly.  I thought I could just push it to the side and eat the rest. 20-25 minutes later I became incredibly sick and had to leave work. 6 hours later, I still have stomach pain. Really annoyed I spent $47 for a lunch for two ppl just to end up with some food poisoning symptoms. I had been craving this place for awhile and it's the only time I've gotten sick afterwards. Very disappointed in this experience.",

I wish someone would have picked up the phone at Wild Thaiger instead of wasting my gas and time.   JUST A LITTLE ADVICE Wild Thaiger, ALL your phone-in customer orders deserve the same respect and assistance as your dine-in customers! If you can't handle the heat, then get out of the kitchen!

    "text": "I went to wild Thaiger for dinner with three friends and although the service was good in a clean environment, the food was disappointing. The flavors and preparation is just not authentic. I am reviewing the food with the background of having traveled to Thailand and having lived most of my life in larger culturally diverse cities (NY, Chicago, DC) with close authentic thai food. Here are some critiques:  Pad Kee Mao - My favorite noodle dish of all time is supposed to be prepared with thick rice noodles sauteed to a variety of textures, and infused with a dizzying array of spice. Instead, the dish here is made with thin vermacilli noodles and tasted like a lump of wet ricey dough. I even explicitly asked for it to be extra spicy, but there was barely any.  Pad thai - This basic Thai staple was presented as a soggy clump of noodles with a watery sauce pooling at the bottom of the plate. The worse part was that despite all of that sauce, it was tasteless except for the peanuts sprinkled on top. There was no hint of tamarind or fish sauce or chili. Disgrace.  Tom Yum (chicken) - Again, what we received was a flavorless broth. There was no taste of lemongrass, no curry, and the chicken was dry.  Needless to say, this was very disappointing. For a large restaurant in a prominent location, the food served up here was worse than some of the shacks I've eaten out of in other cities.  Two stars for service and cleanliness alone, none for food.",

We ordered the Seafood Panang, which was good for two people to share.  Other members in our party ordered the Mu Yang (the sauce is amazing), Galee Gai and the Holy Basil Chicken.  After everything the wait staff brought us the More Mango Cheesecake which was complete sin in every bite.

Upon walking through the door, you are greeted by a life-size poster of Guy Fierri (?) and apparently this place made it to Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, one of my favorite shows and I missed this episode! Who has time for TV anyway? I enjoyed the swanky upscale interior design but this also led me to conclude that it would be a pricy experience. I was right. As it is hard to put a price on a great experience, the food was SOOOO good that I would have gladly paid double! I brought my folks with me a couple weeks after my first visit - they loved it too. Among the dishes we enjoyed: Spring rolls (pictured), the specialty Holy Basil Chicken (Thai green chili, Garlic, and Aromatic Basil $11.95), the Tom Ka Gai soup (Traditional spices, chicken, mushrooms, coconut soup) $9.95 ... and, of course, the Thai Iced Tea. On my next visit I want to try the Volcano Wraps (Insane chicken wraps with lemongrass, ginger, and thai chilies. Hot! $7.95), and also the Tom Yum Goong soup (Hot and spicy shrimp with mushrooms and tomatoes - $13.95) and finally, the Mi Dang Dang (Red BBQ pork, Soba noodles, sweet sauce, sprouts, Hard boiled egg - $10.95) but hey, that's on my next visit. Mouth is watering now. The food tastes BETTER than the photos look on their website, which is a mind-blowing paradox. Believe the hype this time, you'll see - just go. This is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.",

I had the Island Fried Rice and it was a perfect portion of rice with fruit, veggies and rice.  In addition the presentation for this was beautiful.  The drinks were good and we had the wonderful cocnut ice cream which on that hot summer day tasted and felt so very good.  The food is wonderful here and the decor is very nice as well.  The cook mingled in the small restaurant which was nice.   There was a long by the time we left.  Had the service been better they might have got 5 stars.",

However, I had a bad experience, where I witnessed a cockroach walking across the bar in front of me. I voiced my concern to Ola, she couldn't find it. But apologized. I was dissatisfied with this response and wrote her an email expressing my concerns. This is her appropriate, professional abbreviated response.  \"As a regular you know we have an \"A\" rating because we don't have a pest problem.  I will be glad to share the pest inspection reports and monthly service schedule for the last eight years which we have been in business.  It would be a perfect world if I could afford to have enough staff to open all of our boxes in the parking lot and stock all of our products individually to ensure that unwanted pests do not enter our doors. Of course we have discontinued purchasing product from the supplier and they are aware of the problem.\"  She refunded my money, and we're satisfied, moved on.   I show up today with my party---and she pulls me out of the restaurant, tells me that \"i'm not supporting her business\" and that a few days after my email she gets an inspection from the Maricopa County Health Department, and they gave her a \"B\" rating. She proceeds to accuse me of calling them, and blaming me for her low grade. I inform her that I dealt with her straight, communicated directly with her, and I considered it resolved. At this point she tells me she won't serve me anymore after being a customer for about seven years.  Having never dealt with the Maricopa Environmental Services, I'm not really aware with how they schedule their inspections but clearly it was a coincidence that it occurred 6 days later. I guess Ola never thought perhaps it was a different customer, or in fact that maybe it was scheduled every 3 months?  At any rate her reaction to customer feedback is not only unprofessional but just makes bad business sense.   Poor decision Ola, I'm really surprised your sanitation problem, and failing an inspection is blamed on your customers.",

Most places always give you a tamer version of a Thai dish but this one was quite the lip buzzer.  I was sweating through every delicious bite. Thankfully I ordered a combination of Soy Milk and Coconut water with Tapioca balls to complement my meal and Oh Wow, it was much better than you would think.  The inside area was far to dim and cramped for my taste. The thing that bothered me too much was the hard clashing of utensils, chatter, and the kitchen that made it an acoustic nightmare. I recommend sound baffling. It was really painful for me, and I don't even have sensitive hearing. I sat outside and on a cool April evening it was perfect. Besides my cosmetic opinions the food here was stellar. Among the best Thai food experiences I have had and will be coming back. Preferably when the outside area is available.",

Intricate curry ingredients but not sure if the green curry paste was home made, I think it's the canned variety.

During the hour we waited we were not offered water or even acknowledged by the waitress to let us know how much longer until our food was ready. We ordered the pad Thai it was pretty decent.

Showed up at 8:30 on a Tuesday night, the hours said they closed at 9:00 so I was a little worried they wouldn't be very happy with us but we were greeted with a smile and taken to a table.  It took a little bit longer than normal for our waitress to come take our order but she was especially friendly so it wasn't too bad.  We ordered the Turtle Island Crab appetizer, I got the Beef Mangone (I didn't want something too crazy on my first adventure with Thai food!) and my friend ordered the Pad Cha Seafood.  The Turtle Island Crab was amazing!  My only issue with it is that I wanted more!  The wonton crackers were perfectly crispy, the crab and avocado blended together great and the dipping sauce that it came with was sweet with just a little kick.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it again!  My Beef Mangone was equally as impressive when it came out.  The presentation itself was beautiful and once I dug in, the flavor didn't disappoint either.  The beef was tender, the sauce had a bit of a kick but nothing crazy and the veggies were cooked perfectly and complemented the meat nicely.  I was nervous to try my friend's Pad Cha Seafood because it had been rated 3 peppers which equates to \"Thai Hot\" but I was glad I got the courage to do so because it was delicious too!  Everything was again cooked perfectly and the sauce was pretty hot but not unbearable.  I can't wait to go again and find something else to try!",

When we arrived, we waited at the hostess station for probable 3 minutes before we were greeted.  Very odd.  Then when we were seated, another 4 minutes later before someone came over to take our drink order. A person who wasn't even our server.  Now when our server did come over, he was very attentive for the rest of the evening and the service was excellent.   We started with the Freshie Rolls. YUM.  These fresh \"Vietnamese type\" rolls were so yummy and for sure stand up to their name \"fresh\".   They came with a wonderful spicy peanut sauce.  I had the Pad Thai.  Thin rice noodles prepared with chicken, shrimp, and tofu topped with fresh sprouts, and crushed peanuts.  As always it was delicious and plentiful.

It was spicy but extremely flavorful the consistency of the rice was gloriously sticky.We also tried the hot teas I ordered the Gunpowder Temple of Heaven and she got the Lemon Souffle` and both were beautifully prepared and flavored. The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced to perfection and the service was great and our waitress was so friendly and helpful I wanted to come back the very next day. They also work with you on how spicy you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice and thought they did a great job of making the dishes spicy but not to the point where the spice overpowers the dish.",

    "text": "We went back here this past Saturday night with a friend from out of town and liked it just as much as we did when we tried it a few months ago. My Cosmopolitan was just as big and tasty as it was last time, and the service was still attentive and friendly. My friend is a pescetarian/flexitarian (doesn't eat meat except for fish), and we were really pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely delicious. Specifically, the Pad See Ew (which we usually get with chicken or beef) was still savory with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing, the Mussaman curry (which usually comes with a deliciously braised beef) was still really flavorful and was complimented nicely by the tofu. Even after trying a decent number of other Thai places in Phoenix, we like Wild Thaiger for the full bar, consistently good flavors, great service, and fun atmosphere, and we will definitely continue to come here often.",

It is made wth all vegetables, shrimp, chicken and tofu (tofu only for vegetarians).   By the way, the regular Pad Thai is also wonderful.   I have always had great service and  I have loved every dish I tried.",

    "text": "i've had a few dishes here...the veggie curries hit the spot for me...but the one dish that sticks out in my memory is the seafood panang. even though i am put off by the textures of  some sea creatures (especially squid and mussels), i love this dish. the sauce is savory, spicy, sweet, and rich. the assortment of seafood in this panang consists of salmon, scallops, mussels, and squid.  the salmon pairs quite well with panang sauce, as do the tender scallops. the mussels taste wonderful in this dish despite their graphic texture...the squid is rubbery and i can't recall a time when i've not eaten rubbery squid. is there a way to make its texture more palatable?...despite the squid, i probably order wild thaiger's seafood panang once a month when i can afford to do so and when i am craving a protein rich meal.   the veggie spring rolls here are okay, but not amazing. the thai iced tea is standard, which is good. the tom yum (or was it tom kah?) soup was unique as it had a sharper flavor than i'm used to--more spices seemed to be used, and it tasted fresher than some of the thai soup i've had in other thai places.   overall, i have to say i love this restaurant when i'm in the mood for thai.",

Went for lunch and got 2 great meals off the lunch menu and our total bill was $20...can't beat that.  The iced tea was a little different but in a good way - I think it was a green tea iced tea.  Very impressed, will definitely be going back.",
