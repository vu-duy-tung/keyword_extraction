    "text": "I will admit that I didn't read the fine print on the Groupon and tried to use it on a Saturday afternoon, but the experience was bad from start to finish.  You know that parking will be difficult in that area, so once you've managed to arrive, you're expecting to treated well.    It was pouring rain outside so we inquired about perhaps a hot buttered rum to warm up.  The bartender informed us they didn't have anything like that.  We asked about brandy, and he said they had brandy and asked what kind we wanted.  We asked what they had.  He said he didn't know and went to look.  He returned to tell us that they didn't have any.  Mind you, this is the BARTENDER, and he never even suggested a coffee with khaluha or ANYTHING.  We setteled on jack and coke and looked at the meager menu.    They say they are a bar and grill, but your choices consist of two sausages, a couple burgers, a single turkey sandwich, and i think two salads.  It was a joke.  When we were denied the use of the Groupon, we paid our bill and left.    As we were leaving there were people at the door that appeared to be the owners.  We walked out shaking our heads at the experience.  Y'all can keep your $10 I wasted on the Groupon.  We already wasted $2 for parking to get to an establishment that is more a bar that serves something to eat than a bar and grill, where the bartenders have no idea what is in stock, nor do they know how to suggest a proper alternative.  REALLY people?  You will be closed in no time.....",

(Beers used to all be half price during happy hour, but that has changed, so be sure to confirm with your waitress/waiter that a particular beer is included in happy hour pricing.) And, as another reviewer stated, The Handlebar serves less than 16 ounce pours of beer. :(  They have great burgers and brats (and other sausages). The fries are great. And, they've recently added great fish and chips that I like better than those from the couple of Irish pubs in the neighborhood.",

If you are looking for something like Red Robin or some other kitschy trash heap where you can get your fruity margarita with a bendy straw and a free glass too (!)... this is not the place for you.  Handlebar is a beautiful, new bar on Mill with an amazing selection of craft beers, bottled and draft, and a limited (but tasty) selection of the food.... the phrase \"bar and grill\" is too broad. This is a modern American Pub that also serves locally-crafted (and mighty tasty) pretzels and bratwursts. The waitstaff are all very friendly and accommodating, as are the security team (which is something you don't expect). If you're not used to the Mill club scene, the music will be blaring on weekend nights (you cant even hear you own thoughts!), but that is why it is better as a day-drinking or weekday night haunt. Great beers, great food, a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere (except on Fri & Sat nights). Give Handlebar a try next Tuesday, their Happy Hour is 3.30-6, and the beer is GREAT!  ps- Tyler and Pierce and Kylee are awesome servers. Ask for them.",

They only had half a dozen items on their lunch menu, so I got a regular cheeseburger and fries, medium.   The fries were ok, nothing special, but the burger was so gross I couldn't even finish a 1/4 of it. The meat was like frozen cafeteria patties, and was mostly this weird white stuff (fat??) It was cooked well done and had zero flavor.   For a place that offers such few items, you'd think they'd make them amazingly. Not this place. I'll take a pass next time I'm in Tempe.",

    "text": "The Handlebar and Grill is my most favorite place to go on Mill Ave in Tempe.  I have been here on a busy Friday and Saturday night and I have been here on a laid back, slow Wednesday night. Every time I go I am never disappointed There's great music (usually acoustic, never house music, and often no lyrics but still upbeat), great atmosphere (lofted ceilings and wooden benches make the place so much more open and the lighting by mason jar candles is awesome), and good looking guys (seriously every time I go there's plenty of eye candy.  What I love most about Handlebar is how laid back and refined it is compared to places like Que or Canteen. Handlebar knows it's not a club and it's ok with that. THe open air patio and bar area make it intimate enough that you could still go here on a Friday night after a date for drinks or a Friday night with friends to rage.  The drinks are a tad pricey, but they're great. I have only had one item on the menu that was the pretzels. For $6 you get 3 huge stick pretzels with beer cheese and spicey honey mustard dipping sauce. More than enough for one person, these treats are amazing. Really doughy, soft pretzels and the beer cheese tastes like it was just poured out of the can. Ugh, so good.  I don't have to say whether I'm coming back here or not because I am.",

    "text": "I don't normally write long reviews, or reviews at all for that matter, but felt that this one was needed.    I went to The Handlebar this past Friday and when I received my bill there were a couple of drinks that were not supposed to be on there.  When I told the bartender that gave me my bill that there errors, she replied, \"There is nothing I can do about....\"  When I asked for a manager she tried to play it off and say that it was very busy and it would take awhile for him to get to me.  I said that was fine and that I would wait.  She then looked very annoyed and proceeded to talk to her \"manager.\"  He then came over with a piece of paper with his name (John Gallagher) and his number on it.  He told me that it was very busy and asked me if I could call the next day and he would handle it.  It was indeed very busy so I accepted that.  When I tried to call the next day, the number that he had given me was \"Out of service.\" At that point I was annoyed, but gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he had made a mistake.  So I then called the bar and left a message and waited for a call back.......that I never received.    Today (Sunday) I went into the bar in person to talk to a manager.  When I explained my situation I was told, \"There is no John Gallagher that works here.  He worked for The Canteen 2-3 months ago.\"  The employee LIED to me and gave me a False name and number!  The manager then proceeded to ignore what I was saying and act like I was making all of this up!  With the manager refusing to listen to my story (even though I presented him with the paper with the name and number that his employee gave to me) I just left and called my bank.  I filed a claim with them and they gave me money back, thankfully.    I will NEVER spend a dime nor step foot in this place again.  I can deal with bad service somewhere, but when an employee gives False information to a customer regarding a billing mistake that was the bars fault, that is not okay.",

Luckily Yelp has an \"edit review\" option, so when I come again, I will have the option of changing the star rating if I deem it appropriate. We came here for dinner and drinks a week into opening. The place itself is in a neat building on Mill Avenue. We took a seat on the rear patio which offers great views of the surrounding Tempe architecture and nightlife.  First and foremost, our service was excellent. I don't remember the gentleman's name, but our server was a very well-spoken redhead and was not going to leave work that day without making sure we left satisfied. There was a reason he had to do that though...  We ordered brats (hey why not?) and they were still frozen. FROZEN. The place just opened, we're sure that it's just new cooks getting used to new equipment and all that fun stuff, but after we sent it back (we insisted they just throw our brats back on the grill), they were still frozen. By this time, we were pretty upset, made worse by the fact the \"regular sized\" french fries were smaller than the Value Size fries at McDonalds (granted Handlebars' fries tasted better by a slim margin). Our redhead server apologized profusely. He offered to comp the whole meal and give us brand new food from scratch (the latter of which we took him up on) which was a great gesture. The new food was hot as could be (finally) and after we resisted the free meal, he still insisted he buy our next drink round. He even dragged a heat lamp over closer to us. Cool, thanks for making this situation right.  All in all, I look forward to coming back again after they iron out all the lovely bumps in the road that come with opening a new business on Mill (where many new business go to fail miserably).",

They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server.  If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.   With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy.  I will definitely try them out again.",

It's a wide open space, with lots of TVs, open windows, and a funky lookin' little joint. The bathroom sinks are fun, but now that I'm sober and thinking about it, I actually don't like picking up a bottle of soap that some dude just picked up after touching his junk...however, I do think using a ketchup bottle as a soap dispenser is cute, it's just not sanitary.   Anywho, this place is just okay when it comes to food. We ordered a couple of items off the menu and no one was overwhelmed by their entree (a burger, sausages, and a portabella burger). What I didn't like was that you had to order fries a la carte. I'm not really down with that.   The drinks were okay. The waitress looked at me like I was from a different planet when I asked for a John Daly. They have a summer shandy that was pretty good.   Handlebar is okay. I like the space and the concept more then I like that actual bar.",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed in the event tonight. I went with my friend who was celebrating her birthday and was attempting to show her something new on Mill. It definitely did not work out that way.  We got in and were told that there was seating available. We walked around a few times and finally found some group that was leaving and grabbed their table. We waited.  Finally our waitress, Brittany, came over and apologized for the mess on the table, got our drink order and left. We waited. She finally showed up about 10 minutes later with our beers and bolted off. Where we were sitting, there were two picnic tables, side by side, we (the two of us), sat on the table closest to the roll top doors; there was a four top on the other table. Another group of five decided that they were going to sit in between our groups. We said fine, as we understood that there was limited seating and that they were in the same situation as we were a few minutes ago.  We waited again. She came and took their drink order and we were able to stop and ask about the food service this evening. We were told initially that there were people passing around samples. What we were told by Brittany was this:\"there are people bringing food around as samples; if you get some, your lucky\". We never got any food.  In fact, the other four people on the opposite end, were served twice. Two trays, both times. We finally resigned to the fact that we were not going to get any type of food and were ready to leave.  We looked for our waitress and were unable to find her. We finally located her and tried to get her attention and she was serving the table behind us who kept running her, one beer at a time it seemed, to the well. As we finally got eye contact with her and closed our tab, we made it to the front and exited.  There were plenty of what seemed to be managers, hob knobbing with other guests. They were not paying attention to anything that was going on. I understand that this was a preview night, but that is one of the goals as managers; to identify where there are issues and resolve them.  I was truly disappointed with the service, the staff, and since I have never tried the food, I would not know what to comment on that part of your offerings.",

    "text": "Handlebar is a nice combination of good food and a great alcohol selection, all at a decent price. Their atmosphere is what truly sets them apart, they take a much more laid back chill kind of scene rather than the typical noise of mill, and because of this has become a staple visit each time we hit the bars.   Their food is very reasonable, and their kitchen is open late (midnight, I believe) so it's a great stop for food and drinks later in the evening. Even at later hours they are still full service, so you can get a table and be waited on which is pretty awesome.  Even though you can get waited on, don't expect amazing service on these busy nights. Of course it's hard to manage on mill on a Friday night, so I consider it no major fault of their own, just be prepared to have a few extended waits between ordering and getting your food/drink. Also, on these busier nights (Friday, Saturday) they tend to focus more on a \"clubby\" kind of scene and pump up the music and rearrange the tables. It feels like they don't quite know what they're going for when the bar is in this mode, but all in all it's still a classic stop if you're looking to go to somewhere a little more laid back.",

We were told to seat ourselves on the patio and she said the server would be out in a few minutes. 20 minutes later I still haven't seen anyone even walk by or acknowledge the fact that I was there. The inside was not even remotely busy, so I am pretty upset at this point. Another 10 minutes later and I just left. I am disappointed because the food looked really good, but the service is terrible. I Would not recommend going here unless you have all day to wait.",

    "text": "This may be my first negative review. I generally come here to praise establishments and encourage others to visit. I've been to Handlebar once before and enjoyed it, but today was not good. I'm not writing this to discourage anyone, but more so in hopes that management sees it and addresses it.  My girlfriend and I arrived at about 2:50pm today and asked if they had any specials or happy hour going on. The server said no so we ordered two beers(They have an above average selection, by the way). We began looking through the food menu and noticed happy hour began at 3. Now, while she was technically correct that there was no happy hour at 2:55, I've never been to an establishment that didn't make me aware of an immediately approaching happy hour.  Moving on. We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer. Brutal. They looked and tasted like the dish had been prepared 20 minutes prior. The pretzels were lukewarm and the cheese had already congealed. That was disappointing. Afterwards, the server acknowledged the happy hour once we asked.  We shared a burger and fries. The burger was good, but \"good\" like a Carl's Jr burger is good. Fries were excellent - on point, really.   Overall, I didn't feel welcome by the server and she didn't seem like she was happy to take care of us. Also, another server legit changed her shirt out in the open in front of everyone. Whatever. Manager on duty was getting them ready for an event tonight so maybe all were distracted, but it was a very distasteful experience. I'm generally never someone that specifically calls out a server, but she had pink hair and I think someone called her \"Mercedes.\"  If you're walking by, walk 20 more feet and hit up Zipps. They never disappoint. Moving forward, when I bike to Tempe, I'll go the extra distance to hit up Four Peaks.",

They've got the best staff in Arizona, and work hard to have a constantly refreshed menu of draft and bottled craft beers. If you've got a specific taste, it's likely that they'll find something you like from a local to a rare brew.   There's a full bar and a menu of good bar snacks. Have to shout out to the fries with plenty of sauce options, the beer cheese, and the mini pretzel chicken pesto sandwiches that are amazing!

There was no tap list, which is not a problem, except the waitress and bartender didn't really know what beers they had.  The waitress did write some of them down for us and was really nice about it.  The bartender talked to me like I was about to try my first beer...I'm no expert, but I know the difference between a sour and a porter, thank you.  Ended up ordering a favorite beer of mine and turned out it was nitro (I'm not a fan of nitros).  Seems like something you might mention before pouring.  Overall, the staff was nice, though clearly lacking some basic beer knowledge.  I had planned to stay for a few drinks and left after one.  A little beer education can really go a long way.",

    "text": "I live on Mill and I've watched the changes over the course of 10 years. It's refreshing that Tempe has continued to develop a more diverse crowd these days. I couldn't be more excited about The Handlebar opening up and had high expectations, considering it's sister restaurants on Mill (La Bocca and Canteen) always deliver!  Everything from the music selection down to the 3 different types of wood used to warm up the interior space, I forgot that I was not in a hip German pub but in fact, downtown Tempe. Almost every exterior wall is a garage door that opens up to bar seating from the outside - love it.  Although World of Beer is a block away, the beer selection and atmosphere at The Handlebar reign supreme. I'm looking forward to trying more of the brats and pretzels with a wide selection of beers (hello.... Celebrator Doppelbock)! There are even beer cocktails on the menu!  What I'm most excited about, is that the level of music will not change all night, yet they'll still be open until 2am! If you frequent Mill Ave, you'll know that around 10pm the vibe at most places change. The DJs step in and blare club music. I don't mind it some of the time, but I'll most likely find myself on the patio of this pet friendly, bike friendly bar and grill.  Congrats Mill Ave, you got yourself a winner!",

The decor is just awesome, the fact that they built the place with an environmentally friendly approach (waterless urinals, power saving lighting, tankless waterheathers)  is to admire since they didn't sacrifice in looks and comfort (proof that doing the right thing can be also sexy).  I tried one of their beers, Firestone DBA and it was just delish. The temperature of the beer was great and the selection was wonderful (it was tough to choose what to have).  I'm sure this new gem of Tempe is a great addition for the neighborhood.   I can't wait to try the food!  Update: Since I said I couldn't wait to try the food, I went back and tried the sausages and the fries. I just have two words to describe it: simple & delicious. The dipping sauces were pretty tasty and original.",

    "text": "As a new Phoenician and a parent whose income now goes to supporting ASU and the area (hello Mill St bars and restaurants), my weekends are filled with exploring and determining repeat spots. Handlebar had been on my list as, coming from Los Angeles, it seemed to have that personality...at least from the street. Inside experience, not so much. Ah Handlebar, you deeply disappointed me and admittedly, I'll not be returning. With other options all over Mill, this place is sadly lacking in customer service and professionalism. Example 1: Bartenders need to learn to pour (a stout shouldn't be served half full of head and I can't even begin to tell you how much beer was wasted from half assed pouring. If I were an owner or manager, I would be ticked. I cringe at the amount of good been that's been sacrificed to the drain because of lack of experience) Example 2: when a customer says \"excuse me could I have a glass of water?\" the response shouldn't  be \"well, do you have a server??\". The correct answer in order to provide a positive customer experience would be \"sure, let me grab that for you\" (dumbfounded) Example 3: when a table of 4 orders food and the establishment isn't packed to capacity, said table shouldn't have to wait over an hour and a half for their food only to have it come and need to send it back when the cheese in congealed, sauces are hardened, chicken is fridge temperature cold, bread (untoasted) is hard. A server should be aware of the fact their customers are still sitting there with an empty table. Admittedly, she made sure we had our beers full, but when you're hungry, you expect to have a fork full of tasty vittles. Alas...not tasty and no vittles.  Overall unbelievably unpleasant  experience, and this is from someone who hates to complain about service.",

However the last time we went (a group of 8), our server seemed to not care whatsoever. Two of us came late and everyone had received their drinks before, but the server took forever to come back and ask if we wanted anything. We decided to try the food, some variations of grilled cheese sandwiches and bacon fries, and after what seemed to be 20 minutes, some of us received our food- cold, with hard cheese. A few people in our group hadn't gotten their food until the others had almost finished (they insisted we start without them). When they finally got their food, it was also cold, but decided not to send it back just so we could leave. After all that, I will probably only go there for drinks from now on.",

I don't often like to write negative reviews on here, but I did not have a great experience here.  We had made arrangements here for an after work function and had made reservations (or so we thought) for space to accommodate 20 people.  Upon arriving, no such space existed for our group.  There is a fire pit in the back of this place, which was apparently reserved for another party.  OK no big deal because there must be some other area for us right?  One of the staff, I think he was a manager, told us that he had our reservation but we didn't specifically request the fire pit only \"space for 20 people.\"  That was the last I heard from the manager and there was no effort to help us find a space for our group.  On top of that, I had to go to the bar to get my drink and we never had a server come to our table.  Not a great experience.",

My husband & I  ventured over to The Handlebar & Grill on a Thursday night around 8:30 and the place was busy but not near full.  We opted to sit on the patio and had to wait more than ten minutes for a server to come over to our table.  While we were waiting the tables on either side of us were being helped, and we continually tried to wave over the server who persistently ignored us. There were multiple servers working, but they appeared to be gathered in a group in the corner talking to one another and hanging with their friends.  After someone finally came and brought us menus another ten minutes passed before we received our beers.  After sipping our beers we decided to order some food, but our server never returned,  After finishing our beers and our entire craft of water we spent another twenty minutes attempting to flag down servers (because ours disappeared) and ended up just getting our check.  We had high hopes for this place, but it was a huge disappointment.  Maybe with more mature employees this place will be successful, but in it's current state there are much better quality places to go on mill ave.",

After my wife and I had already ordered two (alcoholic) drinks and my son had asked for water, the waitress suddenly said she needed to see his ID.  I reminded her he had ordered water.  She said she still needed to see his ID because it was a \"weird Arizona law\".  I told her that made no sense and reminded her I had just told her he was 19.  She said she could not serve us if he was underage.  I was incredulous at this stage and so asked if we could just get food.  She said she could not serve us anything if he was underage - again stating this was an Arizona law.  She then went on to say that she could check with her manager and he might be able to allow it.  We were then left for more than 10 minutes before another waiter asked if we were being helped.  We told him our story and he said, as we suspected, that this was not a law but a restaurant policy due to issues with underage drinking.  He also said the manager would need to determine if we could be served.  The manager  did a few minutes later condescendingly judge us as suitable to be served - at that stage we decided to leave.  I have no issues with any bar/restaurant making effort to address underage drinking, but to lie about their policy and say it is state law is unacceptable and to treat customers like crap is even worse.",

Anyone who knew this is a new product from Julian Wright's family ( owner of Canteen + la bocca + handlebar) would expect at least minimum service at this new bar, but ironically this bar is AWFUL at service. It took the waitress 20 min to attend us ( they were soo busy with their girl talk near their booths), we got our beers after 10 min and that was it. We didn't see them until after 30 minutes even after making constant eye contact and as a desperate attempt I had to whistle, got our check and left! RUINED my date night:-( . We felt like our business is not appreciated at all! There are a lot of friendly bars on Mill Ave. ...Handlebar and Julian Wright, you can do better than that!",

That should have been a big clue not to go in, but we really wanted to check this place out.        The beer seems over-priced; 12 oz. beer for the price of 16 oz. at comparable places, and the selection was not impressive.  As for the food, quite bluntly, it sucked!  We had a burger, brat and split the large fries.  (We wanted a pretzel, but they were out!  They supposedly make them \"fresh\" daily, but were out since Friday night.  Hmm, couldn't make any today???)    The burger and brat had no taste what so ever.  Very disappointing.  The fries were good, but the \"large\" is served in a paper  pouch the same size as a Small fries at McDonald's.  Seriously, this is a Large??????      We were going to check this place out sooner or later.  I'm glad it was sooner.  I won't be back, and I'm shocked at the positive reviews of this place.

THEN we stumble upon \"The Handlebar\" in Tempe.  This place had a great atmosphere, HAPPY HOUR (every day of the week including SUN), misters that hit cha no matter where you sat and GREAT staff!  There was a gentleman (manager?) who stopped by 3 times in our short visit just to make sure everything about our visit was satisfactory.  NICE!  Their menu could stand to be a little expanded but my friend did try the brat and I agree w/the one bite I took, TASTY!  I couldn't decide on the beer I wanted so the server suggested to let her bring me a few taste glasses to help me decide.  They also have the coolest big long rectangle fire pit w/seating all around the edge-very classy looking.  Last but not least, the crowd is mature!  Not your average \"Mill Ave\" hang out which is nice for most of us \"non-20sums\".  If you're looking for a nice outdoor atmosphere in Tempe w/great staff/customer service and decent pricing...this is your joint!",

First night there we were there early so we had dinner.  The brats and fries are AMAZING!  The fries are tossed in garlic and are thick and crispy. Soo good!  For drinks I ordered the Paper Route which is THE BEST THING EVER.  It's a can of PBR, shot of Jameson, and a cigarette all for 7 bucks.    I can't say enough great things about this place, however they did mess up my friend's tab one night.  When she went to close out they said she already had even though she hadn't.  She goes home and checks her bank account and she was charged $47 even though she had only had a couple drinks.  They did the right thing and reimbursed her, and since it didn't happen to me it's not going to affect my rating.  Just an FYI.",

I sat at bar and there was a more festive asu crowd watching the devils lose. Happy hour had good drink specials and i also tried the fresh cut fries, which were just average as these didnt have skin on and were kinda stubby.

The place has a great ambiance, the servers and bartenders ROCK IT and the drinks are perfect. As a vegetarian, the food isn't exactly what I look for in a \"restaurant,\" but this ain't no restaurant so my expectations are for bar food and those expectations are met.  That being said, as much as I LOVE this place, if you're over 22 and you're not into chest-bumping, the \"OH MY GAWDS!\" and the young adult hormones raging vibe, let's find a hookup tonight or else, then stay away from this place on Thursday, Friday or Saturday nights at all costs! The service is still outstanding, but you'll start feeling all closed in and like you're in a bad 80s Porky's film.   Other than that, go! Enjoy!",

We wanted to try a place we had never been before, so we wandered into Handlebar around 1am and found the place empty except for a bartender and waitress. We knew it was late on Monday night, but I don't think either of us were expecting to be the only ones in the joint.  We sat up at the bar and the bartender started telling us about their Brown Bag special on Mondays. For $8, you get a domestic tall boy, a shot of Fireball/Jager/Jameson, and your choice of either a popsicle, ice cream sandwich, or pack of cigarettes. I had never had anything like it before and I elected to pass that night, but I was intrigued and might have to go back to give it a shot.  Anyways, you'll find a pretty wide selection of beer at Handlebar, and our bartender was more than happy to walk my friend through the differences between IPAs and ales. He let us sample a handful of different chocolate-y beers before we settled on our drinks of choice, and he even handed us the remote to change the TV channel. It's a nice spot on Mill if you want a break from the typical party vibe on the avenue.",

My work group has been there several times for happy hour and the patio is great for accommodating big groups. The roll up walls are nice when the weather is cool creating one open space so the inside and outside flow together.   I went back for lunch the other day and all I can say is \"QUINOA BURGER!\" I can't believe how delicious it was, packed with Cheddar Cheese, Carrots, Zucchini, Feta, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and Cucumber Dill Sauce. Absolutely amazing. Of course I added bacon to enhance the experience so it definitely wasn't a vegetarian option.   I'm adding Handlebar to my regular rotation for Mill Ave lunches.",

On top of it all, the bartenders are always awesome! If I knew their names I'd give them kudos but usually it's the same two or three that always serve me when I stop in. They're all funny but very attentive as well. I never feel like I have to flag someone down when I need something, because they just know! I love that this isn't the typical party place.

It seems like Handlebar has just improved over time, offering a wider selection of food (fish and chips and a number of vegetarian items) and the beer selection continues to stay varied and interesting with some excellent happy hour specials (I believe 3 pm to 6:30 pm). I do like that they work on serving each type of beer in a glass appropriate to that style of beer, something that stands out as a differentiator in regards to their approach to beer and they seem to now have a wider selection of Belgian beers in the large bottles.  I went early on a Friday evening with my father and while the music was elevated it was not too loud, and the music was interesting and varied. We sat at the long bar and the wait staff was friendly and regularly checked on us so our water glasses and my beer glass were  refreshed as needed. I had two beers from the happy hour list, which has about 10 or 12 craft beers so nice to take advantage of the lower prices without feeling one is missing out on a quality selection.  All I can say, when I go to see a movie on Mill, I always seem to end up at Handlebar for a beer and a bite so I think I can clearly say I fall into the fan category. I also like that the place is good for people watching, big outside patio and an open area and a long bar so that you can almost always find a space there early in the evening.",

Me and my friend were there for a special beer release event. We ordered a couple regular drinks and a couple of the tasters. None of the beers had any prices on the menu. The menu was a hanging chalkboard. Most of the way through our visit they added prices on to the chalkboard and to our dismay we discovered that many of the prices did not match what the server told us when we ordered. We found when the tabs were delivered at the end of the night all of the prices we were charged matched what they later wrote on the board instead of what we were told at the time we ordered them. Additionally our server never brought us the waters we asked for and also advised us that one of the beers was tapped out even though it was supposed to be part of the event (which hadn't even been going 30 minutes yet) and the place was not very busy. This told me they obviously had been selling this beer well before the listed start time for the event.  I did have a couple appetizers while I was there. They have Pretzel Knots on the menu but be aware these are not soft pretzels, they are literally the mini crunchy pretzels you can buy in the snack packs at the grocery store served with a side of beer cheese. We also ordered a side of french fries as well. We got the 1lb side order to share which came with 2 dipping sauces. I chose beer cheese for my dipping sauce for the fries as well which I'm glad I did because the beer cheese turned out to be quite good. Overall a very mediocre experience all things considered.",

It was funny, though, another waitress was just giving us more napkins and she was really awesome and personable and on the ball and I was like, \"Damn, why couldn't we get her?\"  Their drinks and food are usually pretty solid.  Last night, I ordered a burger, but, man.... a burger doesn't come with fries?  Some other stuff happened with my girlfriend being double charged on her card and stuff but the manager was cool about that.  But, man... no goddamn fries with a burger?  I was like, huh, damn, I could've used some fries and didn't feel like tacking on another five bucks or so to get some.  I came home, went online, and found this little gem on The Onion.  That very night.  It was perfect:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theonion.com%2Farticles%2Fbatshit-insane-restaurant-believes-fries-must-be-p%2C30424%2F&s=55296f96e3dd8018f72dbb22cc12dd2b30fbc865b2492cf00a4542fda027ac92\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">theonion.com/articles/ba...</a>  Weird... such perfect timing.

There are 6 of us at the table this night (Saturday prior to this review) and out of the 6 beers we order, they are out of 4.  Ummm THUD.  Oh let me rephrase, they were out of 5, cause when they brought one of the beers they said they had they really didn't have it and changed his order to a Kiltlifter without asking.  THUD again.  How does a beer garden on a Saturday night not have beer?  Onto the food.  I love sausages and they have 4 of them on the menu, I think two or three burgers and a few salads.  Like 7 items total.  So a brat and beer sounded good.  Oh...were out of all sausage.  THUD.  Enough for me.  7 menu items, out of 4, beer garden out of at least 5 beers on tap (could have been more who knows) tells me all I need to know.  Buh bye.",

My granddaughter (7) had a Cheese Burger with nothing else. She is the pickiest eater I know. Amazingly enough she ate the whole thing. Her burger really smelled good.       I had the fish and chips. Which were also very nice. Wonderful fish under a thin layer of crust. Perfect. I hate to much crust on fish. I feel like they are hiding something. The fish and tartar sauce were wonderful.       We all had the fries with our meal. They have a wonderful seasoning on them. If they cooked them crisp like the Belgians do, they'd have the best fries in town.      The beer selection is amazing. You can even get obscure beers and ales in 22oz bottles. Some are not so cheap but if you want to say you've try this or that to brag to friends about your beer snobbishness, then this is the place.      My next trip will include one of those beers as a treat, though I've already had the best beer in the world. I'm not snobby, just lucky to know good brews.",

You know, the street that claims one of the largest New Years Eve block parties in the country. Also, it's worth having a hostesses when a festival is happening, then your six seated tables aren't occupied by 2 people and parties of 6 are wondering where they can sit. Having said that, the food was good, even though it took an hour to receive it. I learned quickly to order another beer as soon as I received one. At least then you stood a chance of getting it around the time the first one was done.",

This is a great laid back feel with a nice atmosphere to just hang and have a bite with a beer.    They have a lot of good munchies on the menu along with a huge beer selection.  My favorite as far as food goes?  The pretzels with cheese! Mmmmm!  The beer menu is large, but not so large you feel overwhelmed like World of Beer down the street.    They have a nice patio that I enjoyed drinking on many times in the spring. :)  But the inside isn't bad either, the bar area is pretty big and the tables in the back are cool if you're with a group.  Parking is to be desired.  I mean, it's on Mill so you can't really have high expectations as far as parking goes.  For that I do not fault them. :)  If you are near by and haven't tried this place I highly recommend it, especially if you aren't much on the Mill scene.",

We like to bring our dog Rudolph everywhere we go and since we are walking distance to Mill, we decided he should come too. As we approached Handlebar my boyfriend was scoping out places to tie Rudolph up outside the bar. I asked the security guard if Rudolph was allowed on the patio and he said sure. After we order some beers from the outside bar, another security guard had one of the workers fetch Rudolph some water. This gesture was small but seriously sweet. It's little things like that that will keep me coming back to a place. My boyfriend had a great experience with one of the bartenders as well. He told the bartender what kind of beer he liked and the bartender brought out three samples for him to try.   Overall, we had a great time with our dog. Rudolph was a big hit with the patrons of the bar. Most everyone that walked by wanted to touch him. We will DEFINITELY be back.   The only reason the 4 stars isn't a 5 is because there weren't any drink specials. I know it was a Friday night, but you should have at least some promo going on at one time. It cost $5.50 for a 12oz IPA. That is more like LA prices!!! I know you can do better than that Handlebar :)",

And to be honest, I was more than a little bummed when we left to head off to the next place.  The patio is great! A little warm in the summer (which is unsurprising, considering the Arizona heat), but the misters definitely made it feel like I wasn't standing on the sun. It's very open with a lot of seating and feels a lot more relaxed in comparison to some of the other patios on Mill.  And the waitress who was serving us was really nice and ridiculously attentive.  They have an amazing beer selection, which definitely made my night. They also offer some ridiculously tasty beer cocktails. I got a shandy, which was perfect, considering just how hot it was. My friend let me have a taste of her peach tandem and it was also ridiculously good. My only grouse, and it's a small one, is that the only cider they had (at the time, at least) was Crispin. That's not to say Crispin's a bad cider, because it isn't, I just wish they had more of a selection.  Despite the fact that we were heading off to dinner afterwards, we did end up ordering some pretzels and fries. Both of which were very good and I highly recommend. Especially with their beer cheese, which is fabulous.  TL;DR: Good food, good drinks, good service. Definitely have to pop in again before I move.",

It's got an amazing patio which works during the sholder seasons - I saw a few dogs out and about too, so they appear to be dog-friendly. So for me, the atmosphere works, or at least on a lazy afternoon it does! Service was friendly and informative on the local brews on which I typically imbibe. The fries were well-cooked and not too greasy - Although, it did seem small for the price. It's not a deal-breaker for me because I don't need too many fries to begin with.  I'll be back, maybe during late night to see how much of a party school ASU really is - I'll put my New Orleans-trained liver up to the test.",

I don't understand how it takes 40 minutes to make a burger & fries.  The waitress who served us was also rude and inconsiderate about the wait time. The manager tried to be nice and took off a round of drinks although we were charged for full price drinks instead of the happy hour price so it ended up not doing anything to the bill. At that point I was not willing to wait another 10 minutes to speak to someone about the bill so we just left. The vibe of the bar is more grungy which makes it more like a biker bar. Also the happy hour pricing is not amazing, they are similar compared to any other bar on Mill.",

The only downside that I had: the bartender seemed to favor cigarettes over cigars when it came to how they set up their smoking policy on their patio, which a real shame. Lots of cigar smokers would likely enjoy this place if they weren't exiled to the back corner of the patio. Too bad the poison smoke from cigarettes seems to be favored as opposed to the natural smoke from cigars. Oh well, can't be perfect, I guess....",

The Handlebar is a bike friendly American beer garden with 48 beers including local, European & American craft selected by self-proclaimed \"beer geek\" Nick Nitz, a full bar, 8 wines by the glass & beer cocktails. (see pics)  THE MENU   The menu includes salads, sandwiches, pretzels, hand cut fries, vegetarian & various sausages, which I had. (see pics)  AMBIANCE   There is indoor/outdoor bar seating & a 2,000 square foot patio with park benches, street lamps & a cozy fire pit.   Trivia: The wood in the bar is a reclaimed barn from the Midwest brought to Arizona piece by piece.   I love the diverse crowd that The Handlebar always brings. I have met my attorney friends here, locals, students & my pilot friends as well as some international exchange students from Switzerland.  CONCLUSION   The Handlebar is a fantastic place to get a beer and hangout with friends or meet new people.   4/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Hours: 11am - 2pm daily Happy Hour: 3pm - 6pm daily  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FHandlebarAZ.com&s=174b7d152f0b636a66ffd240fe1923643b1392d730477149bb44a0c511938b11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">HandlebarAZ.com</a>",

I don't really know the details of how or why this is the place, but everyone knows where its at, and getting an uber to drop you off on university and mill and walking is usually super easy.  The drinks I've had here are pretty stiff, but there's almost never any seating inside on a busy night, but move outside to the patio and you'll find some seating there... The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.   I mean it doesn't blow my socks off to be here, but hey, its a bar on mill, what can you expect?",

    "text": "I had a great time here as a post-conference social with about 30 friends and conference participants. We went straight to the very back outdoor area. There are plenty of tables back there, but there's also just a large space by the fire. It worked out perfectly for us, and we were able to just hang out, enjoy some drinks (great beer selection), and get groovy with it when the beat was right. (We may have turned our little corner into a dance club, even though Handlebar was very clearly not a dance club.)   The drinks here seem to be pretty average priced. Didn't get a chance to eat anything here though -- but definitely want to come back for some food sometime!  Would definitely recommend Handlebar if you're looking to just casually hang out, grab a beer, or some food. It gets pretty loud inside with all of the TVs on when it's packed. Really big space though.",

We were there on a Thursday and they had 2 for 1 Jamison or Green tea shots which were very good, i only sipped on them, once again because I'm a little to old for shots. Our waitress was nice, we had 6 to 8 people at our table at different times during the evening. The patio was nice even on a cool January evening with the heat lamps...we're from Montana so it was a treat to sit on a patio. The Crowd in the whole area was very young,however the night turned out great even for us middle agers",

Been here in the past, the liquor selection, beers on tap and the food have always been great. This trip included an order of their Fish & Chip, and the tuna, and one of their chicken sandwiches, all with their awesome seasoned fries.  I paired my meal with a Kilt Lifter (I know, I'm boring, but I like it) while the girls ordered Ballast Point Sculpin, and a Oskar Blues G'Knight respectively. Seems I'm the odd one out without an IPA...   All and all a good place to pop in for lunch. I have noticed like any other place located on Mill, parking can be a problem from time to time.",

I've gotten the guyere burger, backyard bbq burger, and the fresh bratwurst grilled cheese style.  guyere burger is AMAZING. just make sure to tell your waitress to cook it at most, medium. the backyard bbq burger is also delicious and should be cooked medium at most. these burgers will forever be my #1 favorite, top of the top, and standard for all burgers.  the bratwurst was amazing! especially grilled cheese style. it comes with two sides of sauces and fries. i got the beer cheese and raw onions. grilled cheese style makes the bratwurst come out with sandwich bread and cheese (like a grilled cheese lol). the sausage was beautiful. had the snap that i look for in hot dogs.   the fries were amazing too! however, it can come a little bit salty. they're thicker cut but not too thick. they're cooked to perfection.  parking can be found everywhere, both on the streets and in the structure shared with the plaza.",

I feel like you wouldn't go to this bar for dancing , or to get turnt up , and if you are looking for school of Rock crowd or a cultural mixing pot this may not be your bar on the average night.   The crowd , seems to be a mixture of college students and older (classic dad's with teenage at home) age groups. Seems like you get college students who get dressed up to sit at a table and hangout with good friends. And on flip older folk doing the same but in shorts, hats and some relaxing running sneakers.   But I. Honestly feel like this bar does one thing great and that is space. They really do give every group space from each other. This isn't a bar where you meet people , it seems like one where you bring you own group and live in your own space and this bar does a great job in creating that space. Tons of tables , and even more outside. Plenty room to move around but also  plenty room to fit multiple big groups .   Didn't try the food, and I actually went a little weak and had their ciders but good selection on tap .",

Nice patio w. large windows that open for outside bar seating.  They started w/ a basic menu: brats, sausages, burgers, fries and theyre adding and changing things gradually. The brats w/ grilled onions is almost always my 1st choice. Their fries are soooo good. Be warned that they dont come w/ the burgers, they do , however, come w/ your choice of delicious aiolis. I love the black pepper ranch and the bacon blue cheese (and i usually hate blue cheese!). I will say, if you order a burger make sure its cooked how you asked it to be. The one time I strayed from my brat, i ordered my burger midwell, and got it mid rare. Sending it back seemed a chore as the waitress didnt understand my complaint.  The waitresses are not great, but the bartenders are stellar. Theyre always willing to help you find your perfect beer. Very attentive, talkative, and give all around great service, even when its crazy busy.  And the beer selection, yum. It changes so dont expect to find something youve had their prior on your next visit. Ive made that mistake more than once.  I really hope this place survives!",

The arugula was bad and over all not a good salad for $13 (chicken added). My husbands chicken sandwich was very dry and over cooked. Fries were the best part about the entire thing. We did feel bad for the waitress as she was running the entire floor while the manager just stood and watched. Sad to say we won't be back. Head here for drinks and fries but nothing else.",

The girl bartender who helped us didn't attend to us until about 5 minutes after we sat down at the bar, and not because it was busy, but because she was chatting with the other bartender at the opposite end. 5 minutes, eh no biggie, but when she did come over, she seemed less than thrilled to be there and serve us. The vibe after that was just kind of blah. She never came back around for us to order round two so we instead flagged her down to close out and take our business next door to Zipps for the rest of our happy hour which then turned into hours ;)",

    "text": "The atmosphere at Handlebar is absolutely fantastic. The patio is magazine-ad perfect.. you seriously feel like you're in a hip urban environment, doing hip, urban things... and in hip, urban style!  The beer selection is vast.. I don't drink, but I find the beer menu impressive. The food menu is fairly limited, but that's actually a fantastic thing. I've so often eaten at beer focused spots that have giant menus with nothing but really terrible food to offer.  Handlebar's selection is burgers, fries, pretzels, salads, and sausage sandwiches. REALLY TASTY burgers, fries, pretzels, salads, and sausage sandwiches!! The meats are locally sourced! The flavors are brave. The fries come with a variety of dipping sauces, and each of them are exquisite.. the fries themselves are at least the best I've ever had. Really. They are. I have never made such a proclamation in regard to fries! So good! I guess they recently revamped the pretzels. I did not have their previous iteration, but the new ones are 3 sticks of carbtastic glory. They are served with a spicy mustard, and BEER CHEESE to dip in.. and the BEER CHEESE = the truth! I'd seriously eat it off of dirt. It's that good!  Be sure to stop in on Wednesday nights, around 8pm.  Team trivia, headed up by an actual host! Fun times, and super fantastic prizes!",

Great beer selection. Dog friendly (they bring water filled bowls out for the pups). Big open patio areas and plenty of places for your dog to be comfy. Great fries & dipping sauces.   Cons: Awful service. Awful food. The bar staff is the worst I've encountered. Major attitude & overall a lack of respect towards the customers that frequent this establishment. I'm shocked that nothing has been done to invest in a better team. We've hosted a birthday, brought numerous visitors, office happy hours and it's consistently the same.   As bad as the food & service is, we continue to spend money here. We do love the fact that it's dog friendly and they don't limit the hours you can bring the dogs. The other patrons here are always friendly. The service on the patio has been much better than the service you receive on the inside.   Hope to see things change in the future - it's such a great place & the layout cannot be beat. \"Management\", you really need to bring in a new crew who like to work, are friendly and have some social skills.",

Take advantage of their 1/2 price drinks and appetizers, best deal on Mill Ave. The atmosphere is great, a large patio with long tables and bench seating, plenty of room for a large group. The inside is nice too, big bar and side walls that roll up to make the inside seem like part of the outside patio.

Sat down waited a good while till I was served got asked if I had been helped or not \"unorganized\" we asked for a vodka lemonade tonic something refreshing and good got asked for our ids mind you I've come to mill for years before I even became of age with a fake I'd been of age for 3 yrs as well as my friend he bent her I'd and even after proof with her passport was convinced it was fake bent my I'd tht I had just ordered and used days before in portland and az he refused to serve us drinks... Not a big deal so we ordered I wanted to order the cheese fries to find out they are out of fries. So no drink and literally being out of half of ther limited menu I have a very distaste left in my mouth will not be returning Ever... And will not be recommending this place ever instead go across the street to la bocca and have an amazing sangria and much better service 0 stars and to my server who I'm assuming is a manager of some sort you may need to brush up on ur I'd checking because tht was awful service and experience.  To continue this the owner of the restaurant emailed us and offered his sincerest apology and said tht the situation will b taken care of very pressed with the promptness and concern",

So last Sunday afternoon we stopped in and grabbed an outside table and waited... and waited... and waited... and waited. My son even stepped up to the bar for service and the bartender told him he'd be back in a minute but that turned into five more. So we stood up to leave and our server appeared. She popped a few menus down and strode off, not to be seen for about 10 more minutes. I'm just getting started here! We ordered a beer or two, which they didn't have. We went down their list of beers and they were out of six - 6!! beers that we wanted to try. You're kidding, right? Nope. So we ultimately ordered something she said they had and she came back a few minutes later with another beer entirely. Yep, they were out of another beer. We ordered food, why oh why? Got our dried out pressed patties of beef (?) with literally no dressing whatsoever. The Classic Burger should have had a bacon bleu cheese dressing - it was absent just like the beer in this place. Score Card - Service, blech. Beer selection, blech. Food, blech. Handlebar - you had your chance and I'm never coming back. Sorry.",

But I was pleasantly surprised by Handlebar not only for their selection of beers but for their wonderful service. As soon as we stepped into the bar the bouncers were incredibly polite and after we got in our bartender Ryan was THE best. He started with asking us what we usually look for in a beer and what we usually get. I said I like Blue Moon and the bf said his favorite beer- Four Peaks \"Kilt Lifter.\" He then went on to recommend the perfect beers for us; he explained each beer with great detail and was very convincing. The bf first drank the Celebrator Doppelback and then a Monk's Cafe Flemish and loved them both (I'm not a fan of the beer the bf likes, but even I liked them). For me, since I like the light, but flavorful taste of Blue Moon' drank their Leffe Blonde and it was amazing. I should have known this was going to be a great bar since I am already a fan of La Bocca Pizzeria and Canteen, who are run by the same owners. I haven't tried the food yet but I definitely recommend everyone to give it a try!",

The service was kind of slow, the beers were really expensive compared to other locations with craft beers on draft. The sausage I got was ok...The fries and the dipping sauces were really good. The atmosphere is pretty good, but honestly I would rather be at one of the bars over in the Maple/Ash area. I might go back and try some other food from them, but probably not order the beer, Taste of Tops is better for that stuff...",

We have stopped by several times since, hadn't seen Mark again, but  this time it was 7 months later and Mark remembered us, I barely remembered the situation but he did. He walked up to us with two beers in his hand and said which one you  want.  Phenomenal personal service.  You don't find that conscientious service these days very often. Very very impressed.  Would highly recommend the personal service they provide.",

It's a nice switch up from the Scottsdale club influence that seems to be taking over other bars on mill. Handle has a great beer selection and their happy hour includes half off brews.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I found this place while exploring Mill Ave for some cocktails. The place appeared to have room at the bar and looked very inviting. Definitely a cool looking place with a beautiful patio. We sat ourselves at a table that I could barely rest my arms on cause they were pretty tall and was promptly greeted by a pretty waitress. I ordered the Old Fashioned ($8) while my bf ordered the Moscow Mule (also $8). We also ordered a \"large\" portion of the sweet potato fries ($5)  My drink was VERY strong with little taste of any bitters. I would have preferred to have a better blended drink but having it be strong was good enough for me. My BF liked his drink, it seemed to be better blended. The big disappointment was the sweet potato fries, which stinks cause I love sweet potato fries normally. I feel like we got all the little crumbs left behind before they made a fresh batch. It did come with two dipping sauces which were good, especially the tomato basil. My BF said the BBQ sauce was a bit spicy but he liked it. We couldn't even really enjoy the sauces so much cause the fries weren't even fries just (very) salty crumbs that I ended up trying to use a utensil to eat cause we paid money for them and I was determined to eat them, I eventually gave up. My BF wanted me to return them cause they were such a joke but I just couldn't bc I work in the industry and know that annoyance.  We wanted to try a burger or something cause we were so hungry but after the disappointing fries we decided against it. I'm sure the fries aren't always that bad but for us it was a big turn off.  If you want strong drinks (lots of beer options too) in a hip bar on Mill Ave with lots of TVs and space to sit down and you're not very hungry, this place is worth checking out.",

    "text": "Decent food. Pretty good drinks. Reasonable prices. Horrible service.  Pros: The burger and fries were good enough to warrant a return trip. The beer selection was pretty good. Couldn't complain about the drink prices. The manager was pretty helpful, and gave me an industry discount (I'm a bartender) when he brought the check.  Cons: Absolutely the worst service I've had in years, by far! We sat down on the patio, where most of the other guests were, for ten minutes before the manager came over and asked if we had been helped. He got us some water and sent the server over. He took our orders and later dropped off the food and drinks. We didn't see him again for quite a long time. I was at a bar and my drink was gone and had no way of getting a new one. Every time the waiter was at our table, it was because the manager had told him to go there.   I had to ask the manager for my bill because the server was nowhere to be found and I no longer had any interest in staying. Once again, the manager handled the situation very well (sending the waiter over and discounting the bill). After we had the bill, the waiter seemed to magically remember we existed. He was hovering over us while i was taking my wallet out and watching me put money in the book. It was really uncomfortable.  The moment the book closed, the waiter had it in his hands. He ran over to the computer looked obviously upset at his small tip. (as a service worker myself i rarely tip below 15% even for crappy service. this service warranted $1 however.)   Nobody expects incredible service in a bar. It's a real laid-back place. I do expect some service though. It is, after all, why their salary is based on tips. The server made us feel more than unwelcome in the bar, but actually feel like our presence was a burden. Our experience could have been completely if we had a decent server. Our server was not simply bad, he was neglectful of his job. I took my business down the street to world of beer and tipped my excellent waiter $30 on my $100 tab. I may give handlebar another shot, but I will be sitting at the bar if i do. The server in question was a tall red-haired male.    i really liked the beer I had there too. I wish I could have bought 10 more. If only there was someone to serve them to me.",

We had the batter fried cod and subbed sweet potato fries for reg fries- our buddies split a burger- it is mostly burgers & brats on the menu. Both meals were decent but nothing to write home about. The service was outstanding- our red-headed server, I think his name was Tyler was head and shoulders above any server I've ever had. Just a really likable character and he was there when we needed him without being intrusive. he seemed to really like his job. (which you don't see too often).

After an extremely thorough examination of our IDs he reluctantly agreed to take our drink order. The burger I ordered was $10 and comes on a bun that I recognize from my grade school cafeteria and no side. I had to really flag down the bartender to ask for my check, which never came. I had to ask another person behind the bar to final get a check delivered. Not compelled to darken the doorway at Handlebar ever again.",

The servers are friendly and attentive, they play good music (Smiths seemed to show up a lot), and the beer selection is great. Wednesday was Happy Hour all day, and the discount was better than we expected.   For the vegetarians in your group, they offer a really delicious quinoa burger- highly recommend! The pretzel with cheese is also amazing, and the grilled cheese is probably the best I have had anywhere (sorry mom).  We don't like sports bars with TVs on every wall, so Handlebar was a nice compromise- people could watch the game but it did not take over the entire establishment.",

Unfortunately, the music does get pretty loud, but it's still the best place for people who want to sit and drink on a Friday or Saturday near ASU and the only place on Mill to take your parents on those days, (2) the beer and food - both are fantastic all the time. I haven't had anything I didn't like there and (3) the sinks are outside of the bathrooms so you can wash your hands before you eat without having to wait in line to get into the bathroom or touch a bathroom door handle or anything horrible like that.",

My friends and I were out tonight and trying to enjoy a few beers before a friend moves out of the country. He ordered a Shirley temple along with another friend's dirty Shirley Temple and the bartender was instantly irritated. He walked away, rolled his eyes and shook his head. It was disappointing to see as a fellow bartender. He returned with a cocktail bucket of Shirley temple along with the same size dirty Shirley. He then didn't take much time to take other orders from the rest of the party. I stayed to reconcile and ask for a full size soda and he seemed to judge the fact that we were still ordering a soda. As a bartender myself, I know money is money. We were willing to pay and tip. His rudeness made me and my friends feel unhappy in this restaurant.",

We ordered the pretzels with beer cheese which were nothing special. The beer cheese was fine, but when asked about the stone ground mustard that the menu boasted.... the server gestured sadly to the Heinz, Grey Poupon, and Gulden's on the table. Um, that's not stone ground, Handlebar. My grilled cheese (which was reportedly nominated for some best grilled cheese award?) was meh as well. I used a good amount of stone ground mustard (jk, it was Gulden's) to make it more interesting. I'm still trying to figure out why they charged so much.  They have some very classy beer selections available. I ended up requesting the Noche Dulce vanilla porter. The server accidentally brought out a strawberry ale, which was surprisingly tasty. A really great summer beer. When I got my Noche Dulce though... perfection. Deliciously hearty and great flavor.   All in all, I wouldn't flock here for food. I wouldn't flock here for the service. I would stop in for a beer at the bar before a date and then gtfo with my bearded, glasses adorned date on his tandem bike.",

This place has a pretty unique vibe that lets it stand out from most of the other bars that are downtown on Mill Ave. The patio area is a perfect spot to grab a beer and relax with friends no matter what time of year. The place gets pretty rowdy on the weekends but its still a pretty cool joint.",

I ordered a med well Gruyere burger it came out dry as sawdust. The fries were so over done we asked them for a new basket and they were still just too dry. They tasted like they  were frozen. My co-diner said the burger was like  chewing an old dish sponge. I was so disappointed because I was getting over a hang over and I just wanted something tasty after a whole day of tummy aches. Well I ended up puking up that burger later because of the hangover, but I think more because my body could feel my regret. I shall never step foot in that place again. Sorry I know all the cool kids love it but I prefer places with good food over beer.",

    "text": "Great new addition to Mill Ave.   First stopped by here for a Monday Happy Hour, and instantly loved it. This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)  Also made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed. I was hoping it would remain a little more of the chill day-time vibe, but come 10pm the music gets cranked up, and my group decided to move on to a place where we could actually have conversation without screaming.   (sidenote: every bartender / waitress I've dealt with here has been really, super nice.)  Def. worth a shot I'd say, and I could see it being a fave HH place.",

Go to the bar to order a beer on draft, wait 8 minutes while the two, then one bartender completely ignores your section of the bar. Upon conversation about said beer, are told they do not have it and then immediately starts to walk away. No questions about what else I wanted, no suggestions for further beer choices, literally is five steps away after he told me they didn't have what I wanted. I'll tentatively say I won't return. They have good beers and events but the staff ruins the experience. I'm sure there are some good employees, sadly those who are not ruin the experience.",

When I arrived, it was not too busy but as the day wore on and the ASU game was close to starting it became quite busy. At that point, the poor bartender was literally running her butt off but keeping up with the crowd. I had a chicken sammy which was fine. Nothing out of the ordinary but solid. The fries are hand cut in house and very good. You also can pick your dipping sauce for your fries. I had spicy BBQ and it was good---it was spicy but not overly spicy.   As the afternoon went on, there were more and more college students arriving. Looked like a fun place to hang out, especially for students at the end of a long week. Parking in the area is not trivial. The patio is large and a great place to relax as when the weather is nice (which in Arizona is most of the time).",

We ordered a chicken burger and that was delicious. Fries are bomb!   The grilled cheese with chicken that we ordered did not come with chicken and was quite a disappointment. I thoroughly disliked it and threw most of it away. It was horrible cooked.  I would like to add that the barback was super cool and attentive to us and I'm fairly certain he had noticed the bartender sucked at his job therefore he stepped up to provide better service to us- thankful for him.   Next time we come back I hope to give 5 stars.",

Your bouncer broke my wife's ID (by bending it) and then had the nerve not to let my 60 year old father in law in after he complained about it. For the record, he broke it a day before we have to fly back to LA. He was unapologetic and unrepentant. In fact, he had the nerve to laugh at her after breaking her ID. Stay away from this bar. Stereotypical frat boy toxic mentality permeated throughout the staff. Be better.",

I'll say again, the beer selection is superb! The space definitely brings a much needed \"craft\" scene to Mill Ave. I've only had food here once a couple years ago. I think it was decent, not incredibly memorable (though that could be on account of the high abv's)   Okay, so on to why the 2 stars. The service was absolutely horrendous! Incredibly so. My friend and I went in on a Saturday afternoon around 230 pm. The place had a lazy feel, from the staff to the handful of guests there. We were not greeted by anyone, not even a smile! Despite an almost empty bar, it took at least 10 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge our existence. When they did, not an ounce of happiness. I get it, it's Mill Ave and slow, probably not making the best money, but if you don't like it, don't work on Mill and take your terrible attitude somewhere else! The bartenders seemed to be really interested in washing glasses and staring at the floor. Maybe we were expecting too much by asking for suggestions on the house cocktails! *shrugs* overall, incredibly disappointing, slow, just simply well below average service. This place has ALL the potential to be a destination spot for Tempe, there's just something missing...",

Fact: it sucked.   The service was horrible because we hardly had any. It took about 20 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for the food to come out. My girlfriend's order was wrong, and mine took an additional 10 minutes after hers and my sister's came out.   If only the food were good. Their brats were flavorless, and their buns fell apart too easy. The only delicious thing was the Thai ketchup. Everything else was mediocre to average at best. You could probably make it better yourself.   I wanted to like it because the atmosphere/environment is interesting/hip (in an urban hipster way) and it has the same owner as La Bocca, which I love. It's just... I wasn't drunk enough to think any of it was worth it.",

The burgers and fried where great and they have a blue cheese bacon sauce for dipping and burger that rocks.  The handles included some favorites from Bels, left hand, firestone, and locals from four peaks.  Warm vibe with lots of wood and clean industrial lines.

    "text": "On a strip of bars catering to a college-age crowd, this modern American beer garden with a large patio that is friendly to both dog and bike, offers a fantastic selection of draft beers ranging from Austrian to Belgian to Arizonan.  This is also one of the only places in the valley, that I have discovered, that offers beer cocktails.  Try the signature HANDLEBAR SHANDY with Stiegl Goldbrau lager, San Pellegrino Limonata, Agave Nectar, and a sprig of Rosemary to top it off.  For $6 this is an outstanding value.    The space itself is open and inviting, combining rustic wooden table and bartops, exposed brick on walls and ceilings, and a lot of natural light coming in from the centerpiece of the room - the bar - which is 60 feet long and has both indoor and outdoor seating.    The food here is made to order in the cozy little grilling area situated in the corner of the bar.  Keep this in mind when coming here on a busy night - you might wait a while for your food.  But luckily the menu is simple and consists of local gourmet bratwurst, polish sausage, italian, and a smoked turkey sausage.  For $5 you can select up two toppings such as sauerkraut or pickled fresno peppers.  For sides you have the option of regular or sweet potato hand cut fries, and for $3 with a dipping sauce of your choice they are unbeatable.  Highly recommend the decadent bleu cheese bacon dip!  It also tastes amazing on the burger as well as the brat.  The kitchen is open late night for food, which beats getting a pizza or taco on Mill after a night of carousing.  Weekly events are Scrabble nights on Mondays, Ladie's night on Tuesdays, Trivia night on Wednesdays  Great neighborhood bar, great place to stop in for lunch or a late night bite, great place for beers!",

People have this damn sense of entitlement and \"the customer is always right\" attitude that baffles me. Perhaps I'm biased as I'm in a service industry, but whatever.   I have to say that my experiences at Handlebar have been great, so far. The bartenders are are friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable. We went there with a group of 10+ (some came and some went over the course of a few hours) and they were right on with the service, even with the water refills, which is important to me. I just like the place and enjoy riding my bike up there. Next time I'll get some names to give kudos too, but for now I have to say everyone I've been helped by there seemed very nice.",

    "text": "So nice to get back to hanging out in Tempe, and the temptation came from the opening of The Handlebar & Grill.  After my inquiring on the website for location info, I was warmly responded to by the owner, Julian Wright, obviously a dedicated restaurant owner and hard working man who makes you feel very appreciated and welcomed.   I love big patio spaces, and the extra draw for me is theirs being dog friendly.  This is a great place for all bike riders as well since they have several nice bike racks through out.  Their outdoor patio space is plentiful and very relaxing as their attempt to establish themselves with the aire of the friendly European bier gardens was a great idea which Julian seems to have executed quite well!  The \"garage door\" windows around the building, allow for a nice open, yet comfort-savy atmosphere; similar to a nice \"gathering of friends\" feel even if you don't live in the neighborhood.  Much to my delight it was more of an adult, relaxed and enjoying great beer, type of atmosphere rather than being over run by partying coed's  The food menu is limited right now, but they have just opened recently, so I am sure more good things will come as they adjust to their \"re planned kitchen\" size. (Sadly the DOH or other municipal entity apparently kiboshed their plans of an outdoor grill. Shame on them!).  Regardless the small kitchen, they seem to make quite good use of many nice local products.  The sausages that we tried were wonderful, as well as their fries and many deelishis dipping sauces.  But my ultimate favorite... The amazing pretzel braids!!  Wonderful fresh baked greatness that melts in your mouth! They have a fantastic array of beers, (and wine, and cocktails) served in nice glassware with fresh carafe of ice water that is frequently refilled, (something I VERY MUCH appreciated on a very hot day!).   The decor was very nice, very comfortable, with reclaimed woods, etc.  Many nice little details that I really noticed, and very much appreciated.   The staff was plentiful and absolutely wonderful.  I simply couldn't ask for more.  I could have easily spent all afternoon and evening there.  I had considered taking the light rail from the East valley simply because I don't like to have to fight to find parking, but I drove there instead and found plenty of parking in the 7th street \"brick house\" building which you can enter from 6th.   I will be back often!  I LOVED the food, drink, people, and atmosphere!  We plan on also making this a \"Once a Month Green Sustainability Meetings\" place as well. (GS meetings being an inside joke for coworkers) My only dislike, (and a minor one at that) was the patron's hand washing sinks and mirrors between the men's and women's restrooms.  Although spotless and well appointed, they are \"shared\". There is no mirror/sink area privately in the Ladies room.  I prefer to wash my hands, fix my hair, reapply lipstick, or adjust my clothing in private, rather than with the male patrons and/or a slightly viewable area to the dining room. Do yourself a favor and be sure to try this new establishment in downtown Tempe on Mill.  It is a \"Multifaceted Gem\" for sure.  Thanx Julian!",

The beer selection is satisfying, the layout of the bar is great (with both indoor and outdoor options), and the staff are generally very friendly and helpful. Yes, the beer is overpriced (a pint is not a pint here, I'm afraid), but I tend to overlook that. There is one thing, however, that is quite impossible to overlook.  TURN DOWN THE MUSIC.  Not just a little bit. Down by half, please.  It is simply not possible to have a conversation without getting hoarse. Last night I brought a decently large group here. We spent around $150 in a fairly short period of time, and would have spent another $150 IF WE COULD HAVE CARRIED ON A CONVERSATION WITHOUT SHOUTING. We asked various members of staff repeatedly if they could please turn down the music, and we got the same (very sympathetic) response every time: \"we all agree that the music is way too loud, but the owner keeps coming in and cranking up the volume.\"  So we left, walked down to Tops, and spent our $150 there.  Some people have tried to apologize for the stultifying volume of the music at this place by pointing out that the bar is catering to a college-age crowd. WE were both (a) COLLEGE-AGE and (b) a CROWD, and the volume of your music drove us and our money right out the door.  Owner-Person: you are patently nuts. We understand. But you would do well to listen to your customers, and your very friendly staff. In fact, you should listen very attentively to your staff, since they're the ones that will soon be filing claims with OSHA concerning their hearing-loss.",

They had plenty of televisions for sports watching and bench seating for larger groups.  The patio was a great addition, for smoking or possibly hanging out when the weather is nice.  We stopped in because another bar was fully packed and we saw another group was going into Handlebar and commenting on the display in the window.  There was so type of indecent doll doing something to a handlebar.  Sounds like the perfect place to me.   My husband and I were waiting to go to dinner later so we only ordered drinks.  Our waiter was pretty attentive at first but the more people that came in that he knew the less we saw of him.  I ordered a Moscow mule that had whiskey but wasn't strong so I could have kept with the pitcher of water on the table.  My husband ordered some drink with beer and vodka, I believe but as you can see, it was so forgettable I can't even remember what it was.  Pretty much we had a pit stop to warm up and figure out our next course of action.  Walgreens would have been a better option.",

Since we are normally at the bar the service is usually quick and they keep an eye on us.   The last time I came was for a birthday party. It was one of those few chilly nights in Tempe and they had warned us we might be outside, but they had heaters. Turned out they were able to reserve a few tables inside, so that was a nice surprise. They assigned 1 main server to us, but also had 2 others with knowledge of the group and they did a wonderful job.   I have only ever tried the fries and they were good, but I can't comment on the other food. Will have to give it a whirl sometime. This is a nice option for graduates or a working professional as it doesn't get overrun with young students.",

The place is really loud especially if you sit inside. Practically no food though, just burger, sausages and fries? I get that its a grill, but seriously, absolutely nothing for vegetarians?. I ordered a side order of sauerkraut for lack of options, and was the worst one I had tasted ever! And oh the big guys acting as cleaners just try to take Ur food away while u r still eating!",

If you're in a bit of a rush, let the server know so they can help accordingly since they tend to let you be in peace which is nice most of the time.  The beer list is quite extensive and includes \"beer cocktails\" which is something I haven't run into much.  The shandy is very tasty; would be great to day drink to on a weekend.  Food is quality, a little expensive (hamburgers don't include fries).  Fun atmosphere.  We were there for trivia night which we weren't aware of but the questions seemed fun and unique to the establishment.  DOG FRIENDLY!  Patio has separate entrances and the server brought our pooch out a bowl of water first thing.  Would definitely come again.",

There wasn't really a line, although there were a lot of people inside.  There wasn't a cover for guys/girls.  The music was alright.  Sounded like a mixture of everything along with top 40s.  We found a free table in back and hung out there the whole night.  I drank 2 AMFs and didn't feel much of a buzz...or maybe I did later but didn't realize it lol  It was a good night.  We even had some entertainment going on with some drunk people trying to jump the rail by our table.  I guess the lady was too drunk to realize that she can get in if she could just act normally.  Too bad security came by and made them leave.  For the rest of the night, the guys were trying to pick up on some girls, but I guess they see me and think I'm cock-blocking or something.  Some girls actually had made eye contact with them but they didn't do anything -_-  No game hahaha",

    "text": "I was really excited to finally go to Handlebar.   I love beer, I love bicycles and I like bar food!    We went tonight; a hot, humid summer monsoon evening.  They keep all the doors and windows open but as nice as that sounds, that means that it will also be hot and humid inside.  I grew up in Arizona, and run long distances so I'm used to heat.  I was wet with sweat after about 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, I order my $6.50 beer and sadly discover they pour 12 oz draft beers, not pints like ummm, pretty much every other place there is.    So, for prices that are about 33% too high, you get 3/4 of a beer.  I wasn't going to do that again so I switch gears.   It's Tito's Vodka night.  There's a rep from Tito's giving samples. She mentions that Tito's Vodka drinks are $4.    Which ones? \"All drinks with Tito's vodka\", she says.  \"Cool, we'll order some\" I say.  She is so proud of me, she gives me a T-shirt.   Our waitress comes by, and asks for our 2nd round order.   \"We'll have some of the $4 Tito's drinks\".  We ask which ones are on special.  She too says \"All drinks with Tito's Vodka are $4\"   She's nice and we chit chat and discuss the drinks shown on the Tito's placard on the table. We ask for suggestions, she motions to the placard and says \"All of those are really good,  especially for $4\"  I order a \" vodka sonic\" (soda/tonic) , my wife gets the vodka martini (which the waitress, the table placard, and the Tito's Vodka rep all said was $4)  We get the bill.  My drink was $4 and the ,martini was $6.    We ask about the discrepancy.    She says \"Yes, the Vodka part of the martini was $4 but the rest of it was $2 more\"    \"What do you mean 'The rest of it was $2', You told us at least three times the Tito's drinks were $4\"  \"RIGHT HERE (on the table) it says 'Tito's vodka martini; $4'\"  \"Yes, the vodka part is $4 but the martini part was $2 extra.  That totals $6\"  Then why did you, and the Tito's person say it was $4?  \"WELL, everyone knows a martini is extra\"  I guess olives are $1 each.  P.S. The place kind of smelled like pee.  :)",

This place looked like a good fit for a pub/cocktail scene so we dropped in for a few. The wait staff wasn't overly friendly or fast and the drinks were a little steep for the pour provided but so it goes. The inside was chill and relaxed and the food was likely good from what I saw. They also had a slew of board games to sit and play if you're into that sort of thing. The beer list wasn't huge but it was interesting and they had decent bourbon on hand. Lastly, the patio looked pretty inviting from the quick look I had while trying to find our elusive server. It's worth a looksee.",

We had the soft pretzel appetizer and shared a small order of fries. Everything was amazing. Nothing outdid something else...I can't pick a favorite.   Four stars instead of five because of the wait staff. You should never have to even ask for a drink refill at 2pm in a bar on a Monday, let alone wait 10 minutes to even get the chance to ask while another server walks by your table also and doesn't even look over. Otherwise our experience was great and we will likely be back.",

The atmosphere is rustic, chill and enjoyable. The staff is very knowledgable and friendly and there are plenty of tvs and seats to enjoy a game.   Now let's talk beer. They have a rotating beer menu which allows you to try different beers on tap every visit. During my visit, I had a delicious white chocolate ale. It tasted like beer with a chocolate after taste! I don't know if I could have had more than one, but it was still was tasty. While looking through the menu, we noticed that they serve beer cocktails which intrigued me so I had to give one a try! I'm glad I did because their beer cocktails are amazing! They also serve pims cups in copper mugs.   While there, I noticed that they have great happy hour pricing daily from 3-6:30 ($3 off beer, well drinks and wine) and considering that the beers are only around $5 to begin with, the happy hour pricing is a smokin' deal! I also appreciated the purse hooks they have at the bars.   Finally, the food. They have a small but mighty menu consisiting of pretzels, sausages and burgers. We had the pretzels with beer cheese. Yum!! The beer cheese is amazing and the pretzels were fresh from the oven. Next time we'll stay for a burger and more beer.",

Sure it's a busy Saturday, but my brother ordered a Delirium, and sure the keg was tapped, but it took 10 minutes for the girl to come back and say \"we're working on it.\" 2. Overly obnoxious and overly intoxicated students - don't get me wrong, I've been there myself. But these kids were so loaded, I would have seen them get kicked out of any reasonable bar. Honestly, surprised there wasn't a fight!! 3. Bathroom's weren't incredibly clean. Not bad enough to scare me away, just not up to par.

    "text": "So the wife and I are taking a little Staycation in Tempe this weekend and decide to hit Mill Ave on a Saturday night. THIS is a first for me, being in my 40's. I've never had the desire to hang out in College town on a weekend night. We LOVED the Handlebar, it was one of the least obnoxious bars on Mill.  Sorry bass pumping techno music or hip hop doesn't do it for me.  We laughed and gave the doorman shit when he asked for our ID's........REALLY? We're the oldest ones in here!!!  We gladly gave him our ID's and must of caught the attention of the manager on duty, before we got our first drink, shots were sent over! YEAH!!  Bar staff was great all night, great selection of beer, we didn't order any food, we didn't want to ruin our buzz. We liked it so much, we came back and started Sunday Funday here!  The only thing I can say bad about this place is the Lilith fair, depressing music on Sunday, it was a 180 from Saturday night.",

They're even kind enough to get their fire pit going every time I ask for it!  They also serve the white chocolate ale (which I'm a fan of!)  As for the music, it's a hit and miss. Sometimes you get some good jams, and there are times when it's been some weird instrumental techno. I prefer when they play more 90s music.. it keeps it different from the other bars on mill.

There isn't much going on at this time a day on Mill Ave. Definitely a bar atmosphere as soon as you walk in. Bartenders are chill, very attentive. Cool tshirts, too bad they don't have any for sale. Ordered a classic burger with fries, it was recommended by bartender as one of most popular items. Asked for it medium, got it medium well, but still good. The fries are really good, I got a Thai ketchup with it but you don't even need ketchup that's how good they are. The Thai ketchup is also really good. I got a, what I was told, localish beer....Kilt Lifter. Not bad at all. I'd recommend it, although more pricey than it should be for a burger that's not out of this world.",

The bartender was on top of stuff, even if he possibly was the only one that truly had his ducks in a row (why you feel the need to keep ducks in a row - I never understood).. but $5 fries with two sauces, out of one is a peppercorn ranch does but a dent in my diet, but is also a lifesaver if one feel well served by any place on might have patronized previous to this place.

I just don't want anyone spoiling my happy place. Please go to Firehouse or something...I beg of you.  Anyway - They have a perfectly planned, concise menu. Decide what you feel like and they will have the most fruity, dry, hoppy, chocolatey, malty (anything) draughts and/or bottles to fulfill your desires. White Chocolate Ale? Oh, they have it. A rare Belgian Framboise? Drink it up.  If you're hesitant about beer, but still not trainwrecky enough to hang out at the other Mill spots, you can get a \"beer cocktail\". Promise you can't go wrong here.  Lastly (but definitely not least)...there's the food - Comforting, simple, child-hood memory evoking, local deliciousness.   The patio is perfect, the food is divine, and the beer is everything you'd want on your wishlist.  I post this with hesitation. Don't ruin my joint!",

I find myself, more often than not, going to Handlebar because of their exceptional service, great beer menu, and because they're one of the only real bars that isn't just there for college students.   Recently, my girlfriend graduated college and we needed a venue to celebrate. Handlebar hooked us up! Mark and Geoff helped us out a great deal! Not only did they help us reserve the back patio area, but they also accommodated us (without hesitation) during one of the largest sporting days of the year (Kentucky Derby and the MayPac Fight). They both were very professional when presenting options for food, drink and even assigned our own private server. The party went off without a hitch, the food and drink kept coming as we needed it, they even refrigerated our cake! If you ever need to have a space for a small gathering, happy hour meet up, or just to hangout, I highly recommend Handlebar!  Also, big props to Geoff, Mark, and our server (sadly I forgot her name). Geoff is our favorite bartender and Mark is a fantastic owner!",

The menu is small but has lots of good pub grub on it, but I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a salad. My friends' food came out before mine and their sandwiches and burgers looked great - upscale toppings, cheeses, thick breads, nice presentation, etc. The french fries are yummy and come with great dipping sauces.  Then my salad was brought out. It was a salad you buy from Wendy's or other such fast food places, still in a disposable black bowl with the clear disposable top. The lettuce was dry, there were a couple of tomatoes, a few slices of cucumber, a sliced hard boiled egg, and that was it! The menu listed carrots, radishes, onion, and smoked cheddar as ingredients but none of that was on it. I mean, COME ON, put it on a real plate and give me all the ingredients or don't serve it at all.",

The atmosphere is a bit classy for the college scene in my personal opinion but maybe it will harness refinement in these young bucks HA!  The beer selection is pretty broad and has a pick for someone and anyone.  They've also got some fine.....spirits and liquers!  It's Mill and I was surprised with some of the selection which will make for a lovely blurry evening soon enough.  Another great note is the space of this place.  It's pretty open and airy which is awesome compared to the other places on Mill which are reminiscent to a college party basement.

She addressed my wife and I equally, which point of etiquette is frequently ignored by many servers, including women. She recommended the Weihenstephan hef for my spouse and the Bell's Two Hearted IPA for me.  I commented to her that some negative reviews had pointed out that burgers that were ordered  medium rare were frequently served well done. She made note and our burgers were perfect. The only 2 minor issues were that they do not serve real bacon, only bleu cheese bacon dressing and that the sweet potato fries with dips were good but limp, not crisp. The food menu is very limited, but Kayla's enthusiasm, knowledge of the offerings and very pleasing attitude made this a pleasant experience. We will be back!",

GET AWAY FROM THERE.  STEP BACK.  With the mood lighting and custom decor, the place seems to be trying to be swanky, but, even if their patrons are a group of well dressed mid-30 year olds, they're treated like cattle.  Really, who wants to be served drinks by a riot squad?  Ironically, this place is bicycle themed, and a local bicycle organization I'm involved in made it one of our stops on an organized ride.  We took about fifty people there, on bikes, after contacting the management and making arrangements.  The welcome was far from warm (\"GO AROUND!  YOU CAN'T COME IN THIS WAY!\"), but as we were staging our riders to leave, security basically flipped out on us, acting like they were ready to attack us, screaming at us, and running around like angry apes because we couldn't queue all of riders to leave instantly.  One guy screamed \"YOU AREN'T EVEN MOVING.  I TOLD YOU TO GET OFF OF OUR FENCE\".  We had three riders that had squeezed up next to the fence to allow a crowd to go by in front, and the other 30 odd that were ready were between the bushes on the other side of the sidewalk, to keep a clear path.  Bizarrely, bar security was being hostilely possessive of the sidewalk that wasn't even what they are leasing.  Our entire stop was 45 minutes.  There was no loitering.  I have a friend who works here and who I consider to be good with people.  If I were going to be biased, it would be in favor of the place.  All of the riders moved as soon as the gaggle of people going down the sidewalk had passed.  We were a group of grown adults, but not even college students should be treated this way.  I'm old enough to remember when college students on Mill Avenue weren't.  Long Wongs, which required physical intervention on occasion, never conducted itself like this before its Mill Ave location was bulldozed.  Even Casey Moores is pretty good at being more level headed than their patrons rather than trying to out dickhead them.  \"Give me your money and do what we say\" never sat well with me.  There are way too many other places that are actually good -- better beer, better beer selection, better prices, and run not like a prison that I can go to.  If this gets suggested for rides in the future, I'm vetoing it.",

    "text": "This place was so disappointing. We tried to go with a group. They lost our reservation so we didn't get to sit outside, not a huge deal but not good. They offered a free round of shots to make up for it but they gave us no choice in shots so while this might have been something to help them recover, for all we knew we got sugar water. They didn't have to offer up the expensive stuff but some say in what we wanted would have made it better. Next, our service was terrible. After they moves us to a spot that was too small for our group (because remember they lost our reservation) it took almost 20 minutes to get a server at our table. Then the server was MIA all too often. On top of that, the food selection for a group was miserable. Granted, it's on us for not doing better research on what food options were available for a group but it was disappointing. The only easily shareable items on the menu were literally fries and pretzels. Sorry, we won't be back.",

    "text": "My friends and I came to Handlebars on a mellow bar crawl. Unfortunately someone wanted the table we were sitting at outside, three of us had gotten up to order drinks since the cocktail waiter was nowhere to be seen. The manager asked our four friends still sitting at the table to move in exchange for a free round. The rest of us sat down at the new table and after 40 minutes one of us finally asked if the manager could come back and help with the free round situation. He came back and said only four drinkers were covered for the first round (which most everyone had already payed for) and those same four people could have an additional free drink. Two stars because they ended up promising to comp 8 drinks total, but no one else ended up at the other table and our whole party (10 by the end of the night) had to squeeze into a much smaller table. One additional star because the fries were amazing. Minus a star for general weirdness and attitude, minus one star because I came during their Sunday posted hours last week and they were closed.",
