Nothing to write home about, but no need to avoid it if you happen to be hungry for Mexican food and are nearby.",

The taco was OK, but the relleno was basically a chile with a lump of cheese on top and grease was pouring out of the tamale.  My wife's fish taco was so dry it tasted like it was cooked 6 hours earlier.  The refried beans were dry and burst along with the rice.  My son said the chimi was good.  Not a good experience, will never go back.  We've been getting take out at Carolina's lately.  The food is simple and good.  It's quite a drive but well worth it.",

Luckily I had some wonderful company make up for this!  Chips and salsa were kind of generic...and the salsa was presented in these carafes...not overly appetizing, but that's just me. Usually I find myself going back to the chip basket, but I found it surprisingly easy to hold myself back before our entrees arrived.   I had the chicken fajitas. You know the best part of fajitas?  The sounds, smells and attention each sizzling skillet receives as it's carried out of the kitchen.   Sadly, mine had none of these attributes. A couple people in my party had this pleasure, but I did not. My only guess is my plate was sitting under a heat lamp as the first round of orders were carried out. Perhaps I should've ordered something else.   On the plus side, the guac was incredibly fresh, the tortillas were tender, and the rice was very good.",

Perhaps the staff gets ready when they arrive to work?   Anyhow, hair aside, I actually like the food here. The beans are delish, rice cooked well, chips crisp and salsa fresh.   I also have great service every time. I like the bar at this particular location, too. The bartenders have always been friendly and it's awesome for people watching while patrons wait outside the front doors for a table. (Take note: yes, we can see you from the bar, but it's hard to see in).   If they invested in hairnets this place would be a little more than \"a-okay\"!   So keep an eye out for strays and if you manage to get your food sans the extra protein, you will certainly enjoy this place!",

I always get the flauta dinner -chicken is better than beef, for sure- they are juicy and stuffed (no meat skimping here!) and well flavored. Beans and rice are pretty good too.  My biggest complaint would be in regards to the drink selection. Margaritas are plentiful and varied, but if you're not a tequila person (I'm not) you're pretty much  stuck with soda or beer. Eh. Wish they'd make mojitos or horchata or something.  Service is mediocre but usually not lacking, decor is a little random - don't come here if you want something \"classy;\" but with the right expectations and some fond memories, this place delivers.",

We have seen staff members come and go but they have maintained very good consistency with service and quality of food.  We have been to other Ajo Al's in the valley but this one is our favorite and it's close to home. We have experienced different service and even slightly different tasting food (good or bad) from each of them so please consider where you are eating.  My family teases me because I get the very same thing every time we go.  Ground beef burrito with rice and beans added inside the burrito with two sides of shredded cheese and one side of sour cream.  I cover the burrito in the mild salsa too. They say it should be a regular on the menu...\"Bill's Burrito\".  You have to try the Queso dip.  Hot, cheesy and very good!  My family assures me everything else is great!  Machacha Chimi and Pappa Jack enchiladas are very good according to them.  At this location, get there a little early on Friday and Saturday nights or there will be a short wait for a table.  Weeknights are okay anytime.  We take all our visiting, out of town friends to Ajo Al's to enjoy good Mexican food!",

One of the reasons that we like to come here is that over the years the service as well as the food quality have been well over average. And both service and food are consistent.  I have often praised the training given the staff. Today the food, like always, was delicious.  However the service left a lot to be desired. We started out sharing a cheese crisp.  Then my daughter had the Carne Asada tacos and I had my usual shredded beef chimichanga.  We shared a fried ice cream to top off our meal.  I also ordered my husband's two favorite things to take home for him.  Chili Relleno and a Carne Asada Burrito.   Our server, Chapo, may have been new. He seemed to be a little lost.  I asked for more napkins at least four times until finally at the end of our meal, I got up and took them from the glass in the center of another table. While trying to share our dessert we are reaching over all of the dirty plates because he did not clear any of our plates when he brought the dessert.  He brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. A cardinal sin in the service business. Anyway,  all in all a good meal I just want to give constructive criticism on how the service could be better. We will be back because it is a favorite of our family",

Bring it back and I will gladly rerate back to a 5*. #bringredchiliback #don'tfixwhatisntbroken) #ajoalsrocks",

I personally feel the place could be cleaner & would suggest staff sit in booths & look at walls around booth to see splatters on walls etc. I'm not a fan of the new menu artwork/readability.  Gone are the \"al a carte\" items. ???  When I asked the server about it she actually said \"we took them off because we can do everything al a carte\".  Well that works out just fabby if you don't care what $$ your paying for something. Sounds like an opportunity for the business to make $. I guess the Customer can ask each time the want something .. \"I'll have a taco, how much is that?\", add a side of sour cream... how much is that? Enchilada style would be good... how much extra?\"  Yeah.... that sounds like a load of embarrassing customer fun.",

Chips and salsa came quickly but the salsa was in a bottle but no bowl to put it in, I asked the server & he said people just use the plate and pointed to a little bread plate on the table. How are you suppose to dip your chips into a plate of salsa? He brought us some little to go containers to put our salsa in, turns out it didn't matter since the chips were out of a bag and not very good. I got a combo plate, my taco shell was just as dull and tasteless as the chips, the inside of the taco was fine. Tostada Was the same as the taco. My enchilada was good but but had so much sauce I couldn't even see the enchilada. Rice and beans were average. Overall with a few changes and some different chips and taco shells this could be a good place, but for now it's not worth a second trip.",

The enchiladas red sauce was very dark and very tasty, the taco was as good as a taco can be and I liked the green chili burrito however I would have rather had green chili pork instead of green chili beef.....Overall great experiance and good food.",

The Chicken Chimichanga and Pollo Con queso entrees (with their Mexican rice and refried beans) are very good, however my recommendation is the \"Mexican Pizza\" which is a fantastic and filling twelve inch \"pizza\" that could easily feed four people. The bottom crispy tortilla is topped with a large amount of shredded chicken, or ground beef, with diced jalapenos & tomatoes, guacamole, a second crispy tortilla smothered with a generous layer of Mexican-blend cheese and a sprinkling of sliced green onions. I usually cannot finish two slices; it is that filling. The restaurant itself is what you would expect if you wanted to dine at a Mexican restaurant. They have indoor and outdoor seating and a little five seat bar.",

They do not skimp on the tequila. I won't be back.",

Able to order a few things from the Happy Hour menu..cheese crisp, gold margarita and then ordered the guacamole, too. All of it was super tasty. Ordered the chicken flautas with the spiced cream cheese (slapped on salsa and guac too, of course), and it was ridiculous!  Our little waitress Tatiana was AWESOME..especially since she clued us into finding a Groupon for tonight's dinner. She handled all of us quite well...and I'll be honest, we're pretty high maintenance. So, definite props to her (and a very happy birthday!)  This is still a terrific place, with yummy food, and great service... Do yourselves a favor, and get in there. :)",

I can't say enough about the service. The staff is so nice and as a regular they remember what we like to get even if we haven't been in in awhile. There is almost never a wait unless you are going Friday or Saturday evening, and even then the wait time in minimal.  One thing to keep in mind when ordering is that a few of their appetizers are quite large and should be split among large groups ( nachos or any of their Mexican pizzas). My personal favorite though is the Chili con Queso dip. Another ordering tip is that they will bring you regular salsa with your chips but they actually have spicier ones if you ask your server.   I could go on and on about what I like about each dish but you just need to go there and try them for yourself.",

The salsa tastes like it comes straight from the can with no additional ingredients or any fresh tomatoes.  We've dined here several times and have tried many different dishes but none of them are up to scratch. One member of our family LOVES Ajo Al's and is a regular, so she always enjoys her meals here.",

It's always been a neighborhood staple to those who grew up in the area as it's conveniently located and the prices are really reasonable.  As I've grown older and taken more notice of things like quality of food and level of service, Ajo Al's has gone a bit down in how I'd rate the place. Don't get me wrong, every time I come I know exactly what I'm going to get, and so should you!  They overload you on chips and salsa which is awesome because I friggin' love chips and salsa, but beware of filling up too quickly. The service is always a bit lacking, sometimes slow, sometimes not the friendliest. The margaritas are decent, but they never put enough ice in them when you order it on the rocks. The food itself is average, I usually like the combo plate with a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada or the fajitas with chicken and steak. Pollo Con Queso is the fan favorite here, I have friends who will swear by it every time they come.  Overall, it's a decent place to get Mexican food where the food is consistent, service is so-so, and you wont have to break the bank on your bill.",

The portions are massive and the food is always good. It's nothing super special worth writing home about, but solid Mexican comfort food. I typically get a chimichanga, sometimes beef, sometimes chicken. It's always good. My fiance typically gets the floutas (spelling?), which are like taquitos. I've had enchilada here before and he's had fajitas. Always solid. The margaritas are hit or miss, I've had some that are really watery and some that were good. Usually I stick to iced tea at lunch because Pepsi just isn't my thing. The service is usually good, we used to get a rather sullen server at lunch, but haven't seen him in a long time. The last half dozen times we've been has been spot on. Good combination of both men and women servers which is nice to see. Also, I saw a review a few below mine that touched on Mercedes' service. I've had her a number of times and I've always found her to be really pleasant and friendly, so I was kind of shocked to see that. I don't usually comment on servers individually in Yelp reviews because I've been a server so I understand that it can really hurt that person if something bad is said about them. So, I just wanted to throw that in there.",

She was nice and friendly and knew the menu like the back of her hand.  I wish all servers could have the same cheerful friendly attitude everywhere!  Will be asking for her the next time I stop in! Fantastic!",

When I'm looking for a healthier option though it's the salad carbon with steak for me and with chicken for my hubs. They also have a great happy hour and Mondays are all day happy hour. Bring on the frozen margaritas and queso!  Cheers!!  Service has always been great too. There's one particular server named Alissa who has never let me down in the years I've been going there. She's super friendly and attentive, not to mention her makeup is always on point!",

    "text": "I used to go to the two Ajo Al's locations in north Scottsdale every now and then several years ago, and I always liked them. A friend of mine was in town for work recently and wanted Mexican food. He was staying near this location so I suggested it.   It's been a LONG time since I had been to an Ajo Al's, but this location seems bigger. It was crowded when we came, but we were able to get a table pretty quickly.   The menu is pretty much how I remember it. I wasn't completely starving when I came, so I didn't get any queso dip, but I used to be OBSESSED with it and I hope it's the same. When I say I used to come here every now and then with friends often times we came specifically for that dip. The chips and salsa that they serve here is good. I like runnier salsa, which is what they serve at Ajo Al's, and I like to mix with just a touch of the spicy salsa to give the mild just enough of a kick.   For my meal I got one of the combo platters...a chicken burrito in green sauce with beans and rice. The portions here are HUGE and the chicken was cooked well. The beans and rice were pretty standard, but are good if you add some salsa.   Our waitress was attentive and nice. One thing I noticed about this location is that is can get LOUD.  Prices are fair (especially considering the portions). I've never understood \"fancy\" Mexican places, and if I'm not going to a little take-out place I prefer a casual restaurant like Ajo Al's for Mexican food.",

Bus boy drops off chips and salsa, no water. To salty and spicey to not have water. After sitting for pretty long a waitress asked if we were taken care of. We said no and she took a drink order and asked for water. Water came right away. A while later a waiter shows up and asks if we would like a drink. Told him a young lady took a drink order but we were ready to order food. We ordered waited some more, a lot more when we saw the waitress.  I asked where my margarita was? Her response, \" oh he didnt bring it?\" Off she went and I could see her talking to our waiter. No doubt about our drink order that one of them dropped the ball on. Finally the margarita arrives. Two minutes later the food arrives. It was average at best. I live just 4 blocks away and will drive past to go elsewhere.  Oh, that margarita, water with lime flavor.",

Just went there for a late lunch, and the place was filthy, service was terrible and food was just oily and flavorless. On top of that, my daughter found some identifiable objects in her meal, utensils were cruddy and one of the chip plates had very obvious crust on it. The women's room was incredibly dirty, dingy and the entire restaurant is looking just plain rundown and neglected. The booth we were in was detached from the wall and separated from the base, so you could see years of grunge and misc objects that had piled up through the years. The lights were burned out around our table, which made it even seedier feeling, Lunch at 230pm on a Saturday, so the place was fairly empty, yet it took 30 minutes to get a cheese crisp, some rice and 2 salads (not the kind ordered), then another 5-10 minutes to get the 2 salads we actually ordered (which were so greasy they were basically inedible).from the moment we got there, there dirty tables all around us, and I even cleared some dirty dishes from our table and put them on a nearby dirty table (as servers and other staff watched), yet they just walked by the piles of gross dishes over and over. So bizarre. I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like. BLECH. I will never ever ever go to this place again.",

I have eaten at this location many times over the better part of the past decade, and unfortunately I believe that the quality of the food has been in a gradual decline.  When I started coming here the portions were huge and the quality was consistently good.  More recently the portions have been smaller and the dishes have been less consistent.  In particular, I am a creature of habit so I usually get the chicken enchiladas.  Previously, the chicken enchiladas would have been dominating the plate with their overwhelming size and juicy meat.  More recently the chicken has been dry and the plate has been taken over by the rice and beans.      The AYCE chips and salsa are a nice touch, but I would prefer paying a little bit more for slightly larger portions and better-cooked food than getting copious portions of chips.",

Not quite sure what has happened maybe their chef got deported?? Food is not the same!!! Bring your real chef back PLEASE!! Also the menu prices have gone up and up and up. Worse food higher cost Not a recipe for success",

I have to say that Ajo Al's version is one of the best out there.  I usually get the Beef Flautas with the cream cheese and a side of beans.  It is even tastier to mix some of the cream cheese with the beans!  The pollo fundido is also excellent, of course, it too has the cream cheese!  They do a good job on the classics as well, enchiladas, tacos and I love their salsa too!  Overall, a quality place serving Sonoran style favorites.",

    "text": "I wrote a semi-scathing review of the Ajo Al's on 16th street, but I want to make clear that this particular store is considerably better than its Phoenician counterpart.   I'm not sure exactly what it is that makes this experience so much better, but I think it's a blend of the ambiance and the food. First off, the decor is much nicer, and the art more tasteful, and the food is just plain better. Don't get me wrong, it still doesn't make my top ten mexican food spots in Phoenix, but it isn't bad for Tex-Mex.  Great for gringos looking for some satisfying grub, without wanting to burn anything or overwhelm the taste buds.",

    "text": "We have been going to Ajo Al's for 10 years. We have always been satisfied with the food, but not today. I usually order either a chicken tostada or a chicken and bean tostada or a bean tostada. Today, I ordered the bean tostado and it was smaller than its ever been. I didn't say anything, but more than likely wouldn't order it again. It seems to be a trend with restaurants right now to reduce their serving sizes. Well, guess what, I won't be frequenting the ones who do. We ordered two cadillac margaritas at $8 apiece. You would think the least we could have expected would have been decent size portions of food. Our total bill was $39 plus tip. No way, Jose. So, if you're looking for an appetizer, the bean tostada is a good choice. If you're looking for a lunch size portion, the bean tostada is not it. Hey, Al, feel free to comment.",

Then came the chili con queso.  What a let down.  It didn't even taste like real cheese.  It tasted like cheap pre-made \"pseudo cheese mix\".  Yucky.  Very watery.  Then came the bean dip.  It tasted neither good nor fresh.  2.5-3.0 stars.  The 4 mini beef chimis were about a 2.5-3.0 stars as well.  The beef taco I would give 3.0 stars.  Overall, the food here is a grade below Taco Bell.  Cheap fast food for cheap prices.  Bill before tax and tip was 16.00.    Did something happen? This place used to be really good at one point.",

Tonight was a great surprise as we got mango margaritas before our meal. Refreshing, and delicious.  We eat here all the time and have never ever been disappointed.  Fantastic menu and bring the kids.  Great kid menu and unlike many restaurants they do offer a burger and fries for the kids and lots of other great things on the kids menu.  It's so hard to recommend anything in particular because everything I've ever had here has been spectacular. The servers are always welcome amazing, friendly, and give great service. Seriously, you will not be disappointed. The food here is addictive.  UPDATE 10/24  I ordered from Grubhub and they brought the wrong food. GrubHub was not helpful at all so I called the restaurant and explained that I got the wrong item and the other item was freezing cold. Rebecca, the manager, she said I'm going to send you a brand new order and make sure everything is OK. She was so nice.   GrubHub said I had to order the item again and that's all they could do except credit me for the wrong item....,but when I spoke to rebecca and told her the other item was so cold she said oh I'm going to put a brand new one in don't even worry about it. She was great.  Ajo Al's Is first class. She could've just sent over the one item but to send the full order was True customer service. So this restaurant is fantastic not just for the food but the customer service, if you haven't been in or ordered from them you should it is Delicious food. Also, I recommend going with door Dash",

I ordered a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yep..water poured out of this burrito. I was like WTF?  I regretly tried a bite and it was dry flavorless and the little flavor it did have tasted like fish!!!   The water must have been from it being premade and frozen, Or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days.  The chips were stale and thick gross had a strange flavor. The salsa was so gross it was unedible.   What is wrong with you people, did you drop acid before you ate here?",

Several of my co-workers raved about the restaurant but honestly I think there are more positive memories of the fun times had at the restaurant than the actual food.   The menu had the regular American Mexican fare. A decent priced lunch menu. Though the descriptions of the food were lacking.   I ordered a chicken chimi it came with rice and refried beans.   The waitress brings out the food and my chimi is DRENCHED in this redish brown sauce. I taste it: some smokey, tomatoey, pasty sauce.  My co-worker informs me its Ranchero. Its also inescapable.  The rice instant, the beans, blech. The Chicken in the chimi 50% chance of getting a moist piece. The food was just lacking overall. I was hungry so I ate half of it. My co-workers really enjoyed their entrees So maybe its just me.   I am far from blown away by Ajo Als. I don't see myself returning to this restaurant.",

Chips were good and were replenished throughout. Salsa was tasty. Drinks were kept filled.  As far as the food, it came out quickly, was hot and tasted good. Our table did 3 orders of pollo fundido (me included) and a shredded beef chimichanga. Nothing crazy but no complaints from anybody at the table. Though we did the poco lunch size, all of us had enough for another snack. Beans & rice were nice enough as well.  In some of the more chain-type spots, I find myself skipping on the rice & beans once I try them.  Wasn't the case here. They were good and I would have cleaned my plate if I didn't find myself ridiculously full about 2/3 of the way in.  While I won't seek out Ajo Al's, I definitely won't cringe as I sometimes do when work colleagues lead me to chains. I guess it is a local chain with only 4 locations after all.  No complaints.",

    "text": "Solid restaurant. A gringo wonderland. I have lost my license and needed a dinner spot close enough to my hotel that I wouldn't run the risk of getting pulled over (i'm a hysterical driver...watch out Phoenix) and Ajo Al's reviews were pretty decent so I headed down to get some fish tacos.   I was scared about anything saying \"Del Mar\" after my Frank & Lupe's experience but though the Hawaiian Ono in the Tacos del mar ($11.95) was previously frozen, it was an enjoyable experience. I've never had Ono and to me the texture was like that of swordfish, which is just fine for a tiny soft taco. It was a little chewy, but again that's because it's frozen. The beans and rice were okay, and there was some sauce for the tacos that was okay too...not exciting enough for me to remember what the sauce was though, or what it tasted like.   When seated you will be presented with the world's largest basket of ultra thin tortilla chips you've ever seen, whether you are one person or 6. They were a little greasier than i prefer BUT they were warm and that makes them yummier.   I don't think I would go back here but I don't regret trying it. It was a good meal and the servers are very friendly and welcoming.",

    "text": "Solid food and a cozy atmosphere.   I love Mexican food, but can't stand how it typically comes in only two styles. Dirty and cheap. Or fancy and way overpriced. Ajo's Al's is that much needed middle ground. Delivering some quality food, but doesn't try to be upscale.   We went on Saturday night at 7:30. The place was pretty busy, but we were still seated right away and water and chips and Salsa were on the table just seconds later (which was great because I was starving). The waitress was really friendly, and she did something I really appreciate. When I ordered the Relleno Chicken Dinner, she warned me that it was covered in a very spicy sauce. I happen to love spicy food, but warning customers about something that's not written on the menu is what a good server should do.   The Relleno was excellent. It was wonderful to have a chicken and cheese stuffed pepper that wasn't deep fried. And she wasn't kidding about the sauce! With Rice and Beans, and the chips and salsa, I was more than set for the night. My girlfriend tried the Ono Fajitas. I applaud the effort of trying to cook a fish fajita, but it didn't work out so well. The fish was a little over cooked, and it's probably a result of sitting in the skillet. It wasn't too bad, but I tried a piece and wouldn't recommend it.   The restaurant itself is very casual. It's pretty much on par with the set up of any Mexican family restaurant chain. I really enjoyed dining here on a random Saturday night.",

I love those fried chicken chimichangas with the spicy cream cheese sauce on them (pollo fundido I believe they are called) and I love pizza. This is basically pollo fundido on top of pizza. Sooooooo good, and gigantic. We had left overs, which tasted a-may-zing cold. The chips and salsa are delish too, and they aren't afraid to refill them for you, which is good for me because I like to spoil my din din by going to town on freebies.  The service here is also good. The servers are nice and attentive. And a big plus for me is that it is CLEAN. I cant even count how many times I have had Mexican food in a filthy restaurant. Now, don't get me wrong, I love hole in the wall places, but in a sit down place that charges normal, not hole in the wall prices, I don't want to swat at fruit flies while eating my pollo fundido. I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but I will definitely go back.",

They seemed quite shortstaffed, but after asking the \"manager\" he said they were not at all short staffed and offered no apology for the delay in my food, the poor service, or the apparently typical ritual of bringing the bill out prior to any food... I can only assume this is because otherwise everyone would walk out rather than staying to wait for their food, but once you've pre-paid it seems obligatory to wait. On top of it, no monetary or service compensation was offered - I've recieved better service from hole-in-the-wall places. Overall, this was my second eerily similar bad experience, from a formerly frequent lunch place, and I will not be returning.",

I brought the pitcher to our waitress, who was quite surprised, and apologized. She brought us another pitcher and let us know that the receipt was from last week. When she brought us our check after our meal, we fully expected the margaritas to be comped or discounted. Nope. We told the server to go ask her manager to do better. She came back with a story that they can't discount/comp liquor, but they would put our name in their \"book\", and we'd be able to collect a complimentary appetizer next time. There will never be a next time for us.",

The cheese crisp is also on happy hour, and it is huge! The salsa at AA is really good. I think the only reason I would not give AA 5 stars is bc I've never loved their chips.

When you are seated they bring a tray of chips and salsa which is great and I always save some to eat with the beans that come with the entree!  Overall, this place is a staple in our house and a solid choice every time.",

My only complaint is they serve Pepsi and not coke.   Love their chicken. Best chicken tacos and anything with the shredded chicken you can't go wrong. Love the rellenos and awesome green corn tamale. Also best fajitas I have had in a long time.   Service has been outstanding all three times I have gone. I'm confused why the score is low. Don't let the three star rating deter you. I'm very picky and I love this place",

Portions are very large enough to split most dishes. Staff is friendly outgoing and there to serve. The chips are always fresh and hot and have different options for salsas. If you're looking for classic Sonoran Mexican food definitely check out one of their locations. They are also very reasonably priced and do an overall good job.",

We got to our table, we received 2 bowls of chips, all chips were tiny tiny, ya know the chips at the bottom of the bag. Looked like they didn't want to cook fresh chips so they served the crumbs that they had. Nevertheless, chips are chips so we still ate them. I ordered the cheese conqueso dip and when the server delivered it was very thin, almost a liquid consistency. I didn't want to say anything but my mom did and the waiter brought us shredded cheese that we added to the conqueso and made it right, ourselves (aren't we paying someone to do this for us?)  Anyway, besides everything that happened BEFORE getting our lunch, lunch was fabulous. Like always, their food is great. Maybe an off night?

Last time I went it was late, there were 2 other tables there and our server took his sweet time showing up to take say hi, take our drink order, forget about asking for extra chips, refills, etc as he was nowhere to be seen. I understand the servers have close out duties at the end of the night but maybe they could have had the hostess help out instead of her yapping to 3 girlfriends the whole time we were there.",

    "text": "Stopped by Ajo Al's with family while visiting them in Scottsdale.  Convenient location right off the 101 freeway.  Small parking lot.  Seating was prompt at dinner time and we had a great server who really stayed on top of things.  Atmosphere was casual, but a little dated and the main room was a bit noisy.  We did enjoy the various masks and southwestern appointments around the room.  Food was \"par for the course\"...  very average and essentially what you get from most other Mexican food restaurants throughout the valley.  Margaritas tasted nice and fresh.  Jalapeno Bean Dip was like a bowl of melted cheese with beans thrown in for color, but still tasted \"ok\".  Only complaint would be that my \"Chimichanga\", which is essentially a deep-fried burrito, came out way undercooked and the tortilla was exceptionally doughy.  Apart from that, the rest of the food was spot-on, the portions were big and Ajo Al's proved to be a good, although very average Mexican food joint.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  If you're in the area, give it a try!",

The waiter(?) also didn't greet us as he plopped a pitcher of water and some tortilla chips and salsa on our table. Guess we will pour it ourselves. More waiting. And THEN I discovered a HAIR in my mouthful of chips and salsa. APPALLING. Perhaps if we had encountered a single person on the way out, we wouldn't have told the groups waiting that they shouldn't waste their time. One of the worst \"dining\" experiences I've ever had.

Every time I come back to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I make it part of my ritual to find the closest Aho Al's to partake of their delicious cuisine.  Is it authentic Mexican food?  Probably not.  But my wife grew up in southern Colorado and she swears the green chili relleno here is as good as it gets.  Even though we have a fairly decent sized Hispanic population in the Kansas City area, so far none of the so-called Mexican restaurants that we have tried have measured up.  I normally get a chicken chimichanga, but this time I opted for seafood enchiladas with shrimp.   I was not disappointed.  For my wife, the green chili relleno - and on this trip, no heart-burn after the fact.  She loved it, as always.  One thing that can often be overlooked and understated are the free corn tortilla chips they serve you after you are seated at your table.  Their salsa is okay, but their tortilla chips are the best restaurant chips I have ever had, period.  I have to watch myself so as not to ruin my appetite by gorging on the chips before my meal arrives.    Service was great, as usual.  Prices are reasonable.  Overall, this trip, as all the others, was excellent.  Needless to say, next time we come to the area, we'll be checking out Aho Al's again, whatever the location.",

I usually start by talking about the food but holy cow, my server and service was hands down he best I have ever had and deserves notice first and foremost.    I never asked her for her name but got the bill later and it said my server's name was Mercedes so I hope this is the right name.  This girl put a smile on every table I watched her go to every single time including mine.  She was always at each table, at exactly the right time, with what the customer wanted.  Her consolidation skills were off the hook amazing and what I would expect from a high end steakhouse restaurant, not a neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  But the most important thing that stood out was that I felt she loved working there and was happy with her surroundings which usually comes from great management and ownership.   Mercedes was outstanding!    I experience here began even before I met my service.  I'm talking about the hostess that sat me!    When I arrived this place was really busy!  I was a single and the bar was full so I told the hostess and she immediately said \"that's ok, we can seat you and sat me at a 4 top during peak hours and no other tables available that I could see!    Menu was what I expected from classic Mexican food.  My staple Mexican dish is the pollo queso or pollo fundido as other places would call it.  #1 thing to look for on a good Mexican restaurant is this dish and all other dishes can be based off of this.  I also ordered my #2 dish, a cheese enchilada a la carte, which is normally what I have to get because my #1 is not on the menu.  Both were good but the up sell and service delivered made me go even further and get dessert as well.  Fried ice cream!  Also great.  I could barely walk out of here I was so full.  Kept thinking this was such a great experience I wanted to order more but just couldn't do it!    Great job guys!  Mercedes, you were awesome!",

    "text": "I'm a fan. Their margaritas are fantastic! So many to choose from........not enough days in the week. This time, the chips were a bit less than fresh and super thick. I like mine a bit thinner and fresher and saltier. The portions are huge! You must get the bean dip and that easily can be dinner for 2, but we always order 2 entrees anyway. Delicious for breakfast the next day! The one I go to is near Scottsdale and Shea. It's always crowded and it is because the food is good. Everything I've had is good, Mexican pizzas, enchiladas, flautas, tacos, salads, soups.",

Also can't forget about the Horchata drink and the fried ice cream. Overall, would totally recommend this lovely family-owned restaurant.",

I ordered a chicken chimichanga and there were literally chunks of aluminum foil INSIDE that were noticed on the first piece that was cut off. Sent the food back and more food came back luke warm and the plate was unbearably hot. Won't be back. Would rather eat at Taco Bell....",

The prices also haven't increased much over that time, so it's still a great neighborhood mexican restaurant. Been coming here for almost 20 years though, I remember back when they had a smoking section.   Food and service is still great. Pro tip, they have a hot salsa that they don't bring out by default, but if you ask for it, they will bring you some. Try it, I like cutting it 50/50 with their mild salsa.",

    "text": "Ajo Al's is the benchmark for us, that all other Mexican Food establishments are measured.  We have been regular customers since their inception at 90th street; and since being transferred out of state, every return to the valley includes a dining experience at Ajo Al's.  I think the notable differences for us, is the quality of white chicken they use in their dishes; it's not canned, nor mixed with dark meat.  The shredded beef tacos are superb, and guess what, cheese crisps are pretty much unknown beyond the state of Arizona!  So if you are a first time guest, you can expect more of a Tex/Mex flavor, and would recommend a combo plate letter F, or anything with Chicken!",

Enchilada not good so that's three different meals the different people having a bad experience. Also my red sauce on the chimichanga was more like Mole sauce. Just a plain bad dinner experience. I hardly ever write reviews but I had to on this one I love Mexican food but I couldn't even finish my meal nothing positive about this experience should get my money back. Sorry Ajo Al's",

We arrived here a little before 7PM, did our time and waited for about 20mins to be seated. I expected that, but it's a little under an hour and we still have not gotten our food. Meanwhile two other table that have been seated after us received theirs. My wife was kind enough and asked someone what the hold up was and they said it would be right out. Fast forward another 15 minutes and...Still no food. Have to say after being a Custer for a more than a decade I would not recommend this place if you have a family with young kids or if you plans that are there me sensitive.",

    "text": "I do wonder if there are just so many Mexican restaurants in the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale metropolitan area that people get very discriminating if they are local.  In that, a place that to an out of towner like me would seem really good is critiqued more harshly by the locals.    My take on this place after a friend brought me here is that the tacos are wonderful, the chips and salsa they give you are pretty good (I've had better chips out there), the Albondigas soup is something I don't get too often back home and I loved it, and that fried ice cream is to die for.    Solid 4 stars in my book.  But I'm from Philly.  To me this place is great Mexican.  You locals may be more picky than I am.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch with a friend and the food was decent.   They basically have two vegetarian items on the menu that aren't salads: guacamole tacos and garden fajitas. I wish they had something like a grilled veggies burrito or something to that effect.  I ordered the guacamole tacos and they were just ok. The guacamole didn't taste like it was made in house...sorta tasted like a mix. I guess it's personal preference but I like guacamole to taste fresh and like avocado. This tasted like garlic and had a weird consistency. The tacos came with a side of beans and rice, which were REALLY good.   The chips they give you tasted like they were from a bag and also not made in house.   Next time I think I'll try one of their salads.",

I like the spicy green salsa, but the spicy red is also tasty. I ordered the poco pollo con queso lunch special. It is fabulous and not diet friendly, but since I think dieting is stupid (albeit an occasional necessary evil), I was fine with it. It is stuffed with flavorful, shredded white meat chicken and has creamy cheesy sour cream layers on top, then served with a side of beans and rice. I also had a frozen toasted almond margarita. Don't let the name scare you, it is a delightful and delicious frosty amaretto-ish tasting concoction. The bar area is small and the service is friendly. I'll be back.",

You will feel sick after eating basic enchiladas here because of how much extra cheese and heavy sauce they put on them.  Their chicken burrito is HUGE and way too much for one person.

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this location with a group of friends.  The location was able to very quickly accommodate our group (~10) during lunchtime and the server for our table was friendly and attentive.  Since that first visit, I've been back with the family.  This review will include the experience for both visits.  I've struggled to find what I consider good Mexican fare here in the valley - probably not because of a lack of good places but because I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food and long for good ol' Tex Mex (can someone here please have carne GUISADA on their menu already?!).  The salsa was nice, but was a bit awkward with the carafe... Salsa is best eaten from a bowl type of vessel so you can get that chip and really get it in there.  It's just not the same scraping it off a plate, trying to get the last yummy bite.    I had the shrimp salad on my first visit, and the second time around, I went for the pollo con queso.  The shrimp was flavorful, but overcooked so it was tough.  They were friendly when accommodating my request for half an avocado on the salad instead of just one slice.  The dressing was delicious - reminiscent of Chuy's creamy jalapeno.  The pollo con queso was a delightful dish and a very large portion (enough for next day's lunch).  I requested a little side of that yummy dressing I remembered from the first visit and went a little crazy dipping bites of the chicken in it.    We'll definitely be going back to try more of the menu items and some of the house cocktails.",
