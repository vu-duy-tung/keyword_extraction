We had 7 in our group and all our food was brought out at different times. I got my main course, my wife didn't get her till almost 30 minutes later. My side dish didn't get to me until 20 minutes after my main course. We had two young kids with us and their food was the last one to get to our table. We ran out of napkins and I had to go to an empty table and get my own. It would of nice to have some sort of silverware to help my daughter break open her crap legs. Not sure if we'll go back anytime soon.",

They took over 40 minutes to bring our food out, but offered us free Cajun fries while we waited which was really nice of them. They kept checking on us and were extremely courteous. If there was a section to rate the service, they would get 5 stars for sure! The food though...that only gets 1 star. I always drink water when we go out and their water tasted awful like if it was from the ocean or the toilet or some place awful. Even adding lemons didn't help. I feel bad giving this place a 1 star review because they were so kind, but I really hated the food (and water). As soon as we walked in, I told my husband that it stunk in there like dirty fish and I wanted to go somewhere else to get a cheeseburger. I only ate a small piece of corn, 1 shrimp and a boat of Cajun fries. I was super sick. That food didn't agree with me at all. I hated how the shrimp eyes and legs were still attached. I could hardly even watch the other people around me eat. It was really disturbing - I don't eat meat very often anyways and when I do it's only chicken or a small cheeseburger. The food honestly freaked me out and I didn't touch the shrimp after that 1 bite. My husband's fingers stunk like fish even though he wore the gloves - Great way to ruin a great night out. I won't be back...EVER. It's whatever floats your boat I guess.",

My lips are still a little tingly as I write this and that isn't a bad thing.  I had crawfish and shrimp. The shrimp were huge! I got them both \"hot and juicy\" style and medium heat. I ordered Hot but the server was like \"are you sure? You've never been here before.\" On her recommendation I got the Medium and I am glad I did. I probably could have handled the hot but I wouldn't have enjoyed it. If it wouldn't have been totally inappropriate I would have slurped the juice off the table!  My hubs got the fried shrimp, also HUGE and battered in fish fry which was nice. He isn't much of a seafood eater but he even said he would like to go back. The beer selection isn't bad and the service was overly attentive if anything. Definitely quality. If you are delicate and don't want to get your hands dirty this isn't the place (they give you gloves but don't be that guy/girl) but I do recommend the bib.",

So we're waiting and waiting, and finally looking at how long it was been, 40 minutes already in.. People that got there AFTER us were already getting their food. I didn't think much of it. Until a waitress came up to us asking if we paid already... I told him no, we're still waiting on our food. He says okay and he comes back 5 minutes later asking \"are you sure? Because there's nothing in the system for your table\" I told him we've been here for almost an hour and still haven't got our food. Our waitress comes over asking what was wrong. He started rambling on to her that she never put the order in for us. She put it in for another table. She gives a half smile and says sorry. So whatever I let it go cause I just want the food at this point.. We got a pound of shrimp out.. My boyfriend's pound of shrimp. I didn't want to pick at his food cause my food is about to come out. 30 minutes after, he's done with his food and I haven't got mine or the rest of his order. The waitress comes to us with our check trying to charge us everything we ordered but we only ever got one bag of shrimp. He's says he's sorry and he'll have a manager talk to us. I see him talking to the manager, some small Asian female with short hair. She never came to our table, 20 min after I gave up. Paid for the food, went up to the manger myself and told her what was going on. All I got was \"oh I'm sorry, we're new but I'll make sure to put it in so we can improve. Hope to see you again.\" WOW poor poor poor service. Our waitress was so embarrassed to come back to our table after mixing up our order.  Never got my food after 2 hours of sitting there. They need better service. *thumbs down*",

The first time the food was REALLY good, the spice was on point and the shrimp was great. However the crawfish was super small the first time but I think they weren't really in season yet. Kind of wish they warned us about how small they were...this time or most time now I just order the shrimp. I was disappointed today because although the shrimp meat was really good the sauce tasted watered down. Seems like the flavor is usually a hit or miss thing even with their Tempe location so that's unfortunate, would be happier if their flavors were more consistent. Also there seemed to be a lot of bugs flying around us today which was a little annoying but the service was great and everyone kept checking on us which is always nice.",

My advice would be to show up a little early and wait. We got seated right away. We ordered the corn fritters and Cajun calamari to start. We were told that the corn fritters were like hush puppies, which they were not. Although the fritters were not like hush puppies, they were still good. They were small marble sized fried balls filled with almost like a cream corn with whole corn. The calamari was very good. It came fried and with a dry Cajun seasoning on top. We then got the snow crab, hot and juicy medium and the shrimp butter garlic medium. The snow crab was delicious and hot and juicy medium was just right. The shrimp were good, but we both agreed that the hot and juicy would be better on the shrimp next time. The service was great and our drinks were always filled promptly. If you want fancy shmancy, go to Mastros, if you want good, home cooking, finger lickin seafood, go here, you even get a bib.",

We ordered corn fritters, sausage, shrimp, crab, fries, corn, calimari, potatoes. The food came out 1 at a time and in a very odd order. My shrimp came out 20 minutes before my husbands crab. Very uncomfortable for a meal. What we thought was going to be an appetizer came mid meal. There is no designated waiter/waitress which made the experience odd and unsuccessful. We were asked 6 times if we were ready to order after we had already put in our order. Again, the staff were so nice but clearly the training and the overall plan are a mess. Our fries were brought to our table completely frozen. They never hit a fryer at all. We are still trying to figure out how this happened. Frozen, straight from the bag but served to us. This was my husbands birthday dinner, we just laughed. My potatoes were stone cold along with the corn. My shrimp was not deveined which is gross and unsanitary. My husband ordered the crab and only got 3 legs which seems odd. We also had to pay $1 for butter, who serves crab without butter? We had to ask for cocktail sauce for the shrimp, a pail for trash and an extra fork. Someone else mentioned chickens with their heads cut off, that explains the staff exactly. Although working hard, they are misguided. Clearly this restaurant is trying to break the mold, unfortunately they are missing the mark. We left to have deserts at another restaurant. Although our wait staffers tried very hard, we will not return nor recommend this place. Come on, frozen fries? No manager coming to our table to apologize. They all acted that this was not the first time this has happened. Sad sad sad, we had high hopes.",

We have been going to Hot N Juicy for about 3 years now and tend to stick with the Tempe location as every visit we have had to the Glendale one has been horrible. Due to my sister living in Glendale we decided to go to this location for dinner. The food is good we always get the hot n juicy extra spicy shrimp with corn in the bag. It is a hit and miss with the sauce and a lot of the time they tend to overcook the shrimp. Unfortunately last night was one of those times, the shell was so stuck to the shrimp we struggled to peel every single one. The service is always bad at this location all the servers looked like they were in a bad mood. It look a long time to get our drinks refilled and even our check. We were ready for 25 minutes for the check but our server was never in sight. We will continue to go to the Tempe location. As pricey as the food is they should really put more effort into the service and making sure the shrimp is cooked properly as it is their specialty. Every time we go we always spend between $130-$250 for 4-6 people plus 20% tip. I would like to at least have an enjoyable experience.",

Our server, Valentina couldn't have been more attentive. It was our first time and she took the time to explain the menu.   This is our new favorite night out restaurant.",

Let's start from the moment I walked in. Well I walked in and it was a tad busy I got seated in another section on the right side of the building. I had an AMAZING SERVER her name was McKenna (insanely attractive ). Expected the normal type of customer service ya know? But no she blew it out of the water! She got my order and the food came out pretty quick. She kept checking on me making sure everything was perfect just like her. Kept checking up on me and even made sure I never ran out of the little things like more condiments such as sauces and lemons (which I need a lot of for my water). The manager (Maggie) also came up a few times and we had a great talk while she was making sure everything was to my liking and that I was enjoying myself. This staff is pretty amazing even the other servers would check up on me (Haley), would check up on me often it's like I never not had someone checking up on me. I felt like a celebrity. This location prides themselves in customer service and making sure everything is to your liking, you can tell by the way they make you the top priority on their list of things to do. THIS IS A MUST!! If you love sea food with some entertainment from sports, great background music and amazing customer service well this is the place to go!!",

It's missing what I asked for.  Waitress runs away like a thief in the night before I can tell her.  I wait another ice age and she comes back.  I say you forgot my shit.  She leaves again. Jesus comes back to judge us and she returns.  She forgot it again.  She says \"well you are almost done do you still want it.\"  Yes B, I want it!  She never comes back.  Neither do I.

Our food came out quick, we got hawaiian rolls, cajun fries and two pounds of shrimp in the garlic butter mild. Everything was so flavorful. We always come to Hot n Juicy whenever we crave for seafood. This is one of the best seafood place in Phoenix. Our service today was out of the park. Food was great. Make sure you ask for Karen when you come here, she provides the best services.",

    "text": "It's a mixed feeling here.  I have tried this place at least 5 times so here is what I conclude:  Shrimps - I will start off with the good stuff.  This restaurant offers high quality (not live, but still high quality) shrimps that stays consistent!  Strongly recommend.  Clams - They don't always have it but if they do, they are typically live.  Hot N Juicy beats AngryCrab on this one.  Lets hope this continues.  Oysters - If you have read other reviews then you probably already get the idea.  There are some issues with Hot N Juicy's oyster.  It's not because they are not fresh, it's just that their oysters are not stored or/and prepared properly.  I am an oyster lover and for the last 10 years, this is the only restaurant that I will get a diarrhea after having oysters.  STAY AWAY from their oysters if you are on a date or going to a movie later!  Veggie - No veggie here...not sure why.  End up going to AC several times for this reason.  Sausage - Not the best but oh well, it's at least close to average.  Beers - Very little selections.  Service - Great service here, never had any issue.",

The food however, was disappointing. The Dungeness crab was not good. It was over cooked, and served by the pound, but the body of the crab is so heavy we barely got any meat with the 2lbs we ordered. The crawfish were okay if you like them. The only thing that was maybe worth coming back was the snow crab, mussels and the service.",

Server was not focused and didn't explain the menu even though we had asked about a specific item being split. When the bill came there was an issue, when asked about the price the waitress got extremely rude she wasn't very understanding. She insisted that we refer to the menu and the fine print which evidently did not support her claim. A manager was brought in on the situation who as well was very rude. Mind you this is the only table that ordered a lobster that was almost $45 by itself. Instead of Simply fixing the issue she started making remarks and arguing with us which soon turned into her calling security and the police who then forced us to pay the $91 bill. The hole serving crew needs to be completely replaced or we trained by someone who was more fit to be in a manager's position.",

    "text": "Came in a few weeks ago during our weekly date night. Hot N Juicy is located in Glendale's \"premiere\" entertainment district, of which me and my friend Jack N like to refer to as restaurant cemetery. Since I live close by I continue to give these places a chance and more likely than not I'm leaving disappointed. Hot N Juicy was definitely the latter. Upon entering we waited, and waited, and waited to be seated. Mind you it was a Wednesday and the place was maybe 10% full or 90% empty, which ever way you wanna see it. We finally were seated and began small talk with our waitress. We made it clear we were new and have never been. Our server Maria, was friendly to start, made some suggestions and we ordered. My lady ordered some catfish, with a sprite, and me I went for the crawfish with corn and potatoes and a craft brew. Now I've never had crawfish before, but I like trying new things, and figured since it's the name of the restaurant it must be something they do really good. My lady's catfish came out pretty fast, before my brew actually. And was tasty. But they didn't bring the sauce she wanted and kept forgetting it everytime. Finally my bag was tossed on the table. I was baffled at how I would go in for the attack, since I had so bucket, utensils, or anything. I looked around and seen the few others in there eating crawfish with a bucket and some plastic type gloves. I asked and the waitress rolled her eyes like I was some sort of outcast. Finally this bucket came out and I started to go after them. This was all after my lady's plate has been sitting in front of her for about 20 mins. When I opened my bag in noticed the corn was missing. I asked and Maria said I'm she'll bring it out. Well, after 15 mins and two other broken promises my corn was never delivered. When I went to pay the manage Ilse Bernal asked if everything was ok, and I told her, it was ok besides the poor service and not bringing out stuff we ordered. The lady replies with a smart ass remark of, yeah well I'll take off 1$ for the corn. I know I sure as hell ain't gonna pay for something I never received. I also told her I was gonna write a review of how poor they are ran, and she replied with \"good luck with that\". Between that and the snarky remarked they made all night, I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to come running out saying we were on the show Punked. It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. And the sad part is, they were damn near empty. I'd hate to see how this place is ran on a busy night. I wanted to like this place, I really did. It's close and I love fish. But I can't give this place another chance. I will say, the corporate office wrote me back offering a gift card. I might give another location a chance, but not the westgate. Not until that manager is gone or retrained on what customer service is. One positive is with the place being ran like it is, it will be gone soon. Hopefully the next tenant does better.",

    "text": "What a terrible Mother's Day for my wife. It was her 1st Mother's Day and she wanted shellfish now that she can finally eat it. I had a great idea to go here because what I saw on FB, huge crawfish and crabs, lobster, and what a bad choice I made. Nothing like the pictures online. I will say the calamari was wonderful but the Crawfish were the size of my Flippin thumbnail. I took pictures check them out I'll post em. So it is what it is and the server was embarrassed and apologized over and over and it's not his fault. He thought they should be taken off the bill and I agreed since we barley ate the 2 or 3 pounds we ordered. Left most of them on the table and I have photos of that also. So our server (who was awesome) insisted the manager to come over  to check them out after she said no discount to him. So no wanting to she came over.  She saw them and said okay I'll take care it if for you I apologize for that them being tiny. So we order more calamari and shrimp. This is about after and hour. So 30 minutes go by and the calamari finally come out....not even hot. We were hungry so we ate them and also because they are good. 30 min later the shrimp hasn't even made it out yet. So now we are there for two hours and had a little shrimp we started with and two orders or calamari. So we decided to give our card to our server and ask for the shrimp to be bagged up Togo because we still did not get them.i saw he was frustrated for us as we were.  Our card came out and still no shrimp and the bill was outstandingly high at $87.... For what!!!? So our server looked at it and said oh crap she didn't adjust it I'm sorry. So the manager came out and she said \"I did adjust the bill\". I said $87 for 1lb of shrimp, calamari, and two beers!!!? She said \" I took off 10%\" I said huh? 10% off so the bill was about $95 for what!? Are you kidding me? She said \"well you liked the flavor right?\" I was speechless. She acted like a jerk telling me to stop interrupting her and let her talk and explain. I said there is nothing to explain even with seeing most of the crawfish was still on the table and not even touched.....Ohhh and the size of a almond. IM NOT JOKING check the photos. She said again \"well you ate some and like the flavor right?\" I said let me get this straight you want me to pay $60 for crawfish the size of a peanut and we did not eat even 1/3 of?! She walked away!!! We had an outside table next to the entrance and people saw us talking to the manager and they also saw the size of the crawfish even how she (manager) acted. The people said to us are they making you pay for those!!? I said looks like it. A party of 5 left and a couple (husband and wife) walked over and asked to see the crawfish. I said no problem. They were shocked they were so tiny....then replied that manager acted that way knowing you guys have 2 lbs sitting in the table and wants you to pay for that!!!? Yup I said. They looked at each other and shook their heads and walked out of line. Told us thanks for showing them and said they are going elsewhere, I said probably a good idea. The Manger didn't come back nor would she give us an itemized receipt of our lunch. She might have the worst attitude and managerial skills I've ever seen. Then the server came back with our check with cash but we paid for it with a card. She gave us cash back he said because she already ran our card knowing we were unhappy and wanted to talk with her. Anyone ever heard of that!? Lol. I apologized for to my wife and we are going to celebrate Mother's Day again tonight or tomorrow night. Even if they got in crawfish the size of a football I will never go back just because it that woman's attitude. HORRIBLE and the IQ of a door nail. Clean it up Hot N juicy MINI Crawfish.",

    "text": "Yeah the food was good, but everything else was a hot mess.  Super sticky floors in the whole restaurant and in the bathroom, but a little forgiveness was given as it is a seafood-in-a-bag with liquid awesomeness kind-of place. Spills happen. The Price: (everything is ala carte, even the butter) The servers share their tips so we had 3 or 4 different people check on us. This only turned out to be a big problem as orders were taken by different people and corrected by other people and nobody knew what the heck was going on. Order by the LB: -Dungeness Crab $18/LB (served as a whole crab) Turned out it was 1.8lbs and I shared half a crab with my wife. Only got one set of legs for half of $35 and I had to go eat somewhere else afterward. -Kids chicken nuggets. Good, not the best, came with fries and I asked if she could do half reg fries and half Cajun. She said yes and it didn't happen. Another waitress came by and I asked about it and she ran away to charge me for another order of fries. Caught another girl to cancel it. The one who ran away came back and I made sure it was cancelled. It came anyways, twice. Twice also they brought the rolls out that I ordered (3 rolls) with butter. No butter came, just another batch of rolls. A manager came by and it got weird. She eyeballed me and asked \"Did you ask for butter!?\" And I said yes I did originally.. and when I never received the rolls.. and I am asking again now. Got the butter comped. I never thought I would have to utter those words. The butter came and it was a bucket of the liquid butter, as after I asked if something went wrong again I found out that they have no spreadable butter. It seemed very wrong, but tasted ok dribbling down your chin with everything else. My dad got the fried shrimp basket and fries. Pretty awesome tasting grub, the cajun fries and the shrimp were so good my daughters ate half of his instead of their upscale McNuggets. I liked the food, but it was out of any normal price range for the just-ok kids food and shotty service.  $80 and I left with a headache and hungry. Then I went and spent $30 at the yogurt place. Ouch tho",

We moved here 3 years ago and when we saw the renovation for Hot n Juicy at Westgate, we were super duper excited. When it first opened, we went but left completely disappointed. Then, our friends from Las Vegas payed a visit last week and suggested Hot n Juicy. So, we decided to give it another try. Again, our friends and family left disappointed. If we crave Hot n Juicy, we will wait until we visit Las Vegas again. Note to owner: please fix this place. It's not the same and this place is ruining your True reputation.",

    "text": "Tonight was one of many family gatherings at this specific location in Glendale at Westgate, the last time my family came they warned me it may be the last but tonight is definitely the last. After ANOTHER 30 minute wait our table of 10 + (as per usual) was finally seated, told from the beginning we'd have to split the order in 3 bills. Management was not accommodating when multiple orders were incorrect and instead blamed us. The food was good as always, but for the third time our checks were messed up, our waitress charged the wrong orders to the wrong cards and various prices. After which we waited another 20 minutes for a to-go side order of 2 ears of corn and a potato and another 30 minutes for a margarita ordered at the bar that ended up being a shot of tequila for the sake of just leaving at this point. The food is always delicious but the ever changing staff is more inconsiderate with each new group. I don't know where else you can get a decently seasoned pound of ready to peel shrimp and crab legs in this desert but my family and I will be on a mission to find one ASAP! And keep in mind I literally live across the street from Westgate and at this point I'm willing to give the Tempe location a try in hopes for better service, even placing a to go order is like pulling teeth!w",

    "text": "When I was visiting AZ this week, I was so pumped to bring a friend of mine here since he's never been to Hot and Juicy. We came in on Tuesday so it wasn't too busy. I'm a huge fan of the Las Vegas locations so I thought this would be no different. Boy, was I in for a rude awakening.   First, the service. I thought the service was fantastic. Really attentive, and always had refills on my water. The food came out a little slow, but no biggie because I figured it's worth the wait.    Next, FOOD! My absolute favorite thing about Hot and Juicy is their shrimp. Usually, such good flavor, I keep it simple with my seasoning and order sauce on the side for dipping. (Hot N Juicy, Spicy-Can't go wrong) as far as the sauce goes, spot on and literally just like Vegas, maybe a touch spicier but, I'm not complaining. My biggest complaint was the shrimp itself. It literally tasted like MUD and water. It was so incredibly disgusting. It literally had no flavor, was soft, and just, BAD.  Next up, we got the snow crab and mussels. The mussels were really good, but the snow crab was the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. As soon as I put it in my mouth, I was ready to spit it out. I sat there in disbelief and embarrassment. My friend was asking me why the heck I even brought him here. And unfortunately, I was asking myself the same question.  Needless to say, my friend isn't coming back here after such a terrible experience with the food! And now I'm worried about visiting my local Las Vegas locations.",

This place may have tasty food, but it irresponsibly generates a ton of plastic trash.  Your cooked seafood is served to you in a plastic bag and you are expected to eat it from that plastic bag!  It was a culture shock; it's not my cup of tea, and I will not return.  Positive note:  the staff is wonderful.    For the same money, I recommend Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen.",

We were surprised to see that one pound of shrimp was $13.99, I've never seen it that high before.  The food was what I expected. Had lots of flavor and spice. I've been to multiple locations in CA, NV and AZ.  I've noticed that the service is never really great at hardly any of the locations.   Our servers name was Amanda. Our fries, shrimp and crab came out and we asked if our rice was coming out and she kept saying she would check on it. We would see her coming in and out (we sat outside) and still nothing.  One of the other servers noticed that we wanted to ask for something and she was actually the one who brought it out to us.  Amanda came to check on us a few times, but hardly.  We then asked for more lime and she pretty much forgot and brought it to us when our food was gone.   I enjoy the food at Hot N Juicy, but it's hard to actually get good service here.",

Our server didnt ask if we had been there before, so my friend had to explain everything to me/make recommendations.  I got half a pound of shrimp, Hot N Juicy, spicy & 2 potatoes. At first they tried to give my friend the wrong order, & it wasnt really busy so Im not sure how that was messed up. When we did get our food, we had to ask for plasticware & wait for that. The food itself was great! Lots of flavor, garlicky, & definitely SPICY. Maybe next time Ill try the medium.   The shrimp come shell on, head & tail included, but they give you everything NOT to make a mess (gloves, paper towel, bib) & I definitely appreciated that. Hopefully service is better next time!",

For two of us with 1 lbs. each noted above, plus two corn, potatoes, Michelob ultra and a root beer cost under $40, reasonable price in my opinion.  If you've never tried a mud big, be adventurous and hit up Hot n Juicy Crawfish for some Southern flare and flavor. Oh, and don't knock sucking the head of one until you try it.",

I would highly recommend for anyone that loves seafood!",

Everything about this place was awesome; great service, courteous and attentive servers and delicious food.   We had the shrimp and black mussels with Hot & Juicy/Spicy seasoning, and it was SO flavorful AND of course JUICY! My father in law had the snowcrab and loved them. Everything was cooked to perfection. Also tried the Cajun fries, Corn Fritters and Catfish basket, and we were very impressed. Everything was so flavorful right down to the tartar sauce. Prices weren't too high and pretty much priced the same as other places. We will definitely be going back. We used to drive to San Diego to the Crab Hut for seafood like this. I'm glad we have this place close by.   Heather, who I believe was the manager, was very, very nice, and made sure that not only we were being taken care of, but every other customer as well. I wish I had pics to post but we didn't have time for all that while eating all of this deliciousness! Check it out! You won't be disappointed.",

Then they tell us, we don't carry tonic.  Okay, maybe the food was good.  Ordered king crab legs, mussels and oysters.  Not very great food.  I will never go here again.  This was our first and last. Not sure it will stay open.  When your restrooms are disgusting, i didn't feel to confident in the quality of the food. My wife and i were pretty disappointed and grossed out.",

    "text": "We had a friend in town and wanted to do something special for her vist. We decided to go to hot n juicy for the first time since we heard it opened. We were greeted and seated by very friendly staff. Once we ordered our food things started to get a little hectic. We noticed that our corn and potatoes were missing out of ALL 3 of our bags, plus they forgot to include the sausage. We brought this to the attention of the food deliverer Alex and she seemed a little annoyed, but said she would ask the kitchen to fix it. When she came back to deliver the sausage, they didn't label them, so she wasn't sure which one was which. We had a small child with us and needed to know which sausage was the spicy one. Alex seemed very frustrated and irritated by us, so we asked her to send over our server Karen. Karen was absolutely amazing. She listened to our frustrations and offered to immediately fix it. Once she left the table she had her Team Lead Maddie come over. Maddie was stellar in fixing every issue. She got us our corn and potatoes, offered to bring out more sausage with the correct seasoning to ensure it wasn't too spicy for the child and she gave us a discount on our bill. I am very impressed that she was on top of things, constantly checked in to make sure everything was okay and that everything arrived quickly. It's understandable that sometimes things just get mixed up and don't go as planned. It was great that Karen and Maddie acknowledged that there was a problem and apologized for it. Plus went above and beyond. I started the dinner off by saying I wouldn't go back, but now I will absolutely be going back just because of the two of them. Thank you both for everything.",

They are training staff so be patient. The flavors were consistent with other locations but spice was lacking. We got 2lbs of shrimp one medium and one extra spicy, both hot n' juicy(its the only sauce to go with). 1/2 dozen sausage, it was good but can skip. One corn just for the craving but totally overcooked frozen piece of corn. Overall its a great place. I hate the crawfish is so tiny and for that reason i skip it. Try it you wont be disappointed if you like seafood. Ps - make sure they make it spicy if you like spicy food.",

I've given this location a few tries, each time hoping they've improved, but enough is enough.   The service is horrible, even after they supposedly flew in all-star staff from other locations to train the staff after their horrible launch during the super bowl. They always have empty tables and a ton of staff wandering around like they dont know what to do, yet their service is so slow and unorganized.  Not sure if they franchised this location, regardless, they need to fire the franchisee or the manager. Food comes out luke warm at best, wrong order or at random times so everyone at the table feels awkward that only one person has food.   Seriously, who gives you your rice 20 min before your seafood??? So that when you actually eat the rice with the entree it's already cold and nasty.   Plus their revolving door of newbie servers suck as if they hire anyone. Their crappy servers just provide justification for their screw ups and defend their \"backed up\" kitchen. My wife ordered a pound of shrimp and what came out was definitely not a pound, instead only 9 pieces of luke warm shrimp. All the server did was say \"oh, the kitchen double checks the weight, that's one pound.\" What a complete idiot. We had to grab the assistant manager ourselves who fixed the situation fast. He's probably the only bright person working there. He's a skinny asian dude that has served us before. If you actually still want to try this location, you'll be lucky if you get him. The rest of the staff have no idea what customer service is.   My advice: go to a different Westgate restaurant or if you want similar food, go to Angry Crab instead. They know how to treat their customers.",

There was a 45 minute wait so we got ourselves on the waitlist. 20 minutes later we get a text saying they were ready for us. Once we got there we were taken to our table and had our drinks brought out to us. After our server took our order, she went back inside since we were seated outside. 40 minutes later, and still no sign of our server or our food. We see everyone who came after us get served their food, so we flagged down our server who said the kitchen said it would be a couple more minutes. So we then ask to speak to the manager and she goes to get the manager. An hour later since we ordered, the server comes back to our table and tells us that she put in our order five minutes after she took it but because of the long delay, she was told to pay for our meal because she will get in trouble if she doesn't. When she told us that she'd get in trouble if she didn't pay for our meal, she started to tear up, and We felt so uncomfortable and felt bad that again we asked for the manager. About ten minutes later the manager came to our table and we told her everything that has been going on and that we didn't think it was right to make the server pay for our meal for having us wait more than an hour for our food. The manager said she had no idea what was going on that she had to go back in to \"figure it out\". The manager then comes back out to our table and tells us to not worry about our meal. We then tell the manager that we don't want the server to pay for our meal because it makes us feel uncomfortable and that it isn't right to treat the servers in that manner. The manager then proceeds to tell us that we can then pay for our meal, which we tell her that we shouldn't have to for waiting now OVER an hour for both our meals. When the server came back to us, she tells us that it was fine that she would pay for it but we made it clear to the manager and the server that we didn't want the server to pay for our meal because it was not fair. All in all, my mother and I did not have a great experience at this location. Especially since the manager didn't act like a manager at all. It's insane how someone like her is in charge and how she treats her servers and customers.",

I know CRAZY but it's new & this gave me hope that its beyond yummy. So we cruised in for a week day lunch & we both tried shrimp with diff sauces & both liked it. The shrimp were not deveined so be warned. The fries were good, crispy & seasoned well. They had local beers from Four Peaks on tap & I love me some Peach so that great. The staff work in a group so that's kind of nice because you can ask anyone for a refill of H2O etc. The prices are on par but we won't be back again until the shiny newness wear off. A 2 hour wait for shrimp that don't knock your socks off is just way too long.  FYI... I tried to post a tip about the wait both times it was removed by HnJ. Shame on you HnJ. It wasn't negative just a fact. So you lose a star for being douches.",

    "text": "Pros:  Nice place with a good vibe Wait list is your cell phone number, so you can walk around and get a text when your table is ready Unique dining experience with the bags/gloves  Prices: For those looking for prices, it goes by market - Fish ranged from about $9.99lb on the low end for shrimp to $25/lb for lobster. Crab seemed to be about $15/lb. They don't mix items (so 1/2 lb of crab and 1/2 lb crawdads) but you can split with your table. Sides are extra.   Cons: Food comes out staggered - so you have no idea what will be delivered. Example: a bowl of rice came out 10 mins before the main course that went with it. My food came out long before my friends. Meaning everyone sits with their food getting cold waiting for the rest of the table to get their food.  Inside has a very STRONG fish smell. Kind of what you'd think the inside of a crowded  3rd world women's prison would smell like. The patio was much nicer.   Limited items for people who don't like seafood - and by this, I mean zilch. Chicken nuggets. Our server told us we could go anywhere around the restaurant, buy food we liked and bring it back to eat there. WTF?  Lastly - spice level could be explained better. A mild hot n' juicy spice was far too hot for several in our party, but a medium garlic butter spice was much calmer.   It wasn't spectacular and while I applaud the uniqueness, it wasn't a good mix for a party that had varying love/hate on seafood.  Update: Shortly after writing this review, the manager contacted me and offered a $20 credit to come back and try it again. She offered to retrain the staff on spice levels etc. A nice gesture, but I turned her down. There are too many places to eat in Phoenix to go back to one that fell so short.",

I think our waitress saw our timer dammit but even so it was quite a wait here's the break down  2min - had drinks (usually this alone is 6-10min) 14 min - had fried calamari appetizer 16 min-checked on us for the 1st time since drinks 19 1/2 min - shrimp basket finally came 21 min - crab legs came finally So overall compared to prior visits waiting 30/40min+ for food wasn't too bad.

The mussels came out 20 minutes later at room temperature, except for one that was somehow ice cold.  I can't figure out how they pulled that off.  As for the shrimp and crawfish, I can't say because our bill arrived before they did so I just had them remove it so we could get to the hockey game.  We got the standard apology along with the excuse that they were behind because it was so busy.   I guess they would prefer an empty restaurant so they could provide better service.  I was really looking forward to this visit because I like the concept and love fresh seafood.  I suppose I will have to continue looking for a good experience because I don't think this place is capable of delivering.",

    "text": "Ok so I've been to the Westgate Hot N Juicy twice now. One if my wife's favorite restaurants to we will be going even more seeing the Westgate location is much closer than the Mill ave one.   I've given the Mill location a 5 star rating. Westgate gets 4 based only on the service. That understandable seeing it's brand new. They just haven't gotten the service thing down as of yet. From working in the service industry way back when..I can understand how it takes a little bit for things to run smoothly.   Came last night on a Monday and was quoted 1.5 hours wait!! I would normally just walk off but after looking around I knew it was shorter. I was explained that half of the restaurant is closed due to lack of servers. Saw I. A previous Yelp review that something was said like that to the, as well. Maybe Hot N Juicy is having trouble hiring or keeping qualified servers??    I was right, our wait was a little bit more than 35 mins,,,just enough time to run to Yard House for a drink before our dinner. We had two servers at first, then one after our order was taken. Both of them were friendly. We ordered lb of clams, lb of snow crab and crawfish etouffee.   Man the clams and crab was amazing. Both in Hot N a Juicy med flavor which is my favorite!! Not too hot, but hot enough to feel the heat after the meal.   The crawfish etouffee wasn't good this time around. Way too oily. We ordered it on our last time here and it was great, but after this experience I will probably choose not to order it. I would have sent it back today but the funny thing was that we got asked how we were doing repeatedly before our food, but couldn't find anyone while we were eating. I finally had to flag down a server for extra water and I thought I would confuse him too much so we just pours out the extra oil and filled it up with hot n juicy sauce and mad it even better!   The food was amazing, price point not bad at all..the only thing lacking is the service, but I'm sure that will get better when they can hire more. I really think Hot N juicy will be here for the long haul and we will be back!",

She explained the menu to us, gave us advice on what to get, & always had our drinks refilled the entire time (very hard to achieve when my husband drinks like a camel)!  We ordered 1 pound of crawfish & 1 pound of shrimp, both with the hot n juicy seasoning. Both were delicious but the crawfish had little meat & super hard to open. Next time we are definitely just getting the shrimp! The seasoned fries were awesome!  Overall, we loved it. Will definitely be back.

So we don't get seated or served until more servers come in! So us getting food/service relies solely on if or when more servers come in. Clearly this is a horrible place to work because they have no servers for the amount of customers. So if you're looking for work avoid this place like the plague.

I've been on hold for a little bit more than 13minutes, I guess my business isn't welcomed here.",

The food was absolutely flavorful and again Amazing. I had the hot and juicy shrimp (mild) with corn and potato. Yummmmm! I am a heavy spicy eater and the mild was enough spicy-ness for me. I had to order some more to go. So happy that I decided to stop and experience this place and definitely will be back.",

After the shock wore off and I established a technique for acquiring meat from the carcass it wasn't too bad. We got crawfish and shrimp and I definitely preferred the shrimp as they had more meat. The crawfish were sort of a waste of time to eat because there was so little that was able to be eaten.  I wouldn't recommend coming here if you value not smelling like a sea creature, aren't a fan of wearing bibs and gloves while you eat, or if you just don't like the idea of cracking open a crustacean for it's meat.",

The waitress spend 10 minutes to give us our drink, and took a lot of time whenever we asked for something, also, some of them served us with a not happy face, and I don't know why.

For whatever reason, this location has the best shrimp, always fresh, sweet, and never overlooked. I always get 1lb (or more!) of shrimp, with hot n juicy spices and medium heat, and it never disappoints. Perfect blend of spices, lots of garlic, and a ton of butta! Chicken tenders/wings are a perfect way to balance the heat. Definitely a place where you have to okay with getting down and dirty to eat and be okay breathing garlic for the rest of the evening. Food has always been consistent times I've been.   Service is a a different story and never has been consistent. I've had really great service, where my drink never reaches the bottom, or like tonight where we asked 4 times for ranch and twice for drink refills. Fortunately the food is good and the shrimp keeps bringing me back!",

Please owner fix this matter and make your costumer happier and they will recommend other people for you because this problem is easy to fix. Ths  Hopefully it will be better bc I love crawfish",

It was my first experience at this restaurant and things couldn't have been worse. To start off, the waitress (who was training someone new, yikes) only was at our table to take our order. After that, she never returned. On top of that, the food took over an hour to come out. Two tables that sat down after we ordered got their food before us. The manager came out and informed us that they lost the ticket. Okay, that could be forgiven and understood had their been some sort of communication from the waitress (had she bothered to check on us). Then, the story changed. The lost ticket never printed and it was a computer malfunction. Working in the industry, my girlfriend and I both knew immediately that the drastic change in the story meant the waitress never rang in the order!! We were offered a 25% discount and a $20 credit for our next visit. Truly, I would give 0 stars for the horrendous service. The two stars is for the food. It was delicious and flavorful as expected but it wasn't enough to get the bad taste of lousy service and management out of our mouths.",

The pound of shrimp translated into about 6-7 large shrimp and  a few crawfish. The edible portion of the meal was only about 15% with most of it being the potato and corn. Wouldn't go back.",

How could that be even possible if other tables that came after us got their food?? We cancelled our orders and their excuse was that the orders got mixed up with others.

Most recently, I went- Mother's Day weekend because I was alone, and needed some good king crab. Over the phone ordered for pickup, but when I learned that I could sit, I let the order taker know to not make it, I would be coming in to order. Apparently they still made it to my surprise. I come in, and the I'm assuming manager with her uppity ass made me feel like it was MY mistake that the order taker made a mistake. She looked at me like I was a problem. Didn't want to sit me, and let me know she didn't want to sit me and told me not to do it again. If this wasn't the only place I knew of that had the best crab broil I would've went home. I sat, ate my crab, and left but I'll never forget this experience where as I didn't think it was a big deal but then again THE ORDER TAKER MADE A MISTAKE. Won't be back. Good job making me feel like less than. Good food. Shitty attitudes for the waitresses, manager, and whoever takes the orders over the phone.",

First I didn't appreciate how you looked in the trash bucket after I told you about the 3 corn on the cob I never got, just to make sure I wasn't lying.  Second, I love how you kept reassuring about how my muscles just need to open up and it only took 50 minutes, I counted 12 empty muscles out of 16 and 4 of them fell out of their shell, did you get hungry along the way?  Last, all I asked was for you to check on my brownies and you immediately snapped back \"no\" without checking. Maybe it was the fact that I had a newborn baby and a child that had to go to school along with it being 10pm that I request for you to do me a simple favor.  I appreciated the management to compensate me $20 credit for the brownies taking 30 minutes. It still does not make up for Amanda's work ethic.  Also all the cash tip I left was for Daniela who was not my server but just the simple fact that she kept checking up on me was all that I requested.",

Considering that nothing is peeled or cleaned,  I have no idea why this is so.   We ordered a half pound of shrimp and a pound of snow crab. They were eventually delivered in plastic bags. After wrestling the meat from the shells we are messy, grumpy, and still hungry.   The side sweet potato fries for $6 was flavorless.   I don't believe I will come again. After removing the heads and legs from my shrimp I was left with little to eat. And it was gross. I feel like I need a Silkwood shower.  Eta: the waitress had see thru leggings. You could see her too small panties. I am not sure she intended to look like that, she seemed sweet, but where was management?",

Our waiter is very nice and friendly but we wanted to put in another order and we didn't see him for about 20 minutes or so.

The server constantly said everything else comes out in increments, which is not True since every other table got there food before us. She continued arguing until I asked for a manager, who was unhelpful as well. Our food was not sent to the kitchen because they said the kitchen just received our order.

Spoke to a manager from here who was so kind and really seemed like they wanted to do better and I gave it another chance and had a better experience but have been back twice again since and it just gets worse and worse. Came here for a friends birthday and we had almost a two hour wait. We had a large party so that was fine but what blew my mind was how our food came out. First my daughter gets her food literally within 5 minutes of ordering. Then minutes later I hear the table behind me complaining there missing their kids meal so I guess they gave it to us on accident. So se was done so fast before any of us it to eat. Everyone's food took FOREVER But my food and one others came out SO Late!! So everyone got there food and 45 minutes after they did I finally got mine. So everyone else's took about 45 minutes to come. Mine took 90 minutes!  Apparently they gave my food to somebody else. So they had to redo it. I finally get my food and everyone's already almost  done eating so I'm trying to hurry. I bite into my potato and it is FROZEN! I mean literally ice cold!! And my shrimp was rubbery which I don't know if it was under cooked or over cooked but I already waited so long to get my food I didn't wanna wait another hour to remake it. I usually love their shrimp so much but this just had a weird texture and my hot and juicy spicy tasted so different than usual, it was extra watery. They replaced my potato which literally took 20 minutes for a SINGLE potato. Also they had no lemons when I asked for the salt and pepper with them. I asked for refills so many times and never received them I had to actually walk up myself and ask for one. I felt awful because it was so many people's first time and I told them how good it was and they all said they were never coming back again. Really need to work on their staff I can understand a bad day but everytime I come in something's bad happens. I hate to give lower than a 3 review because their food taste amazing but the service is just so disastrous that I don't feel right keeping my 5 stars.",

She never acknowledged or even apologized.  I finally got to order and I believe her name was KAYANA was very rude. She kept tapping her nails against the counter basically rushing me for no reason & then she rolled her eyes at me?? We finally get our food without the drinks, or napkins or gloves or anything besides or food. I literally had to wait an extra 10 minutes because   they all ignored me. I asked someone for limes and she rudely said you're going to have to wait. So I left and to tie everything up when I finally got home I had ordered 3lbs of shrimp and I only got 2.

Every thing was amazing, but the mild was pretty spicy!!!! Like runny nose spicy! The only reason I give 3 stars is because we both got sick when we got home.....maybe it was the all the spiciness? But the food and service was excellent!",

    "text": "Very poor experience. Asked for Dungeness crab. more like Dungeness watery crap. I asked if it could be put in the ice bucket after cooking as I like it fresh and cold. the waitress said they couldn't put it on ice in case something went wrong. ??????  I asked if they would bring ice. that seemed to work. Duh. Any body that's been to the west coast, i.e.: fisherman's Warf in San Fran knows what Dungeness should taste like and texture. the crabs at hot and juicy are all cooked in the same spicy water as every thing else.. the crab was under cooked because the white inside meat was sloppy and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwet.it&s=933dddc3386681de2c290a7bf3a35531568b4310b7973f608c222d4bda9e064b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wet.it</a> had a muddy taste like the boiling water was old. My wife's food came out first followed closely by the crab. too quick from the time of ordering, no where near enough time to cook a 2 lb crab. My daughter ordered shrimp. that NEVER arrived. after touching base with the waitress she said kitchen was backed up. repeatedly told us about the backup and yet people who had came in after us had their food..... don't bulls@!t me. they lost the order. After speaking with the manager. she had no clue about seafood in general. she has never eaten crab so she couldn't comment. I would make it a priority to taste and be knowledgeable of all the food I would be serving. On recap don't go there. Food poor. service poor and it wont belong before somebody gets sick.  Pete P",

Let me warn you, the mild is definitely spicy. The only complaint I had was that the food didn't come out all at once. My parents had to wait for some of their food 20 min after I had my food come out. But overall, this is a nice place to eat some decently priced seafood.",

Had the oysters which were medium size and surprisingly good although the wait staff had no idea where they were from. This location saw the service as very slow and we waited about 25 minutes for appetizers and we were the first ones in when the doors opened. If you like a little spice the. The extra spicy is probably what you want as it's not that spicy at all. Improvements needed but it has potential. I'd take Flavors of Louisiana in Goodyear for more authentic Cajun.",

Funny enough I had the opposite problem of reviewer Sns T N, I specifically asked for a corn on the cob and a potato to be placed in each bag.  Guess what was missing from the king crab bag?  A potato.  Also, I'm not a big fan of spice, and so I asked for both bags to be mild.  The shrimp bag wasn't a problem, but once again the king crab legs bag was too spicy :(. I took my order home as this was a take out order.  I didn't discover the potato difficiency until I got home.  Also, I was a little disappointed that they didn't include some wet naps and some bibs in my to go bag.  And so, in conclusion, if you order take out from the Glendale AZ store, 1) check the contents of the bag before leaving and 2) ask for some wet naps and bibs.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place as cajun food and crawfish and gulf shrimp special to my heart. The meal began great with no wait and a very friendly and encouraging hostess who sat us promptly and explained the concept. We ordered the crawfish, clams, shrimp and snow crab. Each arrived at different times in plastic bags but within 20 minutes from ordering. I am a chef, so maybe I see things that others don't. The shrimp were served head on which should be reserved. for only fresh caught as the brains spoil within a day and these had been spoiled a few days ago. The heavy spiced sauce covered the taste. The clams were good and tasty but 8 shells per pound had no clam inside which was a letdown. I scoured the bottom of the bag hoping to find the missing clams to no avail, they must be in the boil pot which made me disappointed to psy for just shells. The snow crab was mushy and does not pare well with the over spiced sauces, my ordering fault. Our server was friendly but we never saw her again after taking iur order but maybe they share tables as we were serviced by 3 others. All in all a unique idea but lacking in quality fot the price paid. I almost want to try again as I love crab and shrimp boils but to spend $60 for 2 to walk away hungry and question the quality is too much for me. I wish them well but will not be back or reccomend.",

So... my friend and I went to Hot and Juicy (Glendale, AZ) on the 4th. The host was great and we expected a wait time of at least 30 min so we went across the way to have a drink at The Yard House. We were there 5 min, before we ordered a drink, and received a text that our table was ready. We went back to Hot and Juicy and got seated in a spot we really liked. Our server's name was Aquan and I have to say that it was great service from start to finish. Very personable and attentive... explained the menu with no hesitation and even suggested a few things. We never felt rushed, even though it was pretty busy, and never had to wait for service. We made sure to let his manager Bri? know of his exceptional service. I usually go to Angry Crab but after the service we received, and the Hot and Juicy sauce mix, this will be my go to place! I always like to acknowledge great food and ESPECIALLY great service!",

We went with baby spice and it was still a little spicy. Man this was good flavors I have never experienced before.  Get white rice let the juices soak up the rice then prepare for awesome.   This is one of those places I am afraid to come back I liked it so much I am afraid it won't be as good.  Come here now.... super fun experience not sure if its first date fun but awesome.",

    "text": "Let me say this first, we didn't have a bag of seafood, which seems to be their main item.  I'm not a crawfish fan, and don't like crab in the shell (unless they're stone crabs, which most places around here do not carry) or oysters.  That being said, I also have an issue with food that can look at me.  Anyway, hubby really wanted to check out this place, so we decided to try it.  However, since the baskets are also on the menu, I would assume they should be just as tasty as anything else.  We started with the corn fritters, which are more like corn nuggets.  I think of fritters as being a little bigger...but, they were very good.  Like little bites of corny goodness.  They were better without the mayo sauce they served with them.  We both ended up getting the fried shrimp baskets...hubby with their cajun fries, me with regular fries.  Now, herein lies the problem we both seemed to have.  The shrimp batter is really crunchy, but there's way too much of it.  The shrimp are butterflied, which flattens them out.  All I tasted was \"crunch\".  The shrimp definitely weren't being tasted and, unfortunately, the batter had no flavor.  I attempted to peel off some of the batter, but that didn't seem to help much...still no flavor.  The fries were decent, but hubby didn't realize his would be so spicy.    That being said, the service was good.  Our waitress was very friendly and fun to talk to.",

It did come out pretty quick which is a first. Unfortunately we did have to send back our shrimp for being undercooked. I would hate to get sick.   The waiter did take it back and offered to get us a fresh new batch.  He also came back and offered us  some free beers on the house. Most places would just apologizes and give you a Comp or dessert.   Overall our shrimp came back over cooked but it was still a average experience",

Once there, they got our drink order and then food order as usual. Then the server changed. We still got everything we ordered, but with the change there was a little confusion.   When the food arrived, it was hot...but not juicy! It was in an inch or two of hot sauce, and you had to dredge the sauce just to find the shrimp. The seasoning they use is just too much. It's actually overkill.   I don't plan in going back. I was hoping for some solid Cajun food and got slop.  Totally not impressed!",

My wife and I both enjoy seafood so we gave H&J a shot. She ordered the Shrimp H&J style with baby spice. As for me I had the Crawfish H&J style medium heat with sausage add-on. We also ordered the chicken wing appetizer. We had asked if the chicked wings were breaded and we're told no. When we recieved them they were breaded. We just pulled the breadding off and ate them. The wings were good and cooked throughout. I didnt like that they had no seasoning on them. My wifes shrimp came out and half were good the other half were mushy. (Sign of old or refrozen shrimp.) The staff was great about it and brought out another half pound that were good. The crawfish was good as well. Well seasoned and tasty. Beware of ordering the crafish though. You are going to put in some worj if you order these mud bugs because you have to peel the armor of a shell off of it. But the taste is worth it. We liked H&J but the price was a little steep for what we got. Not a bad place at all though. I would definitely go back.",

Server showed up a few minutes later and asked if we had been served.  When the food showed up, the server checked the tag on the bag, but did not check if everything was in there. (Potatoes and Corn) Took 5 minutes to flag someone down and let them know. But she didn't do anything about it and let our server know. She came and asked what was missing with an attitude.  When she came back with the potatoes and corn, we were pretty much done with our crawfish and shrimp. Then she asked why we were not using a bucket for our shell pointing to the pile on the table, ummm, first time there, didn't know about the bucket. Again, attitude.  Food was OK, having spent 5 years on the Gulf Coast, I have had way better, but this is Arizona so I will give them credit.",

Took awhile for beers to arrive. We then waited 30+ minutes before our server came to our table but only because we signalled to him. He apologized for our wait. Another 15+ minutes passed with no further contact. My son chased after the server and said we'd just like our check and we were no longer interested in crawfish. Paid bill - no tip - and went to front of house where my son asked for the managet. He told her our story to which she replied \"Oh I only manage the front of the house, not the kitchen.\" WHAT??? She then asked if we'd stay if she gave us 2 pounds of crawfish for free. Um.....no, we've been here over an hour and have not been served what we ordered right off the bat. We went to In'n'Out Burger and had a delicious meal that was ready in 5 minutes even though it was very crowded!",

    "text": "I was with a party of four and arrived at 8pm. We were told there was a 20 minute wait, which we were OK with. We ended up being seated about 30 minutes after waiting... which again was OK. The service seemed OK for the first 30 minutes but it progressively worsened. We ordered 8 pounds of various things (excited to try everything). About thirty minutes after being seated, we got an order of soft crab and a pound of clams. The clams were delicious! About 20 minutes later, we got 2 pounds of crawfish. Again, the crawfish was delicious. The seasoning they use is amazing! We ordered extra spicy and while it was very spicy, the taste was extremely flavorful and perfect for those who like very spicy food. More than an hour had passed from the moment we were first seated and we had yet to get the rest of the food we had ordered. When we asked about it we were told that there had been a ticket mishap and the rest of our food wasn't being made... this didn't make sense since a couple of the things we had ordered made it to our table. We were told it would be a few minutes. Again, more than 15 minutes passed and by that point we were extremely frustrated and disappointed. The servers seemed disorganized and kept asking what they had already brought and what we were still missing. We ended up canceling the remaining of our order and although the server said she would be speaking to the manager, there was no compensation or apology from the manager. Although the food (that we got to taste) was fantastic, the service was a shame!! The waitresses were nice (but couldn't get the job done). The overall experience was bad. We were there to try various foods and instead left disappointed because they failed to bring out all of the food we ordered within almost a two-hour time frame. To top it off, when the bill came, we were being charged for food that never made it to our table.",

When we first got there we were greeted right away and seated quickly but after that it was not a good experience.  1st off we ordered regular crawfish and not frozen but they brought frozen and it is put directly on bag what was ordered. We would have advised them of the mistake but once they were brought to us no one checked on us for about 20 minutes and then Ashley came to our table to let us know she would be taking over for the guy that was 1st waiting on us.  we also had some beers because they had penny specials since there was a Cards game going on but they never came to check on us or ask if we needed anything...I actually wanted to order something else but by the time someone came around I just wanted to leave already.  Right behind the booth we sat at was the POS system and although there was several people at that little station, know one would ask how it was or if we needed anything.  Definitely don't waste your time, it was our 1st time there and definitely out last!",

We will call on our way and see if Blue Crab is in they always seem to say, we had it the day before but sells out quickly.  Was told by Manager they get their shipment in on Fridays, went there today and low and behold no blue crab!  I ordered  my usual shrimp hot and juicy extra spicy.  Love the spice its hot but enjoyable, the only disappointing thing is the shrimp are sometimes mushy and hard to peel from their shell.   On on our last visit,told the manager about this and she stated that next time tell them not to cook too much.  Today we did tell our server who mentioned to the cooks and still had shrimp hard to peel.  That is disappointing for the price that you pay per pound, however again the sauce was hot and enjoyable.  Cajun fries are very yummy wish they were served with something other than ketsup.  A nice remoulade sauce or ranch would be awesome.  Our server Philip was excellent!  He was very attentive and provided excellent service. Would give him 5 star review.",

We saw three servers/employees attend to the spill. They used their bare hands to wipe the floor and pick up ice, have their bare hands all over your the dirty mop bucket and mop head. This would not have been an issue if any of them would have went to wash their hands before continuing to serve drinks and food. One of these employees was even grabbing the cups by rim with her dirty hands and serving drinks to customers in them! I did bring this to the managers attention, who seemed disinterested and blew me off by say, \"don't worry\" and \"I got it right now\" as he turned away and didn't let me finish what I was saying. He then said to the employees, \"everyone wash your hand\", which no one did! Needless to say, I will not be returning or recommending this establishment to anyone! I will make the extra 20 min drive to Angry Crab where the staff is friendly and sanitary and the food is better.",

We ordered extra Hot N Juicy sauce, it came out room temp. I would suggest they heat it up before serving it. I really loved how they gave you gloves to wear so your hands don't get dirty. Be prepared to have a messy meal. I also loved that I got to eat the clams with my hands as they were. That was so not proper but this restaurant isn't like that. We also ordered rolls to eat with the sauces. We ordered the soft shell crab as a side, it cam on top of fries. That was a bit too much grease for me so next time I'll just stick with one of the Juicy Cravings. Beer goes great with their food. The service was very good as well.",

One couple ordered corn which hadn't arrived 45 minutes later. Requested corn from multiple people with no luck. After husband got testy, the corn was finally delivered......at end of meal.

They took our drink order. We asked if they had juice for the kids they said cranberry juice and orange juice we took cranberry juice. I got water with lemon one of us got iced tea another one got a beer. I ordered fried shrimp $12.99 with an order of fries for 399 my son and wife ordered a pound of crab to split and we got chicken nuggets for the kids to split we also ordered a side of rolls with butter. It seemed kind of funny they took our order with different waitresses they said we all work together don't worry about it I told my son I don't think this is going to work out. They brought the order my kids got the crab my grandkids got the chicken and I got the fried shrimp I told the lady I haven't gotten my price yet she said maybe they forgot let me go see if the order was put in I said if they haven't made them yet make him the cajun fries we have plenty of regular fries with the childrens chicken nuggets.  the waitress left the check on the fries and we realized we hadn't gotten our rules yet another waitress walked up and said is everything okay we should we haven't received our roles yet with butter she returned with the rules and no butter I said excuse me she said just a moment and then the other waitress walked up s*** is everything okay your fries are coming I said we haven't received the butter for the rolls she said did you ask for it I said three times she said I'll go check on it she came back with a bucket of melted butter and an order of regular fries I said we change the order to cajun fries she said let me check on that the other waitress came up I said why do we have melted butter that's all we have I said well I don't want rolls with melted butter she said will take that off your order sir I said no problem by then we were done eating they brought me the bill as I was looking at the bill they brought out another order of rolls and 2 orders of Cajun fries I said I don't want two orders of Cajun fries as a matter of fact now I don't want any cajun fries we're done eating we're leaving and we cancel the rules and never ordered another order so they took care of everything took everything off the bill that wasn't supposed to be there all we got charged for was the crab the fried shrimp the chicken nuggets 1 lemonade when I see one beer 1 cranberry juice by the way that cost $4.50 the beer only cost $4 total came to 80 dollars  2 kids split an order of chicken nuggets the adults in order of crab by the way it was about a quarter pound of crab or less and the rest we shall and guts 80 dollars food was mediocre service was terrible had a very bad experience did not enjoy my meal whatsoever",

And I was confused by everything, so I asked the server, \"Do we get plates at all?\" And she said \"Your table's kind of your plate.\" Real nice. So I guess I should've known better, but at the end when I asked for a to go box, we just got another grocery bag. The food did take a long time because that place is PACKED. I don't know why, though. And it was really annoying to have to peel everything ourselves. I've never done that before so it was really difficult to do all that and barely get anything to eat after all the work you do. It was very messy. And that place is pretty expensive, so I guess I expected to be served a little classier for that amount of money. If I ever do get their food again, I would get it to go so that I can have my dinner on a plate like a civilized person.",

I mean I love my mom to, but come on we JUST said we should go! Anyway, enough about my thoughts about my wife and lets get to my thoughts on Crawfish. We went here in the middle of the day so it wasnt that busy which was nice because we got a table right away and got the full attention of the staff. Everyone that came to our table was very nice and joked around with us so no complaints there. I dont like the Outback way of pricing which is charging for every little thing on the menu. You want fries? Boom! 3 bucks! You want butter? Boom! 2 bucks! Bread? Hahaha! If you have to ask you cant afford it. I mean I cant atleast get some fries with my shrimp or atleast 2 rolls with my crab? Its a very annoying practice that might be the main reason I will never go back. The shrimp we ordered was good and I actually liked taking the shell off myself and that goes the same for the crab. I also ordered the calamari, but for 10.99 a basket I would not recommend it. What I can about my trip is the staff was friendly, but the food and sides are expensive, plus dont go with a woman who likes to go places without you.......",

Sometimes for my lunch break because I work really close and sometimes bringing my family for dinner and the service has always been pretty crappy.  But the food is great so I kept going back.  Well today, I went with a friend for our lunch break we were literally the first people in the place and 40 minutes later I still didn't have my food.  Since I was on my lunch break, I needed to get back to work and after a waitress FINALLY came over I told them this.  They went to check on the food and still needed 4 more minutes - this would not leave me enough time to eat my food before having to return to work. The only thing they offered was to bag my stuff up to go when it was ready but bringing back HNJ crawfish and shrimp to my cubicle in an office didn't seem like a viable option for me. That was it. So, my friend got to slowly eat alone (in anticipation that my food would come eventually) and I literally got nothing but a 'sorry'.  I heard there's a Boiling Crab or something similar opening up in the area soon and I can't wait since I really love this style of food but am truly sick of the horrible service that this location has to offer.  I've given them many chances in hopes that the service would improve but I have definitely been let down beyond repair.",

We ordered 2 lbs of Louisiana style shrimp,1lb of lemon pepper clams, and 1lb of Louisiana style crawfish. Our 2lb Louisiana style shrimp came out first. I expected Louisiana style to be flavorful but instead it was flavorLESS. I asked for butter to dip my shrimp since its so flavorless and again, the butter tasted watered down. Absolutely NO FLAVOR in the butter either. The clams and crawfish came out and we set the other half of shrimp aside. The lemon pepper clams was most flavorful and delicious out of everything. As for the crawfish, no flavor as expected. Instead of the butter, we ended up dipping our shrimp and crawfish in the lemon pepper sauce since it was more tasty. The lemon pepper sauce is what gave them one star. Never coming back here again. Waste of money.",

    "text": "First time I had H&J was in Vegas and it was really good. I actually prefer it than Boiling Crab but then when they opened one up in Arizona one in tempe later in Glendale. I had horrible experience in both restaurants. Tempe is just hard to find parking, very long wait and food was salty. In Glendale about the same, even though west gate is a big place it can get quite pack and hard to find parking. Usually the wait is 20-30 min but sometimes can take up to an hour. My first exp at H&J in Glendale,AZ was pretty good, shrimp was on point and so was the crab but then my 2nd visit they were missing 2 orders, I ended up cancelling it. On my third visit, the waiters always forget to refill my water and my orders came in extremely late when they were about to close again I ended up cancelling it. 3rd visit same experience and on my last visit again kitchen was supposedly backed up and they didn't bring out my snow crabs. The worst part of it all  the my garlic butter shrimp was extremely dry, the meat inside felt so hard, the shells were crispy and overcooked. I had to speak to a manager and all they said was were backed up. Do yourself a favor go to Angry Crab, nice people, no to a little wait and better food. If you don't mind traveling a bit far.",

In fact, only one brand of any liquor. Some cheap bourbon instead of Jack. First thing we noticed was there was no adult supervision in the place. Just a bunch of kids serving and seating. It took an hour and a half to get a table and it was a four top that they shoved five chairs and a high chair in front of. Sure glad our sixth person was a no show. Food was ok, eating out of a plastic bag with no plate, fork or knife was an adventure. Just not one I will be repeating soon or often. Not worth the effort. Should have left after an hour wait.  I know they are newly opened, but really an hour and a half. They could have seated us at 45 minutes had they shoved two tables together. But they were waiting for another large party to leave while the were seating parties if two and four.  Customer service is clearly not a priority here. Might try them again in a year or so, if they are still open.",

We ordered the get your feet wet deal which came with sausage, crawfish and shrimp, it also came with 2 red potatoes and 2 corn both corn and potatoes have no taste.  I got the hot and juicy sauce which to me was spicy but i dont like spicy food at all so if you like spice it probably wont be a problem for you.  For my first time eating crawfish it was okay its an expensive fish for the amount of meat in the shell, the sausage tasted like a kielbasa sausage but a little tender and then shrimp well tasted like shrimp, just like what i ordered if you want to get your feet wet this is a good place to start!",

Get a pound of shrimp and a pound of clams with a corn and potato in hot n juicy baby spice or mild. Simply the best! That combination will have you running back about every two weeks! The spice runs on the hotter side, my husband who eats siracha or tabasco sauce on everything thinks the medium is too hot for him at times so that's why I recommend baby spice or mild. Oh and don't forget the Cajun fries and fried oysters! ....man I'm going back to-day!",

    "text": "I always go to hot and juicy to get some fresh or even frozen crawfish. Today my boyfriend and I decided to go have lunch here. I ordered 1lb of crawfish as usual. My crawfish were overcooked, it was all smoochy in other words they were nasty.  My boyfriend ordered shrimp with the hot and juicy seasoning with the spice level being spicy. He also ordered extra sauce as usual. When his food was given to him his shrimp were not spicy at all . The extra sauce looked like grease with garlic bits at the bottom and it was just warm not even hot . We stirred it to see if it would turn out like the sauce that we usually get but it didn't. I went to the bar and I told the girl that was there that the sauce that they had gave me didn't look like sauce. She then said you have to stir it , I told her I had stirred it before but it didn't work. She took it to the back supposedly to ask why the sauce looked like that . She came back and said that the sauce was made out of butter and that's how it should look . Not Very Satisfied I went back to my table and told my boyfriend wat they had said . The girl that was helping us passed by our table and I asked her about the sauce I told her that that didn't look like  the sauce that we usually get and she said we must of ordered something different Before, I  said no then I asked if they had changed the recipes she said no , so I said this sauce looks different from the other times that I had came to eat here she then said \"they made it different today , they have changed the recipe\" REALLY?  she just had said they had NOT changed it  , but Whatever . today will be my last day eating here . Doesn't come close to the hot and juicy in Hollywood !",

They serve everything from clams to crawfish to crab legs and chicken wings.  Each entree can be served with a combination of different sauces like garlic butter, hot n juicy, Cajun, lemon pepper, etc.  Additionally, each sauce can be served mild, medium, hot, extra hot, etc.  I thought the sauces lacked a little of the flavor that I'm used to.  If you are craving seafood in the West Valley, its a definitely a good option...actually its probably the best option conveniently located at West Gate.  Check it out!",

You must be there to keep yourself in line which I think is annoying because now I have to wait. So to kill time, my family and I walked around Westgate until they texted us saying our table was ready. It was super busy but our server was attentive and friendly, making sure to check up on us. My little sister spilled soda and about 3 ladies came over to help clean, so I applaud them for that. We ordered a lot of crawfish, shrimp, Po Boys (chicken nuggets, wings, and chicken tenders one for the kids), fries, and a dozen oysters. Many of the crawfish were soft shell but I have to say the sauce/juice was good. Oysters are good as well, I think if they washed it a bit more then I would've enjoyed them more. Overall, I like it here.",

The only downfall was that we requested the heater to be turned on and it never happened, nor did anyone notify/apologize to us about it. Getting the check took longer than getting our food.

I wish I had a restaurant, I would totally hire him!  Be careful with the spice level here though.. mild is pretty spicy, I might get baby next time. I always forget what i get lol.",

My server was so much better. She got my order correct. The food is delicious. I loved the freshness and the spice. Too bad I had to come twice to be served once. On my way out, I spoke to the manager. The manager was not happy to hear what I had to say. This is a MUST try.",

There was a team lead Shelby and another server punching away at the terminals. Neither one looked up to greet me or say they would be with me in a minute. Waited 8.25 minutes. Shelby finally asked if she could help me. I said I need to order for takeout. She proceeded to tell me she was punched out already and would find me someone. She walked into the area by the bar. Said a couple things to other staff.  No one came to ask me for my order. After 3.5 more minutes. I flagged a staff member down and loudly stated I needed to order. I finally got my order in...

I kept asking for drink refills and had to wait 10 minutes after asking. Asked for butter to calm our food never recieved it.

    "text": "Such a disappointing service tonight. It's almost as if every time I come in, my service is never right. The last few times I've placed my orders for pick up and I've never had to deal with any service issues but tonight my best friend brought me in for my birthday.   It was Sunday evening around 4:30pm. It didn't look busy and they were only seating one side of the room. However they told us it would be a 15 min wait. I got a text message 5 mins later saying our table was ready. YAY! Once we were seated we saw new drink menus. I decided to try their new Craw on Mary drink and we placed an order for a pound and a half of shrimp.   After that our server never stayed the same throughout the night. We finished our shrimp bags pretty quick. (First meal of the day) and wanted to order more food. The service picked up since we arrived and there was probably 15 tables total.   I seen servers and managers running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Seemed as if they were overwhelmed with the dinner rush being there was also a line waiting outside the door. However, there seemed to be plenty of servers AND managers running around. With that said, it was still hard to get service. We had to flag someone down just to place another order and for drink refills. One manager came to pour my friend some water and spilled some on the table, smh!   Another manager had taken our second order and started running away except we weren't even done ordering..  After we were through with dinner we once again had to flag someone down for our bill and it took even longer for someone to come grab our book. My friend got so irritated she brought the bill up to the desk and the lady behind the counter says rudely, \"are you ready to pay?\" We weren't asked how everything was and there was no apology given for the wait.   This place has been open for sometime now. I don't understand the lack in customer service every time I dine in!",

At times your waiting knowing you shed for something like more bread or another# of seafood, but they completely forgot it.

The only constructive advice I have is that they could use a teamwork approach, as our server often got busy, yet many other servers would walk right by completely ignore our needs. Empty water, out if napkins/paper towel, things like that. It's nice when other server step in as needed.  The food was very tasty. We had the shrimp, and crab. Loved the garlic flavored sauce.

After reading the history of this restaurant on their website, I can say with confidence that Vegas is not the place to learn about crawfish. Nothing in Vegas is real. It's all imitation. Unfortunately, this restaurant follows suit. Crawfish should be boiled live and dumped on the table with new potatoes and corn mixed in. Charging additional for those items is petty. I give the flavor good marks, but I understand what others meant about the service. Our server was very friendly, but somewhat slow. I think it is because the servers pool their tips, so individual effort is not necessarily rewarded.  If the restaurant is not terribly busy, it's definitely worth stopping in and giving it a try. If you are familiar with crawfish from the south, be prepared to pay extra for sides, tell them what kind of spice level you want and try to interpret what sauce you want. That's right, I said sauce with crawfish.",

Also, I order the oysters or blue crab here sometimes. Delicious! The only thing i dont like about this place is they mess up my order sometimes. But other than that, i still come here because of the food.",

I had the lobster, which comes swimming in a pool of garlic butter and spices inside a plastic bag.  I had to wear their (provided) plastic gloves, which became so slippery in the \"butter bath\" that I couldn't hold the nutcracker to open the lobster.  My husband, however, loves their food.  He gets clams and mussels, loves the taste, loves the whole experience.  The messy, slippery, spicy part just isn't for me.  I'm sure we'll go back and I'll try the fried shrimp, one of the few items available without the \"bag and gloves\".",

To top it off my drinks where late and the service was terrible.  This place is ran by incompetent people and when asked where on the menu you could not split an order, there was no place on the menu to support their charges.

Good thing he looked at it first before he starts to eat it. Another that is upsetting is they still charged our friend. It was shocking to see a battery on your food.

Nothing about this place is better than Angry Crab. Not the shrimp, the sausages were tiny and not very tasty. The Softshell crab and the calimary were the saltiest things we have every tasted. We couldn't even finish them. The sauces are not hot even when we asked for spicy.  The drink orders got messed up at least 5x during the meal. The server girl had no clue or interest in what she was doing.  If you want good food of this type stick with Angry Crab. This place is all over the place.",

He was asked to bring the beer with the food and did the opposite. I asked for lemon and salt and pepper, I had to go an get it.

There are plenty of parking lots, but it can be busy when there's an event or game night.   When we came it was busy, they said it will be 45 min wait. We gave the hostess our cell num so that they'll text us when the table is ready. While we wait for the table, we decided to walk to the Yard House for a drink of beer and chit chat to kill time.  After we finish our drink, we received the text so we walk back to hot n juicy. Got seated and Leo was our server. Leo was friendly and energetic even when it's only an hour till closing time.   We ordered a pound of shrimps with heads on, a couple or corns and sausages, a dozen oysters and cajun fries. We pick spicy and it was just the right amount of spicy level. The shrimps, corns and sausages comes in the same bag and we just have to wear the gloves and the bib they provided for us and just dig in. I feel everytime I go here, the sauce and the spiciness has been very consistent, and the oysters is very sweet and refreshing! Sometimes I notice the service is not consistent everytime but I love the food here and Leo is great. He doesn't rush us and he let us take our time to order and he always come around to check on us see if we need anything else before the kitchen close.   This is the place to go for some delicious messy seafood!",

It had barely any flavor and hadn't been cleaned! I dont know about anybody else, but as soon as I see the pop trail still in my shrimp- meal OVER. So we sent those back and I was done with this place that time.  We decided to give it another try because frankly, it's close and there aren't many seafood restaurants in the area. This time was great. I stuck to the crab (I was not going there with the shrimp again) and it was good. We both ordered hot n juicy flavoring and I got mine medium spicy. It wasnt spicy at all, so next time I will got hotter. But, the seasoning was good and we were stuffed by the time we left. I would definitely go back again, but I will never do the shrimp again.",

So you know how sometimes you don't want to eat shrimp with the skin and head in public because you're afraid you might be judged?! (lol). Do not be worried here. Their shrimp comes with the head and skin. It's simply the best as it holds all the flavor!!   They have different seasonings:   Louisiana  Juicy Cajun  Garlic Butter  Lemon Pepper  Hot n Juicy and their spice levels are: Baby Spice  Mild  Medium  Spicy  Extra Spicy.   My brother recommended juicy Cajun in spicy so that's what we got. My mom got the garlic butter in medium spice.   Hands downs the Cajun spicy shrimp was the winner for my hubby and me. I'm used to eating  spicy foods and I definitely won't be ordering the extra spicy as the spicy was hot enough for me. Delicious overall!! The shrimp was just cooked to perfection, not too boiled that it tasted mushy but just boiled enough that it was crisp but well cooked.   So they bring your shrimp inside a plastic bag mixed with all the goodies. You put plastic gloves and a plastic bib and you start eating! Nobody judges as everyone is eating the exact same way lol.   We also ordered their sweet potato fries and omg they were so delicious!    We will definitely be visiting this restaurant chain more often :)",

Each order comes with 1 lb. shrimp, 1 lb. crawfish, corn on the cob, potatoes and a dozen andouille sausage pieces. We tried the garlic butter and lemon pepper sauces and both were good.  The seafood tasted fresh as well. I thought this was something different and unique and I can't wait to go back.",

They've had the Hot n Juicy in Las Vegas and said it's just as good considering they're franchised.  As far as food that's not sea food related, it could do better. I wish the menu for alternatives would have been better. The only thing I liked was the cheese sticks and fries.",

It's rare these day to receive great service especially when the place is busy  but Lisette was AWESOME!!!!!!!!  She started as out bartender and the drinks she made were top notch and then we were lucky enough to get Lisette as our server and she ROCKED that too!!!!  She was very pleasant and personable.  She took the time to answer our questions and make suggestions.   This type of service will definitely keep me coming back.  Lisette you deserve a raise and much recognition!!!

Our first visit, as you can see wasn't awesome BUT it was also four years ago... we've been coming here off and on and every visit has been different, not awful but not the best. My husband and I visited this location last Saturday, which you would think \"it's Saturday night, west gate is always busy\" and of course, it was busy! We waited TWO hours to be seated, which they had mentioned when we first checked in. The moment she said two hours I was considering other restaurants, my husband (a stubborn man) had been craving Hot N' Juicy for weeks so I was cooperative. We decided to take a walk since it was obviously going to be a while, the moment we stepped outside, the patio had at least FIVE empty tables and about three in the small indoor section they have on the side.. We obviously came to the conclusion that they were short staffed. Finally, we were seated, ordered the moment we sat down and the wait for our food was not long, thankfully. Our waitress was awesome, but she checked on us ONCE  because she was so so so busy!!! I'm disappointed because we love their food so much but we walk in never knowing what to expect. If it was a holiday, I would be more considerate... it was just a Saturday night.",

I was the one who had to say hi and tell her that I was looking to dine in. And then she asked me for my number and name, I gave her my information and she didn't say anything to me she just turned her back. We waited over an hour. When she finally called us, I got up and expected her to tell me that my table was ready or something along those lines. But she literally just stood there with a blank stare and didn't say anything!!! I was the one who told her that she just called my party and then she said \"oh\" with an attitude and rolled her eyes.    The waitress who took our order was very nice and helpful.  Our food arrived pretty fast. However we did not have any utensils, condiments, gloves, bibs or trash bin.  We waited for about 10 minutes for a server to come back but she never did. I had to go look for our server but I didn't find her I asked another employee if she could help us out and she did. They took forever to gives us our check.  The restroom was incredibly disgusting. There was water and toilet paper all over the floor. They didn't have any soap.  The food was really good however the customer service sucks.",

I've been here many times before. It's a fun atmosphere and you can get messy with the food without getting judged! I've always had good service working here. Never had a problem. I love getting the crawfish or shrimp with the garlic butter sauce. A pound of crawfish is $12.99 and a pound of shrimp is $13.99. I normally get either 2lbs for myself. I recently got into their delicious oysters. They oyster either come in 6 or 12. It's super refreshing and I highly recommend getting it. I have to admit it's a little pricey but it's worth it! Definitely one of my favorite places if I'm in the mood for crawfish!",

My love for Hot & Juicy started in Las Vegas and then I found gold when they opened a location in Tempe. This location in Glendale has good service but consistently makes the sauces much differently than the one in tempe & vegas if you've tried it. Today I had 2 pounds of lemon pepper snow crab legs ( medium ) and the sauce has twice a much grease as it normally has, to the point you have to vigorously stir to get any hints of lemon pepper. I've tried this location so many times and it continues to be off. We also had fried shrimp that were AMAZING, we tried the pork skins and they were okay. Our server spilled our water while delivering our order but did offer to purchase as a beverage for the inconvenience. I love hot and juicy and I wish this location would get the sauces right!",

Food can sometimes be slow(never has it came out wrong)  2. Food comes out at weird times, since different things take shorter or longer to cook rarely does it all come out at the same time. So for people who complain about this go to Angry Crab or their other locations. It's part of the deal.   3. The reason for the 4 stars. Service is a crap shoot and it's not like I demand a lot. Usually when I go, I ask for Maddie and things are awesome. Most of the rest of the staff is forgettable. I truly miss some of their staff from when they first opened. But thankfully Maddie is there and know how to rock things!!!!",

I decided to visit this one Saturday and it was the worst I've ever had. The customer service is terrible. I ordered two pounds of shrimp with corn and potatoes TO GO. First, my order was missing the potatoes. Then my food taste like it been sitting for hours!!! My bag had no gloves, no apron, no napkins, no silverware... no lemons. Nothing. I ended up having to throw the whole bag of food away because it tasted so terrible!!! A complete waste of my money!!! I called this place 5 times to tell them about their service and each time the phone either wasn't answered or off the hook. Oh not to mention I didn't see not one employee in the kitchen with gloves or hairnets preparing the sauce cups. This food and rushed service is probably making a lot of people sick. I won't be back here.",

    "text": "I went in on Thursday evening with a friend, since I was excited about the place... We got a bunch of food (a pound of crawfish, a pound of king crab, and a 1/2 pound of shrimp, with some extra sausage, potato and corn)... The service was HORRIBLE! I've never seen such a disorganized restaurant! We were sat outside, right by the door, where their 'hostess stand' was... We ordered drinks from one girl... Then she came back to check on us, but we hadn't decided yet... We decided, then had to wait about 5 minutes before another gal came out and took our order... Then about 5 minutes after that, another server came out and asked if we had put in our order... Ok, cool. One part of our food comes out, we start eating... then the next, which was crab legs, but no cracker for them... We got one of them (a different one, again) and asked them for one. They said that they were being washed and it would be just a minute (ok, cool... they should be back in a minute or two with them)... 5 minutes pass, and we ask another one for the crackers so we can eat the crab before it's cold and get the same story (being washed, be just a minute). I KNOW for a fact... it does not take that long to use the automatic washer or a 3 compartment sink to wash those damn things.... THIRD time to ask for them, SAME RESPONSE! Are you kidding me??? Finally we get it and then we get the last part of our meal, the shrimp... Then finally after that the cracker for the crab comes by... And yes, by then... it's luke warm. Considering that was the most expensive part of the meal (and only 2 crab legs for 24.99), I was unhappy... We got checked on, I think once after that... that's fine, I don't really like being pestered while I'm eating. Now, the check... We had to FIND someone to get us our check... then, once we gave the payment... We waited about 5 minutes, wondering where the change was... Then we asked someone, they asked someone else, and then that person came out and asked who we gave it to.... Ummm? You lost our money? Really.... Finally they come back with the change. Whew! We get up to leave and much quicker than anything that happened that night, the first gal that served us was out there grabbing the folder with tip... she OPENED it too look at the tip and scowled... now, that, my friends is UNPROFESSIONAL. We left $10 on a $50 bill... Had I been the one leaving the tip, it would have been less, but my friend is much nicer than me. Get your stuff together. Now food wise, delicious... Crawfish were a bit over cooked, but good nonetheless... We had those in the hot n juicy sauce, mild. King Crab, probably would have been better if we could have eaten it while it was actually hot... We had that in the Juicy Cajun, Spicy. The shrimp were in Garlic Butter, mild... That sauce was tasteless, it was watery, and not buttery at all. Very disappointed on that to say the least. The shrimp were cooked decently though and when dipped into the other sauces, at least got some better flavor.",

I called to report it, but as you may already know, there phone just rings and rings and no one ever answers so I took a chance to email the manager and I actually did get a response back within about 1-3 days asking for more information and a copy of my receipt, which I sent, and I never heard back. As if they don't care that they are serving food that cause people to get sick. I've eaten here multiple times and this time it caused me to feel terrible. The fact that they don't care says a lot about the managing team. They still charge the same, but cut down on the portions, the sauce is not as thick as it used to be, it seems watered down and very thin. Bye, bye Hot & Juicy!!!! Hello Angry Crab.  Update: After posting this review I did hear back from the manager, who apologized for my bad experience and reimbursed my brother and I.",

However: the second time around was a completely different story. The biggest flaw I noticed this time of the infamous Hot N Juicy establishment was no so much their servers, waitresses, nor the quality of the food. It is their communication. My goodness I ordered 2lbs of crayfish and 1lb of snow crab legs and it literally took half an hour JUST for the snow crabs to come out. Actually, one of the other table's waitress initially gave our crab legs to a nearby table. Then our waiter came over and had to take it to our table while the waitress walked away oblivious to the situation. And on the crawfish, it never even came out. Customers that walked in after us already had their full orders and ready to pay the bill while my table was still waiting for a simple order of crawfish. We cancelled the order and was displeased. It seems the servers do not communicate with one another since we never got our crawfish and it seems the cooks were having a party in the back since the orders took forever.",

The girl explained to us that since we ordered em at the same time, they're gonna come at the same time. WHAT IS THAT??? Appetizer is supposed to come first that's why it's called an Appetizer!!

First,  let's talk about the drinks.....if you want a few cocktails definitely visit sine of the other bars at Westgate.  The beer was ok, but the Margarita and lemon drop were a total waste.....and I mean they weren't even half finished when we left and we usually don't leave liquor. I didn't try the catfish,  but my buddy ate only one piece and threw the rest out, so I definitely didn't want to try it.  The shrimp was good,  but plucking the heads off and trying to get the vains out was getting tiresome.  Although we did have a good time and the staff were very friendly, we won't be going back.

A different waitress came out of nowhere and tried to give us the bill before we even received the other order. LOL. Long story short, I wouldn't go here again or would recommend anyone.

I would highly recommend that they provide a bucket when Yorker crabs or shrimp as it's super messy. I thought it was just me but noticed the same with everyone else  The sauce has a good flavor and there are many variations however it doesn't have that \"fresh taste\" it's more like a pre-made sauce that's added to the broil/bag.  They don't include corn or potatoes with your order, it's all a la carte. I think they should at least have one of each included.  Service was ok however it was pretty slow even though it wasn't full.  Would I go back? Yes but I would ask for less sauce in the bag.  TIP: Do NOT let that sauce go all over your fingers unless you wanna smell like you have a job peeling garlic all day.",

    "text": "Straight up seafood shack. I love seafood and I love spicy food and Hot n Juicy has both! And yes, you WILL get messy. Fair warning that if you don't like any of those things, this place is not for you and you can stop reading...  For those of you still with us, here's the word: Went in with family (3 kids plus grandma and me) on a Tuesday around 6, there were 4 or 5 other tables seated and the place isn't very big.   THE BAD (Why this is 4 stars instead of 5) Crawfish, unfortunately since it is the namesake, were disappointing. As noted by others, they border on microscopic and it was clear once I cracked the first one that they had NOT been purged prior to cooking. The \"butter\", which costs extra a la carte (50 cents a serving) is not real butter but some kind of almost butterish flavored oil, similar to what one might get on their popcorn at a movie theatre. Ick. Don't bother with it. Shrimp were slightly overcooked.  Now, on to THE GOOD - Everything else!!! We ordered all our seafood with the HnJ special seasoning, medium level which was perfect to add just enough heat but not overpower the crab and shrimp. Snow crab legs: big and meaty, far more so than what I have gotten at other places (Joe's Crab Shack for example), perfectly cooked and delivered piping hot! Oysters: I did not have the issues that other reviewers have. Ours were fresh, tasty, and BIG! Shrimp: again, big and tasty. Cocktail sauce: seems to be made with their special seasoning. It's unusual, but very good and has nice kick. Went well with both the oysters and shrimp. Calamari, Cajun fries, and andouille sausage were all excellent. THE SERVICE: Beyond a doubt, the best I've been taken care of, anywhere. Our server, Irene, was top notch. Checked on us continually, explained all the menu options with aplomb, brought everything we asked for quickly, drinks never empty. Couldn't ask for more. When I told her I wasn't happy with the crawfish, the manager, Heather, promptly addressed my concerns, apologized, removed them from our bill, and comped us a second basket of those oh so yummy fries.   Bottom line: a great place overall to get your seafood fix!! I get that service can get confused on Friday or Saturday night, but that's any casual restaurant during a rush. Lighten up Francis.....",

Let me tell you - I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. SERIOUSLY. I'd rather take them on a bit of drive to the Angry Crab shack in Peoria. Their food has higher quality AND I'm more than willing to pay the price for that quality. Here? Pft, I'm paying for stomach ache!   As soon as I started peeling the crawfish, the meat inside the shell just fell apart. I stopped eating the crawfish after my first one and just ate the shrimp instead. I'm actually lucky that I got away with mild nausea whereas my hubby got a stomach upset about 20min after that meal.   We ordered 2lb of shrimp, 2 of clams and 2 of crawfish - 1.5lb of clams were all shells. The meat fell out somewhere in cooking process. The crawfish must've been frozen for a while already before it even got cooked. AND not to mention that all of us were still hungry after paying for all that food. It was just pathetic and NOT WORTH IT. Go to Angry Crab instead if you can drive a bit further.",

The service has not always been that great long wait time and some bad waiters but the food has been so amazing we continue to come back. Well that has changed this location has decided to delude there sauce anyone reading this beware! The raise there prices and are giving you watered down sauce. Tonight prior to ordering I asked the waitress to please ensure my sauce is thicker as last time we visited we were told the cooks were still learning and we had to wait for a new batch. I was assured today the senior cook was there and I would get my order correct. Well that is not what happen the sent someone to my table to tell me it is what is and if you want my manager she will advise the same. I was appalled and asked to speak to the manager anyway. I told Maggie listen we have been a long time customer and you can't tell me this sauce is good. Maggie informed me not only has store been making it wrong but so has Tempe that the sauce in front of me is what it should be like runny and no flavor just some red watered down sauce. That was it no I apologize let me make this right. It even gets better. I ask for her mangers card as I want to make a complaint and I get a blue sticky note with a number. Well I did call no answer but what do you expect it was a blue sticky note. It's unfortunate I truly was one of there biggest fans but now will be one of there biggest complainers. I have already made a complaint with corporate and will hope this is not what they stand for as a corporate restaurant.",

What I look for when I eat at establishments like this is the flavoring they use. I like a strong full flavor, here, it doesn't give me that full flavor I'm looking for. I would still recommend trying it out for yourself but I've had better flavor at other establishments. The service was top notch, quick to accommodate and quick to refill.

Received my bag of \"mild\" lemon pepper crab legs without the potatoes or corn that I ordered.  I informed the server the items were missing and asked her to verify that I received mild sauce because it was pretty spicy and requested some butter. She finally returned with the potatoes and corn 15 minutes later when I literally had 3 legs left and still no butter.  I told her I was almost finished and she asked if I still wanted the butter and I said yes.  20 minutes later I asked her if she forgot the butter and she said they were backed up in the kitchen and she wasn't allowed in there.  SERIOUSLY!!!  Now the icing on the NOT so sweet cake for the night is when I walked out and forgot my phone.  I immediately returned within 5 minutes and amazingly no one knew where the phone was.  When dialing the phone from the restaurant's phone my Fitbit was in Bluetooth distance and picked up the call.  So they insisted it was in the trash.  One of the male employees took the bag of trash and spread it on the entire patio and still no phone.  Went back in and dialed the number again and now it's not registering on my Fitbit.  Hmmm, then amazingly someone comes out of the kitchen with the phone saying \"we found it in the trash back here\". She was wiping the phone with a paper towel and I noticed there was nothing on the paper towel or the phone.  Interesting how the phone ended up in the trash all the way back there so quickly.",

Service, that Hot n Juicy sauce [I'll be tasting and smelling of this for a couple of days], and even the decor are all the same.  They even send in the same pretty lady to all their stores to help gets things off the ground given by what she has said at their Tempe grand opening.  Anyways, I pretty much always order the same items:  Hot N Juicy crawfish, lemon pepper shrimp, a basket of their cajun fries, and their oysters.  Their oysters are always a gamble though since you can never tell when they're fresh until you actually bite into one.  After the past few hit-and-misses, I think I'll pass on their oysters from now on.  They are currently serving frozen crawfishes as it's not in season so I say hold off until summer if you can.  If not, they're still big and plump but nothing beats fresh crawfishes.  This is such a great and prime location for Hot n Juicy!  Now the west valley folk can get their fill of seafood and the Tempe location can be all mine... MINE!  Best of luck to HnJ!",

    "text": "We went for the first time to this particular restaurant Wh with family to have some crawfish and crab legs. My review reflects more on the service, than it does the food. The food we all agreed was about 4/5 stars. It was all flavored well and the flavor options were outstanding. When we first arrived a young lady came to our table and said \"I will be helping your server Alex, as he is running a little bit behind this evening.\" She took our drink order, and drinks were out in two minutes, zero complaints so far. She took our order at this time, was very knowledgeable about the menu etc. Again our food was served fairly quickly and it was steamy hot! This is where things got unfortunately irritating. We needed more napkins at the table, one of our party wanted to request sauce, and two of our three orders of corn were missing. Our waiter was no where to be found. After waiting about 8 minutes we had to ask someone for our server. Another several minutes later he showed up and eventually got back to our table with the requested items. Again, we hadn't been checked on for several minutes and the toddler in our party was ready to get up and move.... I decided to take her out front so others could continue to dine peacefully. After walking with her for about 20 minutes, I realized they were still sitting inside. I went in and the waiter had brought the check over about 8-10 minutes prior to me coming back in to see if they were ready to go, however Alex never came back to the table to take the card and process the payment. I had to walk the restaurant to find him and ask him to go to our table  to take and process our payment since we had been waiting an unreasonable amount of time. As I asked him to go to the table he says \"Oh, I know, I've got it.\" He walked to a different table and then I pointed to our table which we walked over to and retrieved our payment. I walked back outside again. It took another 6 minutes for him to get us a box for left overs, and finally we were done. We mentioned to the hostess at the door that had the young man paid attention to our table he would have made a better tip. We typical tip on the LOW side of 20% and depending on service, friendliness etc we will occasionally tip up to 40% to 50%. The service was pretty lousy once Alex took over our table. It takes a lot of  disappearing \"effort\" for someone to only earn a 10% tip from my husband. Hopefully someone will work with the staff to re-train and work on service oriented waiting. We would love to go back, as we enjoyed the food. The service the second half of our dinner, just generally lacked in every way.",

BF & I shared a pound of shrimp & asked for it to be mild since I don't like spicy at all. Waited for another 30 mins to get our order only to find that our server accidentally put our order wrong on the level of spiciness. She immediately apologized and so again we waited for another 15mins. When we finally got our shrimp, we realized we also never got the side of rice we ordered. Apparently the server also forgot to put that order down. The only thing I can say she got right that night was the sweet potato fries lol. Food was ok.. seasoning was pretty good on the shrimp and sweet potato fries were great, but I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",

It was $50 for a 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, 1lb crab and a small basket of calamari. There were 2 of us and we left still hungry.  The seasoning on the food was great but, next time when we wanna spend 70 dollars on a meal we are going somewhere where the seafood is already prepared and de-shelled. The service was mediocre. Nothing special.   All in all again it was a good experience but not worth the money and probably will not be back.",

Asked for extra Cajun seasoning on the side. The waitress informed me they could not give me any because it was a secret recipe and they were afraid someone would steel it and walked off. I asked a second waitress who insisted to take my fresh cracklings back to the kitchen so they could apply their super secret rub. I thought it was kind of odd. None of the waitresses were able to tell me much about their food other than what's written on the menu.   The second time I came in at 1835 on a Tuesday evening. Asked to be seated in the patio. Hostess rudely told me that he patio was closed since they didn't have a server out there. Just a quick observation there were about 3:1 employees vs. customers in the main dining room. They didn't look short staffed. I'm sure they could have had a waitress walk a few extra feet to the patio on a beautiful Arizona evening.   I guess another open establishment would much rather have my 100 bucks that evening. I hope corporate would give their staff of ditsy girls better training since they are the face of the business to the general public.",

    "text": "Okay so I live in New Orleans, and even I still prefer Hot N Juicy over any seafood place I've tried in Nola. This place is absolutely delicious and a wonderful experience for your whole family! Be prepared to get messy, even though they do give you gloves and a bib! Mostly everything is served family style, where you can order your seafood by the 1/2 or full pound, and choose the flavor and level of spice. We usually order a few pounds of shrimp, a pound of mussels, an order of catfish and an order of calamari to share among 6 people! They're supposedly famous for their crawfish which is their logo, but personally I prefer the shrimp which is way easier to shell, and way more worth it since you get about 4x as much meat in each piece. Their catfish also comes with fries that you can upgrade to Cajun flavor, and they also have delicious sweet potato fries! We usually spend around $15 per person once you break it down, which isn't too bad for the variety of seafood and the fun experience of it! My favorite flavor combo is the garlic butter mild, and don't forget to add some corn on the cobs that they'll cook right in with your seafood! They come out in plastic bags and you eat straight on the table so you'll have an absolute mess afterwards so don't be alarmed, but it's worth it and is an absolute favorite of almost all our relatives visiting from out of town!",

Well, the crawfish I got were about half bait size (2 - 2 1/2\") to field size (3- 3 1/2\"). There was one large crawfish in the whole bag. I also noted the there were approximately 6 that I could tell were previously dead ( tail meat fell apart, carapace crushed). I don't know about you but my definition of fresh crawfish is alive and kicking. I'll be back as I like the spices, just not for the crawfish. Oh, and they can't tell the difference between the mild spice and garlic butter seasoning.  Edit: the crawfish that I ordered were not purged or cleaned very well either.",

    "text": "I personally believe Hot N Juicy deserves a higher rating on Yelp. I have eaten at many similar places in Northern California, such as Kickin Crab, Boiling Crab, & Crawdaddy. Even though the quality of Hot N Juicy is not on the same caliber, it is a good alternative for AZ.   We ordered the Hot N Juicy sauce with medium spice. I can't really eat spicy, but medium was surprisingly the right amount of heat. The sauce was flavorful, but very salty as expected for these types of food. I think a tad more garlic would have been perfect. For the two of us, we had 1 lb of black mussels, clams, and shrimps in addition to 2 corns. It was unfortunate that they ran out of green mussels, and only had frozen crawfish. I highly recommend not getting the frozen crawfish. It's worth waiting for fresh crawfish - yes, there's a big difference. The cajun fries were bomb - super crispy. Towards the end, I started to have a running nose as the spice finally caught up to me. The food tastes a lot better than Angry Crab. The clams were also significantly larger. However, I like the ambiance from Angry Crab a little more than Hot N Juicy.   There's plenty seating with TVs all around. We went on a Monday night, so service was great. They provided us with gloves, so our hands wouldn't get super sticky and smelly afterwards. They could improve on actively refilling our water. It would also be nice to have buckets at the table to toss our garbage, which will certainly leave more table space. I was running out of room.   I had an enjoyable experience and will definitely return for more.",

    "text": "Eating seafood with my bare hands has never sounded like a better idea. We ordered shrimp, crawfish, crab, and mussels. I had no idea there were so many animals in the ocean.  We started with appetizers of fries and calamari, the latter of which did not have much and was $11 to top it off. Despite the poor start I was in a good mood because it was still bright outside. Nothing is worse than looking out the window and realizing the sun sets at 5pm.  The waitress asked what level of spice we wanted and we said medium, which turned out to be almost more than we could handle. They definitely tend to be on the hotter side, and I'm not just talking about the waitresses. If you have congested sinuses I would still recommend Nasonex.  The snow crab legs were delicious, but I'm starting to feel a bit guilty. I don't think the crab will be able to get around very well without his legs. I've seen enough Deadliest Catch to know that being a crustacean is hard enough. Best of luck to you Mr. Crab _______  Just like Boiling Crab back home! Pricing is fair and service is good. The food won't quite fill you up but if you're up for a messy meal you won't be disappointed.  Allen",

I'm East Coast and you need to steam and smother shrimp in Old Bay. I didn't smell old bay when I walked in, so I was sure they don't use it. So I opted for the Crab. I got it Cajun - Spicy. They will talk you out of spicy, but if you can eat a Jalapeno then you will be fine.  Food comes out in a bucket, and a steam bag. I dug in, and the crab tasted delicious. What I didn't know and what set this dinner into orbit was take a hunk of meat and slam it into the bottom of the steam bag where the juices are....FLAVOR BOMB!!.  I quickly poured out the butter dish, and poured in the juice from the bag. Corn was over boiled, but I don't eat corn, just sampled some from my awesome girl friends plate. Bread was good, sampled that too! I'm not a carb eater, so don't take my word for it. Everything had flavor and it was awesome.   I'm coming back for Bike Night, and will get 2 pounds steamed shrimp, and I'll bring my own Old Bay.  Good job Hot n Juicy.",

One person didnt receive their food. We asked several time and ended up cancelling it as we were all finished eating. The manager came over - ehh- not overly concerned with the experience in my opinion. Offered it for free yet based on the rest of our food he decided to pass. Food was blah.

    "text": "I am not a huge fan of seafood (aside from fish), but I decided to try this place out. There was a wait time, but shorter then the estimated wait time given for a party of two. They take your phone number (cell), and that's how they inform you that your table is ready; which is a great ideal, so you can walk around the area while you wait.  Once seated, a menu with short selections are given to you. If you have never eaten here before, the waitress/waiter will explain how the menu works (selections) I.e. what comes with what.  We decided on two pounds of crawfish, and a pound of shrimp. The seasoning we opted for was the hot n juicy special which is a combination of all of their seasonings. The spice level, we opted for was spicy. Never eaten crawfish before, we had to YouTube on how to eat it, lets just say it was an experience! The shrimp, I didn't realize it was going to be the whole shrimp Lol, but I had better luck figuring out how to eat it!. I recommend dipping the \"meat\" in the juices the seafood is cooked in.  They offer a bib, I would advise putting it on, as things could get messy really quick. The Margarita I ordered was really salty, meaning salt was at the bottom of my cup as well as the rim, which really was a thumbs down considering I never requested salt at all.  Will I be back to eat here again, probably not, as the food was okay. The service we received from our waiter & waitress was great!!   #ilovegoodfood",

The server that brought our check & to go containers was great, although she wasn't our server. I think her name may have been Lis. I've been a server in the past for many years & have never given my guest as poor service as Isaac did. He spoke poorly of the restaurant and how \"the bar sucked\" so he was unable to make any drinks other than what was on the drink menu. For what I spent on dinner I felt Isaac was far less than deserving of a tip & had the receipt not been printed under him I would've tipped Lis. I did not tip Isaac for his extreme lack of service. I won't be back here due to the poor service. I'd be willing to try another location.",

We never waited for refills, they explained to us first timers how to eat crawfish. Our good came out pretty quickly, and they got our order right. 100% percent satisfied and definitely worth every penny. Thank you guys for a great experience.  Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to go again.",

    "text": "After seeing mixed reviews of hot n' juicy we were skeptical to try it out for the first, plus we had a friend in town from Japan and didn't want to ruin her trip but we decided to give it a go, here's my review hope it helps First I want to say the food here is fantastic! Better than angry crab. This is my first time here and I was not too impressed in the beginning. I came here with two other friends and we all had issues with our orders coming out incomplete.  My order was- 1 pound of snow crab with an ear of corn when the crab came out I was missing my corn.  I also ordered a pound of shrimp with an ear of corn and a dozen sausage. The sausage was missing from my bag. Similar issues with my friends. When we brought this to the attention of the food runner Alex; she seemed unapologetic and did not care. As if we were bothering her to correct our order. After her many eye rolls and sighs we asked her to get our server Karen who was awesome and quickly tried to rectify the situation by bringing her team lead Maddie over to correct our situation. She even went above and beyond to provide us a discount. We were not going to ask for a discount or expect one just wanted the order correct because everything was so great. Due to Maddie's great service I rate the overall experience a 5 star",

I'm pretty easy since being a server in my younger day and I always tip.  We celebrated a surprise birthday party for a close friend (20 of us) land our experience was a total let down. Expensive, which we knew ahead of time - you can't get any seasoning for the chicken, not even a side of it.  Chicken is served as plain only. You can only have up to 3 checks no matter how big your party is and the service is poor..   I'd rate it a 0 if I could.",

Not only did our food come out at different times, they brought out the wrong food, appetizer came out in the middle of the Neal and my friends food never came out at all. The waitress didnt seem concerned until we asked for it to be taken off the bill and then the mgr finally got involved. Then when the bill came it included the food that we didnt order. Will never go back.",

After I was seated & the waitress served my drink (promptly, I will add) it was 42 minutes before I saw her again. I asked why it was taking so long, and she couldn't give me an answer. She left & came back with my food about 10 minutes later. The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but the calamari was burnt & inedible. If you are looking for crappy food that's expensive & uses your lunch hour, this is the perfect place for you. As for me, there are way too many dependable lunch options around for me to come back to this one.",

However I order the corn fritters 10 minutes before we even placed our order and they came with the meal even though I  requested we get them first also it took me about an hour and a half to eat the crab because this place had no knives or forks I asked for a knife and a fork and they brought me a plastic knife and a plastic fork give me a break I don't think I should have to bring my own utensils.  So needless to say I won't be going back that did it for me.",

    "text": "We arrive with great expectations,  westgate has a seafood place! Cajun on top of that.  We order a catfish basket and a soft shell crab along with corn. The corn is listed as an appetizer but we asked it be brought with food. It arrives in a little cup soaking in a substance that may or may not be pure cooking oil. After about 45 minutes we ask if the food is being shipped from the ocean.  My catfish basket arrives. I have to share as the crab has yet to be delivered.   We wait about 10 minutes then ask about the crab. He checks on it and a short time later we have a steaming basket of chicken wings! WTF!  I ask to see the manager. She comes and tries to explain how things are cooked fresh and some take longer than others. So I ask if that means if we ordered four things if that means we have a four course meal since they will come about about 20 or morw minutes apart. She said that was correct. So if you go everyone should order the same so you can enjoy it together. Open the catfish, mostly raw. Crab was tasty. Will not be back!",

We were constantly asked how our food was, did anyone get our drinks, has anyone gotten our orders. We went on a Friday night and there wasn't a wait at all, we were seated right away and served immediately. I ordered 1lb of shrimp along with sweet potato fries and a cup of rice. The rice was a little hard and cold, but the sweet potato fries and hotnjuicy sauce on the shrimps were delicious. I would suggest they should add some more garlic to their hotnjuicy sauce though.",

The staff always has attitude, seems like they get mad when you ask for additional orders or refills, they always take forever to provide refills I have to get up and go to them and request additional thing that my family needs. I was there yesterday and had my mom and grandma waiting for us already seated with a table it was a family get together my grandma is allergic to shrimp so I bought her Canes and took it in the restaurant when I sat down with my two brothers the waitress came and said \"no outside food can't be in the restaurant\" I said \"this is not the first time we eat here and buy Canes for grandma, we all are gonna purchase our food here it's just her that she can't eat seafood\" and she said no sorry you would have to leave. I asked her if I could eat outside and she went to check with her supervisor, she came back and said no sorry you can't eat outside food in the restaurant you would have to leave! I felt so unwelcome and not only that she waited standing by the table for us to completely leave the restaurant. It was not the first time we got something else to eat for my grandma we never got asked to leave with out outside food. Been a loyal customer to Hoy N Juice Crawfish since I was living in Las Vegas and because of the poor customer service and attitude from their serves they lost a customer that used to go to their restaurant at least 4 times a month! And I will make sure to spread the word in social media and to the BBB. Negative 5 starts to their customer service and their attitude. I would understand if she approached to us differently but she mistreated us and made us feel unwelcome!",

Not whole soft shell crab, just the crab legs. Womp womp . 10 mins later the crawfish came. They were 16/20's (16-20 crawfish per lb) We ordered Louisiana style and juicy Cajun flavoring. La style was just as expected.... Hot! Cajun was a degree less. Both good.  One potato and one half ear of corn with 2 pounds seemed a bit skimpy but all in all 4 beers 2 lbs of mudbugs and 1 side of crab 'fins' = $50 was not a bad value. Verdict: being from NOLA crawfish in the desert doesn't come easily.  Other than the wait the food was aok!  We'll be back!",
