    "text": "First of all YOU CAN GET GOURMET PIZZA, BEER AND WINE IN THE DRIVE THRU!!!  That alone gets them some stars in my book!!!   The staff have always been good.. Even when I was with a group of NINE eight year-old boys, our waitress had the patience of a saint.  The people eating there are usually pretty friendly - more than what you normally find randomly dining  - just lots of super chill folks there... My theory is that the place is so good, it puts guests in a good mood so everyone is happy and friendly.  Or maybe it just makes me feel so happy that I see it all that way, either way... a good experience all around.    My favorites here:  The \"At Last\", \"The Answer\" and \"Sweet Potato\" Pizzas - all very unique and unlike your average pizza joint.  AMAZING!  Oh, and I hate brussel sprouts but the way they make them, they are actually good to me - so I am no longer a \"brussel sprouts hater\"",

    "text": "Friday night, the wife was out of town. I settled upon Federal Pizza as our reliable standby, Spinato's, is not up to par in their new location--even for takeout.  I called in an order for the Brussels Sprout pizza. At 7:45 the order taker said it would be ready at 8:15. I was starving but figured I'd live. And figured with their, highly touted, super-duper takeout drivethrough (an old bank teller window or somesuch), my dwell time for pickup would be optimized. Boy, was I wrong.   I arrived precisely at 8:15--not because I am neurotic but because we happen to live about 120 seconds from the restaurant. I was second in line. I figured that was ok because, if there is a bit of inaccuracy in their scheduling, I would be sure to have to wait no longer than it took me to get to the window.   As it turns out, the server walked down the line to see who was there. She took my name and returned in a couple of minutes to say that my pizza was \"not quite ready yet\". Bad sign. Well, I moved up to first place and was able to observe a restaurant that did not seem particularly crowded (as many of the Upward Project sycophants have gravitated to the adjacent Joyride which, by-the-way, means a \"stolen\" ride. But that's another story).  I was able to partly pass the time taking care of as paying and tipping (in advance of delivery which, observed after the fact, should have raised a bit of hair on the back of my neck).  Perched at the drive-through door, I was subjected to a roller coaster of hunger pangs as servers kept scurrying around with mine repeatedly going back to the kitchen to check on my pie. My concern growing by the moment as she repeatedly returned empty handed. I think to myself (mind you it is almost 10 minutes late now. They must not have even started my pizza until I arrived): \"What is going on here? Are things so out of control in this dedicated pizza restaurant that they can't control their production line?\" But I assuaged myself that, with one of those fancy 700 degree pizza ovens (after all, Pizzeria Bianco can fully cook 12\" pizzas in 10 minutes) that mine would be just fine. Wrong.  My server finally arrived with the box and proudly thrust it into my hands with a selfsame look of satisfaction. Probably a look borne of being glad to see me finally go than than being proud that Federal Pizza has served another valued customer a work of art.  I should have realized, the moment the box hit my hand, that something was terribly wrong. But I though to myself (justified I guess) that the box was barely warm because the pizza had not been in it long enough to warm it. That the server had grabbed it so quickly in her zeal to sate my hunger that the heat had not penetrated the carton. As I sped off into the dark with visions of enjoying a Doc Martin episode with my near stellar pizza (with plate in preheated oven) at 8:30.  Arrived home, cracked a nice cold beer, and opened the box. Lo. It was barely cooked. The crust was pale and sallow. The ingredients barely lukewarm. The parmesan shaving not even wilted. This presentation spoke volumes. The brussels sprouts were cooked, but not hot. This exposed the fact that the ingredients are \"precooked\". Now, I guess that is something you have to do to get pizza out the door in ten minutes. But I don't know how many people are going to come back for that kind of delivery!",

The sibling restaurant to Postino/Churn finally figured out the beer scene with some decent draft choices and the option of keeping the party going at home with growlers and chubs.  The wine coolers were delicious - moreso I found with a straw, but that might be personal preference.  Strawberry Rhubarb is my favorite (so far).   The pizza is great - in the same vein as Humble Pie and Cibo - but better.  In Phoenix, I think only The Parlor could be better.  But when I'm jonesing for a meatball pizza, I'm headed to Federal.  Cozy/swanky interior, sweet little patio outside.    I read about the Corn Coins so we checked them out, but the Mister Mister was better.  Corn is corn.  Corn with cheese is corn with cheese.  Delicious, but not groundbreaking.    Our new go-to for sure!!  It's our new go-to restaurant.",

They had a great beer list as well as homemade wine coolers.  I had the blueberry hibiscus and it a perfect concoction.  The margherita pizza was delicious.  They were not stingy with the cheese or the basil.  My husband had the sweet potato and ricotta pizza.  He quite enjoyed it and considering he's not the biggest pizza fan, that's kind of a big deal.  We shared the 'Lil Triple for dessert and it was wonderful as well.  Oreo crust, chocolate creme and toasted marshmallow...    Service was a teensy bit slow but to be fair, they were quite busy.  It was a beautiful day outside but we opted to sit inside as the patio was quite loud since it's on the street.    I realized shortly after being seated that this must be the brainchild of the same folks who run Windsor and I was correct.  (I think the gum wrappers in the sugar containers may have given it away.)    Can't wait to go back!",

The interior is charming, as with all of the Upward Project restaurant designs. We are very excited to have another wonderful neighborhood restaurant.   Drive through lane: If you call in your order, you can pull in to pick it up via the drive through lane. Very happy with this, as you don't have to get out of your car (like at Postino's), given it is a majority valet parking.   Staff: Staff is awesome and friendly.  Pizza: To date, we have tried the Big Star Pizza (a family favorite); Also one with prosciutto and dates (my personal favorite); and one with meatballs (our least favorite). Pizza dough was a tad doughy, otherwise it is fantastic.  Dessert: Must try the chocolate mouse with the oreo crust and home made marshmellows on top. My only complaint is that they can't make it up to go via drive through :(",

    "text": "It was already 9 pm on a Sunday night.  Just yelped for a pizza place and found this place that I'd never heard of before. The name didn't sound anything special. So, our expectation was nothing more than a average Joe's pizza.  When we entered found it quite elegant looking with a nice mellow music. Ali, our server, was most accommodative. Although it was only 45 minutes to close, she never hurried or pushed us for placing a quick order. She took time to explain the menu and even moved us to another table when the one we're sitting at was getting too much of a chilly breeze.   My children ordered Veggie Lasagna.  Picked \"Sweet Potato pizza\" for my in-laws and \"At Last\" for us. I also requested a side salad called \"Great Little Salad\" and a glass of Four Peaks Sunbru for myself.  Food was served in less than 20 minutes. Children thought it was the best Lasagna they ever had! My in-laws, who never really enjoy the pizza just loved the texture and taste of their brick oven baked pizza with Sweet potato topping and light sprinkles of Ricotta cheese.  \"At Last\" pizza was superb with basil and sage toppings nicely arranged over fine goat cheese.My side salad was so fresh and crunchy that I promised myself to get a full plate next time!  This place gives you a fine dining experience at a real average price.  Being a frugal foodie I just love it.",

Excellent job with decor and coziness. Outdoor eating is an option with warmers when it gets chilly.   Had the pizza with artichoke and also the pizza with pepperoni. The kids loved the pepperoni it had a great flavor. The Brussels sprout pizza was great but you really need to like the flavor of Brussels sprouts...which I do, so marvelous! Another great touch when the kids asked for Parmesan cheese they brought out fresh Parmesan and grated it over the pizza. So yummy!  The servers were very attentive and worked well as a team. My glass or my kids glasses were never empty. So well that I was not sure who exactly was my assigned server. I loved that!",

Unique salt & pepper shakers at each table, a long bar, open-sided booths, and an open kitchen. Plus, there is a drive-thru pick-up window.   We ordered the fig & prosciutto, the margarita, and the corn & green chili pizza. While I think I actually like Humble Pie's pizzas better (they're both of the same wood-fired style, but Humple Pie's flavors are richer and there isn't as much crust), these pies were tasty. Lots of toppings and fresh ingredients. They go light on the cheese, but that's okay. Makes you feel less guilty about eating half of an entire pizza.  The best part of the meal, though? The wine coolers. These aren't some Seabreeze or Boonsfarm stuff. These are fantastically flavored, bubbly, and refreshing coolers. And at $5 for a bottle full, they're a screaming deal.  (All their beer pitchers, wine coolers, and glasses of wine are $5 before 5 PM, FYI.)  I did see some of the pasta and salad dishes folks ordered, and they looked pretty darn tasty.  Needless to say, I'll be back.",

When we asked our waitress if the music could be turned down she had ask us what we said because she couldn't hear us. (The answer was... I will ask but the owner usually won't let us....)Hard to believe its the same ownership as Windsor and Postinos!!",

This restaurant group is amazeballs to begin with (Postino Wine Cafe, Windsor, Churn and a taco joint in the works) and Federal Pizza is another bright star shining in their sky.  The prices are reasonable for this wave of artisan pizza that we are all drowning in, but in my mind so, so worth every penny.  Perfectly thin and crispy crust with delicately distributed toppings and gooey, melty cheese battle for control of your tastebuds in a war where everyone wins. We've tried the sweet potato pizza and brussel sprout pizza and both were unique and taste-tastic.   The service is always top notch and I definitely recommend the fried polenta as an appetizer. Get over the hipster crowd and maybe-too-loud music and enjoy the damn good food.",

We went during the week and it was semi-busy but we sat at the Pizza bar in front of the kitchen.  The guys in the kitchen were really nice and super talkative which was an added addition.  We ordered the Meatball pizza and the Cesar salad to share.  The salads are a big portion so you can share or have as an entree by itself.  The pizzas are also big enough to share.  The dough had a really good crisp texture and the toppings (cheese, sauce and meatballs) were really fresh and flavorful.  I cannot wait to come back and try some other items on the menu.  I have to agree that the waiters were not overly friendly, they were not rude but didn't go the extra mile to be friendly.  The guys in the kitchen rock though!",

A quick look in the area and we decided to try Federal Pizza (noticed Federal was near our favorite Postino).  We arrived in casual clothes and although it was a 30 min wait we were seated quickly.  I was starving and we got on our orders of The TLC Salad and a Big Star pizza.  For a first visit we nailed it; the salads was fresh, crisp and flavorful while the pizza was amazingly wonderful crust with fresh ingredients.  The sauce was the only ambiguous part of the meal as it didn't really come through; not that this is a bad thing just that the fresh toppings and the wonderful crust was so overwhelmingly good.  Ms. D enjoyed her Home made cooler and I thought the Primitivo wine wasn't especially great.  But did I mention the crust on the pizza was tasty (LOL).  Parking is a bit weird and while they have complimentary Valet which only allows one way entrance I did not really want to check my car that evening.",

They do have some repugnant, overly hip pizzas on the menu, but the meatball and peppers is our go to.   Service is always good, sometimes great. On point staff. Love the restaurant inside and out.

Best tasting pizza since I was a kid.  The crust is fantastic and the ingredients, the same!  We don't have anything near as good on the east side so we travel to Phoenix.  Try their pizza and you'll throw rocks at pizza anywhere else in the Valley.",

    "text": "This review is *long* over due.   I'm so sorry Federal Pizza, I really am!  You feed me, You love me and then I abandon you.  (Not really, because I come back with my hungry tummy all too often.)  SERVICE The folks that work are wonderful. I am remiss in providing names. Which is horrible. My first visit sold me on this place. The server went above and beyond (so I thought, but that just how they are here) to help a teenager select a drink (non-alcoholic!) that met his palate suitably.   Every (and I sincerely mean that) visit since the level of service has been impeccable. I usually show up later than my table mates and join in the fray of conversation. Even though meals are mid-flight, and drinks have been poured, someone ALWAYS shows up for me. Like magic.  THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF As I haven't had much time to study the menu, I ask for suggestions for wine. With some guidance I have *never* been steered wrong with my choice. A sample is provided and I am happy.   Just roll me over and leave me in my booth please.  Maybe with a pillow and blanket.  SHOUT OUT I did catch one name in my last visit. Rian. He's the shizzle.  I arrived to find he had run over NEXT DOOR to pick up something sweet. Yes, a dessert for my teen friend. (High maintenance that one :) With complete familiarity of the wine menu he provided a wonderful selection for me. Rian totally understood the flexible timing required from our table, and respected it.   A FAVORITE FOOD ITEM When I inquired about the Porchetta Sandwich Rian sighed. Come on kids. When someone is so happy about food - YOU GET IT! (Slow roasted Pork Loin + Pork Belly  + Arugula + Caramelized Onion + LEMON! on Homemade bread.)  (Again, this Rian is the bomb.)  I've been watching what I eat and trying to take portions home. Yeah, not THAT night. But honestly I've never met anything at Federal Pizza that disagreed with me. It's usually the portions that defeat me.  If I lived any closer this could be dangerous.",

I found there was plenty of choices for me to choose from and what I ordered turned out to be DELICIOUS!   To start I had a side of Veggies, which were Balsamic Braised Carrots & Broccolini. They were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The carrots were my favorite!! I would have eaten a few more orders of those had I been wearing elastic waist pants. I made a mental note ;)   My main course was a TLC Salad. It was composed of arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, smoked almonds & fennel with a citrus shallot vinaigrette. I had them hold the pecorino & add chicken. This was one of the most scrumptious salads I've ever had! With every bite there was a different burst of yumminess! The beets (of which I'm a big fan of now) and pear really made this salad. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was not the least bit dry, which I'm always afraid of. I am glad that I added the extra protein because the salad size is not large, so I would have been starvin marvin within an hour without it.   The service was excellent. There's lots of parking in the back. Both booths and tables are available and there was an outdoor seating area that faces Central.   There's also a drive through, which is really uncommon for a non fast-food place, lol. & from what I hear, you can order kegs to go..... ask more about that if you're interested, because I didn't probe for details, I was too busy imagining someone receiving a keg through a car window :D",

    "text": "It's adorable, it's tasty and they have great deals!  Love this place!  FOOD: The pizza crust is lovely!  Ask for some olive oil on the side if you're into dipping.  After several visits with a vegan friend,  I can personally assure you that the At Last and the Sweet Potato taste great vegan-ized.  They pile the veggies on more generously to make up for the missing cheese, which is really nice.  The At Last tastes wonderful with the cheese, as well!    Last night we also tried the tender, tasty Pumpkin Ravioli (without the pancetta, which might make it even better).  It had a lovely, creamy flavor and delicious chunks of  weird veggies (like turnips and rutabaga) on top.  It wasn't too big to finish all by myself.  ATMOSPHERE: The decor is 50s and a little swanky, but the atmosphere is perfectly casual.  There's a TV over the bar so you can catch the D-Backs score, plus cozy booths and a real candle on the table for romance.  The service is top notch - genuinely nice people from hostess to server to the nice lady who kept filling my water.    DEAL: Monday and Tuesday nights, you can get a bottle of wine (or two pitchers of beer) and a pizza for $20.  They'll even cork the wine so you can take it home if you don't polish it off.  I think the pizzas are supposed to be 12 inches but seem bigger to me.  Looking forward to our next meet-up there!",

The host was a very congenial gentleman, who I later found out was working his first day there.  He should be the manager BTW, and treated us so courteously, the place was packed and although he estimated a 20 minute wait, we were seated much faster via a very high tech communications system.(Impressive!!) The bar staff, the wait staff and everyone there treated us as if we were ROYALTY and the food was DELICIOUS, especially the pizza made in a wood burning oven, confirmed by the stacked wood outside the restaurant! The specials are GREAT and I will be back for sure!!!",

    "text": "We visited on a Friday for lunch. We were seated right away. I ordered the \"Double Down\" lunch deal, where I got to choose half a pizza and a half-salad or soup. I ordered the half Casanova and chicken panzanella salad, and an apple spice wine cooler. The drink was delicious, like a really fresh apple cider. I liked the dough of the pizza--good, chewy, with bubbles in the crust, but I have had better. I enjoyed the sweet combination of toppings, and the softness of the hot ricotta was divine. The salad was good but had only two chunks of fresh mozzarella (mind you, those were tasty chunks). My husband had a full meatball pizza, which he liked but didn't think it was the best around. I tried a slice, and I agreed--it wasn't bad by any means, but it didn't have a zing to it, either. He had two Epicenter beers.  The service was an issue, too. Our server was MIA most of the time. All the other servers would pass by, see us looking around, and tend to us. Our server would then show up and see everything was taken care of and go to the opposite side of the dining room again. We were grateful that the rest of the staff was attentive!  We don't go to downtown Phoenix very often and there are a lot of choices there. While we liked Federal Pizza, I doubt we'll make a return visit.",

I don't think I'm too much of a pig, but I didn't really get that much food for what I was paying for.   I did like the beer selection, though. That was very enjoyable.",

    "text": "Tonight (Friday) was our first time to try Federal Pizza. After reading the rave reviews on here, we were excited! That excitement dwindled the minute we were put on a wait.   We sat outside to wait and all of a sudden a brunette bar tender comes storming out of the restaurant with the manager, cussing up a storm. She complained about Chris (I guess another bar tender) for a good 10 minutes - about how he would cuss her out in front of guests, how she was going to leave immediately if the manager didn't send Chris home and more ranting.   After that episode we were seated inside and literally waited TWELVE minutes before we were greeted. Yes it was a Friday night, but they were half full at the time. Being a waitress myself, I was appalled no one had even stopped by.  We ordered the chop salad which is incredibly small for $10.   Honestly - the wait staff really didn't have it together. They seemed completely unorganized. A waitress came up and asked if we wanted to look at a dessert menu and we didn't even have our pizza on the table! Seriously?   The pizza was good - small, but had a nice flavor.   Overall, the service was terrible. Since my husband and I frequent Postino's quite often, I expected much better service. Bartenders - get your shit together.",

I just want to first off say the service was outstanding and basically the word of mouth based on the place being packed has got around in the Phoenix area on Federal Pizza. I went in with my girlfriend the other night and we split an artichoke, salad and one pizza with two waters for a total of 40 dollars. I gave the valet guy 5 bucks and I tipped the waitress 10. After walking out $55 dollars I can't say it was worth it. Don't get me wrong the food was delicious and I don't really like giving bad reviews but it seems a little out of my price range.",

For me, Federal Pizza is my favorite pizza in Arizona (okay it's a tie with Bills Pizza in Prescott). But this particular pizza-that probably sounds strange-works. The sharp cheese and hint of lemon is delicious. I am obsessed with this pizza, so much so it's hard for me to order anything else. I've even tried recreating it at home! Hands down, this pizza with fluffy crust is so amazing.   Okay so maybe you hate Brussels sprouts, I get it. But all Federal Pizza is good pizza. I recommend the meatball pizza-I love it because the meatballs aren't giant globes atop the pizza, they slice them so you get them in every bite. I also recommend their house made wine coolers which pairs unique flavors like blood orange and cardamom. Fun fact: Federal got its name because it used to be a bank.",

Our waiter was superb, showing patience and a model of friendliness and courtesy! Now, lets get to the good stuff...food! We started with the vegetable appetizer (F&A Veg Board) and enjoyed all of it! The potatoes with the dipping sauce were particularly tasty! The pizza was every bit as good as our appetizer! We ordered the \"Manifesto\" pizza, which is unusual for me as I don't normally go for goat cheese, but this one was very good! Not too strong and blended very nicely with the other ingredients! I also liked how they use Schreiner's sausage, which is a local place! Gotta support where you live by choosing small business, and that is just another reason I really like Federal Pizza!

Last night was exceptional.  We had a bit of an issue with our Brussel sprouts and not only did Larry sincerely apologize, he also made it up to us in a big way without our asking.  At least 2-3 people waited on us and kept our drinks fresh and let us stay as long as we wanted, even though the place started getting busy, (we were using a large space).  The food never disappoints, I had spaghetti and meatballs and the arancini which was just divine.  The gluten free crust was perfect!  The Brussel sprouts were amazing and the apple cobbler, out of this world!",

The Marg was good- could've used a bit more basil and little less EVOO. The At Last was...interesting. The basil and lemon zest is what drew me in, but I didn't taste much of it. The corn and broccolini were interesting additions, not bad, but peculiar. Overall, i was not impressed with the At Last. Sounded better than it tasted, sad to say.  They have a pasta dish that I'd love to try. They also have wonderful specials at specific times of day that id love to come back for. The pizza was good, but I've had better...  Oh, how can I forget! We also had the crispy polenta fries. Those were pretty bomb, and the romesco sauce was a perfect pairing.  I'm excited to come back and try more. Love the ambiance, friendly servers, and happy customers.",

Built a wall with my spoons and tried to eat it. They noticed and gave me a new salad (to go with the pizza I ordered) and told me they took it off...but they took it off and re charged it. I should have just had them remake it from the beginning so my fault but this amount of ranch was criminal lol",

It's a pretty fantastic deal, if you ask me. We got started with a pitcher of the oatmeal stout and an order of F&A veg board. This was a pretty good start. The Romesco sauce it came with was pretty great and so was the beer. I was waiting eagerly to put in my order of the pepperoni pizza and I asked for mozzarella as a topping. Such a bummer that the pizza was a let down!! I have heard some really amazing things about the food here and I was secretly hoping that I would like their pizza more than Grimaldi's but it didn't even come close. We were hesitant to order dessert but ended up getting one anyway. In hindsight, we could've totally skipped it. We placed an order for doughnut holes and they were served with a side of chocolate sauce. The doughnut holes were alright but they were laden with sugar. So much so that I had to brush some off before eating. And the chocolate sauce was burnt :/ Not the best experience for me but it might have been an off-night in the kitchen. I left with a slightly bitter taste in my mouth.. literally!",

Someone told me to stop being a pouty brat. (I can't use the exact words that were said to me because this is a family website.)  Service at Federal Pizza is a cut above all pizza joints. They treat customers like they're dining at a classy establishment. We got our glasses repeatedly refilled, dirty dishes promptly cleared away, and all the staff were aware of our table.  The F&A veggie board was good (I would def order again), the salad was good (would def reorder) and the polenta was good (would reorder). The romesco sauce was fantastic. Where has it been all my life? The pizza was so-so.  From the pictures on Yelp, I was hesitant to try the pizza because I didn't think I would like the crust. But crust tasted okay and the pizza was saucy. The downside: the crust is weak and requires some attention getting it off the tray without spilling off the toppings, there was very little cheese, the toppings were overly sweet.   So most likely I will probably not reorder pizza. But I was happy with the veggie selections and FP is a good place to be.",

We also ordered a half sweet potato and half brussel sprouts pizza which also didn't disappoint. I would choose the brussel sprouts over the sweet potato, but it was nice to try something new besides pepperoni and sausage. For dessert, you have to order to bombolini. They are amazing!  The only downside is limited parking and wait time, but both are worth it. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",

The waiters use a \"team effort\" approach, everyone watches and helps every table, there is no specific server for each area. Pizza and salads use quality ingredients, always taste fresh. The Brussels sprout pizza is my favorite. Try the lunch/salad combo for around $12; it's the perfect amount for lunch.",

Plus their pricing is reasonable.  Not until our last experience did I realize how above and beyond this place is.  My husband and I placed a carry-out order.  We drove up, got our food, and left. As soon as we got home, I noticed I had a missed call. It was Federal - they had forgotten to give us part of our order, and we hadn't even noticed.  They asked if it would be possible to come back by. We came back, got our food, a big apology, and a voucher for a free meal for our next visit.   Best pizza place in Phoenix for sure.",

I have had about every pizza they offer and all are great!  I feel the Big Star will appease anyone but there are also some pizzas that are very unique and mix a variety of ingredients.  The salads are filling and awesome!  What I like the most is the service - one time we received a pizza where there was a hole in the middle and the issue was addressed and we were comped for the mistake.  Lastly, Federal Pizza offers a great beer selection and you can't beat the happy hour pricing - $5 small pitchers.  If there is one flaw, its the happy hour times - it only goes until 5pm. I wish the happy hour went till 6 or 7.  Its also great for families and kids.  Keep it up Federal! Love ya!",

Service was good and food was brought out in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. While my wife enjoyed it, I found it to be way too salty. The pepperoni and the pizza sauce were both too salty for my taste. My wife enjoyed one of their signature 'wine coolers' and the prices on everything was just okay. Overall, they have the location, the atmosphere and the employees - now all they need to do is put the same amount of effort in the food.   Incidentally, when the waiter asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese with the pizza, we expected him to come back with a shaker. Instead he has a cheese grater and cheese and starts grating it over the whole pizza. (My wife wanted parmeson, not me). So that was an unexpected and unnecessary surprise. Best to leave the Parmesan with the customer in case they want more later and can put on as much as they want. This makes more sense with a pasta dish...",

At first I was bemoaning it but then I figured it's better than waiting 4 hours at Pizzeria Bianco. I went for the burrata--which I could have just sustained myself on that. The house-made soft cheese was the perfect texture and not too salty. The scoop they give is plenty split between 3-4 people with the accompanying crostinis. I tried two different pizzas: one with mushroom and Schreiner's sausage, the other was \"The Casanova\" _ prosciutto, dates, ricotta and arugula. I never thought of dates on pizza but I'm a believer. The dates' sweetness combined with the prosciutto is almost heaven-sent. I liked that much better and would fight off anyone who tried to take my share. I know it may be kind of sucky that their pizzas are only available in one size. But hey, that means you get leftovers of some really fantastic pizza.  The vibe is definitely a cross of hipster and white-collar work crowd. Valet parking is the only option since the surrounding streets do not allow parking. Blah. Hoping the next time I go, it will be on my bike. Also, if it's packed, it may be hard to hear people if you're seated inside.",

    "text": "This was my very first visit to an \"Upward Concepts\" restaurant.  I was very much looking forward to my visit to Federal Pizza due to the numerous recommendations that I'd gotten from friends.  I am quite possibly one of the easiest people in the world to please, which is why it pains me to share my experience.  This visit happened the day before New Years Eve...  We arrived at the restaurant to \"complimentary\" but required valet service.  Why, oh why, do these folks force you to valet your vehicle?  There seems to be ample parking since Aiello's has since gone out of business.  There is nothing more foolish than walking out of a restaurant, handing some kid your claim ticket only to be forced to wait for your car which is well within spitting distance.  SUGGESTION: Let me park my own car... \"complimentary\" but required valet service does not equate added value.  We were well prepared for a lengthy wait.  After all, this place just opened up a few short months ago and seems to be the \"it\" place.  PROPS: They had beverage service available while you wait!!  Once we were seated, my attention was immediately drawn to the table of animals that had been dining for some time.  I don't often use the term \"animals\" to refer to a table full of children, but stick with me as I think you'll agree.  Picture it... five parents enjoying beer and wine while the five children were seated at the opposite end of the table left to terrorize the patrons.  We're talking feet on the table, banging on the windows, slapping/punching each other and yelling just to name a few of the behaviors.  It must have been some pretty good beer/wine because the parents opted to allow it all to continue.  Enter the owners of Federal... they approach the table and are introduced to some of the folks dining.  They have a friendly exchange and walk off.  Never addressing the out of control children!  SUGGESTION: It's ok to approach someone and tell them they need to monitor their children... after all what's the worst that will happen?  You lose them as a customer?  I'd rather lose them as a customer versus all the people that had to put up with the parents' negligence.  Somewhere in between the screaming children and the hostess that seemed to yawn non-stop we managed to get our order in: Porchetta Sandwich (as an appetizer), Cesar salad (as an appetizer), Pepperoni Pizza and a Big Star Pizza (asked for the pizza to be \"crispy\").  When the food was finally delivered the Porchetta Sandwich was flavorless and mostly mouthfuls of pork fat.  The cesar salad seemed to have way more than it's fair share of anchiove.  It was so fishy that it was inedible.  SUGGESTION: Taste your food.  The pizzas came to the table burnt beyond recognition on half the pizza... a clear indication that they were not turned (as any good wood fired pizza is) in the oven.  We asked to give some feedback to the manager.  I will not use her name but will tell you that she was a young attractive blonde.  Clearly our server had taken it upon himself to tell her that we asked for our pizzas to be WELL DONE, which if you'll recall from earlier we said \"crispy\".  She proceeded to make an attempt at telling us in her own polite way that it was our fault because we ordered them well done.  After I made it known that I was onto her and her tone, she truly seemed to be interested in getting some good feedback from us.  After chatting she offered to comp our entire meal.  It was VERY NICE of her to offer to do that!!  If you are reading this... thanks for turning the conversation around and creating a more pleasant tone, it was appreciated.  We will give it a second chance for sure... here's to hoping that visit turns out better than this one!",

    "text": "Appetizer was really good(Mister Mister).  Pizza was good.  The beer selection was OK.  The waitress was just OK.  I wanted to complete an art project so I had called in ahead of time with a special request and was told I could be accomodated.  After trying to order, I found out they did not have all of the necessary items(I needed 1\" pepperoni and green peppers - they only had large pepperoni and red and yellow peppers).  A chef came out and advised that he would do a special order if I emailed the details.  I never heard back from the email.  Pretty disappointing as I was excited to complete my art project.  Overall it was good though.  I don't know if I will go back, I wish the chef would have replied even if he couldn't help.  - update I came back for another visit October 2015.  This time the pizza was not good at all.  Service was not good or bad.  The menu was changed also.  Don't think I will be back.",

The house salad is delicious -- simple with a tasty dressing.  They have yummy appetizers -- corn coins and olives are my favorite.   It's fun to sit at the pizza bar and watch the folks cook too.  They have a decent booze selection as well.",

    "text": "What a great place! Just checked it out for happy hour on Friday afternoon and was most pleasantly surprised. They have nice booths in the middle and a very casual vibe and atmosphere. You can watch the dough boys making wood fired pizza and order beer to go in a growler which is actually quite reasonable and the equivalent of buying a 6 pack. They also have a nice wine list, but didn't have the wine we wanted, Dos Cabeza, on tap so we settled for some Pinot Noir.  One thing that is very cutting edge is that there is no assigned server to your table, instead all the waitstaff pitches in and gets you what you need, wethere it's refills or ordering more food. I asked if they pool their tips and they do I much prefer this style of service as it's very fast and much better than flagging down your waiter which in America people get an attitude about. That's one thing they could work on though is attitude, it seems almost a bit too hipsterish and when we mentioned Red Lobster to this waitress she looked at us like we were crazy. Too bad, I guess that's just a human trait. Overall I give this place 4 stars for atmosphere and food.",

We sat at the bar since it was too hot to enjoy the patio.  We split the 4 Cheese Pizza with a cheese blend and sauce.  So yummy and I love the thin crust.  I ordered the Great Little Salad and even ate the beets.  I have tried the Margherita Pizza and Caeser is a great combination.   I recommend the Mister Mister as an appetizer.  Lightly fried veggies and mozzarella with delicious Green Goddess.  The Blackberry Rosemary Wine Cooler is great on any day.  The staff are amazing and very attentive. I will have to try the Sweet Potato or Casanova pizza on my next visit.",

We stopped by for a late dinner and were greeted with a nice selection of craft brews and delicious food options. The staff was friendly and laid back and had a good knowledge of both the beer and the food. We settled on the simplest of pizzas they serve but were blown away by how good it was with juicy tomatoes and light crust. Sadly, we live in San Diego but will know where to go when we come back to Phoenix!",

I was very disappointed and not really in the mood for a hipster pizza joint but it must have been fate since it was there that I found my new love: wine coolers!  I know what you are thinking: \"wine coolers? As in those sickly sweet bottles of crap from theeighties!?!\" No, my friends, these are totally different.  Made with fresh fruit pulp and muddled herbs that are strained and then poured over Spanish champagne, they are absolutely delicious. Between the seven of us at the table we tried every flavor and they were all fantastic.  My favorites were the ginger one and the strawberry rhubarb. They were so crisp and refreshing! A ton of flavor but not too sweet. I know we also had some tasty appetizers but now I can't even remember what they were because I was so enamored with the drinks. I guess I will have to come back and try the pizza atsome point.",

    "text": "Last weekend I went to dinner here with a friend and his two boys. We had pizzas, meatballs and the chopped salad along with their local brews.   We had the best service. Everyone was so attentive, the boys who are pretty picky eaters, ate all their four cheese pizzas. We ordered a combo pizza and when it was served to us, we were told that they would be bringing us another one because one piece was not touching the end of the pizza pan, we said we didn't think that would affect the taste of the pizza. Didn't matter we got another pizza on the house. Lemonade and water glasses were constantly filled without asking, beer always came out with clean glasses, and dirty dishes were not never left on the table more than a minute or two, can't get any better than that. Our dinner with tip for 4 people was over $100 (we laughed and said who goes out for pizza and beers for $100 bucks), this time it was money well spent! We even played charades at the dinner table for about an hour after we finished eating, the restaurant was busy and there were people waiting for tables and not once did anyone ask us \"to give up\" the table.   Great job to all the staff who waited on us last Saturday 1/18/2014 afternoon. We will definitely be back.   Thank you, Thank you, Thank You",

    "text": "My bf and I went to Federal Pizza last night for dinner. I'd wanted to try the place since it opened, but I'm not often in the area around dinnertime. We'd been nearby and decided to hit up Federal and give it a try! I'm so glad we did.  Being a Friday night, I expected the wait would be a while, and the hostess quoted us a wait time of about 45 minutes. We went and sat outside, but the wait probably was no more than 25 which was nice. The ambiance inside is quite loud, so be prepared for the loud (but good!) music and the chatter of all the happy diners. I'd tried their grapefruit-ginger wine cooler at this year's Devoured, so I ordered that to drink, and it was as tasty as I remembered. I'd heard great things about the burrata appetizer, so we ordered that as well. At first, I was a tad bit underwhemled with the burrata, but the more I ate, the more it grew on me. The bread was crispy and slightly charred, with a good smokey flavor, and the burrata was super cold and complemented the bread nicely. It was a little salty for my taste, but with some of the fresh basil added to the cheese and bread, it was mighty delicious. I'd order this again in a heartbeat.  Where pizza is concerned, I was deciding between the brussels sprout pizza, the Gemini (with potatoes and goat cheese, I believe) or the Sweet Potato (sweet potatoes, ricotta ,sage). Let me tell you, I ordered the Sweet Potato and that ricotta cheese was the best I'd ever had in my life. I don't know what brand they use, or if it's made in-house, but damn was it good! The bottom crust was a little thin, but my pizza managed to keep it's integrity and didn't get soggy. The crust as a whole had great chew, was light as air, and had a great char from the wood-fired oven,  My bf went the simple route and ordered a pizza with pepperoni and sausage. The sausage was the best part because it came from Schreiner's, and come on, nothing from Schreiner's is bad. Great flavor! I added a piece of sausage to my sweet potato pizza and the flavors worked really well together.  No room for dessert this time around, but next time I'm definitely ordering the bombolini! My only gripe is that the prices seemed a bit steep for what you get, but I guess it's all their high-quality ingredients.",

Absolutely perfect, tangy, refreshing and damn that was brilliant. I got to try the Strawberry Rhubarb wine cooler and woo, those these are strong and tasty.  It's always a pleasuring dining in here and having Jared as our server! Can't wait to be back for Happy Hour.",

I figured that was a good sign and considered us lucky to grab two seats at the bar. The staff is friendly and the music is FANTASTIC- old school Cyprus Hill, Beastie Boys had us in the right mood.  The menu looked good with so many options that it actually took a while to decide. But in the end, I can't say I was impressed.  - We started with the veg board. Best were the roasted carrots and potatoes. The cauliflower and fennel would have been better with a bit more time in the oven because they were still really al dente with not nearly enough of the golden brown I hoped for in a dish described \"wood roasted\" - Kindly- the server offered to make our pizza half and half. We chose the sweet potato/ricotta/sage and the brussel sprout/pancetta/manchengo/lemon. Both good in theory, but failed in execution. The slices of orange spud and creamy ricotta were both tasty, but toppings were limited to the very center of the pie, leaving at least half of each slice naked and flavorless. There were barely any brussel sprouts on the other side, though the lemon flavor was tasty and something I would try to repeat at home. The crust was a real issue- undercooked and doughy. Just poor execution of an otherwise good idea. - Side salad was fine and priced right.  Overall, happy to leave this place for others who enjoy it more. Though they win the prize on music selection, there are many better pizza options in town.",

    "text": "This place is hopping and has quite the reputation for their pizza so I was excited to give it a whirl. My friend and I decided to find the best pizza places in town over the course of a week (we worked out a lot that week), and Federal Pizza was on our list to try. It was crowded when we came, but we valeted the car and snagged a couple spots at the bar right away, so there was no wait! Sitting at the bar isn't usually my favorite place to be, but it was quite entertaining because we got to watch the guys make the pizza and they gave us the inside scoop on what to order and what to drink.   We decided to order the Casanova pizza, Manifesto pizza, and the Caesar salad. We also indulged in a couple blueberry hibiscus wine coolers. The pizza took a while to come out, but they were very busy and it is nice to know you are getting freshly made pizza straight from the oven. The salad was good, but nothing to write home about, and the drinks were just so so. When the pizza finally did come we dug right in! The Casanova was fantastic; prosciutto, dates, and ricotta go together so well! The manifesto was pretty good, but not our favorite. Overall we enjoyed this trendy pizza spot, but it wasn't the best that we tried that week. For me it is all in the dough, and this dough was lacking that wow flavor that is worthy of 5 stars. If we are in the area and craving pizza we will stop in again, but we both agreed we probably won't go out of our way to come here. The atmosphere is crowded and loud, so picking up pizza to go might be a better way to go.",

I mean, how can you beat that?! We decided on a bottle of still rose, which was recommend to us by our server Nicole. I was damn near starving, so we ordered the meatball trio and OMG so freakin' yummy. There were so many tasty looking options, so I just told our server to pick a salad and a pizza for us. She did not disappoint!!! She brought out the chop salad (a salad with soppressata?! YUM!) and the Casanova (sweet AND savory). We left with full tummies and the service was just so on point! Big thanks to Nicole for rolling the dice for us. This deal is on Mondays and Tuesdays, but our experience was so great, we will go any day of the week!",

Our server was wonderful.  He gave us some really good recommendations, like the pizza.  He recommended the Brussel Sprout Pizza.  OMG.  It was perfection!  I love anything brussel sprouts, but was still was a little skeptical about it.  Now, I would recommend it to anyone.  If you like brussel sprouts and pancetta, this is the pizza for you! You can't beat the $5 dollar pitchers of beer for happy hour.  They do offer happy hours on the weekends on pitchers of beer, coolers and glasses of wine.    I can't wait to come back!",

Both the Casanova and the Brussel Sprouts pizzas were fantastic and unlike any other pizza we'd ever tasted. The Margherita was good as well, but was a taste we all knew very well.  I also love the modern/classy/artistic feel of the restaurant itself. The prices are reasonable and the staff were friendly enough.  It was an overall good experience and we'll definitely be returning.",

Great stop for after-work apps or dinner!  I tried their Chicken Parm which had a unique sauce that made it a new experience for one of my old stand-bys. I tried my friend's Hawaiian pizza and it was thin and full of flavor. Hardly any grease.  Our server was a doll and checked in w/us frequently. On a Friday evening, I only had to wait 10 minutes for a table for 2. I also love that they offer free valet service.  Be prepared for a noisy dining experience - the place was packed and tables/booths are near one another. Try not to get annoyed (like I did initially); let the buzz of the lively patrons give you energy after a long day at work. :)",

Even things I didn't think I would like I've liked. Biggest tip? Always always ALWAYS order the chef's whim... and if you don't know what's on it, don't ask until it's served. This place is incapable of making a bad pizza (or bad anything)! Trust them! And if you have room after pizza, order the little donut things with the chocolate.

There is also taco Tuesday next door at joyride so just avoid everything unless you want to wAit for 45 minutes. Parking sucks and despite there being valet we were turned away to fend for ourselves. So it took in extra 10 minutes to find parking, 30 minutes wait for a table for 2 and there was 2 people ahead of us the whole time.  I was hangry. Good pizza. Good atmosphere. Incredible busy, it's not worth your time to even approach this place on a Tuesday.",

I've been here recently for a few birthday celebrations and the staff really went above and beyond- specifically, for a 5 year old who desperately wanted the staff to sing Happy Birthday to him. And that's exactly what they did. How sweet! Weeks later, for my birthday, we also had a great time with delicious food. The Veggie board is TO DIE FOR. The antipasti platter is also delicious. I've tried many of their pizzas and they have never disappointed. The donuts for dessert? I crave them *all the time*. Now, is this place a good choice for a quick dinner? No. It has always been a rather long visit for me... staff works hard but just give it some extra time and keep that in mind when trying Federal Pizza. If you want it quick- they have a drive thru pick up option!",

I came on a Monday night with a group of friends.  Every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm is pitcher of beer and pizza for ONLY $20....what a deal!  Too bad we came at 6pm haha!  Needless to say, they have a decent selection of local brews.  I ordered a crispy dark lager that night along with some appetizers to start; brussel sprouts and arancini.  The brussel sprouts came well charred and topped with pork belly bacon and sliced almonds.  It was doused with a lemon aioli and came with dipping sauce; it was alright.  My favorite bite of the night had to be the arancini; a fried and breaded risotto ball stuffed with parmesan and mozzarella cheese on a bed of marinara sauce and basil!  The crispy breading with the subtle warm bite of the risotto and cheese melted in your mouth.  I'd be done with this but hey we at Federal \"Pizza\", so have to try out the pizza.    For our pizza we ordered the Pineapple Express.  Topped with prosciutto, pineapples, calabrian, chili and chives; this was a flavorful pizza.  The prosciutto was salty while the pineapples gave it a sweet bite.  I thought it was alright still thinking of the risotto balls haha!  In the end, Federal Pizza definitely has a great deal on a Monday and Tuesday night.  I thought their pizza was doable, but nothing too special.  Coming back for the arancini for sure! - Enjoy!",

Very bland Ceaser salad, one size pizza, which could cause more than 2 people to over or under order, and finally placing paper under the pizza, on top of the pizza pan, collecting grease, and making it difficult to get a slice without a wad of paper, since they never cut the pie all the way through.

Our food came out quick but not overly quick to make us think we were being hustled out for some reason.  The food was delicious and plentiful.  Not enormous portions but just the right amount.  The only negative for me was  the restrooms were co-ed, co-mingled whatever you want to call it.  I don't care for that, when you have two rooms why not keep them separate?

WE had the veggie board, and the sweet potato pizza. Both were great! I loved the food. :) The hostesses didn't seem to be on the same page though. We had one tell us we would be in a booth, and ask if we needed a high-chair, another come after to take us to our seats outside at a table, for 4 (we were a group of 5)  and again, ask us if we needed a high chair.  I will let all that slide since it was their first week. One other suggestion though.... Bike rack! Great location for bikers, but no place to lock up!  Also it seems kinda odd that there is no entrance from the street.   Overall, great food! Can't wait to go back and try some other pizzas!",

The warm service made all the difference when we arrived. Valet was easy, sat out front and were immediately offered drinks under a heater.   Were seated at a quality booth in the back corner. Like most posters say, you do not know who are the servers sometimes, but that is OK. They are nice enough to look you in the eye and ask ya if you need anything. Impressive. John was our server and was one of those servers that are cool cats with a little attitude that chicks eat up. Me, not so much. But the kid did a good job.   Drinks - great beer selection. Mini pitchers are the way to go for sure.   Appetizers - had the Meatball Trio and the Campari Tomatoes. Good stuff!  Pizzas - We split 3. Brussels Sprout - Yeah, that is what I said, There was no left overs. Really good if you like BS. Casanova - Sweet dates with salty prosciutto, makes this a winner! Manifesto - What! yeah it was good. So some reviews say the crust is burnt, but it really reminded me of pizza in Italy. Good pizza.  Dessert - got a free Bombolini. Just was not too sweet and was missing something. It might be homemade, but does not cover that after dinner sweet factor.   Experience -  It is a cool scene, mixed with some 40 somethings and older folks enjoying the large, comfortable space. You get a number of people serving you, which makes for good service. Go with the flow and enjoy.",

It was very busy - seemed to be lots of out of town visitors.  The service was very good and so was the food - my husband had the pizza with pepperoni and I had the mushroom ravioli.  We both took part in their homemade wine coolers - my husband had the strawberry/rhubarb and I had the raspberry/lavender.  Not sweet at all and we got a deal on those too.  They were $5.00 instead of $8.00 - maybe because it was before 5:00????    Just a warning when you go, the building is not marked as Federal Pizza and the entrance is off of the (free!) parking lot behind the building - the entrance is not marked either.  Regardless, give it a try - I'm glad we did and we'll definitely go back!",

Lamb Bolognese at the restaurant would serve three and at $15 it is a delicious meal. Take out, it serves one, maybe two very small portions still at $15. The spaghetti and meatballs was a small portion as well.   If you're going to offer takeout, make it a delight, right? It leaves them more tables to fill up.   Figuring the packaging costs? Well, we can't eat the containers. Ok, that was a bit snarky but I was left with not enough food to serve three people.   Just feel a bit cheated. And you know who else is famous for this?

Chicken parm was burned to a crisp,  completely unedible,  Ceasar salad was drenched in lemon juice, completely unedible  (chicken for salad was good,  came in seperate container) and the pizza,  the whole thing had about a 3 dimes (size wise) of cheese.  We called the restaurant and they said \"take up your concerns with uber eats\".   ZERO customer service or care.  Don't bother with this restaurant, everything from the food to customer service was unbelievably terrible.   Mistakes happen, but the level of not caring about our experience was off the charts unexceptable.",

I could have a Casanova pizza every day and be one happy camper.  But seriously, I've been here multiple times, and each time the food and service has been excellent. I'm not a huge fan of pineapple pizza in general, but I tried their \"Pineapple Express\" for the first time yesterday, and now I've officially found one that I've liked and would even order again.   I've also done takeout and taken advantage of their drive-through (!), which is super convenient and also allows you to avoid the cramped parking lot / valet.",

I heard they also own the Joyride and other neighboring restaurants, I MUST check it out since this place was a hit!   We had a very opposite experience earlier today at Cibo and this place definitely made up for it!  Thank you Federal Pizza and friends that made this evening GREAT. We'll be back!!!! :)",

Everything we've tried has been tasty, but the Casanova Pizza is my all time favorite main on the menu. The only downside is the parking. We've driven downtown a few times and just left to go elsewhere because there is simply nowhere to park on the weekend.   This is a favorite for a girls night out or happy hour, preferably Mon-Thurs.

I didn't have to wait as long for food or anything this time however the bartender seemed uninterested in us at all. I am not a very demanding person, nor was my company however it's nice when you are checked up on and that your drinks are full.

In addition, FP offers a drive thru so you don't have to get out of your car when you order ahead and swing by to pick up your food!  On a recent visit, my family of four had a Federal Chop Salad, an order of Polenta Sticks, a Big Star Pizza, a kids pepperoni pizza and a kids buttered noodles.  It was plenty of food, so we had leftovers the next night.  FP is moderately priced as well.  Insider tip:  check their website for specials -- there are some really good ones!  And join their eposse for some additional sweet deals and freebies on occasion.  Enjoy!",

My boyfriend doesn't eat meat and doesn't like bell peppers.  So the pizza, 1/2 pepperoni and bell peppers, the other 1/2 just cheese.  So she asks \"But you want cheese on the whole thing, right?\".  She was one of those people.  Every once in a while I get one of those.  Where the concept is just too difficult.  Who orders a 1/2 cheese-less pizza?  \"Yeah, we want cheese on the whole thing\"...  So I must've been on the phone with her for 15 mins trying to get it straight.  We're starving and they're the only thing open.  He goes in to get it and there's pepperoni on the whole thing.  He tells them the mixup.  They take it back and said they made it over, but when I got it home it was clear they just picked off the pepperoni.  The cheese was hard and cold.  I was livid.  Nothing was edible.  We trashed the whole thing.  I will never go back to Federal Pizza.",

If I did not feel like one topping or the other they are always happy to accommodate and swap it out for something else. My only complain is that this is the place that makes you want to bury your diet kind of pizza so be warned you will wind up eating way more than you thought.",

The food is fantastic, excellent pastas and pizzas. My fave pizza is the margarita but I do wish it had tomato sauce on it as well because it kinda tastes like just bread and cheese otherwise. This is just personal preference of course, it's still a good pizza. For dessert I've tried 2 of their cobblers, a mixed berry and a peach. Both cobblers were fantastical! OMG, I wish they always had cobbler but I hear it's seasonal so they may be changing things up again soon. They have a great selection of craft beers and in different sizes too! Overall, one of my fave go to restaurants in Phoenix. Oh and I almost forgot, for appetizer you must try their polenta fries, just do it!",

He explained the way they do it and he made it sound so delicious I was sold. Let me say I am so glad I said yes because it was sooooo good! The sauce they put at the bottom was creamy with a spicy hit, the chicken was cooked to perfection.

    "text": "I will start by saying that I am a BIG Upward Projects fan, so I might be a little biased. Windsor and Postino are two of my favorite restaurants, so I was extremely excited to try their new venture - Federal Pizza.  Our waiter was fantastic, recommending selections from each section of the menu. Because it was a work lunch, we didn't sample one of their wine coolers that consist of a house made infusion and sparkling wine, but I WILL be back for happy hour one day to try them out.  The atmosphere is really great - the windows fill the whole place with light and mid-century modern decor is abound. One of the small details I loved is that each table has a different style of salt & pepper shakers, so it was fun to look around and see the fun varieties. Being an Upward Project, the restaurant features cozy & comfy seating as well as a fantastic bar set-up and patio.  For starters we got the corn coins (marinated/cheese covered corn cobs sliced into coins) and they were delicious. Sweet & salty. We also got the baratta and bread and it was also tasty. If I had to chose one, I would get the corn coins since they are not something you see on other menus in town.  We decided to skip salad this trip and split two pizzas - the Casanova (featuring dates, prosciutto and arugula) and the Manifesto (featuring Shriner's sausage, mushrooms, onions and cheese). Both were incredible, and how could they not be on the doughy yet crunchy Michael Coe crust. It's my favorite crust in town now, so look out Parlor!   I already am excited about my next trip there. If you love Windsor and Postino, run, don't walk, to Federal Pizza. You won't be sorry!",

But I feel it is well worth it now. :)  Now for the food, yummmmy! The Burrata is amazing, then we had a chop salad and the margherita pizza with prosciutto. It was all so yummy. This was shared between me, my husband and a friend and we all left very satisfied.   Here is my ONLY STIPULATION. The pizza's are so small for the price. I understand a lot of places are going this \"we use top quality ingredients for our toppings\" however, they did not put enough prosciutto to make me believe it was worth the overall 15 dollar 12\" pizza size. Just my opinion.  Otherwise, atmosphere nice, people friendly and staff pretty friendly too. Just be prepared for the crazy parking!",

I went to Federal Pizza for lunch with my mom today and let me tell you...I was not disappointed in any sense of the word. The vibe is laid back, the layout is open, and the decor is natural and minimalistic while being stylish at the same time. We struggled between sitting at the bar or at a table as we're used to doing bar at Postino and table at Windsor but the booth won.   Our server, Jared, gave us enough time to actually look at the drink menu without leaving us wondering if we had a server which was nice. Settled on the Sean Minor pinot noir which I kind of cheated on because I've had it and it's yummy. Light with just enough flavor.  We decided to get the margherita pizza with prosciutto and arugula on half as well as the spaghetti and meatballs and a side salad for me. The pizza was absolutely delicious...the prosciutto added just enough salt to balance out the arugula covered with lemon dressing and the crust was awesome; not too tough and not too doughy. The spaghetti and meatballs were tasty and the meatballs had a good kick to them. Side salad was pretty basic; mixed greens, beets, and a vinaigrette dressing that was really good.   Service was attentive without being overbearing (I'm a server and I appreciate check ups but not every 5 minutes. I promise I'm a little more laid back than that!). I only wish I had tried the dessert as they all sounded fantastic but this is definitely not the last time I'll be going to Federal so I'm sure I'll make room for it on the next trip.",

It had beets and corn in it..which scared me.  I have never eaten beets before...so i was kind of scared. I went through with my decision...mostly because my wife made it for me. Good thing because the pizza was delicious. Not sure what beets are supposed to taste like...i thought they would be red, they were yellow..and sweet tasting. Is that normal? not sure but the pizza was good.  Anyways...ended the night with my growler in hand...+1 for me.",

Italian food is a difficult food to get right and I'm happy to report that Federal Pizza gets their cuisine right.  Firstly, their pizza is excellent, which is no easy feat. Most pizza joints flub their pizza pie at onset with the sauce, usually too sweet or too spicy. Federal finds a happy medium.  During my visit, I had their Margherita pizza, a white pizza covered with tomato, basil and olive oil. It was delicious.   It was here, in addition to the Federal Salad, I could tell the ingredients used were fresh. The sauce came from fresh tomatoes, as did the tomatoes on top and other toppings.  All of this came at a reasonable price; I dined with two other people and the overall bill amounted to just over $60. That's great dining no matter how you shake it.",

Delicious!  Pizza, sandwiches and pumpkin ravioli...  It was all good!!! The service is outstanding, atmosphere is marvelous... Dining outside is a must...  Especially with our great evening Phoenix weather in late February.... Plus they have several heaters available... Just in case.  Afterwards we went across the street for ice cream at Churns...  (Another must do!). FEDERAL PIZZA is a for sure recommend!!",

Federal's pizza is baked deliciousness.  Unique combinations on each pizza and excellent starters to choose from compliment the menu and my stomach.  Sandwiches are great and all can be washed down with a great selection of draft beer.  My wife prefers the wine coolers which are very tasty I must admit.    Take home a Chub and anything from the menu.  Enjoy discounted drinks before 5pm.  Take your date here for a nice dinner.  Enjoy the outdoor seating and people, car watch with good food and drink.  Any way you choose to do it you should not be disappointed.   Thank you Upward, and my apologies to Windsor and Postino for the transfer of my business for the time present, but we will be back.",

The prices are excellent - ~$12-14 for a pizza that is about right for 2 people. Pitchers of beer for $5, including some craft and local brews. Growlers for $15! The food was delicious. We had a pepperoni pizza and a specialty pizza with fig, arugula, goat cheese, and prosciutto. Both were good, but I really loved the specialty pie (can't remember the name now). The crust is very thin, but chewy instead of crunchy - similar to Bianco in that way. They have many different specialty options, but you can also make your own, mixing any combination of probably 40 different ingredients. Of course they have Schreiner's sausage, since that is all the rage in Phoenix these days. They also have a great patio for sitting outside when the weather is beautiful (like Thanksgiving weekend!). Parking in the lot is not plentiful, but there's typically enough on the neighboring streets.",

Today I had the salad chop, it was good, I can't figure out the dressing but I have no complaints, I'll let them keep their secret.  We had the brussel sprouts with pancetta, a little bit heavy on the lemon but we still ate the entire thing.  The beets with pears was strange, good, but strange, not sure I would order it again.  The wine list is good, I'm particularly fond of the Sivas-Sonoma Cab.   I'll be back, no question there.",

The service has always been great, as well as the atmosphere, but I am not impressed with the food. My first time I ordered the chef's special pizza so I took that into consideration since it was a little more quirky than I prefer but this last time I went basic and was still not impressed. The pepperoni was WAY too salty and completely ruined my pizza. And this is coming from someone who puts salt on everything. Also, the crust is completely flavorless, I think actual air might taste better. Add the veggies and polenta sticks to your Salty McSalty meal and an IV might be required in order to restore your hydration.   Sorry Federal, I really want to love you and your 'walking distance from my home' but we are certainly not friends yet. I have heard the sausage pizza is really good so maybe I will give it another shot but I am pretty sure the crust isn't changing :(",

    "text": "Flash back to about a week ago. My friend invited me to dinner here because she had a coupon and they had a special going on. Double deal (we thought). She raved about the pizza so I was pretty excited... Who doesn't love carb night?! We sit down right away and the waitress flies by and explained the drink specials in a way that didn't make sense to even my friend that had been there before! We wait and wait and finally put our order in. This is the last time we see the waitress for a long time. Some other guy brings out our wine and we quickly realize that the table/sidewalk is slanted and the bottle and are glasses are headed in the direction of the ground. Same guy finally brings out our pizza. Pizza is super soggy and my friend had to ask for ranch 3 times. It was just ok. Disappointing actually with it being so soggy.   Waitress dropped on bill and disappeared for another long period of time. We put out my card and my friends coupon. Waitress says they can't take coupon during a time they offer \"specials\" even though the coupon does not say this at all. She looks at my friend and asks if she just wants to run HER card. Big mistake. Never assume who is paying the bills, especially with her bad attitude. She runs my card still and I asked to speak with the manager about the coupon issue. Waitress says \"I just keep striking out with you guys!\" I respond yes even though her interaction was so minimal it was rather pathetic. This manager could care less about any customer satisfaction. In fact I don't think he cared about the business in general. All I got was a smug look that he got what he wanted. In the end I didn't give the waitress who didn't do anything a tip (which I hate doing).   This was truly a heinous experience.  And with the sheer number of people that talk to me everyday  about where I travel and restaurants I visit I have so far and will continue to tell everyone to avoid this place. Go to Cibo (or Pizza Hut) instead.",

The crowd is of the \"too beautiful for school\" variety you'll find at other Uptown establishments like Windsor, Joyride and Postino.   There's generally very long waits on the weekend. That would be fine if they'd be willing to call you on your cell when your table is ready, but they refuse. Additionally the seating/waiting area on the west side of the building is very limited (even though there's tons of room to add additional benches). So while you wait instead of being able to stroll the lovely and historic Medlock Place neighborhood you have to idle about in a hot parking lot.  Calling customers who are on a 30 minute plus wait would be a very easy thing for Federal to do, and would earn them another star from me.  I do appreciate the building its in, it's great to see an Al Beadle building adaptively reused.",

    "text": "I've been here once and thought it was alright. I only had the pizza and thought it was delicious - it was the crust that made it super yummy as well as their wine coolers, but there was nothing fabulous that would have me coming back all the time. So when I went again, I knew I was in store for yummy pizza but not sure what else.   I, and a friend, went back on a busy night. There were people waiting, even outside on a cold rainy night. While we waited, we managed to find a place at the bar and grabbed a beer. The wait didn't seem long and we were seated at a booth. The service was awesome, which was expected since last time was awesome, regardless of knowing one of the bartenders who took care of my friend and I.   Anyways, we started off our meal with their BOH soup. From my experience, in general, BOH soup is always yummy and worth trying! And their soup was worth trying, although I wish their soup of the night had been a bit spicier, it was good. My friend also had moved on from the beer to the hibiscus wine cooler and it was super yummy. I do need to order that next time.   After the soup, we were going to get two pizzas but decided to try an app and a pizza. Experience from last time told me that two pizzas would not be even close to being finished. The app we went for was the Meatball Trio. I wanted to try it for the polenta, the meatballs we're just bonus. I really liked it! The crunch from the polenta with soft yummy meatballs and their marinara sauce was awesome. And the pizza we had - the Manifesto - was just as awesome! I'm not normally a fan of goat cheese or fennel, but on the pizza, it was delish.   And when we thought we had had enough, we decided on dessert. We got a cobbler. Now I'm not a fan of cobblers or fruit pies, but their cobbler was something I ate up. The crust and fruit filling was awesome and was served hot so eating it with ice cream was a must. I just wish there was another scoop of ice cream since the one scoop melted into the dessert lol.   I will make sure to keep coming back and easy my way through their menu :p",

I haven't eaten here enough to satisfy my curiosity with how they get all of that crunchy goodness into every. single. freaking. bite!  First time I went to Federal Pizza sonny man ate an entire cheese pizza on his own. I mean the kid likes pizza but even I was amazed that he put the whole thing away! I got a single bite of one of his slices... (** disclaimer ** my child is not obese! He's tall and lanky and has the metabolism of an Olympic swimmer)   My mom and I split the Big Star and had a few slices each to take home for the next day. Big Star is all kinds of goodness, olives, mushrooms, bell peppers, more olives, and I don't remember what else. So good! No drinks this time as I was driving home with precious cargo.  The next time I ordered the Manifesto (** I wish they would split the specialty pies. I hope they figure that out soon). This pizza was topped with sausage, mushrooms, feta cheese, and probably some other good stuff I can't recall at the moment. I also ordered the Grapefruit Ginger Cooler, be careful because this is delish and it will, I repeat it will get you buzzin.   There is so, so, so much on the menu that I am killin to try. Uh yeah and I have to get me a growler full of brew to go! Maybe tomorrow for an end of the world jam I'm going to! NTS: get growler.  You know there is something special about the decor here also. Orange booths, raised just a tad. Open view to the kitchen area. Long bar. Groovy chandelier. Amazing patio with red chairs. Love it. Like the rest of the Upward Projects restaurants this is a favourite for me in this city. Lots of hipster vibe with both the staff and the patrons. I dig it.",

    "text": "Maybe I come here too much. For instance, I know that it is exactly 367 steps from my door to Federal's. But the pizza is just so good, it's hard to not want to go everyday! My favorite pizzas are the Big Star and Margarita. The brussel sprouts are also amazing. I went with a group one day, including one small child, and even he liked the brussel sprouts! If that's not a testament to how good they are, I don't know what is.  They also have the same great happy hour as Windsor/Postino, with the addition of house-made wine coolers and beer growlers to go. $15 to buy the growler, but only $10 to get it filled. If you're in the mood for dessert, definitely get the donut holes with chocolate sauce. I'm not a big chocolate person, but I find myself covering the donuts with it.  As much as I like Federal, I have had a couple of disappointments. I tried the ravioli one night and they were very bland. I also got the wedge salad to go, and it seemed like it was mostly \"wedge\" without many toppings.  While there may be some misses at Federal, I will definitely keep coming back for the pizza.",

The atmosphere is very cute, modern and in a great location!   We ordered: Arancini - always a great appetizer, was perfectly fried and full of flavor Meatball Pizza - everything was great, pizza was a little soggy and had to be eaten with fork/knife, but didn't bother us Garganelli Pasta - perfect blend of ingredients and very light  There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try, so I will definitely be back!",

I decided to go back today (yes, for the second time within their first week of business) and try out a few other menu items. I also wanted to check out their patio on such a lovely Sunday afternoon.   I am not disappointed to say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself once again. Our server was Jet (a staple at all Upward Projects restaurants) and he is always on top of his game. I'm glad to see he'll be hanging out at Federal Pizza...that means the staff will be as excellent as what you can find at all of their restaurants. I tried the caprese sandwich this time around and was pleasantly surprised. Pane Bianco may have a competitor here...the mozzarella was super fresh, the basil was fragrant, and the tomatoes were juicy and tangy. Not to mention the deliciously charred bread that was drizzled with olive oil. So tasty! The drinks were as lovely as before and the patio was perfection on a sunny fall day.   So hurry over my fellow Yelpers...I promise you'll enjoy every bite!",

    "text": "A new pizza place in a historic bank building. A Savings and Loan that most likely Charles Keating and the Keating Five put out of business. And to wash down those wood-fired pizzas from Master Baker MJ Coe, small-batch craft beers, custom growlers and fine wine.  It is the work of restaurateurs Craig DeMarco, wife Kris DeMarco, and Lauren and Wyatt Bailey in business as Federal Pizza, Postino and Windsor & Churn.  Here's what we know.  Located in the historic Al Beadle building, which originally housed the First Federal Savings & Loan Bank, which inspired the restaurant's name, Federal Pizza will serve up sharable starters, salads, sandwiches and wood-fired pizzas.  Federal will offer a seasonal and progressive wine list, small-batch craft beer selections, and custom growlers for to-go orders. Keep in mind you can order a pizza at home, drive through, grab the pizza and fill up your growler of two sizes and drive away without anyone seeing you in your supersexy PJ's. A first in Phoenix. Expect this feature in December.  Today I had a chat with Robert and Megan. Two hard working and very pleseant hotties behind the bar. I ordered up a pitcher of Lost Abbey Ale. The signature of this beer has it's beginnings in the Garden of Eden. Those two were told don't drink it. But Adam got her drunk, and well, you know history.  For my sandwich, Porchetta. On a scale of one to ten this sandwich is a $10. and for lunch, this was a delicious meal. I purchased a 64 growler of Lost Abbey for $10 and Five for the Jug.   Everywhere we turn these days, there is a battle being waged between those who make restaurant love and those who make war. I bless thee.",

    "text": "There are pizza joints and there is Federal Pizza. In America pizza is a common food so when I find a place that offers non-tradition type pizzas I consider them awesome. I can't think of enough ways to state how superbly amazing every pizza has been.    Federal Pizza does have your typical supreme or meat pizza but they include additional toppings that will make you go Pavlovian while waiting for the food to arrive.  Some friends invited me there for my second trip to this wonderland recently and again I wasn't disappointed.  Having never before eaten brussel sprouts I was a bit skeptical when my dining companions ordered a pizza with brussel sprouts,pancetta and other amazing toppings.  The first bite was heavenly the combination of favors were exceptional. The crust was just thin enough to not overpower the main event.  I have to thanks my friends for making My first experience with brussel sprouts an outstanding one!  Our second pizza was both visually stunning as well as mouth watering yumminess. The colorful combination of yellow and red peppers offered a nice visual contrast to the mushrooms and onions.  The flavors of the vegetables perfectly complimented the meat topping that accompanied it. While I did pick the mushrooms off because I am not a fan the pizza still was astronomical.   To start the evening we enjoyed a flavor explosion found in the chop salad.  Just the right amount of spring greens, cheese, and salami, not to mention the peppercinis.  Just a hint of salad dressing to top the masterpiece, definitely not overpowering or drenching.    A fun feature to this restaurant is the drive through option. You can place an order to go and pick up a couple of bottles of wine while your at it. Not something you see in your average pizzeria..  The service was phenomenal, I don't believe my water glass was ever completely empty.  The servers were very friendly.",

Very cute decor inside, modern, trendy, but yet casual. They have the same happy hour drink specials as postino with $5 pitchers, glasses of wine, but also offered homemade wine coolers that looked quite interesting and will definitely try next time. They offer very unique pizza combinations from broccolini with goat cheese and roasted corn to Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. (Range from $11-14) We opted for their lunch special which was a great deal. It comes with a half size pizza (full size is good for one person) and also half a salad of your choice. I went for the big star (schreiners sausage, peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, and their cheese blend) very tasty! And half the TLC salad (pear,apple, pecorino, citrus shallot vinegarette) awesome once again. All that for $9.99 was well worth it!  We still had room for dessert and tried the bombellinis (fried sugar doughnuts with chocolate dipping sauce) soooo perfect!!! Don't pass those up! Service was great. Although it was pretty empty anyway. The server was extremely helpful, kind, and upbeat :) hopefully it's the same when it's more busy.  Will definitely be back again probably during happy hour to try those wine coolers, more pizza, and those bombellinis!  Make me the happiest girl and bring this one to Gilbert too, Upward Projects!!!!!! :)",

    "text": "The wine coolers! Oh, YUM. If Federal Pizza let you order the wine coolers via take-out, I would be in big trouble.   Don't really like overly dark restaurants, so I've opted to order out, which can be tricky. Their pizza combinations and flavors are good, but the crust doesn't always hold up for take-out. It should be a bit crispier to accommodate for pizzas with heavier toppings like meats and sauces but since you won't have trouble holding back, just make sure to pick it up right when they tell you to so it won't sit overly long. If you're dining in, the crust probably isn't that big of an issue.  I recommend the The Answer (with sausage, apples, fennel, candied... pecans, I think, gorgonzola, and spinach) and Sweet Potato (sweet potato - duh - ricotta and sage). Also check out the Chef's Whim. Have never tried it personally, but I heard the Casanova is also really good!",

    "text": "I have heard about this place for a while and it comes up all the time (on yelp) when I visit my friend in downtown Phoenix.  I have wanted to try this place, but I never wins over all the other places to eat.  Well that changed this time.  My friend wanted to meet for lunch here and I have to say I was impressed, though it has a hipster vibe.    Lets start off by talking about the parking.  It shares a parking lot with Joy Ride Tacos; so if you don't get there early enough, you will be doing the \"complimentary\" valet parking.  But I don't grade on parking, so on to the food...  We ordered two appetizers.  When looking at the menu, we ordered the first one, called the three meatballs and the last one, I dont know that one's name.  The last one is five - six pieces of oven toasted bread and this \"ice cream\" sized scoop of some kind of cheese.  Make sure to use both the mint leaves and the cheese when you eat the bread. That will a huge difference.  Next we got the three meatballs.  The meatballs themselves are not anything special. But it comes with two fried pieces of polenta and toghter.  That becomes a very \"tasty meatball.\"  On to the entrees.  We got two pizzas a sweet potato one and the big star.  The big star was very yummy. It has sausage, green and balck olives, bell peppers. On top of their pizza sauce.  This would have been enough and is was very yummy.  But my friend had to have his sweet potato pizza.  I was pretty concerned with this idea.  But I have an open mind so I tried it.  Best decision today.  It has slices of sweet potato and little bits of cheese (like goat cheese or something). The sweet potato add just enough sweetness and the cheese does not over power the delicious flavors of the pizza dough and sweet potato.  I recommend this pizza, as long as you like sweet potatoes.  Finally dessert. It was my friends birthday so he had a email offering him a free dessert.  We got the \"bubbles;\" which was basically doughnut holes with a chocolate dip.  Again this was also delicious.  The server suggested some kind of Oreo dessart, I'll have to try that next time.   If you don't mind paying a little bit more for pizza, I highly recommend Federal Pizza.  But if you do mind spending a little extra for pizza, I feel sorry for you.  There are so many tasy pizza places that end up on the pricier side.",

I prefer dining in because they have a great happy hour special.   The Big Star pizza is a must try for anyone who looking for something completely unique. It is my favorite menu item complete with all the veggies and meats one could ask for. Perfection! I have also had the Manifesto and Casanova. Both of which were also very good.

The place was a little too loud for my liking, but I'm sensitive to loud places.  My friend and I split a pepperoni pizza. It was good, but not so good that I would make an extra effort to go here over another  pizza joint. Other people in our group had pasta and they looked really good.",

    "text": "There are an awful lot of artisan pizza restaurants in Phoenix these days.  Federal Pizza joins the fray with Pizzzeria Bianca, LGO, The Parlor, and North Fattoria Italiana.  I gotta say, for me, Federal Pizza simply doesn't stack up to the competition.  I wanted so much to fall in love with this place because it's an Upward Projects restaurant and I love pretty much everything they do.    The design, service, clientele, and environment are everything that I love about all the Upward Projects spots.  There is a really great trendy local feel to this place.  Unfortunately, the food just doesn't match up.  At least the pizza doesn't.  Some of the salads and the pork sandwich are pretty good.  I find the pizza crust itself to be bland and uninspired, although it has good consistency and is always cooked appropriately.  The sauces are completely lacking in flavor.  The toppings seem as though they would create interesting flavor profiles, but ultimately fail on that front as well.  Don't even think about the pepperoni or sausage options--you'll be drowned in grease.    I keep going back for the pitchers of beer, friendly environment, and roasted vegetables.",

Yes, I will take visitors to town here, but i myself would prefer to head to Pizzaria Pomo or La Piazza Locale downtown for more authentic Napolitano pizza.    I guess the loud noise, the pretentious atmosphere and staff (are tatoos a requirement for employment here?) and the a bit too exoctic pizza don't do it for me anymore.    On the plus side, It is a nice place to take first timers.  It is kind of a destination type of restaurant worth the short supply of parking, noise and location.  We enjoyed our appetizers of Burata and crustinis, grilled veggie board and the olives.  Two times I have ordered the meatballs with polenta and been disappointed both times, nothing too interesting in that dish.  So as you can see I am torn.  Interesting but not the best in town.    Extra plus note - last night they gave us the wrong pizza (it was missing onions), we had not even noticed.  They realized their mistake and brought out the correct pizza and did not charge us for it, we took it home, I had some for breakfast today and it was pretty good cold.",

We started our meal with the meatball trio appetizer and it was really, really good. The meatballs were very tender and full of flavor.   We shared some pizza (cheese pizza) as well and it was also delicious. The appropriate amounts of sauce/cheese/crust ratio. The rest of the menu sounded great and we wanted to try other items but we kind of had to try the pizza for out first visit.   I would recommend a visit to this place but I'm not sure if I would ever crave it or NEED to go back, but if people wanted to go, I wouldn't say no!",

They have a patio that I bet helps with seating when it's not blistering hot outside.    I would have given another star if we didn't have to wait so long for a table and if our waitress wasn't so rude.   The other servers that brought food to our table were super friendly and engaging but the girl with the super short black hair kinda ruined the fun. She should not be a server. She is the type of server that doesn't write anything down, gets it wrong and then gets mad when you want it corrected. We didn't get food we had ordered and drinks that we ordered were not correct etc.   Anyway, go here and if you see that you are about to be served by the girl with super short black hair, politely ask for another server or just deal with her and tell her to write your order down.   Either way the fried polenta will still be delicious!",

The pizza was a great size and the Chardonnay that we got was nice. Our server was a really awesome guy and he gave us so many great suggestions and tips. He let us know that we could do half and half pizzas to try more then just one pizza option which we did. I got the patata Bianca pizza which was good overall but unfortunately a lot of the potatoes were not cooked on the pizza. A lot of them were actually pretty crunchy for not being cooked all the way. My wife got the Casanova pizza and she said she really enjoyed that. We also ordered the wings and polenta fries. The wings were actually really good. I wasn't a huge fan of the honey hot, it was too much honey and not enough hot. The buffalo wings were good though. Polenta fries were crispy and had a nice dip to go with it. I would highly recommend going on Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm to get that pizza and wine special. Great deal.",

My favorite are the Federal Chop or Chicken Panzanella salads and the Big Star pizza or Chefs special. The atmosphere is quick paced and you can see the kitchen staff preparing your meals and baking pizza in the large oven. It has booth, table, bar and outside patio seating and is seemingly always packed! Weve spent many happy hours, dinners and birthdays here.

Driving up, I could only imagine how crowded and insane parking gets for dinner or on the weekend, just keep in mind there is additional parking across the street, with a crossing light to get you safely across rather than j-walking it. I thought it was the coolest thing that they handmade all their wine coolers, so I ordered a Grapefruit Ginger. It was so delicious and refreshing, I wanted to take a 6-pack home, but couldn't do that so I gladly and happily drank it there. This was both of our first times there so we weren't too sure what to get, our waitress recommended the Lunch Special called The Double down. It comes with your choice of 1/2 pizza and a salad. Automatically knowing that's what I I was going to do, I ordered the Chicken Panzanella and the Big Star Pizza, and of course me, knowing me, knew I still needed more, so I also ordered the Buffalo Federal Wings. The wings were delicious and grilled to perfection. The salad... wasn't my ultimate favorite, as the lemon dressing just got to be too sweet and bitter towards the end but were strangely perfect in the beginning. The pizza, on the other hand, I still see in my dreams. The cheese was so perfect, and the toppings wonderfully complimented each other without overpowering the other.  Overall, with the choice if another salad, would not mind coming back, at all.",

Last month, We took my cousin here who was visiting from Wisconsin and we ALL were in AWE of how delicious everything was! Starting with craft brews at the bar til our table was ready, I personally prefer the lighter brews (blondes)but my cousin ordered a stout that was very tangy and he LOVED it! When we were sat at our table, our waiter was extremely friendly and very accommodating.  Starting with the Arancini, Federal Chop & buffalo wings (I wanted the Windsor gold but was out voted) all three starters were phenomenal!  All of us being from upstate NY, we each had to get our own pizza so that we could \"family style it\". My hubby got pepperoni & sausage (eh, he's not big trying new items on pizza). My Cuz ordered the \"chef's whim\" which honestly I don't remember what was on it  but I do know there was only 1 piece left. As for me, the Patata Bianca was calling my name and it was Sooooo Good!  You'd think we were full but NOOOO! Hahaha, we ordered the donuts and YUMMMMY they were. Gone in sixty seconds flat! Since that visit, hubby has taken his mom through the drive through and I'm positive we'll be visiting again soon!  We want to thank everyone at Federal for providing stellar food, a fun ambiance & fantastic service!!!!",

    "text": "Walking into Federal I was pleased to see an open air dining room with tons of sunlight, a full bar and even a pizza bar where u can sit and watch the cooks make the food.  This place is well staffed I must have seen at least ten to fifteen employees.  I was greeted right away by a friendly hostess.  They have this cool row of booths down the center of the dining room.  I wouldn't usually order an appetizer at lunch but couldn't resist the meatball trio served on the most fantastic Italian fried corn meal in a hot deep dish skillet.  It was outstanding and a must try.   I ordered the double down lunch special of half a pizza with choice of half a salad.  The pizza was good but a bit greasy for my liking and my half wedge salad was the best I have ever had.  When lunch was served she asked if I wanted parmesan cheese.  I was so impressed that they brought over a huge brick of cheese and grated it right onto my pizza.  It was super.  They also serve the same iced tea that they do at Joyride Taco which is the best and freshest iced tea I have ever had.  I would have given five stars except the greasyness of the pizza.  May be better with just veggies or ham.",

There is a reason that when you tell people you are moving to PHX they tell you go to Federal Pizza.  It is awesome!  We tried it all!  For apps we had the meatballs and Arancini. For entrees we ordered a pizza as well as the Super Grinder.  My favorite was the Chicken Parm!  It had that amazing sauce on it and the greens instead of pasta just made the dish for me.  Both the beer and wine lists were respectable and bonus points for good English beers!",

So, this jerk not only insulted me with his subtly suggesting I might be a cheapskate scammer but then wanted my address to send nothing.  My assumption is when he saw I didn't live near his zip code he figured I wasn't worth his free meal.

    "text": "I've had the opportunity to visit Federal Pizza several times since they first opened a few years ago. I hate admitting this, but on every single visit, I always end up leaving just a tad disappointed. Mind you, I've never wanted to confess why, as I feel doing so just makes me seem out of touch with what's trending in downtown Phoenix. But I'm going to go ahead and just flat out say it:  Their pizza just ain't that great. Period.    But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad place, because I do feel that there's a lot of things that Federal does right. It's just that the one thing that they fail to do right, just happens to be the most crucial.  Located within a rather trendy area off of Central, Federal operates out of a building that used to be an old bank. The place has that manufactured retro design that fits in pretty consistently with the cluster of other restaurants in the area. Which makes sense, since they're all owned by the same company. Whether or not those things painted on the wall are quotation marks or floating sperm is currently debatable.  One must keep in mind, since these restaurants are all owned by the same company (Upward Projects), this somewhat sterilizes the whole \"local business\" feel. In other words, Federal never really had to \"grow\" as a business in order to build a core customer base. The advantages were already in place from the beginning.  But let's get to the food. For starters, we've had the Mister Mister, which is strangely absent from their online menu. We've also tried their \"seasonal\" burrata.  I'll glady admit that whatever burrata they're using here is prime stuff. Dare I say, it's the best burrata we've tasted - without going outside of Phoenix that is. A creamy texture that's just bursting with flavor, complimented by the awesome fig spread and evoo, I consider it a must-order. My only complaint: the skimpy crostini is an embarrassing inclusion. You get four of them, which combined, is the equivalent of maybe one slice of bread. Sadly, it will be gone before you're even halfway through the cheese. You're then forced to finish the remainder of the rather generous portion of the serving with a fork. I'm sorry, but burrata this good should be served on some thick cuts of house made bread, not paper-thin pathetic little slices of crostini. Another disadvantage, is that it's not always available due to being a seasonal item - even though I've never considered burrata to be seasonal. Whatever.  I'm willing to give them some props with their ordering. Federal allows you to order half-half, including combining red and white sides. This is something that few pizza places seem to allow, as they've developed this uppity attitude that doing so will, in fact, \"ruin\" the pizza. My girlfriend and I debunked this theory years ago, so I'm glad that Federal doesn't put up a fuss.  As for the pizzas: I'm not a big fan of their margherita, as they use whole tomato slices rather than just the sauce. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. La Grande Orange also uses slices, and I still find their pizza to be some of the best in the city. My favorite of all of Federal's option is the Casanova, with the Brussels Sprout and At Last both being clever little creations that serve their purpose. Federal uses high quality ingredients, so they at least understand that aspect of pizza making. But every time I eat here, I'm quickly reminded of why I've never become a regular. Their crust just isn't very good. I typically associate great pizza with bubbly crust that has a nice char to it. This crust is soft, chewy, doughy, and according to my girlfriend, draws comparisons to the crust you'd find at Little Caesar's or Humble Pie.     The Lil' Triple is an excellent dessert, channeling their Churn toasted fluff to be layered on top of Oreo crumbles and chocolate cream/mousse. You can't go wrong with it. But again, things always change here, so I can't really recommend anything because there's no guarantee that it'll be available.    The servers have always been polite and pleasant, despite having some extremely slow service on some pretty dead evenings. Additionally, the restaurant itself is very wisely designed, incorporating heavy sound paneling into the ceiling. This really helps keep the volume under control in a place that can often get pretty crowded.  Like I said, there's good and there's bad. While it's a cool little place that offers some pretty decent selections. Unfortunately, I just can't bring myself to give it more than three stars due to their lackluster pizza crust. If your crust sucks, your pizza sucks.    I used to say it was worth the occasional visit, but I think we've now finally realized that if we want to burn 50 bucks on a dinner, there are far superior pizza places available.",

Came here with my wife to get a free pizza and we were both pleasantly surprised.  The food was very good, as was the alcohol selection.  Started with an order of the roasted veggie board.  It was huge, and it was very good.  A little short on the romesco that comes with it, but small complaint when the veggies were kept large and roasted perfectly.  Also ordered the Caesar.  A good Caesar, and their dressing is more garlicky (as advertised) which we appreciated.  Finally, ordered the Big Star pizza.  Schreiner's sausage, pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms, olives, and onions.  It is a very good pizza.  Crust had some flavor, though not all blistered with dark bits.  But it has good crunch with an interior chew.  The toppings all tasted great, but all put together, tasted a little muddled?  Apart from being just a tad over-greasy (I get it, it's a pizza), the balance was a little lost compared to the truly great pizzas we've had.    Still, a very good pizza and a welcome addition to the nationally underrated Valley pizza scene.    Come for the pizza, stay for the booze and veggie board.  Too many other 5-star pizza joints out there in the States, can't give these guys 5 stars.",

Federal takes that artisan style craft pizza inspired by Bianco & removes all of the unnecessary fuss that isnt needed when youre having PIZZA.   There always a fun and adventurous array of toppings & the starters usually change so you can enjoy a nice change of pace for each visit.   Staff is decent, they tip share so the urgency is lacking & your server/bartender will go missing quite often.  Pricing of food & most drinks is fantastic.  The beer selection is above average, lots of same ol same ol that is already sold all over the valley.  Wine selection usually has at least something palatable, but their list is focused more on the price point crowd & not the enthusiast.   Girls bring a sweater, the AC is always blasting in here.   Bottom line, this is some of the best pizza in the valley & it would be awesome if they were open late.",

    "text": "Several friends had recommended this place to me, so I was really looking forward to my first experience at Federal.  A coworker suggested that we go to celebrate my recent promotion. I made a reservation for 15 people for 5 pm that night. The hostess on the phone was really sweet and only asked that we be conscious that another large group was coming in at 8.  Being that this was a large party and we had approximately 3 hours before the next group came in, it seemed reasonable to me that not all 15 people would arrive right at 5. By 6 pm, about half the group had arrived and most of us had ordered drinks and apps--however, this was about the time we started getting pressure from the waiter and hostess. About every 20 minutes, they would come up to the table and ask where the rest of the party was. In turn, I was texting my group to get their ETA and let them know the staff was getting irritated. I learned there was a bad accident on the 10 and most of them were stuck in traffic, but they were all on their way. During this time I was still ordering drinks so the staff didn't feel like their time was being wasted, but this became difficult to do as our waiter had stopped appearing at our table.  Once again, the hostess came up and asked if the rest of the party was still coming. I explained that they were, but that traffic was bad. She let me know that they needed the extra tables to seat people and I told her she could take them. The tables were not taken though and the rest of the group had arrived and ordered by 7. The waiter made some passive aggressive comments to the latecomers about being 2 hours late.  I've worked in food service and I know that dealing with flaky customers is frustrating. However, I was doing my best to make the most out of the situation and I feel like our waiter was pretty rude about it. The food itself was okay, but it wasn't good enough to compel me to return anytime soon.",

The gal who answered the phone to take my order was sharp (not always the case in my experience), efficient, and professional... with a little added warmth to make you feel served even on the phone.  I arrived a little early to grab my Zaa and decided to drive to the drive up door.  I was greeted at my window promptly and my food was brought out to my car! Sadly no roller skates, but hey car side service is pretty sweet!  Pizza was really good, crust perfect, toppings excellent, defiantly fits the upper echelon pies in the area. On par with Parlor, Humble Pie for sure.  Will update after I make it back for a sit down... also I heard a rumor that they have half price Growlers for take out!  Going back for sure!",

It was also nice to see lots of folks who seem to know each other--certainly a great addition to  our neighborhood.",

My friend did the same.  Unfortunately we left, forgetting our boxes.  As we were walking back to our cars I realized our mistake and quickly called to see if we could come back and get them.  I was notified they were already thrown away.  Then the sadness came!!!  I was really looking forward to having the pizza for lunch tomorrow and really upset I just paid $14 for 3 pieces of pizza.  I realize it was our mistake but I'm writing this to make the suggestion that if people inadvertently leave their boxed leftovers behind please keep them for at least 15 minutes before tossing them!!!  Thanks.  Still sad.",

I didn't get a chance to actually try their beers because I ordered food for take-out, but I saw what they had on tap and they were all solid options. The pizza was pretty good, we had the manifesto which I liked and the meatball one which we both thought was delicious and the best out of the two. Also got a caesar salad which was $10 and was just lettuce, croutons, and caesar dressing. You can tell the dressing was made fresh, but aside from that it just seemed like a plain caesar you would get for free as a side. As for the service, I can't really say much about it, but it did seem like it was lacking a bit. They didn't bring me any utensils, even though I got a salad, and they didn't bring me a bag to carry all of my things in. It wasn't crowded at the time so I don't think there should be any excuse of forgetting those things unless they were just not used to handling take-out orders.",

    "text": "Went to this new Upward Project restaurant last Friday for date night with my boyfriend.  We had been wanting to try it for awhile, as we both LOVE Postinos, Windsor, and well, pizza!  I had an email from my birthday which gave us a guaranteed reservation and free dessert.  I called in the car on the way there, and they said they would put my name at the top of the list.  When we arrived, they had already put my name in and said they would call when ready.  Well 40 minutes later, my boyfriend went to ask about how much longer, and they had lost my reservation.  We went back to wait, this time only about 5 minutes.  Sadly though, when they came to seat us, we were jammed in at the hot and crowded pizza oven bar.  One of the seats we were given was not even a regular seat with a back, rather a bar stool from the outside.  We quickly said that will not do, and the hostess seated us in a cute, romantic booth by the patio.  Problem solved...thank you Federal Pizza!  Now that all is well, we ordered the brussel sprout side dish and the date, ricotta, arugula, and prosciutto pizza.  The brussel sprouts were a little lemony, but the panchetta made everything better.  The pizza was delicious...I would highly recommend trying it!   The silver lining about this place is they will come take your drink order while you wait for your table, then add it to your tab at the end.  For a trendy place like this, I will happily wait if there is a big glass of Cab in my hand!    Can't wait to go back and experiment with more pizzas!",

I ordered a vegetable board, and when one of the servers (not even mine or the one I made the order to) saw that it wasn't vegan, she had them redo it and comped it from my bill. It was delicious. I also had a vegan pizza and it was excellent. Will be back!!",

There was a cocktail server that brought us drinks within a few minutes Waiting gave us time to look over the menu as well.   There were three of us and we decided to do an appetizer and two pizzas. For our app we got the burrata, recommended by our server. It was good, nothing amazing, but good. It was a little bland for me, so I added the basil garnish which gave it a little something of what it was lacking. And for pizzas we got the Big Star and the Chef's Whim. Both were absolutely amazing and I don't think I could pick a favorite. The Big Star has Schreiner's sausage, Molinari pepperoni, red and yellow bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and wood roasted onions. Everything on the pizza was great, even the olives were tolerable and I hate olives. Probably some of the best pepperoni I have ever had. The Chef's Whim that night had sauteed shrimp, sweet yellow corn, asparagus, peppers (some kind of small, sweet red peppers), lemon zest, cheese blend and instead of red sauce it was a roasted garlic sauce. I was surprised at how amazing this pizza was!   I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say bad service because our service was on point. Our beer and wine came out within a couple minutes during our entire meal. Our waters were topped off by at least four servers, plates were cleared right after finishing, and box and check came out right after we asked. We had an awesome experience and we will definitely be going back soon! We will also be taking advantage of their drive thru option :)",

A sweeter pizza, but the creaminess of the ricotta, the saltiness of the prosciutto and the freshness of the arugula were great balance.

Now my husband is a typical pepperoni and cheese, and our waiter suggested going outside the box, if we did not like it he'd put in an order for pepperoni. Man, are we ever glad we tried it! Savory, sweet, salty, fresh explosion in your mouth. That dates give it a semi hint of sweetness and the fresh arugula was just enough to give a fresh bite...  A must try!!! Trust me!!! The prices are just right, service was outstanding. Can't wait to go back.",

The place is always poppin' it seems like. The layout of the restaurant is interesting, but fun. I enjoyed myself while here. They get pretty busy, but we didn't have to wait. The server was friendly and accommodating. You won't regret coming here and check out other Upward Projects restaurants while you are at it. They have some great ones!",

It did not resemble meatloaf at all nor did it taste the same.  You know the taste the flavored bread crumbs adds to it.  It was more like a hamburger that fell apart. Or maybe if they called it Salisbury steak it would be more appropriate. The employees were just great as was the pitcher of beer. Due to this I will give it 4 stars. I MAY try the pizza nest time although I am a pizza snob and in my 25+ years in Phoenix have found only 1 place that makes Sicilian Pizza just like in The Big Apple. So I am not too sure that I will return here",

Ceilings are partly exposed, partly textured. Awesome light fixtures. Interior is well done!   Burrata appetizer - Amazing...could have eaten the entire thing alone. MINE!! Don't forget to enjoy the basil \"garnish\" with the cheese. It really brings out the flavor.   Corn \"coins\"  appetizer - Meh! Next.   Cassanova Pizza - VERY good but the a typical ricotta, date and arugula pie.  Brussel Sprout Pizza - My favorite mostly because it was unique. Little bit of a lemony tang on the sprouts + salty from the pancetta. Also could have eaten alone! MINE! MINE!   Enjoy!",

    "text": "Incredible service from the hostess to the kitchen. Only downfall is they are really busy all the time. Good for them, not the greatest when you are starving. Of course I guess that would be my own fault.  We went there with some friends to check it out.  We ended up ordering a butload of food to split.  Here goes:  There was a chef's special bruschetta - can't remember what's on it but it was REALLY good!  Big Artichoke:  This is not something I would order as my hubby wouldn't normally eat this and I would end up eating the whole thing.  However, this time he tried it and loved it!  It was large and had quite a bit of \"meat\" on it.  Patty Jane:  Perfect to split between the four of us.  Specifically because of all the other food we ordered.  The pears were poached perfectly and the dressing complimented the salad very well.  Manifesto Pizza:  My hubby and I ordered this, without the fennel as we are not fans.  It's Schreiner's sausage.  How can you go wrong!  Casanova Pizza:  Our friends ordered this one.  As I said earlier, we all shared everything.  This is not a pizza I would have EVER ordered.  Holy crap was it good!!!  (we ordered no dates as we are not fans)  The ricotta and pecorino cheeses melted in my mouth.  Yummmmmm!!!  Lamb Bolognese:  I said I was hungry.... My hubby actually ordered this because he said he wasn't in the mood for pizza (he was wrong, ate both).  It was a little rich for me, but lamb can be rich after a while.  The sauce was amazing.  For the record, we did have quite a bit of left-overs taken home.  We all enjoyed the dinner very much and will be back.  By the way, if you can, ask for Jill.  She is an amazing server!  Just the best!",

I had never been here before, but heard great things.  I ordered the half-pizza/half-salad combo. The food was quite good, but what impressed me most was the service!  I was not drinking alcohol. The bartender consistently refilled my soda and water glasses, even offering me a \"to-go\" cup for my soda. He came back after I paid my bill (with credit card, tip already calculated) and offered to refill my glasses again. This was one of the few times I received great service even after the server had been paid. He deserved the additional cash tip I left for exceptional service.  To sum it up, while the food alone is a great reason to return to Federal Pizza, the service made the experience exceptional!",

It was pretty busy, but we were seated reasonably quickly. We shared a few pizzas and pitchers and everyone had a great time.   My second visit, a few weeks ago, is what made me want to write this review. This time it was just my boyfriend and myself for dinner on a week night. I ordered the veggie lasagna. It wasn't an unusual amount of time before our food came out, and everything looked and tasted spectacular. The manager came to our table to ask how everything was, and apologized for what he said was a long wait for our food. He told us that they make a point to get the food out within a specific time frame. The lasagna is a new menu item, and because it is thick, he said they were still working on getting it out within their goal time. He told us that he would take the lasagna off of our bill.  We were so impressed that he went above and beyond to fix something that we didn't even think was a problem. The service and food are great, and the whole place looks amazing. We look forward to returning again and again.",

Not sure what I was expecting, but was surprised, as moving to uptown Phoenix recently, I have found most restaurants close early and restaurants seem to clear out by 9pm.  Federal Pizza is an exception as it stays open as late as midnight on Friday & Saturday nights.    The evening started out perfectly, as once we checked in, we were offered drinks while we waited.  Time always seems to go by quicker with a cocktail in hand.  After about a  20 minute wait, we were seated.  The restaurant is beautiful, clean and smelled great.  We ordered a combination pizza and a couple appetizers.  The pizza had wonderful flavors but the only flaw was a less than crispy crust, that I blame on all of the toppings.  Next time we might try something without so many toppings.    As parking is tight in this neighborhood, you must use the valet or expect a bit of a walk.  As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I am not a big fan of valet and even worse, the valet guy called me \"Boss\" which for some reason rubs me the wrong way.  Message to valet guys, I prefer to be called \"Sir\" or 'Your Majesty\"",

    "text": "Woohoo, I finally visit a place that's newly opened! Ahead of the curve for once! :)  Visited Federal Pizza after the great review from Chow Bella (I think...) regarding the Corn Coins. Went after work on a Thursday, and while the place was very busy, my friend and I were seated immediately.  Service was a little slow, but, like I said, it was very busy. Plus, the extra time gave us plenty of time to debate the menu and choose what we wanted!  We ended up ordering the At Last pizza, Corn Coins, and wine coolers (I had the hibiscus one-- delicious!)  The pizza was GREAT!! It has chiles on it, which adds a little spice and unexpected flavor. The crust held all the veggies really well, but the veggies didn't even overwhelm the pizza. All in all, great!  My friend didn't exactly like the thin crust, but as long as you know it's thinner crust pizza going in, you should be okay.  Disappointing? The Corn Coins. They got a great review from the New Times, but I just didn't like them. I don't know what I was expecting, but they were messy to eat, corn got all up in our teeth, and it was just generally 'meh.' If you love corn, or know what you're getting into with corn coins, go for it! I just wouldn't order it again. Also-- NOT recommended for first dates!  Unexpectedly amazing? The WINE COOLERS! Oh yeah buddy! They bring you the wine cooler in an old school glass bottle that you then pour yourself into a wine glass filled with ice.  My (raspberry? can't remember) hibiscus wine cooler was awesome!! Surprisingly strong, and incredibly delicious. I think I'm going to get 5... I mean 2... the next time I go to FP!  It was ~$20 for both of us, with an appetizer, a split pizza, and drinks. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of was the parking... I KNOW the owners of FP (along with their other restaurants) love doing the complimentary valet parking, I'm just not a fan of having to carry dollars around with me for tip. I don't really carry money around at all, and it's just something else to remember.  All said though, I'll go back. Mostly because of those wine coolers :)",

Federal Pizza is in an old bank building (by Al Beadle), with a really nice open layout, big windows, a nice patio out front, retro decor - every table had different salt & pepper shakers & there are different mid-century lights around the building. And the kitchen is open with the oven right out there in view. Loved the decor.   I went with friends from work for lunch the other day, (maybe a week after they opened) and then with another friend from out of town & my husband last night.  The food was fabulous each time!  Loved the wood-fired pizza. The dough is great - chewy and crisp all at once (cudos to Michael Coe) - probably the second best in town. Better than Bianco's & better than the Parlor. Maybe not quite as good as, but very very close to Grazies. I've had the Manifesto (with Schriners sausage), the Casanova (with arugula, dates & prosciutto) and the Big Star Pizza (Schriners Sausage, red & Yellow peppers, roasted onions, etc.). They were all great.   We also had the Corn Coins (both times!) - roasted corn with cheese, herbs & salt - cut into little coins that are great to munch on.  We also had the baratta & bread, which was good...but I think they could have added some kind of little tid-bit to go with it as baratta is good, but best when you have something else spicy/sweet/savory to put a dab on it with the bread.   We also had the wedge salad last night - and it was great. Very flavorful, nice fresh lettuce, crispy bacon, etc. We loved it. Next time I'll order my own rather than sharing...it was that good.  I was particularly excited to try their \"wine coolers\"...but don't even think about the bottles sweet wine cooler things in the grocery store. I had the Grapefruit & ginger wine cooler, and it was spectacular. I loved it. So fresh & flavorful and just a tiny bit sweet.   Service was great both times - our waiter at lunch was incredibly helpful and made great suggestions.  I can't wait to go back for Happy Hour - they have the 5$ before 5 deal just like Postinos.   Great new restaurant - go try it!",

    "text": "Federal Pizza is absolutely deserving of 5 stars. Amazing food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. All around this place is great.  The boyfriend and I hit up Federal PIzza for lunch on a Saturday. It was busy but we were able to snag a comfy booth in the middle. Our waiter, I think his name was Dan, was immediately welcoming, funny and charming.   The menu has lots of yummy-sounding choices but we decided to try the wedge salad and the prosciutto pizza. The salad was a bit of a twist on the traditional wedge. It was made with romaine instead of iceberg (which was a welcome change) and had dates, tomatoes and ranch dressing with gorgonzola instead of the traditional bleu cheese. The size was generous - at least for two - and the flavor combinations worked well. A good start to the meal.  The pizza was out of this world. Loaded with fresh prosciutto, arugula, dates and ricotta cheese. This is easily my new favorite pizza in the valley. The crust was doughy and chewy in the best way possible and cooked perfectly. Every bite was delicious and surprisingly filling.  Of course we did save room for dessert (there's always room for dessert). We ordered the donuts with chocolate sauce. There were eight pretty big donuts covered in sugar and served hot. Not warn, hot. Yum. Dip those suckers in the chocolate sauce and you'll have a hot donut celebration. One thing I thought was a little weird was that they took our dinner plates and did not bring small plates for the donuts. Our table was a mess of sugar afterwards. But who cares, they were delish.  Overall I was very impressed with Federal Pizza. I already want to go back. Hopefully they will open one in the East Valley, pretty please???",

    "text": "They make a mean Manifesto!  This is my new LGO. Sorry, LGO but this place is g-oo-d!  A coworker and I went and sat at the bar during lunch hour. The bartender was very friendly and attentive, even while he was busy making drinks for the other guests. He helped us understand their menu and shared some background with us on their favorite dishes.  After such a great experience and realizing they have a drive-thru, I was hooked!  I love calling in my Manifesto and picking it up without getting out of my car (or unbuckling my toddler to run in for a quick errand). Makes for a great Friday night at home with pizza and a movie!  We had the grilled vegetable plate too, prior to the manifesto pizza, and for not being a cauliflower fan they sure do know how to make yummy cauliflower!  I ate it all and wanted more.   3 thumbs up, if I could!",

The burrata is amazing!  We normally don't get appetizers but went for a special occasion so decided to go all in.  The burrata is one of my fav dishes in phx.  The dessert would be my #1 fav dessert in phoenix.  The oreo crust, amazing chocolate mousse and then marshmallow topping is to die for.  Its even better than the Citizen Public Houses similar offering.",

My parents come from the midwest every winter and stay with us for 1-2 months, and it is a MUST have for my dad...he absolutely loves (and claims to dream about!) their iced tea.  So imagine his excitement, when after telling our waitress how much he loves it, that she pulls him up a growler of the stuff AND sends home a package of the loose leaf so he can brew his own back home.  He literally hugged the waitress and the manager, he was so happy.  THAT, is customer service.  The Manifesto pizza, the sweet potato pizza, and especially the Answer pizza...to die for. And ALWAYS order the meatball appetizer, even if it is just to eat the fried polenta!  Thank you, FP, for making my dad's experience unforgettable.",

My mother ordered a salad but asked the kitchen to substitute romain for the mixed greens.  When it arrived, it was mixed greens but the waitress insisted it was romain... She and I have eaten enough salad to know the difference.    Anyway, she sent it back (no apology from the staff) and we received our pizzas.  The pizzas were pretty good.  Nothing out of this world. Then, after we were finished with our meal they brought her salad back with only arugula... :-/ c'mon.    Because my mother is sweet-as-can-be, she just ask that they box it up.

When it came out, there were no mushrooms (allergy) but there were olives (preference).    The manager came over and rather unexpectedly comped our dinner.  That was totally unnecessary!  I'd have just picked the olives off, and would have paid for the pizza.    What it shows is that this company places excellence above all else.  I'm in.  I'll be back.  Oh, and I left the server a great tip.  The entire staff deserved it.",

Ordered a brussel sprouts, pancetta & manchego pizza to share. Amazing. Superb crust. Best touch was a touch of lemon juice on the pie, which provided just a hint of acid to cut the fat and saltiness of the cheese and pancetta. Server was really nice and fun. Tough to beat.

The music was too loud, but that just seems to be the way it goes at hip restaurants nowadays....They brought us out a free appetizer almost immediately. We didnt look a gift horse in the mouth and very much enjoyed the fried veggies and polenta sticks we were given.  Mom ordered the beet and pear salad and made yummy noises the whole time she ate it.  It was lovely, but then I'm a beet slut.  Dad had a pepperoni pizza and was very happy.  The pizza's crust was perfect!  I stumbled upon the porchetta sandwich and even Tony Soprano would order this from Federal on the regular.  It may be the best sandwich ever.  So simple yet complex, the bread was divine, the pork super flavorful....I want one now.  BTW, you can order takeout and they have a drive thru window.....and you can leave there with your own growler of various fancy ales.  Just awesome........kudos!",

Had burratta to start which came with some grilled bread which we liked. Also had a pizza with sausage, goat cheese, mushrooms and onions. Liked the crust it was nice and light and the toppings were all of high quality. Also had sides of brussels w/ pancetta and a meatball in sauce and both were good. Other pluses were the beer list and the wine list as well as the retro diner-like ambiance. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and I will be back but I must warn people who read reviews that compare this place to Bianco that it is not at that level. Not that they themselves are claiming that its just that every time a good pizza place opens up some yelp reviewers claim that Bianco has been bested or equalled and it just isn't the case. As long as you don't go in with those expectations you will find some pretty delicious pizza and some great drinks in a nice atmosphere.",

    "text": "To confess, I came here only because the wait at Bianco was 2-3 hours, but I was pleased with the outcome. The beet starter was delicious - a lot of flavor packed into small dish. The grapefruit ginger and strawberry rhubarb wine coolers were wonderful - light and refreshing. My party shared two pizzas: the Big Star and the chef's daily selection, a vegetarian selection which apparently used to be a regular on the menu, with roasted corn and arugula. Both were very good although I probably would have liked a bit more corn and a tad less arugula on the latter. I'm an out-of-towner but definitely would not hesitate to return because so many other items on the menu sounded enticing. Service was efficient with two minor complaints: one of the three starters was delayed; and when I asked that the check be given to me (as opposed to someone else in my party), because of the team service model, my request wasn't fulfilled.",

    "text": "tried federal pizza for the first time last night.  easy to park and get a table. we were seated as soon as we walked in.  the 3 different people who waited on us were quick to let us order drinks/ refill/ bring out the food, but once we were served our main dish no one came by until it was time for the check.   normally that would have been fine- except the food was sub-par.  ordered the burrata, sea salt olive oil on crostini.  it was okay, but not as great as the waitor made it sound.  we also ordered the \"Big Star\" pizza.  toppings were inconsistent, some slices had sauce and cheese only while others were loaded with all the veggies and toppings.   needless to say the \"take and bake\" pizza i had from costco was better then the food i ate last night.   i wouldn't order either dish again.    the ambiance is nice, good for a date night or a smaller group going out to dinner.  we sat inside at a table closer to the bar, i didn't feel as if i had to yell to hear, but we were a little tight squeezed with the group next to us.     overall, it was not the experience i was hoping for, i could live off postinos, and enjoy windsor. federal pizza won't get a repeat visit from us.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try Federal Pizza for the first time for a day after Christmas late lunch. And even at 2:30pm, the place was packed. We had to wait briefly for a table, but only about 7 minutes or so. The vibe is hipster, but less so than Windsor. We decided to try the Corn Coins as an appetizer because my husband had heard good things about them, and we weren't disappointed. They basically took a corn on the cob, sliced it into thin coins, and grilled it, then topped with fennel, cheese, and paprika. The corn could have been cooked a little more in my opinion, but it was good. It was similar to the elote at Gallo Blanco, only with less cheese. On to the main course: I got the margherita pizza, and my husband ordered the meatball sub. We were happily enjoying the corn coins when one of the servers came up and said that they were remaking my pizza because the first one grew a large air bubble and it wasn't up to their standards. He was very nice, and we appreciated him taking the time to tell us that. That said, the pizza arrived within 5 minutes, so I never would have noticed anyway if they hadn't said anything. The pizza was amazing--just the right amount of olive oil, cheese browned to perfection, and that CRUST! It was delicious. My husband loved the meatball sub and said the meatballs were spicy. All in all, we were able to take a half of the pizza and a couple remaining corn coins home, and I didn't feel overly stuffed. (Can't say the same for the husband--he ate the entire meatball sub.) Bill came to just under $30 before tip, which was reasonable. We will definitely be back--I'm sure they do a great happy hour.",

    "text": "What a cute place! First visit last night with a pal, who had not been there either. Great service and engaged staff. However, I am a bit perplexed at the rave reviews for food. From the side menu, we had a little salad and the meatballer (one meat ball.) Both were great--good food quality and a nice way to taste a few items for next time. My disappointment was in the pepperoni pizza. It looked great, but my first thought at the initial bite was \"oh, no, frozen pizza.\" From the reviews I was expecting something on par with the good old days at Pizzeria Bianco or the good new days at Lamp in North Scottsdale. The pizza literally tasted like frozen food. My friend did not comment at all, so I am figuring she didn't want to mention it, since it was my suggestion. I brought a few slices home for my son and asked him his thoughts...his first words were the same as mine! Again, I wish them well--cool place and nice menu, with good variety. Perhaps some of the other pizzas really deliver, but the pepperoni did not!",

    "text": "Tried this place yesterday afternoon with some girlfriends, we had a great time and I'm looking forward to returning! The decor/atmosphere is open and roomy, which is a nice change from Postino's, where I feel a bit claustrophobic when it's crowded.  It took a while for our server to get our drink order even though there were several of them standing around talking in the corner.  But after that, things were smooth.  The servers seem like they think they're a little 'too cool for school', but they were young and friendly so whatever.  The drink menu is great, a nice variety of wines, beers, and my friends loved the wine coolers.  I bought a growler to bring home for my husband, so that is a cool perk.  We had the buratta/crostini app which was delicious!  Cheese and bread,  yum!  The cheese was so smooth and delish!  I split a Caesar salad with my friend and that was just okay, wouldn't order that again.  We each got pizzas, they're around 12 inches, good for 1-2 people depending on how hungry you are.  I stayed simple and ordered the pepperoni.  I loved the chewy, crispy crust that was cooked well done just how I like it! Just the right amount of cheese and sauce.  I'm craving more as I write!  My friends ordered some of the more eclectic pizzas and we were all happy with the results.  I recommend!  A great place for happy hour, date night, or girls day/night out!",

My party shared a couple of apps, two different pizzas, and the spaghetti. No complaints at all and we enjoyed them all. One member of the party did not like his wine cooler but I tried it and found no issue with it. Purely a subjective thing, although he is, by his own admission, a professional drinker.  There were a few service issues with the hostess and the runners but not at all with our server, who was terrific. (I own a restaurant and am extremely sensitive to service.) Our server's name was Lucy and she was very professional and, more than anything, CARED!  She obviously likes her job and her employer and this attitude made for a great bond between host and guest. If you go to FP be sure to request one of her tables.  I should also add that the on-duty manager, whose name I did not get, had the same caring attitude. If FP continues to employee people such as these two it can only succeed.",

If you like eating burnt pizzas in a room with the music so loud it sounds like you're in the trunk of a low-rider then this is the place for you. It was lunch time so the music should be scaled back to suit the patrons, not the wait staff. Maybe its more appropriate at night but lunch time is usually conversation time. The menu is small...8 pizzas, 4 sandwiches and 3 desserts. Just very surprised that every pizza that was delivered to us and our surrounding tables had a black, burned crust. The sandwich was outstanding....but this is called Federal PIZZA. I'll try again in a month to see if they have improved.",

I sit outside in the freezing (you know, 50 degrees!) weather for my table, under a nice warmer and they bring me a DRINK! Cool beans!  I am such a weird eater, and make that disclaimer to all our wait staff. So the polenta appetizer and a side of beets for dinner doesn't even make her bat an eye. And both are fantastic. The beets come with pears, romano cheese shavings and pistachios. (There were some greens on top, but I dispensed with them---way too healthy!) The polenta is cooked, sliced into sticks, fried and covered in parmesan (do you feel the \"cheese\" theme?). The grapefruit ginger wine cooler recommended by one of the wait staff was a great compliment to my selections.  Hubby had the \"Big Star\" pizza, a manly and meaty pizza, which he completely devoured. He had a nice small pitcher of beer that fit the bill.  We were too stuffed to even think about dessert, but we'll be back (maybe tomorrow?) to hit that part of the menu.   As stated in countless other reviews, ambiance is great, menu swell and I have to say, after the week I had dealing with snarly vendors, what a nice change of pace in the service department!  Love Churn, Love Windsor and now I officially (YELP) Love Federal Pizza!",

    "text": "First time here.  2.5 stars.  Mediocre.   We started off by valeting our car, which is absurd considering there is a giant parking lot available.   Restaurant was decorated appealingly, modern with clean lines and open.  Designed to bring the outdoors indoors.  Lovely.    Seating & Drinks: We were seated right away.  2 adults, 2 children in the 7-10 year old range.  We were promptly attended to; however, the waitress seemed rushed to take our order.  There was no cordialness about her.  Drinks arrived promptly.  I ordered a glass of the Sean Minor Pinot Noir (very good flavor, but I wouldn't say it was worth $12 a glass, considering it's in the less than $20 range (OUCH$$$).  She hurriedly poured a portion and walked off... it was so abrupt and took me back a bit as to what the heck her problem was?  Apps & Dinner: We ordered the Roasted Veg appetizer.  It was perfect.  It was a thing of beauty.  Roasted fennel, baby carrots, fingerling potatoes, broccolini, and cauliflower.  We, kids too, really enjoyed the flavor & freshness of the veggies.    Dinner arrived shortly thereafter. Friend recommended the Casanova & two kids pizzas.  The pizza recommendation was spot on!  Arugula, pecorino cheese both melded together perfectly and the sweetness of the dates offset the peppery taste of the arugula.  Brilliant.  The dough of the pizza was not burnt (I did see several burnt crusts, and I was praying that ours wouldn't turn out that way.)  It came out perfectly golden brown.  Crust was thick, chewy & light all at the same time, best crust I've ever had.  The kids really enjoyed  their little personal pizzas as well.  Good size for the kids... they weren't able to finish the pizza.  This is the part where it really takes a turn for the worse.... we finished our food... plates were cleared by hipster bus boys several times... but still no waitress, my husband even called out to her two times as she was walking by and apparently the music must be way to loud because she ignored him.  Still waiting... and waiting... it gets to the point where it was really uncomfortable and then poof!  She arrives, and says, \"Ready for your check?\"  She never came by the table to check on us, NOR ask if I would like another glass of wine, NOR asked if we would like a dessert.  It was evident that she wanted us out of there.  Great.  So we decided to order dessert...lol.  Right, we got the Bombolino (sp) which is pizza dough fried and dusted in sugar and served with melted dark chocolate dipping sauce.  The dough/sugar combo was FLAVORLESS, even with the chocolate... 3 of the dough balls were RAW inside... I had to open the rest to check to see if they were even edible. The Bombolino was actually so bad, the two sugar loving kids became uninterested in the dessert.  The berry cobbler was really good but nothing to write home about.  Desserts finished... once again, the waitress was nowhere to be found, THANKFULLY, I think it was the manager who stopped by and was very friendly, who we were able to ask for our check and she returned with it promptly.   I would've given this place more stars, but the food couldn't carry this place by itself.  You are serving pizza, you HAVE-TO HAVE-TO HAVE-TO back up your food by GRACIOUS service.  It ruined the experience for us.  As good as the pizza was, it wasn't good enough to really bring us back in the future.   We do still love Postino's.   Last but not least, we went to get our car from valet.  The car was parked in the parking space right next to the valet stand...right.  Thanks for pulling out our car 10 feet so we can get in.  So awkward.  Things they should address:  You cannot tell the staff apart from the patrons.  They should wear something that indicates that they employees.  Do they need a uniform?  No, but they do need something to differentiate them.  They should also fix the parking valet situation when it's not necessary during the evening, it's just plain silly.   Definitely better customer service skills from our waitress, so maybe higher expectations for their employees.  It's a shame that one person can bring a negative atmosphere to a good restaurant.",

First impression is this place is aesthetically pleasing, and there's quite a bit of attention to detail. I can see why \"hipsters\" are drawn here. More importantly, everything looked shiny and clean.  2) I get to see how the the place runs when everyone's not \"on.\" You know what I mean. Things are different when it isn't showtime.   Though I'm not a big meat-eater, we went for the meatball trio and the side of beets to start.   The meatballs were awesome, flavorful, and the perfect texture, and the marinara was right on. The real star of the dish was the polenta, with a perfect crunch on the outside and creamy inside. There was a bit of fork-shoving to get the last of it.  Beets and pears are a great combination, but we both felt like it was lacking something until we snagged a bottle of balsamic vinegar.   For the pizza we shared the margherita with added roasted garlic (our server's favorite as well, what a coinkidink!). The crust was unlike any I've had before. Not at all chewy, light and airy with a nice crispiness without being like a cracker. I really enjoyed it.  I would have loved to try the wine coolers, but $8? Come on.  After all that goodness, I didn't have room to try the cobbler. The great news is, they have a drive-thru, so I'll get my chance!",

First off, good luck finding the place. There is no signage on the street or building, we actually walked through the door to the hostess and asked if we were in the right place. We were.   We were seated quickly and the staff was all very nice. The music in this place is a touch to loud for a Monday afternoon lunch crowd.   For starters we ordered the meatball trio and the fried polenta sticks. Both were freaken amazinnnnng!!!!   For pizzas we ordered the standard Pepperoni and then also the Big Star. Both pizzas were good, but didn't knock my socks off. Also they were a bit greasy and the crust was pretty chewy and hard to cut through with a fork.  The hubs and I both agreed that we would most likely not be going back unless someone invited us out and that's where they wanted to go. It wasn't a terrible experience it was just meh for us.",

    "text": "Ummmm...don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the Upward Project restaurant concepts (owners of The Windsor and Postinos), but I'm not sure why all the stars on this one....must be the locals who are thrilled to have another establishment they can bike to.  We ordered the Big Star Pizza (Sausage, pepperoni, onion, green pepper,, mushroom,, black and green olives).   The pizza dough/crust was fabulous, in part due to the wood-fire, but also because the master-chef is a genius.   The flavor of the pizza was fabulous, however it was SUPER SUPER LIGHT on the cheese (which is upsetting to a cheese-person).  We also order the spaghetti and meatballs...bleh.  It came out luke warm, although the meatballs had an excellent flavor.  One thing my husband and I were joking about was that we couldn't tell who worked there and who was a customer.  Not only did we have 5 or six different people stopping by our table to serve us, but this establishment definitely services the younger-urban-hipster crowd (not that there is anything wrong with that :) and we didn't know if the person walking toward us was a customer or a server (we got a kick out of that).   And for the record, my husband and I are in our 40s and felt comfortable there, but we were notably (well...part of me hopes not too notably) older.  I thought the servers were friendly, but not especially attentive.  But then, I'm one of those who struggles with finding a hovering server as annoying as a server is never checks on us....I'm like Goldylocks...I want a service that is \"just\" the right amount of attention.  So, in short,  I would certainly go again, but I think I prefer in order: Postinos, The Windsor and Federal Pizza.",

I'm not a big fan of gourmet pizzas. I don't my pizza made by someone who went to culinary school but rather by some high school kid who's high on herb. Best part of the pizza was the crust as it was crispy. The pie would be soo much better if there were 300% more cheese on it BUT that's probably the Midwest-iner in me coming out.",

I was lucky enough to be dining out with a birthday girl during their first week, so we snagged a reservation.  It was awesome to skip through the long wait and get straight to the good stuff.  Our server was just the right percentage hipster without being too much.  He was friendly and knowledgable, and we had a few good laughs with him throughout the night.    We ordered the burrata appetizer, which was delicious, but we needed more bread to go with it.  Don't be skimpy, Federal!  The date, ricotta, and arugula pizza was incredibly delicious, but was a tad heavy on the dates and needed more prosciutto.  I'm more of a fan of the fig spread that can be found at Postino's... the dates are just a bit too chewy and strong.  A swap out would be good!  Best part?  The absolutely divine homemade wine coolers.  The combination of flavors were perfect (we sampled them all between all of the girls at our table).  This alone would make me return!   Well done, Federal.... well done.",

With the restaurant being an old bank building, I love that they've maintained the drive thru lane and we can just drive up to pay and receive our order.  It's ridiculously convenient.

There are a lot of great places to get pies in this town but only a few good sit down and drink and eat pizza places.  I love LGO but it's all the way in Arcadia.  This place is just as good.    We tried the brussel sprout pizza w/pancetta (I was sceptical but it was awesome) and the meatball pizza.  The meatballs here are a 3 meat mixture including veal and schreiners sausage.  It was unbelievable.    Ok, the beer.  Growlers (64oz) of ANY of the drafts are $15 and $10 to refill.  Apparently if you order food to go you get a 50% discount on beer to go which means $5 growler refills.  I'll be coming here quite often.  The beers are diverse and unique.  I picked up a growler of Green Flash IPA (8% ABV) and because they just opened I got it for $10 to start.  Such an awesome deal.  GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW AND TRY IT!!!!!",

The sweet potato pizza is delicious - if you like sweet potatoes, try this pizza. The ricotta on top was creamy and complimented the sweet potatoes wonderfully. The crust was buttery and crispy. The cheese pizza was also excellent - really nice blend of flavors.  I feel like getting things to go is never quite as good as eating them in the restaurant. The pizza was so good even after picking it up and letting it get lukewarm in the car that I'm excited about sitting down in the restaurant and having a full meal. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "The BF and I decided to FINALLY venture over to Federal Pizza for a yummy Friday evening.  I've been waiting to try this place for a while, as I LOVE all the Upward Projects restaurants, and have heard rave reviews about their wine coolers and pizza.  We arrived around 8:30pm and the place was hopping for a Friday night, mid-summer... Always a good sign. The hostess greeted us with a warm smile and informed us that we could wait about 20 minutes or we were welcome to sit immediately at their pizza bar or the main bar. Both were full service so we opted to sit at the main bar, and forego the wait.  As we bellied up, Josh, our friendly bartender sporting a bright colored Hawaiian shirt, was quick to say hello and get us started with some waters while we looked over the menu. After a few moments of sipping on a blueberry hibiscus wine cooler and a draft hef, we quizzed Josh on his favorites and decided to start off with his recommendation of Arancini, delectable Fried Risotto balls, with Herb-Stuffed Parmesan & Mozzarella, finished off with Pomodoro Sauce, a sprinkling of Grana Padano. Normally I'm not a huge risotto fan, but boy oh boy, this was a crisp and flavorful delight.   Next, we decided to order the Meatball pizza sans onions, sub mushrooms. The perfect 12' pizza arrived in a prompt time of 15 minutes, with gooey, bubbling mozzarella and the plethora of toppings. I was particularly excited to read on the menu that the handmade dough they used came from MJ Coe, and if you are familiar with that name, you know it's going to be good, and I was right. Normally I'm a crust tosser, but not this time!   We decided to skip on dessert, however I really want to go back and try out their bombolini, described as \"warm donuts with chocolate dip\"... Umm, yes please!   We finished off with another round of drinks, however I switched from the blueberry hibiscus wine cooler and tried the strawberry rhubarb... Which is now my new favorite drink. It's house made, bubbly and refreshing, even the BF liked it.   Did I mention they have a drive thru as well? Don't feel like dining in? Call it in and pick it up! Definitely coming back to Federal when I'm craving some good pizza and cocktails!",

Interesting, but I should've known that I wouldn't want all of that sweetness. Much more of a beer guy. Speaking of, you must get the Sierra Nevada Hefe. It's one of the best I've ever had.

    "text": "I like eating here. It's good hipster pizza, even if the toppings don't always stay on. Good for individuals, dates, or groups. You probably want to figure on about a pie a person if you're at all hungry. My only real quibble? The music is always too loud, which when it's busy, makes it almost impossible to have a conversation, if you're in to that kinda thing.  I'm personally a huge fan of the buratta and the Manifesto pizza. Dip your crust in their ranch if you're in to that thing. It has a bit of a lemon-dill taste to it that's surprising in a good way :) They also have a great special on Monday and Tuesday nights, and a happy little happy hour.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix! The food is awesome and the staff are always super quick and nice. The hostess usually over estimates how long your wait will be, which I think is a good thing. Last weekend I was told it would be 1 hour, but since someone takes your drink order while you wait, it was no problem. We ended up being sat right when we got our drinks - it couldn't have been more than 20 minutes or so.   The burrata is a must. It pretty much melts in your mouth. What I like most about Federal is how easy they are about subbing and changing their pizzas. Obviously you can make your own, but if you want to sub out things on pre-designed pies, it's no big deal.  I usually go for the manifesto and add an egg on top. If you're into eggs on things it's a must try here. One funny thing is that they don't have hard liquor - only wine and beer. However, they have a selection of house made wine coolers. Grapefruit ginger is perfect for summer.",

They had a wait and we didn't have a lot of time, and our pooch was with us so we were looking for a patio. The Windsor staff suggested we go across the street to Federal as they also have a patio and are a sister restaurant to Windsor. They called and let Federal know that we were coming and Federal had a table ready for us on the patio immediately and even filled up our pooch's dog  bowl with water for us. Nobody else was on the patio (no misters) but our waiter still came out and checked on us enough, and not too much. We shared a Chicken Caesar Salad and a Margarita Pizza which were both super yummy. I definitely judge a place on their Caesar salads. :)  The vibe inside and out at Federal was relaxing even though they were busy. The restaurant was clean - even the bathrooms - even though they were busy and nobody was rushing us - which I really can't stand to be rushed. We will definitely be returning to Federal sometime. Thanks!",

While the food is awesome, the service theory works best when the place is mostly empty and fails when the place is busy.  The have one point person but everyone is suppose to work for your table which causes people to be over served or under served.  I love the concept but it needs to be determined is it the servers or the practice.  Maybe it would be better to split the floor on busy nights having 4 people for half the place and 4 for the other half.  As always the food is awesome.  Oh yeah, as you can see in the pictures, they are very unprofessional and do not make the pizza look as good as it tastes.  I saw a guy in there taking new pictures with no imagination so I take it those pics are going to be even just as or more disappointing.  Do not let them distract you.  The food is fresh and their take on things is awesome.",

I got the pepperoni pizza and chop salad, loved them. My partner ordered the potato pizza, added an egg, and the Cesar salad.

    "text": "Phoenix is lowkey one of the best places In America for good pizza. I've already got a half-dozen exceptional, go-to places throughout the valley, and every time I think the market might be saturated, I make my way into a new parlor that shows me we've still got ground to cover. A lot of the time, when I am going to enjoy a gourmet pizza, I want something that's 'super duper Italian' with imported everything, and crust made with Old World secrets.   Federal Pizza isn't trying to be like that. It's going its own way, and doing a fantastic job.   Ingredients are unique, and to an extent locally sourced. My friend and I split the Manifesto, with generous portions of Schreiner's sausage as well as goat cheese. On the side, we had polenta sticks. I thought these were strange, but with the dipping sauce they came with, I couldn't stop reaching for them! I must also note these pizzas are deceptively heavy, so splitting a pie and an app with a friend is not only reasonable, but surprisingly affordable.  You will be amazed at how low your bill will be as you leave satisfied.   You will be enchanted by the swift, friendly service.   And if you're like me, you're going to leave a little extra happy after seeing the small but legit beer selection.   tl;dr If you like pizza, get in here ASAP.",

    "text": "We went to see my moms Aunt Irene today, but before we did, we decided to grab some lunch here at Federal Pizza.  I had signed up for their email club a few weeks ago and one of the perks of joining is a free pizza!  Score!  When I first walked through the doors, I thought they weren't going to let me in.  I didn't have any facial hair, tattoos, a cool hair style, nice clothes and the fact that I arrived in a car instead of a fixie bike, exposed me even more.  (If you didn't know already, I'm not the biggest fan of hipsters...anyways...this is home base for them).  The hostess was super nice though and showed me and my mom to a booth in the center of the joint.  I ordered a Coke and we showed our waitress my free pizza email on my phone.  She wrote down some number and that was that.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a meatball sandwich to split.  About 10 minutes later, our food had arrived.  Here is how it was.......................  Pepperoni Pizza ($12.00 normally but free with email club signup) -  Simple and delicious.  As per the menu description, \"Molinari Pepperoni + Federal Cheese Blend + Red Sauce\".  The pizza was a little bit \"wet\".  Just a tad soggy in the middle.  You could still pick it up and fold it if you were careful, but it was pretty droopy.  The pepperoni was in large slices and tasted awesome.  I really dug their \"cheese blend\" too.  It was delicious.  Nice and creamy and very flavorful.  The dough/crust  tasted fine except that it was a little bit too soft for my liking.  It was pretty \"bready\".  Overall it was a good, but not great pizza.  Can't complain about a free pizza though.  Would I come back and buy this pizza?  Probably,  but if I am driving somewhere for pizza, there are a few other places I would head to first.  Meatball Sandwich ($10.00) -  This thing was delicious!  As per the menu description, \"Three Meatballs + House Mozz + Pomodoro + Basil + Wood Roasted Onions\".  I really liked this sandwich.  The meatballs were tender, the sauce was delicious, the cheese was melted nicely and the wood fired onions gave it a great \"bite\".  The bread they use is fantastic too.  Not sure if it is their pizza dough or not but whatever it is, it was great.  It was nice and toasty and held together well.  It was served with a little side salad too.  I didn't touch that because I am allergic to vegetables, but I would definitely get this sandwich again.  Service was really friendly.  They weren't around much but they had smiles on their faces and brought me a drink refill without having to ask for it which was cool.    Not sure if I will seek this place out again, but the sandwich was great and the pizza was pretty good.  If I was with some hipster buddies...wait...I don't have any hipster buddies......but if I did, and they wanted to come here, I would probably accompany them and get something to eat.",

The bartender was friendly and made us feel welcomed.  Hands down on the pepperoni pizza.  A 12\" was just enough to get my fix.  We also ordered the chopped salad which was fresh to death!  I'm putting this place in my top 10 pizza joints to eat a pie.  You can't go wrong with the food or the location.    Pizza pie till I die!",

    "text": "We already have a few preferred pizzerias in town, but decided to come here for Italian fare after reading a number of positive reviews on Yelp. During this visit, the long, spacious decor was modern, impressionable, and appropriate for all occasions. There were a mix of families and young professionals seated in-between the full bar and the open kitchen, as the natural sunlight came through the windows to transcend the dim parts of the interior. It was the first day of spring, so the sunny patio was also filled with diners overlooking Central Ave.   For starters, the Polenta arrived perfectly fried to render crispiness on the outside, and creamy and soft at the center. These polenta sticks came with romesco, a creamy nut-red pepper dipping sauce, that added another element to the flavors. By all measures, the profile of the polenta was spot-on and delicious.  The Casonova Pizza ($14.50) was put together with prosciutto, dates, ricotta, arugula and pecorino. The dates and thinly sliced prosciutto were delicious, but unevenly distributed across the pie, prompting these flavors to be a hit and miss. We were impressed by the sweet ricotta to accompany the lightly dressed arugula that covered the pie. However, the thin crust was not charred crispy or elastic enough to extend the wow factor. It was certainly more consequential than our next pie, but also a noticeable letdown noted by one of the previous reviewers. Overall, the Casonova was a lighter and sweeter option than those that are filled with heavy savory toppings, which added a nice contrast to our Manifesto Pizza.  That said, the Manifesto Pizza ($14.50) came with mushrooms, sausages, red sauce, goat cheese, and fennel. The mushrooms did not distinguish in terms of textures or taste, but the superiority of the sausage and the red sauce were unsurpassed. Unfortunately, we find the thin crust to be inconsistent in-between the pies, and a major weak link in the meal. The texture of the crust was not well executed, which steered our attention to the high quality toppings and ingredients instead of the whole pie.   Service was exceptionally attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Every server and chef greeted us by making good eye contact with a warm smile. Our water was refilled consistently, and multiple servers came by to check on us throughout the visit. Our chef, Jesse, was so nice that he made a personalized pizza for one of our young dining companions. Their level of enthusiasm to attend to our needs was another major highlight in our visit. Interested diners can expect high quality ingredients, 5-star service, and a fantastic dining environment. 3.5 stars for the overall experience. We are definitely adding this pizzeria to the rotation as we look forward to trying their sweet potato pizza, meatball sandwich, homemade ravioli, and desserts.",

Who likes warm beer??!  We started off with a chopped salad (which they separated in two bowls) and Arancini (fried risotto balls). Both were yummy and definitely would order the arancini again.  We couldn't decide on which kind of pizza to get and was split between 4. The waitress gave us the option of getting all 4 different styles in two 12 inch pizza. Score! We got the at last, casanova, manifesto, and Brussel sprouts pizza. Yes we were starving. They were all surprisingly good. My favorite was the Casanova because of the subtle sweetness to it from the dates. Of course we ended up taking it home because our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs.  We topped off dinner with a berry cobbler topped with Madagascar vanilla ice cream. Wasn't my favorite but my husband liked it.  I would definitely come here again for their pizza.",

That's $5 for what would likely cost you up to $16 in other places.    2) The lunch special for $10.50  is the real deal.  1/2 size football shaped pizza, and a 1/2 sized salad portion.  All the pizzas and salads have been decent to great.  3) Very cool laid back modern vibe in a nice part of town.  Fine for anything from a date to a family meal to a business lunch.  They do it right.  4) If you like veggies, the $13.50 veggie appetizer is enough for a light taste for 4, or hearty taste for 2.  Always a family favorite way to start in a healthy way.",

I was recommended by several other restaurant owners to try the pizza obviously and the pasta.   So we did exactly that, ordered the Big Star and Mickey White.  Big Star, think supreme pizza, it's got everything and everything works. I think it could've used a few seconds more in the oven to get the bottom slightly more crunchy to keep all those yummy toppings from falling off.   Mickey White, I just had to try something that had \"porcini dusted chicken\". Perfect pasta coated in a velvety salty cheese sauce.  Also drinks are pretty cheap and they got a nice menu, I used the flight to gage what I liked first.",

They take a unique and different approach to pizza that's definitely got hipster written all over it, and execute with an amazing red sauce and pizza crust that are beyond addicting.   This is a medium-sized, diner modernized on the inside with the retro drive thru on the outside, that was full of cars when I came in (definitely a good sign of good food). The menu offers several pizzas, appetizers, salads, and other plates.   We had the Manifesto, which was a pizza with Mushrooms, Sausage, Red Sauce, Goat Cheese and Fennel, we also ordered a Cesar Salad, peach cobbler and coffee. The pizza needs no further explanation other than amazing, the Cesar was okay- the dressing was too thin in my opinion, the peach cobbler was fresh- no complaints here, and the coffee was mediocre.   They didn't hit it out of the ball park on everything, but the pizza is enough to bring me back!",

Given the name it is know for the pizza however I did not think it was anything spectacular unfortunately especially given the fact I love the two restaurants I spoke about earlier. Also the service was not too good I hate giving mediocre reviews and some people may disagree but I have been to an abundance of places and just think their are many better options. The one plus though is they have the same wine as postinos.",

I arrived around 5:40 pm and there was already a bit of a crowd going, but luckily we only had to wait 5 min for a table for two!! Aka yay!!    In terms of food, I got the \"at last\" pizza which had broccolini, roasted corn, goat cheese, calabrian chili, basil, and lemon zest and my friend got the patata bianca (fingerling potatoes, citrus ricotta, pecorino, rosemary infused EVOO, crispy proscuitto). We also shared the garganelli pasta and the crispy fingerlings. All I can say is everything I tasted was incredible!! The fingerlings were crispy, flavorful, and definitely worth every bit of the $6 price tag. My pizza was delicious and all the ingredients really went well together and didn't seem to overwhelm the base. The pasta was seriously one of the best I have ever had at a restaurant -- unique flavor combination with the perfect al dente pasta. The food was stellar across the board and I literally want to go back asap so I can try more menu items.  There is parking behind the building and on the side of the building but it seems to fill up quite quickly, esp since there are other restaurants right next to it. There is also valet parking if you're interested in that!  Service was prompt and friendly and made the whole experience great! Overall, such a good dining option in PHX!",

My gluten-free margarita pizza took a bit longer to bake than the rest of my party but they made sure to cook my pizza in a separate area of the oven that was away from the traces of gluten. My large party went during Happy Hour and their choices of beverages were delicious. They make refreshing coolers that are awesome to drink on a hot summer day. My friends ate the pastas and pizzas and they all highly recommend this restaurant.   I will be returning soon for Happy Hour",

My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after a recommendation from a friend who enjoyed both the pizza and pasta options.  We arrived around 7:45 on a Sunday evening and had no wait before being seated. We were especially hungry so we ordered the loaded Brussels sprouts to start. The Brussels sprouts were roasted well: charred but not mushy from being over cooked. The bacon added some needed flavor. My boyfriend also enjoyed the lemon herb aioli it came with. For pizza, we ordered the meatball pizza and half chef's whim half big star. I was absolutely impressed by the pizza dough - it reminded me of pizza from Naples! The bottom was thin but the crust had such a nice flavor and chewiness. My favorite was the meatball pizza. The meatballs tasted delicious and there was just the right amount of toppings. The basil added a little freshness and the onions added a little extra bite. The chef's whim was recommended by our waiter, but out of the three we tried, it was our least favorite. While the flavors were interesting, they did not meld in the most pleasant way. The garlic oil, cheese, and lemon were base flavors on which they added green apple, Gorgonzola, and pecans. I did not think all the flavors went together. We also tried the big star, which was very flavorful. Instead of olives and mushrooms, we got corn. The pizza tasted good because who can go wrong with bell peppers, onion, sausage, and pepperoni on a pizza? I will have to come back for their Monday and Tuesday deal!",

The staff was friendly, and the restaurant was gorgeous. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a sausage and basil pizza with the donuts with chocolate dipping sauce for dessert. This was more than enough to feed a family of two adults and two children. Everything was fresh and delicious. The pizza was unique enough the adults could really enjoy it, but nothing so crazy that the kids wouldn't eat it.  Here's the deal, I eat more Little Caesars pizza then any 41-year-old woman should... And that's not because I can't spring for the good stuff. It's that too often the good stuff has fennel sausage, or goat cheese, or other weird green stuff my kids start to pick off but then refuse to eat anyway. The only thing worse than spending $40 on fancy pizza is watching your kids pick a part and lick half of it and then not even eat it!  Our entire bill was under $40 which was more than reasonable for the amount that we got and how fresh the food was. I can't wait to come back  on a date night with my husband.  Last thing, there is also a drive-through pick up area. After we placed our order we were able to go out and wait in the car, and the young man who took our order brought our food out to us. Super convenient. Forgot to ask for plastic cutlery or paper plates, so I'm not sure if that would've been an option. But that one's on me, and luckily we were on staycation, so we gathered around the box like a campfire and made it work with no problem :-)",

    "text": "THIS IS THE EXACT COMPLAINT I FILED WITH THE BBB:  Sunday, June 30th, 2013, my boyfriend picked up our favorite pizza in the valley to eat for an early lunch, the Federal.  Immediately after eating we were both feeling a little off, slight stomach pains, a little bloated but no biggie.  We thought maybe we had over eaten.  By 8:00pm that night I ended up on the floor of my house vomiting profusely into a bowl as I could not reach the bathroom the food poisoning was so severe.    July 1, 2013, I woke up to severe dehydration, and with severe muscle and kidney pain from the extensive vomiting and other lovely experiences I had the entire night.  Unfortunately, my body had gone into such a state of dehydration, that it began to halt the function of my organs. Namely, my esophagus, my lungs, my muscles and my bladder.  Unable to walk, my boyfriend carried me to his truck and sped like a maniac to the hospital.  Arriving at the hospital, the Drs did an MRI and did not like the sound of my heart and I ended up staying in the hospital getting bags upon bags of saline to aid in my severe dehydration.   After a $300 ER bill, two missed days of work for my boyfriend (he was sick too but less so) and three missed days of work for myself, I decided to email the Federal, July 7th, 2013, after recuperating for a week.  I did not ask for compensation, I was not rude or out of line. I wrote the email coming from a concerned patron that feels that something should be done to avoid this ever happening in the future.   What I got was an email back (July 12, 2013) from a Craig Demarco, an owner of Upward Projects, who vilely requested that we handle this matter over the phone.  No problem, I understand that you do not want anything in writing for me to use against you.  Even though I expressly stated I was not out to get them, I was out to incite a change in how the restaurant serves its food.  I agreed to do so and handed over my phone number and gave some times that we could talk, and said if those times didn't work, we should coordinate a better time.   It is officially one week later (July, 19th, 2013) and no response.  Not a call, not an email, not a care. This expresses a complete lack of decorum and respect for the diners that come in to the Federal, and I cannot be less impressed with their actions.  I am disgusted with how this has been handled and really do thank them for really exhibiting how they handle delicate matters such as this.  By not handling them at all.  Update: June 19, 2014 - Nobody from this restaurant or any of the owners have contacted me about my experience.  Still no love.",

Their pizza crust isn't too thick and we love their unique topping options. The federal chop salad and the classic caesar salad are our go to options.  We have a toddler so we tend to go around lunch on the weekends or the occasional evening and we have never had a long wait. The staff is friendly but it can be slightly slow at times, but not slow enough that deters us from going back time and time again. Another splendid restaurant from the Upward Projects team.",

They have an awesome selection of pizza's you can choice from.  So, far I have had the Meatball, Big Star, Brussels Sprout and Manifesto.    The Meatball is my favorite pizza; if you add Brussels sprouts to the pizza it's even better.   Even the staff is awesome too; they make you feel like you are only one in the restaurant.  Your water glass is always filled and the pizza comes out quick too.    It may be in central phoenix, but it is totally worth the drive.  Federal Pizza is a locally owned company.  They are part of the Upward Projects; all of their other restaurants are great too.   So, if you have not tried Federal Pizza.  Then you are totally missing out.",

You can get either 2 pizzas + 1 pitcher of beer (or something like that) or one pizza and a bottle of wine for $20. And the waitress was like, \"Get the most expensive wine for the best deal.\" So I did.  Just go. It's not too loud, not too quiet. On a steamy evening July it was a little warm inside (that's what she...never mind.). But who cares.  I'm going to have to go back and back to try the rest of the menu. Oh, and I got the margherita pizza. Everything about it was perfect. I can taste the delish dough in my watering mouth right now.  Oh, there's a drive-through!",

    "text": "No need to add to the raves about the food, but I wanted to speak up about the great service we got last night at Federal. It was a Friday night and we had reservations for 5 people at 7pm.   We only had one of our party there by 7, and they seated him without giving him any pushback about needing the whole party there. Three more of us arrived by 7:30,and the last person was there by 8. Not once did anyone give us trouble about monopolozing a table, and they even let the last person order her pizza when she arrived.   The dinner was a going-away celebration for a very good friend who has had a very rough time lately, and it was a much-needed send-off for all of us.   Thanks, FP, for recognizing that we are going to spend money at your establishment even if we're a little late. Sometimes planes don't arrive on time, trucks don't get packed as quickly as we intend, and emotions run high when you're picking up your life and moving across the country. Thanks for helping us relax at the end of a hard day.",

Being from NYC, I'm hard to please when it comes to pizza...and this place definitely exceeds my expectations. My favorite: the Casanova Pizza (prosciutto, dates, ricotta, augula, and pecorino). Needless to say, it's sweet and salty perfection. The decor is retro trendy. If you're into antiques, check out the beautiful lamps from the 50's, 60's and 70's.   Overall, everything about FP is five stars. If you have a Yelp list like I do, this should be at the very top.  Oh, and they have Drive Thru Take Out...just call ahead!",

Our server was very friendly and brought our iced tea, it was passion not plain,  i guess that is all they have, it was good. I got the 1/2 pizza and salad for $10.50- chopped salad and a pizza  with sausage, peppers, mushrooms,  olives, etc. I was asked if I wanted grated parmesan, i said Yes! I got 2 quick grates and she was gone- a little more would be perfect. .. she held the cheese in her bare hand, which I think would be against  health code. The pizza  was good as was the salad except  that there was blue cheese in it! Many people wouldn't  mind, for me, it is a problem,  I  am allergic! ! I had already taken a bite into a chunk and swallowed,  not to spit on my plate or cloth napkin, which is what I should have done because I have been on meds since and I have spent all morning  in bed today! It was NOT supposed to be in the salad, i double checked,  so that is just a sloppy kitchen, where things are carelessly  handled and food made! I told the server, but no response  was forthcoming, most restaurants would have a manager  talk to you. Between  that snd the fact that they are owned by Postino, I will never go back because  I  produce  a charity benefit for homeless  veterans  every year. I went to Posting Arcadia  and asked for a donation for the raffle,  they told me to come back, I did, they said  no. I do all of this on my own time and gas!. So, when other businesses  in the area support the benefit taking place in their neighborhood  to raise money for AZ StandDown /homeless veterans,  like The Vig. Teepee Mexican, Z Greek and more... but places like Postino, Beckett ' s Table and Acacia don't,  I  feel I must support  the places that feel veterans are important  and their customers  being sick from their sloppy and careless handling of the food means something  to them!!!",

Portion was huge and took slightly less than half home.  Got to try all three desserts - I'm not a pudding fan so I won't comment on that particular one.  The doughnuts were HOT and soft inside like a pretzel.  Cobbler is normally not a fave of mine, but I could tell the berries were fresh.  Pleasantly surprised.   Heard rave reviews at the table about the lasagna, but portion size was a little skimpy.  Also heard on past visits by others at the table that the pizza is phenomenal.  Will try next time!  This brings me to my last point: service here was excellent.  Genuinely friendly and overall great job.  Only reason I don't five star it is they never brought my side salad.  (Also no bread.  Pasta and no bread?)  Forgot to check the bill.  Hopefully it was left off.    Make your way to this place if you've never been!  Great ambiance and a relaxed crowd with a little wait for a table by dinner time.",

They did a really nice job with the layout and decor, an all around inviting atmosphere.  We ate light and shared the seasonal salad and their margarita pizza adding roasted garlic and prosciutto.  The salad was a nice mix of greens and other veggies with goat cheese and avocado, everything very crisp & fresh, a nice size for one person, but we managed to make it do for two.  The pizza was wonderfully tasty with large slices of ripe beefsteak-like tomatoes that tasted like they came right out an east coast garden, and the prosciutto added just the right amount of salt and meat to make it virtually perfect.  It might have been able to stay in the oven another minute, but I'm NOT complaining!  The crust was almost perfectly crisp, and I could have licked the olive oil off the pan for dessert!  We're now fans and will be back again.",

My Hubby and I have been here multiple times, with friends, family and by ourselves -every time we've visited, we've been happy with the service, speed and of course, the  pizza.   Now if you're looking for the best-of-the-best, real Italian, Napoli style pizza - this isn't it. Their pizzas are 'different' - they take your average pizza, and put a fun, different spin on it (ex. Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta and Manchego cheese!). The only thing that I don't absolutely love, it their pizza crust - it just isn't everything I think it could be. It lacks that rustic, toasty, bubbly, crust. But hey, overall, their pizzas are still VERY very yummy. For this, I give them 4 stars.  Appetizers you MUST try: 1) Burrata - Wow is their burrata yummy! It makes my mouth water just thinking about it. They make tthe cheese in-house, so it's super fresh and gooey. They drizzle it with good quality olive oil, sprinkle it with fresh sea salt, and serve it with crispy crostini.  Best Salad: TLC  Pizzas you MUST try: 1) Sweet Potato 2) Casanova 3) Brussel Sprout  4) Big Star  Best Desert : Bombolini!",

Since they only sell 12\" pizzas we decided to forego any appetizers and decided on two Pepperoni pizzas. The service was good, I like how they do team service. A few different waiters/waitresses came by to address our needs and to bring us drinks. One waitress would say do you guys need more drinks and then a totally different person would come by with our drinks. The Pizza itself was pretty good. I was a big fan of the giant pepperoni slices that cover the entire pizza. The sauce was ok, but the thing that endeared me to this pizza is the crust. The brick oven does wonders for it. It was crispy with some slight burnt spots on the outside (which I like) and the inside was nice and delicious. All in all this is a solid pizza spot.",

Our drinks were empty the entire meal and when we asked for a to go box the waitress dumped all our pizza crust in the box after I told her not to.

I would rather eat pizza out of a trashcan than go back to federal pizza.",

Called 45 minutes ahead for a good 'za to take home for movie night, waited until they told me it would be ready and here I sit. The pizza finally comes with appropriate apologies. Can't argue about the quality of the pie: Schreiner's sausage, tasty mushrooms, MJ crust  - all good - but it's a pizza.  You shouldn't have to wait at the pickup window longer than it takes to make the pizza from scratch.   Even the best food tastes bitter after a bad experience with service.",

The atmosphere was great and staff was friendly, but service was a tad slow. We were in no hurry so it wasn't that big a deal to us. All in all a great place to add to the rotation, I will be back.",

We call on Federal Pizza frequently if we don't feel like driving more than a few minutes for a good pizza night.  As expected, the vibe and service are top notch.  While Cibo and The Parlor still top my pizza list, I truly have no bad things to say of Federal's menu.  Get the roasted veggie board for a healthy appetizer like you've never tried before.  If the weather plays nice, grab a table on the patio and a few of their homemade wine coolers to share (but be careful, some can be way too sweet).  Take a walk down toward Practical Art to burn off that pizza crust after dinner!",

    "text": "As a long time fan of Postino and Windsor, when my best foodie friend sent me a reminder about the opening of Federal Pizza, we promptly scheduled our next Girls' Night for dinner there.  We had a bit of a wait, but there was adequate seating by the parking area, so it wasn't a big deal.  We were shown to our table on the patio to enjoy the wonderful October weather.  We decided to split a pitcher of Pilsner Urquell (although they have many great choices, including cans of Big Sky Moose Drool) and the burrata appetizer.  Our waitress was sweet and checked on us regularly without seeming pushy.  The pitcher soon arrived, quickly followed by the burrata.  The grilled bread had a great charred flavor and a soft interior, it was probably our favorite part of the dish.  Although the burrata had a great texture and was definitely fresh, we felt it could have benefitted from a bit of a flavor boost, such as a hit of lemon zest, some basil or a nice spicy Calabrian style chili olive oil.  The menu states the burrata comes with olive oil and sea salt, but for some reason, these taste elements seemed to be missing from our portion.  Overall a B for this appetizer.  The quality of the ingredients was definitely there, but the flavor profile was just a bit MEH.  After a few minutes, our waitress stopped by to see if we were ready to proceed with ordering more food.  We were, and asked to share the wedge salad and the brussels sprout pizza.  There was a bit of confusion, I probably didn't specify the brussels sprout  pizza, so the waitress put in our order for the brussels sprout side dish.  Our wedge salad arrived, the kitchen was kind enough to split the salad to ensure we each got our share of all the tasty gorgonzola, dates and Schreiner's bacon.  The salad nicely hit all the flavors, with very fresh lettuce and ripe cherry tomatoes to boot.  Then, another server brought our brussels sprout side dish.  OOPS.... no big deal, we clarified we had wanted the brussels sprout pizza.  They were quick to rectify this tiny mistake, with a manager stopping by to let us know the pizza was on them for the error.  Wow, that's the kind of service we know and love from all the Uptown Projects restaurants!  Completely unnecessary to comp the pizza for the confusion, but a very nice touch and greatly appreciated.  The pizza arrived a few minutes later.  The crust was completely different than other popular Phoenix area thin crust wood-fired pizza havens, not the best, but definitely not the worst.  The toppings were what put this pizza over the top for both of us.  We are both huge fans of brussels sprouts, especially when they are roasted and crispy.  Add salty pancetta bits, some garlic love, melty manchego cheese and top it all off with some lemon zest to brighten the whole flavor profile, and this pizza is definitely a winner.  I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars, as Federal is better than a 4 star, but not quite to the perfection of a 5 star.  I will definitely visit again and try some of the other interesting sounding pizza combos on their menu.",

I sped right thru the first time not seeing the actual drivethru, but the gal was nice enough to open the sliding door during my second pass so I could see that I was in the right place.  The $20 will get you any bottle of their wines also served by the glass, and any pizza.  They have a great wine selection (a lot of the same as Postis) so I stuck with my summer jam which is always the Ca Del Sarto pinot grigio, crisp and refreshing in this heat, and tried the Big Star pizza which I worried would be a little busy but was really well done!  I learned a little trick when doing take out pizza - I put about 4 slices in a pan on the stove set over medium low heat while I open the wine and prepare a salad accompaniment.  This really makes the pizza crisp up, and you get to have it nice and hot at your convenience.  I foresee never cooking again on Mondays.",

The smiley host sat us on the patio at my request and we were promptly greeted with water and out menus.  The waiter was friendly, he told us about the special  gave us a few minutes to look the extensive not- the- run- of- the -mill menu over .... then took our order.  I ordered the Brussels sprout Pizza and TLC salad. They offer a 1/2 a pizza and 1/2 salad for lunch for $9.95. My guest ordered Big star pizza and Federal Chop.  The food came out quickly served on pizza trays, it was kinda unusual but it definitely worked. My salad was out of this world. Seriously the best salad I've ever had. I love fresh slivered fennel and it was just the right amount. My crazy Brussel sprout pizza was delish! So yummy. I can't wait to go back  again and again so I can conquer everything on this menu! Oh and my guest enjoyed her meal too, she always does, she visits Federal a few times a month, easy for her she lives in the area, I live in Scottsdale. It's worth the trip. Next time....The Manifesto pizza, Wedge Salad and I've gotta try the Mister Mister for an appetizer! Whooo Hooooo finally something good, obviously I've got to get out of scottsdale more!",

My Labor Day weekend vacay to visit friends in Arizona was basically a gigantic tour of all the wonderful food that Phoenix has to offer. They definitely knew how to sell their city.   So, here we have Federal Pizza, a place that seems to have floated into a Portland Portal and ended up here. Part of a grouping of amazing restaurants all owned by the same people, Federal Pizza definitely brings something different to the table. Unique. Affordable (like everything in this state). Comfortable setting. Gender neutral bathrooms. Staff with tattoos everywhere. Killer food and drinks made from scratch. Perfect vibe.   There were two awesome Must Taste Items on the menu:  1. Homemade \"Wine Coolers,\" in several flavors. I tried the apple cider and strawberry rhubarb. Had a hard time choosing which one was better. Mmmm.   2. PIZZA. Very VERY Mod Friendly Pizza. We did a meatball pizza with sliced POTATOES and CORN, and a veggie pizza with onions, garlic, and ROASTED brussels sprouts.   You basically choose everything on it, kind of like the blaze/blast/pieology craze we have here in Sac, BUT it has thicker, delicious crust and is slow baked the regular way.  One of the best pizza experiences I've ever had, and I've had me a lot of pizza experiences.  Freakin' Phoenix!",

Everything is so fresh and delicious and never disappoints. The pizza dough is so light and wood fired to perfection. We once saw a man seated next to us at the bar with a plate full of pizza crusts he didn't eat, which was so surprising to us because the crust is the best part. Sandwiches are great too.

Everyone was friendly so big plus on the service side. I had the \"great little salad\" and \"at last\" pizza. Both were very good, so I'm looking forward to returning and trying some of their other offerings.  It has a hip vibe to it, with semi dim lights and loud music, so overall I'd recommend it as a good place to meet up with friends.",

They have the best marinara sauce (hands down), unique pizza combinations, happy hour drink prices, and always a delicious seasonal salad! All pitchers of beers, glasses of wine, and wine coolers are $5 before 5pm! Upward projects even has their own wine made specifically for their restaurants! I highly recommend the Downtown Red blend!!!  I hope you enjoy their fabulous crew and food as much as I do!!!",

    "text": "Okay, so the food was absolutely fan-freakin-tastic but wow, service was a bit of an upset.    It all started a week ago when I talked to the nice manager about wanting to make reservations for a table of 14.  None of us has been here before and we were very excited to give this place a try.  After being told that reservations were booked from 5-9PM, I was kindly told that had if I had at least half my party here, a table *should* be opened up.  He was nice and professional and it's understandable that hey, Saturdays are a busy night.  What I didn't plan on was that when we arrived on Saturday and being told that wait time was an hour, we were actually going to wait almost two hours for two SEPARATE tables.    What?  I get that you can't predict precisely on table turn-over times but if we're going to wait almost double the expected time, I'd assume we'll be sitting together at one table.  If we were going to be split apart, why did so many people that came after us get seated before us?  Wow.  We had asked our hostess if we can move our patio tables ourselves so we can sit together but she gave us a wishy washy answer, leaning more towards no, whereas the gentleman working said it was fine for us to move the tables.  Lost in communication much?  By then, it wasn't worth the battle as it was close to two hours by that point and we were all starving.  Two awkwardly separated tables it is.    Our waitress made a few errors with drinks but she was nice about it.  The wait on the food was also a whole other ordeal with one table getting food 20 mins before the other table which made them have to wait awkwardly on us while we finished so we can all get ice cream across the street afterwards.  So yes, while the food was tasty, fresh, and the char crust was amazing and their homemade grapefruit and mint wine cooler was crisp and refreshing, the whole waiting and seating fiasco left a bad taste in my mouth.   Would I be back?  Maybe.  We all have our off-days and the beets side dish and The Answer [Spicy sausage, apple, Gorgonzola, spinach, candied pecans, and fennel] were pretty delish!    This place definitely is definitely more suited for smaller parties.  Be warned!",

    "text": "Finally had the chance to take the family and some close friends and check this place out for lunch. It's been on my list of new places to try out for a long time. Not to mention we had a $50 gift that was screaming to be used up.  This location is a masterfully transferred old federal bank building that used to do business here in another lifetime. It has everything from the old drive thru to the super old metal covered parking area for the previous bank employees.  Inside is themed with the current hipster vibe and they did a great job exploring ways to make both the decor and the food interesting and great tasting at the same time.  We started with several appetizers and decided to share most the food. Ordered the F&A Veg Board, the Wedge Salad and two plates of the Arancini. They were all very delicious and left us in the mood for some main entrees.  Next we decided on the Lamb Bolognese, a Big Star Pizza, a Meatball Pizza and a Casanova Pizza. Everything was very good and we really enjoyed all the fresh ingredients. Even the grand kids did a great job of polishing off their portions.  The pizzas were also tasty but the dough and crust were not anything special and different than what we were used to eating. We all generally agreed that we preferred more of a Chicago or NY style pizza crust during our drive back home.  Service was friendly and the food came out hot and ready to eat. We did have a small problem trying to talk over the loud music. My wife even ask them to turn it down a little bit and had no luck. The music was so loud in the bathroom that I started having psychedelic flashbacks from my college days. Nice!  Overall we had a fun time and would most likely go back again. Get your buns over here and show this place your dance moves. They also have a large selection of spirits and other alcoholic beverages that you can enjoy. Maybe the loud music is more appealing when you are three sheets to the wind? BEER ME!  3.75 STARS",

Light and fluffy while still being crispy..if that makes any sense. Coming from a True pizza snob...this place is legit. I don't know how I got so lucky to only pay $10.50 for a personal sized serving and a blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. Also had the polenta sticks that were out of this world good. This place is nestled in the cutest area of central Phoenix surrounded by beautiful trees and open windows. It's in an area with other super cool and modern restaurants.

Basically, the drive through is an area where you can drive and they had a door into which you can enter the restaurant after turning the engine of your car off. Basically, it makes sense because people should be getting their food in the order in which they arrive. Luckily I didn't get stuck behind anyone. Also, if the restaurant was busy and all of the parking spots were full, then doing take out would be convenient and quick.  I went into the door and after a minute someone came up to me and asked me if I needed help. I told her that I was there for take out. The process was quick and simple. I really liked how efficient the take out process was.  As for the pizza itself, I liked how the crust was crunchy and it had varied flavors on top. I also liked that there was no burn, char, or carbon on the bottom of the pizza crust. The pizza had schreiner's sausage, molanari pepperoni, red and yellow bell pepper, mushrooms, red sauce, olives and wood roasted onions for $16.",

On Monday's and Tuesdays after 8pm, they have a bottle of wine and pizza special for $20.  So, we started with an appetizer and went with the wings, we did the 15 count because then you can try 3 sauces. I loved the honey hot the most, Buffalo was also delicious... I wasn't as much a fan of the golden one, which I think he said is similar to a Carolina bbq. Which honestly was good, but I'm not a super mustardy person. Just a preference. Someone who likes mustard would probably love it. Then for pizza we did the Casanova and at last. My friend loved the at last and Casanova was my favorite. Overall, was just a great experience.

First, there wasn't a ton of pizza options which was kinda disappointing. We settled on the Hawaiian pizza. It was a bummer. The crust was so thin it couldn't support any of the toppings. None of it had much flavor. When I picked up slices everything would fall right off including the cheese. It was also surprisingly greasy. The service was pretty good which was the one redeeming factor. I do not however think I will be back.",

    "text": "This place is hands down awesome.  Monday and Tuesday nights you have to stop in at 8pm to grab your pizza and house bottle of wine (your choosing of course) for only $20. If you're not a wine drinker then swap it for 2 pitchers of beer.   What I enjoy most about Federal:  -Loaded Brussels every dang time! Minus the bacon...duh. Also don't forget to ask for these babies extra grilled because who doesn't love char marks?! -Seasonal salad...doesn't matter the season it's always fulfilling -Margherita Pizza..with RED SAUCE!! If you don't ask you won't get it. And trust me you'll be sorry.  -The offer Gluten Free pizza from Jewels Bakery #winning -QU.ALE, Redwood Alley & Stagedive are fantastic wine offerings -Handmade Wine Coolers for those summer nights. Get the Grapefruit Ginger, Watermelon Mint or Blueberry Hibiscus.    Things of tried and were \"meh\" about:  -At Last Pizza, I was thrilled to try this pizza because it had so many things I love: basil, lemon zest, roasted corn and several others. However you know when they say \"less is more\" well it's very fitting for this pizza. It was flavor overload and not in a good way. The lemon zest with the goat cheese  is too much plus the chili's. I don't know...it just didn't work for me.   -Sweet Potato Pizza, super filling and rich (not a bad thing). The only thing I didn't like about this pizza was the sage.  -Kids Sketti + Meatball. For a kids items I would expect the flavor to come from the meat ball with a basic more simplified marinara sauce. This however had a bit of a kick to it and a touch too much of pepper. My daughter wouldn't eat it and stuck with the solo meatball.   Other notes: -Casanova, friends love this pizza because of the sweet and savory combination of the dates and prosciutto.   -Big Star, for all those meat eaters that have a big appetite. #nomnom  -Wings, my partner has to get wings if they're on the menu. He tried these and immediately was in heaven with the honey hot. Icing on the top was the fresh carrot and celery sticks with buttermilk ranch for dipping.",

I had a kale salad, and I enjoyed a sweet potato pizza which was interestingly tasty.  I would say that though the food and the service were great, the highlight for me was the hostess, Stoney. She tried to ensure my first visit to Federal would not disappoint. She offered us an opportunity to sit at the pizza bar which is kind of fun, and she came back around while we were eating just to ask how my first time experience was going.   I do not own a restaurant, but if I did, she is the kind of individual I would want representing my brand. Bravo, Stoney!",

Our server was very personable, accomdating,  and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.  We decided to go with the lunch special.  The lunch special consisted of 1/2 size salad and 1/2 size pizza for $10.50, it was just the right amount to satisfy.  The pizza was delicious. There wasn't a crumb left.

I will say that I generally modify orders via adding chicken to pizzas, etc and the expense per visit it high. All things considered, this place is the best pizza & wings Ive had in Arizona.   The venue is gorgeous, the hours are fantastic for AZ, and the location is great. I crave the Big Star w/ Chicken weekly...  Considerations: The service heavily varies as some staff seem to be more attentive than others. The QC is a little shaky as seen with variations with the Manifesto Pizza and some wing recipes depending on visits.",

The pizza crust was very soft with a sweetness that was a kin to eating wonder bread. It was very easy to eat a whole pizza which isn't something I can always do. The sauce was delicious with a very high quality tomato base and very simple in a good way. Cheese was of excellent quality also.   Next time I go back I will definitely get a side of sauce to dip the awesome crust in.",

If you dine in on Monday or Tuesday they have a special for one pizza and either a bottle or wine or two pitches of beer for $20 bucks. They have a great patio as well with misters.   I ordered the wings and they allow you to do several sauces! I did traditional and then a honey mustard type sauce. They were great and the ranch wasn't out of a bottle! Nothing makes me more sad then that!   For people that don't want to eat there they have an awesome drive thru for you to come and get pizza to go!",

Place: it's nice place and have enough space for parking.   Service: All if the staff were very nice and helpful, we were very picky with some stuff when we order and make some changes in the orders and they were very nice and polite and made it happen without any problems.   Prices: it's fair prices, the food is worth the money that you give for which is very fair.   I recommend this restaurant, and I'll be back for sure.",

Parking lot was full and I didn't want to valet so I parked across the street near Windsor/Churn. We ordered the Pineapple Express pizza (because we are heathens and enjoy pineapple on pizza). It was fantastic! A nice sweet sauce and a pretty decently sized Neapolitan style pizza. We also ordered the brussel sprouts to start, which I was less impressed with. They were a bit tough and could have been cooked a bit more.   We will definitely stop by again, as it was an enjoyable time.",

    "text": "Is this good pizza? Is this great pizza? Could it possibly be superb pizza? Nope, this is quite honestly the melt-in-your-mouth, gobble up every bite, ditch the diet type of pizza and I'm completely sold!   I came here for the first time on a blustery, windy and rainy day. After jumping through raindrops, I stepped foot inside and was immediately welcomed by a scent of pizza dough baking in the oven while warm air welcomed my cold toes. They seated me in a cozy table that allowed a visual of both the restaurant and the kitchen, so I was able to see the action come alive!   After looking at the menu, my lunch guest and I decided to share the Big Star pizza and the Chicken Panzanella. Both were spectacular! The Big Star pizza had a perfectly baked crust that was the ideal blend of chewy and crunchy. Layers of cheese, olives, peppers, pepperoni and sausage topped the pizza crust. It's the kind of pizza that makes you sneak a second and third piece on your plate. It's the kind of pizza that makes you forget about the wedding dress you have to fit into in two months. It's just that good! The salad was also delicious but obviously didn't compare to the pizza. However, it did fill me up so that I stopped myself from consuming yet another piece of the pizza! The chicken on the salad is grilled which gives it a smoky flavor and the vegetables add a nice flavor. All I can say is that the Postinos/Windsor family have done it yet again! They are really making the Camelback and Central corridor a foodie's delight!   One other item I'd like to note: Are you a beer drinker? Not only do they have a detailed selection of craft beer, but they also sell growlers that you can take home with you. If you pick up food to-go, you can fill a growler for half price. Not a bad deal if you ask me!",

The Casanova has prosciutto, ricotta, dates, and fresh arugula combining sweet, salty, and a tad of spice from the arugula making for an awesome flavor combo. Love love love it. I always enjoying hearing the chef's whim which is a random pizza concoction that the chef thinks up for that day--always different, always delicious.   When just going for a snack the polenta is tasty and comes in fried little sticks with a dipping sauce, and only $4.   Federal has a great draft beer selection and as the other Upward Projects restaurants offers it's before 5pm specials... This time wine, draft beer, or in-house made wine coolers.  Wonderful place to kick back on the patio and enjoy life :)",

The olives were excellent and had a touch of sea salt.  The five star pizza had sausage, pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms, and onions.  It had tons of flavor and the crust was excellent.  The manifesto had goat cheese, sausage, fennel, and mushrooms and was just as good and savory.  The goat cheese put it over the top.  The price was spot on.  Worked out to be 50 bucks with drinks.  I would have given it five stars but the table was wet, the waitress brought me a frozen glass for my sculpin ipa (alcohol abuse), and they didnt take discover card.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to others.  Well executed food and nice spot to visit.  Well done.",

We also got the house chopped salad that came with prosciutto, cappicola, provolone, peppers onions and a great vinaigrette ($10) and one of the best salads I've ever had! We also got the meatball pizza ($14) that was just amazing. I couldn't believe how perfect the crust was, and this was TAKEOUT! I can only imagine how good it is in house and super fresh.

The hostess came and apologized and offered us a couple drinks on the house, which was appreciated.  Our waiter came and took our order, but we didn't see him again until he brought the check.  No one asked how our food was.  The food, however, was great.  I had wanted to try this place for a while because I had heard good things.  We tried the Manifesto and the Casanova pizzas, I would recommend them both.",

Not helpful explaining the various IPA beers. Seemed frustrated by our questions.   Finally seated.  It was sonority inside with really bad music that we hoped sitting outside would be better. Only minimally. Not sure how anyone can carry on a conversation in this place!  Pizzas were ok. Had heard about the Brussels sprout pizza so tried it. Hardly any sprouts on the pie. Very unimpressed. Never had water refills.   Won't be back. Way better places to spend our time and money in in this city of great pizza joints.",

So far, I've been happy with the direction that Phx restaurants are taking and I really enjoyed Federal Pizza.  A friend and I visited this weekend and we had the burrata appetizer and the Big Red pizza. Both were amazingly good. They had a great selection of local and craft beers and a good wine list. We didn't have dessert b/c we were full, but I certainly would like to try some of what they had on the menu.  They are down a star for one reason - OPEN TABLE - heard of it? For pete's sake TAKE F%#@ING RESERVATIONS, at least on the weekends. It's super good food and people are going to go there. It would be so much easier if one didn't have to wait 1.5 hours to get in. It takes the pressure off you guys. If I've been waiting for hours, it had better be some flipping good pizza. Reservations. Take them. We'll all be happier.",

As many have said before me... not surprised by how good this place is based on its creators. If it is possible for food to not only look but TASTE beautiful... this pizza is proof. There are so many exquisite flavor combinations to choose from it's hard to narrow it down to one decision - which is why I suggest you do what I did and bring friends to order everything else you want off the menu and then share all of it.  We had the Sweet Potato pizza (sweet potatoes, ricotta, and sage) and the Margherita (fresh basil and roasted tomatoes). I don't usually like tomatoes as a pizza topping but, HAVE MERCY, this pizza is probably the best pizza I have ever had. Ever. Watch out, Italy.  The house made wine coolers are also ridiculous. Making it a point to go back until I try every single one... at least a few times.",

They roast a few campari tomatoes and serve them up with fresh mozzarella, a healthy portion of aged balsamic, drizzle of olive oil and a few basil leaves.  That cheese is seriously melt-in-your-mouth delicious. And the buttery-ness of the cheese goes jut perfectly with the acidity in the tomatoes and balsamic.  A sprinkle of fresh-cracked pepper and sea salt is the cherry on top.  If you're an olive fan, it should go without saying to try Castelvetrano olives as well.  As for pizzas, I absolutely love the Casanova.  The Answer is really good as is the Manifesto.  I even enjoy the Brussels Sprout pizza.  I'm leaning toward the Sweet Potato pizza next time with sausage added to make it a bit more savory. As with most restaurants, I have yet to make it to the dessert menu... If you are in the mood for adult beverages, their house made wine coolers are light and refreshing.  They have a good craft beer and nice wine list too.  On Monday and Tuesdays after 8pm, you can get a pizza and 2 sm pitchers OR a bottle of wine for only $20.  If you don't want to drink and then drive, you can get this same deal through their carry out window.  Winning!!",

We ordered two large, one pepperoni and one meatball.  The meatball was especially good !!  The size was smaller than expected but no matter.  The flavor made up for it and besides we ended up taking some home anyway. So I guess the size was perfect.  The place itself was very nice.  Trendy, music playing- loud. So if it's quiet ambiance you're after, this is not the place.  We had to lean forward and repeat several times to have conversation with each other.   It is definitely a trendy loud hip place I guess you'd call it.  The people were exceptionally nice.  It felt as if we had been there before by the way they interacted with us, which was welcoming.  The one girl in particular who told  us she was new brought our pizza and asked if we wanted fresh mozzarella on top.  We said yes, she came with the mozzarella and started shaving some on top.  Then about 1/3 of the block broke off and fell on top of one of the pizzas.  We laughed because it was unexpected and she was so adorable about it and kept doing her thing.  Sweet!  She was so cute I liked her a lot and SHE IS THE REASON I'd go back notwithstanding the great pizza itself.  So I hope she got a large portion of the very nice tip we left.  I don't remember her name, but I'll remember next time.  I would go back and would recommend any pizza lover to go here, it's great!  I gave 4 stars just because of the loudness.  They could stand to turn down the volume a little, not a lot, just a little.",

We arrived around 6:30 after being told this was a good time to arrive (no reservations for parties under 8 people).  We had just under this amount and were told it would likely be short wait.  Well, after a 30+ minute drive, we were told we had a 2 hour wait.  After some smooth talking, it was shortened to 60 minutes and we agreed to stay.    Fast forward 90 minutes and we were still waiting for a table.  In general, it was a big deal, its to be expected in a pre-summer weekend.   The next issue was the service.  I found the front staff and servers to be a bit pretentious.  This is a big pet peeve of mine.  No one deserves to be talked down to.  Our waiter was nice in general, but was very inattentive.  Several parts of our order were messed up or not even brought to our tables.  When we asked about this, they acted annoyed.    The food was good - we ordered 2 veggie pizzas and 2 meat pizzas.  As a vegetarian, I only tried the veggie pizzas, but they were legit.  The appetizers & drinks were ok.  Again, things were forgotten so I can't give a whole review.  If you're close by & want pizza, perhaps give it a try.  If its the weekend, you're better of trying somewhere else.  The Phoenix area has so many great pizza places that I don't recommend wasting your time at a place that is more pretentious than it is delicious.",

    "text": "First yelp review ever for me!  I've been to Federal Pizza several times, and have used their drive-up takeout.  Everyone I have brought here has liked it!  Their buildout is a fantastic repurpose of the bank building.  The service has been consistently great, with drinks always refilled.  It can be a little loud if you're in one of the center booths, but nowhere near as bad as the music blasting at Joyride next door.  I remember it being much quieter on Federal's patio, so that's an option!  I have managed to avoid having to use the valet parking.  Thankfully there is now a parking lot available across the street, and they built a crosswalk.  As for the food, I've tried the pepperoni and meatball pizzas, plus a custom pancetta and egg pizza.  All have been very tasty, though the pepperoni is quite oily and the meatball pizza was a tad bland when I ordered it onion-free.  As others have noted, their distinct crust is thin, pillowy, chewy, and very delicious, even if they bake it a bit longer than I would prefer (I guess they're reacting to undercooked complaints by waiting for the crust to lightly scorch).  The meatball sandwich was also good.  The Oreo dessert (Lil' Triple) actually tastes a lot better and less processed than it sounds, and the bombilini are also great when fresh and warm.  Minus 1 star for somewhat high prices, particularly if you customize your toppings.",

I'm picky about my pizza, and if you're going to go avant-garde on the toppings, they had better be well thought out. And these are. Date and prosciutto with ricotta and argula? Perfectly executed salty/sweet/creamy. Brussel sprout with manchego? Well cooked sprouts with pancetta is an winning combo. Chili/corn/broccolini/goat cheese? I'm not a vegetarian, but if I could eat this pizza all the time, I'd be fine with it (watch for the slow burn, the heat will catch up with you). The crust is nice and thin, well cooked and well seasoned, and the sauce is bright and fresh. If you're looking for a top-notch pizza joint with something other than your usual pepperoni, this is your spot.",

The music is amazingly appropriate, but it's the food that must be raved about.  From their Arnold Palmer drink to their pairings of beer with the right pizza, this is what it's all about.  Start to finish, everything that came out of the kitchen and onto our table was nothing short of delicious. The pizza crust was phenomenal  crunchy and just the right size. Everything we ate looked very inviting.  This place-by far- is my favorite pizza place!",

We enjoyed the Mon and Tue special of a pizza and bottle of wine for $20. We also ordered the TLC salad, beets and pears really go well together for a salad, and we ordered the Polenta Sticks with romesco sauce. Romesco is one of my latest obsessions and this was as good as my partner makes his so nice to have something homemade feeling out of town. We had the Manifesto pizza with sausage, goat cheese and fennel. Delicious combo of flavors with a crispy on the outside and chewy crust. This would give Black Sheep pizza a run for competition back in Minneapolis.   The vibe was hip, casual but not pretentious. We had great service. The place was busy on a Monday night so that was a good sign.",

For starters - how can I not adore the concept of picking up amazing food and a bottle of wine or growler or beer from a drive-thru if so desired? Admittedly super lazy, sometimes I want good food, but don't want to give up the comfort of my slippers to get it. Federal is the perfect solution!  The roommate and I shared the corn coin appetizer - not bad at all, but I think it would have been amazing if prepared more elote style. Next time I'll get the beets or sprouts instead. We also decided to split one of the pizzas. With MJ Bread responsible for the dough and Schreiner's doing the sausage, no big surprise that it was a hit! (And doing fresh grated parm from the big block directly onto the pie was a nice touch that makes a big difference to this girl!)  Also ordered was the roasted veggie board - with sprouts instead of potatoes. It was big and beautiful and super tasty! I suggest this for any celiac, vegetarian, vegan or anyone who likes amazing veggies and every combination thereof! HUGE winner in this dish!  As DD, I was sticking with iced tea - but look forward to exploring some of the beers and checking out a couple of their wine coolers.  And getting that veggie board again!",

The sandwich was good, just your normal caprese though,  nothing special.  I tried a slice of pizza and I immediately fell in love!!  This thing literally melted in my mouth.

    "text": "Last night I was in a positively lovely mood. I'd just come from a blissful vacation, eating some of the best bar-b-que this country has to offer in Kansas City. I'm not a picky eater by any stretch of the imagination, but my tastebuds are educated and I always appreciate care and quality in a meal and yesterday Federal Pizza offered that in spades.   My lovely date and I couldn't decide where to go for dinner. She'd been craving pasta for a week and wanted something simple but delicious that would satisfy the urge she'd built up in her mind. I like subtlety, elegance, and finesse. She's not the most adventurous eater but she loves trying new things and she trusts me, so when I decided we would start with the Mussels I knew there was a bit of risk involved. HOME-FRICKIN'-RUN! I don't know if it's a common order on a menu packed with delicious options and pizzas but since we weren't getting pizza this time, I thought mussels would be a great opener and boy was I right. There's a luscious sauce that perfectly accents but doesn't overpower the mussels, and they were fresh and tender and cooked with chorizo which gave the dish a lovely flavor and spice. I like to think chefs intentionally gift you a couple mussels out of the shell that hide under the rest, soaking in the sauce and waiting for you to think you're done. It may look like a technical oversight but once you put the sauce-soaked meat in your mouth, you realize the blessing that's been bestowed upon you. To accent this dish they provide a nicely grilled lemon halve which adds the perfect touch of acid, and two grilled slices of bread which we used, of course, for sopping. YUM!  For our entrees we went with the Spaghetti and Meatballs (her choice) and their \"Trust Us\" special of the evening - Linguini Carbonara. I have a rule about taking chef's suggestions; Always do it. Who cares what you like?! They know their ability and more important, they know the product. Oftentimes a chef will choose to highlight ingredients they've scored in their specials, or to show off their skills in some other regard. I saw the \"Trust Us\" sign on the board while walking in and I knew I was getting it from the jump. My lovely date had me pick a backup dish in case they'd run out of it. But surprise surprise, people in Phoenix don't like taking risks so I was the first one who ordered it! The pasta was perfectly cooked, balanced with a dreamy creamy sauce and evenly distributed pancetta and freshly grated parmesan cheese. It came topped with an egg, poached and then lightly breaded and fried. SO GOOD! Ugh, each bite was simply heaven. Carbonara is one of the simplest pastas to make, but it's complexity is in achieving the perfect balance of flavors and texture. In this regard the chef nailed it.   My lovely date thoroughly enjoyed her Spaghetti and Meatballs too. I tried some and the meatballs were just the right size, like Goldilocks kinda \"just right.\" The pomodoro, again a simple sauce, was executed judiciously. Fresh basil, perfect amount of cracked pepper. Primo.   Actually it was with this dish that their five stars were earned, as the portion size was large so my lovely date ended up asking for a box to take the rest home. We paid the check and left, but it took until we arrived at my place (I live a short distance away, not even three minutes driving) that we realized we'd left her box on the table. It was too good to chalk as a loss, so we turned around and headed back. Now, it would have been completely within their right to just toss the box after bussing the table. They would have lost nothing and we would have been sad but we also would have gotten over it. It's not like someone would have died. But they didn't. When I came back it was placed aside on the back register, where the nice hostess handed it to me.  I think I take for granted that I live in walking distance of such nice restaurants like Federal Pizza but I'm going to have to make it a point to drop by more often, as much for the food as for the care and thoughtfulness of the kitchen and front-of-house staff. Thank you!",

The first time was a weekend and we didn't have a reservation, waited maybe 10 min and we were seated. The other two times I made a reservation. \"A reservation for pizza?!?\" you say?? Yes, it's worth it.   Their menu is creative, with pizza standards like pepperoni and sausage very nicely done with quality meats. Lots of other gourmet toppings available, and their wood fired thin crust is just the right mix of crispy and chewy. Don't miss the Brussels sprouts starter cooked perfectly with pancetta.   Federal Pizza has a pretty good beer selection on tap, a great wine list. The restaurant is clean and it's clear the operator pays attention to details, from the tasteful but not-too-bright lighting to custom-logo bathroom tissue in the restroom, and always prompt and great service from the staff.",

The Manifesto was not to be outdone, though. Schreiner's sausage, mushrooms, goat cheese...a big ole slice of good.  My husband, the pizza purist, gave high marks to the pepperoni, too!

    "text": "We were greeted friendly enough. Seated at a raised booth right by the Server Station. I thought it was strange that asking us IF we wanted water or not was such a production? I mean, you would think Federal's tap water was from the Fountain of Youth the way it was presented to us with such FLOURISH as if this was a gift from the Gods?! Place was nearly empty save for a couple of tables occupied, a completely empty bar, and some tables outside claimed by families with kids. No reason for more employees than customers in the place to be running around acting like chickens with their heads cut off scrambling erratically about the place like ants on an ant hill? I even asked our server Nancy, what's with all the commotion and the shouting back and forth to each other? I wondered if there was an entire other side of the restaurant I was missing? No. Just keeping up appearances. If they look like they're hustling, then it must be a hip, trendy, fashionable place to dine, right? Wrong. Service was lackluster. Slow. Long intermissions between visiting our table periodically if for no other reason, than to check on things? Prices are outrageous for what you get. Food is meh. Just okay. Nothing to write home to Mom about. I asked for a taste test of two beers which took forever to deliver. Placed our food order, which also took forever on a very slow day, mid-afternoon? Ordered Double-Down half-pizza and wedge salad thinking this was the least expensive thing on the menu at $10.50 for 6 inches. Of pizza. I kid you not. It was 4 pitiful cracker-size triangles of a whole lot of crust, a scant amount of tomato sauce that tasted like Chef Boyardee from a can, and the thinnest possible trace of cheese and exactly ONE (1) pepperoni per triangle. Want fresh Parmesan? OH! This requires a big production too!! Think how special you're going to feel when they shred it over your 6 inches. Of Pizza. For you? How very chic. Tell ya what. I can shake my own parmesan out of a jar. I don't require this. It's just for SHOW! Anticipating a WEDGE salad, (it's in the description folks?! Should be a no-brainer?!) Instead I got what added up to no more than a stalk/rib/root of a head of salad with a whisper of dressing, exactly ONE (1) not TWO, tee-tiny little cherry tomato for a garnish, nary a scant trace of Gorgonzola cubes (I tasted two) and i think there may have been a bacon bit in there somewhere. The lettuce leaf wasn't even enough to serve as a fig leaf. For extra fun, it wasn't served separately or before your pizza, like a first-course? It was placed on a tin pie plate alongside a hot pizza on a thin layer of wax paper. So I had warm salad. I took advantage of...(Or did they take advantage of me for ordering it?), a half-glass of Holly something or other Chardonnay. Of course, this had to be delivered by the bartender who had to demonstrate his talents by pouring my wine for me from a cute little wine decanter to let it breathe first, and then into my glass with such flourish and dramatic interpretation. I have gotten more wine out of a Dixie Cup. To add insult to injury, Nancy never returned to our table until she delivered our food. And then never returned again until it was time to collect the check. I had accidentally dropped a knife on the floor, hoping that Nancy would return so I could ask her for another one, to cut my 1 or 2 leafs of bib lettuce from their root stalks which made up most of the so-called \"Wedge\" salad?! But she never did. So, I went without and used a fork. For extra fun, one employee shouted \"HEY\" to another employee <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fright.over.my&s=86625df18a0f463feb6b2cdfe458807146196b0858856e480df8625baa4e6e14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">right.over.my</a>.shoulder and into my left ear, and the other employee shouted back at him his response at the same or higher volume into my right ear while I was trying to enjoy my morsel of food. I noticed this goes on a lot here. Employees shouting back and forth to each other. I am sure this is by design. It's an ill-attempt of the owner to train his staff into pretending like they are in an authentic Italian Restaurant, where there's a lot of arm-waving, and shouting at the top of one's lungs, to make it seem like the customer is all part of the action!! What a joke! So transparent what they are trying to do here. It's all one big Grand Illusion. ALL THIS FOR $35 for 2 people for lunch. Not including a tip just because I am that generous of a person and don't like to be perceived as a cheapskate. I will never, ever return again. And recommend to anyone who does not consider themselves one of the thousands of Suckers born every minute, to RUN, don't walk away from visiting Federal Pizza. Complete RIP-OFF!!",

The decor / ambience inside the restaurant is top notch. Very hip, very trendy, but also comfortable.  We ordered drinks. Watermelon Wine Cooler and a Pilsner Urquell. The wine coolers are fantastic. Very original and done very well. Next we moved to appetizers. The F&A Veg Board. Wonderful! A nice nice mix of vegetables paired with romesco sauce.   The pizza came next. We opted for a Gemini and a Meatball. I gotta say, I have had better pizza (Bianco, Cibo, Parlor). The ingredients were good and inventive. However, the crust was just ok. We paired the pizza with crispy polenta sticks. They were a home run. Would definitely get them again.  I would recommend this place of drinks and snacks. If it is pizza you are searching for, there are better options. However, all around, the place is done well and definitely worth a look.",

I had always come for the pizza but recently ventured out and tried their salads and sandwiches. Crazy, I know. Everything I have tried was delicious. Never a complaint, and never wished I had ordered something else instead. They make their own wine coolers which are fun and tasty (and quite a bit stronger than the B&J crap you get at the grocery store. Its just a fun, hip restaurant with friendly staff and laid back atmosphere and I look forward to every visit here. In fact I have reservations for 10 for my birthday tonight!",

    "text": "I can't tell if it was high expectations from all the hype that caused my disappointment or the food in general.   After hear a lot about how good this place was I decided it would make a good spot for date night. Came in at 6 on a Sunday and were sat immediately.   Having previously stalked the menu I asked about the Mister Mister appetizer. Was given a vague description describing it basically as a veggie plate with some dipping sauce. What came was actually pretty good but it was cheese sprinkled crispy veggies (I think lightly fried) with 2 dipping sauces it was pretty good.  As for the pizza we got the Casanova and Manifesto. The casanova was fine but I felt like the dates had over powered the prosciutto (which seemed to be lacking some flavor) and the combo wasn't anything special as I feel like every place has a bruschetta just like this. The manifesto was also okay but I felt like the sausage was very bland and plain and the goat cheese didn't mesh well with the other flavors. The mushrooms were the star of that pizza by far.  On both pizza's i felt like the crust was good but soggy in center. I think overall it was somewhere between thing crust and regular which is a no mans land for pizza crusts. The flavor was good but not amazing.  Dessert may have been the most disappointing thing. We got the Lil' tripple which if you have ever had jello chocolate pudding with an oreo and some cool whip you have already experiences. I was expecting some more unique flavor from this but really oreo pudding snack packs have the same taste.  Maybe my expectations were too high for this place but I walked away feeling like for the money there are other places I would rather go and it isn't even in the league with Bianco. For me it also isn't somewhere I would being making the trip to go to again except for maybe a happy hour if other people where there. There is nothing wrong with the pizza but I think the place is overhyped.",

    "text": "It seems this is the place hipsters go to get their pizza, kind of like how Gallo Blanco is the Hipster Macayo's.  They're so hip that they don't even put the name of the restaurant on the building!  That pretty much guarantees an overinflated Yelp rating, because a lot of hipsters have trouble thinking for themselves.  But I digress.  If you read my last few weeks' worth of reviews, you'd know that I have been eating a lot of pizza lately.  We are on a sort-of pizza quest.  I had high hopes for this one, and the menu actually looked really awesome.  I went with the Casanova, which is a white pizza with ricotta, dates, arugula, prosciutto, and pecorino.  I also had a ginger ale to drink.  The ginger ale was probably in the Canada Dry tier.  That means so flavorless that they're willing to serve it for free on an airplane.  The difference between a fountain and microbrewed soft drink is probably more profound for ginger ales than any other soft drink variety.  As far as the pie goes, the toppings were excellent.  Go here if you like the focus of your pizza to be entirely on the toppings, because the crust sucks.  It was a little too tough, and the flavor was worse than any other artisan pizza I've had.  This was not knife-and-fork pizza; it was pick-it-up-and-eat-it pizza.  That's how you know the crust is subpar.  Besides that, the ambiance is a little too modern.  When I sit down for a nice handmade pie, I like it to be warm and cozy.  This place is trendy, with loud music blasting in the restaurant.  They need to dial it down a notch.  Of all the wood-fired pizzas I have had in Phoenix, Federal was one of my least favorite.  Maybe better than Cibo, but not as good as Pomo, Bianco, or Il Bosco.  Or even Timo's flatbread pizza.  The chef might be creative, but without a good crust or a good restaurant, eclectic toppings become a bit of a gimmick.",

To make matters worse, it's rather common for people to not like anchovies, so you'd think they would make it a priority to inform people of that sort of thing in advance.  Nope.  Place was incredibly dark, so much so that I felt like some grandpa who wishes he had a little flashlight to read the menu.  Pizza had a good crust except for the burnt 'n charred portions, and the toppings were a bit scarce.  Beer list was good with many craft beers from nearby states and a few imports.  Thankfully, not another place with a bunch of lame Arizona beers.  Service was confusing because it was as if we had 2 or 3 different people involved in the process, and even at that we still had trouble getting a box and cheque so we could leave.  Prices were reasonable and parking is tight.    Really wish there wasn't the anchovies issue.",

We chose to sit at the bar to skip the wait.  The bartender with the English accent had a great personality ... funny, informative.   We came on a Monday and chose to partake in their awesome $20 pizza and booze special. The wine and beer selection was great and had the same thought and care to it that Postinos has. We had ourselves a refreshing white blend, perfect for a hot and humid night.   We split some polenta sticks to start. They were good but underwhelming. The taste reminded me a bit of the fried macaroni and cheese from TGI Fridays. Can't figure out if that is a good thing... Next time I think we will split a salad to go with our pizza. They look scrumptious.  We chose the pizza with the brussel sprouts and manchego, but without the prosciutto. Yummmmm! Hard to believe I hated brussels as a kid. This pizza can make anyone eat their veggies! The crust was perfect. My husband loved it too and he usually doesn't care for pizza that doesn't have tomato sauce.   Although I loved the wine we were drinking I was insanely curious about their wine coolers. So my husband finished off the wine and I ordered the grapefruit ginger cooler. It went down way too easy. I can see how these can be addictive. And they pack quite the boozy punch.  While sitting at the bar I noticed they have a drive through. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! I almost fell out of my seat. So you are saying I can get one of their delicious pizzas AND their booze to go without even leaving my car? I can enjoy it in my pajamas with my booty planted on my couch while watching my nerdy BBC shows??   We asked if their patio was dog-friendly. Why yes it is. I can picture our dog at our feet on their cute little patio that overlooks Central after the weather isn't hellaciously hot anymore.   So yes, of course we would return. Duh. I would take Federal Pizza over a 3 hour wait and a side of pretentiousness at Pizzeria Bianco any day.",

My girlfriend and I had a bad experience here over the summer (aka food poisoning).  You can view the whole story under the review from Mackenzie F.  To this date, nothing ever came about from the owners.  At no point were we ever trying to \"get\" anything from them or anyone else.  We simply wanted to ensure it wouldn't happen to others.  We just wanted a chance to voice our concerns and be assured that steps would be taken internally to correct any issues.  I have been in the service industry for many years at various levels and I cannot believe that an owner would simply not care if one of their patrons ended up at the hospital.  I am a realist and I understand that the specific food issue could have come from anywhere in the supply chain right up to the preparation stage.  But to completely ignore an issue like this is unacceptable.  We will not be frequenting any of the Upward Projects businesses going forward.",

Anyhow, they have great drink selections (besides beer) including wine and house made wine coolers.  Some of the wine cooler flavors I have tried include: grapefruit ginger, raspberry lavender, and blackberry rosemary.  All of which were good, but I liked the blackberry rosemary the best.  I usually order the castlevtrano olives as a little snack and a Great Little Salad.  I have only tried the Brussles Sprout pizza (cause I'm trying not to eat wheat, get off my back!) which comes with manchego cheese, lemon, roasted garlic and pancetta (I got mine without meat). It is perfection! The texture of the crust is perfect, with a nice little crunch around the edge (thanks MJ).  I recently tried the Garganelli pasta dish, which took much difficulty to not wolf it down.  It was so good (even though I think I overdosed on gluten), it came with: broccolini, pine nuts, oven roasted tomatoes, red pepper, pecorino all tossed in a lemon basil pesto.  One word: nomtastic.    The decor is rad and the people serving it up are, too.  If you haven't checked out Federal, get your buns down there ASAP!  Cheers!",

Upward projects generally has cool concept restaurants with good food so we decided to try it out.  The restaurant is located across from Windsor, another upward project restaurant, and like all of them, it has a cool, hip vibe with a cute little patio.   As for the food, we tried the \"big star\" pizza & the \"tlc\" salad. I gotta say...food was great! The big star pizza is a wood fired pizza with a yummy combo of toppings...sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms & olives...I can see why they call it the \" big star\". And the salad was a nice refreshing blend of arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, almonds, fennel and cheese all tossed in a light citrus shallot vinaigrette...yum!   So if you've been to the other upward project restaurants & like them, this will be another one you will like too :)",

    "text": "Four stars for the pizza. Three stars for everything else.   Walking in, I couldnt help feeling that this place was a chain (like a national chain). I dont have much to say about this other than I never felt completely comfortable. Our waitress was decent at being cordial, but she didnt seem very attentive during our meal. I had to flag her down twice for water and the check. I like that they have craft beer on tap, but their selection was not my favorite. I ordered the half pizza half salad, since they dont do by the slice. The pizza was actually pretty damn good. I like the combination of toppings they offer, as well as the additional items you can add. Granted the good stuff to add makes the pizza way more expensive but thats just the way it goes. The bread was soft yet firm, and the veggies were fresh. The salad unfortunately was drenched in dressing and lacked much flavor. If i were you, I would skip the salad all together.   Come here for pizza. Other than that, I would be careful of what to expect. It might be enjoyable or it might be just OK. I wouldnt mind trying thir other pizzas though.",

They also have a grilled veggie board served with a slightly tangy dipping sauce that accompanies the vegetables perfectly. While some frown on dipping pizza in ranch dressing, I highly suggest ordering a side or two of their garlic ranch...it's scrumptious! My husband and I always order the same pizza which is the Big Star, no olives. This pizza comes with a plethora of veggies, schreiners sausage, and red sauce. Our friends ordered the meatball pizza and raved about it as well.   The atmosphere is hip and cool with a large bar and booths that run down the middle of the restaurant. An open kitchen is on the North side of the restaurant allowing guests to watch their pizzas being made. They also have a quaint outside area if you prefer to enjoy this beautiful Phoenix weather.   If you are too busy to dine in, call in your growler and pizza order and visit the drive-through. While I prefer dining in, this is a great option!",

My fav was the Hawaiian. It had pina and meat and was sweet and salty as it should be. We also had the polenta to share and I thought it was really good. It came with a sauce that was so yummy! I wanted a side of that to dip my pizza into. So if you go ask for that sauce!! The polenta was yummy and fried.   I would go again for that sauce that came with the polenta.",

Everything from their pizza,  pasta, appetizers and drinks are utterly delicious. I first tried Federal Pizza when I moved to central Phoenix a couple of years ago. I wanted to try this place out so I ordered a few boxes for my sister's surprise party. EVERYONE at the party could not stop raving about their food.  I always order Casinova. This is a sweet pizza and is my absolute favorite. The prosciutto, arugula and ricotta taste so perfect together. You must order Casanova, you will not regret it!  You can never go wrong with the Big Star (For ya'll meat lovers), and one of their newer ones Pineapple Express.   My boyfriend loves the chicken parm. The house breaded chicken is perfectly cooked and pairs well with the salad. I've had the Mickey White before and I enjoyed it. I usually don't like heavy pastas, but it was pretty good. I always order crisp fingerlings on the side and have tried to replicate it at home but have not been successful!  They allow you to order two different types of pizza in one, and also have some great deals on Mondays and Tuesdays. It gets pretty packed on those days since it is $20 for one pizza and a bottle of wine! You can't beat that!",

Great offer and great outcome.  Sweet chili wings are awesome!   Who knew?  Then we wanted pizza but each wanted a different one.  Again the waiter said we could split one and do different flavors.

They were super sorry and comped the salads but I think you can do better with your estimate.  When we did eat the food was delicious...the pizza was very flavorful.  The only strange flavor was the caesar salad tasted like it was made with kale!  Not a bad thing just a bit shocking when you order a caesar.  I would go back but not on a weekend unless I had a lot to talk about while I waited!",

We gave my parents a gift card to Federal for Christmas and we all went out together last night. I was really impressed with last night's service. It was very busy so the wait was about 20 minutes to half an hour. They had a waiter taking drink orders while we waited and even served us and the rest of the people waiting slices of meatball pizza. I think the staff is very attuned to customers and customer service. Awesome!! :) Oh and by the way the food is awesome!!! I like everything I've tried!!",

We've dined in a few times, but the wait is usually very long (duh...because word is out that it is fantastic) so now we take out 90% of the time.  Our favorite collectively, is the Big Star pizza, my husbands favorite is the Pepperoni and mine is the At Last.  The flavor combination on At Last as a meatless pizza (and I'm a meat eater!) is so well thought out.  I feel like I'm a judge sampling a pizza on a cooking show or something.  Seriously.....try it.  And tonight, we got (our first here) dessert, the Lil Triple.  It was really good. The chocolate cream is more like just chocolate pudding.  But it was cute anyway. And the staff who takes and hands off our take out order are just the nicest and most attentive. We had Josh take care of our take out order tonight, and he was great. Just go...it's worth a bit of a wait.  Bring friends, have some drinks at the bar, the beer selection is great too! Brava!",

    "text": "Was looking forward to checking out Federal Pizza. Atmosphere was great, service was okay, food was not what I expected. We ordered four pizzas for a large party of eight people, three quarters of the pizzas ordered were very undercooked in the middle, which made them doughy and soggy. I then asked the server about how our pizzas were, she said this is because they are woodfired. She then told me I would have to order my pizzas well Done, most woodfired pizza kitchens make sure the pizzas are cooked all the way, regardless of the woodfired method. On the service side, after we ate appetizers and the pizza was delivered, I had to ask for fresh plates and silverware so we could eat our pizza. The server should be looking for things like that, attention to detail. After all that is why we go out to eat for the experience of great food and service. When I go out and treat several people to a meal, I expect to have great service, when I am spending a couple hundred dollars are just a few dollars in your restaurant. At this point I am debating whether or not to give Federal Pizza a second chance.",

We have tried to go here a handful of times but always bailed at the last minute thinking how many variations of California Pizza Kitchen do we really need in this city?  Wow was I wrong about this one, crazy good food here-the pizza exceeded expectations but what made it was the appetizers.  We had the F&A Veg Board which sounds pretty simple- a vegetable plate for all intents and purposes but it is really a mixture of preparations of a medley of both common and uncommon vegetables that really set the tone for the meal. The only thing that lost the 5th star was the service. We started out getting 2 servers, one getting our drink order with appetizer, and then a second one getting the pizza order which we thought was intentional. The pizza showed up before the appetizer so I'm pretty sure it was unintentional.  After the barrage of service, it kind of trailed off from there.  Regardless of that, the food is going to bring us back...great atmosphere.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but when you serve HAIR with the pizza, it's hard to like. My fiance and I decided to finally try Federal Pizza a few months ago. We arrived on a Sunday night and it was very busy. We were promptly seated and started with the Mister Mister, which was over breaded and over cooked artichokes, baby zucchini, and sweet potatoes. The batter was so heavy and very underwhelming in flavor. The presentation was done well, but the execution was poor. We then shared the Chicken Panzanella salad. The salad was fresh, the only thing we didn't enjoy about the salad were the stale croutons. Now, here is where things go completely downhill. We order the Manifesto pizza and the 4 Kings Cheese pizza. I watched the manager on duty, checking the pizzas before they were brought to our table. At one point I witnessed her actually touch our pizza with her bare hands. Being a cook in Maricopa county, it is against health code violation to touch ready to eat food with bare hands. Well, our pizzas, which were raw in the middle, and passed the manager's quality control, were delivered to our table. We immediately pointed this out to our server and they took the pizzas to be cooked more. The cheese pizza arrived both times with a very large and unattractive grease puddle. I know pizza is greasy, but if you are using the high quality ingredients, you state you use, why is there literally a grease puddle. The Manifesto, arrived after being cooked more, my fiance was trying to enjoy his slice, about that time the manager came to our table. As I am taking a bite, and she is asking us if everything is better now, there is a HAIR on my slice of Manifesto. I look at her and say, It would be better if I didn't have a hair on my slice of pizza. Her response was to LAUGH and tell me I'm jinxed. Really? At this point, we were both so turned off. We just wanted to leave and never return. My fiance argued he didn't want anything free, that he wanted to pay and never would we come back again. She insisted on taking care of everything and gave us two coupons for pizza. We wouldn't go back even if it was free. Needless to say, I gave the coupons to a co-worker.",

I met a friend for lunch, (during  office hours) so I couldn't try any of their drinks, but their pizza selection was so intriguing that I didn't even care.  I went simple and boring...  a margherita pizza with green olives, but I thought I would see if they could get the basics right before moving on.. . They nailed it! Probably the best I've had in a really long time.  My lunch date had a \"Abbey\" Style beer which she enjoyed (Yes, right in front of me ! It's okay Mandi B. I still love you=D) and the Brussels sprout pizza with arugula and prosciutto.  She said it was delicious.  After I ordered, I smelled and saw all of these wonderful concoctions of pizza, roasted corn and salads... none of which I ordered.  I don't regret my order, but can't wait to go back and try something new.  Maybe Sweet potato and arugula pizza? Stay tuned...",

The wine coolers are interesting though, at $8, are a bit overpriced.  Cute mini booths seating inside and a decent outdoor seating area.

    "text": "I live around the corner from LGO/Postino Arcadia and am a regular and fan of both. Windsor is great as well. Federal is a disappointment and tragedy. I'm not sure whether all these positive reviews are paid for by Federal or sponsored, or just by clueless foodies because they are outright lies. For a restaurant group that makes amazing pizza's at LGO, I'm shocked as too how disappointing and what a big letdown the pizzas are here. They are all overly oily and soggy in the middle. I've tried four different pies on two separate occasions and everyone in my party felt the same way and it didn't sound like anyone was going to go back for a while until the soggy dough and oily topping issues were fixed. When I was there on 11/08/2012 a co-worker had a stellar meatball sandwich, soft airy fresh baked pizza dough as the bread, fresh melted mozzarella, great meatballs and sauce, simple, traditional and delicious. Went back on 11/11/2012 to have the meatball sandwich that looked so good a few days earlier, talk about being letdown. For some reason the sandwich had been reinvented, it now had barely any meatballs on it and they had been supplemented with a ridiculous amount of caramelized like onions and the bread which was amazing on the previous occasion was hard as a rock. What in the world, massive amounts of onions on a meatball hero with barely any meatballs to be found, confusing. The pizza was no better, still soggy in the middle and disappointing. All restaurants have kinks to work out when they first open, but for a successful restaurant group that's hit homeruns with pizza before, there should be no kinks to work out with the pizza, nor should the simplest thing in the world, a meatball hero go from amazing to gross in three days. Another issue we experienced both times there is the service. Plenty of staff onsite, the problem is finding someone to help you or them coming back to check on you. Both times we sat around with empty drinks for a half-hour and had to hunt down someone to get a refill or the check. Plus this staff is very different than the staff at their other establishments, seems like a bunch of self-entitled hipsters that are too important are running the show. I'll stick to LGO for pizza from this crew; hopefully they don't experiment with that perfect formula.",

The margherita pizza looked like it wasn't freshly cooked and they just threw couple pieces of basil and tomatoes on it. When I took a bite out of it, I wasn't very pleased with it. It basically tasted what it looked like, which was mostly dough lol. The other pizza tasted plain too, but once I bit the date, it tasted better. The dates had a sweet taste to it which balanced out nicely with the prosciutto. Overall, the food wasn't so great this time, but the Service was.",

I was having a bad day and did not feel like cooking at all or interacting with any more people, and remembered this place has a drive-thru. It took me awhile to figure out what to try, but the girl taking my order on the phone was super patience and helpful. My order was ready when I arrived 15 minutes later and the smells that filled my car were purely intoxicating. When I got home and finally was able to try the handmade ravioli I was starving, but the flavor was so amazing and unique that I had to eat slowly and savor it. Truly one of the absolute best pasta dishes I have had in my life. Italian food in PHX tends to be below subpar, but this, this is a stand alone. I was so blown away I saved a few for my husband for when he got home later. It was still incredible warmed back up. I also had the Great Little Salad, which lived up to its name nicely.

    "text": "Federal Pizza Makes a Statement.  Once upon a time, back in the madcap '80s, some people had lots of money to blow on things like cocaine, South African gold krugerrands, and Cabbage Patch Dolls, or deposit their money in Savings & Loan bank-like institutions. Thanks to people like dead, local crook Charles Keating, who built the Phoenician Resort, the scandal of Savings & Loans cost everybody. Lots.  Flash forward: all the S&Ls went belly up. One ghost of the era was the derelict Federal Savings & Loan on the corner of Oregon and Central Avenues. Flash more forwarder: Upward Projects, who owns and operates area juggernaut Postino (whose bruschetta is GREAT, but not the BEST--that award goes to Cibo. End of subject.), the fab Windsor (with an amazing Crab Cake Sandwich) and Churn bought the white elephant. They've also purchased the defunct Aiello's Italian eatery next door. (Poor, old veteran, nearby Dairy Queen, better be afraid. Very afraid.) Economists call this a \"monopoly.\"  Hence, Federal Pizza was born, as a nod to their ancient incarnation. The old S&L was gutted and fashionably remodeled with reclaimed materials, including a ceiling brilliantly utilizing stacks of corrugated cardboard to muffle the \"thumpa-thumpa\" music. The interior is light and airy in the daytime filled with business people and hipsters and intimate in the night, filled with hipsters and glitterati. The booths filling the center give you a spectacular stage for viewing the clientele and the open kitchen. One BIG boon is the charming Tom Risner, who couldn't be a better tuck trader serving investors.  The TLC Salad ($10) is a safe deposit standout with arugula, spring greens, beets, pears, smoked almonds, fennel, Pecorino and is a sparkling choice among the five salads. You can add chicken for $4.  Twelve very different interest drawing pizzas star on the menu. Each imaginatively conceived pie is 12\" crafted by Master Baker (that's \"baker\") MJ Coe, husband of pastry artist Tammie. One features roasted Brussels sprouts,pancetta, Manchego cheese, roasted garlic and lemon zest. A variety of tastes make it a surprise, but if you don't like the cruciferous sprouts, you might stick with the more traditional Pepperoni or Four Kings Cheese Pizza. Most of these brick oven babies run around $13.  Four prime rate sandwiches are available, served on the fantastic house- made bread. However the Porchetta with slow-roasted pork loin, pork belly, arugula, carmelized onion and lemon ($10) was a bad debt: fatty, fatty, fatty!  May love be your next big wave. A side of crispy Polenta Sticks with Romesco Sauce ($4) earned a high appraisal.   The former Drive-Thru is re- purposed for \"take away;\" the fancy new-speak for \"take out.\"  You won't have to dip into your Christmas Club Account to afford Federal Pizza, but you might want to save a few pennies here and there. Your account can add up fast if you're a spendthrift. And you know where that got the Savings & Loan situation.",

Sadly,  Federal needs to update their menu to accommodate the gluten challenged people. No GF pizza crust which seems unusual because their thing is pizza. There is a GF pasta option, but they charge an additional $3.00 for the pasta. I feel ripped off and disappointed. I enjoyed Federal for 3 years, but I will no longer be dining here until/unless they offer a GF crust and come down on the increase on the GF pasta.",

I'm a strong drink kinda gal - gimme an Old Fashioned any day.  BUT, these coolers redefine what you think you know of as a wine cooler.  Its not that they're super strong or anything, but they are beyond refreshing on a hot day.  (Or a cool day for that  matter.)  I highly recommend the Grapefruit Ginger as long as you aren't a super sweet-tooth.  Atmosphere is great, people are friendly, food and drink are yummy.  Go now!",

    "text": "Got a Federal Pizza gift card for Christmas so needless to say I was eager to give this place a try.  This a pizzeria set in what used to be an old Federal bank just north of Central and Camelback.  Its one in a growing megaplex of hugely popular concept restaurants owned and operated by the group Upward Projects (purveyors of restaurants such as Windsor, Churn, Postino and Joyride Taco House).  Living in Downtown Phoenix, I'm something of a pizza connoisseur as there's great pizza everywhere.  So how does Federal stack up?  I got their margherita pizza as that's usually a good measure of comparison.  It's simple, clean, and (when done right) hits the spot.  The tomato and olive oil are notes you definitely pick up with Federal's version, though the cheese and basil are far less pronounced than other places I've tried.  Tasty, but I've had better.  For dessert, I got an order of their Bombolini.  Essentially giant donut holes you dip in chocolate sauce.  Holy moly is there a lot of sugar on those!  I probably could've wind sprinted the 3 miles back to my apartment I had such a sugar high after eating those.  Huge portion too.  I also got a four kings cheese blend pizza to go for dinner.  Once again it was a tasty pizza, but I've had similar cheese combo pizzas at other joints that can stack up pretty well.  The restaurant itself can be described as hipster or trendy chic, but its very family friendly.  The wait staff was extremely friendly and along with some fun overhead music ranging from classic rock to modern pop, the place has a very fun vibe about it.  Definitely has a modern urban neighborhood feel.  From the orange booths, to the seemingly endless bar, to the kitchen that looks right out into the restaurant, to the relaxed patio looking out towards Central Ave, this place has quintessential Upward Projects creativity written all over it.  So to summarize, five stars for the staff and the atmosphere.  But I only give three stars for the food.  From my own experience, you can find better quality pizza and sides at places like Pomo, Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, or even La Piazza Locale.  That said, I love what Upward Projects has done with this building and the Central/Camelback corridor as a whole.  It's great to see historic structures preserved and repurposed for something new and innovative.  Can't wait to see what they come up with next!",

They are extremely accommodating- I've called in lunch orders at opening and they have them ready for me at the drive through in 20 minutes, they seat large groups, and their servers are genuinely friendly and attentive. I love sitting out on the patio and enjoying their music playlist. They need to publish their pandora station because it never fails.   I have yet to eat a pizza here I don't like. The Casanova is my personal favorite with prosciutto, dates, ricotta cheese and sauce. The perfect savory sweet combination. The manifesto, the answer, the sweet potato and even the Brussel sprout pizzas won't let you down! On their menu they also let you know what drink pairs well with it.   I would suggest sticking to their pizza. When I saw the warm donuts and chocolate sauce on the dessert menu, I was practically drooling on my pizza, but I was not overwhelmed by the dessert when I tried it. The donuts were a little airy and not very flavorful.",

Super super flavorful...  The dough for the crust was delish! I would say this place ranked above Pizzeria Bianco for me...and I love Biancos.  We finished off the meal with dessert: Bombolini.

Subpar service aside, once the food began to arrive at Federal we were met with a somewhat mixed bag as the appetizers, including the oft raved 'corn coins' and a bright, bold, and balanced salad of various beets proved far superior to the pies - particularly the doughy, limp, and undercooked Margherita.  Faring better, both in terms of ingredients and texture, I will admit that the Casanova was a good pizza with great chew and top quality ingredients, but for two pizzas on the exact same day to be so wildly inconsistent certainly gives me pause when considering a recommendation of Federal Pizza, let alone a return visit...not in a city where far better pizza can be found in abundance.  A nice space for drinks, appetizers, and even desserts perhaps I'll give Federal Pizza a second chance at some point, but with Pizzeria Bianco, 'Pomo, The Parlor, and La Grande Orange all turning out a superior product there is no chance I'd wait in line to do so.",

Since I finally had the opportunity to try the famous pizza place in Phoenix (which I didn't care for at all), I've wanted to explore other local pizzerias to determine who really had the best pizza in the Valley. I had found Federal through a Yelp search and I've been wanting to try it for a while.  I finally went last week. We were seated on their outdoor patio right away. We went on a Sunday around 3 and they were having a happy hour. However, neither of us got drinks. I think we had about 3 different people ask us if we wanted drinks, I guess they were just being thorough. I've also been on an artichoke kick lately so we got the Big Artichoke. It was definitely big and very good. The truffle oil wasn't too pungent or strong. The seasoning was great and it wasn't too buttery or oily as some places prepare it. Just as we were about to finish, our pizza came.  We got the Margherita pizza with fresh parmesan on top. The fresh parmesan was so good and not like anything else I've had before. The pizza was also delicious. The cheese was great and had that slightly crispy burnt cheese taste where the cheese met the crust. The crust was also crispy and really good.   My boyfriend and I both agreed that this was the best pizza we've had so far in AZ. However, we do have another place I want to check out before I can officially crown Federal as my favorite. Until then, Federal is definitely somewhere we'll have to go back to. We also walked to Churn which is right across the street for some dessert which was a perfect way to end a perfect meal.",

We tried the following: homemade wine cooler (blueberry & hibiscus), fried green tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, and pizza with onions and mushrooms. All were absolutely delicious. While it doesn't beat Spinatos (best pizza in AZ) it's definitely excellent quality pizza. We weren't feeling adventurous this time around, but next time I'm totally going to give the sweet potato pizza a shot!",

    "text": "If you're a fan of Windsor or Postino and love pizza, just go to Federal Pizza already. The spot is owned by Craig DeMarco's Upward Projects, too, and it has the same hip vibe all the other restaurants do -- with good food, as always, too.  The interior actually reminds me a little of Chelsea's Kitchen, with warm lighting and a homey feel. There's a bare bones patio facing the street, and the servers tend to be young and have their own style because of the lack of uniforms. The joint is casual -- I even went right after teaching a workout class, and no one seemed to care about my grungy attire.  The drink menu is simple, with beers and flavored wine coolers. I got a lavendar raspberry one, which was delivered in an oh-so-cute little jar-like glass. The cooler was refreshing and tasted like flavored Sprite -- I'd recommend trying one.  I started my meal with an appetizer -- foolishly, considering just about everyone at my table got individual pizzas, which are way too huge and should be shared! I got vegan black bean soup of the day ($3), which was decent but a little bland -- I loved the crunchy texture of the soup from the veggies, though.  For my pizza, I got a simple cheese pizza with olives ($12), which I could only eat two out of six slices of. The pizza was really crispy, almost burnt on the edges, and it just wasn't my favorite type of pizza -- I much prefer the floppier style of Cibo.  Still, it's nice to have another central Phoenix pizza option, and it's right across the street from the to-die-for Churn -- which alone makes the trip to Federal Pizza worth it.",

Makes it very easy and convenient. Especially when the parking lot and restaurant are both jam packed. The pizza itself had a lot of flavor. I love doughy crusts rather than crispy and it was the perfect amount of doughiness. The meatballs also had a great flavor. I am very picky when it comes to meatballs and you can tell that they are made fresh. I had a hard time choosing between this pizza or the At Last which included a bunch of veggies. So I'll definitely be back to try that one another time.",

    "text": "Love the look and feel of this joint. We grabbed a late dinner here but were surprised to learn there was still a 20 minute wait.   We moseyed on over to the bar where we were greeted by a nice bartender.  Hubby and I both wanted a break from all that beer from watching baseball so we went easy with their delicious-sounding wine coolers.  I ordered a strawberry rhubarb and hubby went with the blueberry hibiscus.  From what I can tell, it's syrup + sparking wine??  Both were very tasty and refreshing.  I inquired whether this was available to go (like their beer and wine) but alas, it was not.  We got seated and took a few minutes to peruse the menu, eventually ordering a side of their meatball, their polenta sticks, the TLC salad (split for us in the kitchen) and the brussels sprout pizza.  Meatball was of good solid construction and the sauce it came with really impressed.  The best part of our meal really was the polenta but it was also the component that made us feel REALLY guilty.  Polenta sticks were fried and served with their version of the Romesco sauce (creamy).  Mind-numbingly and heart-stoppingly tasty.  We had to force ourselves to stop and save room for the salad and the pizza.  The salad came next and was very well made and delicious.  Hubby didn't appreciate the large chunks of pears but I was fine with it.  The pizza came and frankly, this was the least impactful of our dishes.  Or maybe perplexing.  I know, we made the decision to order a pizza with brussels sprouts on it...but somehow the flavors just didn't come together for us.  We ended up taking a large part of it to go and snacking on it just a little bit in our hotel room.  We killed the leftover polenta sticks a few hours later but unfortunately, being cold didn't make the brussels sprouts taste any better on the pizza. (And I do love me some brussels sprouts!)  Service was friendly and very helpful.  Our server was sweet and totally reminded me of a friend of ours.  We would totally return if only to try another pizza and have more wine coolers...many, many more...",

I ordered a pepperoni pizza. The pizza is one of the best I had. It had a unique flavor and it is wood fried. The crust is very crunchy and the tomato sauce is very good!!! The restaurant was very cozy with a lounge like atmosphere. They have a full bar with plenty of TVs. Next time I will come enjoy pizza and drink a few beers. Really cool place!!

    "text": "Ok, so I've only been here once.  It was at a meeting a week ago with my work.  Best tip is that the parking is absolutely horrible, so come early or late, because the lot is so small and there is nothing on the street.  That being said,  I arrived with 5 other people and was greeted and seated warmly.   The waitress arrived promptly for drinks and orders.  I opted to get a classic, the margharita pizza with fresh mozz, tomatoes and basil, plus I added  roasted garlic.  It was delicious, with fresh hot house tomatoes, fresh torn basil leaves, stringy melted mozzarella, with garlic cloves mild and roasted to a perfect creaminess  and the crust was both delicate and chewy, exactly what you'd expect in a well executed pizza, but the absolute STAR and the one all my co-workers remember is the sweet potato and ricotta pizza.  It sounds unusual,  and it IS! Thin rounds of sweet potato roasted into the chewy, pillowy crust with generous dollops of creamy ricotta cheese and fresh sage scattered with it.  One of my co-workers shared it, a single slice each,  but THAT is the pizza we all remember and dream about!  Sweet, but not TOO sweet, creamy and luscious! It was like nothing I've ever had before.  And at $13 I thought it a bargain!  If I hadn't been headed out of town after our meeting I would have gotten one to bring home to my husband! I hope I am able to make it that way again,  just for this luscious, decadent treat.  I'm not a pizza  fan overall,  after 16 yrs in AZ I thought I wouldn't like pizza again,  but THIS pizza is one well worth a trip to central Phoenix!",

He came back and gave us money that was supposed to be for the tip and told us that we were rude and kids like us need to learn how to tip. We very kindly and calmly told him the money he gave us back was for the tip. He told us that \"if that is the case then I eat my words\" but never actually apologized for the incident.

I got the manifesto add brussels and he got the caprese sandwich. The pizza was alright, but it just didn't have the flavor it had the last time...it was boring for having so many ingredients. The sandwich was also pretty boring...definitely nothing special. I also had one of their strawberry wine cooler and I was not a fan....it wasn't very sweet and it had a lot of ice, which made it hard to drink. I just thought it was ok overall.....the bad part actually happened today. I reheated a couple slices in the toaster oven and the cheese turned totally plastic -y! I have no idea how that happened, but it was pretty gross. This makes me not really want to have their pizza again, especially since half of the (not so cheap) pizza went in the trash.",

If not, I've also had the At Last pizza and was not disappointed. What makes a good pizza in my opinion is the crust, and the crust has the oven fired taste. It's somewhat crispy, thin, and has an authentic Italian taste. Honestly, at Federal you are mainly there for the trendy environment and experience. Sit outside on the patio and enjoy some wine.

From what I saw you can sit outside, inside in booths (most booths are for smaller parties but I did see one large booth) at the bar and at a smaller bar by the kitchen. I think the parking might be valet for dinner... but at happy hour it appeared to be self park.   The service is top notch, it's actually why I wanted to write this review. Our server was great and so were all the food runners, bartenders and other servers we interacted with (really rare among good looking hospitality industry peeps in phoenix). Oh, and we live walking distance away and I am wishing they had a bike rack... Service is so stellar... my boyfriend (who is a chef) and I are still talking about it.",

I ordered a wine cooler since they are pretty popular as it was very strong and refreshing. We ordered a chop salad to split and it was one of the best chop salads we had! Wish it was larger since our split portion of the meatball was on the smaller side.  Pizza was good. Service could have been way better also.",

    "text": "Some might call me a super-fan, but when Upward Projects does something, you can't help but love it. In the game of artisan pizza, Federal kneads out the competition.   Having tried most pizzas from their menu, I've landed on the Manifesto as my normal order. I love the Manifesto, with exception of the mushrooms, so when I order it, I always sub for brussels sprouts instead, sometimes I'm feeling a little frisky and have them throw sweet potato on there too. Not only are they happy to make these changes for me, but the server usually says something like \"That sounds delicious, I need to try it!\"  The manifesto, with goat cheese, red sauce, fennel, schriener's sausage, and brussels sprouts is delish. The toppings are always super fresh, the crust is a bit crispier than most other artisan pizza's from around town and the service is always excellent.  $12 - $15 will buy you a pizza sized well enough for one hungry dude or in my case, large enough for two to share. Joining their email posse will usually score you a free pizza once or twice a year for things like your birthday or promotions they feel like running.  Their vegetable side is neither here nor there in my opinion, likely because I don't love carrots, but the broccolini were delish.   If you're a dessert fan (remember two deSSerts and one deSert, in case you can never remember how to spell dessert or desert for that matter) they generally always have a fruit cobbler of some sort. If it's mixed berry, you must order it, dessert fans everywhere insist. Oddly enough, I don't order dessert at many places, mostly because I'm generally looking out for my figure, but in this case, I wouldn't be eating pizza either, but when I am, I sometimes order dessert. Go all out right? ;-)  Enough rambling and back to the part we're all waiting for... the end of this review.  Always delish, always fresh, and no one has ever actually gotten fresh with me while dining here, not yet at least.   Happy Yelping Phoenix!",

I asked about the wine coolers and the waitress responded with \"i hate them\" I probed further and she indicated she didn't care for sweet but I was a bit surprised by her bluntness. We shared a ceasar salad which was a great portion size and very tasty (perhaps a bit salty) and a pizza with Shriner's sausage (yum) and gorgonzola. The pizza was good, one of the better ones I have had in Central Phoenix but not the best. I would come back and will probably sit inside or order through the cute drive -thru.",

Once you enter the restaurant, you automatically can see that it's a modern restaurant that appeals to the hip and chic vibe that many people are attracted to. The workers are friendly and the crowds of people waiting or eating tells you that this place has captured the attention of hundreds. During the daytime, the atmosphere gives off a serene vibe that allows you to relax. At nighttime, the place transforms into a nighttime joint full of a variety of music and a friendly vibe that is carried through the immaculate service of the workers.   The food is, in short, delicious. They have a unique variety of pizzas that are nothing short of yummy. The best part of their pizzas are that they're handmade by the chefs that work vigorously in the back. Although pizza is the food of focus, their salads, pasta, as well as other selections on the menu do not betray the word delicious.   If you are looking for a place to eat lunch during the day or somewhere to chillax during the night, Federal Pizza is your choice!",

Add to it a dog-friendly patio, and that's just over the top bonus.  When we drive to Phoenix, we're driving 500 miles and for about 10 hours.  We're tired when we hit town, and we want to sit down to good food.  But we're also lazy, and it's usually late when we leave our house, so the other places that we like are closed.  Federal is open until 11pm, which works so well for us!  And on our last trip, we got their Casanova pizza -- MAJOR goodness!  Prosciutto, dates, ricotta, arugula, pecorino and balsamic vinaigrette.  WOW.  It was nothing short of fabulous.  There's a pub near our house that we go to occasionally that has bacon-wrapped dates with a balsamic drizzle, and that's about the only dates that I eat - well, this pizza has made me much more a fan of dates.  So now I have a new favorite pizza at Federal.  The service is always top-notch, Greg was great.  And here's something that he did that was brilliant, and I hope it's S.O.P. at Federal and should be at all restaurants: when he brought us our credit card charge slip to sign, he'd tested the pen that he gave us to make sure it worked!  Top marks, Greg!  We'll be back.  It may only be 3-4 times a year, but we'll be back.  And we always recommend it to friends.",

    "text": "We decided to stop at Federal Pizza based on the rating that it received on Yelp. The reviews could not have been more accurate, the place is great.  When you drive up you will realize that Federal Pizza is in the old First Federal Bank.  They kept the drive-through and use it for pickup. The parking lot looks a lot like it did in the 50's when the bank was there.  This may be the friendliest place we have ever been to. Even the customers were friendly. We sat at the bar because the place was busy and we did not have a reservation. That turned out to be a great decision. We interacted with three bartenders. All of them were engaging, brought us tastes of the beers, took our order and served us the beer and pizza that we ordered.  The pizzas are pretty big - more than enough for one person. But the list was so good that we decided to order two. A Pineapple Express (hawaiian plus Calabrian Chili and Chives) and a Meatball (Meatballs, Federal Cheese Blend, House Mozz, Red Sauce, Basil and Wood Roasted Onions).  The pizzas were excellent! We enjoyed the whole experience so much that we took advantage of their Black Friday deal and purchased gift cards - even though this is not very close to our place in Scottsdale.  We will definitely go back!",

The five of us were starving and we love Federal Pizza, and were only about 15 minutes away and saw that they'd be open for another hour and a half. Yay!   So my husband and I got there first. At 10:58pm. The guy who greets us (Tom) at the door says hey so we're open until 12 midnight, but our kitchen closes in 2 minutes. I said I had no idea, we looked you up and it said you were open until midnight but we didn't know the kitchen closes at 11. It's totally okay, we can go somewhere else (genuinely). Tom so graciously said are you sure? I'm happy to let you see the menu, do you know what you want? It looks like the kitchen still has another ticket. If you order in the next few minutes we can make it happen.   I told him how we would feel bad, we didn't want to do that to him and the staff. But he so kindly didn't make us feel bad at all. He seriously was incredibly kind, and so was our waitress Morgan. For two people who are working late on a Friday night and I'm sure have much better things to do, they sure did make us feel so welcome.   The food was per usual, amazing. Out of the five of us, one had never been to Federal Pizza, and this was an amazing first experience for her.   I genuinely promise to never be \"that person\" again who shows up at closing time, but even though we definitely were those people this time, we still had a stellar experience. Thanks Tom & Morgan!!",

We had put it off for a few months, because frankly there are a lot of really good pizza joints in Phoenix. Thankfully she suggested it tonight, because I really love Federal Pizza now. The ambiance was cool, TVs has March Madness on, and the food was really good. Our server was top notch, knew all of the specials, and was quick to make suggestions if we were unsure what to order. Excellent beer menu, if you're into craft beers, and the fiancee really enjoyed her wine cooler, per yelp suggestions. We had the Brussel sprout appetizer to start, which was good, but not mind blowing. The pizza though was top notch. I got a plain ole pepperoni and she got the At Last pizza. So freaking good. Both of them. I liked hers possibly more but I can't because I'm a meat eating beer drinking man. Jk but seriously good. You should try federal pizza. We want to eat outside next, I'm sure it will be great.",

Federal Pizza is by far the most agreeable top pizza joint in Phoenix amongst my group of friends.  The dim lights and classy wooden architecture makes it a great place for family, friends, or any other occasions. They also have a to go option.   I have picked the pineapple express because pizza is always better with pineapples. This is not fake news. In addition to the juicy pineapples, the hand crafted pizza consist of prosciutto, calabrian chili, and chives where an explosion of flavor is experienced in each bite. With no shame, I have demolished the entire 12inch pizza by myself in one setting. 2,000+ calories later, I still highly recommend this place. I'm happy to continue my search for the best pizza in Phoenix.",

To top it off all the pizza's are cooked in a brick oven,  adding the wood fired flavors!

For some reason, we had always steered away from trying Federal. Maybe it was because it's the same owners of Postino and they do bruschetta so well we thought there was no way they could do pizza well? I'm honestly not sure, but 2 weekends ago we decided we wanted to go somewhere new for date night and landed on Federal. We were NOT disappointed!  I had the pizza (can't remember the name) that comes with arugula, ricotta cheese, figs, and proscuitto and it might be my new favorite meal. My husband had another pizza that was equally as good (I can't remember what he had because I was way too interested in my own food) and a coffee beer that he said was the best coffee beer he had ever had. Our service was great, the food was bomb, and we loved it so much we decided to come back last weekend with my sister in law!  My sis in law happens to be gluten free and it can be challenging for her to find good pizza, but apparently this place hit the spot. She said that their GF dough was as good as the real thing, which is saying a lot if you know anyone who is GF.",

The arancini has cilantro inside!  Ewwww. I am a cilantro hater so that was deadly.   For dinner we ordered the meatball pizza and lamb bolognese. The bolognese was super, super gamey and they serve it with the wrong kind of pasta. The sauce doesn't cling well to it so you get blandish pasta and then a pile of sauce next to it. Not tasty.   The pizza was ok but nothing compared to a place like Pizzeria Bianca. Not even the same league.   We were so disappointed we decided to go someplace else for dessert...",

We got the tiramisu on our first visit and it was one of the best we had ever tasted, we agreed on that! There were these doughnut type balls as well and they were tasty but heavy and thick. Who goes to a pizza place for doughnut balls anyway, go for the pizza and let them pile that parmesan cheese high because, yes, they put it on for you!",

I would understand if it was some kind of special artisan bread, but it wasn't. Not only that, but they served it burnt. I never send food back because of that notion that they might spit on your food (never had it happen here just fyi) but BURNT BREAD!? Also, nothing to accompany this dry burnt bread like butter of olive oil.   Disappointed.",

In terms of flavors and prices it definitely checks all the boxes. We all split the seasonal salad to start. It was a kale salad with squash, figs, pomegranate, pear. Supposedly there were mushroom in it as well, but we didn't find too many. Then we ordered the Margherita and At Last pizzas. The Margherita has classic flavors with thinly sliced tomatoes and an obviously fresh made mozzarella topped with fresh basil. The At Last pizza is a little different. It's a summery pizza with a fresh lemon zest that adds a different twist on a typical pizza flavor combination.",

    "text": "Stopped by Federal Pizza for work function and had the chance to try a couple of their salads and pies. I liked the vibe and staff, but food carries the weight in my reviews and I overall think the grub was just okay.  Here is my thoughts:  Federal chop salad-was the better of the two salads I had. I recall it had pepperoni, pepperoncini, provolone, and a vinaigrette among other things. It was good and had the flavor of a antipasto salad but just lacked substance in my opinion.  Harvest salad-It had squash, pumpkin seeds, blue cheese, etc. but just lacked the strong flavor I was expecting. Okay, but not great.  Sweet Potato Pizza-Again I was expecting strong flavor but it was just okay. I assumed it would be on the sweet side which I was hoping for but felt it was bland.   Sweet Corn Pizza-It was better than the sweet potato and had stronger flavor. Would never think of ordering this type of pie but it was pretty good.  Meatball Pizza-The big winner amongst all the food I tried. The meatball was very flavorful and the cheese was on point. The sauce was bold with this pie and really what I was looking for. Five star worthy.  Overall, would I stop by again? Maybe. I just was not blown away with this gourmet pizza establishment and would prefer a few other joints instead.",

We had two kids with us and the wait staff was very accommodating with two high chairs and colors for them to play with. We ordered the vegetable board and pizza to share. The kids also got a small pizza and pasta to share. It arrived pretty quickly. It was delicious! The roasted plate of veggies with a hummus type of sauce was great. Very flavorful and full of great stuff- on the healthier side of course. The pizza was very tasty. I forgot the name but it was sweet tasting! It had dates, and thick cheese with a few different types of meats. They have a great pizza and wine special during the week as well! A must try in central Phoenix!",

The salads are a complete ripoff. They were $5 each and tiny. TINY. The pasta dish was about the size of a salad plate and was $16.  We probably won't go for anything except for the occasional pizza.

We ordered Brussels sprouts and cheese/risotto balls (Arancini) appetizers, The Magnificent sandwich, Chef's Whim pizza (chicken, collard greens, ribeye gravy, pickled watermelon, cheese), cannoli and Bombolini (homemade donuts and chocolate sauce). We loved everything we ordered. It's nice to find original menus that make you want to try everything.   Ari was kind enough to make my wine selection effortless by choosing for me. I had the new Rose wine. Perfect pairing with my meal and refreshing.   Relaxing and casual atmosphere. We were on the patio. I usually worry about patio service but they didn't miss a beat and our drinks were always full. We were even there during a shift change and didn't feel a thing in our service. Ari was amazing and Angie stepped right in and was just as awesome. Kara stopped by to check on our experience a few times and was very personable.   This restaurant is 25 miles oneway from our home.

Those guys and gals at Upwards Projects definitely know how to create a winning restaurant!   My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch and can't wait to come back. Since it was such a nice day, we sat on the cute patio and were able to enjoy the slight breeze. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We ordered the Mister Mister - a platter of deep friend goodies. This included sweet potato, zucchini, artichokes, and mozzarella. The mozzarella was definitely my favorite. I liked the other vegetables as well, but the artichokes (which I normally love) didn't really do it for me. The leaves were too crispy.   For our pizza, we ordered the Brussels Sprout - roasted brussels sprouts, pancetta, and manchego cheese. Oh. Man. New favorite pizza. The crust was soft and crunchy, the sprouts were well cooked and tasty, and I loved the bite of the cheese. Mmm. We took home our leftovers and ate it for dinner that night! I would go back for this pizza alone, but they also have several other pizzas that look delicious.   I also want to go back to try their cobbler dessert (made with Churn ice cream) and I heard their homemade wine coolers are good. I'll definitely be back and soon!",

Had the 1/2 Manifesto pizza and 1/2 Federal Chop salad and was not disappointed. Partner had the whole Pineapple Express pizza and a side salad and they were winners also. The best part is you can park right there. None of the valet parking nonsense that is happening all over Phoenix. If the restaurant requires you to valet then I don't spend my money there. Excellent place to eat and we will be back soon.",

I'm sure they have better pizzas than that one, so I'm giving three stars on potential.  Also, when you order this pizza, make sure you finish it because it didn't make a good cold pizza.  They're so hip, they give you chili flakes and parmesan cheese in dimebags to aid your pizza fix.",

    "text": "I had a great time last weekend.  My hubby had been talking about Federal Pizza and I have been reading all the reviews, that I couldn't wait to visit.  We were worried we couldn't get a table, because I've heard the wait it a little long.  We decided ahead of time that we were going to sit at the bar.  When we got there, we valet, got inside and there were two seats open right in the middle of the bar area, score.  We ordered the Manifesto, and since lately I've been easing my way into beers, I asked for some advise and the recommendation was great, it was the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, I liked it a lot.  My hubby had the Four Peaks one.  The place was buzzing with energy and the servers were working really hard.  It had been about 20 minutes after we ordered and I saw a pizza coming by, it went straight from us to another person at the bar who I thought had gotten there after us, hum, ok, maybe I didn't realize they were here.  Ten minutes later, a server/manager? approached us and apologized for having given our pizza away and they made another one and they told us it was on them.  That was very classy, because I really didn't know it that pizza I saw go by was mine and they could have just said the kitchen was backed up.  Thank you again, Federal Pizza for being so aware and caring about your performance.  This was a Saturday early evening and there were people from every age range.  We also had the chopped salad which was delicious and for dessert my hubby had been raving about the berry cobbler.  I can't wait to come back.  I have so many items I want to try.",

My husband and I sat right up at the counter overlooking the kitchen & wood-fire oven. It was busy & lively. I had a mushroom & green pepper pizza which was good, but I think I will go for one of their pizza creations next time. They look interesting & possibly delicious. I was really impressed with their \"Great Little Salad\" for $4... It wasn't your usual iceberg, carrot & ranch dressing side salad. It truly was a great & a cheap addition to my pizza! I cannot wait to order a pizza for pick up & pick it up via their drive-thru. How cool huh? Every parent's dream!!! ;-)",

    "text": "I visited Federal Pizza on a trip out West to see family.  When my brother suggested going to a pizza place I was thinking, no way!  I eat at some of the best pizza places in the world on the regular out on the East Coast.  Federal Pizza more than met my high expectations.    The Pizza was perfectly cooked and wood fired.  The toppings were inspired.  I was very impressed with their appetizers and salads as well.  It was so great that I went back again before leaving.  The Burrata with fresh baked bread was a great start.  The cheese is mild and spreadable and the bread is toasted to perfection.  We also cooled off with happy hour house made wine coolers.  They had a great beer selection as well.    I tried the meatball, manifesto, big star, and casanova pizzas.  The casanova and meatball were perfect for sharing because of their more intense flavors.  The big star and manifesto were more traditional, but with an artisanal kick.    Another great bonus with this place is that they source some of their products locally.  The sausage is made right down the street at Schreiners Sausages.    The staff is definitely hipster cool, but really helpful and excited about the food and drinks.  They made some excellent suggestions and made sure we had everything we needed.   The location is the perfect fit.  It's in an old bank building from the 50's and helps make this place have mid-century charm.  The decorations are also clearly somewhat Mad Men inspired.  But, the whole place feels so modern and clean at the same time... it's no time capsule.  You really can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Yeah, you read that right: 5 stars. Based on last night, it could not possibly have gone any better than it did. A friend of mine, Noelle, had her birthday dinner there last night. There were ten of us in the party. We ordered a few pizzas to share and some of us ordered appetizers as well. I almost gobbled up an entire pizza. I'm not kidding.  Sweet baby jesus. The polenta side was nothing short of amazing. Sticks of polenta, deep-fried and then rolled in freshly grated parmesan. It was served with a side of some sort of crazy good sauce on the side. When the order arrived, everyone around me was eyeing my plate. I shared, of course, but not very willingly. I am drooling as I write this, by the way. One of the pizzas we ordered, the Manifesto, was really good. I had 3 pieces! We also ordered the Margherita, the 4-cheese, and one that was covered in fresh greens. I don't even care about the name of it, that's how good it was. One of the girls brought Noelle a gift basket of wines. During the dinner, the basket tipped and one of the wine bottles fell out and smashed on the floor. Noelle cries over spilled wine. Federal Pizza replaced the bottle! It wasn't even bought there! How cool is that? Service was impeccable. I'm a thirsty person. My drink never emptied enough for me to ask for a refill. We were there for 3 hours and the servers we had never forgot about us. Well, it's not like they could. We're an unforgettable crowd.",

The aptly named Casanova stole my heart. As I read through the list of pies all sounded good, but the Casanova was a notch above the rest.  Its description read like a really alluring internet dating profile.  Prosciutto, dates and ricotta might as well have read well educated, good family, great smile, arugula was just icing on the cake, like having the same favorite band.  I was sold.   We all know a well written e-harmony profile does not insure success.  What looks great on paper does not necessarily equate to that special spark.  I nervously waited for my pizza, hoping it would be everything I hoped for.  Meanwhile I enjoyed a wine cooler. Not the \"hey look guys, I totally scored us some booze\" Bartles & Jaymes wine coolers of my teenage years, no these were more sophisticated and much tastier. I went with the raspberry lavender and was very pleased.  17 year old me was soo jelly. Then he arrived.  On time, dressed neatly.  I coyly eyed him before grabbing a slice, then dove right in. People, the sparks were there.  Love exists, it's real.  The Casanova was everything I had dreamed of.   I don't want to get to ahead of myself, but I for-see a long and happy relationship.",

However, let me make myself clear my Love of Federal pizza does not stem from any kind of stupendous customer service experience I have had at the restaurant. In fact I love, going here so much exactly because my experiences with their customer service are so hilariously bad. Let me attempt to explain my oxymoronic explanation of my relationship with Federal Pizza. This restaurant does not have bad customer service on purpose like one of those restaurants that are rude to you on purpose. In fact the wait staff does not seem to have an attitude problem at all and they have always seemed very pleasant. The problem appears to either be a problem with the culture at the restaurant or with their management. Every time I have eaten here I have had to have a meal comped, receiving a voucher for a future meal comp, or redeeming a meal comp because they can never get my order right. Even one time when I came in to redeem a meal comp for a free entree, the waitress forgot to put in my order and it took nearly and hour and a half to get my food! And because the waitress sucked so bad she had to give me 2 more freebees for future visits! This is why I love getting such bad service, because when this happens they feed me for free! Over the past several months eating at Federal has been a huge cution to my budget. I swear to god I make more money eating at this restaurant than I have actually spent here. In the past 3 times I have eaten here I think I have only had to spend $3 when I went in today because my drink was not covered on one of the vouchers they gave me. But even when I went in today the bartender freakin walked off the bar leaving me with nobody to refill my drink or give me my check. Another waitress eventually came over and took care of it but she was acting overwhelmed. Bottom line I will eat here for free and put up with the shitty customer service. The food is good so I don't mind having to wait for it. I just have to make sure when I go in that I don't have any other plans for the day, because I practically spend all afternoon there. Also, every time I  have go there I go by myself. I would be embarrassed to take a date to this place because most of the time I go in they treat me like I am not even there. Anyway: Federal Pizza thanks for feeding me for the past couple of months. But seriously WTF is wrong with you people. Don't your servers live on tips? Don't you have to make a profit off of people who come to your restaurant. Like seriously you people need to get your shit together. Then again, I will gladly continue eating at your restaurant for free in return by being ignored by your wait staff. LMAO.",

    "text": "It was our  wedding anniversary and the kids were at Grandma's. It was a Wednesday night. We were both finally off work, it was 8pm, and we wanted to try to fit in a little date to celebrate another year down. I was in the mood for pizza, so of course, we turn to Yelp. We wanted somewhere good, but not good enough to require me to get all fancied up. The reviews looked promising, so we said \"what the hey..\"  The weather was just chilly enough to not want to sit outside. We couldn't find the entrance, so we walked a circle around the entire building. It was a nice walk. We got to assess (and by assess I mean \"gossip about\") some couples on the patio. That was fun. Walked in, greeted right away by a nice lady. Sat at a table by the patio door. The view was nice. The bar was pretty. The crowd was a little bit hipster, a little bit normal people. It looked like there were a lot of first dates happening. Those are fun to watch.  The server was super sweet, I love that they're all wearing normal clothes.   The food was pretty good. We got some sort of appetizer, I forgot what it was called as soon as I ordered it. It looked like a whole bunch of fried stuff all piled together (not greasy gross fried, just fried), with 2 different dipping sauces. One green, one red. The red was better. For an entree, we shared a pizza. It was okay. We got the Big Star because all the others looked a little too weird (apple and sausage?... hmm) For dessert, we had doughnuts with the chocolate sauce. We got them because they make a similar dessert at Olive Garden, and we are obsessed with them. Well... I hate to say this, because I love small businesses, but olive garden's doughnut and chocolate sauce is a lot better. So it was a huge disappointment, but that's not necessarily their fault. Our expectations were probably too high. We also split a pitcher of beer. The total bill was 40 bucks plus tip. Not too shabby.  When we left, like, 5 employees smiled and said \"bye!! thanks for coming in!!\" Where did they find such pleasant people? I like it.",

Didn't get much of the balsamic but still enjoyable.  Then the Meatball Pizza. Please keep in mind that I have been incredibly spoiled when it comes to pizza being from NY and having traveled throughout Italy.  Overall, very good and a premium product. Sauce could have a bit more Pop however the understated tomato sauce let the very delicious meatball and caramelized onion flavor sing!  Crust/dough, also very well done but not the best I have had either.    Overall, very enjoyable and great service from Josh at the bar!  Well done guys.   Your Truly,   The Official Pizza Snob : )",

    "text": "I asked my girlfriend is she wanted pizza. We searched by reviews as well as a new place to try and found Federal. Tucked in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood, it was daunting at first to see a full parking lot. As we walked up we noticed a Drive Thru of a sort which makes to go orders fast and easy.  FIRST THINGS FIRST: If you want a hole in the wall, mom and pop, Italian kitchen greasy pizza, this isn't your spot for today's meal.  HOWEVER:  If you want something filling, light, gourmet, and unique to your taste buds, I highly recommend Federal Pizza.  Pros: Everything tastes as if it's made in house. Flavor crossovers I didn't think would work on pizza, but absolutely do. The cooks can be seen making your food. There are handmade wine coolers for the day drinkers. The plating is lovely and the portions are good. The atmosphere is very hip. *Emily is a great server.* There are yummy vegetarian options.  Cons: aside from the alcoholic beverages in which I do not partake, there are limited drink options to the fountain standards. There aren't jalapenos or blue cheese which are a must when I snag a pizza (but on that note, this is the kind of place where every meal or pizza is specific for a reason, and that works in a place like this.)  We got the lunch which is just under $10 per person for a half pizza and your choice of salad or soup. Girlfriend got the soup which was a cauliflower fennel combination (weird but satisfying and vegetarian.) I picked a salad with citrusy stuff in it. The pizza she chose was a cheese pizza (she fears change sometimes) and I snagged one with goat cheese, lemon zest, OMG other goodies.  4.5/10 give it a shot for new and hot.",

The Meatball pizza is delicious and definitely one that I can't seem to stop ordering. The meatballs are sliced thinly and are reminiscent of meatloaf -- rich, hearty and well seasoned. I personally like to add ricotta, just my thing. Though beware, it tends to make the crust slightly soggy (I don't mind).  If you're in the mood to make a mess, order the grilled artichoke, I swear it's worth the price.  So happy that I can walk here from my house.  The servers are super friendly and not too pretentiously hipster.  I do with they served cocktails...",

A pizza plus a bottle of wine (or two pitchers of beer) for just $20 after 8pm. Best of all, the deal is available for takeout too. It's really an incredible deal. You're basically paying retail for the wine and getting the pizza for free!  And it's really good pizza. It might even be my favorite, but I can't bring myself to make that kind of statement on the record. The crust is so flavorful and crisp. I'm glad they don't shellac it in oil like they do at LGO, another contender in my favorite pizza category. While Grimaldi's might be my favorite pizza close to home, Federal really has them beat when it comes to toppings. I've had the sweet potato, veggie, potato and date pizzas so far, and I've loved them all.  Is there a way to bottle the wine coolers to go? If I could get a growler full of the watermelon mint variety, my summer would be complete.",

I have had pizza in the best places in New York, Phoenix, San Francisco and San Diego- not one of them comes close to Federal Pizza at all. Great ambience and service - Highly recommend ASAP!",

There was a group of 6 of us. Four of us got the chicken panzanella which was OK but the chicken was very dry and the salad was nothing special except it was a healthy salad. The pizza was OK. The person who got the ravioli LOVED IT!  We felt it was very overpriced since the food was, for the most part, only mediocre.",

The pizza was so yummy! I went with two friends, and we each got different pizzas to try them out, and swapped leftovers to take home a variety. Yes, it was good even when I heated it up later.   I'll go again at dinner time and post a follow-up review once I try drinks and maybe a salad.",

    "text": "Satisfaction Guaranteed! I was feeling Italian tonight so i insisted to go here. We sat at the kitchen bar because there was a 30min wait, of coarse dinner rush.. I've tried the margherita before so that's what I ordered and my boyfriend ordered meatball spaghetti. As expected, the pizza was good. I love how the tomatoes are cooked, blackened a little bit by the fired-brick oven. Our pasta came, so i tried it first. I don't know if it's undercooked but it was kinda hard, which I didn't mind. My boyfriend tried it and he also agreed. So we just kept eating our pizza, since we ate at the kitchen bar, the pizza chef asked us how our pizza was? We replied good! But i told him about the pasta was hard. So he told the other chef who made it. The chef then came to us and asked us if he can make a new one. I'm glad that they went above our expectations and did something about it, without us asking to prepare a new one. They also didn't charge me for the meatball spaghetti. We will definitely come back to try the answer (pizza) which was recommended by the pizza chef.",
