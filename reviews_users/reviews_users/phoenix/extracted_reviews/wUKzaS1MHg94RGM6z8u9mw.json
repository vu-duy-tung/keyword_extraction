    "text": "This place used to have a pretty good atmosphere and fun crowd. However the last two times I've visited, my experiences were pretty bad.    A couple of months ago I had a rude bartender too busy chatting up some guys to take my drink order, it was like she intentionally refused to take her eye off her dude and acknowledge me in the hopes we would give up and go away.  When she finally asked if we needed anything she got my drink wrong.  I ordered a vodka & soda with a splash of grenadine and she gave me a vodka & 7up.  Of course it was SUCH a hassle to remake it the way I asked that I got the bitchy eye roll and sigh.  The last time I was there a few weeks ago, my friend and I were told we had to leave the couches we'd been sitting at for over 30 minutes because all the tables outside were reserved. We stayed at the bar inside for at least 30 more minutes and never saw the patio get even half full.  In addition, the flat bread we'd ordered outside got \"lost\" when the waitress couldn't find us so we had to order again.  We finally got our appetizer about 45 minutes after we first ordered and it came out burned.  Gee, thanks.  It's a great space, I love the decor, and I really wish I liked it as much as I used to.  But the food, the service, the crowd are all just \"Meh\" now; what a waste.",

    "text": "Hey Fox concepts: Is it your concept to be consistently Rude to customers. Wake Up.  This is strike 2 for this restaurant. I will not bring my customers again. You have to have a meeting of you hostesses wait staff and management. Last Thursday I walked in with 3 peaple. I was told 3 times that is 5:00 and no happy hr on the patio  with tables  So Ok rude hostess.... fine.  The waitress...  3 times are you dinning. Wine appetizers then we shall see.  She did not like that answer and rudely sat us.  The appetizers were very Small and just Ok.  We had 2 bottles of wine but the waitress kept  on asking about food to the point where we decided to have dinner else ware. We are locals fox not Snowbirds.  Today I walked in at 11:30 we were 4 peaple. Same attitude.   Sorry their is  an 1/12/ hr wait . We only take reservations and you do not have one. Hardly anyone was on the patio at that time......  A manager walk by and asked how we were doing . I said Not Ok . And she just ignored my comment and walked on her very busy way. My 1st time customers and friends reminded me that their is Plenty of restaurants in the are that want our bussiness. So we left....   To note ... Fox . That we told this story to a neighboring restaurant and he agreed that you guys Turn Off more people and that's great for this bussness.  If you care this was at 11:30 today.. Check the time sheets .....  I doubt if I will give you a 3 rd time because My Time is valuable also ...",

Atmosphere is what makes this place stand out. The complimentary pesto and focaccia is to die for. Great wine list and drink specials. Mediterranean Mule is my favorite. Service is always spectacular.  I would highly recommend checking this place out!!!",

After being seated we waited ten minutes before anyone even came over to get a drink order or give us water, and it was a server from another section that felt bad for us.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that literally nothing was good which is why I don't feel the need to go into more detail.  I had much higher hopes given the ratings here, and so I write this in the hopes that possibly even one person will be spared the same experience.",

We got seated at the patio .The foods were exelent,good quality  ,well presented and good  portion.The reasons behind giving this restaurant a three starts are  1- the pesone who I talked to make the reservation at 9:15 didn't mentioned that the kitchen closing at 10 ,so we got rushed and we didn't have enough time to enjoy having  our salad . 2- The waitrest that she was taking care of us was not friendly and doest have any kind of customer service skills . I understand she might be tired but I don't think one smile would be hard to be expressed . 3-   After we finished the dinner,we asked her to bring a cake in order celebrate my wife birthday .She said there is 2 $ fees will be charged per person .  It kind of wired , our check is 200$ and they still asking us to pay\" fees \". There no value of the 2$  in these days and if I paid it will not  affect to my budget BUT it's all about principles and customer satisfaction.",

I have been dying to try these, and I've been through PHX 3 times this year, but have not been able to get them once.  Apparently they don't have them for lunch, and they sell out really quickly for dinner.  For the food I actually got, the bacon wrapped pork loin was heavenly.  It sits on a bed of squash that absorb the bacon/pork flavor.  I almost licked the plate.  The watermelon salad was also good.  The dressing is sweet, but has a slight kick of savory pepper.  I had it for lunch once, but I think I might order for desert next time I go.  Speaking of desert, the huckleberry cheesecake was momentous.  It's served in mini-mason jars, which some of my colleges got a kick out of.  The service has been outstanding every time I've been there.  Both waiters I've had demonstrated extensive knowledge of the wine list and menu and made great recommendations.  The scenery isn't too bad either.",

We had a group of 9 and ordered the bacon wrapped dates (with sausage filling), artichoke hearts, and the white and red sangria for the table. Upon seeing that we were there for a bachelorette, the waiter brought us a round of shots!  Some girls in our group are pescatarian and vegan, and the waiter and chefs prepared breaking/dairy on the side for our appetizers and food. I really was impressed by the accommodations they made for us. Not to mention - they brought out cake and a scoop of sorbet for the bride-to-be!!   Highly recommend this restaurant for group events or even for a romantic dinner. Next time I'm in AZ, I'll definitely revisit!",

When I walked in, the hostess was gossiping so loudly with one of the servers, and I usually wouldn't care, but they were complaining about another server (I think) and it was just so nasty and it really put a bad taste in my mouth. They ignored me until they were done with their conversation, too, so it was really awkward for me.   So after my awkward/distasteful beginning, I get seated. The server comes over and asks what we would like to drink - I order a fig and ginger mule, and my friend ordered some sangria. We also order the calamari and veggies to start. The server brought me my mule, but forgot the sangria. Fifteen minutes later, the app comes out, and it is cold. Still no sign of my friends sangria. We mention that the calamari was cold to our server, who says that just happens sometimes but that it seemed pretty warm when it was brought out. We were confused by the response, but its whatever. We order dinner - Ahi tuna for me, pesto chicken for my friend. It takes forever to come out. Still no sangria for my friend, which we pretty much just give up on at this point.   The food came and it was good, which is why this is 2 stars instead of 1. It took a very long time on a very un-busy night for our food to come out, so I'm not sure if our waiter forgot to put it in or if there was just some mishap in the kitchen.   When the bill came, the sangria (which we never received) was still on there. We told our server, who seemed irritated, and another 15 minutes went by before we got the updated bill. I totally get everyone has their off days, and I love Sam Fox concepts, but I don't think I'll be returning to this location any time soon.",

He also poured our alcoholic beverages at brunch (only one per person) as a much lower level then any table around us, by about half.    Food, pretty decent.  One person ordered the Margherita pizza.  good crust, right about of tomato, the mozz did NOT taste fresh whatsoever, but the weird thing, my sister asked for some Ricotta cheese to be added, and it made the dish!  Another person ordered the egg sandwich which was just okay, when it's mostly bun/roll versus inside, it's never a good thing.  And lastly I had the grilled chicken panini.  There was not a lot of chicken on this at all, but the aioli made up for the sandwich as a whole.  Is it worth going, yeah.  The atmosphere is awesome, place is stunning, food, average.",

Bartenders are always cool. Servers are decent managers are on point it's a good vibe. It's a bit overpriced but it's at the mall so that's expected. Oh the patio...perfect when the weather is nice! When I don't know what I feel like I go to Olive and Ivy I can find something.",

Would give 5 stars, but Mushroom pasta was sent back due to lack of flavor and lack of mushrooms! Would come back here again.",

My husband and I ordered pesto flatbread and lamb gyro. The flat bread was delicious and lamb gyro was okay, which we could have passed it on. This place was a recommendation and surely didn't disappoint",

The cobblestone, foliage and water feature made the patio that much more enjoyable as we sipped our cocktails in the sun and watched people bustling about at the courtyard across the way at a festival.  When our kale salad, bruschetta and sea scallops arrived, I couldn't decide where to start! A light citrus dressing and slices of granny smith apples gave the salad a nice tartness. Of the trio of bruschetta, my fave was the sauteed mushrooms served with melted swiss - savoury deliciousness! Accompanying the sweet scallops were seared asparagus and polenta drizzled in a balsamic reduction.  You can really notice the freshness and quality of the ingredients they use here. If you want to enjoy Olive but don't have the time to sit down, they have a marketplace inside the restaurant where you can pick up things like sandwiches and fresh pressed juices - something I'll keep in mind if I want a quick snack while shopping!",

    "text": "Excellent food and service for Christmas Eve dinner... minus the refrigerator effect  Our family has a tradition of visiting a nice restaurant for Christmas Eve Dinner. From the Brown Palace in Denver to the US Grant in Sand Diego to the Phoenician in Scottsdale, it's a special occasion to celebrate with relatives.  This year, we decided to stay closer to home and agreed on Olive and Ivy for the cuisine and Yelp! ratings. It was a very good fit.   Our service person, Jessica, did a fine job-- accommodating of taste preferences spanning grandparents to children, kept the timing of courses on track, and made sure drinks were never more tan 1/3 to empty.  Bruchetta Trio was worth a try even if it was unremarkable. Hot chocolates hit the spot on a cold Scottsdale evening. Mediterranean salad, kale salad, and the plate of artichoke hearts were superb-- especially the latter.  Just as excellent, the rib-eye was supremely tasty and perfectly cooked, my wife was very happy with her salmon, and my father-in-law said the shrimp risotto was worth coming back for. The cheesecake was also good, though we were all so sated and chilly that it was a forced attempt at dessert.  Speaking of chilly: One (BIG) knock is that there is a well-used door in the back room. When wait staff traversed in and out, it sent 40-degree air our way. And when an inconsiderate family was finished eating, they held the door open for a good five minutes as everyone sauntered out. A waiter finally noticed and came to have them close the door as I got up to ask them to not freeze us any longer. The result was the same: We ended up eating most of our meal with our coats on us and our food quickly lost its heat. I'm docking one star just for that poor experience and for no one noticing or making a good effort to fix things. Could just be that it's southern Arizona and they aren't used to looking for people eating with coats on, but still...  Definitely worth the visit and I suspect the chilly letdown we had was an anomaly. The food and service staff were quite good.",

I have been here many times and Olive & Ivy is always a solid choice. The ambiance is stunning (and only to get better once the patio renovation is completed), the food is delicious and the service is always top notch.    I recommend the sweet potato cannelloni and the roasted beet salad very highly.  Easy to order both and share between two people - that way you can taste a little of each and still be more than satisfied.  Now onto the wine.  If you are a white wine fan, you MUST order the Chenin Blanc.  I'm not kidding.  It's fantastic and a great value.  At $7/glass, you might think it will be terrible.  Wrong!  It's the value play on the menu.  Every restaurant has one - it's up to you to find it....and here it is.  Crisp and light.  Perfect, easy and drinkable....sounds just like the date you had on match last night, eh? ;)",

When I asked the origin of the House sparkling wine for the mimosas he could only respond that \"yeah it's good.\" Our food orders were completely incorrect, poached eggs looked inedible but were delivered to my one daughter. We asked for the manager. She was lovely and responsive. We were delivered a whole new cream fast. And we expressed our appreciation. But unfortunately my other daughters over easy eggs were swimming in a pool of grease. When the manager checked in with us again she comped the whole meal. The lows were that the meal was only ok and the service awful. But the highs were that the manager really cared about us and took care of us. We have high expectations for Olive and Ivy.

It's a great spot to meet up for happy hour or drinks before venturing off to Old Town and start your shenanigans. For my singletons, I will say it is a great starting point for first dates as you can really hit any of the other restaurants once the meet and greet awkwardness wears off (speaking from experience as the lifeline/wingman).  Unfortunately, as with most things deceptively beautiful outside, the interior make up does not always match up. I am about consistency. And both food and service are spotty. They have been phenomenal when we hosted a large birthday dinner in the large room. The bar area is fun and you'll always be able to strike up a conversation with anyone as I love the diverse crowd that hangs out there. Patio service tends to be harder to gauge. I've had fantastic and attentive servers and some not. The sangria and flatbreads are incredible such that you don't realize you might have ordered twice or more times because you want that much more. They used to have a watermelon salad that my tongue craves but has been replaced by a beet salad which isn't a bad stand in. However, I've been here on a Friday night where a friend couldn't get a Coors Light. How do you run out of beer and that beer of all things on a weekend? I also love that you can just pop into the market and grab gelato that has an array of flavor I want to bathe in.  Usually for a FCR, I am generally impressed but Olive & Ivy has struggled to maintain the bar that Sam Fox sets at his other venues such as Culinary Dropout or Arrogrant Butcher. With that said, even low on Sam's radar is pretty high in the restaurant industry.",

Inside is nicely decorated, they also have outdoor seating but a storm was coming in so we didn't sit out there. On a nice day, you would get a lovely view of the canal! It's right on the waterfront. Hubby and I got some drinks and apps. The happy hour menu is decent. The apps we got were the lamb meatballs and then their bruschetta. The on meatballs was just a tiny serving and then the bruschetta was pretty good, but honestly not the best I've had. Our server was nice, but that's about it. We had to find her or just stop another server every time we needed something. It was an okay experience, but not 5 stars. I might be back for the Sangria!",

And yet just a few short days ago I had lunch on the patio of Olive & Ivy in the sunshine with a happy little breeze blowing through the place.  So perhaps I'm attaching a little more magic to the experience than is totally merited, but when we strip away the ambiance and charm of eating outside in January I'm still left with some delicious food.  I was immediately impressed with the bread and pesto. Zing! Lots of bite to it to help you remember the taste. We ordered a couple of flatbreads for the group and scarfed them down in no time. Then again, you put asparagus on just about anything and I'd eat it.  I ordered a simple turkey sandwich and was not disappointed. I'd like to try a few other menu items as well, because I'm not sure I had the best of the best, but still it hit the spot just the same and I'd eat it again.  As mentioned, our server (DeAnne?) was on top of things--totally professional, dedicated to her job, and one hundred percent darling. You heard me. I said darling.",

I am so glad he took an interest in our comments and asked us to return. This latest visit definitely rates 5 stars. We again sat outside on the patio that overlooks the canal. It was perfect. The service was excellent and the waiter was very attentive without hovering. The food was perfect. My husband ordered the rib-eye steak and said it was cooked to perfection and very tender. I ordered two vegetarian appetizers, hummus with vegetables and the flatbread. The margherita flatbread rates among the best I have ever eaten.  I am so glad we were asked to give this establishment a second visit. The outside atmosphere and location makes it a favorite of ours to take out of town guests.",

Either that or pound cake just sucks. It might be the latter. It was super dry. We got a scoop of vanilla ice cream with it which we were all fighting over.

If I had to pick a favorite, I would go with the piccante as the best only since it had a lot of kick to it, and I don't want to go with the boring route.

The fresh bread and pesto that were brought to the table was delicious.  The bacon wrapped dates were amazing, and not a small portion  either. I had the white bean and kale minestrone and it was also very good. For dinner we had seared scallops over a sweet corn and asparagus, and bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with fingerling potatoes and swiss chard.  The scallops were cooked great and the corn and asparagus very tasty.  The pork was cooked to perfection, moist and melted in your mouth with the smokiness of the bacon just yummy.  For dessert we chose the chocolate mousse and apple crisp.  The mousse was a perfect size and not too sweet.  The apple crisp was a bit disappointing, it was extremely soupy, which our server also recognized but said there was no manager to tell.  Over all a great evening.",

I really don't mind luke warm food. It's nice cause i can just start eating with out worrying about scalding my face. (wish it was a little bit warmer though).   I got the veal raviolis and shrimp ontop (as recommend by the server).  Shrimp was overcooked... :\\, ravioli was just okay... I wasn't really blown away by it. Veal tasted dry inside...is that possible with ravioli?   I tried the rest of my parties dishes and i wasn't blown away. Maybe my expectations have become too high of the fox restaurants.  I will chalk it up to a bad night at the restaurant. I'd give them a second try because all the other fox restaurants i have been to, i've enjoyed.   But out of this experience it was a 3.  :\\",

The glasses of wine helped too! The food was pretty yummy. I would recommend the roasted mushroom bruschetta if you like balsamic.  The scallop entree was bit on the sweet side but the rib eye was pretty good.    Appetizer + 2 entrees + 2 drinks + tip = $130 Reasonable.  We will go again...

I had a wonderful glass of wine, and we shared flatbread pizza and artichokes.  So tasty!  I thought our server was a doll and she indulged us as we argued about who had the best wine, then when she found it was my birthday she brought me a wonderful birthday surprise.  The BEST every desert, some banana custard with chocolate and mocha on top. YUMMY.  Thanks for making my date night romantic, fun and warm! Hugs to O & I.",

The drinks are consistently good and they have a good wine list. They are also fairly well equipped for large groups with private rooms and large tables in the main dining room.    The food is good, but not great.  It's never bad...  it's consistently decent, but doesn't blow me away.  I recommend the scallops, but replace the corn with salad...  the corn is a strange combination and not very tasty.  The kale salad is good, but too much kale without enough other parts of the salad mixed in.  The staff and ambiance are the winning aspects to this place.",

I should have had one, too. The beer was fine, but I didn't realize it was gonna be in a bottle, so I'm sad about that. A little pricy for a bottle.   Me: This was a surprisingly noisy restaurant given that it wasn't packed on a Tuesday night. But I have sat on their patio in more clement weather, and it was delightful. Reminds me of Paris. 5 stars for the patio.   Craig: It was mostly empty when we first noticed the noise level. That being said, it's nicely decorated inside. It's a cool ambiance.   Me: Agreed. And the service was very good, very professional and prompt.   Craig: Yeah, we got our food really fast. However, it was all cold.   Me: The bruschetta was clearly intentionally cold, but I think I would have preferred it hot. Mushrooms, asparagus, etc., seem like they should be served hot.   Craig: I think my surprise favorite was the seasonal chef board, which was like a build-our-own bruschetta.   Me: Yes, it was tasty, though I preferred the mushroom bruschetta.   Craig: I'm changing my answer. That was also my favorite.   Me: But I still think I prefer the pub board and bruschetta at Postino. And this place is a little pricier.   Craig: But it is Scottsdale.   Me: True. Still, a solid four stars for me.   Craig: Easy four.",

I had seen many photos and read way too many reviews after my fair share of yelp stalking! We were able to snag a reservation for Saturday afternoon for a group of 6. The space is large and beautiful!! The menu was simple and not to overwhelming which is a huge + in my book! We all tried something different and all of it was really great (flatbread + egg sandwich + kale salad + salmon bagel + truffle fried) ! What made our experience exceptional was the service we received! Our server was incredibly funniest, personable, attentive!!! She had us laughing each time she stopped by! I ended up spilling some ketchup on my blouse and she was me trying to clean with a napkin, she quickly went and grabbed some sparking soda water to see if that would help it, when it didnt she found a tide pen!!! TRUE STORY this lady was a gift!   All in all we had a great time during brunch! I'd def return!",

My husband and I had a 5:15 pm dinner reservation  to catch up with an old friend(too early but it was Friday night) and long after dinner was done we never rushed to leave (3 hrs we chatted away). I can't remembered what we ordered, we there a month ago. I believe we ordered t-bone steak, artichoke hearts, key lime pie cheesecake and I can't remember the 2-3 other items, but nothing was disappointing.  If you can snag a spot on their patio-do it. It seems to be the place people kick off the night, we saw a few bridal shower parties, bachelorette parties, and girls night out type of groups.  Worth dinning here at least once.  This company is also associated with North Italia, which we are huge fans of.",

We had two plates of bruschetta trios, and three of the six arrived wrong; one was a completely different toast that we didn't order, the salmon Lox one had no Lox (hello...! Haha), etc. Errors aside, they were incredibly good. We agreed we could have easily just had those for our meal and been fine.   We also got two salads - Caesar and Mediterranean with chicken - and they were good.   The house bread never came, although we were told it was coming, so I can't comment on that.  Our waiter was quick and attentive, but there were plenty of mistakes in a small number of dishes.   Even still, we'd be back. We could have stayed here for hours!",

Recommendations: Bruchetta (Mushroom and Roasted Garlic- Finger Licking good, I mean it!) and Prosciutto and Fig, Molte Bene! Pesto Chicken Flatbread is packed with flavor and not too heavy. Pasta: You must get the Wild Mushroom Pappardelle- It's amazing, it has truffle, herbs and Parmesan cheese (sorry folks it has no meat, but a well done dish) highly recommend it. It's pack with flavor, and if you are a truffle fan this is a must.  I can't go back soon enough! Make a trip to Camelback Rd to check this place out!",

It took him almost 30 minuets just to bring me a soda...honestly he was kinda creepy too.  I typically don't like writing bad reviews but man this guy has no business of being a server at all.  The restaurant is cool and the food is pretty solid too. Reasonably priced too. But crappy service will turn me to go elsewhere next time.",

The service was quite good, and they have bottles of wine for almost any budget with a knowledgeable staff.   Their lamb and couscous dish was decent, though after seeing the rib-eye steak, I should have ordered that... The fish also looked quite good.   Also, get the peanut butter caramel sea salt chocolate mousse - it's good enough to eat it every day in place of a bowl of cereal, and it's just about as big! (I'd figure out how to make it at home if it didn't have so many calories...)   You could of course choose to get just the mousse and skip dinner... and I wouldn't hold it against you, though you might want to compliment it with the chocolate-chocolate-chocolate cake and an espresso when you do just so you don't pass out from the sheer weight of all the amazing calories you've eaten!   The espresso after dinner was an excellent addition to the mousse.  Stay hungry!",

Sitting indoors is nice as well since the interior is all open to the outdoors.  Lots of food and drink options available for everyone, the server let us know that everything is made from scratch in house (impressive!) I ordered the table side mimosa with the smoked salmon & bagel and it was delicious! I had already snacked a lot at the farmer's market and had to take half to go, but no regrets would 100% get this again. Whatever my friends got too looked delicious (biscuits and gravy, egg sandwich, eggs Benedict, etc.) The Bloody Mary had a kick, perfect to wake you up in the morning.  What kind of was meh to me was the fact that we looked at the next table over & they got a full glass of mimosa while our table when first poured, only got maybe half a glass. Not a huge deal, but something that I saw while dining. Besides this little thing, service was great and we were in and out quickly.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice brunch in the area!",

So a tip is to call ahead and advance to get a reservation if you likes on the patio because it's absolutely not going to happen if you are walking in on a busy night. My bad! One really interesting appetizer was the trio of bruschetta and you were able to pick which ones you wanted. They were very good and a real fun appetizer to share with my husband. I highly recommend Oil & Ivy if you really want to get a feel for modern Scottsdale culinary landscape.",

We heard a lot about Scottsdale and we looked up places to eat, Olive & Ivy was one of the first things to pop up on yelp. The 2 stars I'm giving are only for the aesthetic of the place. The seating area outside on the patio is very appealing. We sat outside around a fire place and the patio was decorated with lights. Now let me get to the part that really made me disappointed. The food was terrible. First off the price is not cheap, so therefore if I'm paying for something expensive I expect it to be good. I came with 3 other people and only one thing out of all our orders was alright. We ordered the rib eye steak which is what they promote highly, we asked for it medium well. The steak was $45 and it comes with one side which is 2 small pieces of finger potatoes and that's all. The steak came out bleeding and pretty much Raw. It was very rare and red. Second the chicken in the Mediterranean salad was burned and tasteless. The waitress only appeared a few times. She did not ask for us how our food was at all, even after seeing that it was barley touched.  Only recommend coming here strictly for drinks and a cute place to sit with friends.",

    "text": "Since my last visit to Arizona I've come to accept there are some truly exceptional restaurants in this desert state. Going to one of the wealthier areas of Arizona, Olive & Ivy is located next to a river and features a luxurious interior of velvet, wood, and spirits. From the moment you walk in you feel like this is going to be a special evening.   Interior - 5 stars Olive & Ivy has this beautiful, romantic mood at night. The lights are low and the shadows seep into the wood work. Homages to the old style of tungsten light bulbs hang from above while plush curtains drape from ceiling to floor. The style is open and wide, allowing light to come shine from the outside and having both outdoor and indoor seating connect with no walls to be a border. The kitchen is large and open letting anyone see the beauty of their art and the giant bar located near the entrance wraps around to the back where the gelato and take out area exists. Walking around just a little a bit shows Olive & Ivy is much bigger than you initially expect.  Service - 3 stars The service was good. Nothing exceptional comes to mind though the staff did seem to work as a fluid team. Good wait staff who'll probably do their best to accommodate your needs but more likely you'll get normal, friendly service.  Food - 4 stars The menu here is simple, with only about 5 categories of food and 4-6 options underneath them. This includes a section for bruschetta, salads, flatbreads, meats, and entrees. The bruschetta was excellent. They use fresh ingredients and the bread is crisp and flavorful. All the ingredients come together to compose a symphony in your mouth and though some are better than others, none are sub par. I was intrigued to try their shrimp risotto. Often times I have found risotto is usually under or overcooked so I was hoping Olive & Ivy would be the outlier; I was happy to be correct. When the risotto came out it did look like it might be overcooked but it was perfect. The rice was moist, plump, and took in the deep flavors of the stock it was boiled in. The spiciness of the Spanish chorizo was full and a great accent to the creaminess of the dish. Along with a tasty kale pesto the shrimp in the dish is plump and plentiful. They don't skimp on the meat and the bowl is a wonderful, filling meal. If they could make this dish this well every time more people would order risotto happily.  Price - 4 stars The price for the items aren't cheap. Most entrees will run around the $25-$29 range while the salads and flatbreads lean themselves to the $17 range. It'll be a bit on the expensive side but I highly recommend trying the food and it'll change your mind. You'll see food this good is worth it. Bring friends and do it as a share meal and you'll see it might even be less than you expect.  Conclusion  Olive & Ivy has a gorgeous atmosphere fitting of impressing dates and creating happiness. With a lavish interior and robust food this riverfront restaurant has all the makings of a great night out. A must try if you are in the Scottsdale area.",

After at least 45 minutes of waiting (and watching several patrons put their names on the list after us and get seated well before us) I went in and asked about how much longer until we could be seated, and was told about 15 minutes. 20 minutes later we were finally seated. I mean it was busy, but not that busy so needless to say we were a little frustrated. Now, all of that being said, dinner was amazing. I had the sea bass and my girlfriend had the ahi tuna. We thought both were outstanding. The service (once we got in) was great and our food came surprisingly quickly. I highly recommend this place, but you should definitely make a reservation.",

The food never disappoints.  MUST try their tuna tartare in \"taco\" shells.  It is DELICIOUS OMG.  They make an awesome red sangria.  Their ahi tuna steak and sea bass are DELICIOUS!  Also, I've tried their featured specials from time to time and they are always yummy.  Overall, great restaurant.  On the weekends, they have a live DJ so it really makes it a great dining experience and they have a nice open air atmosphere with tables on the terrace facing the canal.  Service is always great here.  MUST EAT HERE!!!",

However on the other side of the coin, the waitstaff is poorly trained and aggressive in telling you what you want, even after you order it your way. For example, my medium rare tuna arrived medium well because I wouldn't order it rare. There appeared to be little service training: when ordering wines by the glass, the waiter said that is what we call it even if it is wrong, when he missed one of the ladies in our party during the drink order, there was no apology just a flip comment from the waiter that clearly offended her. The staff clearly has the priority and walked thru parties while they were being seated rather than taking the 2 extra steps to walk around. It is a shame, since this a nice place with good food at a reasonable price and everyone in our party enjoyed their food but the waiter ruined it for some of us and there are so many good alternatives close by.",

    "text": "After hearing good things about this place, I finally made it here for lunch.  Unfortunately, it was after the menu change so I was expecting different choices.  Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was that there wasn't much space to sit.  There were maybe 5 small tables near the ordering counter and just as much at the patio.  This was a fast casual place(you order at the counter but they'll bring food out to you).  The menu was somewhat small.  You get to pick between pizza, salad, or sandwich.  I decided on a gyro and my bf got the corn pizza.  Since we wanted to sit inside, we decided to go past the ordering counter to see if there were any tables there.  I was skeptical since all I could see was the kitchen and waitstaff in that area, but it turned out there was a ton of restaurant seating that you can't see when you go in.  We weren't sure if we were suppose to sit there since it looked more formal, but we did anyway.  The food came within a reasonable amount of time and it was decent.  My gyro was generously portioned.  The pickle that came with my gyro could have been more crisp and the tzatziki sauce was pretty bland.  The corn pizza was also a generous portion and seemed quite good from the bite I got.  My main dislike of this place was the layout.  Seating shouldn't be hidden in the back.  The food is slightly pricey and none of the menu items jumped out at me.  I'd describe this place as underwhelming.  At least this place has underground parking.",

Olive & Ivy is beautiful and near some water, entertaining and lesbian friendly and full of people who've had plastic surgery. Great space. Fabulous patio. I know. I know. The canal. Ugh. Love it? Hate it? Hey, it's there people. Embrace it! Like the Brady's did cousin Oliver.  And embrace the Eggs Benedict, Egg Sandwich, Focacciao bread with pesto and CENTER CUT CINNAMON ROLLS! You heard me people! Center cut. No non glazed, hardened, corner piece. Service was outstanding. I noticed the patio filled up just after we arrived. Isn't that weird? Does that ever happen to you? You arrive somewhere. Nothing. Soon the place is buzzing and so are you? Anyway. I digress. We were thirsty fashionistas recovering after a night at Scottsdale Fashion Week...i.e. we were pickled and thirsty. Ice tea and water was a flowin' the entire meal. They saw it in our blood shot eyes I'm sure. Eggs Benedict was perfection and had a delightful surprise of basil on top! Rickie LOVED his egg sandwich with avocado...looked great...though he never offered me any...Hmmm..Olive & Ivy. Like Ebony & Ivory. Living together in perfect harmony. Side by side....ok ok ok you get the picture.",

There are no upscale Mediterranean/tapas style restaurants in Scottsdale, so I was really excited to try Olive and Ivy.  The space is beautiful.  I do not even want to fathom how much money went into this place.  The dining room is a little on the large side for my taste, but it still maintains a dark intimate ambiance despite its size.  Now onto the disappointments - the food is all quite good.  Very high quality ingredients.  But....  it still managed to bore me.  I was looking forward to strong cheeses, spice, pungent flavors, a culinary adventure, a good mystery.  No adventure here.  It was more Disneyland than Greece or Portugal or whatever they attempted to reference.  And the service was deplorable. Truly bad.  I know the restaurant is still new, but I am not willing to cut it much slack considering the prices.  Haven't they heard of training?  I won't be rushing back.  My advice to Olive & Ivy?  Have a little more confidence in the people.  Be a leader.  Push the culinary boundaries of Scottsdale's palate.  We need some vision.",

Considered a table but thought we were better off at the bar, since we weren't sure if our party would grow as the afternoon, evening and night wore on.  That was smart of us, since the group did grow substantially in number.  Drinks were pricey, but for the venue it was to be expected.  Atmosphere was fun, we did what we wanted, the hostess staff was absolutely adorable and sweet.  Around 5 they started charging cover ($25 a head!), so one of our friends (whose wife had been with us all afternoon) would have had to pay the cover to get in, but luckily I was able to (drunkenly, I might add) persuasively slur my magic to build a valid case, and my friend got in without having to pay.  We had a great time and had front row seats to the 50cent party entering the 944 village right across the way.",

Turns out their white napkins are \"linty\" and they have had people complain, so they give out black napkins to anyone with dark pants on. Why anyone would complain to a restaurant  about lint on their trousers is an entirely different question. This place has great ambiance too. Check it out!",

The description said it had shaved ham and basil hollandaise sauce. The waitress made a point of telling me that the \"over easy\" eggs would be very runny. Ok...Well I thought it was odd that they weren't poached, but went with it since I know Benedict includes a runny egg--It is part of what makes then delicious. I was also eager to try the bread since they made a point of mentioning that all their bread was baked in house. Boy, was I in for a big disappointment!  The Benedict arrived. It was two Thomas' English muffins with deli meat ham and the basil hollandaise was just sauce garnished with basil. The eggs were not runny--they were raw. I mean the egg whites were raw!  The waitress seemed startled when I sent it back, but was truly great about it. But...I think you can guess what happened next...It came back with over-cooked eggs...think hard boiled! At this point, I was starving, so I just went with it. The waitress noticed that I wasn't eating much so she didn't charge me.  So...I give them 5 stars for service, but 1 star for food.  I will say that it is a nice setting and I would go back for a drink, but not much more.  Thank you to the stellar wait staff for somewhat redeeming the experience!  That being said, I was just visiting the area so I won't likely be back.",

Service has always been top notch and the food is consistently good. Did I say they have good flatbreads? They're awesome. Large portions, so don't order too much or you'll be going home with lots of leftovers.  Hummus is good, and oh I forgot to mention the baked items. Fresh breads and the cinnamon rolls are TO DIE FOR. Get there early and get them warmed up. The rolls go pretty fast so don't be surprised if they sell out.  This place is a little hard to find, but definitely worth looking for.",

They brought out some AWESOME Bread with an incredible Pesto Sauce, Yummy!  I ordered the beet salad with arugula, goat cheese & pistachio.  I was NOT disappointed, highly recommend!  This was my dinner, I think I had to much popcorn at the movie before. :)  Between the salad and bread I was satisfied and not to full for desert!  We shared a desert, Apple Tart, Very Good!  My mother had the Mediterranean Salad and a Friend had the Lasagna and both said their dishes were good.  Service:  Our server was very attentive!  The only reason I did not give Olive and Ivy 5 Stars was because it was too noisy in the restaurant.  I have noticed more and more restaurants are going for the cement floors that lend to a nosier atmosphere.",

The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated with a classy feel.  It's a varied clientele: I noticed tables that could've been from the Golden Girls to Real Housewives of Scottdale to Teen Mom, AZ.  I thought the food, while good, was not anything spectacular. Portions were pretty small for the price and there was not much by way of presentation to match the tag.  My sangria seemed a bit diluted.  Our waiter was being trained so I'll pardon his awkwardness as he tried to repeat everything he was supposed to memorize multiple times. I'd come back on a cool day to try HH out on the patio to people watch, but probably not for brunch.",

Pesto was perfection.  We then shared the Mediterranean Salad and Chicken Pannini.  Salad was very, very good.  The Pannini was literally one of the best sandwiches I have wolfed down in a very long time.  Moist, simple, filling.  Unreal.   We found the service to be very solid.

The Pomegranate Martini is very tasty, and surprisingly not very sweet.   Once we got sat, everything at the table was spectacular starting with the hummus, then the sweet potato cannelloni and finishing with the coffee creme brulee.   I couldn't ask for a better meal.  The table agreed that the sweet potato was one of the best things they have ever eaten, it's a must!  I was in vegetarian heaven.

We liked the loud music, the atmosphere, and the energy of the place.  The location by the canal is so cool with the little bridge and all of the lights.  We split a butter lettuce salad (with avocado, bacon and perfectly ripe tomatoes)- it was delicious!  My husband had the scallops and I had the sweet potato cannelloni.  Both were fabulous and SO GOOD!  We had the peanut butter ice cream bar for dessert- the chocolate pretzel crust was very yummy.  Our service was absolutely perfect- Martin was very friendly, very helpful, and his visits to our table were perfectly timed.  We will definitely be back.",

Do not get me wrong, their menu is great BUT it is not anything like any of his other concepts ((Fox) in my opinion) since it seems a lil too simple and small....you can great an amazing meal (their scallops are awesome) here just for me it has been for the great patio, restaurant, bar ambiance for a few apps and drinks before heading out or somewhere for a quick drop in.  Great people watching and a great view of what the Waterfront architects were trying to create. Service is always just OK but this place always is busy so I guess that is to be sometimes expected.",

After eating at Modern Steak and Sauce, we decided to come here and grab a bite. Fox group is three for three in our book! I had their egg sandwich with avocado, bacon and cheese and that was amazing! Those potatoes that it came with were so yummy too! It was deceiving, I wasn't sure if it was going to keep me full, but I was stuffed after eating it! Their muffins were yummy and my dog loved the treats I brought him home :) The outdoor patio was so beautiful and the dining room looked amazing. We will definitely try dinner when we come back to Arizona!",

We made a reservation earlier in the day but when arriving to the restaurant realized that we wanted to set outside (the back patio is very cute and quieter). The bar scene is pretty good and I really enjoyed the red sangria. We ordered a bunch of items to share and everything was delicious. I recommend the roasted veggie crostini, the arugula salad, and the sweet corn and margarita flat breads. I'd give the restaurant 4.5 stars - the service was fast but our server sounded like he was reading off of a script in his head and didn't really understand the food or wine menus.",

The atmosphere was lovely, very visually satisfying, me and my girlfriends sat on the patio with the surrounding of the Scottsdale canal, flowers and plenty of shade. I requested we ask the server, Valentino (sooo handsome) to assist us with a few items to share amongst us. We ordered the chopped salad, French toast, chicken pesto flat bread, Salmon bagel and bacon x 5 plates. We also drank mimosas,that were kept full, with decent champagne and the perfect OJ ratio. The food was average in taste and approach for common dishes, I would suggest more personality to it but it was enjoyable and satisfying none the less. Priced appropriately.   Valentino, our server, was very attentive, very knowledgable and had over all provide exceptional service to \"4 Hangry females from Scottsdale and a birthday girl.\" He kept the table nice and clean, was very informative of the menu and concept and the thoughtful service was more then appreciated. Wonderful service!!!   Over all I rate this as a deserving 4 stars, because it was exactly what I expect from the name and location of this establishment. I will recommend for a lovely brunch spot and look forward to my return.",

I loved the dark chocolate gelato and the coconut- the espresso was just ok and didn't have the best texture.  The peanut butter pudding was tasty but very rich and heavy.

    "text": "Been here many times due to location and great patio.  First the good: Location, location, location. Right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale by Fashion Square and the Canal. The restaurant looks the part, has an amazing patio covered by massive shade trees alongside the canal. There are cleverly hidden scent sprayers in the event the canal or the many birds in the neighborhood emanate a less desirable scent.   Service is fairly good. Young, good looking people are cast to fulfill the part of waiters and most play their part well. Our waitress for lunch yesterday was super, the one we had a few weeks go would have rather been elsewhere and we left early.   Now the mediocre: I would call it the food. If you have been to one Fox Restaurant Concept eatery you've been to all. In a sense it brings a certain level of comfort knowing that you'll have similar food in the different restaurants of the company; I wish however that each restaurant did a better job differentiating itself by offering more varied food choices.  And last but not least, the bad: The restaurant, and all of the company's restaurants really, are build for turning tables in their dining rooms. It is virtually impossible to have a conversation because it is so loud inside. The patio is more forgiving.   Basically, Olive and Ivy looks the part, has decent service with run of the mill food. If you want to see an be seen in this neighborhood its the place to be.",

    "text": "We stopped in for lunch and I have to say...seriously impressed!  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table but I'm glad the wait didn't deter us from eating here. We just took a short stroll along the water area and by the time we came back, our table was ready.   I LOVED the ambiance of this restaurant.  Very rustic decor, open kitchen, large dining and bar area and near the entrance; a section with bench seating with low coffee tables where patrons seemed to be enjoying cocktails and appetizers. I later discovered this was part of the bar. Very chic.  Even with high ceilings and openness of this restaurant, it was still very welcoming.  We were seated near the entrance to the outdoor patio so while we didn't sit outdoors, we felt like we were dining el fresco. This time of the year in Scottsdale is wonderful so we could not be any happier with where we were seated.   I ordered a Bloody Mary extra spicy and a margherita pizza (err flatbread) for lunch. The cocktail was made PERFECTLY and had a nice little kick to it...just how I like it.  The margherita pizza was absolutely delicious as well. The crust was thin, light and had great flavor and the toppings just made it that much more irresistible.  I didn't think I would be able to finish the entire pizza but I somehow did. I just could not stop myself, it was that tasty.  After complimenting our waitress (which I forgot her name (sorry!) on how great the service and food was, we discovered this is owned by the same company that manages True Food Kitchen, one of our favorite restaurants. We would come back here in a heartbeat....but since this is in Scottsdale and not in San Diego, it will be tough to get back here when we're craving you. So, can you please open an Olive & Ivy out here?",

    "text": "There's nothing better than escaping sub-zero temperatures for the toasty climes of Phoenix. I was lucky enough to do this last week (pre-Snowpacolypse), and there was no better way to enjoy the sun than sitting by the fountain on the patio at Olive and Ivy.  At first glance, I thought this spot was going to be a bit stuffy since it's located in a pseudo strip mall area. However, the second I stepped inside my opinion changed. It can only be described as lofty, with eye-catching light fixtures and decor. Although I didn't notice it until my way out, I am totally enamored with the white room just off the front door - it features a large round table for 12 (I think) with high-backed chairs, ethereal curtains and a to-die-for white glass chandelier. Very intimate and would be fun for a brunch party, methinks.  Don't pass up the bread and pesto here, my friends. It will put a smile on your face, as will the mushroom and asparagus truffle pizza. We tried several flatbreads, but that was definitely the standout. I enjoyed a few sips of the house sangria and am a fan of the sugared rim, and quite enjoyed my chicken curry salad, too. Just an observation - it seems like their salads are heavy on the dressing, so if you're picky about that, order yours on the side.   Stellar service here (our server was a life coach and I just wanted to hug her), and their bathroom is going on my Arizona top 10 list. Think oversized doors, floor to ceiling mirrors, and a trough-style sink. On second thought, can I hire their decorator to re-do my apartment??  As you can see, I'm a fan. It looks like they also have a little market area complete with a gelato counter in case you want to get your foodies to go. Thumbs up!",

I am a sangria snob and to date this is hands down the best sangria I have ever had! the waitress was attentive without hovering over us the whole time.

My favorite meal was the kale salad with caramelized pecans, bleu cheese, chopped bacon, mixed with a zesty orange/balsamic vinaigrette dressing --I added chicken the first night and ahi tuna the second night. Its a MUST have. The cannelloni with mushrooms were tasty, a bit too heavy and creamy on the sauce and the bruschettas (on the appetizer menu) were also on the top list.  The wait staff are super friendly, I couldn't forget to mention the female manager that helped us out immensely as we were in dire need of charging our iphone, she was professional and so accommodating. Thank you so very much.   I work in the service industry and appreciate a nice meal with good service and this was by far my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. We will definitely come back.",

    "text": "This rating is based on first experience on a Saturday around 8:30 pm. We did not have a reservation. There were four of us in our party. They use the OpenTable system. If you're planning on a weekend night, I suggest you use it. This was a very busy night.  We're not taking into account the 50 minute wait for a table. That was completely our bad for not making reservations (it was a last minute thing) and our desire to sit outside (even longer wait) as it was very loud and crowded (this seems to be another regular occurrence with Fox restaurants: they don't architect enough sound dampening to handle their capacity and they encourage standing room only at the bar with very loud/upbeat music (there was a DJ). I believe this is within their control, but they merely wish it this way.  Fox Restaurant concepts has a knack for creating restaurants with a 'hip' atmosphere and a certain kind of clientele in mind. This was my first time here but my fifth Fox Restaurant visit. I'm starting to notice the ingredients/entrees are 'shared' across Fox menus. This can be a good thing as mainly these items are fresh and of high quality.  We ordered 3 rounds of drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts. We kept a lively mood as we were good friends who hadn't seen each other in a while. Three of us had previous restaurant experience.  Sam Fox stresses \"outstanding hospitality every time\". There are little things good and bad not worth noting. They're just what you'd expect on a busy Friday night at a popular place. That being said it would have been 'outstanding' if that kind of thing you expect everywhere else didn't apply here.  Overall the food was very good (the sweet potato canneloni was noteworthy as well as mushroom soup du jour). However the service and pacing are what killed the experience for all of us.    When disappointment was expressed in an item he was not apologetic, in fact he was downright combative: \"Oh, I know I said there would be 10 meatballs, but these were the last ones for the night. (there were six small ones). There was no offer to replace them with something else.  \"It's a Sicilian tirimasu I TOLD you it would have citrus flavors (there were overriding orange flavors). Again, no offer to replace the item. Then of course the strange insistence he had on setting items directly in front of someone who was speaking, obscuring their view of others (a simple wait of 30 seconds would not have been disruptive), but the lack of urgency to clear the table end of meal when he was nowhere to be found and empty dessert plate sat until even after the bill was taken.  How can I write this in such detail? Because while we all tried to converse, catch up and ignore his faux pas it became harder and harder to do so until we burst out in nervous laughter. We ended up poking fun at his strange actions to keep things light. As I mentioned we'd all worked as servers so we just shrugged it off, gave him his 20% and chalked it up to a poor luck of the draw. We didn't complain to the manager or give him a hard time because he's just trying to make a living (and we didn't want the night to end on THAT note), we just all shook our heads and pondered if he knew why he probably wasn't do so well as a waiter.  I know Fox concepts wants a guest to have a great time, come back and recommend their places, but it also takes friendly service. Hospitality as Sam Fox defines it.  Even if there were a bunch of mistakes, friendliness, humility and a desire to please would have gone a long way with this group. He would do well to have more training, better quality control (why would an item go out less than promised/) and to retain employees of greater dedication and character.  We'll probably come back, but if we see this guy again, we'll definitely request someone else.",

My boyfriend owns restaurants in California and it takes excellent flavors, textures and quality of food to make him happy.

It has such a beautiful patio with nice trees, comfortable seating, firepits and heaters for the chilly nights, all while overlooking the Scottsdale Waterfront. Wonderful to enjoy a glass of wine or a great meal. My favorite entree is the Tuna! Excited to go back soon!",

They have a huge patio which is very nice this time of year. I give it three stars because it's in a super busy area, parking is hard to find, not many menu options and they're pricey at that, always busy, hard to get a seat at the bar, bartenders are slammed and aren't as attentive even though you're sitting right there. You need a reservation at this place, period. I feel the staff is a bit \"stuffy\" but the tziki meatballs are great! Worth checking out but I came here for my boyfriends birthday during happy hour for a quick little bite/drink but still waited a bit. I remember why I don't come here often. Again, come to say you've tried it but not worth the hype.",

This place surprised me and delivered more than I expected.  Let's start with the food. My family and I decided to get a few small plates instead of ordering entrees.  We ordered the Fritto Misto, Lamb Meatballs, Seasonal Chef's Board and a half order of the Chicken Chopped Salad.  All were wonderful!  If I had to pick my favorite, I'd have to go with the salad.  One of the best salads I've ever had!  Who knew granola in a salad would work so well?  Our waiter was so personable and friendly.  I wish I could remember his name.  He gave good recommendations, checked on us frequently and was super attentive.  Great service goes a long way!  I will definitely be back soon.  Can't wait to try some more items off their menu!",

I visited the restaurant during happy hour and was able to get a seat at the bar with no trouble at all. The servers are extremely friendly and the food was really good.   Their complimentary pesto and bread was so good and the pesto had so much flavor. I tried the salmon lox bruschetta which was recommended and I'm so glad I did, it was so tasty and just the perfect amount. I also tried their Margherita flatbread which was so simple yet so perfect.

In regards to the food, our group had a variety of dishes and every single person felt they had the best dish! My Natural Chicken on a bed of Yukon puree with Crimini mushrooms and citrus jus was to die for. Their ability to elevate such a humble dish speaks volumes. Their drinks were also top notch, specifically the Blood Orange Paloma.   That being said, because O&I has nailed their food and drink, reservations (at least for dinner) are a must, we had to take a 5:30 rez. I'm not sure how their system works, but based on what we saw, we could have gotten something a bit later...   However, based on the food, I will definitely be back!",

This has a great patio by the river which makes it nice in the winter months.  When sitting on the patio, I would watch your drink as there tends to be leaves that fall down onto the tables.    The inside is also very nice and has nice atmosphere with high ceilings.  There are a lot of options on the menu which can range from lower cost (a simple gyro) to very high end (steak and sea bass).  Our last visit, we sat inside due to it being too hot outside, and enjoyed a nice meal.  The waiter recommended the bacon and dates which were good but not great.  The sea bass was very tasty and well worth the premium price.    The prices are a bit high but I think this place is worth it for going out every once in a while.",

They are a larger place catering to an affluent crowd and serve what they described as California Mediterranean cuisine.  The lunch menu featured sandwiches, flat breads, salads and bruschettas and almost every table seemed to be enjoying a glass of wine with lunch.  The dress code seemed a bit fancy and I did feel a bit under dressed in my jeans but it didn't seem to affect our service.  We opted for the chicken chopped salad and got the half size at the recommendation of our fine server, which was still plenty big for lunch.  We also shared a cup (really a small bowl) of the daily soup special, beer cheese-thin but good.  Fresh focaccia and pesto also come with your meal and, we decided to join the crowd and have some wine too.  Service was attentive with water glasses kept full and the salads arrived without delay.  This place seems well run.  Hopefully on a future visit it would be warm enough to sit outside on their large shady patio.  Recommended",

    "text": "YUM! This place not only has cute decor, but also great food and friendly, helpful service.  I sat at the bar since I came here alone while I'm visiting town for work. I had seen such great reviews which led me to come here as my first dining experience in the city.  The bartender was very friendly and attentive (I didn't catch his name but he had a man bun so shout out to him for management, he was great!). I started with the grapefruit mojito which both looked and tasted great.  Next I ordered a bruschetta trio: - Manchego quince & Spanish chorizo - Avocado, sweet corn, charred scallion & feta - Brussels sprout, whipped goat cheese, prosciutto & sherry gastrique   They were all delicious but my favorites were the Brussels and manchego ones. I also liked that they were pretty sizable but each piece was also cut into 3 smaller bites to make it a bit easier to eat (although still messy!).  I also ordered the lamb meatballs and omg - flavor heaven!! I typically never eat lamb but these had such amazing flavor and has an in-house made tzatziki sauce which was just *muah* The bartender who served me described these best as a type of deconstructed gyro - they come with grilled, slices pita slices as well. Again, sizable portion as well.  This place was great and I do not have enough good things to say - glad I stopped here on my trip!",

I can't believe it's $39 for that meal with the creamed spinach and potatoes. It is a big, high quality steak for that price. I had the veal and spinach ravioli and the handmade pasta was just delicious. I asked for extra bread to dip in the sauce and my plate was pretty much clean. We had the pistachio tart for dessert which was really unique and tasty. We sat at the bar facing the kitchen, and it was really fun watching all the delicious food come out. We'll definitely be back, loved this place!",

We ordered some drinks and an appetizer of Bacon Wrapped dates. Highly recommend the Pomegranate Daquiri and the Evangelista. We also ordered a bruschetta board with Manchego, Mishroom and Salmon Lox. The flavor combinations were unique (manchego and quince is quite tasty). We ordered the Atlantic salmon and the Sea scallops. I definitely loved the bread that came out along with the pesto. The bread was soft and chewy and the pesto had a good subtle tang. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the creamed corn and bacon combination you would think would be a heavy addition but I enjoyed every bite and was comfortably satisfied with the portion. The dessert is definitely the best with the Peanut butter mousse with chocolate crust (high recommendation). It's light and airy and the saltiness of peanut butter complemented the chocolate crust. Our waitress (Yvonne I believe was her name) was very attentive and gave great recommendations! I would highly recommend this restaurant :)",

    "text": "As a general rule I try to avoid Olive & Ivy on weekend nights, not that the ambiance isn't great or there is a food or service problem it's just BUSY! If you don't have reservations popping in for a cocktail during peak times in the bar can be challenging, on the one hand you get to get a good look at \"The Real Housewives\" of Scottsdale in their natural habitat and many variations there of.  So I went with two friends and I was so happy we got a small comfortable cocktail table next to the bar which can be like hitting the lottery on a busy night. Service is always good I feel even on a busy night my water was always replaced. Cocktails always good they can take a while but you will understand looking at the packed bar so you have to give them a break. In previous visits I usually get the Chefs seasonal board, Italian meats and fresh cheeses and roasted vegetables this visit we got the Hummus it was fine I mean Hummus is hummus. Two flat breads the braised short rib with Gorgonzola and arugula, I'm the only human I think that does not like short rib, I've had it before in other establishments but it's not my go to. My choice was the pesto chicken with pine nuts and I asked if we could leave the caramelized onions off half of it since I was in a picky mood and do not like onions, they were so nice about it and despite the busy kitchen it came out perfect. Service + food + ambiance +",

The building is beautiful inside, offers both quick take out as well as seating if you're looking to linger. Not to be forgotten is the outdoor seating waterside that offers a view of the canal and a gentle breeze on this nice fall day.   We were on vacation, so we started with dessert - a lemon cake that was delicious. They also started us with a plate of focaccia and pesto. The pesto was fragrant and well-seasoned.   I opted for the kale salad with chicken. It was complemented by blue cheese and candied pecans. It is sure to satisfy any kale lover's  hankering.  My husband ordered the breakfast burrito which if consumed entirely will require an obligatory 30min to 1 hr prior to activity. It is filling, and has just the right amount of bacon, cheese, and potatoes. The home fries served alongside were crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside.   Service was excellent, and this place is very reasonably priced. Make sure to stop in for brunch soon.",

It was packed and we didn't have reservation so waited at the bar and enjoyed few cocktails for 30 minutes and then our table was ready.   Located on the 'river' aka waterfront near Scottsdale Fashion SC, Olive & Ivy combines a lively, animated atmosphere and retro and trendy look with comfort of old, nostalgic Arizona dinning.   Fresh Creative food, Great Service and there are multiple Seating Areas; One can seat themselves inside the restaurant in booth, tables or at the bar or outside seating is available as well.   My dinner was fantastic...I ordered the Sea bass with caramelized cauliflower, snap peas & preserved grapefruit. DELICIOUS....My mouth is watering just thinking about it... lol   If you haven't been here, put it on your list and enjoy every bite and minute of your visit.",

The manager was very nice and gracious and apologetic about us finding this in our salad but that does not make up for the fact that I might get sick tonight and that I had a piece of who-knows-what in my mouth. I will never come to this establishment again. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!",

To put it simply you are paying for decore and location, the quality ingredients do not match the prices.  We had a Veggie Fritatta $11 and the watermelon salad $10.  While it was nice that they were able to do split plates, the Mellon on the salad was not very sweet, the mint was tasteless and the chevre cream was not viscus enough to stick to the fruit.   The veggie fritata was decent, the mushrooms were a bit rubbery but the arugula and chevre were a nice touch, but was it worth $11, not really.   I did enjoy the focaccia bread and pesto that came with the meal, but that was  the high point.   The patio looked great, but with the heat and a broken misting system that was a no go.",

I really enjoyed visiting the restaurants bathroom. The bathroom was beautifully decorated with large floor to ceiling doors and externally comfortable. The service was fantastic.

We asked to be moved to another table and it was still cold. My husband had a sweater over a shirt and I had a thick cardigan. But we were determined to have a nice dinner. It was my birthday and our first time here. We ordered the sangria and artichoke appetizer. Which is a salad and very good. Artichoke hearts and baby field greens, light balsamic dressing. We thought it was a little strange we had to tell the waiter we were ready to order at this point. We were left a time waiting for our food.  Also the music was blaring to the point I wished I was sitting on the patio. Which had heaters at every table. I ordered half a beet salad, delicious. And the Bass with caramelized cauliflower. Also very good. My husband had lasagna and he said it was delicious. I would like to come back and eat on the beautiful patio next time. But my husband pretty much has crossed this restaurant off his list. We both agreed their food was delicious.",

The bread was all made fresh so the cheese just melted all over it. The staff is so sweet and friendly. The first time one of my girlfriend's and I went there we were so impressed at how sweet ( and cute ) all the waiters were... ;)  The next day we went there at 7am for breakfast and yet again the breakfast was to die for. We both had an egg and avocado kinda sandwich.  For lunch you have to try the simple green salad. I believe it was only $5 or so and it was SO BIG!   But for sure when you go you have to have to have to get the vanilla latte.. I have no idea why it is but its the best I've ever had!   Last but not least.. the atmosphere is so beautiful. The patio is amazing( fountain and trees and birds), and the inside seating is so cozy.   I feel like Im at a french cafe for breakfast but at lunch/diner I feel like I'm in Italy eating the best flatbread ever.  Must try for sure especially if you live in Scottsdale Waterfront.. just right across the street! :)",

They also give you complimentary focaccia & pesto -- so good! My personal favorite brunch items are the Mediterranean salad w/ chicken ; the Gyro ; and the breakfast sandwich.   Side note: I only come here for brunch because once I came for dinner & was pretty disappointed.. got the sea bass (~$25) & it was not very good. instead of a whole piece of fish it was like little spears of it with very little flavor :/ if I did come for dinner again I would probably stick with a salad or flatbread.",

The White Sangria tastes like white gummy bears so I was pumped about that.  The Flatbreads are $9 (during Happy Hour) which in my opinion is a little steep considering they aren't that big or that great. Even if I were starving and desperate, I'd still be a bit disappointed.   Here's the thing, this place like most Fox Restaurants is about the decor, ambiance and providing a \"cool \"experience. Never have I ever been to a Fox Restaurant and tasted food that made me want to go back.   It's a \"cool\" place to hang out, they also have a fun patio area but, I wouldn't recommend it for its culinary wonders or value for money.",

The restaurant has a good vibe; great modern decor. The wait staff and hosts/hostesses are incredibly attentive. Bonus: they are crazy good looking too. The last time I ate here, I was with 4 other girls. One of my friends broke her sandal and I asked the host if we could have some tape. Bonus points to him for giving us Velcro. We had an Open Table rezzie so we were seated right away in the dining room. I will have to ask to sit outside next time when it cools down...  We ordered much needed wine and cocktails and started off with the bruschetta. It was super tasty, seasoned perfectly and was great to share with the girls. The girls ordered shrimp and grits and salads and other dishes I can't remember off the top of my head but I went with the scallops. Moral of the story: great, fresh food and at a decent price. I didn't have room for dessert but we ordered gelato for the table. The waiter messed up on the number of scoops but that was the only thing that went wrong. Everyone cleaned their plates and was swooning over their meals. I think on the weekends they have a DJ right in the entrance, the music was actually pretty good but not sure if it fits with the crowd. There were very few people/tables who were our age (mid 20's) If you're in OT, check this place out.",

We came in the wrong door (the entrance for the attached marketplace) and tried to follow the signs to the hostess, but the signs ended before we found her.  An understanding server, who has probably seen this happen a lot, found us and pointed us in the right direction.  I ordered the tuna salad sandwich, and it was delicious.  Crispy warm toast, creamy tuna salad, fresh greens and a side of fries made for a lunch I wish I could replicate at home.  Our server expertly handled the special requests for our table, which pleased those who were avoiding gluten, dairy, or both.  My only complaint about the visit was that the music was a bit loud for the middle of the day.  Other patrons were raising their voices to be heard above it, creating even more noise.  It was nearly impossible to have a conversation with anyone not sitting directly next to, or across from me.  I can't help but notice restrooms in restaurants.  The ladies room here is very nice, with cute little touches that I was taking note of for my own home!  It was clean and well decorated, which is always a good sign, if you ask me.    I'd love to return for brunch or dinner and sample more of the menu.  For lunch, it definitely hit the spot.",

The dressing was tasty, they provided an good amount of beets, and I appreciated the pistacchios for the textural contrast.  The beet salad was almost as good as the one at the Arrogant Butcher.  We also partook in the lamb meatballs which were yummy as well.    For the entree, I chose the scallops at the recommendation of my server,  The scallops were of good size and seared on one side, but I would appreciated it more if they were seared on both sides, however.  The scallops were accompanied with scallops and sweet corn polenta which went well with the protein.  I ended the night with the chocolate mousse with cherries which was absolutely divine.  My server was friendly and attentive and it was a great overall experience.",

It was, but I really steeped in it my fiance this weekend for brunch, and it isn't that our meals were just perfect, it's that the service was very friendly and attentive, as well.   My fiance ordered the Eggs Benedict with breakfast potatoes, and I had the Bacon Cheeseburger with a side salad. He cleaned his plate, and ate whatever he could of the half burger I couldn't finish. His only comment was that he preferred the hollandaise a different way, but that's because we make it ourselves at home.   The Bacon Cheeseburger was amazing, I order it medium. If I could have finished the entire thing I would, and the red wine vinaigrette on the side of greens is the best I've had in a while. I'd love to be able to make that one at home!  We ended the meal with the strawberry shortcake dessert that was interesting...not what either of us was expecting, then again, not sure what we were expecting. It was good. I'm sure there are better choices.   Our waiter really made sure we were comfortable, enjoying our brunch and our experience. We walked out of there smiling, stopping by the marketplace to order the large Cactus Blossom iced tea on the way out.",

We ordered three different types of bruschetta and a duck tortelli plate. I am not too sure how this restaurant has almost five stars as this restaurant served the worst tasting mediterranean food I have ever tasted before. Olive and Ivy is a sad excuse for a high end restaurant with inexperienced chefs that do not even know how to cook food the right way.  Apart from the food horrible tasting food, the restaurant staff was very nice and friendly. If you are looking for good mediterranean food, save your money and go to Pita Jungle. Try to avoid restaurants owned or managed by Fox Restaurant Concepts. This is the second restaurant that I had been to managed by Fox Restaurant Concepts leaving me unsatisfied and with an upset stomach the day after. It seems that management tries to cut costs by hiring young inexperienced chefs serving low quality food.",

    "text": "No complaints about Olive & Ivy!  Free underground parking.  It looked like they have items to purchase for takeout in addition to the restaurant and bar.  There was a bit of a wait to be seated for Sunday brunch, but they have pagers and we were able to wait at the bar.  Waiting is always better when there are cocktails involved!  When we were seated, we got bread made in house & served with amazing fresh pesto. You must try it.  (see pic:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=_G2ZOQRe-pVGpNNKajnqCw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKz...</a>)  White sangria was yummy, but didn't have any fresh fruit & was served in a low ball glass (see pic:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=Zwif3G0eX8d5LHGae_HA9w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKz...</a>). Bellini was very good and very strong!  I had a good buzz after 2 drinks.  Eggs Benedict was very good with fresh shaved ham & a little fresh basil in the hollandaise. I would've liked a bit more hollandaise (see pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=RybLwKuSPLit5o2PPxy1aw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKz...</a>).  My man's Breakfast sandwich was very good. The home fries were perfectly crispy in the outside & soft on the inside. (see pic:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=YveKHBF94smnOuN-utOxOg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKz...</a>)  Patio seating with waterfront view is quaint and has a European feeling with the umbrellas, stone fountains & geraniums in the tree planter boxes. All in all... A wonderful brunch experience. I would DEFINITELY come back the next time I'm in Scottsdale.",

The next time we come in we will definitely be looking forward in sitting in her section again. The food was amazing!! We got the jalapeno cilantro hummus as an appetizer (yum!) and as an entree we got the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin cooked to perfection! The dish was beautiful and they even split it for us! We also split the chicken pesto pizza. The chicken is shredded inside the pesto and even came with pine nuts! It was amazing! Before they entree they give you complimentary bread and pesto with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Oh, and get the Strawberry & Thyme cocktail; you'll be hooked!",

I really enjoyed going there, a little over priced but good food and a great atmosphere.   This last time I was at Sunday brunch with my girls and it sucked!!!  Sangria in a carafe $20!!!!  Granted the white sangria is pretty amazing. ..but geesh!  It doesn't even look pretty!  No pretty fruit floating around or anything.   What really brings my review down was the gyro.  It sucked.  Wilted lettuce, a tomato that looked like it had been sliced last week and cold fries.  I get that they were trying to time it out right after our appetizer but letting it die in the window? ... that is just bad service.  And at $12 it should have have been perfect.  Soooo...I will be trying some new places and staying away from here.",

There is a bit of salt on the crust part of the bread so make sure you leave some fleshy bit to eat with it or it will be too salty.    For entrees we chose lasagna and pepperoni and sausage flatbread.  The lasagna is a bit too sweet for my taste and the sauce may have been too salty.  The garlic bread that comes with it was a little overladen with oil/butter.  It isn't the worst I've ever had, but nothing really to write home about.  The meat actually kind of reminded me of Chef Boyardi...  The pizza was solid.  The crust is very thin.  Nothing too special there.  Dessert was coconut cakes with blood orange gelato and the cheesecake.  The coconut cakes were 2 pieces of dense bits with a scoop of gelato in between.  It was pretty good though I wonder if vanilla ice cream would have been a better choice.  They also had a smear of something that was neither attractive nor additive in any way that I noticed.  The gelato was nice anyway with good flavor.  The cheesecake tasted not so much cakey but just like a very mild cheese.  I've never been a fan of graham cracker crustless cheesecake either.    So I imagine we'll come back here and there, but there's really nothing that will make me crave this place.  The food is solidly decent, but nothing overwhelmingly great that we've tried.  The decor is beautiful though.  Pricing is about average though some of the portions may be slightly on the small side.",

We sat in their beautiful private room, and it almost felt like we were at someone's house in their dining room.  Joel was our waiter and took fantastic care of our group.  As usual the food was delicious!  Last night I had the scallop entree (with bacon, salsify & yellow corn puree) and a side of spinach.  Jared had the salmon (with roasted beets, fingerling potatoes & horseradish vinaigrette).  We were pleased with both, as well as the bread and pesto, antipasti plate, and hummus starters.  I enjoyed a glass of Gewurztraminer while a variety of libations went down easy around the table as well including mojitos and beer.    After dinner, we moved the party outside and thankfully, the misters on the patio made this crazy AZ heat bearable!  The evening flew by (a reflection of the fine group of peeps I was with), and as midnight approached, I noticed the bar and most of the restaurant were empty... the DJ was packing up and our party moved on as well.  In usual Gabi manner, I headed home to get some beauty sleep.  Thanks again, O&I, for another wonderful meal!",

I went yesterday along with 3 friends at 7:30pm and put our name down for a table (yes there was a wait on a Tuesday, good sign huh? lol) after about 15/20 minutes we were seated and immediately asked for our drink orders (prompt!) Now I really love the service and the ambience (& my Mediterranean salad!) but this place can only receive 3 stars from me. The chef that night had a bit of a heavy hand when it came to the salt because my friend commented on how salty the bread was and then when I received my entree (veal and spinach ravioli) I was taken aback by how salty and small the portion was. Luckily we ordered lamb meatballs as a small plate and I had a half salad during the meal or else I would have left unsatisfied by the cost related to portion size. But I MUST marvel about the Mediterranean salad, it's been a while since I've had a really good fresh salad and Olive & Ivy's Mediterranean salad + shrimp did the job for me but everything else I ate (meatballs and ravioli) plus my red wine sangria were just like my review states, a 2.5/3. I won't write them off completely though, I'm going to say that was just a freak one time incident (so I can go back and get my salad!) haha",

Ohh k, Let's talk food and drinks! the real reason why we even bother, right?  + Sangria: $5, white (lychee, blood orange, peach), red (blackberry, rasberry, strawberry, tempranillo) - decided this be my favorite one of the two, you can get a small sampling before you try, both are not too sweet just right, unfortunately no hard fruits in them but still satisfying  + Flatbreads: $8, there's 5 to choose from, I personally enjoyed the prosciutto crudo (crispy potato, asparagus & fried egg) and piccante (italian sausage & spicy salami), love EGG on my pizzas! spread it over like jelly on a toast!  + Bacon Wrapped Dates: italian sausage & piquillo pepper, you get the sweet and savory, wasn't as crispy but still pleasing  I know some in the group ordered some Bruschetta but I did not get to try.  So can't comment much.  What could I say about service? Attentive, friendly and eye candy.  Just saying, from the host to the bartenders to the servers.  If you were not wow'd by the ultra posh dining and bar area, the bathroom will.  Might be the most stylized toilette I've ever tainted! Let's just say the bathroom stalls have wooden doors!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKzaS1MHg94RGM6z8u9mw?select=IfEvXEYxoJJt5rg7h92Feg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/wUKz...</a>  With little room to complain, Olive and Ivy sounds to me like a winner, winner chicken dinner to help you get through your slacker ways week! ;-p",

Restaurant is in a prime location of Old Town, you can get there from both sides of the bridge (parking garages are close) or they have valet if you prefer that. Both the patio and the inside areas have a nice atmosphere. Good Service. Good Food",

The bloody Mary's are made with fresh vegetable juice and lots of horseradish. Not for the faint of heart but clearly a popular beverage there.  My dining companions and I all had the gyro for lunch which was quite tasty.  Looking forward to dining there again next time I'm in town.",

Food was good, wine list was okay but sommelier lacked basic wine knowledge.  Appetizers were appealing. Salads had balanced flavor and showed up very quickly. Plates were removed as soon as last bite. Bread and pesto provided but only lasted on the table less than 5 minutes. We had to ask for the bread's return. Entrees tasted good too but were in the small side.  Not a bad restaurant but as I said they look to turn you in and out quickly. We were looking for something a little more relaxed.",

Take my advice and there will be peace at the table.]  Where else can you sip on 5$ mimosas, on a balmy Saturday afternoon, in a Mediterranean inspired well manicured backyard? The setting takes you miles away from the brown overloaded Arizona. The ambience and service more than make up for the 'just a notch above mediocre' food. I particularly like taking the unreserved lounge seating and linger around for longer than they may like!  At some places, the food just takes a backseat. Here, it's for a good reason.",

They have a special happy Hour menu, but watch out for the Brushetta part. The prices at $3 are attractive, but they are only giving you $3 worth of food, not a Happy Hour deal or anything. The pumpkin/Hazelnut cheese concoction wasn't even good, moreorless worth the $3 it cost for one slice of bread cut up into three pieces. Are you really that freakin cheap people? It was unhappy Hour in terms of food, but they had AZ craft beers for $5 at HH and although that isn't a great deal, it's the best you can find in this upscale happy hour, which should be renamed. Waitress was nice and staff was polite, but also an aging crowd was hanging out at the bar if your into grey, then head that way.",

It's difficult to get the attention of your waitperson, like they couldn't be bothered, and the atmosphere just feels cold, very anonymous, no warmth from anyone.  Last time, the chefs needed 3 times to make the eggs even acceptable. This time, no one greeted us, bartender was uninterested; the only ones to say hello were the hostesses on the way out. So, yes, great location but as the review says...Meh. I've definitely experienced better.",

We were there celebrating our friends birthday and he was so attentive, fun, and just enough attention but not being annoying! He had great suggestions and was very knowledgeable about the menu! The food was also great!   The reason I gave a 3 star was because I called to make A reservation for the private room and apparently you have to call a separate  number and they are only there Mon - fri 8-4 or something so if you have weekend plans don't waste your time calling because they won't even bother to call you back.  I did call Friday at like 10 am but still I can't even get a call back by four?! This is the second time I have tried to reserve this room and have not received a call. To top it off during the time of the reservation that room was empty!! This probably isn't the restaurants fault so I feel bad giving the 3 stars but I think its kinda crappy I can't  get a call back when this is their job!   I highly recommend this restaurant and Michael but if you have a private party your better off just making reservations in the dining room.",

We really wanted to try some of the delicious-looking desserts, but our main dishes were too filling. What really makes this place shine, however, is the ambiance.

We decided to sit in the patio, which I do highly recommend if you want especially before it starts getting chilly.  The service was lacking.  However, the restaurant is so cute.  We decided to start off with the bruschetta - prosciutto & fig, funghi, and manchego.  My favorite was the funghi, but I love mushrooms.  If you are not a muschroom fan, then I recommend the manchego.  That was good.  There wasn't alot of bruschetta - I think it was 3 slices each. I then ordered the goat cheese tortelli.  One Word - \"YUMMMMMM!\" It was so good.  I love goat cheese. - the goat cheese, sauce, and duck was a great combination.  I practically ate my whole meal.  If licking your bowl wasn't inappropriate, I definitely would of done it.   We finished with gelato at the gelato bar.  Pretty good too.    .",

All were lacking in flavor. The bread was sliced too thick, it was soft inside, and wasn't brushed with oil. Not True bruschetta, more like dip on top of a thick slice of French bread. The hummus was inedible. So much cumin that that is all you could taste. Totally overpowering. Were they trying to give it an Indian influence? My sister's beet salad was fine, but a salad you could find on any menu. My Caesar salad and my sister's flatbread were flavorless. The worst was the \"gelato.\" How they call that gelato is beyond me. Nowhere close to what gelato really tastes like. It was closer to ice milk.  I am not sure why this place is so popular. Perhaps because of the social scene or the ability to sit outside. If you are interested in good food, skip it.",

I was here for a dinner celebration, but we didn't order any flatbreads or sandwiches. Instead, we had a wine and dine experience.   Rib eye - medium rare - perfectly cooked and seasoned with crisp oven potatoes. Big eye tuna - seared only - with leeks and roasted mushrooms. Pork tenderloin - wrapped in bacon. Free range chicken - with English peas and a citrus sauce. Beet salad Fresh mozzarella Fig and prosciutto bruschetta  Everything was decadent and delicious. Good wine selection, I had the Albarino.  Waiters were young and handsome; service was on point. Open kitchen, bodega aisle, and waterfront seating option. Prices were shockingly low for a beautiful restaurant.",

Both times we've ordered the hummus.  It's that good.  It's got a lil kick to it, and it's served with pita bread.  It's excellent.  What else is excellent is their lasagna.  It's some of the best I've ever had!!!  It's served with two little amazing pieces of garlic bread, that's so yummy and pairs perfectly with the lasagna sauce.  If you're really hungry the portion is perfect, if not, it heats up well, so take it home and have it as a midnight shnack ;)  My friend ordered the Med salad and it looked really good and the portion is ginormous.  Overall, this place is awesome  and we will definitely visit again when we're on that side of town.",

We showed up at Olive and Ivy right when they opened at 10AM and were seated immediately outside at a really nice set of comfy couches and chairs.  All of our cocktails were delicious and we loved the fresh bright pesto with warm bread.  There was a coffee shop in the restaurant for those of us who needed more coffee. This was a perfect gathering spot to play a few bridal games and talk.  The seating and ambiance of the patio were perfect and service was very attentive but not too much.",

As far as the food goes, it was very fresh. I ordered a Mediterranean salad with a serving of chicken. The chicken did not come with the restaurant week deal. However, it was just a small extra charge on my bill. It's worth it. The chicken on the salad was so tender.  For my main course I ordered the salmon. It was so tender and so juicy. I got my salmon medium. As far as dessert, I ordered their peanut butter mousse. It was like eating a peanut butter cup! Yum!   I'm addition, I ordered the beet salad. I liked the beet salad way better than their Mediterranean salad. The beet was so fresh and so juicy. The arugula was peppery and crisp. The dressing was creamy and sweet.  I recommend this restaurant! It serves great food with great service!",

The lasagna bolognese was cooked perfectly to my liking. The sauce was also great and very flavorful. The atmosphere is the perfect date night and the restaurant is huge so the wait typically isn't too long. However when we arrived the hostess only had the chefs table available which was side by side and we were okay with that option. When we sat down it was about ten minutes before we were greeted by anyone and another ten minutes after, we were brought water. I'm typically very patient and it may be that they were giving time to have an intimate enjoyable time with who you are with. The service was otherwise friendly though. I would definitely go back and try some of the other option available.",

I wanted to go somewhere that was different, that wasn't too fancy, but was also a little more upscale.  I remembered that I was sent a coupon for a free desert at any Fox Concepts Restaurants.  I was really ping-ponging between Olive & Ivy and another restaurant in Phoenix.  I'm glad that I picked Olive & Ivy because I was so impressed and the food was AMAZING!    This place has an awesome atmosphere. They had a live DJ, their windows/doors were open. It's really a \"grand\" space. The menu is fairly simple, which I understand changes fairly often.  I ordered the sea scallops with polenta and my husband had a salad. I was amazed at how yummy my dish was. (I've never had polenta before so I hope it all tastes like this one!) My husbands salad looked really good too, I even had to have a few bites.  After dinner I ordered the lemon pudding cake. Oh. Em. Gee!  The cake was so light and fluffy and just amazing.    I have to checkout the other restaurant that I decided against next!!!",

The place was always busy but there are plenty of cozy, romantic spots.  There is outdoor seating by the patio under the trees with stringed lights and pretty flowering plants.  It's my favorite spot.  Food was excellent.  If I may suggest the ones I've tried so far: bruschetta, Mediterranean salad, scallops, sea bass, the steak a hefty 18 oz rib eye is very well seasoned with a side sauce that perfectly matches.  Let me defer my review of their dessert to my review of the great service.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating of our requests.  On both occasions, we tried to collaborate with the staff in surprising our companion with a birthday cake.  We snuck to the bathroom and whispered to the staff that our companion was celebrating a birthday and we want a cake with a candle or whatever they have to that effect.  They acquiesced to our request and on the right cue they came out with a delicious cake with nice chocolate syrup birthday greeting on the plate...... all to our companion's pleasant surprise.  Try the delicious lemon cake with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream on the side, or the chocolate ganache with pistachio ice cream.  At the end of the night, you'd come out with a happy palate and an even happier experience.",

Good service. Our waiter was on top of everything and just a good guy.   This is full of rose-swilling, avocado-toast eating, romper-clad millennials. I actually like a good rose and avocado toast, but it wasn't our scene. Lots of bachelorette parties the night we went.   This is a good place for people watching, fun to go with a group. Not great for a date, I wouldn't think. Menu is mostly unremarkable flatbread pizzas and salads.   I might go back for lunch sometime?",

Between the *healthy* food, patio, service and location, it's easy to see why this looks to be one of the most popular grub spots for locals and travelers like myself. The only downside is I don't live close enough to frequent this place.   Our group of six came with a local who knew the place well, so we immediately hit the patio for a table situated in a perfect mix of shade and sun that suited everyone's needs. As soon as I saw they had a salmon caesar salad, combining my dual cravings for fish and salad, I was sold. The salad did not disappoint, with a large piece of perfectly cooked fish, a delicious dressing and some addictive house-made croutons. Throw in the incredible hummus and pesto with fresh bread that started things off and endless refills of Arnold Palmers and you have won my heart.   A note that this is also a great little area to stroll in, especially in the evening. The patio and an adjacent bridge overlook a little canal and there are a lot of shops to peruse.",

We had stopped in the night prior but were unable to get a table until 9 pm as we did not have a reservation. If your heart is set on eating here I would definitely recommend calling ahead!   We all enjoyed a different sandwich: I ordered the grilled chicken panini, my Mom enjoyed the tuna salad, and my Dad had the turkey grinder & a cup of Minestrone soup- all plates were licked clean! Our server was very friendly and attentive. Overall, a great experience!",

I had the kale salad and it was delicious. I like how you can get half sizes. I got the manchego bruschetta. It was good but not my personal favorite. I got the short rib pizza and it was so good ! My friend got the melon salad. She loved it but you should know it has a kick of spice! Then she had the margarita pizza and enjoyed it. We both had the red sangria and it was good not too sweet which is my preference. It is a fun restaurant and I would definite recommend it !",

My fave entree is the pork tenderloin....it's been on the menu for a long time and I hope it continues to be. The presentations are beautiful but not intimidating.  Def book a reservation in advance on the weekend as this place is usually packed (went last week and the wait was 3 hours maybe haha).

I liked how it didn't have so much mint floating in the glass to get caught in the straw.  As for lunch I had the tuna sandwich. It's pretty standard so not much to write about but I'd order it again. Take a walk around the area after you're done. There's a lot to explore.",

We were visiting Scottsdale and staying near Old Town and because I was in the Southwest,  I had this idea that I wanted a cowboy steak (silly, I know) and spent a lot of time looking for the perfect restaurant. It was also my birthday so I wouldnt have minded a splurge. But I couldn't rationalize $80 for a steak, and I wanted to try somewhere FUN. I am SO GLAD I found this restaurant! We had cocktails, a crostini appetizer, and my steak was divine. Really! I'm a fool for not taking pictures! They offered me a birthday dessert too :) Quick uber back to our hotel.

The ambience will definitely give you that shock and awe for a normal Americano/French/Italian vibe very modern I guess. Vaulted ceiling's grand windows to the outdoor patio where you can lounge or sit and eat make sure you make reservations at a time. Their bread is made fresh right before your eyes it with an amazing a Oli dipping sauce with pesto upon request. The service was accommodating and fairly nice. We ordered a bunch of drinks which were absolutely delicious as well as expensive so come here for a good reason maybe not just to grab lunch. I ended up ordering the beat arugula salad thinking it would fill me up for a lunch service. As I do not eat bread, I only ate my beet salad which consisted of one and a half cups full of arugula put on a plate With four small chunks of beads on top of the bed of lettuce a tablespoon of goat cheese some drizzle and that's about it. I was so hungry and embarrassed like am I the only one who is starving after eating my meal LOL. The plate size to give you an idea was 3 inches by about six or 7 inches and it looks like a garnish plate of very small salad maybe like a side salad you could say. I would not suggest this meal for somebody who's actually wanting to eat and get full because it's a side salad. Got out spending $40-$50 and I probably won't be back. But It's a cute spot, the drinks are tasty and the Food is tasty!",

The location is wonderful-quiet and even though it was 105 degrees at 7:30 at night the combination of misters and waterfront location made for a very cool and enjoyable evening on the patio.  Speaking of which, the patio is ridiculously gorgeous.  Seriously, if they are trying for a European feel they nailed it.  Absolutely in love with the patio and the vibe.  The interior is gorgeous as well-just a bit on the loud side.  All depends on what mood you're in.    Our service was outstanding as well-from the time we were greeted, to the drinks at the bar and of course our table service all night was wonderful.  We felt spoiled.  And now on to the food..delicious.  The pesto and bread to start was amazing-some of the best pesto I've had (and it's one of my absolute favorite things).  We also had the fritto misto for an app which was very good.  Main dishes were the bacon wrapped pork and the sweet potato cannelloni-both full of flavor and quality.  We shared the lemon pudding cake for dessert, which was light and refreshing on a hot June night!    All in all, Olive and Ivy exceeded my expectations and we will without a doubt return.  Thank you for making our anniversary special.",

With that as our expectation mindset, we were promptly seated on the patio at our reservation time.  House made foccacia was more like Wonder bread than real bread. Ordered entrees.  Sea bass and duck/goat cheese tortellini.  Very tasty but surprisingly expensive.  (Mall rent?). Wine list expectations were misled by the giant wall of bottles at the entrance.  Turns out most of those are empty and purely a facade.  Did order a couple glasses that were decent.  Waitor was minimally useful with his recommendations.  (\"It all depends what you like.  They're all good.\")  Ordered two desserts.  Brown butter cake and ice cream bar.  Both were excellent and a good value at $5 each.  Waiter was not familiar with them though and struggled to describe the ice cream bar.  Bottom line.  Fair meal.  Lived up to our \"large company mall restaurant\" expectations.  Excellent patio.",

    "text": "The Olive and Ivy... yum!  Just before I came to eat dinner here I happen to be Yelping and Jessica F. quick tipped trying the sangria.  I was late meeting my party of 6 so as I sat down and the waiter took my order I knew I already wanted the sangria - red.  It reminded me of a Framboise I tried at Carly's Bistro, very tasty and fruity, I had two.  The decor was amazing!  The window coverings were plush and the light fixtures were industrial.  There wasn't uniformity to it but it all came together so well.    Upon recommendation from one of the attorneys I was dinning with, I ordered the braised short rib with mascarpone polenta & baby vegetables.  Before the meal arrived the server gave us steak knives but they were useless.  The meat melted like butter and tasted even better.  I had never had polenta before but when I tried it I realized it was basically grits.  I don't particularly care for the texture but I couldn't stop eating them.  And the vegetables were two baby onions and two baby celery, meh, they didn't add anything to the meal.  For dessert I tried the blueberry gelato and it was typical gelato, a great way to end a meal.  Another one of the attorneys had ordered the stuffed ricotta balls and they reminded me of the doughnut holes from Dunkin' Donuts.  All in all, it was a fabulous meal and great company makes the dining experience that much better.  As for the service, I wasn't impressed.  Our server had all of the decorum of someone who worked in fine dining but we rarely saw him.  The dinner lasted two and a half hours and that was mostly because we had to wait so long - wait for drinks, to have our order taken, to get our meal, to order coffee and then dessert, waiting for the check.  Then when we did receive our meals, three people had ordered the same meal but one ordered it with pureed potatoes instead of the polenta.  When the server didn't know which was which he asked them to take a bite and then he switched their plates!  They of course insisted their $26 meals were taken back to the kitchen and corrected.  I wanted to give four stars based on the food but the service lead me to knock off a star.",

There was a limited menu for NYE but that didn't matter, started with hummus and bruschetta trio.... AMAZING!!!!!!!! She had chicken scallopini so good, I found my knife and fork drifting over a few times. I ordered the sea scallops which were hands down the best scallops I have ever had and Chicago isn't short on seafood dining. We cannot wait to return to try out their full menu. To add we sat outside on the patio, and again being from Chicago and able to be dining outside on Dec 31 was amazing. Plenty of patio heaters and the patio is so beautiful at night with the water right there. Fire pits I'm sure are not active in summer months but were a very nice touch.",

    "text": "Oh me oh my, but such a welcoming refuge from the three-digit heat of Arizona. Located at the Waterfront in Scottsdale, which is in fact a man-made canal that is surrounded by a plethora of restaurants, condos, business establishments and a huge indoor mall. Olive and Ivy serves food to order/take out at their deli section, or food to dine in their patio outside under umbrellas and h20 forced mist (misters?). Since it was 120 degrees outside, we chose to chill inside the large dining area near the windows - this way, we still got a nice view of the outdoor patio that borders the beautiful tree- covered walkway along the canal.  The restaurant is very \"foo-foo\" Italian dining in a casual atmosphere. I love ordering the melon salad, which is only served in summer or very hot days - lucky me. The pupu appetizer platter is enough for party of four because of the more than adequate amount of bread served with the other ingredients on the plate (prosciutto, salami, cheese, nuts, dates, etc). A favorite is the tomato/basil soup with complimentary bread and... drumroll... their homemade pesto dipping sauce. Oh drool!  The piece a la resistance was the desert.  Must must must try the oh-my-shshshut-the-door-already peanut butter mousse with smoked sea salt dentelle, topped off with a nutty, crunchy, chocolate shell. Ohhhhhh such delectable joy.  I tell you, I don't know if it was sheer relief from the heat, but boy did I ever have a most orgasmic-ly satisfying meal.  By the way, they also serve and have a good selection of wine/alcohol and beverages at the bar. Our \"tame\" party settled for raspberry drinks with ice water all around.  Great service; great food; great ambiance. May be a little pricey but worth it.",

    "text": "Ok. Let me start by saying that the atmosphere of Olive & Ivy is gorgeous! I will take you through our meal so you know why we didn't love this...let me also disclose that my opinion made even me sad! I started off with a glass of white wine. I got the Chenin Blanc. The wine was delicious BUT it was wayyyy too warm. Having such and extensive wine collection, they should have known to serve more chilled white wine. I could have said something but I didn't, so that is my fault. Every table gets fresh bread and pesto. This was probably the highlight of the meal. It is seriously DELICIOUS! We decided to start with the bacon wrapped dates, recommended by our server. They were...ok. The dates were a bit too smokey and needed more of a salty element. Even with the chorizo and bacon, I found them to be much too sweet. They also had some greenery that was unnecessary. For my meal, I got 3 of the bruschetta. Great concept! You can choose 3 flavors for $12. Sounds amazing right!? BEWARE. The menu discloses GF and Veg. Again, this was MY FAULT but, the menu didn't list all of the ingredients and all of the bruschetta options have cheese on them. I don't eat dairy....so, I basically suffered through my entire meal. The brussels sprout option was 100% the best. The mushroom was pretty good and the prosciutto was less than impressive, unfortunately. My sister got the scallops and said they were pretty good and cooked perfectly! They come with 5 as well as some hearty butternut squash puree. There were chunks of squash that she said were a bit overwhelming and a bit rich. They were missing depth and needed a bit of acidity.   Overall, this wasn't a BAD meal but we were expecting a lot more. I would try it again but I would be much more cautious of what I was ordering and next time I will probably ask for more chilled wine.",

    "text": "We came in on a busy Friday night and lucked out with two seats at the bar.   We ordered the white sangria and bacon wrapped dates as happy hour was about to end. The dates were SO good. White sangria was kind of odd... But not bad.  We split a Caesar salad and the bone in rib eye. They were very accommodating about splitting the food and everything was split prior to us receiving it.   The rib eye was cooked a smidge under medium but it was so good, it didn't even matter. The potatoes were very crunchy and yummy too!  Our bartender was a very friendly man as well, and he made the experience even better!  My boyfriend is not much of a foodie, but he absolutely loved this place. So that's saying a lot!",

We ordered the WILD MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE and the SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI! Both were AMAZINGGGGG! The sweet potato was our favorite which is strange because I usually find it too sweet and rather enjoy spicy pasta. But wow SO SO good!",

I ordered the chopped chicken salad and, while it was delicious, the blue cheese was completely overwhelming. There are so many delicious pieces to the salad that I was looking forward to- the peanut granola being one- and I could not taste any of them but the cheese! I will definitely try them out again though, a drink, appetizer and salad for around $30 was not bad. The coffee bar was amazing too. Got a little latte to go!",

Did not dine on patio as wind was whipping out there but those that did said the fire pits provided adequate warmth to do so. Food was delicious, tried the bruschetta appetizer and the combination of manchego, quince and spanish chorizo was unique and tasty.  Splitting each a beet and kale salad was a great way to taste two different salads, both excellent and not to be missed. Husband had the steak, bone-in rib-eye (huge portion - enough for lunch next day!) with potatoes and spinach done perfectly.  The sea bass was beautiful presentation and very good, but small serving size.  Server was professional and knowledgeable.",

I couldn't stop eating it.  I ended up having the ravioli and veal and it was delicious. When the food came my initial thought was that the serving size was a bit small however once I began eating I realized how thick and rich the ravioli was. I ended up being completely full after that entree. I also had the apricot and cheesecake for desert. It was an interesting combination that I've never had before so I wanted to try it. That was just ok in my opinion. I would've enjoyed just plain cheesecake better. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit here and will definitely return.",

I've frequented everything from the dining to the small grocery style counter and enjoyed most of it. Today was pretty busy so we managed to squeeze a spot on the couch next to the bar. Service was a bit off and negatives included: eggs Benedict was way too soggy, brought our cappuccinos with no sugar or spoon and server vanished after taking the order.  But despite these issues I have to say I would try this place again because the food was previously pretty good. I've never thought anything was excellent or very memorable here but it is convenient and the patio areas are nice.  Still recommended.",

Another ten for them to be cleared and the table was never wiped down there was food and sauce and dried beverages on the table  but never cleaned, asked about the happy hour wine \"it's not good but that's what you get for the price\".  Sangria was terrible.  I understand it is spring break here,however it's no surprise and a restaurant of this caliber should be stepping up their game not saying the wine is bad but that's what you get.  So disappointed and embarrassed that I brought out of town guest to this establishment.",

It was tasty, though a tad bit salty.  Admittedly, I have some regrets about having such a rich dinner, but that was my bad, not a reflection on the restaurant lol.     I loved the decor and vibe at Olive & Ivy.  It's a trendy Scottsdale restaurant, for sure, but it didn't have that pretentious air about it.

I went to Olive and Ivy with some friends for a birthday brunch - the waiter made it a point to say everything is made from scratch, homemade, the bakers got up at 4am to bake, etc.  Super - sounds great.  I ordered the Ivy Sausage sandwich, which is egg, sausage and cheese on a homemade english muffin.  One bite and I get that odd, familiar flavor of my childhood and realize they had put two slices of Kraft American Processed cheese slices on the sandwich.  What?? Are you telling me that Sam Fox can't have a hunk of cheddar cheese in the back for this?  It ruined an already mediocre sandwich that tasted like it came from a Jimmy Dean freezer box.  I scraped the cheese off the other half and tried to move on, but I'm still angry.  The two stars are for the good cup of cappuccino and the free dessert the waiter brought my friend, which was amazing.  Oh, and for using Open Table so we could make reservations and not have to wait.  None of my friends were terribly impressed with their meal either.",

Although the food was very good, the service was mediocre at best, the server really had a \"no care\" attitude.  We had to ask for place settings, then our food came out before our appetizers which was very disappointing.  This could be a sign of the times and the business may be circling the drain.  Worth a try though, the food is very good.",

I had the Parmesan risotto as my entree. I liked the roasted cloves of garlic that gave bursts of flavor. The shrimp was cooked just right, not rubbery. Drinks were not watered down, and were very well priced for dining in and around Old Town and the Waterfront. The atmosphere/decor is spot on as well and the staff was very attentive. Can't wait to go back!",

They seemed concerned asked if I wanted to order something else but I was done at that point. I was stunned that they didn't comp something on our bill they still charged us- not even a wine comp.

Great guy, very knowledgable and helps you chose, without any negative opinion. I highly recommend when you go here, you specifically ask to have this guy wait on you. Next, the atmosphere. What a great place! Very romantic. As my wife(laura) stated below, we fell back in love and just focused on ourselves and not anything else around us. Glad I made reservations, because it seemed dead when we first got there (6pm) and filled up shortly after we sat down. The wife and I both commented on how cool the bathrooms were. You don't see that every day,lol. Every time we left our table, any worker walking by, would re-fold our napkin. That was really nice, and we loved it. Onto the food. We ordered the Bruschetta Trio as the appetizer. WOW, what a great start out. Very good. We really got full off this so we ordered a salad and Chicken Scallopini. They split both for us, which was very nice of them. Salad was very fresh and good. I highly recommend the chicken meal we had. Very very good and seats well with your stomach and a glass of wine. We ordered a bottle of Ramon_B wich was $40. It was a limited bottle, but worth every penny for the meal and atmosphere. Then we ordered the peanut butter Ice-cream bar for dessert. The marshmellow did not taste good. Seemed still frozen, but was still too much and just didn't go with the whole dessert. We told Tim about it and he said he would pass it on. The best bonus of this was when we came in, we told Tim we were Yelpers and were looking up what to get. Tim remembered this, told the manager, and gave us our Dessert for FREE, without even mentioning it to us. Guys, if you want to wooo your wife, and have one of the best romantic nights, even for just visiting one night, this is the place!! Great job Tim and Olive & Ivy!!",

The food was brought out to us very promptly and the presentation of the food was great, the thing that impressed me the most was that my boyfriend had ordered the sea scallops and i had ordered the awesome lasagna we had asked to \"split the orders so that we could share\" they beautifully arranged the two dishes on a rectangular plate and a bowl so it looked as though the two dishes were suppose to be together and they split the orders and put it on one plate, I have never seen this done before in any restaurant.The waiter was very attentive and very nice. The other item you need to ask for is the pesto and bread,that is a must, so delish! I even looked up for any other FOX restaurants that might be in California which I plan on visiting since I had such a great experience at this restaurant. the next time I come to Scottsdale I surely stop by here again!. Thanks Olive and Ivy for a memorable eating experience!",

The beet salad and filet medium were what I order this last time around.  Both tasty and above average.  The others ordered the steak and bruschetta I believe.  Everyone seemed happy with what they ordered.  Not the best meal of all time but good food, nice decor, healthy ambiance, and decent service.  The patio is nice any time of the year.  Although funny, because they consider the water behind it to be water front as though it's a river.  I don't think so.  I looks like all of the typical SRP water tributaries in the area.  It doesn't hurt certainly but water front - NOT.  Anyways, go there for a late happy hour and you won't be disappointed.",

We took our waiters suggestions on splitting a few salads (that we couldn't choose from) and a beef short rib flat bread. Everything was delicious. The manager was very visible and he took the time to explain their olive oil and Parmesan Reggiano  qualities. It happened to be a beautiful day and the outdoor seating was perfect. We watched a lot of dishes come out of the (open) kitchen and everything looked wonderful. I believe they really use fresh ingredients, cooked to order and beautifully presented. When visiting Scottsdale, or any of their other cities, I will absolutely return to Olive & Ivy.",

I have always enjoyed the atmosphere at this restaurant for a business lunch - relaxed, not stuffy, not too noisy (but not too quiet), attentive staff and pretty good and affordable food.  This is why I choose it relatively frequently.  When we sat down this time our waitress had difficulty answering a question.  Immediately her colleague, who was within earshot, came over, as she was explaining that she was new on the job.  He answered the question and also assisted her throughout the meal with several other questions about what was in the food (important due to allergy issues).  As my colleague was enjoying his sandwich, he observed that there was not very much filling, although what was there tasted great.  When they came by to ask how things were, he shared that comment, to which the response was \"we'd be happy to provide more if you would like\" - very good response.  Later, when the bill came, we were told that our dessert was on the house for sharing our comments.  Totally unexpected.  An example of a great service attitude that more restaurants would be well to copy.",

    "text": "I went to Olive & Ivy for the first time Wednesday 5/22 for lunch. My mother and I were out running errands and she suggested that we stop and eat at Olive & Ivy.  Since this is a Fox restaurant and the prices are toward the higher end of the spectrum, I was expecting an enjoyable experience and some great food. Unfortunately, I was hugely disappointed.  First, we were seated in the east section of the outside patio. There were probably 3-4 other tables that were occupied in that section when we arrived. We waited for approximately 10 minutes before the waiter decided to come over and ask us if we wanted something to drink. We should have realized that this was time to go, but since we were there...we decided to have some lunch. We started with Sour Cherry Palomas which were very very sour and I would suggest that they remove from the menu.   Our stellar waiter continued his amazing service by not bringing us bread until my mother asked, and he forgot to bring us water after we asked 2 times. I also had to ask twice for some sweetener. Once again, maybe we should have pulled the rip cord at this point and ditched out....whoops!  We ordered Frito misto, which was a highlight of the lunch for me. The breading was nice and the dipping sauce was tasty. Another chance for our waiter to screw up. In his 4 subsequent trips to the table, he neglected to clear away the empty appetizer plates. Our water glasses also both ran dry while we ate the appetizer and were not refilled until we explicitly asked.  I asked for a suggestion between the turkey grinder, lamb gyro and chicken panini sandwiches. Our waiter raved about the gyro, so I went with that suggestion. Once again, bad call on my part. Approximately 20 minutes later my gyro and my mother's salad arrived. I ordered a side salad with gorgonzola vinaigrette. My salad had no dressing, and when I tried to catch my waiter's attention, he did not acknowledge me. The gyro included lamb patties which I would say were probably the worst tasting meat I've ever tasted. This was not a good gyro. It tasted more like lamb meat loaf.  We waded through our entrees and finished our drinks. Our waiter never returned to ask how things tasted and he didn't seem to care when I told him my salad had no dressing. We asked for our check, and it was another 7-10 minutes before he was back.   All I can say is Olive & Ivy is a one hit wonder for me. There are lots of other restaurants in the neighborhood that have much better food and service. I'd recommend Bungalow or R&R or just about any restaurant other than Olive & Ivy.",

It is bothersome to me when they take away a plate when there is still food on it (and don't ask) and take away your drink when it is almost still half full.  Those are just silly mistakes.  Otherwise, the hummus, bacon wrapped dates. lamb meatballs and gnoochi were all worth the calories. Dessert not so much (I think it was the ice cream bar).  I think it is definitely a great place to spend some time and hang out.",

    "text": "I am so sad that I have to give this restaurant a bad rating. I took my mom here to have a fabulous Mother's day dinner and to have a delightful finale to our mother-daughter trip. The food and the service were fabulous. We started with three different bruschetta (you can mix). They were all amazing. We then had the house salad which had a wonderful light dressing, all very fresh. We split the salad and the portions were still huge! For dinner I had the sweet potato cannelloni and my mom had fish (I can't remember which one and I can't view the menu).   Why the bad review you might ask? My mom woke up at 6am with HORRIFIC FOOD POISONING. I felt so awful, we even had to fly out that day. She was miserable. Some might say that food poisoning can happen even when cooking in your own home and that its not their fault but I find it inexcusable. Keeping ingredients fresh, the kitchen clean and correct cooking temps should avoid all food poisoning. We ate and shared the same dishes all day for breakfast and lunch so I know that it was from Olive and Ivy. Could have been the fish or the lettuce. We were skeptical about getting fish in Arizona in the first place but my mom decided to go for it....bad choice :(",

We asked if we could have the dinner menu in the happy hour area and were told that the lounge was strictly HH which was odd. So we sat at a table in the patio with dinner menus. The menu was pretty good however they are only limited to half the dinner menu at 3 which didn't make sense to give a full dinner menu , but we did with it.  We order a bruschetta with too much cheese and no spicy chorizo, the lamb meat balls which I enjoyed and the short rib flatbread which I loved! The service was ok. We ordered wines and our server spilt over an ounce on the table and cleaned off the menus but not the table which really made it uncomfortable to eat knowing I had puddles around me , also I didn't get that lost wine back. Bottom line, food is good, ambiance is great, and service was ok. Will potentially return , but definitely no rush",

I tried to be cool about it, but failed.  I also failed being cool about the complimentary fresh focaccia bread and pesto they bring out, because the waitress brought us another round.  I ordered the gnocchi with duck confit, and it was absolutely stunning.  I tried telling my husband it was terrible, but my face betrayed me...he ate half.  Which was OK, because I got to eat half of his dish, which I remember as some sort of seafood with risotto, and the best-tasting cherry tomatoes I have had, outside of my grandmother's back yard.  Then, we ordered three scoops of very good gelato from their counter (for only $5!).  Oreo cheesecake gelato?  Yes.  Excellent food, top to bottom, and not as expensive as it could be.  Please go, but again, make a reservation.",

    "text": "12/2/10  2.5 stars.  Took my young cousin w/ me for happy hour and sat at the bar; This was her first time at O&I.  While I really like the look and the feel of the island layout of O&I's bar, I always feel like a fish out of water when I sit there.  (I've actually tried sitting there a few times when I've walked in solo, but always ended up moving to a table.  If it weren't for my cousin at my side, I probably would've moved to a table again, or, worse yet, walked out of the resto, which I've done before, too.)  Despite a few attempts at getting her to try a cocktail, she declined, and thus I proceeded to just order a glass of wine.  Why it's so hard to get a sampling of a couple of wines before settling on one to order here, I'll never know.  (Just a few nights ago, while at Beckett's Table, my server offered to have me try sips of the two wines I was having trouble choosing!)  Tsk, tsk, tsk!  We decided to try the Italian Sausage flatbread and the hummus app.  The flatbread, w/ its tasty and spicy Italian sausage chunks, consisted of a crispy crust w/ vibrant red piquillo peppers and creamy goat cheese-- I'd order this again, even though peppers and I don't exactly get along.  The hummus was equally delightful, w/ house-made pita bread and a \"petite Greek salad,\" which actually consisted of only sliced red grape tomatoes and chopped cucumbers (a no-no for me!) and a ton of feta on top.  Why the salad was piled ON TOP of the hummus, and not on the side, I don't know.  I suppose for the price of the app, I shouldn't expect more veggies used (a bit of lettuce, perhaps?), but it would've been nice to be able to pick the cukes out.  Served as it was, on top of the hummus, which looked like it was baked for a few minutes before getting the salad treatment, spooning the cukes off would've entailed major loss of delicious baked hummus goodness.  And we wouldn't have any of that!  I really wished we could've stayed past 6p to check out the celebrity guest bartender, but we had other appointments to keep.  My cousin really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I'd have given this review another 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our bartender gave us such an attitude when I asked to sample the two wines first before ordering.    FYI, the happy hour menu changed, drastically reduced to only maybe 8 items or less, down from practically all of the apps and half of the flatbreads and a couple of salads that the old HH menu contained.  Recalling this, plus the wine and salad/hummus incidents, I may just have to say goodbye to O&I for a long, long time...",

    "text": "Went here with some out-of-town friends on Sat night.  Their pick - so glad they made this choice.    Excellent service with a top notch, well informed waiter.  Between 4 of us, we ordered a variety of items including the hummus appetizer (just spicy enough), sweet potato cannelloni, veal & spinach ravioli, some new tortellini dish and a rib eye steak dinner.  I tried bites of everything and all I can say is WOW!  It was all I could do the stop myself from jumping into the dish and rolling around in the sauce.  Very fresh and sauces were light, not the heavy pasta thing you might expect.    The only minor criticism is the house salad.  People, it's just a bowl of lettuce - NO enhancements, not even a lone crouton.  The vinaigrette dressing helped make up for the lack in the bowl but I think they really need to consider perking up the lonely lettuce.  It's kind of a loud atmosphere indoors.  We were seated in a cozy booth that faced the patio so some of the noise was blocked.  They had some kind of dj-something playing music and a few people dancing (??) behind us.  Still it was quiet enough for conversation at our booth.  The patio looked very inviting, that could be a good location for next time (yes, there will be a next time).  I highly recommend reservations here.  Fortunately we did have them and were seated right away.  Just in front of us were 4 people who were walk-ins and were apparently told it was a 3 hour wait??  Needless to say, they were walk outs after that news.    Anyway, I'm a new fan here.  Looking forward to more culinary experiences with Olive & Ivy.",

I thought was BS but when I last stopped by I couldn't get a drink due to this mind set from the bartenders. The last area of critical improvement needed is all limo guys who hang out on your front patio down at the end, smoking and using the area like a Walmart break room. The best of all is the no dogs rule on the front patio.....really! Back of house good.....front of house needs major improvement.",

My boyfriend got the scallops which he devoured. There were five huge scallops along with corn and asparagus. I got the chicken chopped salad which was also so good. The granola is an interesting touch but was pretty tasty (was hard to imagine granola in a salad when I ordered). It was rather inexpensive ($14) and was seriously huge (so much chicken, avocado, and goat cheese) I could only eat a thirdish of it.

    "text": "After strolling along the Canal Convergence Light Exhibit, we were ready for our 8:15 dinner reservation a little early but they graciously were able to sit us at 8pm.   The bustling bar with the staggered Edison style glass lighting hanging from the chic adorned ceilings and a DJ to my right reminded me of being in Vegas. I nudged my hubby with surprise, \"Wow! The music sounds just like the playlist I listen to when running!\" It was pop hits remixed with house and dance music. So lively and energetic. Ladies were dressed to the nines in high heels and beautiful dresses. Couples snuggled in close at booths and at the bar. The older crowd appeared to coincidentally find themselves enjoying the inviting patio where the music was still present but not as loud.  Our table was nestled between the patio and the main room. It felt like the best of both worlds because we were so close to the patio with the open glass doors yet behind another glass wall away from the \"bustling\" main area.   Although my hubs did not want to go exactly with what the waiter recommended, we ordered the exact bruschettas that he talked about, because hey, apparently we all share the same taste in food!! Prosciutto and fig. Manchego and Spanish Chorizo. Butternut squash, goat cheese, and pistachio.   Bry ordered the bouillabaisse. The broth was amazing. What can I say? I managed to taste a clam with some broth but he basically devoured the rest of the seafood mix before my very eyes.  The Prosciutto and Marscapone Tortelli was what my eyes fancied since I first looked at the menu online for some reason. After tasting it, my taste buds were so happy. It could be because I'm partial prosciutto but when matched with Marscapone. That's just ridiculous. Butternut squash and pearl onions added varying textures and complemented the tortelli.   We didn't need dessert, but we ordered it. Bry enjoyed the thin mint gelato which of course was inspired by the season of Girl Scout Cookies. Awesome gelato. My sweet Apple dessert had super red apples glazed in sweet thick syrup, so evil, it was. I was a moo and slowly battled eating those apples, spongy type cake and vanilla bean gelato.   Don't worry. I was able to wash it all down with a pitcher of red sangria.   Our waiter was super attentive, friendly, and informative. The food was great. Another Sam Fox restaurant has won me over. Darn it!",

I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. I've ordered the bruschetta (you can't go wrong with any of them) , the hummus ( all good) and the meat and cheese board . Drinks were great with a few unique twists .   This time we had artichoke hearts( delicious ) . The dressing made the dish . We had a Margherita flatbread that was great - the ends had some crust , like a pizza . The sea bass had a cauliflower puree that was caramelized and some grapefruit that was preserved, wow !  If your a fan of mushrooms you'll love the wild mushroom pappardelle . Pasta dish - cleaned the plate .   The sangria was also great - chose the white over the red , tasted a little sweeter with the berry taste - both were very good though .   It's a no brainer - we'll go back time and time again . Any of the Fox Concepts restaurants give an all class experience.",

Menu items that remain my favorite for brunch include the Turkey Grinder and Chicken Panini. For dinner I really like the Fungi Trifoliati flatbread, Mediterranean Salad (with either salmon well done or chicken), Sweet Potato Cannelloni, and Natural Chicken. The flatbread and salad are available on their lunch menu as well!  As I've mentioned in my previous reviews, the pesto and bread they serve is absolutely phenomenal. The patio area is great for a group get togethers. We've been out there a few times just to enjoy cocktails and appetizers. The main dining room also provides a great ambiance for a group dinner or intimate date night. We'll be back!",

Nice place, nice atmosphere, kinda of romantic I should say too because of the lights, but definitely a good options for girls nights or even family dinner. You make it your own. I really like the food, but honestly here are my favorite: ready?? The Lasagna Bolognese with a Belvedere Blue Martini. Honestly this lasagna is so tiny/small that you will eat it in one or two bites (and so overpriced) but it is DELICIOSO!!! And the martini... well, it is Belvedere... you don't need more explanations, hello?? Haha. (please do not have more than 2, especially if it is your first date). Oh yeah, back to the subject. Last time I was there, we had a large group, 45 minute wait, but it was a Saturday night in Scottsdale, so nothing out of the normal... Oh, there is a DJ on Saturday nights, it is not obnoxious, so do not get intimidated if you do not like clubs, you can still hear what people say (well not at the bar) but the rest. If the weather is nice, I highly recommend to eat in the patio, all those lights make it so peaceful and romantic ... awwee... I need a boyfriend haha. Enjoy!!!",

Not because of the food (though that was delish), but because of our server, Clenard.  We came in, sat for maybe ten minutes, when he came over, profusely apologized for our wait, and informed us he'd be getting us bruschetta on the house. Then, as we proceeded to order, he was incredibly attentive and helpful. My friend got around four Arnold palmers, and he kept them coming!! He was cordial, kind and incredibly professional. Then we also received dessert on the house (for a wait that, honestly, was NOT bad). Everyone was wonderful, and I'm sure clenard is a reflection of the entire staff and restaurant.   Because of this amazing server (and, not to forget, an awesome meal of the lamb meatballs and artichoke heart salad) I am set on being a regular here.  I've never leave reviews but because of the quality of service and meal, I must. Thank you!",

He explained the menu item-by item in the the most intricate and juicy detail. Actual quotes: \"I personally recommend the ice cream bar. I dream about this dessert when I sleep at night and I have to beg the chef to make it for me the next day. Creamy, indulging, satisfying\" After his 5-minute spiel, our table was already sold on every item he listed. He wasn't just a waiter; he was a poet.  The appetizers were particularly good, with the bacon-wrapped dates taking the gold for the most creative and delicious plate. The pesto here is great; make sure to request some with your bread. Also consider the beet salad, which was my favorite among the greens.  I had the natural chicken as my entree and while it sounds like a very basic dish, I enjoyed every bite of it. The chicken was moist and slightly tangy while the yukon puree adorned the sides of the plate.   Finally, the ice cream bar ended the feast on a perfect note. It is served with a steak knife so you can carve out your bite from the log of rich deep chocolate+toffee ice cream  Distinguishing factor: this place takes the bacon-wrapping trend to a new level with the bacon-wrapped dates. The plate was the star of our table.",

Looking back we probably shouldn't have gone the tapas route as the options were quite limited, but as New Yorkers this is what you usually do at a \"Mediterranean\" style restaurant. We did the brushetta trio (two were great, the pear was bland) and the bread was not brushetta style at all (was thick bread rather than thin). The artichoke hearts were good but sort of more of a salad than we expected. The lamb meatballs were fine but nothing memorable. The kale salad was super boring, consisting almost entirely of kale and very little toppings. Overall, I think we would come back for a drink only and eat somewhere else.",

We went on a Friday night, and there was an awesome house DJ spinning...which automatically gets you points in my book!  Wine and cocktails were good and most of the food was as well.

Olive and ivy is a classy establishment and I would have liked the music to reflect that; instead we had club songs being spun by a DJ.

We always ask for a second helping because it's so delicious! We loved everything from the artichoke appetizer to the strawberry tart dessert. What really made this restaurant experience stand apart was the truly exemplary service from Frank.  He was just the right amount of attentive without being in your face. Frank had a wonderful sense of humor and provided prompt service. The atmosphere was also just perfect for a date night. We actually sat on the patio, even though it was 101 out today but with the shade and the misters it was a perfect temperature. My husband and I would highly recommend Olive & Ivy in future to any couple looking for a romantic night out in Scottsdale! Next time we go, we will definitely request a seat in Frank's section!",

Super trendy with lots of different light fixtures, beautiful big couches with retro designed fabric, different textured walls in different rooms, and one of the most gorgeous patios in all of AZ. I have been here twice. Once was many years ago for my wedding dress shopping day. I remember loving this location and they let us have our own room for no extra charge but I don't remember what we had. I just remember being super pleased after we left. I came back with my husband a few weeks ago and we had lunch. We started with the bacon wrapped figs, something I highly suggest. They are a perfect starter. Tons of flavor, savory from the sausage and bacon, then sweet with the date and peppers, and it's the perfect size. Then we had the bruschetta and the Short Rib Flatbread. I really wasnt please with the bruschetta at all. That would be my -1 star. But the Short Rib Flatbread was great. Tender Short Rib, creamy Gorgonzola cheese, smoked onions, and arugula. You can't go wrong. Can't wait to come back and try their dinner, and sit on that gorgeous patio now that it has cooled down.",

The patio is alongside the canal in old town and is adorned with string lights and trees that make you feel like you're somewhere romantic like Italy. The inside is dimly lit with an open kitchen and a great place for a date or drink with friends. They also have a few beautiful private rooms. The food is all good across the board- fresh and Id say the selection is between American and Italian. They are always accompanied to my allergy and have modified a few dishes for me. They make almost everything in house or know the ingredients source so they are knowledgeable about what i should and shouldn't eat. The focaccia bread, pastas, Malbec wine and red sangria are fantastic! The one thing is that I've gone quite a bit and the food just isn't amazing enough to warrant a 5. It's 'good' but not anything i crave or would gush over more or less. The portions are also a little small for the price I feel I'm never fully satisfied.",

We were seated almost immediately, and greeted to warm smiles from the hostesses.   The ambience is pretty casual, but it has an upscale feel to it. The inside is a little noisy but not overly at all. I'm hoping to return so I can sit in the courtyard when it isn't so hot out! It was extremely beautiful out there.   Our server was very attentive and was always checking on us, which was impressive due to the high volume of people at  the lunch rush.   I ordered the Margarita Flatbread. It was absolutely delectable! The thinness of the bread allowed for you to eat the whole thing without feeling heavy or gross like normal pizzas do. It was extremely flavorful with each bite.  My guests ordered the Chicken Panni. They split it, and the server was kind enough to tell the kitchen to actually spilt it on two plates for them (added bonus). It was also very, very good. They had no complaints.  From the time we ordered our food, it was about 12 minutes until we got it. And about 5 minutes after ordering, we got the bread with pesto (?) dipping sauce.   We were all OBSESSED with the bread and pesto dipping sauce. I'm not even a fan of pesto, but this was perfectly crafted. Again, our server went above and beyond to tell us the ingredients to warn us Incase of allergies.   Olive and Ivy is a FANTASTIC restaurant that I will definitely be returning to. I'd recommend this to anyone in the area!",

    "text": "What a fun spot. Im digging the vibe here. A touch of lavish elegance mixed with a touch of casual warmth. A great dinner spot for a date or with friends. We started with the fig mules, yummy, love those. $11, size was OK. Bread with homemade pesto, nice touch. Our server was honest and informative. He steered me away from flatbread stating there are much more unique things to try, which he was right. I ordered the mushroom parpadelle, yum, great flavor. Garlicky and salty, in a light sauce with al dente noodles. My husband got the natural chicken and it was in such a yummy citrus juice, but still hearty with the potatoes. We finished off with the peanut butter mousse, it disappeared quickly. It was great to split between two people. Our check totaled to $64 before tip, and for a nice little casual date night that seemed on par. Definitely check out this spot!",

The Red Sangria and Mojito are positively refreshing. Lasagna bolognese contains fresh made noodles. I watched the chef roll those delightful starchy chains right out of the machine. We are thrilled to have ended our Labor Day at this location. Without question we will be back and we will bring our friends. Nice break from the ordinary dining experience.  Atmosphere is beautiful and unique. Peanut butter mouse-fascinating-hard chocolate, light mouse and an airy powder.",

My wife is gluten free and they had a number of dishes to choose from.",

    "text": "Visiting from Washington State.  I heard this place was good, so I took my mom to Olive and Ivy for lunch.  I ordered the turkey grinder and she ordered a salad.  The salad looked good, but I immediately distrusted the grinder they made for me.  The taste was all wrong.  It was very sour, like someone had dumped a ton of vinaigrette all over it.  The bread was way too hard, almost comically so, making it impossible for anyone to eat the damned thing without exerting a reasonable amount of effort.  After a few bites, I became astutely aware that my mouth was bleeding from the razor-like bread slicing into my gums.  I refused to eat anymore and sent my lunch back.  The manager graciously offered to pay for our lunch, due to the fact that their food had actually made me bleed.  Receiving a free lunch was nice, even though I left the establishment hungry and bleeding.  Although, I'm certain my mother enjoyed her experience, I certainly didn't.  I will not be returning to Olive and Ivy, due to the obvious lack of common sense exhibited by the people making the food, the people checking the food for abnormalities (like dangerously hard breads), and the management for their lack of oversight and ability to properly analyze their product.  Serving the right bread should be easy.  Unfortunately, Olive and Ivy made it look very difficult.  Any restaurant that fails so heavily on such mediocre and simple issues should be shunned and avoided.",

We got the vegetable scramble and prosciutto flatbread pizza.   I would highly recommend getting the prosciutto flatbread.

The potatoes are delicious and worth getting with your breakfast choice.",

The patio was a gorgeous atmosphere! The waitress was friendly and went through the favorites on the menu. We ordered wine and bruschetta to start--quite good! We thought 3 bruschetta for $11 was a fair price. They also brought bread and pesto dipping sauce.  The food was very good. The leg of lamb was excellent, as was the chicken scallopini.  It was a relaxing meal, especially sitting out on the patio with the canal in the background.  Definitely make a reservation for weekend dinners, as it is always busy.",

We started with the bacon wrapped dates and the salmon, avocado and prosciutto bruschetta, all of which were fantastic.  We all ordered mixed drinks, and we all enjoyed them.

We couldn't decide were to go for brunch so I yelped \"bloody mary\" and O&I came up so being alcoholics we needed our morning fix...well by the time we woke up and came here it was noon. We were able to make resos through opentable and got seated really quickly. Upon being seated we were greeted by our server and ordered drinks- Bloody Mary & Gin Greyhound.   Bloody Mary- good mix to it, it wasn't watery. Garnish was a bit bare, but my second one they stepped up the garnish game (olives, lemon & celery). I love BMs were  you can get a lot of garnishes. My friend hates gin, but he said that was one of the best grey hounds! You can't even taste the gin. They were pretty generous on the alcohol portion as we left with a great buzz.   Now on to the food! The house bread that came with pesto dipping sauce made it all better. I love bread with good dipping sauce. Plus one for that! I couldn't decide if I wanted breakfast or lunch as now it's noonish and it's already really hot in Scottsdale. So my friend and I decided to order lunch portions and split it. We got the prosciutto flatbread and the lamb gyro. I'm glad we got both because O&I is mediterranean and it didn't disappoint. The highlight was the prosciutto crudo flatbread with an egg on top. They also had basil and rosemary potatoes on the flatbread. It was soo good and portions were generous. We were able to take half the flatbread back and ate it a few hours later and it still tasted good!  *Side note: One of the bartenders looked like Manny Pacquiao,,,and we came on the fight weekend. We really wanted to go up to him and say \"hey you're going to be late for your fight\" but I'm sure he gets shit from everybody that weekend.",

Interestingly enough, our group was one of four bachelorette parties there that night! We were originally seated at a table, but, after talking with our waiter, we were able to move our five person group to a much more roomy, comfortable booth. The restaurant has great ambience - it felt very cozy and had a fun atmosphere. We tried the following: various bruschetta, the kale salad, and a bunch of different entrees. Everything was delicious! Somehow we were able to save enough room for dessert - we all tried the gelato!",

    "text": "Even tho this is a fairly large restaurant - I would recommend making reservations. Also, if you want to sit on the patio you need to tell them when you make your reservations. We didn't know that, but wish we had known because the patio was so charming & delightful. The inside was quite noisy, but we did enjoy watching the chefs at work in the open kitchen. But it was our server that made our whole experience at the restaurant a wonderful evening. Nikki was the kind of person that is full of personality, wit and charm - someone you would love to have sit down and join you for dinner!! Efficient, knew the menu backwards & forwards and we loved all of her suggestions. The Chefs are amazing! Watching them work in the open kitchen was both fascinating and inspiring - and the food was fabulous! Everything is made in house and was delicious. There were several different kinds of Bruschetta and we enjoyed each of the three that we ordered. The beet salad was wonderful as was the Mediterranean salad. The flavors in the sweet potato cannelloni were both unique and wonderfully seasoned & delicious. The mushroom pasta was equally as good, and my husband throughly enjoyed his natural chicken & mashed potatoes. At the suggestion of our server we ordered the lemon pudding cake for dessert ......yes.... it was wonderful. We definitely will come back on our next trip!",

The food is incredible, amazing ambiance, and the service is top notch.  The mushroom pappardelle was delicious, killer salmon with beets and potatoes, fresh baked focaccia with house made pesto is a must to start with. Various bruschetta appetizers are a great start.  Desserts all made in house are amazing, had lemon cake, strawberry shortcake were insanely good.  Wine list is really strong as well and we loved the bottle of Sangiovese we had.  We will be back anytime we visit Scottsdale!  An unforgettable dining experience!",

Luckily, we found Olive & Ivy. We made a reservation for 7:15 that night. We were seated immediately at a cute table by the window that overlooked the canal. First, the atmosphere here is amazing! It was cozy yet had a young and fun atmosphere.  We had one vegan and one vegan/vegetarian in our party of 4. Our waiter Easton was phenomenal. He recommended the perfect (strong, well-made) cocktails that really started off our night on the right note. As we were ordering our meals, Easton suggested adding medium-cooked salmon to one of the salads and it was a fantastic choice.   The best part of the service was that Easton noticed two in our party were ordering vegan. So without even having to ask, he brought out our appetizers with all the dairy on the side so the vegans didn't have to pick it off (we ordered the artichoke and hummus apps). It was so thoughtful! Definitely a great restaurant choice for those looking for vegan or veg options. Our party had a flatbread, 3 salads, bruschetta and the appetizers. Everything was fantastic. We were all trying each other's food at the end!   We could not have asked for better service or food and for the location, the prices were great too. The bride was thrilled with our last minute change of plans. We will for sure be back!",

Great ambiance, attentive service, trendy, and a great effin food. We had the prosciutto cudo flatbread which had the obvious, Rosemary mashed- like potato, basil, and a sunny-side egg on top. We also had the lamb gyro which was really really tasty and the portions were extremely generous. We are both fatties and walked away more than satisfied. I highly recommend both dishes. As for the drinks, we had the bloody and the greyhound. Both were super good and strong. Check it out!",

This place is huge!!! It has multiple sections, outdoor shaded patio, full bar with TVs, event rooms, dinning area, and open kitchen. It's modernly designed and decorated. Initially I was worried about not having the reservation and might have to wait for a seat. Nope! We were able to be seated right the way. Their brunch menu is pretty simple. Few items on traditional breakfast and few items for sandwiches and flatbread. They also have a desert and coffee section so they offer full espresso bar items. I decided to go with plain orange juice for a hot day and my friend had latte. Excellent start for our brunch. They served complimentary bread, which was okay. I had their LAMB GYRO, which is a wrapped in a large pita bread with tomatoes, lettuce. It was wonderful!! It looks plain at the first sight but don't let it fool you. The flavors are excellent! The lamb gyro was well reasoned, juice, just perfect for the wrap. I had a side salad to balance the dish. It was really good. I loved the vibe of this restaurant. It's beautiful, it's casual, it's serving good food.",

    "text": "I can't rave enough about Olive & Ivy. At the recommendation from my broker, my mother and I went out to celebrate my move to Scottsdale. We walked up and were in awe of the high ceilings, the open floor plan, marketplace area, and really modern decor. We had made a reservation and headed out to the patio. The patio is sectioned off in to two sections: one as more of a lounge with big chairs and couches, while the other is more dining-appropriate. As we were seated the overhead lightbulb strands lit up along the waterfront, I was in absolute heaven. If I had been nervous about my move, this little setting put me completely at ease.       Our waiter (which I shall call the Lord of all Waiters) came to bring us water and ask if we wanted anything to drink, we had both decided on Sangria, and he encouraged us to get a pitcher--I always enjoy an enabler. While he brought back our pitcher and delicious, but not Too sweet Sangria, we ordered the Artichoke heart appetizer. He even had this split for us so we didn't have to portion the starter ourselves. The hand grated Parmesan, Artichoke hearts and arugula were outstanding. Both my mother and I had already started commenting on the greatness of the flavor combinations.        The Lord of Waiters stopped by frequently, asking about my trip, checking on our waters, refilling our Sangria as it got low, talking about Downtown Scottsdale....he really knew how to make us feel special. He then brought us house-made pesto and bread; I could've eaten the pesto as a meal in and of itself it was so fresh.         Finally, our entrees came out. My mother got the Sweet Potato Cannelloni while I opted to try the Sea Bass. As I ate my snow peas, sea bass and grapefruit combo in absolute contentment, I caught myself humming along to The Notorious B.I.G. this is when the greatest waiter of all time told us they have a DJ every night that spins great mixes (which I can attest to, I was constantly saying \"I love this song!\")      To top off our extravagant meal, we had a scoop of Vanilla Bean gelato to split. The Vanilla Bean was upfront, not overpowering but just right. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect meal (or waiter). I can't wait to start getting visitors so I can take them here and show this place off!",

My Desert Blossom cocktail was pretty good. I would def order again. My friend was a tad late, so they gave away my reservation. Atleast they were nice about it, and seated us 6 minutes later. We were seated close to the open kitchen, service was good. I just didn't feel the food was so outstanding. The food arrived almost immediately, which in a way is good, but really makes me wonder if it was freshly made.  I think part of the issue is that sitting outdoors when it gets dark adds to the ambience, magical twinkling lights. I didn't feel the seating inside really had great ambience, so I might give this place another try in the fall.  Our fritto mist was OK, not great. My salad was great, but def not the best meditteranean salad i have ever had. Artichokes.. OK.....  I'll put this one on my back up list to try again.",

Great large outdoor seating selection for big groups as well as smaller, nook-like areas for couples.. Sat outside with husband while his sister was in town. Plenty of misters. Only got the chance to try  cocktails and appetizers here, but everything was fantastic. Food came out quick and they were busy. Can't wait to go back for brunch!",

(even with one girl sick from the night before :P)  Great brunch menu, affordable prices, great service w/ hot waiter ;), great location in the mall & close to the W hotel where we stayed, awesome outdoor seating area w/ misters.. basically sums up this place.  Came here for brunch on a Saturday, we had reservations and were seated right away.  It's a fairly big restaurant (reminded me of cheesecake factory), good for big groups, but saw lots of couples as well.. it looks like they have some private rooms towards the back which look pretty cool.  We would've gone for the mimosas, but were hungover from the night before.  Otherwise, this place serves solid brunch food.  Really good bread, HUGE portions.  I recommend the eggs benedict.  Bride got the S'MORES CHOCOLATE LATTE - WOWSERS!  that's one huge special cup of coffee.  My only complaint is that the food came out a bit cold.  Would return!",

    "text": "Olive and Ivy gets four stars for decor, atmosphere, location and overall food. But for me, I wouldn't say Olive and Ivy has the best food in Scottsdale for the price. I been here three times, and tried appetizers, entrees and desserts.   Let's talk about the wine menu, it is expansive with various wines avialable by the bottle or glass. Also O & I does have a specialty drink menu. I think the chopped chicken salad is better than the Meditteranean.. The bread they give you is light and served with a thick pesto sauce, and is very delicious.   The patio is great. As we get to the close of the fall, spring and winter season, heading into summer, get out on that patio asap. It is on the Scottsdale Waterfront, and they have misters and nice patio decor. Very relaxing, \"upscale\" feeling place.  Also, they do have a small market, with food available to go, made-to-order and wine  available. I might check that out for lunch one day. I'm always tempted to raid the market before I go home, but I haven't yet.  One thing that jades my experience evertyime I've been to O & I is the hostesses. They usually have a weird attitude, and it seems like they are doing you a favor by seating you.  Waiters/Waitresses are always great, and I love their style!   This is a great place to take family or go on a special day.",

Tasty flat bread pizza... The asparagus/shroom combo was fine, but you must like a pronounced shroom flavor.  The Mediterranean salad was a nice balance of color, flavor, and texture.",

We had a res outside and when they went to seat us, someone had mistakenly sat at our seats so we had to stand around and wait less than 5 min.  Shared the sangria to start.  We then had small portions of both the beet and mediterranean salad.  Both were excellent.  I had the mushroom tortellini and my friend a seafood dish - scallops maybe?  The food was all amazing and Robert, our server, was a sweetheart.  We then asked where we could find some fruit to buy to eat before our hike in the morning.  They actually brought us a bag of fruit on them because we had to wait a few minutes for our table, after already getting a sincere apology. Awesome place!",

And a possible 3rd: good wine list.  The bad things far outweigh these.  We went with a group of 10 friends on a Tuesday night.  First of all, I was not impressed with the menu.  It was expensive and I could hardly find a few things I actually wanted to order.  I ended up ordering the fig and prosciutto flatbread because I had to leave earlier than the rest of our group.  The service was TERRIBLE.  45 minutes went by before my food arrived.  For flatbread!  I had 10 minutes to scarf it down before I had to leave.  I have no idea why the service to a group of 10 could be so terrible on a Tuesday night.  I could understand if it was busy, but it was just poor service.  Turns out the flatbread was mediocre...I didn't even take my leftovers.  Would I return?  Maybe to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine.  But definitely not for dinner.  Too many other good restaurants in Scottsdale that are worth the price.  Very disappointing for Fox Restaurants.",

Obviously, a great location and you can't beat a seat on the patio for happy hour, but it just wasn't great (and I'm a big Sam Fox fan!).  First, our waitress was a bit off - just off on timing, her explanations, a whole host of things, but she did do a good job keeping up with the pony keg of iced tea we all drank! The food was ehhh...decent. We started with the calamari (which I don't love so nothing held against O&I on that one... although the fried zucch's were a nice addition) and then I had the chopped chicken salad. It was good, but nothing to really get excited about and it had a strange peanut-brittle topping that seemed to be kind of out of place.   As for the rest of the guests, one sent his ravioli's back and got the same salad I had as he said the rav's were not good. The others (french dip sandwich, gnocchi and a flatbread) were all a bit underwhelmed.   I have been here many times before and have found it to be pretty inconsistent. I definitely prefer dinner to lunch , especially based on this last experience and again, it's pretty solid for happy hour especially with the awesome people watching...the weekly Cougar convention!  Ironically, I will be back tomorrow....wish me luck!",

The atmosphere is pretty cool - large bar up front, huge open patio and cool lanterns hanging over head. It's a bit deceiving if you enter through the dessert bar area because it looks like a little grocery store - it's definitely not.   The food tasted great and was presented nicely without being ridiculously pricey. I didn't have any ice cream, but it looked really tasty. The service was very good and the drinks were delish (try a raspberry mojito - mmm). We went in on a Friday night without reservations and had to wait a solid 1.5 hours - make reservations.   This is a great spot if you like to be surrounded by 30-something hipsters or older men and women trying to be hip. I liked that the tables weren't piled on top of each other, but it was still crowded. There was a pretty good vibe -- I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Scottsdale.",

When you first walk in you are impressed with the ambiance and the overall atmosphere, very cool. Love the open kitchen and waterfront patio. Our server, sorry could not remember her name, was very good, very attentive and was on top of things all night. For appetizers we ordered a plate of bruschetta and the Fritto Misto (calamari, shrimp, and zucchini). The bruschetta was very good but I am unsure as to why the Fritto Misto is even on the menu. I could literally go to any dive bar and get the same dish. Thats my bad for not knowing what Fritto Misto meant, had to look it up, but I like calamari and shrimp so I ordered it. So on to entrees, two people ordered the sea bass, one salmon, one spicy shrimp risotto and I ordered the sea scallops. Everybody loved their entrees including myself. Scallops weren't grainy at all and matched with the polenta it was a very solid dish. We all ordered desert and everybody loved their gelato and lemon cake. Overall Olive and Ivy is very good and I will be going back, just won't be ordering the dive bar appetizer.",

We asked how long the wait was it was a long time but she said you can go to the back patio and possibly get a seat.  We had never been there before so we asked is there a table available?  The rude girls response was \"we dont know\" since its first come we dont keep track of it for you.  you will have to see if there is one available.  We walked through and obviously there was no open table which the dumb B already knew.  Really bad vibe from this place.  Really rude staff.  Staff seems ultimately annoyed that you had the audacity to walk in and expect to eat there.  It was almost like \"is this really happening right now?\"   That was our first and last visit we walked out after the hostess was a big b and I was completely bummed because the restaurant is beautiful.

I understand it was busy for Sunday brunch and I'm very laid back and understand when it gets busy...things happen...I get it.  My girlfriend and I sat at the bar. (The bar tenders were both very friendly.) We waited 45 minutes to get our food and when it arrived the order wasn't correct.  My girlfriend ordered the vegetable scramble and it came out with a slice of unmelted provolone clumped on one side of her eggs. Apparently, they had keyed the order in incorrectly and asked us just before the food arrived about her order, so I suspect they threw the cheese on last minute to salvage the order.  The medium rare burger I ordered was well done. In hindsight, we should have said something, but we were starving by that point.",

If you can, try to sit outside; the view of the river is so pretty, and there are plenty of heat lamps if you're feeling cold. Shared a salad, flatbread, and a crostini which was more than enough food for two. The salad was awesome and the short rib flatbread was delicious. The ambiance outside is very serene and great for conversation.",

    "text": "Very cute restaurant in Scottsdale! My friend was visiting from LA and we decided to come here which was the perfect choice. We sat outside across the water on the cute couch/chairs.   We were there for happy hour and most things on their menu were 1/2 off. We started with three types of bruschetta: butternut squash w/goat cheese, prosciutto w/fig and mozzarella w/tomato jam. The bread was super fluffy and the  flavors were very good. I also ordered a glass of white wine which paired well  with my appetizers.   For my main dish I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread which was really good. The pesto was just right and I even had enough to take 1/2 of it to go. Overall, great restaurant and atmosphere. I will definitely be returning to try some of their dinner dishes!",

I took a friend out for her birthday & when I walked up to the desk to ask what the wait was she said the next available table was at 9:30! (Mind you it was 6:15) But we had the option to sit at the \"chefs table\" which ended up being really cool anyways.  Landiss was our server & he was great! He grabbed our stuff quickly & was really friendly. I love it when I can go to a place & the people act like they genuinely enjoy their job, & he did just that.  Food: Bread & pesto is killer. Non negotiable. For a starter I got the Artichoke Hearts which were tasty & well cooked. My entree was the Wild Mushroom pappardelle & that was really delicious. I wish there was maybe a little more cheese or sauce going on, but it was still good. I also liked that I was able to be a pain in the butt & get a couple Jameson Mules even though its not on the menu. :)  I enjoyed this place & it had a great atmosphere. Will definitely be back, but next time Ill make reservations.",

You go to Olive & Ivy of course!   Wow, the food is scrumptious and the atmosphere is so refreshing, clean and modern. As you walk into the entrance you will be cascaded with a very light mist of H2O. Oooh, dramatics honey. It's mainly because this is Arizona and the dry heat can get a bit irritating in the summer. So I think that's a nice gesture for businesses in this area. We walked up to hostess stand and let me tell you chile. All of the hostesses looked like Victoria Secret models. Wow. Just over the top beautiful, honey. Is this common at Olive & Ivy? Because if it is, please don't fire the hiring manager. Lol. Anyways, one of the Sports Illustrated lookalikes escorted us to the bar and we were greeted by one of the  bartenders that suggested I try the Mediterranean salad (a must order) with added shrimp. I also gulped down a few tasty cocktails. I can't remember the name of them :( but honestly you can't go wrong with any of the drinks you try at the bar.   My salad was fulfilling and flavorful the added shrimp big and juicy.   Breakfast is suppose to be really good here as well. I will have to try it out for myself.  This place is gold and I will be back.",

It's hard to find a cinnamon roll with the perfect balance and this one definitely has it! The hummus had awesome, bold flavors. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I have to say, it's one of the best I've ever had. My mom got the egg sandwich and that was just as good!  We'll definitely be coming back here again!

    "text": "BACKGROUND   My girlfriend and business partner recommended we meet at Olive & Ivy for lunch and drinks for our meeting.  Olive & Ivy is a little hard to find at first, as it is tucked away in the Waterfront Camelback and Scottsdale restaurants in the back and looks like a tiny cafe from the street.  Once you finally find parking, (the best place is to use the parking garage across the street), find the restaurant.   The entrance is pretty unassuming, but it has a super chic and very impressive layout and vibe when you walk in.  There is a central bar with little couches around for a bit more causal seating, as well as a formal dining room.   There is also a cute central wine cellar in the front which makes a great selection for the wine menu.   The lighting is very modern and edgy.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad with shrimp as our add protein and hummus appetizer plate to share. The food was terrific.  I ordered the grapefruit mohito which was delicious.  The only complaint was that we weren't served water after asking for it over and over before we were able to get even got one glass. I kept asking for water refills, but never got more.   I did get all the refills on all of the expensive grapefruit mohitos though.  There are many different menus, including: Market Menu Brunch Menu Lunch Menu Dinner Menu Dessert Menu Happy Hour Menu  If you want to check out the food selection ahead of time, the best idea is to go to their website. Or, just be pleasantly surprised when you get there!  Hours: Brunch: Sat/Sun 10am - 3pm Lunch: Mon - Fri 11am - 3pm Happy Hour: Mon - Fri 3pm - 6pm Dinner: Sun - Thur 5pm - 10pm Fri/Sat 5pm - 11pm  Market Opens 7am Breakfast: 7am - 3pm  For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOliveandIvyRestaurant.com&s=ba4aa1469873407518ab4467d2e733ee4257cd9d55c82505c29140ecb1c16e7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OliveandIvyRestaurant.com</a>   I 4/5 highly recommend Olive & Ivy!",

Usually they suggest great places, so maybe I'm missing the point, but really, I just don't crave this food.  I will say - the service is EXCELLENT.  I've never had a server I didn't like and they always try to make my experience great.  (I actually just added a star to my review because of that.)

The outside area has an awesome vibe, with plenty of shade, as well as misters and string lights, and good music.   As far as food, my husband and I shared a piccante flatbread and a chopped chicken salad. Both were delicious! The salad had granola in it, which sounds weird but actually added some good texture to it, and the flatbread overall was really satisfying. The complimentary pesto and bread was super yummy too! Everyone in our party raved about the food.   My only complaint was that service was pretty slow. Drinks took a really long time and were all given to the wrong people when they did come out, and the bread didn't come out until our orders did. Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, so we were able to just chill and enjoy ourselves, but it was surprising since the restaurant didn't seem overly busy at that time.",

Of course due to all of the activity we were very parched. We ended up at Olive & Ivy. We were greeted with a smile and seated shortly thereafter. It was a busy late afternoon on a Saturday but they were able to accommodate us on the patio. We ordered drinks and a few flatbreads with a salad to share us. The drinks came out quickly and were very thirst quenching. Our friends had white wine, my husband a beer and I the Grapefruit Mojito which was outstanding. The Braised Short Rib flabread and Pesto Chicken flatbread were a hit but I really enjoyed the Chopped Chicken Salad. We had a very pleasurable experience and would highly recommend to anyone. The only crappy thing  (literally) was that my husband was between the umbrellas and there are a lot of trees/birds. Unfortunately he was bombed twice but he was a good sport and allowed us to laugh at his expense.  I was smart and sat under the umbrella. LOL We mentioned it jokingly to our waitress in passing which we honestly wasn't  expecting anything to be done about it . However the manager came out shortly thereafter and profusely apologized. We weren't complaining about the incident to receive anything in return but they took off my husbands drink as a courtesy. It is so nice to know that there are places out there that employ individuals that really care about service. I truly appreciate  the care not only our waitress  took but management to approach our table to apologize.  Great Job!  Needless to say we will enjoy the patio again but my husband and I will probably compete with sitting under the umbrella for protection.",

O&I has mimosa specials, but not bottomless like some of the other spots in town, and I'm guessing that's how our group of 6 didn't have to wait for a table at 11am on a Sunday.   I was in a breakfasty kind of mood and after MUCH debate, I decided upon their buttermilk pancakes which came topped with caramelized bananas and sliced almonds. The bananas and caramel were so good, I didn't even need the syrup on them... I used it on my breakfast potatoes instead!  hehe ... I ate every last morsel of my food, drank my specialty cocktail (something with gin and grapefruit juice, yum) and all for $25 including tip.  All in all, O&I is a solid joint. It's not overly crowded and is a nice spot to catch up with friends on the patio or enjoy drinks with your special someone.  Note: O&I does have a happy hour, but I have not yet taken advantage of it. I'll put that on my list!",

For entrees, I got the margherita flatbread and my husband got the chicken.  Both were really delicious and flavorful.  Our favorite was the foccacia and pesto that we got with our meal, and it was soooooo good!  I want that pesto recipe!  We also got a few cocktails to go with our meal, which were well-priced for the size of the glass.  Next time, we'll save room for dessert because the gelatos looked great!

It's a newer, larger-size restaurant, and kind of reminded me of something one might find here in the Bay Area - high ceilings, large open-air windows, well-dressed (yet casual) people, large bar, patio, animated conversations, etc. I liked the ambience - it wasn't too crowded, yet not deserted, either!  There was actually no wait, we were seated outdoors, and our server promptly took our drink order and also, served up some bread.  I opted for the Seared Ahi Tuna Salad - ($15) Mizuna Greens, Fresh Avocado, Mushrooms, Soy Caramel  ...extra avocado, of course!  The food was good, and my salad tasted really fresh - even the  tuna. I was not disappointed at all.   ...however, what I *was* disappointed in was the service. The food came out slowly, and after it was delivered, the server disappeared, and it was quite the effort for us to flag her down for drinks, etc. We were in a slight hurry, yet it was difficult to try to catch her for the bill.  After we finished eating, it was a good 20-minute wait before we took off. Had it not been for this point, I prob would've given this place four stars!",

We didn't have a reservation, so we made our way to the bar for a glass of wine. The hostess texted us when our table became available, which was a large comfy booth clad in a beautifully patterned fabric. Our waiter was engaging and attentive, and the food was superb. The people watching is added bonus, there were lots of interesting sleeve tattoos on the staff, and tables of rich blonde debutantes.I noticed a couple of metrosexual guys at the bar with Restalyn injections and nose jobs (which is a pretty common sight in Scottsdale).  Anyway about the food, we started with the hummus and veggies which was obviously house made and delicious. My entree was the Pacific sea bass, which, as the waiter explained, is substituted with a cousin to sea bass that is not endangered but just as tasty. The braised cauliflower was great, and the portion was perfect. The preserved grapefruit was the perfect touch, the dish needed no augmentation. My partner had the scallops which were amazing, and our relatives had the filet and added a small side of shrimp to make it a surf and turf, they loved it. We shared a lemon tres leches cake with berries for dessert that was mouth watering. The place is always packed and it's easy to see why. Beautiful ambiance and terrific food!",

I love the arugula salad that comes under the dates.  They also give you bread and olive oil pesto dip.  That's a meal in itself.  We ordered the chicken chopped salad which was delicious!  We told the waiter that all four of us were going to share so he brought it out already divided in four bowls.  We also had the margarita flat bread and the sweet potato cannelloni that was to die for!  We also ordered the cheeseburger that was cut into four as well.

You're able to sit anywhere you chose, grab a number, and they will bring your breakfast to you.  They have a small menu selection.  I went w/ the smoked salmon platter, it's a classic & you can't really go wrong.  I also had the yogurt parfait - it was really good.  All the berries in there were fresh and in season.    For dinner, I enjoyed the calamari appetizer, duck & spinach ravioli, and sangria.  The calamari was pretty oily - it would've been nice to have a piece of paper at the bottom of the serving platter.  The ravioli was good, and the bite of sea bass that I had was good too.   Surprisingly the dessert didn't catch my eye.  But the server was great.    On a last note I set up a group private dining event a couple of years ago and they absolutely enjoyed it and I want to say there's a private outdoor area as well attached to the PDR.  My group had nothing but rave reviews.    All in all it gets 5 stars for the ambiance with the seating outside by the river, and great service.",

    "text": "Awesome atmosphere. When I went to Olive and Ivy, we just had drinks, however from what I understand, all of the Fox restaurants have excellent food.  I really liked the outdoor seating - right next to the Canal. Nice way to spend a Friday evening having drinks on the patio. And if I remember, they had very reasonable prices. Parking is not too bad, you'll probably end up parking at the garage next to Nordstrom.",

You have to go for lunch don't go to dinner because the seen is kind of the same and the lunch menus food tastes a lot better during lunch.  I have not been there in a while but when I went I got grilled lemon chicken with hummus and it was so tasty.  The market place is pretty good, I have only walked through it but saw they had some really good looking stuff to bring home or eat on the go.  Recommendation: to the people at the mall who want to have a nice lunch and enjoy a cocktail, but not for dinner.",

Made reservations for 6:15 on a Thursday and arrived early-- no problem. It did become more crowded quickly.we sat outside on a very pleasant large patio. Service was great. Menu was not huge but food was very good. Especially notable was the Mediterranean salad and the sweet potato cannelloni. Cannelloni was rich and unique. Though my hubby thought it was too sweet. He had mushroom flatbread he thought was awesome. Two in our party had great filling lasagna. We had gelato and brown butter almond cake for dessert. All five in our party gave this place high reviews.",

    "text": "While my buddy Mike Z. was in town, we hit a few high spots...by which I could mean that we were high when we hit them...so munchies:)  But, no...my drug of choice is KetelOne or Bunnahabhain these days:)  One of the high spots was the fabulous Scottsdale Waterfront and Olive and Ivy:)  Of all the things that you can say about the Scottsdale Waterfront the most accurate is that it is, indeed, on the water:)  I grew up in the northwest and then lived in San Francisco for many years...I've dined overlooking the Mighty Columbia, the Mighty Pacific, The Mighty Willamette.  While traveling, I've managed to sup while overlooking the Mighty North Sea, the Mighty Atlantic and the Mighty Mississippi.  I'm probably not a good one to ask about the waterfront appeal of the Mighty Arizona Canal:)  Never the less, Olive and Ivy is a nice enough place:)  It's another Fox Concept (don't you just love the branding and labeling of these kinds of things:)  I suppose it would just be too darn simple to just say \"Hey, look!...Sam Fox just opened a new place!:)...Yay!\"...or something like that...no, it's a \"concept\"...and if you know me at all (and most of you don't) you know that restaurant nomenclature is nearly a complete mystery to me.  Fox Concept is no exception (oh, I get the \"Olive and Ivy\"...it's sort of Mediterranean, with a what...California overbite?:)...is that a concept?  I any event, The Beautiful Carin, Mike and I strolled over for cocktails and dinner, stayed for desert, sat out on the patio (which is very pleasant, BTW:)  And we enjoyed ourselves!  Well, why not...it was an enjoyable evening...pleasant atmosphere... the service was very good (I sometimes wonder if my reputation as a stupid good tipper is being spread around town...I seem to get great service even in places that don't really have a reputation for good service...I don't know...maybe it's just a coincidence:)  At any rate...the concept was hoppin'!:-)  Ton's of terrific people watching...people dining, people strolling along the Mighty Arizona Canal, people doing the hook up dance in the bar...dinner and a show...what a concept! :-)  We each had a couple of marti's (oh, the joys of being able to walk to dinner!:)  We started with a hummus something appetizer and antipasti...The Beautiful Carin and I split a perfectly serviceable Caesar salad and I had a nice risotto, while Carin ordered her standby...roasted chicken (I wish I could remember what Mikey ordered, but I was too busy with my marti's, chit chat and what not:)  After dinner, desert seemed like a reasonable idea:)  Mike and I each had a Porto, while we all shared something chocolate and another something kind of cinnamon and orange...  It was all pretty good, not the best risotto, but good...actually, not the best anything, but still good...all pretty well executed (if not truly inspired)  If Fox's Concept is separating me from my money on a fairly regular basis, then I guess it's a successful concept:)",

If you are looking for a restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale with a big patio area for a large group, this is your place. We are going to be utilizing one of their dining rooms and part of their patio for our private dinner.   In regards to my previous experiences, service has always been exceptional. From the hostess, to the manager, server and events manager - everyone has been helpful and very nice.  Food: At our last visit, we decided to do a tasting of our own. Our favorite appetizer was the lamb meatballs. I enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates but my fiance and his mom thought they were just okay. The bruschetta recommendation from our server had manchego cheese and chorizo - delish! We also filled up on the complimentary foccacia bread and pesto dipping sauce so when it came to the main entree, we decided to split the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin since it was 3 medallions - perfect for the 3 of us.  Drinks: We had a variety of drinks. The one that stood out the most were our dessert cocktails - the espresso martini. It is probably the best espresso martini I have ever had! Definitely looking forward to have more of those!",

You seriously have to dine outside if the weather is warm (which is pretty much always is)! We were seated promptly outside and right next to a beautiful little fountain. The sound of the water running was so calming with the warm sun and slight breeze. It's a blissful oasis amongst busy Scottsdale traffic! Our waiter greeted us and brought delicious house made bread to start things off - it is amazing!! My friend and I ordered, both of us having severe allergies to different foods and were delighted to see the ease at which the waiter ensured that nothing we ordered would cause us any issues.   The food came and it was INCREDIBLE. I couldn't stop eating, I think we barely spoke over lunch. You can tell the freshness in each bite and the care that the kitchen puts in - not to mention that the food came out quickly! We ordered salads with protein but were very happy with how quickly it came out and how delicious they both were.   We will absolutely be back! This is a MUST if you're in Scottsdale and in need of a healthy but different lunch - the fusion menu is incredible and it will keep you coming back for more!",

They had tables open on the patio but nothing for inside for another hour and half. We decided to take the patio seating since they had misters outside.   The patio was actually quite cool, the building provided a good amount shade plus the umbrellas and misters kept things school. There was also a nice breeze that day that helped. Service was good the waitress checked up on a few times and kept our waters refilled. They also allowed us to bring in our outside drinks. We had stopped by a coffee shop before heading over. Their brunch menu consisted of lunch and breakfast items. I opted for the tuna salad sandwich, with apple, celery, baby greens on toasted wheat bread. Tuna salad was good it was not overly dressed with mayo. I chose a side of fries to go with it. We also had their lamb gyro with grilled pita. It was a little disappointing they used a lamb patty. We were expecting slices of lamb meat. The pita tasted more like a tortilla. The breakfast potatoes were good, the sausage patties were okay.   Overall the food was average nothing special. I did enjoy the patio, were surprised how cool it was for being outside. I was expecting a little since the reviews were so high but it just average.",

Grilled onions and roasted tomatoes are amazing and the pine nuts are a great touch!   Love going there to just hang out at the bar for a drink and flat bread. Service is always really great.

    "text": "Awkward Experience... I arrived for happy hour after exploring Fashion Square for most of the day. I liked the look of the happy hour loung  patio so I opted to sit there. New to this area and style of dining, I chose a table that had two ladies. They were about to leave and eagerly handed over their seats. I kicked back and lounged to make myself comfortable before I ordered a drink. The waitresses that weighted my section were incredible. There was a new and a senior waitress who took excellent care of me. Another man came and sat down at the table waiting for a guest. During the next hour if they engaged in conversation and I minded my business ordering a drink and happy hour appetizer-Salmon Lox Bruschetta (A+)!  I left my seat to go to the restroom and returned to find a different couple sitting where the previous two were. They also had a new server who explained her concern for seeing my purse and shopping bag still in the seat where I had only left to use the restroom. When I sat back down the new couple gave me the strangest looks and so did the server when she came over to take the couples order. I did not see my server again for about 20 minutes so I asked the new server if she would be able to take my dinner order. Although she acted like I did not exist at that table, also left me feeling that I did something wrong. I found myself wondering if I should have gotten up and found a different table or if I did something wrong in that situation, i'm still not sure of that answer. The tension was so strong after I placed my dinner order that I just asked for it to go. Eventually I saw my original server when she came over to tell me my food was being prepared to go.  I paid collected my food and my belongings and quietly left not to disturb the couple that was clearly on first date.  I still have zero idea if maybe there was a time limit on the happy hour seating or why I was being dismissed by the server and given strange looks by the new couple at the table. (?)  The food, drinks, ambiance and patio were amazing but the experience and the way I was treated by the new server made me feel awful.",

I was wrong. 45 minutes for a table for two however they do offer the same menu at the bar and the tables surrounding the bar if you're willing to settle. Easy parking underneath with an elevator and stairs. It's a giant footprint and has beautiful views on the patio where we sat. Both heaters were empty of propane which took about 20 minutes to get remedied.   Lacking in apps though and went with 2 pieces of the bruschetta. Both were good but nothing  extraordinary.   The menu does not match the ambiance. It's a wonderful place packed with the charm of retro/industrial shiek, globe lights, thick tall curtains and high ceilings. The menu on the other hand was unimpressive regardless of the fact that everything is made fresh daily.",

Sat down at the bar and had a great cocktail while waiting on our friends to arrive.  Bar staff was very attentive and friendly.   Once seated we ordered several appetizers bacon wrapped dates, lamb meat balls, calamari.   Dates were stuffed with sausage and had great flavors.  The lamb meat balls were dense but flavorful. The tzatziki sauce was excellent.  The fried calamari and shrimp was very good.   My wife ordered the shrimp scampi risotto, the risotto was cooked with a seafood stock which gave it a rich flavor.   I ordered the bone in ribeye with creamed spinach. Steak was cooked perfectly and the creamed spinach was extra cheesy which gave them a salty flavor that paired with the sweet sauce on the steak.   Overall great place and great food.",

Our server was not only friendly but on top of drink refills and getting our food to us at a very quick-pace considering our table of 5 came in at a busy hour on a Sunday evening.   It's obvious the amount of work and love put into the one-of-a kind meals prepared at Olive & Ivy and that the employees enjoy what they do. Not to mention the perfect ambiance.

The ambience was nice but it seemed that every table was in close proximity to a door to the back patio so it got cold with the servers coming in and out.    The food was good- not spectacular- but good.  My friends had the scallops, the lasagna, and the pappardalle.  They liked all of them but none were memorable.  I'm vegetarian and I really wanted a salad with more vegetables than what was offered.  They were very accommodating and created a veggie heavy salad for me which was great.  The complimentary bread and pesto were great and our server refilled it once for us as well.  It was my friend's birthday so they comped us a peanut butter mousse dessert and we also ordered the lemon cake.  Both were good but we probably wouldn't order either again.  Definitely a cute spot for a date night or girls' night.  It is loud and hard to hear though so be prepared to yell in conversation.",

It's like a Madeira chicken but only lightly sauced and lightly breaded which is perfect, not too heavy. It's hard to find a good chicken dish that's not dry and doesn't have sketchy chicken pieces but this one was perfect!! It has two thin chicken breasts and has lots of delicious veggies in it, highly recommend. My dad got the bone in ribeye and really liked it!! Plus if you sign up for their e-club you can get $10 off of your meal of $20 or more. Great atmosphere, amazing location, great food and really awesome service from our super attentive server! (I will edit if I can find my receipt with his name on it!) Our server recommended the Chicken Scallopini and I'm SO glad he did.

My colleague and I stumbled upon this place randomly and was rather impressed by the great service and food.  The bruschetta was amazing! The shrimp risotto to die for, and steak wonderful as well.  The ambiance, like a beautiful picture. The only problem we encountered that was quickly fixed was my colleague's steak was requested medium well. As he approach the center it became a bit on the rare side. But management took care of it right away and put it back on the grill, and it was cooked to perfection.  Will definitely be back the next time I find myself in Scottsdale.",

I personally think they have a better lunch menu than dinner menu but you can just decide that for yourself. The turkey grinder and chicken panini are my favorite. On weekends get a drink from their brunch menu.",

The lasagna my husband ordered was good but my scallops were better. Do your self a favor, order them! Also the burnt honey ice cream was crazy good.",

So this last time we were just there this past Saturday night for dinner and I can say I was server John was perfect. Because I am vegan vegetarian there was nothing on the menu that I could have eaten so he suggested a alternative dinner option and I got the Catalonia(sp). It was very very tasty and for dessert I had the sorbet. Everyone said the food was OK however the choices for dinner could have been much better. Everyone came to the consensus that the brunch menu is way better than that dinner menu. I just wish that the restaurant would be able to have better options for groups of parties I understand it's easier to have one menu or two menus but if I am going to be paying 50 or $60 I think the food choices and the servings should be just a little bit better tasting.   All in all I will be back but not for dinner most likely just back for brunch!",

Great conversations with others who were waiting and a fun server named Nikki.  When I told her I was the designated driver for the evening she winked at my wife and said...\"Well someone has to be in charge\"...and then high fived my wife and said...\"and someone has to be in charge of having fun!\" We were shown to our table at exactly our reservation time and were greeted by John.  He had a wonderful sense of humour as we joked about the weather and how so many people end up in Arizona.  He was attentive and made a great recommendation on a wine pairing for my wife. There was no rush and our little table by the canal was a perfect place to spend the evening. We will be back!",

I don't usually write reviews (see all of the one review I've written previously), but the service tonight justified the effort. Brandon was, without a doubt, worth the time put into this. He recommended great options, and answered all of our questions thoughtfully and thoroughly. We were incredibly indecisive on wine, and he made great suggestions - in several different price ranges. He was even quite patient waiting for us to make our final decisions in both wine and food.  Bruschetta was yummy, as always, and the scallops were tender and delicious. Finished off with the (well recommended) blood orange sorbet.   What a wonderful night, and thank you to Brandon for making it so.",

The ambiance is a bit dark inside, and slightly noisy, but very warmly decorated with a great atmosphere to it. Outdoor seating is a must as long as it has cooled some, which it had. It was just perfect. The patio is decorated very lovely, cozy, and it's spacious, great for groups, and there are misters.  A must try are: The prosciutto and fig appetizer The sea bass entree, light and creamy  The salmon, cooked perfectly and seasoned with this delicious honey like glaze and beats, yum! I was five seconds away from ordering a second salmon entree it was just that great The desserts, amazing! A must try: The toasted coconut cakes with mint chocolate chip ice cream Their blackberry balsamic ice cream amazing! All fish made.  If you come to Scottsdale you cannot leave without stopping by for dinner. Trust me it's a winner!",

You can see the European influence, but also the laid back, sitting on a good friends vineyard patio where beyond the trees is rolling hills, orchards and elegant rural life. All this and only steps away from the lavish Scottsdale Mall! The menu is well thought out and a certain amount of effort was clearly put into the bruschetta list's 6 tempting creations: All refined and elegant in their execution and piled high with toppings. The bruschetta sell for $4-$5 each, or 3 for $11 - A hell of a deal! And be sure to try the Manchego with quince & Spanish chorizo, aaah-mazing!   The other wonderfully yummy price point find is the single scoop of in-house made sorbets and gelatos, $1.75 for a single scoop! I had the lemon butter cream and it was divine. Rich, creamy, with a lovely lemon finish.   The wine list is thorough and poignant. There are not 6 different Chardonnays and 4 Sauv blancs. But approximately 9 whites and 12 reds by the glass with only 1 selection of each type of grape: One fabulous vintage for all occasions! I really adore this concept.   The restaurant is inviting and as large as the desert that surrounds this city. My server was outstanding, you rock Lauren!",

I could not hear a word the table server was saying about the menu, and I could not see the menu without a small torch lamp .  What I could read on the menu were not meals , but , rather , experiments in fusions of various traditional world foods.  Good if your into tapas type dining.

I cannot believe he didn't come to let us know before. So while we ate she sat and watched. When she then decided to order a muffin and asked what kind they had, he read off the list. She told him which one she wanted and he came back 5 minutes later telling her they were out of those too. NEVER AGAIN WILL WE GO BACK.

It's definitely one of my favorite Fox Restaurants, and the Scottsdale location is right on the Waterfront in Old Town.   If you're visiting, it's great in the summer or winter, but especially good when you can dine outside. You can also walk from Olive & Ivy to the rest of Old Town, without having to take another cab.  My recommendations include:  -bacon wrapped dates - just phenomenal here! -bruschetta - lots of options, and some claim that they're the best in town. I like the fig & prosciutto.  -scallops - creamed corn and bacon gastrique? So good! -the filet - I haven't had this yet, but my co-workers said it was the best filet that they've had in AZ. At $39, it's not cheap, but these guys know steak and were thoroughly impressed!  Visited September 2015",

We could have saved a few $$ if we had just done that, but honestly the food was so good I didn't feel bad paying more.   Bread was brought to our table and served with a pesto dipping sauce - I ate the remainder of the sauce with my hands it was so good.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad and piccante flatbread. I also ordered a red sangria - which was different from normal sangria since it had crushed berries it it - but it was one of the best sangrias I've ever had. The salad and flatbread were delicious. The salad was big and worth the price - flatbread was good but maybe a better deal on the happy hour menu since it was smaller than expected.   The food was the perfect portion so we still had room for dessert. We decided on the coconut cakes with blood orange sorbet. This is probably gross but I honestly did not want to swallow my cake - I kept it in my mouth like a fine red wine and savored every last piece.   This restaurant needs to come to Chicago - I would be all over it like white on rice.",

It's started with an off menu personal creation of his own, which you have to ask him about if you have the pleasure of his service. It was one heck of a recommendation that I'd gladly wheel my grandmother to the side to enjoy again. Also, I assume he has some sort of magic crystal ball in his pocket because his timing was impeccable. The entire experience was effortlessly enjoyable.

There were multi colored hunks of tomato (which were superbly fresh and flavorful), chunks of avocado, big thick wedges of lettuce, and 2 bacon strips placed on top.  lol.  It was all amazingly fresh and tasty, but it was just funny.  It looked like they had forgotten to chop everything up and put it into a salad. I still loved it.  My friend's potatoe-y soup (cannot remember what it actually was) tasted flavorful and hearty.  All the bruschettas and breads with pesto were out of this world.  Great wines.  AND THEN.  $1.75 humongous cups of gelato.  With 3 flavors all tucked in there. And a shortbread cookie that made me weep tears of joy.  Seriously.  You can't even get the same amount of crappy froyo for $1.75.  Go eat the gelato.  Especially the PB&J flavor!!! AAAAHHH!!! SO TASTY!!!!",

I've eaten just about everything and if not me, the people I've recommended to come, have, all saying that this place has great food for the price. I love the sweet potato cannelloni with spinach and mushrooms. It's so different but so so tasty.

We went in to take advantage of their happy hour (if you don't the prices seem wayyyy to steep for me). Anyway, if you take advantage of their happy hour you must sit either in the outside patio or the lounge. Now the outdoor patio was beautiful! Prettiest outdoor seating I have seen ever. But not when it is 104 out. (and there are no misters). Why did we sit outside do you ask? Because the bar area (which is tiny) filled up super fast (duh. its yummy!) The indoor ambiance is beautiful. (a little dark) The most awesome lights ever are in there. The service was good and the location is nice (right next to the free parking too!)  I tried the featured white wine, and whatever it was (sorry I forgot) was good! My friend tried the sangria, but I was not a fan. Weird flavor compared to most sangrias that I can't describe.   Now onto the food. People who raved about the flatbread pizzas...I have no idea what you are talking about.  I had the margharita and it was just not good. Soggy and flavorless. The hummus was very yummy. Needed more pita with it. Now onto the star of the show: the bruschetta. The vine ripe tomato is yummy. The apple caponata is just as yummier, and the prosciutto and fig was also excellent! Ohhhh so yummy! This is the place to get bruscetta and wine after a long day.",

    "text": "Been here a few times now and while I have never been overly impressed I have always been satisfied. Came recently with my family for breakfast/brunch and got the eggs benedict (my favorite breakfast). The eggs came out perfectly cooked with just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. The flavors were good if not spectacular. I did really enjoy the potatoes as they were a bit more flavorful then normal breakfast potatoes.   I also had a bloody mary (little hair of the dog from the previous night). It was not as spicy as i liked but well flavored and had plenty of vodka to do the trick.  If you are looking for something in the area stop by and try it out. Like I said you won't be blown away but odds are you won't be let down either. Also sit on the patio if you can it's pretty nice out there.",

    "text": "I came here last Saturday night with my family and I'm not sure what we were thinking but we didn't try to make a reservation until 2:00pm. That left us with 2 options- 5:15 and 9:15. Neither were appealing, but I really wanted to try this restaurant, so we went with the 5:15 sitting. It certainly felt strange eating that early, but I quickly got over that once I started to taste the food.  The first problem I had with this restaurant was that everything looked so good. My family and I must have spent a good 10 minutes optimizing our order. We coordinated a strategic attack on the menu making sure that we got to try at least one thing form every part of the menu.  We started with a Bruschetta and the Pesto Flatbread. The bruschetta was alright, a little small in terms of portions but our waiter did try to tell us. It was the Pesto Flatbread was what everyone at our table fought over. It was much larger than the bruschetta and had the creamiest, most delicious goat cheese on top.   We then had a mixture of salads and entrees. I wasn't feeling all that hungry (remember- it was 5:15) so I just got a simple green salad. Let me tell you for $5 that was a pretty reasonable sized salad and their simple vinaigrette was very flavorful.  My family members were all very happy with their dishes as well (sweet potato cannelloni, big eyed tuna, and the natural chicken), but the real winner of the evening was the Sangria.  We ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria (tempranillo, cassis, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry) to start with and even considered ordering more. It had a lovely sweetness to it that came from the fruits and it was very addicting. I will definitely be ordering that again.  I can definitely see myself coming here again and trying their other salads and their white sangria too.",

Thankfully Ryan is an intelligent guy and helped guide us through our meal as we were a little overwhelmed by all the choices. We ordered the Irish Blood & Honey and the Belvedere Blue to drink. Fritto Misto and bruschetta to start, followed by scallops and sea bass entrees. We were blown away by everything we ate, especially the seafood dishes. The depth of flavor was awesome. Ryan stopped to chat about our meals and told us how much he loves working in a from-scratch restaurant. We finished with the tres leches cake and left stuffed and amazed. 5 stars for decor, food, and amazing service. We are so excited to come back, and we'll request Ryan when we do.",

Apparently I just need to request a certain amount of focaccia, though I truly don't need more than one piece (maybe they were just trying to prevent me from binge eating? If so, you guys are very thoughtful). I do know that in the past they were much more generous with their servings, so I was kind of hoping they would assume if I'm ordering it, that I definitely would love as much as possible ;-)   I realize I sound like a lunatic ranting about this, but just think of this bread and pesto as a drug (because it's truly addictive) and I clearly need my fix...haha  Moral of the story: their bread and pesto is so good that some people will actually freak out if they aren't given more than one serving :-) (or maybe that's just me...)",

The thin sliced, salty prosciutto, slightly sweet pop of dog and peppery arugula combine for extraordinary flavor. When I ordered the kale salad for an appetizer my server suggested a 1/2 size - perfect!   The Chenin Blanc is a must try. The forward flavor is a bit sweeter than I normally like but the finish is a bit spicy. Lovely!  For dinner I ordered the natural chicken. Chicken thigh is on point. Potatoes are creamy as advertised. The mushrooms give the citrus jus an umami essence. It's maybe a touch sweet. Just a touch.   Sadly, I'm going to have to pass on dessert. Next time.   I know I sound picky but the large screen with football ruins the mood every time I look over. It's the only reason I've given the place 4 stars instead of 5.",

    "text": "I note with interest that Olive and Ivy appears to advertise on Yelp, and also that numerous negative reviews have been buried by Yelp in the \"Not Recommended\" section.  Coincidence?  Who knows.  We'll see where this review ends up...  In short, this restaurant's location is terrific--in a vibrant spot on the Scottsdale waterfront, perfect for strolling and window-shopping before or after dinner.  Food is so-so.  Restaurant is very loud.  Service is horrible: we were seated at 6:30 and when I finally left at 8:45 my entree had not yet been served.  On a related note, the valet service doesn't use paper check tickets, they use an app which requires you to provide your cell phone number to them, and which appears to slow them down considerably because it's difficult for them to use.  Retrieving my car took about 15 minutes even though there was only one person ahead of me.",

I started off with two Moscow Mules and they were reallllll good.  Liked that they put in a little more lime.  The dinner was great and everyone had something different.  I had the chicken scaloppini and it hit the spot.    They let us bring in our own cupcakes, ya know this dude has a sweet tooth. Really enjoyed our experience and I dunno about you, but I'm coming back!",

Megan knew what was in each of the dishes and was able to make great recommendations for me, and they subbed out a vegetable I can't eat and exchanged it for some I can eat. I got the salmon and it was the best I've ever had. The rest of my party got the hummus, lamb meatballs and pesto with bread for appetizers, and flat bread, kale salad, the Mediterranean salad with shrimp and Mediterranean salad with salmon. Everyone loved their food. I would highly recommend this restaurant, and get Megan if you can. Fabulous food and amazing service!",

That was actually very pleasant to watch the food prep, but it was surprising that all the tables were booked for the next 1.5 hours when the space is large and the patio is huge! Also, it meant having to sit on high stools with very difficult to reach hooks underneath the counter for our purses.  Decor is gorgeous - high ceilings, Edison lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling, candles, huge glass walls looking onto the patio & canal... Very romantic and chill.  Our server was very friendly and pleasant. We had asparagus bruschetta, bacon wrapped dates, the sweet potato cannelloni, and tried both sangrias. All tasty. Had toasted coconut and white chocolate raspberry gelato for dessert. Food was good quality, focaccia & pesto were great for setting the Mediterranean/California vibe.  The general manager even came to check on us and we enjoyed chatting with her. Lots of friendly people in a beautiful relaxing place with tasty food. Exactly what we were looking for (minus the high stools) on our vacation!",

Great atmosphere, delicious food, I have tried many items from their menu and all were delicious. See information below: Bruschetta appetizers- Asparagus, Prosciutto, Manchego- all were delicious Bacon Wrapped Dates- little too sweet for my taste, but for a person who loves sweets, this would be perfect Margherita flatbread- it was okay, nothing to brag about Wild Mushroom Pappardelle Pasta- for all mushroom lovers, it had beautiful earthy flavor, loved every bite of it, and leftovers are delicious too!! Sea Scallops*- a light dinner dish, scallops were perfectly done, not overcooked.  Chicken Scallopini- this was amazing, not too strong on the spices but chicken was nice and tender Natural Chicken- another beautiful chicken dish, perfectly done.  Flavors of all dishes are great and different. Their customer service is always amazing and they are very attentive to your needs. Their cocktails are more on the sweeter side so i preferred to stick with either beer or wine and they have great selection as well.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant can be little too loud if you are planning to talk a lot more with your girlfriend, their outdoor seating area would be a better choice and with the perfect weather and temperature, it is pretty nice.  Taking one star away, as they are little pricey with their menu but the quantity of main dishes is more on the smaller side.But that is definitely not going to stop me from going there again or recommending this wonderful restaurant to my friends and family members.",

The booth we sat in possessed a warmth reminiscent of many upscale restaurants I have been to in Chicago.  Our server, Melinda, was one of the most attentive servers I have experienced. She even did something special for me (mint iced tea) that I will be permanently ordering each time.  The Bruschetta were all delightful with the strawberry being my fave. All flavors were light and enjoyable on the tongue.",

We decided to give Olive & Ivy another chance and tried out their Brunch today without telling them.  The hostess station greeted us and arranged to seat us without any delay.  Good so far.   Tony, our waiter, arrived thereafter and introduced himself asking if we had been here before, sharing the soup of the day and answering our menu questions.  Again, good so far, but it only got better.  Tony took our orders and returned with fresh bread and pesto sauce on the side.  We ordered.  My Eggs Benedict were not only superb but the Coffee Mocha was excellent!!  My wife enjoyed her eggs, bacon, and potatoes as well.  Tony continued to check on us.  Here's what I learned as I looked around.  The service and food should not only be \"good\", but it looked as if \"excellent\" was the expectation, the bar.  People were happy, the different food looked great - and the wait staff was very attentive.  We have become fans.  Thank you to Tony and the management.",

This place is gorgeous.  The bar is a great place for happy hour after work or to meet up with friends before a night out...and the restaurant itself offers AMAZING table side mimosas and brunch on the weekends. Delish.

    "text": "Sure, the food at Olive & Ivy is good, but there are plently of places, even Fox RC places, that I have been to that are better.   Whenever I go to Olive & Ivy, I feel that the service is a little snooty, even from the point where you walk in the door. I always seem to be greeted by a somewhat inconsiderate hostess, and the servers to be honest really aren't that much better. You can tell that they are completely fake when they come to take your oders/bring you food, because they're scrounging for a good tip, which they expect from this restaurant's normal clientele-- the well-off businesspeople out to lunch or the Scottsdale moms that congregate to go out to brunch.   The food, like i mentioned, is decent. I almost always get their Mediterranean Salad with some grilled salmon on top. It's usually pretty decent, but definitely overpriced. You get about 1 1/2 standard measuring-cup cups of mixed greens, some cous-cous and other fillers, with about a 3-ounce portion of salmon all for around $21. And that's just for the salad, not including drinks.   Just about the only thing that keeps Olive & Ivy from getting a two-star review is their delicious pesto and bread that they serve (upon request) before you get your meal. It's honestly really delicious, light, and the pesto isn't too garlicy or salty. It is on the smaller side, so make sure you ration it properly between yourself and any of the other guests who you're dining with.   3 stars for:   Pros:  Decent food   Cons:  Bleh service Small portions Overpriced   Bottom Line: Yeah, i'll be back, as long as I'm not the one footing the bill.",

One of the coolest things about this place is that you can pick an open seat in front--no waiting, sink into their soft leather chairs--and people watch.      The food is prepared with such detail and care.  I ordered a vegetable cheese soup and it was perfectly seasoned.  My salad was fresh with a tangy oil and vinegar dressing...Wow! what a taste.  My companion had the fresh salmon.  Served over a bed of lettuce, the taste and presentation was just terrific!!    The breads served here really satisfy.  And the dipping sauce has just the right amount of garlic and spice to keep you nibbling throughout the meal.    But what makes the difference at this eatery is their unmatched service.  Everyone is friendly and professional.  The wait staff are trained like no other.  Ask them what is in the pesto sauce and the rattle off about 10 different ingredients.    What pleasure early weekend breakast is at this place.  You will not be disappointed!!",

Super rich and decadent -- one critique though is that there's so much filling and it's so thick that texturally, a bite was almost like the feeling when your mouth is full of peanut butter. The chicken scallopini had the most delicious sauce! My critique with that though was they take the time to get the panko crusted chicken breast so crunchy but the way it's plated on top of moist sauteed spinach and the sauce on top makes it all soggy and you loose most of the crunch. If it were played differently it could be better. Overall a great dinner experience though!",

The appetizers were mini pizza/bruschetta - some had mushrooms and some has tomatoes with cheese. Both were delicious. Another appetizer was a date wrapped in bacon - this was super delicious and easy to eat. I ordered a pineapple mojito and at first our server was confused, saying they don't have a blender but could make us a raspberry mojito. (I've had bartenders tell me they don't have blenders when I've ordered mojitos before, so I was used to this.) Luckily, our server came back later telling me she was confused and viola a delicious pineapple mojito was placed in my hands with a large slice of pineapple on the rim. It was amazing! So good, the husband had to order one for himself. Our party moved inside to a private room where we were given tiny menus with simple selections. The husband ordered the beef entree, steak with horseradish mashed potatoes and I ordered the scallops with corn polenta. While the scallops were delicious, the steak was super tender and moist! (Better than a fillet we had the night before!) For desert, I ordered the chocolate cake with coffee crema inside and the husband ordered the cheesecake. The cheesecake came in a cute mason jar and was amazing. I really liked my chocolate cake but the cheesecake was better. For once everything the husband ordered was better than what I had ordered! It was a fantastic party and such a great venue. Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "\"Mediterranean cuisine with a Californian flare.\" Well I think this is my first Yelp review, and for good reason, too!  The girlfriend and I just dined here on Valentine's Day (coincidentally the gf's birthday) and the whole experience was top notch. It all started when I called to make a reservation weeks ago and they asked if we were celebrating anything else so I mentioned the birthday and that was that. Made reservations for the beautiful patio on VDay.  Flashforward to the 14th and the experience was wonderful. Parking underground was super convenient - elevator brings you up right next to the restaurant. We were immediately seated right next to the Waterfront with a great view and phenomenal weather.  Now the food (finally, this guy got to the food): Disclaimer, the menu was a VDAY specific menu, so don't get too excited about what you read here because it might not be the usual! Cocktails were A+. I got a blood orange paloma (delicious compliments with the tequila) and the gf got a mojito, also delicious. Cocktail menu was very diverse and had interesting flavor pairings - wish I could have drank more if I wasn't driving the birthday girl around!  FOOD! We started with the hummus with vegetables appetizer. Delicious hummus, slight kick to it made it stand out compared to other bland hummuses. The pita and vegetable selection was also very fresh. For entrees, the gf got the chicken scallopini which had well-crusted (slightly crispy, not fried) chicken on top of some sauteed greens - fantastic. I got the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, cooked medium at the chef's recommendation. Also phenomenal but there was something special about the tangy/spicy BBQ sauce on top. Will definitely dream about this dish.  Now here's the special part, free dessert (twice baked chocolate cake, amazing) with a personal birthday message written in icing! I was so pleased they went to such care for us when they had hundreds of other couples trying to make their own VDay special.  Will definitely return.",

Pleasantly affordable, generously proportioned and delightfully flavored.

Until I found a beard hair cooked INTO the dough of my pizza. Our waiter visited before and to take our order, but we did not see him after that until our bill. Water was empty, and my food had hair in it and after waiting almost ten minutes for our server to come and check on us I got up and retreived another staff member. The manager did offer us new pizza but did not seem to sincere with his apology (most likely because we are a group of young individuals). I would liked to have seen it at least taken off of our bill because we did not get to eat together. It is not about the money, but more so the lack of judgment in the experience. I am very disappointed, I've had better care at a Red Lobster. I'm very sad to say that I do not want to dine here again, nor will I recommend it to any Scottsdale friends.",

The waitress, in describing the menu, made our mouths water. She was excellent in her descriptions. She helped us choose a wine for the table, offering a sample of a Pinot Noir, which we didn't like so much and then steering us to a great Cabernet Sauvignon.  The bruschetta sampler appetizer was perfect for our group of 5. The range of flavors offered was nice too, since we all had different tastes.  I had an entree of scallops which was perfectly prepared, perfectly sized and accompanied by sides that paired with it nicely.  Everyone in our group was very happy with their dinner and dessert. This is definitely the type of restaurant that could be a go-to destination. The service was first class, the food was tasty, and yet the open feel to the area kept it from being stuffy.",

    "text": "This is my ideal dining experience and favorite Fox restaurant, hands down. O&I is absolutely wonderful. Even after a scorching summer day, the patio offers a gorgeous tuscan ambiance with a canopy of well groomed trees, expertly placed misters, strung Edison bulbs, and an overall understated elegance. So dreamy.  That's all you really  need to know, but I'll humor you since you're reading reviews for a reason, hm?   Bruschetta sampler: Prosciutto/fig, Manchego/chorizo, Apple/Brie All of them were delicious, though the prosciutto one was hard to eat due to the meat not having been cut...the bread was cut into thirds prior to the meat being added so we had to remove all the arugula and cut the meat, then re-build the app. That was weird. But the flavor was A+  We drank the white wine sangria, which packs a punch thanks to the brandy, and the cactus blossom cocktail. Both were great on a warm summer evening.   Seabass: though I did enjoy it, I wouldn't order it again. It was well prepared but I prefer fish without the gray meat as it tastes a little gamey...Again, just my preference. The sides it came with were small, but good. The few pieces of \"caramelized\" cauliflower left something to be desired as it was closer to just roasted cauli, but the candied grapefruit and snap peas were perfect with the mild white fish.   Filet Mignon: served with horseradish potatoes & red wine shallots--stole the show, without a doubt. Nothing to complain about here. My husband ordered it rare, and it came out with a lovely charred crust and warm red center. Beautiful. Plate envy for sure.  Cheesecake w/ stewed peaches: Decadent and delicious, and certainly enough for two after all the food we'd already had.   Roll me out and valet the car, dear. I am deliriously happy.   PS - the bathrooms are rad.",

My mom and I ordered the avocado, mozzarella, and mushroom bruschettas. The mozzarella was my favorite out of the bunch. We also got the hummus appetizer which was good but kind of spicy. The braised short rib flatbread was the best part of the meal. Overall friendly service, lovely atmosphere, and great food. Definitely a must to visit in Scottsdale.",

The menu pleasantly surprises with items not commonly found. We are warmly welcomed and promptly seated in a high backed booth that allows for privacy. I've given 5 stars and here is why. I got the veal and spinach ravioli. It comes and the presentation is beautiful. Then I take a bite and it is cold. First in a restaurant of this caliber cold food should never leave the kitchen. But more importantly how the restaurant handles things when mistakes are made. And this is why despite getting cold food I am still giving 5 stars. The manager immediately apologized, told me they would not reheat it, but will remake the dish for me so it would be fresh. My dish comes back piping hot, beautifully presented, and the taste was worth amazing. And then the manager told me my meal was on the house. And that is exactly how this should have been handled. No excuses, make it right. And on top of this, when I made the reservation I had indicated it was our 40th Anniversary. The brought us an on the house dessert to share that was so beautifully presented, and again the taste was amazing. We will definitely be back.",

For dinner, my husband ordered the Mediterranean flat bread and I ordered the chicken scaloppini. I loved them both and would highly recommend them.   The place and the ambiance is so fabulous. It's an open kitchen which is so welcoming. The music is spot on, and the patio complements the indoor seating perfect.

My friend described it as, \"Like eating a dessert.\" Since I have a sweet tooth, I loved it. My sister order the pork tenderloin. Her friend ordered the chicken scallopine. It paired perfectly with my past. My BFF ordered scallops. Cooked to perfection. Like eating light puffy clouds of air.   Cons: Price",

We were saddened to find out that Olive & Ivy has cut back on everything food wise. You now have to \"ask\" for their bread and pesto when it was always part of their initial table presentation. The entree presentation is very plain and blah. The food portions appear to be smaller. I notified them when making the reservation that it was my husbands birthday celebration and all the past years the birthday person received a complimentary desert. Not anymore! Nothing was offered. We are so disappointed that they have become a run of the mill, cut costs, restaurant. The food and service are still good but the extras that made this restaurant stand out as a superior FOX restaurant are gone.",

What a beautifully designed place, with candles and great lighting, large windows, and an absolute deliciousness IS the essence of Olive & Ivy. Featuring a great happy hour, sangria, Mediterranean / Italian fare; it's a coffee shop, bar, restaurant, and market all-in-one. So nice and complete - a perfect offering is what I say!  Great wine selection, a fun & lively environment, and great food. Outside tables are especially lovely on a nice day or evening, but in the summer heat - no, no, NO.

My daughter and I are waiting for the mall to open so we decided to find a breakfast spot nearby.  Came across this place and gave it a shot.  At 10:30am on a Sunday I expected a long wait but was surprised that we were seated right away in a great spot outside along the water.    Waiter was great, friendly and knowledgeable but perhaps had a bit of ADD, he kept getting distracted but it was okay because he was still great.    After listening to our waiters explanation of the menu, I opted for the breakfast sandwich with a side of hollandaise sauce and my daughter got the cheddar biscuits and gravy.    We got the complimentary bread and pesto, which was to die for!  My sandwich was amazing!  The bread was a buttery flaky goodness and everything was cooked to perfection!  The biscuits and gravy were unique and amazing too!  And to top it off, as we were finishing up our meal, our waiter brought out refills and had them in to go cups.  Awesome!  He knew we were going shopping and thought we needed some refreshments for the mall.    This is going on my list of favorites!  Beautiful atmosphere, superb food and friendly people.  What more could you ask for???",

I really don't like to pay steak-house prices for medium food. That's this place.  That being said, I really do like their coffee bar/pastries (mmm the pastries!) and their gelato bar. Then you can sit outside and enjoy the waterfront and only pay a few dollars.",

It's still Arizona/West Coast influenced without needing cacti and adobe houses. I remember being really pleased with the food, but for some reason the bread really stood out to me. Their salad is, of course, a reliable option, but their good food attracts a lot of people and you're lucky to catch a seat without setting a reservation first. The servers are a bit too friendly, they might stay hanging around and make conversation with you if not every table is occupied. I'ld want to go back soon.",

The atmosphere is also a plus, with indoor and outdoor patio seating, both of which are cozy.   They also have an outside patio seating area which is first come first serve, however we sometimes prefer that over sitting at the tables because it is more relaxing with comfy patio furniture.  The only reason this place is getting 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because the past 3 times I have been there with girlfriends to grab some happy hour and/or dinner we have had girl waiters who were horrible (not bringing us water, having to ask multiple times for menus and bread, forgetting our food, adding things to the bill at the end which weren't ours, and then giving us attitude when we politely would tell them what we had and what the bill shows doesn't match, etc). We even had one waitress leave for the evening without closing us out, and without having anyone take over!! The busboy took care of us, and that is also to whom we left our tip with.

It turns out it was around the bar.  Both of the hostesses were friendly and one even complimented my dress.  We were quickly seated and was greeted by our happy server.  I started the night with a red sangria.  Pretty punchy, not super fruity which I liked.  For starters, we had the Manchego Bruschetta which came with chorizo and the Mediterranean Salad.  One bruschetta is a good bite for 2 people.  The Mediterranean salad was fresh and tasty.  The dressing was a little tangy that at one point, it went down the wrong pipe and I started coughing.  For dinner, I had the English Pea Tortellini which apparently is made in-house.  The sauce was delicious with bacon and mushrooms.  MMMMmmm, I still remember the taste of it.  My husband had the Natural Chicken with potato puree.  The chicken was juicy and although it was a simple dish, it was made well.  The portions for both were just right.  Not huge, but good individual portions.    I had a paper cut and needed a band-aid so I asked the server for one.  He went to go check and never came back so I figured he forgot, but then a lady came by and offered me different types of bandaid.  Perhaps she was the GM.  I picked the one with hearts.  That was nice of them.  They did not forget.  We asked more about the restaurant and the Fox Restaurant Concepts company and our server was knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions.  The server even brought out the list of all the other restaurants that are owned by FRC.  Overall, great food, friendly staff, tasty drinks, live DJ.  Great place to go with a group.",

While my friend and I were quite disappointed, we turned the brunch into our own selection of menu items.  Her son got the Eggs Benedict with roasted potatoes that looked really yummy.  My friend and I shared the Mediterranean Salad and Flatbread pizza.  The ambiance of the restaurant felt very brunch-like and earthy type of feeling.  I felt very relaxed and my tummy felt in peace on a sunny day in Scottsdale.",

I was having a stroke and would need to go immediately to the hospital.  As the day wore on , I realized I wasn't going to make my reservation on the beautiful patio of olive and ivy.    When I got my phone today there was a message saying they could not hold  my reservation.  I felt badly  that  I had held a table at such a busy time so I called to explain and apologize.  I sure missed my sweet potato cannelloni, which is on the menu in heaven.  As I sat feeling sorry for myself and the long rehab that lays ahead, Matt, The assistant manager of o and I arrived with the cannelloni dinner.  Ii told him the stroke must have worse than I thought because now I realized I was in heaven.  Matt and the gang at Olive and Ivy made my day.  Thank you!  Penny Latko",

The ambiance is so nice!  We ordered a little bit of everything. 3 types of bruchetta, butter lettuce salad and the pesto flat bread, all to share. Everything was delicious! Fresh with good ingredients. Our server could not have been nicer. She made sure the meal was spaced out so we could have a nice relaxed evening. And the complimentary dessert at the end was extra special!   Great place. I can't wait to come back!",

Both the hostess and server seemed bored and indifferent.  The brushetta was very good.  The scallops were tasty, but the portion was very small for the price.  The chocolate cake was pretty bland.  Another time, I think I will just have appetizers and wine on the patio and go elsewhere for dinner.",

I gave it a 4 star as I have gluten allergy and couldn't believe that they didn't offer Gluten free bread or pasta like Postino. I ordered fritto misto which was crispy and delicious calamari mixed with zucchini. I added the very ,arugula goat cheese salad half size and was in heaven. My hubby had the lasagna bolognese which he enjoyed very much . For dessert we had chocolate ganache which was too dry for my taste not chocolaty enough  All in All great experience,prices reasonable for lunch. We will be back",

The inside is great too, they have a bar that is perfect for happy hour, and a market as well with coffee, pastries, other drinks, and various sorbets if you want something light or something to go.  Don't be afraid to dive into the bread they bring at the beginning of the meal; the pesto is fabulous! I'm a huge fan of the Mediterranean salad, which I get with salmon. I have a lot of business lunch meetings here, but day or night this is a great place to work or play!",

The Bruschetta was amazing - You will come back just for this.  The steak and bacon wrapped tenderloins were also delectable!  Did I mention that we will come again?",

Also had the delicious home-made cinnamon roll! The end.",

He was serving his friends that were sitting beside us and they told us that they are friends with this idiot Bald waiter. After we paid, I talked to the manager who ignored us and told us to call him next time to reserve a place, as if he is going to do anything special. I told him that I called and reserve before hand and he just blindly ignored. I would not recommend anyone there.",

    "text": "So glad I finally had the chance to try Olive & Ivy! I have had it bookmarked for forever it feels like ha. Was looking for a place to eat brunch in downtown Scottsdale that wouldn't be super crowded on a Saturday morning, and this was the perfect spot!  When we got there, the front area was like a little cafe, you could get quick food there, and they had some tasty looking pastries and gelato up front, yum! Loved the look of the place too, and how you can see them making the food and all the fresh ingredients and everything. We kinda had to look around for where the hostess was, but someone helped direct us. We were seated quickly, and everyone working there was super nice! I usually never order anything other than water, but the cinnamon roll latte totally caught my eye and I had to give it a try! Also they brought out bread and pesto for us to start and it was so so delicious. Everything tastes super fresh. My latte was a little rich so I couldn't drink too much, but I shared it with my mom and sister and all three of us were obsessing over how amazing it tasted.  The brunch menu is pretty small, but there's definitely something for everyone on there! I got the vegetable scramble. It was pretty good. Vegetables in the scramble were cut chunky which I like. The potatoes were phenomenal. My sister got the burrito and liked it. My dad got the sandwich, and my mom got the two egg plate. She asked for spinach to be added and our waiter said yes but for some reason they put it on the side! Our waiter thought that was strange and offered to have it fixed, but it wasn't an issue. Wasn't too crazy pricey either. I would love to come back to try lunch or dinner here, it was great!",

We sat on the patio even in summer due to their misters. You can hear the music outside as well. I imagine this place is packed in peak season!  We wanted a light dinner so enjoyed salads and a hummus platter. For dinner we shared tortelli pasta with corn and English peas. It was incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection.   Great cocktail program as well.  Would definitely return!",

    "text": "Had a weird experience coming here for happy hour with coworkers. The manager redeemed it in the end, but it was still quite off-putting.  We had a group of about 20 people from work, who were going out as a farewell to one of our colleagues. Someone in our party had called Olive & Ivy the week before to ask if we could make a reservation since we had a large group. She was told that they don't take reservations for happy hour, but that since we'd be coming in on a Tuesday, it shouldn't be any problem to seat our whole group. Sounded great.  Our group arrived, and there was only enough \"happy hour\" seating available for about half of our group... despite the fact that there were many other open tables throughout the restaurant. Half of our group sat, while the other half tried to figure out what to do. Finally we asked about taking one of the other nearby tables that was empty (unfortunately not next to the rest of the group), and we were told we could sit there. The stray half of our group sat down, the server brought us water, and then left. She came back, dropped off an appetizer that our boss had bought for us, and then told us \"I can't have you guys sitting here. We have to leave these tables open for dinner service. I'm gonna need to have you clear out of here by 5.\" (It was 4:45.) So we asked \"Do you have another table we can go to? We were told we could sit here.\" She said there were no other tables we could move to, since the rest of the \"happy hour\" section was full. Mind you, most of the group was going to order non-happy-hour food.  The server walked away. Our half of the group (still removed from the rest of coworkers, including our departing friend who the whole outing was for) was left to figure out what to do. Honestly, we didn't really have any options... there was nowhere we were \"allowed\" to sit, so they were essentially just kicking us out of the restaurant even though we were ready to be paying customers. We hadn't even had the chance to order a drink. It was very awkward and rude.  As we were about to leave, a manager suddenly came over and told us he had made space for us in the happy hour section next to the rest of our group. We were immediately seated in that section, and were finally treated like normal customers. We enjoyed ourselves from that point on, but none of us could believe how poorly the situation was handled up until then.   The food and drinks were good, not great. I gave this place 3 stars instead of 2 only because the manager handled things right. It's just a shame it took so long for that to happen. This was my first time at Olive & Ivy, and I definitely wouldn't come here again by my own choice.",

We opted for indoor seating, but we noticed misters on the patio a lovely view if you prefer sitting outdoors.  The service was very good.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu items and prepared to offer recommendations based on pairings, popularity, and individual taste.    The food was excellent.  It is evident that they have put much thought into their menu.  We tried 3 types of bruschetta, veal ravioli, and their chicken main course,  We tried two cocktails, both excellent, and the coconut sponge dessert.  The bill ran about $35 per person before gratuity, but the quality of the menu is totally worth it.  No complaints.   I'm sure we'll be back.",

They have dangling lights from the ceiling. A True piece of art. On weekend nights they often have a DJ and on weeknights the area around the restaurant has events going on that are nice to walk off after dinner.   If you want a cocktail, I highly recommend the red sangria. It is out of this world. The dirty martinis are also a notable choice.   The service is just as fantastic as the food.   If you're not in the mood for a sit down meal, they also have a cafe/deli area that you can pop into for a quick to-go order if need be.",

There is almost no restaurant I love to sit outside under nice trees with sparkly light more. It seems pretentious from the outside but the servers are quite down to earth, attentive and the food is artesian and really everything I like in a dining experience. I love their focaccia bread with pesto dip starter (yes, it's free party peeps). The bread is soft and spongy and the pesto is delicious. I've had all sorts of things here as I've been a patron for over 10 years (now that I'm 25 lol!, I hope that admission doesn't age me). My favorite dishes: mushroom and fennel sausage white sauce flat bread, cheese and meat tray, pastas, and pretty much anything I order. The ice tea is wonderful too. We like coming here for brunch, happy hour, after shopping at fashion square, at night, for dates, pretty much anytime we are in the neighborhood. If you like this restaurant please look up FOX RESTAURANTS. Being the foodie I am, I pretty much love all of them. They have figured out the right recipe for great concept restaurants with delicious food. Yes, I am an unabashed Fox fan. Now I'll stop waxing poetic as I think my love for Olive and Ivy has been fully expressed.",

All the food was 100% on point and here is a break down of what we ordered:   Appetizers:  (1) Seasonal Chefs Board - great cheese and meat board. I have had better, but it was great. The breads on the board were AMAZING! (2) Lamb Meat Balls - These were also on point. Their pita bread is VERY delicious and the lamb meat balls with tzatziki was GREAT! (3) Hummus - this is honestly some of the BEST hummus I have ever had. It is flavorful and delicious!  Entree: Lasagna Bolognese - The portion was a great portion and so delicious also. Some of the best Lasagna I have had with pieces and bites of Broccoli, which was new for me, but the texture and taste profile added to the dish. The bread again with this was AMAZING!  Drink:  Grapefruit Mojito - I am a BIG fan of grapefruit, and if you don't like the grapefruit flavor I would not get this drink. It isn't so much a  Mojito but more of a Grapefruit cocktail!",

We asked someone where to order a drink and they actually pointed us a place to sit and get drinks/food, it's in the bar area and no one prior had told us about it.... Awesome! No need to wait 45 mins to be seated. Stone was our server and he was awesome! Super friendly and very helpful with everything! My husband had the breakfast sandwich and I had the gyro. Both were awesome! I also recommend instead of fries the side salad is great! Everyone is here is smiling and happy to be here! Even management is helping and that's great to watch!

We went to Scottsdale for some Cactus convention, and made it a point to stop here this time.  We ate outside on the patio, with the misters going.  I had the Natural Chicken or something like that, and it was amazing.  Chicken breast with the skin left on, over mashed potatoes.....with a mushroom sauce that is a bit misleading.  Says it is Citrus Jus, and since I am not a citrus sauce fan, told the waiter no sauce.  He suggested I get it on the side, so I did.  I tried it, and it MADE the dish.  No citrus flavor at all, very sweet like PF Chang's Mongolian sauce.  My wife got the Mushroom Pasta dish, and loved it.  Over all, one of my favorite places to go in Scottsdale.  Yelp, what is with the \"gender neutral\" restroom question?   Please!  Who gives a sh!t?  Restrooms have been pretty basic for centuries, look down, then use appropriate restroom!",

I had ordered the prawns in risotto and was hoping they wouldn't smell, but alas, they did. I couldn't eat them so I tried my honey's lasagna but it was greasy. So....not real impressed.

I have been to one other Fox restaurant, the arrogant butcher and it was yummy.  Olive and Ivy was really great, the service was awesome and I honestly believe the food was the best I have ever had.  The bacon wrapped dates were so rich with flavor it defies description.  My shrimp risotto was awesome.  The 3 types of bruschetta we had were all great.  2 other people in my party had 2 of the different pastas and they were both amazing.    The signature cocktail I had was great although $12 is steep.  I would eat here every day if I could afford it.  It came out to about $45 per person with food and drinks and it was worth it.",

All of the food that I tired was on point as well and everyone in our group liked their food. The first time I came here was for happy hour and we tried the bruschetta and truffle fries. All of the bruschetta's were bomb! Plus they were huge, split into 3 pieces, so it was perfs to share. To top it off they were $3 each. Steal! We each has the sangria and that was delish. I came back for Easter brunch a couple days later and we had the bread and pesto dipping sauce, wow! Everyone was talking about how good it was. I ordered the Mediterranean salad and it was soooo good! It was light, but filling. I even put a little of the pesto dipping sauce on top. My friends ordered the hummus, the Cobb salad, and the parfait. Everyone liked what they got. There literally was not a single complaint. Then to top it off we tried the cinnamon roll. This was super good. I only had a couple bites and we all passed it around. It's good if you go with a group to share with everyone. I definitely recommend this restaurant. It's right on the canal as well so it has great ambiance.",

It's not the best food I've ever had, but it is good and everything else combined just really make me like this restaurant.   The lamb gyro is really good for lunch. It was not too heavy and the lamb flavor wasn't too overpowering. Their flatbreads are also really good, I think we got the Mediterranean one and, honestly, anything with olives automatically boosts my liking for the dish.  It's a great place to just sit and talk and have a glass of wine with your food. Whether you sit inside or outside, it's beautiful.  Also, don't miss out on the gelato! I get it every time. I am completely addicted, but I also have a huge sweet tooth. Every flavor is delicious and they are really nice even when I ask for a ton of samples because I can't make up my mind. :)",

I love the overall theme of Olive and Ivy. The mixture of old and new school class is really nice. Servers are always attentive and are great at time management and handling all of their tables professionally and Efficiently. I had Pita and Hummus as an appetizer and it's definitely my new fave. The prosciutto mascarpone tortellini is to die for. I sipped on White Wine Sangria while I thought was way better than some other restaurants I had drank it at recently. This is the perfect place whether you're looking for a light lunch or a classy date night on the canal. 10/10 would recommend. Will be back many, many more times!",

Some of the toppings didn't taste that great together.  It wasn't bad, but I won't be back to have that again.  The veal and spinach ravioli was good.  I thought there was a sharp cheesy flavor that was almost too much.  I split that plate with my mom and thank god I did cause I could only handle eating three ravioli due to the rich flavor.  I won't be ordering that again. Overall if I were to come back, I'd order completely different menu items.  I just wasn't impressed with my choices this time :/",

I think that might be my fav so far. For entrees, we had the bouillabaisse, bone-in ribeye, and lasagna. The bouillabaisse was okay. My friends liked it. The broth lost flavor when dipped with bread. The lasagna is just lasagna and how can you go wrong? Lastly, the bone-in ribeye. Now, I'm the type of girl who an eat steak everyday, or every other day. I have eaten steak for 7 days straight. That's how much I love steak, and bone-in....yes! After having a bone-in ribeye at Steak 44 last week, I couldn't wait to eat another. By all means, I'm not comparing. But the creamed spinach was so rich that it took over the flavor and there was no steak to taste. Totally disappointing. If I were to order the steak again, I would ask to substitute the creamed spinach and not have any foods touch my steak. Also, it seemed like the chef really likes butter. I mean, probably not the healthiest dishes. I would come back but not order the same dishes. I'll keep you updated along the way....",

We addressed this and they said to go ahead and sit down and they would find a solution. We had to inquire several more times and we even offered a couple of solutions to push together available tables we saw.   In the end, they sat us at two separate tables because they could not accommodate a table of 12. If that is the case, they should have mentioned this very important fact when we called to make the reservation. There were available tables and space to push tables together so I still don't understand why they didn't do it.   The food was good. The service was good. But this one very important detail marred our experience because half of our friends had to sit at an entirely different table and it was very awkward.",

The restaurant presentation was a mix between industry and classic. Loved the ambiance!   We ordered Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken, Gyro sandwich, Bacon Cheeseburger, Sweet potato cannelloni, and Piccante flat bread. The server brought complimentary bread with pesto sauce which was surprisingly good! It was the BEST bread from any of the restaurants I've ever visited in my entire life!

    "text": "Went today for our office holiday party.   Everyone was very happy with both the service and the food. Our server Alfred was very attentive and incredibly knowledgable about the menu, both food and cocktails.   We started with the bread and pesto, which is complementary and also ordered the hummus, charcuterie plate, and bacon wrapped dates.  Hummus was flavorful with garlic and lemon and diced cucumber on top.  Dates were wonderfully sweet and soft and wrapped in thick salty bacon with a red pepper remoulade. The chef's charcuterie plate had nice thick bread, goat cheese spread, several different meats and olives.  The pesto was alright, not as much flavor as I usually expect,  but fresh and bright.  Entrees were the lasagna with bolognase, chicken panini,  sweet potato canneloni and veal and spinach raviloi.  The pasta is made in house.   I didn't try everything,  but all our party was happy.   I can say the veal and spinach raviolI was amazing!   Fresh pasta, tiny chunks of tender veal and fresh spinach in a butter sauce and pesto oil to finish.   It was amazingly rich and delicious. Dessert was lemon pudding with salted butter gelato and a spongy chocolate cake with chocolate ganache \"kisses\" piped on the plate and a ginger gelato.  They make 20 flavors of gelato in house.   I usually dislike gelato because it has a lower butterfat content than ice cream,  but theirs was creamy, smooth and delicious. Overall,   our experience was wonderful!",

    "text": "OK, OK...so I know I'm more than a little late with trying this restaurant, but in my defense I did just move back to AZ a little over a year ago ;).  I happened to be in the area picking up some shoes from Tony's Shoe Repair (which is awesome...a review for that coming soon) and was starving. I was craving something different than the usuals (Kona, Yard House and ZTejas) and I'd heard good things about this place so I decided to test it out solo.   I arrived right at the beginning of happy hour so the place wasn't too crowded yet. I was immediately impressed right when I pulled up to the place. I liked the fact that they actually had parking spots right up front instead of \"complimentary\" valet. It annoys me when that's all places have. First of all, I'm perfectly capable of parking my own car and walking. Second, NO valet is \"complimentary\". You always have to tip them or you'll look like a complete douche. I'd rather walk and burn some calories for free thanks :).   Anyway, sorry for the rant. Back to my review...  The positive vibes of this place stayed with me as I entered into the restaurant. I loved the decor and ambiance of the place. It was very open and fresh feeling. It was airy, without being to too expansive and hollow. It still had a comfort and coziness to it. It was raining that day (I know, what are the odds of that here in AZ haha) so I couldn't sit out on the patio, but from what I saw it looked like an absolutely lovely area to enjoy brunch or happy hour overlooking the water with the girls or even a great romantic date spot to watch the sun go down. The decor wasn't too rustic or too cold and modern. It was classic, cool and elegant.   I decided to just grab a seat at the bar because there were a few seats open and I was by myself anyway. It was sleek and modern and the music was at a perfect volume. It was loud enough to hear, but not so loud that you'd have to yell at the person next to you just to carry on a convo.   Since it was happy hour I decided to take advantage of the great prices and order a few apps as my meal from the happy hour menu. I skipped the cocktails this time (even though they looked delicious...especially the sangria) because I still wanted to go to the gym later that evening...and working out with a buzz just didn't seem like a very productive (or safe) idea lol.   Aside from an ice tea, I ordered the hummus plate, the prosciutto and fig bruschetta (with port salut) and also the fresh mozzarella bruschetta (with tomato jam and basil). This amount would have been a nice snack for two, and was more than plenty for me (I only finished about half the hummus).   The hummus with grilled pita bread came out first and did not disappoint! I loved how they had a good amount of chopped cucumber, onions, and little cherry tomatoes on top of the humus. It added a nice freshness and color to an otherwise monotone dish.   The bruschettas however, were by far my favorite! The tomato jam on the fresh mozzarella was amazing and added a nice twist to the traditional \"mozzarella and tomato\". It was so good that I seriously wish I could get a container of it to go and try it on everything from fries, to sandwiches or veggies. The prosciutto and fig one was amazeballs as well. The saltiness of the prosciutto plays off the sweetness of the fig nicely. I absolutely LOVED everything and can't wait to go back and try even more menu items. So many looked amazing. I was completely full when I left (and didn't even finish it all) all for under $15!   Overall, a great upscale place with great pricing (especially during happy hour), a great atmosphere and most importantly GREAT FOOD! The only reason why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the service. Maybe it's because I was sitting at the bar instead of a table with an actual server, but I asked for a few recommendations and descriptions of certain things and wasn't really given anything except for \"It's good...I'm not sure, whichever one you feel like.\" The bruschetta's were also a little slow coming out.   I still absolutely love the place and will definitely be back with friends for the food and atmosphere. ;)",

Just celebrated my end of post doc party there last night and had the best party of my life there thanks to the amazing staff!   We had folks with gluten, meat, and egg allergies and the staff took great care to prepare our order to specification even offering to substitute items on the menu. Especially loved the fresh mozzarella bruschetta and Mediterranean salad. Reasonable prices on these items.   They have a range of seating options including beautifully decorated outdoor patio with misters, fire pit, and plush seats for a chill atmosphere, indoor booths and tables (had a live DJ there too last night) with soft lighting indoors, and a gorgeous private room for events that (can seat up to 12) for a high class flair.   Usually the require a minimum charge to use their private room but yesterday out of kindness they offered me the room and waived this since the room was available and they didn't want it to go to waste. Made for a perfect evening with my friends and family. They turned the music down for us in the room so we could mingle and make our champagne toast and even let us bring in our own cake and provided us plates and silverware. Perfect amount of checking on us. Attentive waiter while giving us enough privacy.   Only feedback is to expand options for vegans and vegetarians at least by having more items available for entree substitutions. Other than that, perfect place for any occasion!! :-)",

I thought I had made reservations through the automated system but my age must be showing because they didn't have us on the list and thus no outside seating and wow, they have some lovely outside seating among these great heavily leafed trees but still, seated in less than 15 minutes.  Instead of full meals we shared a series of appetizers. I wasn't crazy ab out the Bruschetta but the lamb meatballs were good. My parents also enjoyed the hummus and I guess my overall favorite was the fresh sliced bread with the pesto sauce amazing. I did have a cocktail, the Cactus Blossom and the server did warn me it was on the sweet side but honestly, taste reminded me somewhat of cough syrup so I won't order that one again. However, you get your money's worth as I definitely felt the cocktail when it was done.  I guess I thought the food was good but what I especially liked was that the place had that operational hum of excellence which I've come to expect from the Fox Restaurants Concepts group. They know how to run eating establishments with a high end focus  and it shows. I look forward to coming back here again, though I have to try that outside seating when the weather is nice, looks wonderful. :-)",

We ordered the lasagna which was excellent, the scallops, which were good but a little dull- not sure if they were marinated or not, and the natural chicken which had a surprising amount of flavor.  Prices are a little high for what you get, but the surroundings are gorgeous.",

Our server was absolutely wonderful and patient with us. The wine selection was great and the drinks were delicious. The outside patio was romantic and beautiful. So why the 3 stars you ask?  I thought the food was nothing special. My expectations might have been higher than usual, due to my love for all of the other Fox Restaurants. The bruschetta was okay - we ordered the mozzarella, prosciutto and manchego. I feel like I've definitely had better bruschetta (Postinos).  The chef's board was nothing special either. I feel like I could have put together a better board. I didn't try the bacon wrapped dates but my friends liked it. My favorite out of everything we ordered were the lamb meatballs. It was sprinkled with a lot of feta cheese so it was absolutely delicious. For the flat bread, we did half short rib and half chicken pesto, and for pastas we ordered the wild mushroom papardelle. Again, I didn't think it was anything I would order again in the future.   The server was sweet and gave us a complimentary chocolate cake for our friend's birthday. The food was mediocre, but I would probably come back and try the other items on the menu.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I met a friend from out of town for brunch today. I didn't really know what this place about except for the fact that it served brunch and that it was in Scottsdale. The suite number is 195 off of Marshall Way. It was a little tricky for us to find it being that it was our first time. There are off street parking and if that's not available, there's a free parking garage just kitty corner of the restaurant.   We made reservations for 3 for 11:45, the place was packed so we were glad that we made reservations.   We started off with some brunch cocktails: OLDTOWN HOUND $9 rutte gin, st. germain, arizona grapefruit BELLINI $8 peach puree, peach liqueur, smirnoff vodka, prosecco IVY & GINGER $11 smirnoff vodka, canton ginger, pineapple, sparkling wine   I had the Ivy & Ginger, you definitely taste the pineapple - nice refreshing drink. They had the Bellini and Oldtown Hound - both of them enjoyed their drinks.  I ordered the SMOKED SALMON* (toasted bagel, tomato, caper & red onion)  for $11 on an Everything Bagel. This was not the best Lox Bagel I've ever had; the salmon was a little saltier than I'd like. The nice part is this came disassembled so you could put as much creme cheese and toppings as you'd like.   My boyfriend had the EGGS BENEDICT* (shaved ham & basil hollandaise) for $13.5. This was also not best eggs benedict I've ever tasted either. The waitress gave us a heads up about the eggs coming a little translucent which was nice. I'm assuming they have had a lot of questions about it.  The * means that it contains raw foods and may cause health hazards; ie the eggs/salmon and tomato (jk about the tomato).  Our friend had the LAMB GYRO (grilled pita, tzatziki, tomato, onion & feta) $14. He said he liked it.  I almost forgot.... I had the cinnamon roll. I ordered one and it was big enough for 3 people to share. It was delicious! It had to be the best thing I tasted there!  What I loved about this place - the decor/atmosphere/drinks, cinnamon roll and customer service. What I didn't care for - the food. Maybe I didn't order the right things but I'd be hesitant to order food there again.",

I came in with some friends when it wasn't all that busy but even that was a bit of a stretch for the staff. I'm not sure if it was just the day I was but they were super understaffed. At first glance, the menu looks awesome but the execution left me wanting. It just seemed like they wanted to put as little onto plates as possible, I'm not sure if they are trying to save money or if the chef thinks it's artistic. Either way, the food is underwhelming.   The location is nice it's just a pain to get too which is pretty much how all of Scottsdale is. But I knew that going in.   Just to reiterate, eh.",

Their version of a Moscow Mule is excellent. Overall we have always been happy with our drinks here but I was a little disappointed in their take on an old fashion.   Atmosphere is modern but the lighting makes it cozy. The outdoor patio is near the canal, from your seat you can see the art installations over the canal or near it.   Park at the Nordstrom parking garage if you can't find street parking or don't want to valet.",

Then we had Flat bread chicken which was well made and I highly recommend. Kale salad was also ok. Kale can be difficult to eat but they had some ok flavor added to it.  Ambience wise: This is a total date night spot. If you're looking to impress, go here.  Service wise: They said it might take 45 mins for a table but they got us a table in short fashion. I wish the waiter was as good but he wasn't. He screwed up our order. Forgot to give us bread and we were starving. He couldn't remember to bring my fiance water also..   Ambience wise: The view is impressive in how it over looks the canal. The Live DJ makes it hip spit as well.. If you're looking to impress your date. Come here.  Overall: Id come back because of the ambience.",

Had a bruschetta trio - possibly some of the best bruschetta I've ever had. Chicken scallopini was excellent. Tried a bit of everyone's dishes at the table. I think you'd be hard-presses to find anything on the menu that isn't good. Service was nothing remarkable, but I consider that a good thing in a restaurant like this. Keeps the focus on the group you're with. Will definitely return, again and again.",

Since I was alone, I didn't wait too long to be seated and sat in front of the servers/chefs bar. I did feel a little uncomfortable because I came alone (definitely a place to go with significant others or a group of people) but gladly enjoyed the opportunity to watch the servers/chefs work. My waitress was really nice too (unfortunately forgot the name) and kept me company when she had downtime.   I ordered the shrimp scampi risotto, the Mediterranean salad, and a glass of white wine. I absolutely loved every single part of my meal. The Mediterranean salad was a great palette cleanser (huge portions) and the shrimp risotto was perfectly cooked. -1 star because it was a little too salty that I needed lemon to wash it down. I was still impressed because the risotto consistency was great and in my opinion hard to perfect. The complimentary bread was pretty tasty too!   I absolutely adored the romantic ambiance.. wish my boyfriend was able to join me :(",

Didn't match up to what we found online which is what ultimately drew us here.  Like I said the decor and ambiance are fantastic.  Really beautiful place.  Nice outdoor area but it was all reserved when we came.  Busy place.  My margarita was very good.  I had a hard time picking from the menu because honestly nothing really appealed to me.  And the few items that did kind of get my attention were way too pricey (I was on per diem).  I didn't feel like flatbread so I ordered the chicken which had mashed potatoes and mushrooms.  Chicken was OK and was a pretty large portion.  Mashed potatoes were pureed so very creamy and delicious.  The best part of the meal.  My friend went with the Margarita pizza which she found tasty enough but really settled for because she couldn't find anything else on the menu.  I will be traveling a lot to Scottsdale for work in the near future and I may return for a drink and maybe an appetizer.  Just not wowed by the dinner selection.",

I really enjoyed the coffee house/market vibe of this place, especially for such a casual meal. We just ordered at the counter, took our number, found a seat, and they brought our food out to us.  While Olive and Ivy serve a myriad of snacks, including some very delicious looking baked goods I went for a healthier option - the egg white omelet. It was served with tomatoes, avocados and a side of mixed fruit. On the day I was there the fruit was mostly melon in case you're wondering. Gabi and I also shared an order of wheat toast to round out our meal.  Andrea raved about the smoothies, but I had to have coffee since it's my favorite thing to drink first thing in the morning. And the coffee here was good - smooth and dark just the way I like it!",

With a nod to the other yelpers, I was cautiously optimistic about the Scottsdale vibe [you know, are your boobs/car/jewelry big enough] enough to go with the Lovely. It was early and we had a reservation in which I had requested the patio. We drove up and although a bit put off by the $6 valet - um, really? used it nonetheless.   Seated right as we walked in, on the patio. Lovely night, perfect setting. Except for the choice of music - it seemed weird. I'm sorry, 'Play that Funky Music'?? With your filet and tempranillo? Not so much. Service was spot on, and actually a bit too 'on' I don't think its great to clear my plate when my dinner mate is still eating...just sayin'.   As others have noted, pesto and bread to die for. i tried the prosciutto and fig bruschetta which was yummy [not as good as Postino...] and Jeff had the margherita flatbread. Really fresh and light. He had the tenderloin, I had the tuna. Both scrumptious, lightly sauced and cooked to perfection. Dessert was a shared nutella pudding. Lovely unctuous pudding and whipped cream topped with roasted hazelnuts. Music to my tastebuds. Lovely texture and flavor. Wonderful coffee as well.   Nice wine list, very good cocktails and an atmosphere at least outdoors that was fab. Did i sound whiney? Dont mind me. Go, it'll be well worth it.",

I saw a few families there and I thought that was a little weird since it was pretty late. So far...it's ok. Then we get to the bad part: our waiter. I don't remember his name nor will I put him on blast here. He was horrible! First he took forever to greet us. He was very apologetic for not being attentive. Then he takes our drink order and runs around cover his section. We get our drinks maybe 20 minutes later. He apologizes again. Then he grabs our menus and walks away. That's the thing...he was always around but was so fast we couldn't ask for anything. We tried for about 10 minutes to get anyone's attention so we could order. He come back and asked if we ordered. Really?!? You took our menus... So now we get to the insulting part. I asked him if the scallops were enough to split if we order an appetizer and salad. Simple question, right? Here's his answer: oh honey, don't you know...the better the restaurant the smaller the portion. Really?!? A simple yes or no could have been sufficient. Oh and he food....it wasn't great. It was just very ok. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates. Those were pretty good. Then we had he kale salad. It was so bitter I couldn't eat it. The scallop were good. Not bad but not excellent either. I would recommend this place for drinks and small bites in the patio area but this isn't a place I would come to for great food.",

To start off with, you get fluffy bread and their homemade pesto which is amazing. I could probably just eat the pesto with a spoon and call it a night! Lol the bruschetta is also phenomenal! They have a choose 3 for $11 (I think) and all the options are great. My favorite is the prosciutto and fig, sweet but salty. Least favorite is the asparagus, just not as flavorful as the rest. For the entree I usually get either the Mediterranean salad or the natural chicken. The chicken is so moist (yeah I said it!) and delicious! I've eaten here with other people who said the flatbreads, lasagna, bacon wrapped dates, and porkchop were delicious. I should also mention this sweet potato dessert I had once. I HATE sweet potatoes but our waiter got to talking about how good it was so my sister ordered it and OMG, the best dessert I've ever had. I think it was seasonal . The ambiance and decorations here are also very inviting! Last but not least, you can dress up or down and blend in. Not your typical downtown Scottsdale 6 inch heels and mini skirt place so everyone can feel welcome!   I'm salivating typing this! Just made reservations here for din tonight :)",

    "text": "TL;DR: food good, hip atmos, but happy hour criteria was confusing and not well communicated.  -------------------------------------------------------  We recently moved back to Phoenix after living in Salt Lake City for several years and we wanted to celebrate with date night at a nice restaurant. (Sidebar, not dissing SLC, but their food delicacy is fry sauce. Phoenix is definitely more thriving in the restaurant scene). Olive and Ivy did not disappoint!   Let's start with the food and dranks. Here is a rundown of what my girlfriend and I ordered.  - Dranks: Glass of happy hour chardonnay, happy hour pinot noir - Apps: Bacon wrapped dates - Entree: I ordered bruschetta (Salmon Lox, Prosciutto, Avocado), my GF ordered Piccante flatbread  The bacon wrapped dates are delicious. Wrap anything in bacon, it will probably be delicious. I enjoyed all of my bruschetta, although the Avocado was basically just avocado toast. The prosciutto with figs were a great pairing, the figs added a nice sweet taste. I probably should have seen that coming, but I think in the future I would get the Manchego or something different. Can't be reinforcing those millenial stereotypes you know. I tried some of the flatbread and it was pretty good as well.   The atmosphere was trendy and vibrant, at least in the eyes of a man who is neither of the two. O&I would be a fun place for a date or happy hour for sure.   Based on the food and the atmosphere, I would have given this review 5 stars, but I am taking off one star because the happy hour was somewhat confusing. We made a reservation for 5PM specifically to exploit the happy hour deals ($8.5 bacon wrapped dates instead of $12, $6 house wine) because we are cheap. After we were seated, we were told the happy hour deals only apply if you are sitting in the bar/lounge area which is open seating. This was noted on the menu, but we did not realize there was a separate lounge area away from the normal seating. We asked to move to the lounge area, because again, we are very cheap. The service was very accommodating, but the lounge seating was slightly more awkward to eat from, based on the size of the table and the awkward seating. It is definitely more ideal to sit in the lounge area for drinks...which I guess makes sense for the happy hour deal. I just think it would be much less confusing if happy hour applied to the whole restaurant or if they made that more clear when making reservations or getting seated.   The other confusing thing about the lounge vs. seating area is the table bread. Seating area gets free table bread but no happy hour deals, while the lounge gets happy hour deals but no free table bread. I carb-load for a living, not because I'm an athlete or anything, but I really like bread. I also like free things. So that was kind of a letdown that we were not able to get the bread because we sat in the area for the happy hour deals.   Overall, I did enjoy the meal and the night out and I would come back here again, just a little confusing with regards to the happy hour and different seating locations!",

We had no issue getting seated for lunch without a reservation (around 1pm on a week day) outside as it was little chilly (mid 50's but sunny). They had the fire pits and outside heaters going which was helpful.   I had the artichoke flatbread (no goat cheese) and requested light on the truffle oil yet it was still pretty oily. Our kids split the cheese flatbread pizza (not on the menu but the waitress mentioned this as one of the items from the kids menu- which wasn't given to us and not sure of it exists in print but I asked for her recommendation as we didn't see anything on the menu kids would eat). The kids loved their pizza. My husband had the chicken pesto sandwich which was also a bit oily.   Overall, I enjoyed the food, it was fresh and tasty (could use less oil). The staff was friendly. And free soda water on tap is always a bonus!",

We went straight into main courses, I had the sweet potato cannelloni that was served with mushroom and spinach, topped with crunchy almonds.  My colleague had beet salad with salmon that she loved.   Dessert was a given, the peanut butter mousse - this made the peanut butter loving me incredibly happy.  It was light airy mousse topped with a chocolate shell that gave it texture and was topped with coffee pudding.  Amazing!!!  We also had the warm pear tart as my colleague is a pistachio addict.  This was good but paled next to the mousse.",

It has been a few months, but I went in the early spring and sat on the patio around the fire having drinks and appetizers.  The service was great and we had a really good time. I would definitely recommend the patio.  I went to the restaurant the other night and while the food tasted very average, the portions were small, the prices were high and the experience was not that special.  I  liked the appetizers on the patio a lot better.

The best part about the bruschetta was that each bruschetta was cut into 3 pieces which made it extremely convenient for us.

Even though on this visit our food was really slow to come out, you could tell this business prides itself on service. They sent a manager over who was apologetic for delay.

Our group combined ordered the charcuterie board which is a great sharing option, however I wish there were more cheese varieties. I ordered the scallops which is a very small dish so I do recommend ordering another dish to accompany.

It was my first time ordering it and I will for sure be ordering it again!",

Their complementary bread is great!   The rib eye steak wasn't the best meat. Not very tender.    I had shrimp with rice & it was too saucy, soupy.     My son liked his pork entry.   The ice creams out in the case at front look good but taste icy and my mint & chip was bland.  Servings are too small as well.   I will come back but I think I'll just have appetizers.",

    "text": "Olive & Ivy is a beautifully decorated, spacious restaurant with an amazing patio area that faces the water. We parked in the Nordstrom garage before heading across the street to the space.   The interior is very cool too and we were promptly seated for our reservation at 7pm. Waters and menus were already waiting for us as we had a group of 8. The menu consists of some lighter bites, salads, pasta and flatbreads, and a few meat and seafood entrees. The drink menu is on the back with wines, beers and cocktails listed. They had some delicious-sounding cocktails but I declined to indulge on this visit.   After putting in our drink orders, our server brought bread out for the table. It was tasty and came with a nice dipping sauce. I ordered the salmon bruschetta to try first and wow.. it was delicious. The salmon chunks were smaller and mixed in with everything else so it was easy to eat and the flavor was perfect. I wold definitely recommend if you like salmon, all of their other bruschettas sounded great as well.   For our entrees, I ordered the veal and spinach ravioli and my girlfriend ordered the margherita  flatbread. The ravioli was amazing... the flavors were so on point. It was creamy and delicious, I practically inhaled my portion. My girlfriend enjoyed the flatbread which was a decent size. Others at our table ordered various salads, flatbread and pasta and all seemed pleased with their meals too.   Service was okay, a bit slow but I give a little pass considering there were 8 of us. Could have been a bit friendlier but not the end of the world.   Overall I would definitely recommend this spot considering the food was so good. Would be a great date place or somewhere to hang out with a few friends. And sit outside, it's so nice!",

My friends and I were seated immediately for a Friday lunch around 12pm, but it looked like it was getting packed pretty quickly. I ordered the chicken panini with a side of their daily soup while my friends ordered their lamb burger and Mediterranean chicken salad. Complimentary breadsticks with pesto were very yummy and piqued our appetites before the entrees came out. I liked the soup a lot, and the panini was pretty standard.   Excellent service and aesthetic interior - while waiting for our food, we were admiring the cute air light bulbs adorning the ceiling above us!",

That was wonderful. I could lick the plate if it possible. I like the sea bass is crispy and tender. The grapefruit works so well with the plate. The sauce is also amazing. My boyfriend got spicy shrimp risotto w/white zucchini, arbol chili & lemon. There are tons of shrimp and the risotto taste wonderful as well. We had guava sorbet as dessert. For the price I think it is the cheapest sorbet I had in the restaurant. It taste good and real!! I wish I had a chance to visit Olive & Ivy again.",

The space is large and the tables are spaced nicely, making it a nice date night spot.  The food was really great.  We had the hummus for an appetizer, which was amazing and had just the right amount of garlic.  For entrees I had the scallopes and he had the bacon wrapped pork tenderlion, both of which were supurb.  Dinner was a little pricey, but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it.  If we visit Scottsdale again we will definitely return to Olive & Ivy.",

I ordered the Sangria, and that was not Sangria, i lived in spain, i know what Sangria tastes like, and that was like wine mixed with water....It was super strong as well, so at least if you didn't like it you could get drunk quickly and forget.   We ordered the Calamari for the appetizer and it was so so. It was supposed to come with Aioli sauce, once again, i've lived in spain, i know what aioli is and what its supposed to taste like. I felt like this tasted more like dill dip....   We ordered the Shrimp Risotto which I was thoroughly looking forward to, but it was bland.... It was a cream sauce without any real flavor to it. The side potato dish was better than the risotto, but it was nothing more that scalloped potatoes.   The honest truth is that the best thing i had while i was there was the bread and olive oil pesto dip. Which is ridiculous when you think how much you're paying to eat here.   Another thing i would say is that everything we ordered was recommended by the server. I'm totally not blaming him, because we wanted to order it before we even asked him, but he told us each time that it was a good selection.   Generally, I might try it again, but it wont be anytime soon and I'll be a lot more skeptical.",

Everyone had some wine, our waiter/service was great, and the food was to die for. We started out with the Parmesan Truffle Fries as a starter - OMG - incredible!   I had the Free Range Chicken which was not only presented nicely but tasted even better. I wasn't a huge fan of the veggies but the mash and chicken were SO good. Everyone else had fish and since I don't eat that stuff I can't comment - but I know everyone was impressed!   We divulged and finished off the night with the Peanut Butter Torte. Again: OMG. The torte itself was amazing but the salted peanut butter gelato on the side was INCREDIBLE. Sigh. Definitely worth the wait. And if nothing else the people watching was fairly priceless...",

Olive and Ivy is the Fox Restaurant of choice for consistently good food, great drinks, and most of all, outstanding service.  I spend a lot of time in various restaurants across the valley and am always amazed at how bad service can be at some of the more popular valley restaurants.  Not Olive and Ivy.  From the first phone call for reservations, to the greeting upon walking in the door to the smiles and warm reception you receive from every server you cross, this restaurant knows how to make you feel special.  Many of the reviews here will focus on the food and I could spend hours talking about my experiences but I will sum it up in a couple of my favorites.   I hate dates and prunes, but the bacon wrapped dates are crazy good! The shrimp and risotto main course is one of the best dishes I have tasted since arriving in Phoenix 3 years ago.  And hands down, their short rib entree is best in the valley.  The only catch is the cost.  Olive and Ivy is not cheap and definitely not for brothers looking to execute the cheap date.  With wine, apps, and main course, you will easy break the century mark, and if you are really being generous, $200 is obtainable.  But, it's worth every dollar and who knows, you may even get breakfast out of the deal!",

Over the last couple weeks I have planned a night out for my wife and I for celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary and our first baby boy on the way in the end of October, and I must say I am extremely satisfied with Making Olive & Ivy part of the plan! My wife and I originally walked into the Marketplace side door but a worker there was happy to lead us to the hostess stand and then we were led to our table. We were greeted by our waiter Josh P. who congratulated us on our 6 Month and our son on the way. This impressed me and took me by surprise as the waiter who I have never spoken to in my life congratulated us right off the bat. He gave us time to look over the menu but never left us stranded. He filled our drinks without a hitch, never reaching over us or interrupting our conversation. Josh then brought out this amazing bread with this sauce they didn't look good off the bat but was out of this world! My wife ordered the lasagna and I ordered these awesome little pasta raviolis' filled with cheesy/creamy awesomeness. From appetizer to entree then from entree to dessert, Josh wiped down the table and made everything fresh and clean. Also during our stay one of the managers, Kim, stopped by and somehow beat Josh to the punch with filling up our drinks. I'm not sure how others feel but for me it's awesome to see a manager work on the floor and see the managment team working alongside the waiters. I wish I had pics of all of the good because it was awesome, I will make sure to return ASAP as the food, staff and environment is great, thanks Josh for helping us celebrate on a special night out! Hope to see you guys again soon and will make sure to sit where Josh will be our waiter!!!",

    "text": "Olive and Ivy has to be one of my favorite lunch spots here in the valley. The inside of restaurant itself is beautiful but I've always taken the opportunity to sit outside on their amazing patio. It really is like sitting out on your own little garden patio - minus the 50+ other people that might be out there! Whether you're seated under a shade tree or next to a bubbling fountain, it is hard to believe that you're still in the middle of the desert. Besides the patio, the food is what keeps bringing me back to the restaurant. Everything is made from scratch - and you can tell! The salads are flavorful and filling, the sandwiches are delicious, and the flatbreads are innovative and wonderful! Possibly the best parts of the meal are the pesto and bread and their white sangria. Every time I've been there I wish on a little star that the pesto and bread would continue to magically appear on the plate in front of me. I also have yet to pass up the opportunity to get some of their white sangria. The orange sugar coated rims adorn the sweet and flavorful mix of fruit and white wine (again wishing that would never end as well!). Because of the beautiful space, delicious food, and helpful staff I am happy to give Olive and Ivy 5 stars!",

I ordered two cinnamon roll \"centers.\"  I'm not sure why they call the rolls centers, but I do know that they are really big and really good and really gooey.  If you want your morning sugar rush, get one...or two.  I also got a raisin croissant.  It's called something fancier, but I have no idea what.  It is $3, but the thing is the size of two regular croissants.  It didn't have quite as much raisins as I would have liked, but it was flaky, buttery, and had a nice sugary glaze on top.    FRC, you all need to open a joint or two in Vegas!",

I went for brunch and ordered the egg sandwich with the egg cooked over easy as the waiter told me the egg could be cooked any way I like. I don't eat meat, so instead of the bacon I asked for more avocado (which the sandwich already comes with). When my sandwich came, the egg was not cooked over easy, it had ONE LITTLE sliver of avocado, and way too much mayonnaise. My sister couldn't decide between ordering a margherita flatbread or the Funghi Trifolati flatbread so our waiter suggested she do both. The Funghi Trifolati was the best part of the meal, and I wish we just ordered a whole one. We had the chocolate cake with the toasted marshmallow for dessert, which sounds yummy, but is actually just more of a challenge to eat the \"hard-to-cut\" marshmallow.",

We went to have brunch on Sunday and it was pretty packed in there. After looked at their simple brunch menu, we decided to get Grilled Hanger Steak with Scrambled Eggs, and Cinnamon French Toast with Fruit Compote & Syrup($8.50).   It wasn't too impressive, the food was just ok- 3 Star. I think you pay more for the ambiance than the dishes. The service was alright- 3 Star.  It felt like you are in the market with chit chat and bargain noise, which i thought it was kinda annoying.",

The WORST was that my boyfriend ordered a couple glasses of 18yr Macallan before I ordered one. I don't know what they brought me, but it certainly wasn't the 18 year, though we still got charged ($$$) for it. We did a couple blind taste tests just to be sure... Maybe they thought I wouldn't be able to tell the difference? They should be ashamed. The food was pretty good, but really overpriced. We sat outside and the atmosphere was nice. Definitely will not be back and will never recommend this place. For the money we spent, our dinner should have been flawless.",

    "text": "Terrible experience. Would never recommend.   Background: I was here as part of a bridal party, and the problems began right away. We had enough people coming that we were not allowed to place a reservation outside. Fine. We'd just make do with open seating on the patio. There were 4 of us in our late 20s/early 30s that arrived first. I guess we made a mistake and had too many seats around our table. Rather than just politely explain it to us, our server snapped at us and kicked the chair out of her way. After we apologized, moved things, and fixed it, it took 15 minutes before she'd come back to take our drink order despite standing nearby. When we placed our order for our first round of drinks, we started by asking if we could please split our check. We were told we were only allowed to split our check for food and drinks if she took all of our credit cards, but combined with other comments she made, it was meant to ensure we'd actually pay (to be clear, we'd just asked to split our 4 orders into 2 sets of 2). By this point, more of the group was showing up, primarily some of the older relatives who proceeded to sit at a different table; we later found out that she had no problem splitting the check at this other table (perhaps trying to guarantee she gets at least one automatic gratuity?). She proceeded to completely ignore us and wouldn't bring any more water or anything except to the older members of our party. When we all ultimately ordered our food, we also ordered another round of drinks, yet somehow our drinks only came out at the same time as our food (as in, much later). My food was also a little on the cold side. To be perfectly honest, we suspected at the time that she was irritated that us younger couples were splitting meals and not each ordering one. We still had to flag down anyone that passed by just to be given water.   In the sake of fairness, here are some positives about the place. The decor, particularly outside, was gorgeous. If you told them you were splitting food, it comes out pre-split (hopefully you were planning on splitting all parts 50-50). The food itself was also pretty good (albeit with small portion sizes).  Overall, spend your money elsewhere, particularly if you look younger. If you still choose to go here, prepare to be treated poorly and ignored while paying too much for small portions.",

Being from Denver where we've admittedly become spoiled with a great restaurant scene, I found this place to meet and exceed my high expectations.  The bruschetta are all amazing (def try the prosciutto) and the drinks were spot-in with generous pours and unique options.  Bacon wrapped dates are not to be missed as a starter as well.  Go ahead, sit on the patio and enjoy the umbrella of shade provided by the trees while listening to the fountains.  It's like free therapy while you eat good food!  Enjoy!",

Id never been to O&I but the Waterfront view is what I was looking for and the NYE Menu sounded amazing, I was elated that they called me early afternoon NYE to tell me they could make our reservation.  Our waiter Stew was polite, attentive, efficient. The complimentary pesto dipping sauce was delish and I would have been content eating just that. I ordered scallops, which were good. I havent had scallops that I liked that much in a long time. I also got a small portion steak with the scallops. My mother ordered salmon which she was enjoyed. After I told Stew it was my mothers birthday he brought her a slice of chocolate cake and candle on him which made my mother feel special.

I was pleasantly astounded by how amazingly delicous the bruschetta was. Definitely pick 3 for $11 to try as many as possible! We got the proscuitto &fig, manchego, and butternut squash. I was in culinary heaven. I'm not even that interested in bruschetta, but these are an absolute must-get here. They were each an explosion of impressively creative flavors.  From the Small Plates menu we had the Artichoke Hearts, which was a fresh and yummy arugula salad. I was initially most excited about the Lamb meatballs- but this dish was the least tasty and we could've passed on it.   We had the Kale Salad from the Greens section which was very good as well. I liked that they allow half order of salads when you order an entree since when forced to decide between getting a salad and a hearty meal, my vegetable serving of the meal normally loses the battle.  From the Pasta section... omg the Sweet Potato Cannelloni... disclaimer: I love most things made of sweet potato, but this was truly a delicious dish with soft sweet potato center wrapped in pasta, with a creamy mushroom and spinach sauce. We couldn't finish it since we had ordered so much, and I very happily finished the rest as breakfast in bed as my first agenda of the next day.  Overall, one of the best meals I've had of late. Compliments to the chef for a creative and delicious menu.",

I could eat their complimentary pesto + bread for my meal and be totally satisfied. YUM! Their Mediterranean Salad with chicken is my FAVORITE! I also recommend the funghi, roasted brussels sprout, and butternut squash bruschetta. Everything is so fresh and delicious. I will absolutely be back soon. Even just for a drink on their gorgeous patio, it is worth the visit. This is also a great place to bring out of town guests so that they can get a good feel of the Scottsdale vibe!",

    "text": "I frequent Olive & Ivy quite often -- almost once a weekend, in fact, since I love their brunch menu.  The food is definitely not the best, or the most exotic that can be available, but I find it very good nonetheless.    The normal routine I find most in tune with my taste is to walk in mid-morning and put my name in (I always end up waiting, though it's normally only 5 minutes, so its completely negligible), which gives me just enough time to grab a mimosa for my brunch mate and I.  The mimosa's are somewhat of a hit-and-miss, meaning the ratio of ingredients ranges depending on which bartender does the job.  Really though, they never are bad, and much better than countless other establishments I've patronized.  The food is very good in my opinion, and the pastry basket is a nice addition to any brunch, though it's definitely not for those on any sort of diet!  I usually order the mushroom omelet, which works great for any sort of low carb diet, and I am always happy with it.  The atmosphere is pretty good for weekend mornings, though I haven't yet tried a dinner here yet.  I've heard fairly good things from everyone I know that has gone, though.  The outdoor patio is somewhat of a rarity in the Valley of the Sun, which is a shame since the 8 or so months out of the year when the weather is enjoyable (they have portable heaters during the winter), the spacious patio is very nice.  There are expansive sofas surrounding a fountain, and arranged tables throughout the outdoor area.  The wait staff has been generally good, though sometimes they have forgotten to bring us water, which is honestly no problem.  If you remind them, they almost come running back with it.  Overall, I continue to come when I'm available, and definitely recommend it to anyone going into the area.",

    "text": "I understand! I do! I get it that I'm a 22 year old guy that doesn't look like he could tell the difference between caviar and cold salty bean dip, but honestly when I went out for a nice sweet date night with my bangin' girlfriend, we had no idea that we were doomed to be shoved into the day care section at the haughtiest country club this side of Cafe la Ritz.   Everything felt good as our hostess walked us back through the crowded dining room. However, the fuzziness in the pit of my stomach soon morphed itself into a dull pooing sensation as we were plopped down at a table next to another set of young diners. Soda pop and water was on their table, and sexual tension (theirs) was in the air as we lifted our menus to let our eyes feast on the over priced menu.   Our service was fine, with the exception of a few awkward mishaps with our ID's, but the real issue was the food. Maybe it's just my misunderstanding of fine dining, but I thought that really good food was always served in small portions(because of the high quality ingredients, which in turn are high price ingredients) but tasted really really AWESOME. Olive and ivy only accomplished half of this with their veal and spinach ravioli. Wow, I didn't know that chef boyardee could be sold for 14 dollars. It was so bland, super under cooked and needed a serious hit of salt.   On the upside, I got a Sausage and mushroom pizza that was pretty good, but not amazing. Hand tossed...meh. Fennel Sausage...okay. This is one of the top five pizza topping combos and SHOULD be totally delicious every time. But I still think their are better places to get some killer sausage and mushroom pizza for a way better price.   On the way upside, my girlfriend got the red wine sangria and it was delicious. Smooth and sweet, but not too sweet like fruit punch or some crap. It still had the taste of wine, which rocks, but it was soooo cold and fruity and refreshing.   All in all, it was just alright. Maybe I expected too much. Maybe I thought that I could have the perfect restaurant experience. Ambiance, good food, good service. I guess that when things don't go right it gives me something to talk about, complain about, moan about. Like the right wing, or bad ranch dressing.",

GREAT place!  I absolutely loved it.  Just from the look of it, I was anticipating that the menu would have pretty pricey items on it.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that their Sunday brunch menu was VERY reasonable.    First off, the actual restaurant is gorgeous!  They have a really charming, adorable patio that is great for enjoying a sunny Arizona day (plenty of opportunities for that!).    Next subject...the food!  Definitely a gourmet feel with a hint of familiar additions like tator tots! ;) I noticed something on the menu called the croquet madame.  It sounded a little different, a ham and cheese grilled sandwich with a fried egg on top and some weird sauce that I could barely sound out!  Weird means that I definitely had to TRY IT! lol  It was soooooo delcious!  I savored every bite!  The different flavors errupted in my mouth! yum yum yum!   I have no doubt that their dinner menu is fantastic as well.  I will most definitely be checking it out again when I'm back in town!",

    "text": "We came here on a Friday afternoon/evening right after work for happy hour.  My wife had been given a gift card for her birthday for the Fox restaurants, so we decided to spend it here.  The happy hour is very underrated, and I'm not sure why we don't go more often.  Wines are half off, both by the glass and by the bottle.  Cocktails are a couple dollars off, and beers might be half off as well.  We've had the cocktails before, and they are solid - not my favorites, but strong, well made and tasty.  This time, we opted for a bottle of wine - not a bad deal at half off - ended up being a $15 bottle of Reisling.  My wife is still figuring out which wines she likes so she asked for advice in picking one out - the bartender made a recommendation, and then poured her a sample to try before we committed.  She liked it, so he went and got us a fresh bottle to share.    The appetizers and flat breads are also half off during happy hour.  We had the bruschetta - quite tasty, although it seemed like it was served on wheat toast, nothing overly inspired.  Had the prosciutto etc been served on a more intriguing bread...it would have been perfect.  Also, the fried calamari was tasty and light and cooked perfectly.    If they don't bring you some of their fresh made foccacia and pesto dipping oil...ask for it.  It was the absolute highlight for us.    All in all, good drinks, good food, service is great...and the happy hour prices are very reasonable.  My only tip - get there early if possible if you want elbow room.  The bar area seems to fill up pretty quickly - by the time we were leaving (6pm-ish) we had people hovering waiting for a spot at the bar.",

    "text": "I had lunch here and it was fantastic. Having never been on a  weekday (since I usually go for their Sunday brunch) I was very surprised to see how large of a menu they offer. So many choices...  I went with the Ahi Tuna. It was under the salad menu, but it really wasn't a salad. Three pieces of delicious tuna were seared and then drizzled with a soy dressing. On the side was a shaved veggie salad, also good, that came with mushrooms mixed in.   Surprisingly, this was very filling. I had two cups of their Victrola coffee (a new fave) and left very, very, very happy - with the food, the service, the atmosphere... It's just great here!   Sure, I paid a little too much for lunch, if you ask me. $15 for my salad, but it was one of the most pricey items on the menu. (What can I say? I couldn't help myself). I paid about $2.50 for coffee with fresh cream. Mmmm. Love the fresh cream. Love the coffee!   Speaking of love, you can buy their pesto in their market area. It goes for $1 an oz, so be aware of that. Also in that area you can buy single beers. I'm not sure if you have to drink them there, with your food, or if you can bag it up and go. Hmm. Will have to check that out the next time I go. I did discover that the service on the market side of things is very lacking. It's a good thing they have the restaurant side. I absolutely love going here!",

The areas are nicely divided and its absolutely perfect for large groups. Sometimes the stench of the \"waterfront\" aka canal can creep up on you, but its usually fine.   What to order? I typically don't get dinner, but like to share small plates like the flatbread with my party. The sangria, margaritas and wine are all really good. Oh - and if they don't just automatially bring it over, but sure to ask for the bread and pesto. Delish!",

We ordered a TON of dishes, mostly salads, appetizers and flatbreads for sharing.  One in our party has an allergy to garlic, so we requested that garlic dishes be flagged.     When we arrived, the kitchen was finishing up our order with  \"Garlic\" written on all applicable boxes.  In fact, just about every box.  Chad, who was running the kitchen, pointed this out and then suggested a risotto specialty that was garlic free.  While his staff whipped it up immediately (the restaurant was medium busy at the time), Chad went about retrieving breads and sauces to make our meal even more enjoyable, more stuff than we deserved.  He stayed with us until everything was complete and triple-checked.    The food was very good, though judging takeout -- without proper heat and presentation -- is hard.  But we will be back when we are in Scottsdale because Chad and the rest of his staff are True hosts and restauranteurs.",

Super comfortable, with good seats/couches, heaters (which for Arizonians is a must), and acoustic musicians...I hear at night the bar can be somewhat of a pain because of overcrowdedness.  Food was solid. For app: Prosciutto with an abnormally large portion of meat. Fried Calamari which had a good reception for those who ate it and an awesome salad.  For dinner: I ordered the short rib which was fantastic...however when I first looked at it...wasn't so sure. Not a big portion upon first glance but after devouring an extremely tender piece of meat (even sharing a few bites) I felt differently. The pureed corn was a nice touch and I was extremely satisfied once finished. The dessert looked just as good and was from what the rest of the table said.  Only downside: Waitress seemed preoccupied the entire meal and not really all that friendly. No recommendations, monotone, and looking over your shoulder as she explained the specials and taking your order...maybe she wasn't a Cubs fan....who knows.",

Now, I come from California so my idea of a \"waterfront\" is very different than that of someone who lives in the desert. I'll give Scottsdale some credit though; the \"waterfront\" looks better when you're sitting beside it, at night, eating pesto and bread with sangria at Olive and Ivy.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table for three on a Wednesday night. We sat outside on their very nice patio right on the \"waterfront\". They bring you pesto and bread to start, and its so delicious and plentiful, we probably didn't need to order an appetizer. The appetizer we did get was the calamari which was delish. A friend and I split a pitcher of sangria...a little pricey but good. For my main, I ordered the mediterrean flatbread with no cheese and it was very good. The portion was huge so I took almost the entire thing home for lunch the next day. Service was good and the atmosphere is nice, especially the outside.  Overall, very good experience. A little on the pricier side (if you order drinks!) but I think its a great place to start a night out with friends.",

    "text": "I had to take some clients out for dinner yesterday and asked my wife for some eatery ideas.  She suggested this place which I never heard of and I must admit I jumped to some negative conclusions.  I expected to find a pretentious, small portioned, over priced cafe next to the \"Scottsdale Ditch\" (sorry I meant to say Riverfront) where the seen and want to be seen hang.  When we showed up not a lot of big surprises.  There is parking for about a dozen cars on the cul du sac for all of the shops but never fear there is the trusty valet who has already coned most of them off  (is that even legal?) and will happily park your car for six bucks a throw.  Sorry, I digress.  It's just one of my pet peaves.  To be fair the restaurant decour was a pleasant surprise.  Very contemporary; open room, high ceiling with an outside patio next to the ditch... uh river.  The restaurant was about half full which was a departure from most of the others in the area which were empty.  I mean like not one party inside!  We were seated in a back room with floor to ceiling window views looking out on the patio and river.  Now you can't exactly see the river from the restaurant cause they planted bushes on the edge of the patio.  I'm paying a premium for a water front experience... where's my water?  I read about lousy service here but ours was OK.  They kind of figured we were here to spend corporate money on a big party so they were  tip motivated.  The general impression from around the table was that the food was excellent, portions were ok, prices kind of high but what do you expect in that area?  The wine list is extensive and pricey and the sommelier is well schooled in spending your money.  With my thirsty crew I was looking in the two figure column and he was making three figure suggestions.  Ouch!  Bottom line.  I would return to Olive & Ivy but maybe in the fall so I can sit on the patio and get a peek at the beautiful Scottsdale river.",

Anyway, I love the variety of their weekend brunch, unique egg dishes, yogurt, and  cinnamon french toast.  They also have pastries, juices and even gelato!    I love taking a break from shopping for O&I brunch on the weekends, but I would be fine to never go there again after dark.  It is a classic Scottsdale experience in which the women are competing for most makeup and least clothes and the men are all wearing the same rhinestone Ed Hardy or 7 Diamonds shirt and way too much of whatever cologne is the 2008 equivalent of Drakkar Noir.

    "text": "Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic.   Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away.  Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldn't have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the \"handmade\" bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly.   The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of \"I am well\" versus \"I am good\" seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal.",

    "text": "We went here with our daughter for a late lunch today. The truth is I can eat anywhere from trashy to classy. I tend to sit in the middle because that is where I find the best customer service and food, usually. That being said, my partner likes the upper middle fancy to fancy places. So he made reservations to go to Olive & Ivy. It is a typical Scottsdale place. Nice, clean, usually average service. I, however, LOVE Fox Restaurant Concepts and was expecting a sharp on point presentation. We arrived to average friendly hostesses, were seated and then approached by a waitress who brought water and then my ice tea. I asked for a sugar caddy for my tea. She said, \"Sure\" and off she went... not to return to the table. 20 mins later we were approached by a manager, Jake, who clearly saw that we had been sitting there for that amount of time. He came over and I explained the situation thus far. He had paper in hand and was ready to try and correct this experience asap! I have to say, I was in the mindset to never return! Jake worked his magic and our food came out in under 10 mins without the quality being compromised. He took over our table and was on top of refills, making sure everything was perfect and did his best to make us go from \"Never Again\" to \"I'll give them another chance.\" That was his whole goal and he succeeded with flying colors! Thank you Jake for making what easily was going to be a one star come back up to a four star. I'll give an update review the next time I visit!",

    "text": "Customer Service is HORRIBLE!! I was meeting my husband and son at 4:00 for a late lunch, and from the time I walked in the front desk girls took their sweet time seating us. They talked about all the tables in the restaurant while I waited and waited in front of them  It was so rude and obnoxious to have customers waiting. She then told me that she can seat me, but we would have to be done in 2 hours because they have a big party coming in.  I told her we would be done, but would like to sit outside.  She told me that she can't put me outside due to the fact that it might rain at 7:00.  I told her that's 3 hours from now!!!! Then her manager Jimmy came by and by then I was upset and told them that it's rude to have the customer sitting there waiting. I asked to be seated. I told them I had been there for so long that I even knew how many seats were open.  Instead of apologizing Jimmy said, \"Good for you!\"   I finally sat down and my family came in.  When I told my husband what happened he immediately got up and wanted to leave.  On our way out Jimmy, the manager stopped me to \"apologize\" and I told him to not treat people like a jerk next time so he'll have nothing to apologize for!!   I have supported Olive and Ivy for YEARS!!!  I come here all the time and have celebrated many important events here.  There are MANY restaurant choices in PV/Scottsdale area. I wont be supporting this one any longer, and I'm happy to spread the word on how horribly I was treated.",

They make the BEST yogurt/fruit/granola bowl anywhere. The coffee is good. I have never had  bad or mediocre service there.   It's a great place for a date, business meeting, special event dinner party, girls lunch, happy hour...etc... etc..   Advice to mgmt- Keep up the good work.   P.S. While I've always had good service here; today I had a server named Tommy. A++++++ The perfect mixture of personality, service and leaving you alone while being attentive. Amazing!",

    "text": "I love Olive and Ivy. It is a tried and True staple, always the first place I bring an out of town visitor.    The ambience inside is warm and charming, open and friendly, and classy.  I loove thier lighting it is just so inviting.  Tables are spaced nicely, the bar has great seating and not too packed in that area either.  You can order a meal at the bar without feeling like you're knocking elbows with the person next to you.  The outside of Olive and Ivy is my favorite though.  The social hour seating fills up QUICK - get there early.  There are comfy big chairs and couches right outside the waterfront.  It is my favorite sitting spot in all of scottsdale to eat drink and dine.  For food -- I've come here plenty, and here's my two cents. Skip the apps, share a salad with a friend, and enjoy an entree. I keep coming back to the veal ravioli, it is just heavenly and perfect.  There is arugula on top with a light cream sauce which isn't too heavy at all. I have to force myself to explore the menu because this dish is just so good.  Last time I was here I was trying to stick to my diet, I ordered the salmon and subbed spinach instead of thier regular side.  The dish was perfect, salmon was grilled to perfection, a real fresh piece of fish. It was generous too (more generous portion than the ravioli) - and I actually ended up taking some home. My mom ordered the Cioippino, which was flavorful, a generous portion, and very good also.  I also love their scallop entree.  I don't eat a ton of red meat, but I went with a friend one time who ordered the steak and pretty much devoured it.    As for drinks -- thier sangria is amaze! Stick with the red one.  Honestly I'm writing this right now, a warm February day in Arizona, and want to leave work to sit outside and eat my lunch in pure bliss at Olive and Ivy. I have a day off later this week and will make sure I stop by.  I simply cannot get enough of this place.",

Even though it is pretentious it is \"Scottsdale Pretentious\" meaning you can come in with jeans and a nice top and you'll be seated. 4. They allow substitutes and exclusions. I ordered the kale salad (yummy!) but wanted it without bacon and it was no problem. I have been to places with the whole \"No. We are making it the way the chef wants\" this is not one of those places.  Cons: 1. Its pretentious 2. It's a Fox Restaurant meaning it is a restaurant group. If you want a local, independent restaurant with vision of some struggling kids putting themselves through culinary school and opening up a restaurant and that the profit goes to their children softball and dance classes well this is not the place for you.",

Not a bad thing, just a mismatched expectation-reality thing.  We started with some bruschettas. All good! Especially loved the mozzarella and apple caponata ones. For my main I had the big eye tuna--gorgeously done. Nice big chunks of meat that were seared nicely, on a bed of couscous and yumminess. I tried a bit of my dad's spicy pasta. SO spicy. Impressively spicy, really.   The desserts were also great, and I have a hard time picking my favorite. Perhaps the coconut cakes in that soupy coconut sauce. I didn't get to try the chocolate cake but it looked really good.  We were in the back room which offered us *some* respite from the noise of the restaurant (a great thing when they bring in an actual DJ and you're just trying to eat dinner!), but it also offered a blast of cold air each time a server went outside to help one of the diners sitting under a heatlamp. Oh well.",

His energy and happiness was contagious, and you could tell he had a passion for the food he served his guests.    The food is great as well - the Lamb Gyro, Mediterranean Salad, Chicken Panini, Bruschetta, Calamari, Caesar Salad w/Salmon...all great lunch choices.  But I have to admit...I look forward to the bread and pesto they bring to the table as much as anything.  SO good!

Take note, they typically offer fresh foccacia at the beginning of the meal, and it's easy to fill-up on it if you've already ordered bruschetta, too!  Lots of love for the butternut squash, fungi, and prosciutto and fig bruschetta.  We really like the funghi trifolato flatbread.  The sweet potato cannelloni is sweet and savory, and it's a rich dish but very good.  I've also had the bone-in ribeye, which is good and was cooked medium rare.",

    "text": "So this place is pretty fabulous!  I've been here on several occasions; for both lunch and dinner.  The food is remarkable and I want to decorate my home like this restaurant!  From the wall of wine bottles to the rustic atmosphere, this place has all the decor eye candy you could ask for.    Lunch time here is so nice, especially when they have the wall of windows opened towards the canal and the patio.  I ordered some bruschetta and the Margherita flatbread.  To start, we were brought some bread with house pesto.  I need to have this recipe, it was amazingly flavorful.  The service here is impeccable as well, our glasses were never emptied and there was always someone nearby that would check on us throughout.  The food I ordered was so tasty and you could tell they use fresh ingredients.  Will of course back for more!  Dinner time was to celebrate a birthday.  Our reservation was for 930pm.  Once we arrived we were promptly seated and brought out water.  Once the rest of our party arrived, we were immediately taken care of and ordered our food.  The restaurant at this point was pretty busy, but they had the windows open so the sound just flowed right out and made the already spacious space feel that much bigger.  I ordered the Potato Gnocchi Pomodoro.  Oh. my. goodness.  This was so crazy good.  I love gnocchi and could eat it all day, and this just hit the spot.  So perfectly seasoned and cooked, definitely comfort food in my book!  Everyone loved what they ordered and had no complaints.  Overall, this place is amazing and you can't go wrong going here for any occasion or time of day.  **Love it!**",

    "text": "Okay, so this review is long overdue!  My husband and I came here as we were spending our day in scottsdale. So we had lunch here for our anniversary in March.  Our waiter was Stephen.  He was very friendly.  We told him that we were celebrating our anniversary and he joked that we looked too young to be married. Haha. Anyway, we both ordered the same thing. I can't recall the exact name but it was a bacon cheeseburger with fries.  We also had margaritas. The waiter said the beef would be cooked meduim. I thought it'll be meduim close to well done but it was meduim rare. I never eat my burgers that way, but didn't think anything of it at the time. Fast forward three, four hours later,  it caused food poisoning.  Maybe it was my fault for eating meduim rare when I never do, but just be cautious if you are like me. The food poisoning was really bad. It caused several days of vomiting and diarrhea.  Apart from that, the waiter was super nice and got us a cake as an anniversary gift (on his tab). We were seated on the verge of outdoors and indoors, so the best of both worlds. We really had a good time so it sucked that I got sick! We will be returning,  though.  It wasn't their fault.",

Friendly staff and delicious food. Their bruschetta is awesome. Lots of variety to choose from.   Also got some gelato. So many yummy flavors and they didn't mind us sampling each and everyone of them. I ended up getting the white chocolate mint. OMG the mint punches you in the face, it's so good.  Would've love to come back for dinner.",

The service was absolutely horrifying. We were seated by a hostess who didn't do so much as to smile or make eye contact once with our group. She was cold and uninviting which was surprising considering there wasn't a crowd or any reason for her to be so distant. When we were seated, it took about ten minutes before we were given a menu. I had a Caesar salad which was unfortunately so horrible I had trouble getting beyond a few forks. The bruschetta's were okay at best.  The only appeal this restaurant provided was aesthetic. It is beautiful. If you are looking for a great dinner, drive past Olive & Ivy. However, if you're after a gorgeous dining decor, this is your place to go.",

    "text": "O&I is the bees knees - face down (ass up) one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix, for sure!  My significant lover and I stumbled upon this place by accident, we were actually trying to find Culinary Dropout but my (retarded) GPS led us astray but lo and behold - Olive & Ivy stared at us...and we stared right back into its glorious face.  It's a huge restaurant and has a very upscale/classy vibe, but still maintains a romantically casual mood.  There's plenty of outdoor seating but what really takes the cake is the private dining in the back, which you typically need to reserve in advance unless you're lucky.  Service is always friendly and spot on but, of course, what really shines is the food.  Allow me to plan out your entire meal for you (you're welcome):  1. Start with the trifecta order of bruschetta and pick: prosciutto & fig, manchego, and fresh mozzarella.  You have not truly enjoyed bruschetta until you eat the aforementioned ones.  2. Prosciutto & mascarpone tortelli for sure.  3. Chicken scallopini - so tender, so juicy, so flavorful, AND it has prosciutto and mozzarella.  What more could you ask for?  4. If you're feeling baller I say it's justified to spend $38 on the Filet of beef.  You will not regret your choice...unless you accidentally forget and order the bone-in ribeye instead (I warned you).  5. I'm not big on getting dessert here since Gelato Spot is just down the street, but if you're up for it - try the peanut butter pudding.  Bonus Tip: Go to Costco (or visit the website) and pick up the Fox Restaurant Concepts gifit cards.  You can buy two $50 giftcards for only $79.99, so that's 20% savings right there.  And there you have it.  Get your gift cards from Costco, make your reservation on opentable, book the private dining area, experience heavenly flavors, and get ready to fall in love with Olive & Ivy.",

This is one of my girlfriend's favorite FRCs but for me it falls closer to the bottom for some reason.   It might be the menu options not being quite up my alley quite as much as some of the others but don't get me wrong it's still a great spot. The Patio is amazing, I had my favorite dinner out there.   For an appetizer we got the artichoke hearts which were well done. Our waitress made a good recommendation on wine. I had the sea scallops which were cooked perfectly.   The inside is very impressive as well. They have a market attached which has some good stuff in it. All in all a solid restaurant.",

Definitely ask for the fruit topping on the side though. It's overwhelmingly sweet and would probably make the french toast a bit soggy.  We also ordered a lox bagel which was delicious! The bagel was toasted just right along with a lovely array of toppings including a whipped cream cheese, salmon, capers, and sliced tomatoes. YUM!  So I had to update this since I just opened my left overs.. I usually prefer to box things up myself at restaurants for this reason: The rest of my french toast was thrown in with the fruit sauce and is now ruined. :( The worst part is that there is no side of maple syrup! I had plenty left when they took my plate.. How am I supposed to eat this???",

After a little Yelping we decided to give Olive and Ivy a go since we were going to do some shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square. Walking in to the restaurant the first thing I noticed was how high the ceilings were and the massive wine storage they had. We made a reservation before we took off so we were sat immediately. After we had been sat at a table, we were greeted by a very nice server named Casey, who gave us a rundown of the specials and encouraged me to order the eggs Benedict (spoiler alert: the eggs Benedict are phenomenal and the best I've had in the valley). They bring you a delicious pesto and bread dish to snack on while you wait. My fiancee ordered the Mediterranean salad and said that it was great. The eggs Benedict was excellent - the warning Casey gave me was that the eggs come out very soft, which I love, but if you don't you will want to modify your order. The potatoes are fantastic too! Our food came out very quickly and the entire experience was really great. I would highly recommend Olive and Ivy to anyone! We will definitely be back for dinner sometime!",

Also, 45 people were running around \"working\" yet you cannot get empty plates off of your table or a water refill. The charcuterie board was so pathetic - save your money as they only put a measly piece of disgusting cheese on it, which is the size of your thumb. I cannot even believe that is offered on their menu!! The whole point of a charcuterie board IS an assortment of cheese(s). The other food we ordered was mediocre.

I usually dine at night because the setting is romantic with mason lighting in the inside. Fireplaces and mason lights line the large patio overlooking the waterfront. Very versatile with a good sized bar for drinks, private events area, outdoor patio, booths, tables, couches, and a coffee/breakfast counter. The moment you walk in you're always greeted by a friendly host or hostess. The servers are uniform and dressed to fit the atmosphere. They are always very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. Ask for the house focaccia and uniquely divine pine nut pesto. My favorite way to start the meal. The wine is allowed for tasting and placed in a beautiful chilled stone. Chefs board is enough for 2-3. Thinly sliced meats and delicious fig spread. I'd prefer if there was more cheese since there was a lot of bread and other mixings. The mushroom truffle tagliatelle will forever be one of my favorite pasta dishes I've had for the fresh thin noodles and perfectly seasoned sauce. On another occasion we had the dessert and it was plated beautifully balanced with different textures and temperatures.",

The bartenders are obviously swamped so they are sloppy with their cocktail creations, with luxardo cherries carelessly dropped into my old-fashioned drink, waiting to be diluted by the generic ice cubes that overflowed from the glass.    Frito misto and lamb meatballs sounded like heaven but when the plates arrived, the frito misto looked like sad calamari rejects from Olive Garden.  Not sure what proportion of the meatballs were actually lamb but they sure resembled the factory-made ones they sample at Costco.    Now I'm not some grumpy old fart but what's with the loud music being blasted by the DJ awkwardly positioned by the door? Such a weird vibe in a weird space- it was all so disappointing...",

Don't wanna lie to you, we came here for the Happy Hour, this girl has to save some coin, I've got kids!  Happy hour selection is small but big enough to find what you want!  This is what I've tried there for happy hour, ready?  1) Bacon wrapped dates, OMG! They were delish and HELLO, there's BACON!  2) Lamb meatballs, good grief, they were tender and so delicious, total party in my mouth. Their Tzatziki sauce was on point too!  3) Their french fries, rather, their TRUFFLE FRIES, someone hold me back!!! Totally shareable. God, they were good.   4) Hummus. Who doesn't love hummus? Served with grilled pita and some veggies, it was delightful.  O.k., o.k., I get it, I pretty much ordered everything off the happy hour menu but the prices were so darn cheap.  BEVERAGES!!!  Ladies, order their Sangria, 'nuff said.",

    "text": "As a foodie visiting Scottsdale, Olive & Ivy came highly recommended. Based solely on service because I sadly didn't even taste the food, what a complete letdown. I know from their sister restaurant, Zinburger, that the powers at be won't be thrilled to read how we were treated by the staff.  Let's call the pretty lady at the hostess stand with intense attitude \"Miss Personality.\" Upon arriving at 8:55 for a 9:15 reservation, we were curtly told we'll be seated closer to 9:15. Normally that's fine as that's indeed when the reservation is. However, there was not a single other patron waiting to be seated. A quick walk around the restaurant and I saw not just one, not two, but numerous - maybe six or seven available tables - with about four of them being two-seaters, which is what we were. After waiting for five minutes, we decided to go spend our money at one of the many and plenty of other restaurants in the Scottsdale area that are equally beautiful, with equally or even better food, and much better friendly and professional service. I hope Miss Personality enjoyed whatever power trip she was on, but she lost us as a prospective customer, sadly and regrettably. This isn't LA, New York or Miami - attitude is not expected nor welcome.",

I also like the fact that I can walk around the corner to see my buddy who is the GM at the #Scottsdalewaterfronttowers.   The ambiance is good and you can tell that this is a tourist hub for those catching the AZ during the discounted summer months. My meal was good and the wine we selected fit perfectly into the mix. I was only there for lunch with friends from Napa, so I need to come back with Twyla and catch this place at dinner. There is a full bar for those who wish to get their IV drip of alcohol moving into the infused direction; you know who you are...  Once your meal is completed, you can take a romantic stroll along the waterway and then venture around to the many various shops for coffee or dessert. Not that Olive and Ivy doesn't have a good one. However, I could use a good walk to burn the many calories I take in on a regular basis. There are so many things to see and do in this area. I do recommend checking it out with the whole family.   #vino2 #vino2ultimate  #vinosquared",

Cooked to perfection) I must add that one of the highlights is that they stuff their own blue cheese olives and make their own blue cheese as well...so the martinis are extra good ;)",

A big thank you and hats off to our server Jeremy, who did an excellent job in providing us with superb customer service!!! He is everything a perfect server should embody :-)   Honestly, I came in with low/medium expectations because this place reminded me of a fancy version of Lemonade (a chain restaurant in California) serving Californian cuisine, which is good, but not my favorite. Jeremy assured us that their cuisine is more Mediterranean than Californian so that made me instantly happy!   On to the food-   COMPLIMENTARY BREAD W/ PESTO- AMAZING!!! The pesto sauce is the best I've ever had. It was thick and packed with flavor, loaded with pine nuts, and not overly drenched in olive oil. The bread was light and fluffy- off to a great start  CHEF'S PLATE ($18)- GET THIS. I dream about this plate. I was hesitant to order this at first seeing that it's pretty pricey for an appetizer. This could easily double as an entree, but I would still recommend getting it even if you already ordered an entree. This was one of the BEST charcuterie boards I've had. I could rave about this for the rest of my life. Plat included: * 2 kinds of bread- a buttered, light & crispy artisan bread + an extremely soft loaf of bread that melts in your mouth. 2 kinds of artisan cheese- one strong gorgonzola + brie-like soft cheese. * 2 kinds of meat- spicy salami + prosciutto * a LOT of olives, dates, pistachios, and pickled lettuce.  I loved all the contrasting textures and different tastes of this. My taste buds were doing backflips! I found myself still digging at this even after I finished stuffing myself with my meal. By far my favorite!!!   BACON-WRAPPED PORK TENDERLOINS ($24)- These pork loins were perfectly caramelized and had this EXTREME melt-in-your-mouth quality. My knife sliced through them like butter and it was the perfect amount of chewy and tasty. Came with yummy mini potatoes, collard greens, and polenta. This was such a good choice and is one of the more filling meat plates, as mentioned by Jeremy.   WILD MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE ($16)- This pasta gave me life. They use a lot of truffle oil in this dish and it pairs really well with the mushrooms and parmesan slices. The pappardelle pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente and topped with fresh basil throughout.   I enjoyed every second of my meal and my experience with Jeremy and would 100000% come back next time I visit Scottsdale.",

Several months later (we live in the west valley) we did just that, for lunch.   Our server Zack was friendly and efficient. The manger Nate was very kind, as he stopped to check on us a few times throughout the meal.  The food:  Bread and pesto is amazing!  Fritto Misto was perfectly fried and had sliced zucchini included, nice touch.  Sweet potato cannelloni may be my favorite pasta in the Phoenix area.  My husband had the lamb gyro and was very pleased.  We tried 3 different flavors of gelato, and all were unique and delicious.   Try Olive and Ivy. You won't be disappointed!!",

I enjoyed the small pearl couscous as it adds something new to the Greek salad I often eat. I liked the tiny dice on the cucumbers. Perfect size. The sliced almonds added a great crunch to the salad. The oregano vinaigrette was tasty. A bit under seasoned, but that was remedied with the pepper milk on the table.   There was a 30+ wait for a table, but they offer tables w/out a server with a limited menu.   $9.50 each  **As I was leaving, I asked for a cup of ice to top off my water bottle. The cashier asked if I had my cup from ice before. I gave it to her thinking we're using less plastic. Nope, she took the cup I drank out of and before I noticed, she used it to scoop out another cup of ice. Boom! Instant cross contamination in the ice bin. I didn't tell her, as I was shocked.

    "text": "I finally got around to trying this place. I was up in Scottsdale and decided to stop for lunch. The ambience is really cool, but the food was very average. Disappointing to say the least. I had very high hopes, but I probably won't be back.  I guess if you are just going for drinks or to meet a potential love interest, this would be a great place. It's very trendy in a warehouse type environment.  The decor is very inviting. It looks the part, but unfortunately does not deliver on the food end. Prices are on the higher side, but not terrible and not unexpected for the Waterfront. At least if you go, wait til the weather cools off and then you can eat outside.  5/18/19  Same. Three (3) stars. Small portions, flavorless food and very very average.  Service was slow. Not sure how this place stays so busy. Had it not been for my guest who wanted to try it, I would not have come back.",

Staff was friendly and timely. Got the Mediterranean salad with shrimp. The shrimp were large and the dressing was good. Nice spring mix of lettuce. The chicken hash and the gyro were also good. The gyro is a large portion so def can share or take leftovers. Would come again for lunch!",

I ordered the egg sandwich. It was really good! Usually, I do not expect much from my egg sandwiches, but this one was perfect -- not too heavy, and they did not go crazy with the cheese (I love cheese, but sometimes places tend to melt WAY too much onto your egg sandwich).  Further, the drinks were so good. We ordered an assortment, so I got to try a few. My favorite was the Bellini. It was light and refreshing, and delicious. It really was the perfect drink on a scorching hot (112 degrees HOT) day. Also, I loved that it was not heavy at all (at least it did not feel heavy), so I did not feel bloated after drinking it.",

    "text": "Okay this is complicated.  My GF and decided to give Olive and Ivy a try as we had dinner last week across the way at Tapas Papa Frita. Anyway, Saturday afternoon around 3, not much of a wait. Right at the point where still doing brunch, appetizers after 3 and full dinner menu after 5. Fine  Our server recommended a wine that was featured so I ordered a glass. When the wine finally came it was nothing like what had been described. Turns out the 'featured' wine was several days ago and has since changed but the server was unaware. Ordered a beer. Fifteen minutes later beer finally comes.   Ordered the Frito Misto as an appetizer and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger (medium) and my GF the gyro.  Finally get bread. Bread is delicious!! As is the homemade pesto. Not a big fan of pesto, but theirs is the best I've ever had. Period.   Still waiting for food. Server informs us we might get our entrees before our appetizer. What? Then someone else delivers the app. Start about halfway through app, food arrives.   Gyro and fries. Great! Burger and salad? Salad tasty, burger over cooked. Took awhile to get someone to check if our food was okay.   Refired burger. Still over cooked. Manager comes out and apologizes, says meal is on them.   Third burger. Still well done. Sincere apologies from management and our server. Also gave us $50 gift card (didn't have to) and of course no bill.   Fourth burger. Great. Look, everybody can have a bad day, it's how you respond that matters. I never expected any comps, just a properly cooked meal. And when a few unintended mistakes happened, they really did everything in their power to make it right.   We will absolutely be back, this time for dinner (amazing choices) and I have no doubt it will be s five star experience. This could have been one star but Dan and Rachelle changed that.   Update: Went back for dinner, service was excellent, food was excellent. Very glad we gave them a second chance.  The ambiance in this place is great.  And our server Miranda was totally on top of everything.",

    "text": "An excellent meal in a great location with a fun, upscale spot.   Olive & Ivy is a very large restaurant with at least 40 tables inside plus a huge patio.  There is a counter-service area on one side where meals are purchased to go, a full bar in the center and tables surrounding.  There is counter seating overlooking the kitchen as well.   Lots of hustle and bustle because the place is so big, but surprisingly not very noisy.  It was very easy to carry on a conversation.   We were seated immediately.  Our server, Eddie did a great job.  She explained the menu with a charming and joking style, got the orders exactly right and even had the kitchen plate a shared salad separately.   Great job.  Thank you!   The meal starts with complimentary bread and pesto.  The pesto is fantastic, creamy and garlicky.  It's a shame that you feel compelled not to eat it all, since there's good food coming!   We had a bruschetta trio, and the chopped chicken salad.  There are 6 bruschetta choices on the menu, of which we chose 3.  Mozzarella, Proscioutto and Avocado - each served on thick slices of toasted, crusty bread.  Each piece is sliced in thirds.     The mozzaralla is thick chunks of rich, moist cheese atop tomato marmalade, garnished with basil.  The prosciutto is an outstanding thinly sliced dried ham served atop fig preserves and port salut cheese.  The avocado is chunky mashed avocado, sprinkled with feta and garnished with sweet corn and scallion.  It's hard to say which was the favorite, because there were all absolutely delicious.   The chopped chicken salad was chopped romaine, tossed with half dollar sized chunks of juicy, tender chicken breast and topped with blue cheese, bacon, avocado, peanuts and dressed with a fantastic buttermilk dressing.   The ratio of ingredients was perfect, so one did not overpower the rest.  The buttermilk dressing pulled it all together.  Yum!   The tab was $38 including soft drinks, very reasonable for food of this quality in a wonder atmosphere.  Recommended!",

    "text": "We finally got to try Olive and Ivy and our experience was worthy of 5 stars!  On a Saturday while the Persian festival was going on at the Scottsdale Waterfront, we decided to have lunch at Olive and Ivy. We got there around 3:00pm. Our friends arrived before us and were told there was a 40 min wait. It took us a while to park, probably because of the festival but by the time we did, our friends were already seated, before the 40 min were over!   While we were looking at the menus, we were told only their limited menu was available for that day because of the festival. The limited menu was honestly not very limited! It had great flat bread options, appetizers, mains etc so we had quite a bit to choose from. I ordered the pesto chicken flat bread and my husband and friends ordered the lamb gyro. We also ordered a plate of mixed bruschettas, lamb meatballs and fried calamari zucchini.   Everything we ordered was delicious. I enjoyed my flat bread very much. It had chicken, pesto, cheese, tomato, caramelized onions and pine nuts & had a lot of flavor; it tasted great. I also tried the calamari which was good. My husband and friends tried the lamb meatballs & they said they were very good too. The bruschettas were also tasty, but they were slightly soggy when we had them. That's probably because they came out at the same time the food came out so we didn't get to enjoy them till later. We would have preferred the appetizers to be out slightly earlier than the food obviously but because we were very hungry, we were ok that everything came out at the same time.  Although they have a discount coupon for the first visit on their website, we did not use it this time. The prices overall are the average for a upper scale restaurant in Scottsdale but overall, not too expensive.   So glad we finally tried Olive & Ivy. Will definitely come back to enjoy the food, the location and the experience!",

    "text": "Olive & Ivy, though somewhat hidden in the mix of Old Town Scottsdale and Scottsdale Fashion Square, is a popular restaurant frequented by 50-somethings trying to look like 30-somethings and 20-somethings showing off all of their 20-somethingness. The sunglasses are big, the shopping bags more expensive than I can afford over a lifetime and the tans as dark as they come.   The atmosphere is swanky and there is often a Jason Mraz wannabe playing his music just inside the door. I've been seated, at one point or another, in each room of the restaurant. The red room in the rear near the pizza oven can be a bit tight but is a nice choice if you want to hear each other from across the table. The main dining area can get pretty loud - but it makes for great people watching. The white room has a lot of appeal with its large chairs and high cloth-draped walls. The problem is, as I was seated here for a client dinner, is that the humongous circular table creates a yelling match across the tables. Don't make any important business deals here. Maybe it would be better for a bridal shower. Eh. It's cool looking.  The waitresses are attentive and deliver drinks and pesto and bread dip in a timely manner. The bread/dip combo is delicious! I would go just for that if I could. I usually order the flatbreads. My favorite is the prosciutto with arugala. Delicious!   Olive & Ivy also has a cafe/market that is great for lunch. If I'm feeling simple I get the grilled cheese which is always satisfying or I get one of their delicious sandwiches.  Overall a great place to eat and be seen, a perfect combo for Scottsdale!",

The wine room is more casual, the bar area has a trendy feel, and the dining area is date night appropriate. The ambience can suit your mood. The food is absolutely delicious and tastes as fresh as can be. The wine is tasty. Overall for the quality the price is right. It is a great dining experience every time I go!",

It's located in the beautiful mall of Scottsdale and on a nice day, you can sit outside by the water. Our entire group left wanting more. The ambiance is great.. they even have live music on Sat's/Sun!! I ordered the vanilla bean yogurt parfait and the Greek chicken salad.. and It was to DIE for! I was also excited to find out that they have one in Newport Beach.. can wait to check it out!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  After reading all the rave reviews, my girlfriends and I made a dinner reservation two months in advance for my bachelorette party. When we arrived on a Saturday night the hostesses were dismissive and couldn't find our reservation, even though someone had called to confirm it the day before. The hostess wouldn't even acknowledge my friend, so the rest of us headed to the bar for a drink (the bartender and the drinks are the only reason I gave one star). Eventually our reservation was located and we we were seated outside next to the dumpster. It was a very windy night and the smells from the dumpster and the cold were such a turn off - we asked our waitress to be moved, she left and never returned (after dropping off water for half our party). The hostesses continued to be unhelpful and the manager was even worse!  He just scratched his head and couldn't figure out what to do.   Lastly, some other friends not at dinner had ordered champagne for the table, had their credit card charged and as we left none of the waitstaff or manager had any record of this, no apologies...a week later my friend is still disputing the charge.  This is probably the worst dining experience I've ever had...with no actual dining involved!  We left, walked to Cowboy Chao....AMAZING!!  Great service, fun atmosphere and delicious food!",

Admittedly, the setting is pretty scenic, but I kind of felt like I was in a suburban \"upscale\" mall restaurant that was trying to be more chic and happening than it could ever hope to be.   I went with a Cobb Salad, which should have been a simple choice but the leaves seemed a bit wilted and the entire serving just a tad bland, even after a hefty dosing of pepper on my part.   Still, service was relatively fast and friendly, so if I worked nearby, I can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one's lunch circuit. No doubt about it, the best thing going here is the waterfront.",

From the cook taking our order and customizing it for us, to the front of the house  manager walking around picking up our finished items along with a bus boy, it was a relief to have such great service after having had not much sleep. The food was delicious too, and I don't mean just for airport food. The trafitional breakfast with eggs bacon potatoes and toast was pretty standard but the breakfast club hit the spot. The staff was so unbelievably nice and cheerful it was such a nice change from the normal airport routine. It was a good fast food but full service combo in a bistro type setting. Stop by here when you pass rough the Phoenix airport!",

They feature a full-dining side and a market side where you can get anything & everything to go, including lattes and smoothies. Agan, great service on either side of the restaurant, but the full dining portion is rather slow.",

    "text": "In celebration of how awesome our team is at work, we were taken to Olive & Ivy. We were seated at a large table inside that overlooked the patio the fountains and the \"waterfront\" (i say \"waterfront\" because it's actually a canal, and it seems so silly to refer to it as the \"waterfront\"). The weather was beautiful, so all of the sliders were open, and the view was actually really nice.   We started out by ordering two bottles of the Russian Jack Pinot Noir. It was the perfect choice with our dinner- light but flavorful. I'd definitely order it again. We also ordered two flatbreads, the sweet corn & tomato and the asparagus & wild mushroom. If you really twisted my arm, I might say that the corn & tomato was my favorite. But they were both so delicious, that it really is a tough decision. Before bringing our entrees, our waitress brought out the focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce. I had to really try and restrain myself from eating all of it, so I would still have room for dinner, but it was hard because that stuff is delicious!   When my meal arrived, I was slightly disappointed by how small it looked. I thought that maybe I should have loaded up on the focaccia while I still had the chance. I had ordered the Sweet Potato Cannelloni, and after the waitresses ravings, was really hoping for something a little larger. But when I took my first bite, everything changed. The sauce was so rich, and the only thing I can think to compare it to was cake. Each little bite of cannelloni was taking a bite of the best cake I've ever had. It was so sweet, but not overly sweet. And with little pearl onions and brussel sprout leaves scattered throughout, I was seriously in Heaven. I devoured my meal, even though I felt full about half way through, I just couldn't stop.   The ambiance and service was great, but the food was amazing. It's definitely on the pricey side, but so worth the cost. I encourage everyone to stop in for a little bit of Heaven.",

For lunch I sat at the bar and received prompt service and a friendly banter from the bartender. My glass never stayed empty and my Lamb Gyro was sent over right on time....and oh my was that thing delicious! I finished my meal with a decadent blackberry vanilla gelato from the marketplace.   A little while later I chose it again for a casual brunch with my visiting sisters this weekend. Being from LA, I knew they'd appreciate the atmosphere and decor. We opted to sit outside on the gorgeous patio. Our server was warm and genuine, and he spoke enthusiastically about his favorite meals.  We ordered bellinis that arrived in big, fat glasses filled with perfectly peachy effervescence. The bread and pesto was just divine. It's clearly fresh and house made; didn't take us long to devour it all. My veggie scramble was perfectly made accompanied by whole wheat toast, softened butter and housemade strawberry jam.  My sister's turkey grinder was a bit heavy on the turkey but light on the lettuce, tomatoes, pepper and oregano that was supposed to give it flavor. It's Definitely a sandwich for someone who likes their protein.  It was my other sister's Lamb Gyro that stole the show. Again, tasty, perfectly done Lamb with the right balance of ingredients.",

The atmosphere is fabulous...love the decor which feels sort of chic, elegant yet understated with a great mix of colors and textures...I'm very aesthetic and a beautifully decorated restuarant ususally enhances my reviews :)  We were seated in the far back room which was nice, comfortable, well lit and very quiet.  I was immediately impressed with the lunch menu which felt very comprehensive and certainly not overpriced whatsoever.  I opted for the Curry Chicken Salad ($11) which includes field greens, chicken breast, sliced almonds and golden raisens with a two dressing combination of creamy curry and a red wine vinagarette which I ordered on the side.  I ate every last bite of the salad.  She ordered the Heirloom Beet Salad ($11) which was a very nice presentation.  The focaccia bread with pesto dipping sauce edged my carb craving.  Oh, I can't forget the fabulous Black Iced Tea (with a hint of tropical flavor) which was just delicious.    The service was extremely friendly and attentive...absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  It was an extremely nice dining experience and I'm looking forward to returning soon.",

It had been years since my first trip, because I had dinner on my first visit and wasn't head over heels for the place.  On this occasion, friends of mine chose Olive & Ivy for a Sunday brunch.  The weather was beautiful in Scottsdale so there was a 30 minute wait to eat outside.  We were not in a waiting mood so we sat inside.  The ambiance of this restaurant is very cool and the service is good.  My frittata was eh.  It was not a meal I would rave about, which is why Olive & Ivy only gets 3 stars from me.  However, my friends really enjoyed their meals.  My friend Jess ordered the Margherita flatbread and commented that she would order it again without hesitation.  My friend Mollie enjoyed her Chicken Panini.  I almost gave Olive & Ivy 4 stars because it does have a fantastic brunch menu. Also, the pine nut pesto and bread that they bring to the table is scrumptious! I will return to Olive & Ivy again with a strategy.  I will order the vanilla buttermilk pancakes (saw them on another table and was super jealous!).  If I go for lunch, I will order a flatbread (because so many of those looked so fantastic).

Had to wait a very long time (about 30 min) before the waiter came by to take our drink order, ordered food at the same time.   Didn't see the waiter again until the food came, got a vegetable frittata which was very undersized for what it cost ($11) but did have good flavor and was gluten free as noted on their menu.   Never saw the waiter again until bill time, and I had wanted a second drink. At that point, every single person at the other tables had paid and started leaving before our waiter even came back to give us our bills. Worst part - I was automatically charged an 18% tip for terrible service.   While i understand that waitstaff should be fairly compensated for handling a large party, this waiter was responsible for 2 tables, not a very hefty work investment. That I couldn't elect not to tip when given bad service was an insult on top of it all.",

The food is consistently fantastic and you can't beat that free bread with the pesto. I took my mom, brother, grandma, and 2yr old daughter yesterday for lunch. We started with the Tuna Tar Tar Tacos. My mother and brother LOVED them. My daughter ate at least two big pieces of bread and tore up the pesto. How many 2yr olds are eating pesto? really. The general consensus was that they loved the food and wished I would've brought them when they first got into town.  I ordered my favorite chicken panini w/fries. It's just too good to get anything else. Don't get me wrong, I still take a taste of everyone else's food so I know what to recommend to my future guests. That panini with the cheese, zucchini, roasted tomatoes, roasted chicken........mmmmmmmmm......so good. They also have great fries, sorry to say but second to Gordon Biersch Brewery's.

I assume that the Hostess did not know how to check someone in that had a reservation.  While this was eventually resolved I did take several calls and emails to do so and they only way it was closed was for us to provide a copy of the receipt to open table to verify that were had arrived for our reservation.  While the service, food, and beverages were fantastic the attention to detail needs just a bit of polishing.",

The 1st thing I asked about(and the ENTIRE reason I suggested this place ) was the AMAZING Cherry Bread pudding dessert I had the first time I went. They don't have it anymore. I was so entirely distressed by that answer I wanted to walk out. But alas, we stayed. I rodered the sausage scramble with a side of toast and it had the perfect kick of spice. I also had the rasberry mojito and it aimed to please. My friend ordered the flatbread on my suggestion and it was also excellent. The food is great, above average, prices are well.. it's pricey but you'll defintiely have leftovers, portions are more than decent. So I can't say you don't get your money's worth However, if you're looking for \"dive\" prices for brunch..in a not so \"Scottsdale\" atmosphere...head to Giligins.",

Ordered a round of martini's to start the night off. First mistake - they gave us the martini in a lowball glass with straws. The server said they were short on martini glasses. Seriously? The martini itself was an equivalent of a juice box. (We measure our martinis against our own or AZ88's).   We started off with the calamari - a little rubbery (undercooked) but okay. Not sure why they pair it with zucchini (filler).  D had a filet mignon - he said it was okay. I had the Sausage Flatbread, I smothered the leftover pesto from the bread dipping on the pizza to kick it up a notch. The toppings weren't spread evenly the corner pieces were bare of toppings.  The atmosphere was very noisy and few waiters that were easy on the eyes. Our server was very attentive. Didn't really enjoy sitting right next to a family and I don't think they enjoyed sitting next to a gay couple.  I give this place a \"meh\". Location is about the only thing it has going for it.",

    "text": "\"Old World meets new at Olive & Ivy Restaurant & Marketplace, which blends the flavors and timeless elegance of the Mediterranean with contemporary California chic. Olive & Ivy brings a slice of a bustling Mediterranean neighborhood market to the Scottsdale Waterfront.\" - Fox Restaurant Concepts.  A great location for a romantic dinner, swilling late night with your friends, or stopping in for some gelatto.  What makes this restaurant unique is the marketplace where one can order fresh baked breads, purchase wine, or delight in their gelatto.  In the dining room await an array of contemporary mediterranean dishes.  I will come here again and again for three things: the Parmesan truffle fries ($5) the red sangria ($7 for a nearly orgasmic bevy of tempranillo, cassis, blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry) and patio seating.  As with virtually 90% of Scottsdale establishments, there is ambiance, beautiful people, groovy downtempo beats, and a great view of the canal  (lol) on the outside patio.  The rack of lamb with beech mushrooms, fava beans, and piquillo pepper marmelade is one of my favorite dishes here.   It is quite succulent, and has a wonderful smoky grilled taste.  The free range chicken with wild mushrooms, English peas, and citrus jus is also another delectable dish. Though these ingredients are so simple, I smiled inwardly as suddenly I was transported back to my grandmothers kitchen. Ahhh! Food nostalgia, it's why I eat.  Cons: No happy hour  Prices are the usual for a moderate upscale restaurant in Scottsdale.   Appetizers: $6-$12 Entrees: $17-36 Salads: $8-$10",

    "text": "\"A steak so tender you can cut it with a butter knife....\"  Ummm, yeah, me thinks not.   Here's the dealio. I am an avid red meat and steak consumer. I can't live without a good dose of meat in me each week...wait, what....yeah, so bearing that in mind, when I came to Phoenix for this work trip, I knew I wanted to have a steak and a nice glass of spicy red wine at some point and so we came here since it was right near the bar we were at earlier.   As soon as we walked in I dug the place. The decor is pretty elaborate and it's easily a million dollar design. Even the bathrooms look like spreads in design mags and with the high ceilings and intimate lighting, it's a home run visually.  After waiting about, oh 20 minutes, we were seated at a table and we all perused the menu. There were quite a few goodies that looked yummy, but my heart and stubborn mind was on steak and a medium rare one at that! I also wanted to try a salad, cuz I was starving and so I ordered the Caesar along with my Rib Eye.  The Caesar was okay at best. It definitely skimped on the dressing, so if you like your Caesar salad, Caesary, then maybe order a side of dressing as well. Then there's the rib-eye. A magnificent looking piece of meat it was, but what did they give me to devour it with?   You guessed it, a butter knife.  Really?  Really.  What in the Backstreet Boy Hell kinda bullsh*t is that? I probably wouldn't have given the tenderness factor a second thought had it not been for the struggle to cut it with the wrong utensil. And it wasn't an oversight either, this is what they intentionally give you to tackle your dinner with.  La-me.  I enjoyed my meal and the steak was tasty, but please, do yourselves a favor and upgrade to steak knives, because it's not tender enough to slice a dull blade through.",

We ordered one of their pizzas (really tasty) and the hummus (decent). It was nice to just enjoy the atmosphere and the food. We split so it wasn't very costly and was the perfect portion.  The 2nd time it was bit more costly and not really worth it. I had the bacon wrapped pork (really yum) and my friend ordered the scallops (he said they were too salty and not worth the money).  So, basically, my review is eat here when you want a great patio and view and split an appetizer and course. otherwise, it's not really worth the money.",

The interior is very chic and they open up the side doors so that you can enjoy the amazing weather both from the inside or the outdoor patio.  I can imagine the dining experience is wonderful but I have yet to return because the chaos surrounding the bar did turn me off.  It took us about 30 minutes to even got close enough to the bar to start a drink order.  Granted, it was a weekend but with an establishment this large they need more servers (maybe some called in sick that night).   The next thing that turned me off was the overabundance of the pretentious patrons.  I am told that  Britney Spears has dined here in the past.  I guess I was supposed to be impressed by that but all it did was make me wanna throw up a little in my mouth.    I should actually come here for a meal once and see how I like it .

The food is beyond delicious - my favorite is the egg sandwich that comes complete with avocado, egg, cheese, mayo, bacon, and all served on a deliciously fluffy croissant. My sister loves the hanger steak with eggs and asparagus too!  The staff is very nice and accommodating. Olive and Ivy serves potatoes on the side of my egg sandwich, but they are always eager to please me when I ask or a fruit salad instead - sweet juicy fresh fruit in a bowl is the perfect addition to a delectable breakfast sandwich.   I also highly suggest the morning cocktails. My mother and I visit Olive and Ivy EVERY time she is in town. She loves the Peach Bellini and has actually made me a fan as well although their white sangria (which is actually pink) as a perfect morning pick me up!   If you get a chance to visit Olive and Ivy I would STRONGLY recommend it! Best breakfast in Scottsdale. It is beyond affordable for how delicious the food is and how great the service is!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times now, so I think I'm finally qualified to review it. First off, I'll say that this place is gorgeous. They put a lot of thought and money into the look of Olive and Ivy. It's very fancy. Even the bathrooms are impressive - the stalls are like little closets with no way for your neighbor to hear you pooping or to reach under and touch your feet... you just better hope there's paper in there before you start to go. Also, the doors to the stalls are nicer than any door in any house I've lived in. I'm talking big hand carved oak stained wood doors... for toilet stalls.  Anyway - the rest of the place is opulently decorated and well furnished as well. There's a swanky yet sophisticated feel here. The food is above average - as are the prices - though I don't know if the prices reflect the quality of the food. They carry a decent selection of wines - having sampled quite a few, I've decided that the least expensive ones taste best.  The service wasn't great, but it was pretty busy. The layout here would be pretty confusing for any server - but combine that with low lighting conditions and you have a recipe for service disappointment. Our server on my last visit was at least very sweet. In fact, I have yet to feel mistreated here, so I'd say at least they have \"nice\" down.   This isn't my type of crowd - unless you're asking me for a crowd I'd like to see burned alive. But as with many great places in Scottsdale, you may have to bring your own crew in order to really enjoy yourself. This might be a good place to meet up for an early drink or a happy hour snack before heading out for the evening. It's definitely in a great location and like I said - it's pretty nice.",

My friends & I didn't make reservations at Cowboy Ciao so the wait was ridiculously long for a group of 9 hungry people.  We decided to take a walk around the bridge area until we noticed Olive & Ivy.  The music, lights, & patio was all it took to draw us in there for dinner.  My first thought?  Vegas ultra lounge.  There whole room was lit by candles & low-hanging lamps that appeared to drip from the ceiling like taper candles.    Most of the crowd was around the huge bar that encompassed the entrance of the restaurant or by their personal firepits in the patio so the restaurant area was open for my huge party to be seated promptly.  The free bread was so soft that I was surprised to find out it was foccacia.  It was accompanied by this basil/olive oil type of dipping sauce.  My end of the table had to quit after 3 refills because we wouldn't have any room for our meal.    I had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin w/ risotto & swiss chard.  OMFG...I was at a loss for words.  The crisy bacon with the juicy pork tenderloin combined with that barley risotto in some brown sauce was all it took to numb my vocal chords to prevent from wasting all that energy on talking, rather than putting it to use to chew & savor my meal.  Although I wish I had ordered the Nero d' Avola like my friend to pair with my meal, I had instead used my white sangria to wash it all down.  It didn't pair well but it also didn't overpower my meal, which was the most important part.  I completed my meal with a 'Spanish Fly' which is a martini with raspberry sorbet, Grey Goose, & some other juice that I really can't remember at the moment.  It seems odd to see the scoop of raspberry sorbet make its way to the top when the martini is poured but just one sip will send you to paradise.    Oh & FYI...I barely noticed the 'marketplace'.",

Josh P., our incredible server, gave excellent advice on the menu and knew the perfect balance for taking care of us without hovering.  The ambiance was perfect!  The bruschetta was outstanding... The artichoke \"small plate\" had great flavor.....the focaccia and pesto was absolutely delicious.  Then the main courses...we had three: the chicken scallipini, sea bass, and sweet potato cannelloni.  Every taste was a work of art!   Kuddos to chef Chris and his team of culinary artists...and to Josh P. for making the meal more like an EVENT.  We will be back!!",

On request I asked to sit by the open kitchen bar, even though it was closed at the time, they were happy to accommodate. Check One!   Got to the bar table and was happy to see busy chefs mastering different areas of expertise. From stone ovens, to open flame grills. The service was phenomenal. Our wait-staff, as it seemed, was great. There were several staff members to help with the menu and movement throughout the meal. Check Two!  I took our server's recommendation of the Egg Sandwich on croissant, with bacon, avocado and a side of fresh yogurt, berries, and granola. The sandwich came out perfectly; wet, but not runny. Check Three! I love seeing the EXTRA detail in service in restaurants. Example would be before my meal came out, they brought a spoon for my soon-to-be-eaten yogurt. Or the fact that there was another craft of lemonade. Check Four!  Having Verdejo Sauvignon Blanc wine by the glass. Check Five!  Thanks Olive and Ivy! I'll be back soon.",

Besides getting pooped on by a bird from the trees overhead, the pesto was yummy and bread was nice and soft. I ordered the Rosemary potato and soft egg flatbread that was delicious! My husband really liked his eggs benedict. My niece ordered the French toast and we all agreed that it really tasted like a jelly donut, In a good way! The Bloody Mary was fresh.

However, I've never had the pleasure of dining inside the actual restaurant until Friday.  The service, food, and decor are all top notch.  Although the price of my entree was ridiculous in my opinion ($26 for 3 shrimp atop risotto), everything else was excellent.  The bread and pesto they give you to start is phenomenal, the lamb meatballs are tender and delicious as was the tzatziki, and the shrimp and risotto was perfect as well.  The margherita flat bread was just ok and we should have opted for one not as basic.  Next time for sure.  My only advice is to either make a reservation or come early.  The place fills up fast around dinner time but 6:30 is a safe bet for early-birds without a reservation.  Also, the better the weather the more prime the real estate on the patio so get there super early to reserve your spot out there.",

The sangria is super refreshing and tastes amazing, I tried the red one yummy! They make all their bread in house so it's always fresh, you get a complimentary plate of bread with their signature pesto sauce and we scraped that thing dry. I love pesto though :) I ordered the mediterranean salad and added chicken ($14.50) it was very fresh and they put in just the right amount of dressing. Now for the not so good plate.... the Ivy Sausage Sandwich ($11) It looked and tasted like McDonalds sausage sandwich, super oily but what do you expect when it's sausage. I was expecting something a little more tasteful and classy for the price of the sandwich. Even the eggs looked like McD's eggs and it was under flavored, very disappointed with that dish. But overall, it was still a great experience, our server was knowledgeable and really nice.",

My other sister ordered Blue Cheese salad which was large and she said quite good.   Overall it was ok, for the price the portions were not up to par.

We came in from the storm in gym clothes and the staff couldn't have been kinder or more accommodating. The outside area of course was closed, but I really want to go back because it looked really comfortable. I would have given them 5 stars, but I missed the lunch menu which is only available till 3pm and seemed to be delicious food, more reasonably priced. We had the sweet potato cannelloni which was good, choice of (3) crostini which was also good, a chopped salad and lamb meatballs all good, for about $50, but they had our food out in record time. My 9-year old enjoyed it as well because the kitchen is all open and she said it reminds her of Hells Kitchen but w nice people.",

Paid $100 in cash and then the rest on my card....(50/50 split between two people)  Turns out the waiter took all the cash and charged the whole bill to my card.....took a long time to dispute it with the manager who for whatever reason was very hesitant to reverse the transaction until I threatened to file a fraud report with my bank.....  I read another review of a similar situation....seems like a real problem there",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best breakfast and brunch places in Arizona. Every time I come into town I have to go to Olive and Ivy as I used to live in old town and would go here on the regular. Now the items you have to order if you are a first timer or even a regular during brunch:  A pitcher of sangria (red is better than white but you can get them mixed). The sangria here is delicious and I have gone through pitchers of it here so be careful you will get a buzz without tasting the alcohol.  THE Breakfast Sandwich: I call it THE breakfast sandwich because it is THE BEST breakfast sandwich you can get in Arizona. It is on a crispy croissant and has avocado, mayo, bacon, and egg. I don't know how they do it but it is delicious no matter how many times I order it.  Appetizer: The trufulga flatbread. It's a flat bread with mushrooms and I believe truffles, and it is tasty, also their margarita flat bread is good too and even the sausage one is delicious.  Mediterranean Salad: This salad was also delicious, and although not as good as an original chop salad it is still delicious.  Also if you don't get bread REQUEST it before your meal arrives, their bread is fresh baked and comes with pesto and is delicious to just munch on just don't fill up. You can also ask for balsamic vinegar and oil as well but the pesto sauce is tastier to dip your bread in.  Again this is for brunch and honestly I have never had anything that was bad at this place.. EVER and I came here at least once a week for 5 years at one point.",

We were there on Easter Sunday, so they had a limited menu for the late afternoon while they switched from bunch to dinner. We asked Taylor if she could ask the Chef if he could fire up a steak for us even though it was an hour before the regular dinner menu started. She asked and came through for us. The steak was a perfect medium rare. We substituted the standard veggies for mixed veggies and they are cooked perfect as well. Taylor's service along with the food made a fantastic ending to the last day of our vacation.   The wine list is a medium size, but they have a nice selection.  Thanks again to Taylor and the staff for a great meal!",

The fritto misto was pretty standard plain rings,imo calamari should have the tentacles but still tasted good. Very lightly fried and flavorful  Felt guilty after and got the chopped chicken salad which was very light and flavorful while also being very filling. Had a very interesting peanut granola that accompanied it.  Got to try my friend's sweet potato cannelloni that was incredible as well.   Really great interior design.

    "text": "Mixed bag all around, but overall a fan.   Vibe - 5 stars. Really cool place, very modern with an open view into the kitchen and marketplace area. Loud music playing which is surprisingly pretty cool during dinner.  Drinks - 1 star. watered down old fashioned, damn near sent it back. Came stacked with ice and just overall disappointing. Ordered a beer and they opened the can at the table. Seemed kinda tacky.   Service - 1 star. Pretty miserable server. Asked for a recommendation and he listed 95% of the menu. Asked for more bread to have with our meal, he agreed and it never showed up. Asked for the heater to be turned on since it was a bit chilly and he proceeded to get annoyed and literally kick a chair out of frustration. Multiple tables noticed. Not a good look.  Food - 4.5 stars. Bruschetta sampler is awesome - the avocado and the mushroom are both excellent. Docking .5 star because the prosciutto was underwhelming due to one very tiny slice hidden under a bed of arugula. Veal and Spinach ravioli were awesome, incredible sauce.",

Scrambled eggs on top of a cheddar biscuit on the bottom.  The Iced Chai Tea Latte was prime. The only thing that took me by surprise was how heavy the whip cream was on the top of the latte.

The last place I had service that great was at Galatoires's Baton Rouge location.   I thought my first waitperson was exceptionally great, but then I had the same experience 3 times with 3 different waitstaff. Pleasant, friendly, efficient, discreet. I was beyond pleased. No annoying interruptions to ask me how my food tastes (fishing for compliments that add nothing to the dining experience) or to ask if I am done with a clearly finished plate.  The food there is great, too. I recommend the chicken pesto flatbread and the beet salad. They had a special gelato, cherry cheesecake, that I hope becomes a permanent menu item.",

On my recent visit, i sat out on the patio which felt like I was having lunch and drinks somewhere far from Arizona. The entire patio was nicely decorated and laid out. It wasn't over crowded with tables or anything. The service at Olive and Ivy was beyond great. Everyone walked around with a smile on their face and always made sure everything was going well with your meal.   I highly recommend Olive and ivy for anyone who is wanting an \"out of this world\" experience. It truly felt as if I had just walked out of Arizona and entered a tranquil, beautiful space.   I had one of their Grapefeuit Palomas which are fantastic. Please order one when you go. You will not regret it. They have a great list of wines and cocktails to choose from as well.   I will definitely be returning again soon. This place is amazing.",

But when comings with the other ingredients on the plate it was better but did failed to deliver a WOW factor for a main course.  After the great salad I was expecting the main course to deliver awesomeness. I was disappointed.  Would I be back..meh! Not sure someone would have to twist my arm!",

I tasted the artichoke appetizer which was no more than some canned artichokes on top of arugula dressed with balsamic and oil sprinkled with parm, nothing above average. For the entree I ordered the veal and spinach ravioli. The pasta was chewy, the filling was strange, it had what I think was raisins mixed into it and strangely no spinach. The sauce was very rich yet had little flavor. All I can say was I gave the place a try, I think once is enough.",

    "text": "After spending what turned out to be the best Thanksgiving of my life with the love of my life and her truly amazing vegetarian family in Scottsdale, I looked forward to continuing the holiday into the next day at Olive & Ivy. One would think that after a Thanksgiving meal of salmon (that's the extent of the meat that was served), an assortment of vegetables, and Gouda grits, I would be dying for some meat. Not the case at all.   The mall to which this restaurant was attached was bustling with half crazed Black Friday shoppers; however, once inside we were led into a private room that must have been designed precisely for our party of ten.   I began my meal with the heirloom beet salad with pistachio and goat cheese dressing, followed by the smoked salmon flatbread. They were both out of this world. The couple of bites that I had of my lady's sea bass with wild mushroom ravioli, Brussels Sprouts and roasted squash confirmed to me that this place will not disappoint with any dish that you might order. I caution you, however, do not fill up on the delicious bread and pesto that they serve with the meal.   The wine list seemed a bit eclectic, and I would have loved to try something new, or the \"kilt lifter\" beer, but my goal to get the body fat below five percent limited my drink of choice to Grey Goose on the rocks. Next time maybe.   Save room for a cookie or gelato from the adjoining marketplace. This restaurant has the concept of restaurant and marketplace nailed. It was for me one of my high culinary experiences with plenty of love and friendship to go around. I know what you're thinking. How will I get to five percent BF while consuming flatbread and cookies? Well, how much willpower do you expect me to have after three vodkas?",

Since none of us were from the area, it was so nice to have a long, private dinner. Our server MA (Mark Anthony) was great! He was personable, fun, and really knew the menu (we kind of tested him on the menu!) The food was fresh and delicious, and the ambiance was perfect for a great girls night. The manager came in a few times to check on us and thank us, and even brought us a round of shots to get the night started. I'd recommend this place to anyone in the area or traveling to Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Overall, this is a great date spot. My main attraction to this restaurant is the patio seating, especially this time of year.  The bruchetta is hit or miss.  I find the bread to be too crunchy sometimes where it hurts your gums to chew the bread, but the funghi has notably rich flavors. The prosciutto is average, and although the apple caponata was visually appealing, it was also average in taste.  The kale salad was refreshing and the serving size was large enough to split in two, but it could use more of the candied pecans. My favorite main dish so far is the veal and spinach ravioli.  I normally do not enjoy pasta, but the meat was flavorful and was complemented nicely with the light sauce.  The Seabass was poorly prepared.  Sea bass must be cooked properly, and this one was overcooked, giving it a dry texture throughout, but apparently that's the way the want it.  Next, they mask the flavor of the fish with a slice of bacon on top of the fish. I love bacon, but it does not belong on everything.  The sauce was also too tangy. Sea bass has a subtle natural flavor that should not be overwhelmed by a greasy chunk of pig.  Service was average for the FRC.  I'll be going back to olive and ivy for the ambiance, but I'll stick with the dishes that are easier for them to make.",

    "text": "I had never been to Olive and Ivy, I chose to take my mother there for Mother's Day. We usually try to avoid eating out on a holiday, but this special menu looked good on line, and we thought \"what the heck\".  Boy, are we glad we did!!  Service was superb! We had Mark Anthony as our waiter - yes, that is his name! In fact, he was so good that I said he must be a trainer - yes, he is!!  Food was EXCELLENT!! I'm making a reservation for Friday evening. I look forward to experiencing it non-holiday!  The only issue was the table situation. They sat us at a table for two that - no kidding, was in the middle of the walk way! We moved it a bit over and it made it a little better.  One of the hostesses came over and asked if we wouldn't mind moving over so they could fit a 4-top next to us - yes, we would mind moving over - we just moved from there because we were in the middle of the walk area - what did they do? They moved the 4-top around us to where they wanted us to move to and what do you suppose happened?  The table of 3 (very gracious ladies because they didn't say anything) were forced to sit in the middle of the walkway and were literally in the way of the waiters and busboys trying to get around them!! One woman was scrunched over by me to try to get out of the way! They are better people than I for not saying something!  Mr. Fox runs his restaurants like a well oiled machine, it would surprise me if he knew they were trying to fit in tables where they don't belong - especially since it truly hinders the guest experience! I'm not dinging them a star though, I chalk it up to a holiday.  Everyone knows not to eat out on a holiday!!  When we go this Friday and those tables are no where to be found, that will confirm my hunch!  I hope Mark Anthony is working on Friday night!!",

My favorite part of Olive & Ivy has got to be the stunning patio! Seriously, don't even bother sitting inside. The patio is worth it even in the middle of the AZ summer heat, thats how pretty it is. I always get the Margarita Flat Bread and it is to die for. My boyfriend gets the Veil and Spinach Ravioli and loves it every time as well (I can't vouch for this one though, seeing as Veil is not my thing).  I have only ever had one issue with any food I have tasted here and that was my starter from last night. I chose to start with a cup of their soup of the day - Broccoli Cheddar. I don't know about you, but when I envision Broccoli Cheddar Soup, I envision orange, cheesy soup with a ton of chunks of Broccoli. The consistency of this soup could be compared to water, no chunks of broccoli and was green! I have never seen green broccoli cheddar soup. Honestly think they just pureed broccoli together, added water and a little bit of cheese and called it a day. I would definitely pass on this next time it is available.   Other than that, our guests loved the suggestion and we loved it to. Will be back time and time again!",

I would suggest not putting the receipt in front of the guests at the same time as they receive their food. It gives the customer a sense of rushing and that they cannot order another drink or dessert.",

She was thorough, courteous, prompt, sweet, and provided such an special \"experience\" for all of us that we won't forget. We had a couple bottles of wine, and her bottle service was perfect. The bruschetta was to die for. She even delivered some shots for our table in honor of the bachelorette! She also delivered a second surprise... a dessert platter! We didn't have to ask for her to do anything \"special\" for our bachelorette... she automatically did it! That has never happened to me before at a restaurant.   She happily provided us some recommendations of places we should go to continue our evening, and I really can't say enough good things about her, the restaurant, and the service/experience that we were provided.  Thanks ALISSA!",

All of these items where amazing highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates! As far as cocktails you have to try the pomegranate daiquiri or fig & ginger mule! The location is right next to the mall and near the waterfront and we sat in the patio that overlooked the water! Love this place I'll definitely be back for happy hour :)",

    "text": "Loved this place!!!    My husband and I were in the area attending my family reunion, and this restaurant was recommended by a staff member at the Hyatt Place.   It was a short walk from our hotel.  We went around 1 pm for lunch on a Monday. There was no wait at all for inside seating and 1/2 hour for outdoor seating (we were in a rush so we sat inside).  It was a nice atmosphere both indoor and outdoor, and their bathrooms were also very clean and cool looking.  Our waiter was friendly and gave us good recommendations.  We started with the bread with pesto. This was the best pesto I've ever tasted.  I think maybe it had more cheese than most I've tried.    I ordered the butternut squash and spinach cannollini (sp).  It was absolutely delicious! I LOVED the different flavors I tasted with each bite, a sweet and salty taste - almond slivers, spinach, mushrooms, squash, butter sauce, etc.   My husband is a basic kind of guy when it comes to food, so he ordered the burger on toasted wheat bread (he does not like ciabatta and all of the other fluffy 'foo foo' type of bread).  He said the burger tasted fresh and it had arugula on it, not your standard burger.  The fries were also good.  My husband had a peach bellini which was delicious, and I had a red sangria which was also great.  When we were done, I decided to walk through the area with the gelato.  I ended up with 1 scoop of Oreo cookie and cheesecake gelato and another of blueberry cheesecake gelato.  Both were creamy and delicious.  This was our last dining experience before leaving AZ.  We had a great time in AZ and this was the icing on the cake.  I am SOOO glad we decided to come here!",

Highly recommend to anyone checking out Scottsdale waterfront for the first time or looking to try a new restaurant  We had the charred artichoke hearts w goat cheese and the asparagus bruschetta for an appetizer. She had the beet salad and I had the sweet potato cannelloni for dinner and we shared the PB mousse for dessert. Literally nothing we ate was even the least bit dissatisfying. In fact it was beyond delicious. Every last bite.",

Was very helpful when asked for opinion on what we should order since it was our first time there. Their flatbread was so delicious and couldn't have had enough of it. All the entrees tasted delightful, even the desserts were awesome . They even had a ice cream bar with many different and cool flavors! Prices was reasonable I totally recommend this place and would for sure be coming back for more date nights with my girls!!!:)",

I asked for my steak to be cooked medium well (although I prefer my meat more on the medium rare side but I was splitting with my sister) and when it arrived, I could clearly see the bright red meat clearly in the dark, looking inedible. I went with friends and we only deemed one dish acceptable. Do not be fooled by these reviews. Only recommend coming with friends if you want drinks and a cute place for pictures. Disappointing.",

Told manager and he offered us a free meal and coupons to other restaurants. We declined. He continued to follow us out side.  Had to tell him several times NO.    Guess they did not like that we were dressed for bike riding, even the hostess turned her nose up at us  Hey management- bike riders are local!   Can you afford such bad word of mouth from us?",

    "text": "Sunday brunch at Olive & Ivy started with a request for a window seat. As inviting as the patio looked, we were seduced by the comforts of indoor air conditioning. So modern are the cluster of amber lights suspended above the bar & attractive upholstered booths.   Our server was super enthusiastic about describing top sellers on the menu. I found his energy addictive (it helped me wake up!), but my friend found his over-exaggerated approach to be tiresome (like, can I just have my eggs with some peace & quiet, man!)   We ordered:  -- freshly-squeezed OJ: delicious, refreshing, sweet, lots of pulp  -- egg sandwich on a brioche bun for him  -- cheddar biscuit w/ scrambled eggs & sausage gravy for me: underseasoned on all fronts; gravy could've used a bit of pepper, eggs needed to be salted, biscuit was neither buttery nor flakey (more like mushy & starchy.) Side of potatoes were also blah.   Olive & Ivy's menu reads like a brunch lover's dream (& the Mediterranean twist doesn't hurt), but their potential has yet to be unlocked. Where are the exciting flavors to match your impressive decor & animated staff?",

Olive and Ivy has an indoor bar/lounge area and an awesome outside patio. Not only do they have a great wine selection, they also have a good selection of beers from Arizona, Europe, along with other domestic options.   You can also grab a coffee, salad, or sandwich to go, from their marketplace.  Great food along with a great atmosphere gives Olive & Ivy five stars.",

We had such a great dining experience tonight on our last night here in Scottsdale! We had an 8:30 reservation and arrived to have the table ready for us. They read our reservation request to be outside and they were able to seat us on the patio! The bartenders up front were so nice and they made us great cocktails while we checked in for our table. Our server Melissa is AMAZING! As soon as we sat down and were greeted by her, we knew it was going to be a great experience based on her energy. Melissa knew the menu so well and really set us up for some good decisions. We will definitely recommend this place to others! The music and vibe in the restaurant is fun and on point. The food and the drinks were excellent!",

    "text": "My wife and I went there last weekend for our anniversary. We had reservations for a table on the patio at 7:45. We got there at 7:50ish and were promptly seated. It was a very busy Friday night. It was one of those very cold AZ nights, so we requested our server if we could have one of those patio heaters by our table and he was back in 5 minutes with one. I would strongly recommend a table on the patio for a nice, quiet, romantic dinner. It tends to get very loud inside on the weekends and it might be good to hang out inside with friends and drink but for a nice dinner the patio ambiance is really amazing.   Now for the food and drinks - My wife got the ivy and ginger cocktail and I got the red sangria. Before the drinks came out, our server got us warm bread with pesto sauce and it was really good. Drinks came out fairly quick and I must say I loved the vodka ginger cocktail drink!! It was HUGE and had a nice kick to it.   For the food - we are vegetarians so that really cut down our options to few. Our server Ryan G. was awesome and I would recommend to ask for a table in his area. We ordered the sweet corn, red peppers and goat cheese flat bread and Ryan recommended the sweet potato cannelloni. He said the portion was big enough to share and he can even split it and get it in two separate plates for us to share. The food was out in about 10-15 minutes and Ryan was correct...the portions for the cannelloni were perfect to share and we both absolutely loved the cannelloni and the flat-bread. The cannelloni had a nice sweet/salty taste and the spinach/almonds on the top tasted amazing.   Ryan had also asked us initially if were celebrating anything and we had told him it's our anniversary. After we were done eating, he got us a delicious looking strawberry short cake (on the house), with fresh strawberries on a white plate that had a handwritten note with chocolate icing saying \"Happy Anniversary\" . We did not expect this at all and it was really a very nice surprise! The cake was absolutely delicious and it was the perfect way to end the meal.   We will definitely go back!",

Well, it is definitely the former but fine dining, mmmm, not so much.   On the bar, seen and be seen crowd, it is awesome. Dress to the nines because it feels like Vegas ladies. People look fabulous and you can people watch all night and not be bored. The drinks are stiff, damn expensive and well worth it.   The food...Denny's sous chef was cooking the night I was eating and was doing a less than slamfastic job. We had the calamari and it was deep fried and resembled calamari in shape only. I had the bacon wrapped pork and was extremely unimpressed. The bacon was thin and slim. The sauce was dark, syrupy and had no particular taste. The ceasar salad was pure Denny's. Cut pieces of iceberg lettuce with a mayo dressing and big croutons.  Strangly, marscapone cheese was  a common ingredient in many dishes, the sauces and the soup. Given marscapone's bland taste, I didn't find adding it to entrees that innovative or interesting. So, get dressed up, get your drink on, but given the location, the Scottsdale restaurant scene is your oyster, so dine elsewhere.",

It was cougar central in there so I held my date close because he's a few years my junior.... they were eying us like prize winning hogs, or a coupon for 1/2 price Restylane injections. It was insane. I mean people were noticeably discussing our arrival. These women were not even trying to hide the shit talking. So, mad props \"geriatric mafia\" at the bar. Don't hate!  The wine alone is what warrants 3 stars. Two words: Arizona Stronghold. High five for the local support.  As far as dinner goes, we ordered the Seared Scallops and Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with side orders of Mascarpone Polenta and Roasted Mushrooms. My date and I happen to enjoy small plate dining and the server was nice enough to split everything up for us so we didn't have to feed each other. The food was...... get ready for it......... okay. Yes, just okay. The quality of the ingredients were phenomenal but flavor wise it just didn't deliver. Don't get me wrong, I don't have anything horrible to say but sorry, not having something bad to say just isn't good enough for a $170.00 dining experience.   I will probably go back and give it another shot at some point. I'm really glad I went with my gut instinct and didn't order the Filet because I am a total fucking steak snob. I have a feeling this review would have read something completely different and dropped in rating. Maybe brunch?  P.S. The chocolate martini was sex in a glass....... like actual sex..... in a glass.  You figure it out.  :)",

The watermelon salad was an incredible medley of complex flavors - the red chili giving the watermelon, avocado and goat cheese some kick to offset the sweetness.  Very interesting.  We got the funghi trifolati pizza and it was just ok.  After the first wonderful taste of mushrooms, it was all very bland with nothing to make it stand out.

The menu had some vegetarian options, not a whole lot, but what i ate was really good.  The vegetable Crostini appetizer was amazing and the Hummus was not that bad either. I had the margarita pizza which was good, my friends had a pasta with chicken and they loved it as well. The sangria we had was ok, I've had better in Chicago.  The crowd was upbeat and lively, seemed to have quite a few out of towners as well, and the age ranged anywhere from college to seniors...price wise it wasn't the cheapest place but it won't rip a hole in your pocket either.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been a couple dozen times. Must be good, right? So we stopped in for a bite, and a pre-shopping cocktail today. There wasn't much of a crowd, and based on our experience, it is totally understandable. The food tasted just as good, leaving the service as the game changer.  I like to sit at the bar for my meals out, and I've been known to tip a shot of tequila from time to time. I'd even go so far as to say that there are no shortage of bartenders throughout the valley who know me well enough to serve me a chilled shot. No salt, no lime. EVER. Haven't had to use training wheels since the early 2000's.    I ordered a shot of Patron Silver, chilled, and before I knew it, the bartender was turning away, but I still said, no salt, no lime. He didn't acknowledge that he heard, so when my shot was served with salt around the entire rim, i assumed he had indeed not heard me. Not that big a deal, so I brushed the salt off the rim. My wife, who knows me better than anyone, said, wait! Before I knew it she had the bartender's attention, and asked for a saltless shot for me.  Here starts the slippery slope. Rather than believing the customer, our barkeep looked at me and told my wife that I had asked for salt. I'm sorry, what? I said, no, I asked for no salt no lime, to which he replied something other than okay. Basically calling me a liar.He rudely continued to argue the point  Excuse me, who the f*** are you to tell me what I said. Anyway, we were there, we were hungry, so on to faux pas number two.  We ordered a turkey hoagie to split. Having had it before, I knew it was enough for our desire to have a fairly lite lunch. I can name 50 restaurants that will bring the meal to you split in two on separate plates. Not at O&I today. We asked the guy who brought the food for an additional plate, and after he went to get one, the gem of a bartender asked, oh do you need an extra plate.  This may sound nit picky, and maybe it is. But we live in the Biltmore corridor, and there are just too many viable options for every occasion to have to put oneself through that kind of experience. Wake up O&I. You have what it takes, just show your customers a little common courtesy and respect.",

The sea scallop entree was not great, as the featured scallops were small and over-cooked.  They were served on a sweet corn polenta that was actually very good.

If you happen to be there, please try the Asparagus and Wild Mushroom flatbread with truffle oil and the Italian Sausage Polenta.  To this day, I am still  dreaming about it.  As it is in the waterfront area of Scottsdale, the restaurant decor is absolutely beautiful. No matter where you sit inside a hundred hanging lamps looking at bottles of wine or the bright green outdoor space with a fountain, sipping a glass of Cab in your hands, you will feel like a million bucks! I gave it 5 stars for their bang for the buck happy hour, $25 between 2 people is a winner to me. Perfect place to end my January vacation, especially knowing I have to return to the frozen tundra or as most folks know it to be as Chicago.",

    "text": "This was my second time dining there and my third time there altogether (the other visit, I had cocktails.)  I have to say, when I went 4 years ago, I was very unimpressed with the eatery. I felt like it was overpriced for the small portions served and way too dark. You might think that's romantic, but judging by how loud it gets, it was a weird dynamic for me.  This dining experience was far better (despite our server taking more than 10 minutes to greet us.) He made up for it by suggesting items on the menu and being diligent the rest of the night, and the atmosphere was a little more relaxed than I remember. What stands out most to me about the decor is the sprawling wine bottle display that goes up to the ceiling. I also like the pretty hanging lights and big bar that greets you as soon as you walk in.  For my first course of my meal, I had the hummus and pita bread. I wasn't a huge fan of the pickled onion on top of the hummus, but the hummus itself was good. The pita bread was a little dry, but it was nice to have a healthy option for a starter, and overall, I enjoyed it.  For my second course, I had handmade pasta, and instead of the veal ragu, I got a butter parmesan sauce to make it vegetarian. The sauce was so, so good, and you should request it, too.  For dessert, I had a coffee creme brulee with hazlenut biscotti. I really liked the taste of it, and it was so creamy, but I found it sort of odd that our table sampled many desserts, and they all came out in perfect circle shapes. It made me think they were all pre-made, and that was a turn-off.  Overall, though, I was very satisfied with the meal, though Olive & Ivy can get pretty pricey for average-quality food.",

Huge space with a lot of thought put into it...neat-o. The service was absolutely excellent, and we never had to ask/wait for anything.   Now the food... not too bad, but not amazing. We had a global group of visitors (Sydney, NYC, London, Chicago, Dublin) and everyone was happy with the choices, and what they ordered. Decent value for the money, but not overly memorable. On the plus side, the wine list was extensive and fairly diverse, so we were quite happy with that. The cocktails were creative, but all the ones I tried slanted a bit to the sweet side on balance (not a bad idea for mass appeal).  P.S. Cowboy Ciao was pretty accommodating.

It's very large and open, contemporary and easy to people watch... one of our favorite sports. We came after lunch and just before dinner on a Sunday. There was a significant crowd giving the time of day and day of the week. They were only serving flatbread and dinner salads at the time and we settled on sharing two flatbreads. I ordered the Pesto and she the Fig & Prosciutto along with a  pitcher of the white sangria.   We sat in the bar area in some leather couches and sofas that line the bar. Very comfortable but we could have done with a larger table being that there were only two of us and we had a hard time managing in a space that was meant for 4.  The Pesto flatbread was my favorite of the two. Roasted garlic cloves, lots of cheese, fresh tomato... what more could one want? The pesto was very good and gave the perfect amount of flavor. It was my ideal flatbread. The fig & prosciutto was good as well. It was a very unexpected pairing with fig, prosciutto, goat cheese and spinach. Being that goat cheese is one of my favorites, I felt like it was lacking. I probably wouldn't order this again but it wasn't tragic either by any means, just not exactly my taste. The white sangria was great. Very refreshing and an interesting combination of juices and flavors. I just wish that the pitcher wasn't more ice than sangria.   Our service wasn't fantastic nor was it awful as others have described.   Although I didn't order off of it the wine list was very extensive but it was also on the pricey side.",

They seat us right away, and I'm excited, as is Kiri my girlfriend as we have already read the menu. The place is way tricked out cool, in decor!!! but strike #1 very high celling's, making for an extremely loud dinning experience. However the booths are nice, the lightings very cool, but oh yeah strike #2, my eyes are pretty good as far as sight & I'm somber, but even w/readers & my led smart phone flashlight, it's still very hard to read the menu??? Now you must understand that I have an onion allergy and if you do??? listen UP!: Starting with the apps, everyone of them contains onions of some sort & can not... I repeat CAN NOT BE PREPARED WITH OUT? WTF??? On do second course salads: every dressing is made with onions and your ONLY options is oil & vinegar??? Oh yeah!!! YIPPIE!!! I'm having a blast! strike ###3, but it got better, now I digress, Assuming now that our sever knows the allergy exist, we attempt to move on to main course: first up chicken scaloppini I order, Kiri orders scallops, and my mom, like me, chicken scaloppini, 10 mins pass, server comes back, and states that my dish has onions in the sauce, I say ok....what can we do??? she shrugs... IDK???? I ask her to please go back and ask the Chef what they can do??? 5min later, she comes back and says: \"the chef say's all the sauces, puree's/grays have onion\", but still no word on what we can do??? I ask again, she say's IDK??? I'm like WTF??? please get me a menu so I can try and make another selection??? DuH! Now the table has been held up at least 30 mins??? Finally, she tells me I can have the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin on a bed of spaghetti squash!!!! YUM!!!! I ORDER! YES!!! 10mins later the manager walks up and says \"hi I guess there was a problem??? I say, no we got it worked out. I'm allergic to onions, but the server got me on track with the pork tenderloin!!! He said \"NO\" It has onions in the squash???? WTF!!!! many mins go by, he gets it straight w/a potato puree instead, which I was told had onions, GEEZZZZ anyone still keeping up? Because only now does everything go down hill. Plates all come, my tenderloin that I ordered mid well (that slightly pink about 160deg internal temp inside, is all pink and bloody juice on plate....NO! Kiri's scallops are4 tiny scallops the size of a .50cent piece three seared only on one side and one not seared on either side and chilly cold in the middle???? WTF!!! we have to send our two plates back for do over.... \"RE-FIRE\" meanwhile, they leave my moms on the table for 15min and she waits for our food to return, only to have her's go cold....WTF! YOU THINK A PLACE LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE PULLED ALL THREE PLATES AND RETURNED THEM ALL HOT TOGETHER? I'm in the business and just call them as I see them???? SAVE YOUR MONEY!",

It was a beautiful night so we had to take advantage of one of the nicest patios in Scottsdale.  We ordered the warm apple pie with a scoop of Nutella gelato.  I won't be ordering the warm apple pie again.  First of all they shouldn't call it warm, it was room temperature on the outside and cold on the inside.  It looked like a cross between a hot pocket and a apple pie you would get from McDonald's.  The Nutella gelato was amazing.  I will for sure be getting that next time I go back.  The other couple we were with had the ice cream bar and a scoop of cookies and cream gelato.  I didn't try it but they said they enjoyed it.  The hostess was great.  The service from our server was nothing special. He gave us our check after we got our dessert and never came back after that.  No \"can I get you anything?\" and no refill of our empty water glasses.  I've been to Olive and Ivy many times and I will go back.",

Our waiter was engaging and fun.  The entire kitchen is open to the inside seating area, which was awesome to watch.  We sat outside on the patio which I highly recommend; it's right on the canal and it was fun to watch the giant \"waterbugs\" on the river change colors throughout the evening.  If you're going to order cocktails, I suggest the Daiquiri No. 4.  The waiter suggested a locally brewed beer for my husband and we both thought it was one of the best beers we'd ever tasted.  Now for the food:  I ordered the sea scallops, which were possibly the best I'd ever had.  My husband had the chicken entree, which was good, not great.  For dessert we shared the peanut butter pudding, which was to die for, and the Napoleon ice cream sandwich, which was just fine.  The only reason I'm not giving this a five-star review is because this restaurant is LOUD.  It's surprisingly big and it was completely packed when we were there, which was a Monday night, so I definitely wouldn't go there on a weekend!  It's definitely not the place for a chill, family meal.  But for a nicer, trendier date night, it's an awesome choice.  If I'm ever back in the Scottsdale area, I will definitely try to get in here again!",

    "text": "This was my third visit to O&I, and the first time experiencing the \"brunch menu.\" Plenty of lunchable dishes, tho, so while my 3 yr old devoured the perfect thick pancakes with custard and blueberry compote, my wife and I enjoyed two tasty flatbreads - mine with prosciutto (bellissima!) and hers with short rib (get 'r dun!).  The serving size was generous, she barely finished hers and she hadn't eaten yet that day (we arrived around 2 pm), and I got to bring home 3 pieces for a nice snack later. (which she scammed from me!! lucky I love her....)  Everything was cooked perfectly, and delicious. The decor of the place is top-notch, making me feel like I just had my living room decorated by Vern Yip from Trading Places. (always love his designs) Lots of hanging candles, rustic furniture, and an open air feel with a large outdoor patio.  The bakery has a nice assortment  of freshly baked goodies (my son loved the gingerbread man cookies - and I must say, they were still warm and soft - best I ever had) and even gave me a free homemade biscuit for my \"best friend\" at home.   And the prices, though a tad bit steep, are very reasonable for the food quality. Lunch for 3 of us, including a glass of wine and a quenching rasberry mojito was about $60.  The service was just okay, not too attentive, and the waiter, tho friendly, committed one of my most hated pet peeves. As I've said in a review for Ernie's, you are NOT impressing me 1 bit by memorizing my order. Do they not give waiters/waitresses pens and paper anymore??? You could have saved yourself a few percentage points in the tip, if you you didn't have to come back to me 10 minutes later and ask me AGAIN what I ordered. Or say \"You ordered the..........(long pause waiting for me to fill in the blank)....\" Nope! (buzzer) The Jones Family gets a chance to steal!!!  To all servers. Please. I'm begging you. Write down my order. In crayon if you want. Tattoo it on your forearm. Whatever it takes. Just please don't come back to me asking what I ordered. 5 minutes after my meal, I won't remember you, and I won't run home to nominate you for a mensa membership. I just want what I ordered.

The three of us split a couple craft's of red sangria (one caraf = $10 one caraf = two glasses per person) Needless to say we were very much pleased with our HH choice this day.

My only gripe is that there was probably too much breading on the chicken, but overall it was very good.  Especially the sauce on the chicken.  It seemed to be a little busy with several 6-top tables all around.  Prices were reasonable and I was definitely full.  I'd come back to this place and try other menu items.  Pros=service, food quality, ambiance, proximity to other restaurants Cons=hard to find on my TomTom and iPhone maps apps.

Last Saturday I decided to give it another go. And I am so glad I did! I am a fan of all fox restaurants - but this one might take the cake! The atmosphere and decor was perfect for a Saturday afternoon. They had the restaurant opened to the patio and the weather was absolutely gorgeous! Also they had a small band playing music, which was great!  The waitress was a little uneducated about the food and forgot to put in our order for flatbread, but she was nice - so I'll only take off one star. And the food - oh. my. god. The grilled chicken salad was the best I've had so far and the pasta was delicious!  I plan on returning soon. I think this might be a new favorite brunch/lunch spot.",

I love the patio, it's nice and doesn't even seem like you are in AZ anymore. Only knock on this place is that the waiter thought he had free reign during our holiday party and kept refilling our wine like he was replenishing water. Endless wine with no idea how many you have had? You can derive your own results for how that nigh ended up for a few people.",

We even had our engagement party here in 2017. The staff are lovely, and we always enjoy the exemplary service. The food is from a scratch kitchen (open, very clean kitchen you can see) and modifiable for any dietary needs. The marketplace is nice to stop in for a cappuccino or gelato while out around old town.  My favorite is the kale salad, add shrimp, sub blue cheese for goat cheese, extra dressing on the side with a glass of Sangiovese or Prosecco.",

I wasn't even sitting in the middle I was at the corner and still was asked to move ( which mind you that's part of an open bar seating first come first serve ) , the bartender ignored a guy who was trying to pay his bill , mid way they had completely forgot about my burger as others got their food first than we did.

There's a marketplace and the fancy sit down one. My hubby was in the mood for breakfast, and Yelp suggested this place. We were seated right away, and the server took our drink order pretty quick too. We looked at the 2 sided menu, and guess what. No breakfast, only lunch items. Whatever. I informed our waitress that my hubby and I were sharing their lamb gyro entree(with potato salad), and my son had their burger(with fries). We also ordered their soup of the day. (It was kale, potato and burger soup) It was really nice of them to actually split the gyro entree into 2 plates for my hubby and I. The soup, the lamb gyro and potato salad all tasted good. My son loved his burger. The only thing is I wished I knew about the marketplace part of the restaurant. I'd probably would've gone there instead. (Prices were a bit cheaper in the marketplace) On the plus side, our waitress was very nice and attentive to us. Overall, it was a pleasant visit. I'd probably be back if ever in the area again.",

I have dined and lunched at Olive and Ivy dozens of times and most of the times happily.  Today was a disaster.  I hosted an out of town friend who had specifically asked me to eat at Olive and Ivy. A friend of his had made this recommendation.  When we arrived we were PROMPTLY seated outdoors as requested.  It was at least 10 minutes before our server, Richard, showed up at our table.  Full of energy he proceeded to get going.  The water was out shortly.  And then Richard disappeared.  Then when he reappeared my dining companion ordered an Old Fashioned. He tells me that this must be the worst old fashioned ever.  Next was the Manhattan. Same story.  So, are you guys just inventing new versions or just have lost the recipes.  Anyway, I was embarrassed and not sure I will bring my guests here anymore.  The food was okay. But not excellent enough for my friend to erase the memory of the awful cocktails he had been subjected to. FRC is a great company. But as they grow they must be mindful of quality assurance in menu and service.  UPDATE! Just about 20 minutes after I posted this review I received a call from Jimmy at Olive and Ivy who is responsible for addressing customer feedback.  This level of responsiveness is something I have never experienced before. Jimmy, you rock! I feel important, I feel you care about how I feel.  Sam's got a good team.  Thank you.  After my next visit I will update my review to let everybody know what the status is.  Cheers!",

We started off with light cocktails of white wine. Their spirits list is pretty impressive at Olive & Ivy, so are the mixologists behind the bar. You won't go home thirsty.   We ordered a bunch of things to nosh on.  Their flat bread pizza is still outstanding and the Scallops are delicious.

Daniel has the ability to take drink and food orders for about 20 people at a time, all in his head, without missing a thing. I cannot say enough good about Daniel - ask for him, he will take care of you.  Otherwise, the food was really good - bacon wrapped dates, flatbreads, ravioli served family style, beet salad and hummus.

They have these patio seatings with patio furniture where you'll still get waited on and it's just such a perfect seating arrangement! Along with all the seatings inside. The feel for this place is closer to mature like 20-30s. I really really love the set up and would definitely try to make this place a regular spot to hit on a random night. I went on a Sunday and it was still decently busy. I do rate this place four stars though because I had ordered a margarita pizza which I thought was not good at all. I actually didn't finish it. But I did order the melon salad which was three different melons along with goat cheese which I switched it for feta cheese and avocado. I did think the presentation of the food looked very nice and our waiters were rly kind. My boyfriend and I will definitely be back here often!",

Second you eat with your eyes first so peruse the deli while you wait. Third decor was very eclectic. A lot  of ideas for the home.  Let's get to the good stuff. Menu drinks did not impress. If you have a fav I'd order it. Next the bacon wrapped dates were yummy! Salads we delivered quickly. Our meals comprised of the spicy shrimp risotto and big eye tuna was excellent. The dessert menu was simply, but I'd head back to the deli for a pastry and to people watch.",

When I was young and single (boo hoo) I remember seeing Charles Barkley, Mark West, Kevin Johnson \"KJ\" and other Phoenix Suns basketball players out and about-everywhere, waaay before Olive and Ivy.   However, looks like ballplayers have found a new place. Last time I was here I saw Dan Majerle-and I heard a European soccer team was here...single ladies?!    The restaurant is dimly lit and modern but elegant and romantic.  Since this is Scottsdale, you could wear jeans and some high heels or shorts and sandals. I've seen men in here with Hawaiian shirts or golf shirts and shorts. Later in the evening I've seen the high heels and tight mini skirts and men with some dinner jackets so it depends on the time of day.  I've been here a few times and if you come for an early dinner you'll see family's.  In the evening, the bar has some standing room around it and on the weekends it can be standing room only.  I've been here a few times and it's hit or miss depending on what's going on in town (convention, golf tournament, etc.)  Dinner is on mark, since my review is a bit overdue, I can't elaborate but I remember thinking it was fabulous! It is a \"Italian\" restaurant but not the typical menu-more Mediterranean.  A huge outdoor patio is wonderful too.  I saw a few smokers out there so during dinner you could walk out for a smokey.    Drinks were a hit too, I had champagne-so you could plan for a Kir Royal and nice appetizer at the bar or stay for dinner.  A live DJ playing some great tunes has been here on the weekends when I was here.   Located next to Scottsdale Fashion Square across from Nordstroms. Don't miss it!",

(He should think of being a consultant to other restaurants which have great food but mediocre service.)  We started with the bruschetta, a trio of mushroom, fig, and mozzarella. Each was a happy mouth experience.   The chicken chopped salad was big and rich, plenty for both of us. It was topped with \"peanut granola\" for that salty sweet crunchy somethin-somethin. Yum!  The outdoor seating was a beautiful alternative to the blaring music inside the restaurant.   We will go again and recommend you do so as well.",

The patio is so amazing - right next to the canal, and covered in greenery, cute tables and chairs, and good shade coverage for that spicy Arizona sun! Our server was super sweet, friendly, and had some great humour - respecting the fact that we were deep in conversation, but still getting our order in reasonable time, and connecting with us on a human level too. The restaurant was quite busy, but I felt that he was still very attentive, and did a great job.  We ordered bread and pesto, and the hummus plate with veggies to start. Holy moly, guys. Holy. Moly. I got really into making pesto this summer, with bunches of fresh Italian basil being so cheap, and this was just as good, if not better than homemade (always a huge compliment!!) I also love making my own hummus and this was at least 5 times better than mine! We got a huge heap of hummus with yummy, warm pita, a great variety of veggies - cucumber, celery, snap peas etc. - all covered with semi-pickled cucumber, red onion, and feta. YUM!! You guys... go get some, stat!   For my main I got the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (as did EVERYONE else at the table, which says a lot!) and it was really good. If you pushed me I'd have had two more plates of hummus rather than the salad, but I would almost sell my first born for more of that hummus... almost. The salad was fresh, and I liked the mix of ingredients - they felt well balanced, and well dressed, but the chicken was a bit dry.   I had a great time at Olive & Ivy - it's a great place for a relatively healthy working lunch, and I'm sure I'll be back.",

    "text": "I came here during my stay in Scottsdale for work on a Sunday night. It happened to coincide with Spring Training so I was told that all the restaurants were much busier than usual. This is probably the reason that despite the many empty tables both inside and outside (they were all filled by the time I left), I was told there was only availability for one at the bar or area in front of the kitchen. I opted for the kitchen area and got to watch the cooks at work during my dinner.   The atmosphere is very chic, but the patrons were a eclectic mix of retirees, families and young partiers. The concept is Mediterranean, although I didn't see any traditionally Mediterranean dishes on the menu. The menu is pretty sizable with a variety of pasta, fish, and meats to select from, with vegetarian and gluten-free options marked.    FOOD: PROSCIUTTO CRUDO FLATBREAD (topped with rosemary potato and soft egg) - When I ordered this, I didn't realize the portion was supposed to be shared so it ended up being way too much for me. If I had just one slice, it would've been great, but it got tiring after my third slice.  BIG EYE TUNA (with charred scallions, snap peas, couscous & miso caramel) - I'm a sucker for couscous! I always order it when I see it on the menu so this selection was a no-brainer. The couscous and the snap peas did not disappoint. The Ahi Tuna was sesame seed crusted and was fine, but not mind-blowing. I wish it were marinated more to give it extra flavor.   The reason I rated this as 3 stars is simply because while the food was good, nothing was that impressive, especially for the price. Maybe if I came back and tried a few more items and drinks I would change my mind, but for now, this is just an OK restaurant.  I would still recommend this restaurants for groups because I think their outside patio area is lovely. The menu is also diverse and safe enough that everyone should be able to find something they enjoy. However, definitely make a reservation, otherwise you'll be stuck at the bar like me!",

I also ordered the gnocchi, which was really good, not amazing, but still very fresh. I think I might have been too full to truly enjoy it. The wine selection is not as expansive as I would expect based on the decor, but it was sufficient.   One note...for some reason I thought this place was going to be a bit smaller and quiet...not sure what gave me that impression other than the name, but it was large (i.e. the marketplace) and pretty loud and happening.

A couple days ago a friend and I decided to try it out for brunch and it was a beautiful place to just sit and have a conversation with great food. Our server ( I wish I remembered his name ) brought us a pesto and bread for an appetizer it was amazing but be careful you can easily get full from the bread. I order the sweet potato cannelloni - OH MY LANTA! It was so good! I love sweet potato AND I have a big sweet tooth so this was right up my alley. It had 5-6 sweet potato stuffed pasta with spinach, mushroom and toasted almonds to top off. I Highly recommend this if you like sweet food! And also my friend got the kale salad which consist of bacon, blue cheese, apples and candied pecans - I had a chance to try it and that was definitely delicious as well! Overall do yourself a favor and try it out! You won't be disappointed!",

By far the most flavorful pesto dipping sauce I've ever tasted. The bread melts in your mouth and the garlic pesto pairing is to die for. Then there was the spicy shrimp risotto and bone in ribeye that my wife and I shared. I'll start with the risotto. Flavor A+ however the consistency of the risotto was B-. It was a tad bit runny, but I still would highly recommend it as it was still a stellar dish. The ribeye, on the other hand, A++. I ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection. Honestly I would recommend having the risotto as a side option. Lastly, the service was great and the drinks were great. Over all experience excellent.",

They said Kaiser roll but what I got was something soft and delicious (similar to Matt's Big Breakfast's Five Spot). Eggs were well done, avocado was fresh, cheese was yummy and the highlight was the potatoes. The potatoes were crispy outside soft inside and decently seasoned. It was a lot of food for 7.50. Boyfriend got the 2 eggs and he was happy. While we were waiting for our food we caught sight of the french toast.. it smelled like cinnamon and sugar and they were three large thick slices along side some berry compote....next time.. next time...

Close to the \"water\" in Scottsdale, and in the spring it wasn't too hot to sit outside.  Service was very good and the menu is outstanding.  Kind of a tapas place with many entrees as well.  We had the bacon wrapped dates, lamb meatballs and kale salad with bacon.  All very good.  Want to go back to try the Spicy Shrimp Risotto.  Very good drink menu as well.  I had the Whiskey Sour Smash which was very good (though on the strong side, so if you order it, make sure you like the taste of whiskey).

Believe it or not, we even thoroughly enjoyed dining outside in the August Scottsdale swelter- their misting system works amazingly well.  Went with my daughter and two of her friends- and I totally loved this place! I liked the high ceilings, the cozy decor, the lighting, and the marketplace feel of the interior... Because of numerous raves on yelp, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. It's True, they are totally fabulous- not to be missed!   I had chicken scaloppini, which was delicious- perfectly prepared, and served with just the right amount of sauce and Mediterranean olives. The girls all ordered pasta dishes- raved about, and then subsequently demolished them. There wasn't one crumb of food left on anyone's plate!   The focaccia bread with pesto is wonderful, and they have a great wine list here. I had a glass of Syrah from Washington state, which was thankfully served at the right temperature and was very nicely balanced. We were celebrating one of my daughter's friend's birthdays, so our delightful waiter brought us a complimentary dessert- an \"ice cream bar,\" which had ice cream, marshmallow, and lots of rich, luscious chocolate. It was totally delicious, and reminded us of a s'more.  Olive & Ivy is a nice place to people watch- the patio fronts the waterfront, and reminded me of a sidewalk cafe in Europe. I will definitely be back- only wish we had an Olive & Ivy in Tucson!",

My brother in-law and I both finished the ravioli saying, \"OK, I wish there was more of this, I'm still starving\".  The server said that the portions were *big* and I felt that it was misleading. I should note that this entire family isn't full of extreme appetites either. The portions were just weren't entree sized in my opinion.  Would I come back here?  For appetizers and drinks, sure.

We came for lunch one afternoon and my wife decided it had to be our final dinner also. It was even better the second time around, made all the better by our server Jeremy. He was very attentive, gave great suggestions and was overall so pleasant we would come back here and ask to sit in his section. Definitely a must on a visit to Scottsdale.",

    "text": "A stylish and delicious option for lunch! We were lucky enough to be able to take advantage of their patio, complete with a little fountain, on a beautiful sunny day, and the yummy food and lovely service added up to a great experience. At first glance this place strikes me as a bit corporate, but at the end of it I felt that they really provided a unique experience.   Two highlights of the meal: the delicious pesto that comes out with their free foccacia bread, which must have a wheel of parmesan in each bowl, because it's so rich and wonderful. I also adored the asparagus, mushroom and white truffle oil flatbread, which I shared with the table and immediately wished I had gotten just for myself.   I also had the chopped chicken salad, which I found to be disappointing. First of all, there was WAY too much dressing on it, so everything felt drenched and a little wilted. Also, I was initially really curious about the granola that comes in it but I actually didn't feel that it added very much to the flavor and found myself picking around it.   I'd definitely suggest this place to anyone who wants some pretty classic salads, sandwiches and flatbreads with a little fancied-up twist!",

    "text": "If my mouth could marry a meal, it would wed the meal I recently had at Olive and Ivy.  It was love at first bite.  The fireworks in my mouth were poppin like my lip gloss.  But seriously.  My friend and I were torn between two meals - the scallops and the shrimp risotto.  So we did what any logical foodie would do and split the meals!  I almost cried when I tasted the scallops.  The combination of creamed corn, perfectly prepared scallops, and asparagus was a harmonious combination of deliciousness.  The shrimp risotto was just ok compared to the scallops.  I am sure that if I didn't get the scallops to compare against, I would have loved the risotto.    The drinks here are outstanding as well.  Normally when people refer to themselves or their significant other as a \"mixologist\" I chuckle because come on..he is a bartender, just say it.  HOWEVER, the people mixing up these cocktails get my approval to continue calling themselves \"mixologists\".  I had the daiquiri and my friend had some sour cherry thing.  The cherry comes from Italy and is the only real maraschino cherry out there.  None of that bleached, died, and injected with sugar kind of cherry.   The meal was a bit expensive, but you will not regret it!  I would recommend sitting outside along the canal - yes the smell of fish is overpowering (especially in the summer heat)...but nothing can beat the meal you are about to experience.",

But even better is their Happy Hour.  Great drink specials and the bruschetta is cheap for HH as well. While not as fantastic as Postino's bruschetta, it is still delicious.  I've also eaten here for dinner and it's outstanding.  The seafood risotto is unbelievably rich and filling and I wanted to lick my bowl clean.  The little cafe also serves delicious gelato and my favorite thus far is the graham cracker gelato. Wow.  Get there early for HH because the patio fills up FAST.",

The icing on the cake was when he gave me my credit card and called me \"Siri\".

    "text": "I went to Olive and Ivy on Sunday October 22, 2017 to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend. We had made a reservation for 5:15 for outside on the patio. When we arrived, we were told they couldn't sit us outside because they were fully booked by people who booked earlier than we did. Only a couple of the 25 or more tables were taken. The hostess said it \"is the calm before the storm\" and they didn't want to rush us. They seated us inside with an open door to the patio, quite a ways from the water.  We stayed for an hour and a half, in clear view of the many empty tables on the patio; when we left there must've still been 7 open tables outside. They apologized, but it was a disappointment as we'd come down from Prescott for a play followed by a romantic dinner by the water.  I've been to Olive and Ivy several times before and always before found the staff great, the food scrumptious, and the setting romantic on the patio. Not only did we not get to enjoy a beautiful fall night beside the water, but my kale salad had little else but kale in it (very sparse toppings--nowhere near what it was like when I'd had the same salad at lunch before) and my boyfriend's beet salad was really small--like a dinner salad, not an entree.  It'll be a while before I go there again. It seems as if their quality has dropped.",

It's gets busy so make a reservation. We didn't have a reservation however they do have some lounge seating so we were able to sit there with full menu   OUTDOOR SEATING AND BAR: They have a nice large patio with misters There are some stools around around the bar. I couldn't tell if people were just drinking there or also eating   SERVICE:  Excellent service, food was timed perfectly and they even split the dishes on separate plates (a friend and I shared a salad and entree) without us having to ask   FOOD:  The portions were quite large, even the small plates section.  The trio of bruschetta is a great way to start the meal. The Mozzarella was a favorite of the group  The BEST part of the meal was the Sweet Potato Cannelloni. Very flavorful and well seasoned.

The food menu consists of a few different bruschettas, flatbreads and a couple other small bites.   We chose two bruschettas, bacon wrapped dates and a flatbread pizza with sausage. Everything was really tasty.  The pizza was the perfect size for two people to share. And the dates, stuffed with sausage, were fantastic! I highly recommend those! All in all it made for a great light(ish) dinner.  Everything from the atmosphere to the food to the service was great. The only weird thing was that they have an air freshener on the tree we were sitting under that squirts out air freshener at times. My boyfriend got sprayed quite heavily at one point - yuck!

I had the salmon Caesar salad which was pretty yummy and oddly filling? Haha Or perhaps I was already full from the absolutely amazing basil/pesto/olive oil spread that was served with our bread. Regardless, it was a good-sized salad.  My fiance had the spinach and veal ravioli which was downright melt-in-your-mouth amazing. While it could've probably been enough for me, he arrived starving so he was still somewhat hungry after finishing his meal in a whopping 5 minutes.  Luckily we had the bread and he had some of my salad but I do have to admit it couldn't have more than maybe 8 ravioli pieces? And for the price, that definitely wasn't enough.. Hence the 4 star rating vs 5 star.  We'll still be back.. I love their patio area and wine selection, maybe this time we'll get an app for my fiance!",

I got a flat bread that was again mushroom and cheese and arugala. It was good, but a little burnt.

Always friendly, kind, and willing to go above and beyond expectations to provide excellent service! Brandon, Calay, Nick, Amber, Zak, John, Meca, Jake, Stefan, Dan, Zane, Easton, Jeff - YOU GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE! Every time I walk in the door, you guys are like family! (Sorry to anyone I missed!) Been coming here for years and of course the food is always ABOVE & BEYOND just like the service!   All of my friends and family that I bring in always feel so welcomed and rave about the incredible service. Thank you all so much! Olive will always be a top pick for me and anyone visiting from out of town!  Food favs: lamb meatballs, veal & spinach ravioli, chicken pesto flatbread, & mediterranean salad with salmon!",

We ordered the #19 and a Moscow mule. I didn,t care for my gin & tonic, but my wife loved the Moscow mule, especially the ginger beer. The Chefs seasonal board was excellent, with the blue cheese and bread as stand outs. After the Chef, board we decided to have  something light. I had a caesar salad with anchovies and my wife a kale salad with grilled chicken. I can tell you there was no doggy bag after dinner. The anchovies were so fresh and salty, i felt i was in Greece. The parmesan  was shaved perfectly and the romaine was very fresh. The service was excellent, even with the place being packed on a Tuesday night. Will visit again",

There was no yummy French toast, pancakes or even an omelette!  I ordered the eggs benny which was served dry boasting a teaspoon of hollandaise and was extremely underwhelming.    For lack of choice, my mom ordered a tuna salad sandwich for $14.  Really?  What respectable chef even puts a tuna sandwich on a brunch menu! ?  It was my birthday this information was in the reservation comments AND I INFORMED THE HOSTESS.  Not only did my server not acknowledge the day with a complimentary ANYTHING I wasn't even told \"Happy Birthday\"...  While I'm new to AZ, I know in my foodie heart that there's got to be a better place to dine as this couldn't possibly be \"as good as it gets\".",

Also, there's a lot of free parking in the garage next to it.  As we were on vacation, I decided to go with a pretty strong drink (whiskey sour smash) during lunch. My friend got the red wine sangria but sadly it did not taste fresh and she switched it with the strawberry and thyme cocktail and that was pretty good. We got the hummus to share and it was very tasty and I got the sweet potato cannelloni for my mains. The pasta was very thin and cooked perfectly and the sweet potato stuffing complimented the buttery sauce extremely well.  I think this place is definitely worth checking out if you like an extensive menu which is diverse and a great place that overlooks the water!!",

Both appetizers were really tasty and fresh but I loved the bacon wrapped dates the most. The complimentary focaccia with pesto sauce was also great! The pesto was especially good.   My husband had the chopped chicken salad and loved it. It was very hearty. I was debating between two of the flatbreads to try, and our server offered to do half and half for me. I tried the prosciutto crudo and the funghi trifolati and it was hard to pick a favorite. Both were very flavorful and perfect. My husband also really liked the Bloody Mary mix, which they make in house.  Everything about our experience was great and the prices were so reasonable for all the food we ordered! I will be sure to come back again.",

    "text": "I typically go to Olive and Ivy often. I even had my bridal shower at the restaurant in October. My friend wanted to eat here on her birthday which was on Valentine's Day. She had made a reservation for 5 people. Our server Bart was very nice, however, Heather, one of the managers, was EXTREMELY rude. She came over and she said that she had a reservation that had been waiting for 30 minutes for our table on the patio. This happened less than five minutes after our gelato and drinks had hit the table. I still had a full glass and half of the dessert left (that took over 15 minutes after ordering to be brought to the table). All 5 of us are in the industry, so we are all pretty understanding and we know how stressful it can be, but we would never speak to anyone how Heather spoke to us. She then went on to blame the late joiners, which was my husband and I. She was inconsiderate, loud and disrespectful. I told her we will leave as soon as we are finished with our drinks and desserts. At this point, we still haven't even received our split checks! She stood against the wall and stared at us for about five minutes and came over again with a male manager and said \"Like I said before, I need your table.\" (WHILE I HAD MY MOUTH COMPLETELY FULL OF FOOD.) We were all shocked in disbelief and completely embarrassed while other people at surrounding tables stared at the ordeal taking place. We asked to speak to the general manager and Heather would not budge until I had to demand to speak to the general manager. When the general manager Kim came over, we expressed our concerns about Heather's attitude. Kim went on to tell us that this reservation had been waiting over an hour for the table (when five minutes before that Heather said 30) and that they were busy, which is a good problem to have. One of our friends mentioned to Kim that we wouldn't have minded if we were completely finished or if they offered to move us to another table inside. We told the manager this and SHE STILL DIDN'T OFFER TO! We had planned to stay and drink more but we decided to spend our money elsewhere. The server even came by and felt the need to apologize for both of the managers poor reaction to the situation. As we got up and walked through the inside of the restaurant there were over 6 tables open. Needless to say, We will not be going back to this restaurant anytime soon. The staff has always been so friendly but there is extremely poor management. I left Olive and Ivy feeling embarrassed and disrespected, not how you want to feel after celebrating a friends birthday.",

I was in a large group that had convened for lunch there, and the consensus was a resounding \"Bleh.\" I ordered some raviolis that weren't bad to the taste, but three or four average sized raviolis aren't gonna do much for a brother who wants to leave somewhere not hungry anymore.   As soon as we left I was already looking for a second lunch spot. I have a big appetite, in fairness, but if you're paying eight or nine or ten bucks for a plate, it shouldn't feel like \"pre-eating.\"",

Great cocktails that offer combinations of liquors you wouldn't expect but they taste delicious. Their small plates are so uniquely done and meld such awesome flavors with the freshest ingredients.  The salads are some of the best I've experienced and the flatbreads are delicious as well.  The huge outdoor patio is so tastefully done - you feel like you are at your own comfortable outdoor abode.  I have to give a shout out to Tommy, our waiter on 10/28/14 who was the BEST!  He said he was going to \"take care of us and feed us\" and with his suggestions and help with choosing our small plates - he hit a home run!  His sensational personality and wit were all it took to send our memorable evening over the top.  Been patronizing this place ever since I first learned of it several years ago and hope to be for a long time to come.",

    "text": "We came here in February, so the outdoor patio was lovely. The service was decent but a little slow. The appetizers were good - we especially enjoyed the brushetta selection and the bacon-wrapped dates. The lamb meatballs were pretty bland and tasteless though. We were with a large group so there were a variety of things ordered. However, I ordered the tuna and it was too salty. I didn't enjoy the flavor at all. My husband ordered the gnocchi, and while it was pretty tasty (although a little too rich for me) - it was a TINY portion and he ended up finishing up the bread to have a whole meal. For the price, the general consensus was that most meals were too small. Someone else had the chicken though, and that was good. The desserts were good overall, but again not great. Most of us had a scoop of sorbet, and for the price ($1.75) that seemed a good deal and just enough to finish the meal. The table also ordered the ice cream bar and while it was tasty it was also rock-hard and difficult to cut even with the steak knife they provided. Overall this place is decent but I would imagine that Scottsdale has better options.",

But no drink order was taken.  When our waiter arrived - same thing - he brought bread & pesto - after being asked.  But didn't ask for a drink order.  Brought out the bread - still no order.  Came back out & took our food order, but...you get the idea.  We shared the 3-bruchetta combo which was fresh & tasty.  I had the chopped chicken salad which was just OK.  Too much dressing on it which overpowered the tender chicken & the yummy, crunchy peanut granola on top.  The table was cleared & cleaned but we were never offered dessert or cookies, pastries, gelato, etc.  Our waiter kindly split our tab 3 ways...which would have been much bigger...had he ever offered us drinks or dessert.  Decent food but if I want average, offhand serivce, I can stay in Chandler & go to Chili's and spent a lot less $$$.",

    "text": "Came here for restaurant week a couple weeks ago. I usually enjoy Fox restaurants, but for some reason had never come here before. For a starter I had the mini tuna tacos, which I thought were great. The taco shell was really crunchy which went very well with the texture of the tuna.  My entree was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. The bacon had a lot of taste, but wasn't overpowering and went well with the pork. It had a bbq sauce that had the right amount of sweet to it. What really made the entree excellent was the side dish. It was sweet corn with roasted peppers and tomatoes. It was great! Best part of the meal by far, and that shouldn't take away from anything else, it was just that good.  One reason I love restaurant week is that I get a dessert with my meal, which I usually don't ever order. I ordered peanut butter chocolate torte...so good. It came with a small scoop of peanut butter ice cream. A perfect way to end a good meal.",

    "text": "After discussing for a while different cuisines  and restaurants in Phoenix area, our niece's friend suggested olive&ivy for dinner. we made the reservation and found the restaurant after circling the shopping center couple of times (restaurant not visible from the street) we parked in the public parking and walked in the restaurant. As soon as we walked in we were awed, beautiful, spacey modern decor. we dined in the patio and it is beautiful there right by the canal, all the strings of lights felt like Christmas time. Ot was absolutely a delightful ambience.  Now unfortunately I have to comment about the food which needs much to be desired.  The appetizer, bruschetta, were ok, salad was pretty good but the main dishes were  disappointing.My spicy shrimp risotto was unflavorful, the risotto was like a paste and the shrimps had no taste. My niece ordered scallops and they had no taste either. same thing with the chicken dish my brother-in-law ordered and the sea bass my daughter had. We ordered lemon tres leches cake for dessert and unfortunately the have no idea what tres leches cake should taste like. it was too lemony and dry (it should be really moist with 3 kinds of milk). over all 5 stars for the decor and ambience, 2 star for the food, and 4 star for the waitress who was very knowledgeable and attentive and  patient. So it was mixed feeling but the sad thing is this restaurant has the potential to get 5 stars if they only improve their food quality. Oh, I forgot, my brother-in-law loved his entree (scotch with soda), no complaints from him.",

Open-air decor, eat inside or out next to \"waterfront canal\" (CAP water that people used to water-ski on decades ago, towed by a pick-up truck).  Not to detract from the review, but this is \"desert-rat style waterfront\" all dressed up in Scottsdale fashion - but that is the city's doing, not Fox's or Olive & Ivy's.  The restaurant decor and atmosphere are great.  Highly recommended.",

There were three of us, and we were seated in a half round booth with a view of the terrace/patio.  It's clean, modern and the service was fantastic; our server was knowledgeable and his smile was genuine, and since this was our first time there we all had questions which he answered cheerfully.  We started with the Humus plate, and the Humas is made from scratch (as is their bread and pasta) and it was the best I've ever had.  Never had scratch made pita before this, and what a difference!  One gal had the Mushroom Ravioli which she was thrilled with, my other companion had the Sea Bass which she adored.  I had the Shrimp Scampi Risotto; the shrimp was tender and perfectly cooked, and Risotto was creamy, delicious and melted in my mouth!!  Even their Iced Tea was wonderful!!!  The only negative is that it's a bit loud and hard to hear each other which made us all raise our voices.  If you're anywhere near Scottsdale, you have to go to Olive & Ivy!!!",

    "text": "This is a very nice looking restaurant...but it is in Scottsdale so I expect nothing less in term of appearance and decor.  My friends and I dine outside on a nice day in May so we could still tolerate the weather despite flies hovering over our table because we had the smoked salmon and halibut.    I heard about Olive & Ivy so so I was expecting superb dishes but it could be what we ordered because it certainly did not meet my expectations.    Smoked Salmon flatbread- I highly reccommend the flatbreads because it is delicious!  You know what else is delicious? Their homemade bread with pesto dip!!!!   I can eat this ALL DAY!   Marinated Hanger Certified Angus Beef Steak- it was ok, nothing really special about this dish.  Alaskan Halibut - this dish did not stand out at all. Cavatelli Pasta- this was a disappointment, I ask the waiter for suggestion and this was what he suggested.  Maybe i'm not a Cavatelli fan, but it was like eating dough with minimal spiced ground pork.   Go ahead and try- see if you agree with me?   So go for the atmosphere, drinks, and bread! :)  I highly reccommend that!    If you dine outside- you can see a little canal running through- so it is river side like dining.  Boojie ;)",

I had one of their sangrias and boy was it sure powerful, kinda on the pricy side but that's okay it was expected. The customer service wasn't great the hostess was pretty rude and had an attitude when asking us where we wanted to sit and our waiter was pretty foul too...look I know we aren't eating a full meal but a lot of people WONT jip you on a tip if you are helpful be a dbag  get a dbag tip..coming from someone who knows how the tip system works I won't be the one to dock you money for us nit ordering a full meal..get over it.   So do I recommend here:YES (didn't try regular food but desert won me over that I will go try it again.)  I hope that maybe they both were just having a bad day otherwise I hope you don't get the service we did.",

Sat on the awesome patio, quiet yet nice ambience. Our waiter was funny, timely and polite. My French toast was to die for.  Regular French toast then sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon served with berry compote. Didn't even use the maple syrup.  Loved it.",

I advise calling in a week ahead (or more) of when you are planning on coming because they fill up fast. If you aren't able to get a table we always love to sit at the bar or on the smalls bar couches around it. I strongly suggest ordering the bruschetta and the lamb meatballs! For dessert my favorite is their cheesecake. There is a new flavor everytime. But honestly everything I've had there has been amazing and Olive and Ivy is definitely one of my favorite restaurants!",

Hummus had a nice kick to it and enjoyed the warm artichoke hearts on arugula.   The patio is delightful except for one weird element: bathroom air fresheners nailed to tree trunks made the patio smell vaguely like a public bathroom. That made one conscious of the slight fishy smell from the canal and, maybe a little trash smell wafted through?  Not overwhelming but certainly mildly off-putting.",

It came with cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions on top. We really enjoyed it.   For my dinner, I got the sea scallops with sweet polenta and Brussel sprouts. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the polenta was a sweet and flavorful addition. It was a pretty light and flavorful dish.   I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.

My group of ~15 was able to sit in the private dining room with the beautiful round table- perfect little room with warm, romantic lighting. Our server greeted us enthusiastically as we entered, and never wavered in service the entire meal.  We were fortunate to be eating during Restaurant Week- most of us chose that menu since the rest of the menu was a bit pricy. Because I'd done my research beforehand, I had a decent idea of what I wanted to order. I'd never even had a date before but selected the wrapped dates! Absolutely delicious. My second course was the scallops, and I wish I could've finished it, but I had to save space for dessert. The apple spiced desert was one of the best variations of apple pie I'd ever eaten, all in a cute little serving jar. If I had to give Olive & Ivy room for improvement, it would be the drink specials. Not sure if the few I had were worth the $10-15 price tag/per.",

Our server was Angelo. He made us feel welcome and paid attention to us while we were there. The Marriott Courtyard Concierge recommended it as a nice place for a sit down dinner.",

The food and the staff are amazing. I've brought about 4 people to this place, each of them loved it as well.  My last visit was the best. I was surprised to see they have a Dj on Friday nights. It was a nice touch to the atmosphere. My waitress was very knowledgeable and even split our entrees without us even asking for it. We ordered the scallops and lasagna! Both choices I recommend.   Very clean Great service Entertaining atmosphere AMAZING appetizers and entrees",

Try the FRESH MOZZARELLA , ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUT, or the  PROSCIUTTO & FIG. In addition, I got the MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE which wasn't too bad.

The place is very near Scottsdale Fashion Square so the atmosphere is a bit more upscale, but still approachable- I've been here in jeans & a t shirt many times! It's one of my top 5 fav places for weekend brunch - they have $5 mimosas!! And I like that you get to pick your ratios of champagne to OJ as they do them table-side! The restaurant is very large and get a bit noisy at peak times but is a cool vibe! Also good for large crowds and groups dining!",

With my fiance, girl friends, and solo when I'm taking myself out to a fancy date :P. The ambiance is everything- I really like the music, the lighting, the decor. They have a nice bar with two TVs,and across from it,little community tables which are all open seating. The restaurant is quite large and there's plenty of seating inside and outside as well. The view whilst sitting outside is really pretty- they often have lights, you can see the bridge and canal, etc. The crowd is all ages- I love that everyone dresses up and makes an effort- whether it's families with toddlers, first dates or a group of friends. On weekends I think they have a DJ. I typically always get the all natural chicken and lamb meatballs- they're delicious. I've tried the flatbreads, and other chicken (can't remember the name) those were all good too. Their deserts change but all have been really delicious. The wine selection is ok, beer not so much, but the cocktails are pretty tasty. They also have a bakery/market at the other end with gelato. The bathrooms are always clean and the service is good. My only complaint is that they've started being a little stingy on their portions- dining in and take away. The wine pour is also small! But overall, still my top few places in Scottsdale.",

Don't get me wrong it was really good, but after trying my friend's sangria I could't help but wish I had gotten it! Safe to say, I will be getting it the next time I come in.... So yummy.   Please note: if you've never been to Olive & Ivy, the one thing you HAVE to ask for is the bread and their fresh made pesto. It will change your life - I swear! It pairs so wonderfully with all the other entrees and a glass of wine! For my entree, I ordered the veal ravioli. I will say... For the price, I was a little disappointed in the portion size. But it was so tasty it didn't matter much to me! It's smothered in this buttery sauce with parmesan. INSANELY good, people! Our server was also great in every way! Come to Olive & Ivy for any occasion!",

It doesn't open until 10 on the weekend so there is usually a short wait because every other Scottsdale native is waiting 40 minutes for breakfast club or some long line down the street. I highly recommend their mimosas ($6) they're huge and they actually fill your glass with good champagne, not just orange juice. The Mediterranean salad is my favorite dish and their hummus is my favorite starter. If you're looking for a quick breakfast, check out their market next door! Dinner is a bit more expensive and I don't recommend the paella only Because the rice was undercooked last time that I was there. Park at Nordstrom's lot across the street.",

He took such great care of us, never once let a water glass go empty, made sure our cocktails kept coming, and paid close attention to our few friends with food allergies. We all enjoyed the appetizers, our mains, and dessert. I can't remember what everyone else ordered... but I do recall ordering the artichoke hearts, lamb meatballs, and bacon wrapped dates to start with.  Did we enjoy them?   Uh - yah... I would say so as there wasn't a crumb left on the plates, haha. For my main, I ordered the shrimp scampi risotto.  Those who know me well, know that I love risotto so ordering this dish was no surprise.  Plus, I needed to eat something hearty that would soak up the alcohol once we entered Scottsdale's \"entertainment district\", lol! Anyway... I really enjoyed my dish and have no complaints.  I would definitely return to Olive & Ivy the next time I'm in Scottsdale.  We all had a wonderfully delicious time here!",

The place is huge, and we were seated right away.  The service was beyond 5 stars. The server was very nice and attentive. Food came out very timely and they kept filling our water even though we stayed there for a while to chat. They never complained or seemed like they were pushing us out. On top of all that, the waiter brought us 2 separate checks without us even asking!  I got the scallops and I was obsessed with every part of the dish. Some of the best food I've had in a while.  Would highly, highly recommend!",

Ever since they raved highly of this place and made it a must try when we came to visit.  We called the day before to reserve a table. When we arrived we were immediately sat at our all ready table. Our server was nice throughout the dinner. We started with a mozzarella appetizer and the bacon wrapped dates. Both were so satisfying. We loved the bacon wrapped dates so much we ordered a second plate of them. We ordered a bottle of the Riesling Champagne which was very smooth. Easy to sip and offered so many taste elements.   I ordered the chicken scallopini. It was lightly breaded and cooked perfectly. The chicken laid on top of a bed of flavored spinach which complimented the chicken nicely. My girls both got the mac n cheese which was very cheesy and perfect for both my girls. My hubby ordered the sea scallops which is definitely out of his normal ordering. My dad raved about it so he got it and said it was the best scallops he has ever had. They were really good! They knew how to perfectly season and cook them.  Their complimentary bread was a hit as well!",

It was my favorite part of the weekend! The atmosphere is fun and upbeat and the restaurant itself is beautiful! We had a reservation and were seated in a corner of the patio immediately on arrival.  The servers were attentive but not overbearing. They gave us free lemon drop shots for the group at the end of our meal in honor of the bachelorette!  The food and drinks were good - we tried every bruschetta for the table! My favorites were the prosciutto, manchego, and avocado! I got the shrimp risotto for my meal and it was delicious but a little heavy. My strawberry and thyme cocktail was very refreshing without being too sweet.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",

    "text": "[RESERVATION] I had been meaning to go here for a while. However, when I came with my parents for dinner, the hostess told us the restaurant would have an opening two hours later. When I came here with friends, some time later, they told us the same thing. Long story short, you should make a reservation. I was able to get a table for a Sunday night when I called two days before having dinner with my family.  I don't think the Olive and Ivy sign does the restaurant justice, because it makes it seem like the usual casual, chain restaurant. However, the inside is great (just a tad too dimly lit). There are jars with lights in them hanging down from the ceiling and a view of the river(?)/creek next to the restaurant. It is kind of loud as well.  [APPETIZERS] We were served complimentary homemade focaccia bread and pesto sauce. For appetizers, we ordered \"Choose 3 for $11\" bruschetta and Kale Salad [$11]. The butternut squash was my favorite. The prosciutto and fig was also very good. The amount that they give you for the salad is pretty filling. I think this is good to share because I feel like I would become bored with it if I just ordered that for myself.  [ENTREES] The Prosciutto and Marscarpone Tortelli [$16] doesn't look well put together. I was actually disappointed by the presentation when it first came out because it doesn't look like it will taste good. However, it tastes amazing. The sauce used in this dish is great to dip bread in.  My brother ordered the Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin [$24], which was amazing. I don't usually order pork because I fear it will be tough and not flavorful, but the bacon definitely was a great addition. I don't know what they did to the brussels sprouts but whatever bad taste they left in your mouth the last time you decided to give them a chance will go away once you try these.   Shrimp Risotto [$25] was good - my dad really liked it. I'm just not much of a risotto person - I think that's what I'm starting to realize about myself. But if risotto is what you like, then you won't be dissatisfied.   My mom ordered the Pacific Sea Bass (I think). I thought the presentation for this was well done.  [DESSERTS] Desserts I would suggest that you get elsewhere. I mean, they were okay, but nothing amazing. We ordered the bread pudding(?) that comes with a scoop of ice cream and lemon blueberry cake.",

So we decided to. check this place out last minute for a little treat thinking it was the same as IVY down in Chandler. We got there to realize this is a different place.  atmosphere is cool, and the location is nice. Overall vibe is good.   We ordered One of the flatbreads and it was good, but kind of high priced for the almost nothing that was on it...   We ordered next the 3 piece bruschetta and were surprised at how small the serving size was. The salmon lox was more of a patte/paste rather than tasty salmon on top. It was not bad, but its only a couple tiny bites and it is gone. We order this type of food often and there is usually a bit more for serving size.   The complimentary bread and pesto is the best part as it is actually DELICIOUS! But nobody every brought us refills for it so most of the tasty goodness was lost to the garbage due to no more bread....   All in all there is nothing exceptional about our experience here other than the atmosphere. Meager portions of the bruschetta are pretty unappealing and the flatbread just didn't have much going on...",

We became Scottsdale wanderers and became lost in the shiny retail-roads of old town.   Eventually we found our way to the canal, only made obvious by my recent Yelp excursion to a nearby eatery.   We took in the noon-time sights: art, people, etc. I perused Yelp for a decent late lunch and O&I was top of the list. With the gorgeous canal views I can see how it would be!  We ventured near and requested an outdoor table. Unfortunately our table was Also a favorite hangout for a local bird (apparently a protected bird). My BF and the bird became instAnt mates - much to his dismay. A few encounters later we were ushered to another table. FYI we named the bird Pippy (aka Poopy).   The views and weather were fantastic. Roughly 75* and breezy we could not have asked for better weather. The art installation at the canal made for an even better view.   Our cocktails were fantastic. A Fig mule for me and a apple/jalapeno margarita for him. With just the right blend of flavors and alcohol we were pleased. Plus the price was right (or maybe that's our SoCalroots showing).   I had the salad - which after reading a local CM's review I wish I would have ordered the warm chicken. The BF has the Tuna sandwich, which was a tad lackluster.   My salad had hefty amounts of bleu cheese which is always appreciated, but I do wish the choice of warm chicken versus cold was made more apparent.   We also ordered desert - lemon pudding cake. I found myself enjoying it, however not loving it. I did, however enjoy my fresh espresso - even thought it was received after we had finished dessert. Graciously, the server removed the espresso from the bill. Thank you for that!  I would not hesitate to visit O&I again as the atmosphere and service are five stars in itself.",

You can never go wrong with the bruschetta. I'm a sucker for salmon lux so that is certainly my favorite, but I was pleasantly surprised by the asparagus! It was the perfect amount of crunch. I went for a light meal with the beet salad, but I also tried the sea bass which was simple incredibly. Cooked to perfection, it melted in my mouth! Ended the night with strawberry shortcake, my favorite on the menu. Solid food and setting.",

And, MY GAWD IT WAS AMAZING.   This place was so freaking good we came for both brunch and dinner. The bomb!!!  Ok dinner I ordered the scallops and bruschetta. Excellent. Brunch I split with others and got the breakfast burrito, cinnamon roll latte and cinnamon roll french toast, shortrib flatbread. My lorddddd  Best way I can relate this to people is if you've ever had republique in LA, this is scottsdales republique. Which basically is an amazing compliment. A MUST GO.

Let's just say this was a lot of food, brought home leftovers.  Bruschetta trio - prosciutto, sweet potato and Manchego. My favorite was the sweet potato, loved it with the crispy brussel sprouts. Next up a split kale salad, which was huge split!  This salad alone is a meal for sure. And then had the sea bass. Delish!  Very flavorful. Took home some olive oil cake. Topped it all off with a bottle of Rose. Great ambience here, very energetic.",

I wouldn't really say it's the best place to go but for food but the atmosphere is great.  Any seat you take is fun and inviting.  Open seating outside by the water is relaxing and so is the seating inside the giant space that they have.  The service can be a bit slow when it gets busy.  Overall might be a spot to stop after shopping or a glass of wine between walking around the area.",

Our favorite waiter remembers to bring out separate dishes for the pesto dip (delish!).  It really is the little things that make a place stand out!

We have sat outside which I prefer but this visit we were inside in a booth however the entire from of the dining area opens to the outside. Service was excellent and attentive. We ended up with 4 different dishes between my girlfriend and I. We started with bacon wrapped dates, good! Then the beet salad which had a wonderful variety of flavors. We shared a piccante flatbread which was great. Finally we had the mushroom Tortelli just because we had already ordered it. Despite being full from the previous items it was still fantastic. We shared a fairly cheap bottle of wine though they have a fairly large list to choose from. Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the venue. Easy reservations and had great service.",

    "text": "Maybe I'm a little partial because I helped open the coffee/gelato area way back when but after a few years hiatus, I'm glad to say Olive & Ivy is still spot on, if not, better.   My family & I came here for my birthday dinner & the hostesses were friendly and had no problem seating my mother & I even though the rest of the party wasn't with us (I know that some places are really finicky about that so it was nice to just be seated with no hassle).   Our waitress was great from the get go. Her name was Andrea I believe? She was very friendly without being too over the top & paid attention to details even going so far as to offer to have my niece & nephew's spoon & fork that they have with them whenever they go out rinsed off in the back (I know of places far less nice than Olive & Ivy who wouldn't even do that so it was major points).  We started off with the hummus with veggies that had a kick to it...pretty damn good. The bread with pesto is ah-mazing!! I probably (definitely) should have refrained from having as much as I did as I was stuffed by the time my meal arrived. After the hummus, I had the half portion of the beet salad with goat cheese and pistachios...pretty solid trio of ingredients on top of the arugula and it was yummy!  Following that, I ordered the flatbread; half Margherita half prosciutto/egg/potato and while I wasn't sure how that latter half would taste, it was good. I'm a sucker for prosciutto and theirs is no joke! I couldn't finish it (surprise surprise) but I still ordered desert...it's my birthday, what better day to treat yourself?! The ice cream bar that's been previously mentioned is SO good...coffee ice cream with marshmellow and a chocolate coating with some peanut butter thrown in for good measure.   I have to say, as well, that the cappuccino was amazing   Well done, O & I. I will definitely return sooner for happy hour!",

The food was delicious and they gave us a complimentary dessert for a special occasion. They even let us pick from the dessert menu ourselves instead of giving us a chocolate something like most restaurants do. You don't have to spend a lot of money here but also you can very easily spend a lot of money here. I would definitely come back on a regular evening, not just a special occasion.",

Quite pleasantly surprised to discover this airy, spacious resto-lounge in Scottsdale Fashion Sq. Stopped in during happy hr. on a Thursday, decent mix of patrons. Overall space is versatile and occasion-friendly, great alfresco feel as giant oak doors were opened to the outdoor patio.  Lounge is perfect for small parties with low couches and leather sofa chair seating.  Great happy hr. specials (M-F 4-6pm) $5 small plates, well drinks, house wine, sangria.   Prosciutto bruschetta w/crescenza cheese, arugula & fig preserves was perfectly balanced. Italian sausage flatbread w/pequillo peppers & goat cheese - the peppers and goat cheese made this flatbread, the sausage was overly crumbled and didn't add much flavor. The cheese plate was fine - a mild blue and a mild Spanish cheese, plated with thinly sliced apples, marinated in a fruit jam.  Apparently, they're serving a $20 3-course prix-fixe w/several interesting options through 10/31. Menu here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxrc.com%2Fdownloads%2Fmenus%2FO%26I_Prix_Fixe_Menu.pdf&s=cb1a937a6b89dfabbb2fa013f54613126977e7e0c25d5f9b0569d0e9fbc23e14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foxrc.com/downloads/menu...</a>  Cons: White (pink) sangria was prettily presented sugar-rimmed, but served sans fruit (odd). Have had much better sangria. Service was spotty but potentially b/c bartender was doubling as our server, other servers ended up busing our table and were helpful.  Look forward to checking out other Fox concepts True Food Kitchen and Zinburger.",

It was a bit odd starting with bread and pesto and then eating breakfast but that's what you get when you sit down and the pesto was just so good! As for my meal, I had the french toast which came with delicious compote and warm syrup. This was probably the best french toast I've ever had that wasn't home made. Add a side of crispy applewood smoked bacon and I was in heaven. If I only come back to Olive & Ivy for brunch I'll be happy but I hope to make it back for lunch or dinner sometime as well.",

They need to step it up in this area. They could learn a few more twist on different ways to serve up a really great Martini by Venturing out side the box... Food was wonderful. Everything was cooked from scratch... From the flat breads, to the Turkey grinder. My Mediterranean salad was ok, not the best and could have used more ingredients (dated, currents, chicken, curry, other spices to take it to the next level). The restaurant sits on the river so the ambiance was nice...  They still need some work in the creativity department. They own many other restaurants through out AZ and rest of the  Country. Maybe they should think about hiring me as a consultant to kick it up to the next level.... If there was my creativity then just the standard mix of food, I would have given it more stars. $5 dollars for s tiny piece of bruschetta with, cheese prosciutto and they forgot the fig jam was a bit much. Messed up the drink order... But the experience was pleasurable. The waiter did his best, but they others fell short... The mixologist behind the bar could use some more experience and should learn to kick it up a notch... Chef as well. May be too many balls in the air that they are trying to juggle!",

Overpriced and very LOUD.  They have a little side deli/market where we go for delicious gelato and will continue to go but we will not go to the restaraunt again.",

I had the goat cheese tortelli pasta and my boyfriend had the steak and they were both delicious. The steak was a little on the expensive side but worth it. Patio is a nice atmosphere and the cocktails are unique and delicious. Overall we were both impressed, and my boyfriend is very picky! And the bread and pesto is great too.",

    "text": "I went here tonight for my boyfriend's birthday (11/11/11). First let me say the five star rating was for our waitress Andrea. She was amazing. The atmosphere was great...a little loud but died down after 11pm.  Andrea was very prompt, polite, and quick to make recommendations (which were all great). I asked if they could make a chicken alfredo dinner because I didn't see it on the menu and they were more than happy to accommodate, making the alfredo fresh! At the end of dinner I asked Andrea if she could do something for my boyfriend's birthday and without question she quickly brought a strawberry shortcake to the table. Tasted amazing and she even comped the price of dessert. If it weren't for Andrea I'd have given a 4 star review only because it was slightly pricey.  Overall food and  atmosphere were great, but the service was exceptional! Thanks Andrea for making our night special!",

Service excellent, although on a Sunday there were several screaming children and very loud large groups, but that's expected when you eat out so can't complain too much.  If you are a fan of pesto, you will be pleasantly surprised to taste the complimentary pesto w/warm, fresh bread.  I could have just ate that all afternoon! Delicious!  I ordered tomato bisque which was the absolute best tomato bisque ever!  If I were in the area I might try this place again, although there are so many other nice restaurants in the area I've yet to try that I'd probably opt for one of those.",

The deserts were all $5 and I had Neapolitan ice cream cake which was one of my favourite desert I have ever had . .

The bread was delicious, as all the reviews state.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates and the veal ravioli.  The bacon wrapped dates didn't really have much flavor to it.  The texture was great - crispy bacon around a soft, chewy date...but there needs to be some sort of sauce with this to bring out the flavors of the dates.  The veal ravioli was a fail - twice.  The first time they brought it out, the center of the ravioli was cold!  The sauce was warm and quite delicious.  I sent it back, (service was extremely polite), and when it came back, the food was hot, but the pasta shell of the ravioli was undercooked and hard.  I didn't want to send it back a 2nd time, so I just ate it.  The drinks were good - I had a pitcher of white sangria, and some wine.",

Obviously, the restaurant holds lots of sentimental value to us, and I love that.  I also love the food and wine menu.  We've tried many of the entrees, including the Braised Short Ribs and Rack of Lamb, all of which were outstanding.  We've also ordered many of the red wines, and always enjoyed our selections.  Nearly everything on the dinner and wine list is pricey, but it's also worth it, so go there when you can enjoy it.  The big BUT I have to include here is that we've had both exceptional service and terrible service.  On at least three or four occasions, our service was fast and friendly, just what you want.  The last time we visited Olive & Ivy was for our one-year wedding anniversary.  I called ahead, made reservations, and told the hostess over the phone what we were celebrating and the fact that I had proposed to my wife there as well.  Once there, no one ever wished us a happy anniversary, and we were sat in, possibly, the worst location in the restaurant, adjacent to a door (in January) that was constantly being opened and closed.  It actually looked like the table was placed there at the last minute, because no one would ever want to sit that close to a cold drafty door in January.  Not only that, but our server was unfamiliar with the wine list and couldn't give us any recommendations on appetizers (she said everything was good).  Hopefully, that one bad server is no longer there, and everything is back to the way it was.  If so, I'd recommend Olive & Ivy to anyone!",

We split a salad and a flatbread and a cheese plate - all were awesome - we wanted to try everything. Then 2 folks had scallops and for the non-seafood folks they had the veal ravioli - all were excellent - what we loved was they they split the plates already between us so there was no reaching over or fighting over the last piece  We will be back !",

Service was wonderful too.  The homemade foccaccia with pesto was scrumptious!  I think a lot of us filled up on that before our entrees were served.  Some of the dishes ordered: cinnamon french toast (yummyy!!); flatbreads (tasty); frittata (not too heavy, eggs cooked right); egg sandwich (pretty good); steak and eggs (wonderful!).  A few people also ordered drinks and I didn't hear any complaints.  In the front of the restaurant you can also order pastries and they have gelato too.  We were too stuffed to try any but everything looked good.",

The food was a bit inconsistent, though. The bruschetta was cold -- flavor was good, but would have tasted better hot.

    "text": "I have a couple of issues with this place, so I will start with the food first. Myself and my wife met a couple friends here for brunch last weekend. I made the mistake of ordering the \"Potato Hash\", which turned out to be one of the worst things I've ever eaten period. It's a simple breakfast of eggs over easy, sausage gravy and hash brown potato's. My plate came out with two eggs that had been cooked so long that they were both hard and dry. There wasn't a lick of moisture left in them. The server noticed that the eggs were ruined, and promptly had more made for me. The sausage gravy was terrible. It was some weird super oily concoction that neither resembled gravy nor sausage, which made my burnt potato's even worse. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. My second issue was my reservation. I made a reservation three days in advance for 11:30am on the patio through \"OpenTable\". The day before my reservation the restaurant called to confirm everything for the next day. When we arrived, the hostess quickly seated us inside. I explained that my reservation was for the patio. She told us to wait and she would go find out. Several minutes later she came back and informed me that since I made my reservation through \"OpenTable\", that my request couldn't be honored. WTH? I was told that if you want to sit on the patio, you need to call the restaurant direct, even though on OpenTable there is a box for, wait for it, special requests! Fortunately since I have no desire to return to this typical chain restaurant, I wont need to call the restaurant direct. P.S. I only gave it two stars because of the speed at which the server saw the two hockey pucks on my plate and corrected it.",

My advice -- stay away, there are lots better places in Scottsdale and environs.  Waiter started out by lauding the size of various salads, entrees, etc.  Touted as very splitable. We split the prawn risotto. A dollop of risotto, covered by 2 prawns each.  That 4th prawn was an extra charge.  Friends split the lasagne.  We all know what a slice of lasagne should look like.  The split portions were served in a cup the size of a small custard cup.  But each had a slice of bread attached to this sumptuous presentation!  The restaurant should have been embarrassed to have brought such a joke to the table.    A third friend sent her seared tuna entree back twice.  It was served ice cold each time. They gave up and just took it off the bill.  The days of free dessert to atone for bad food and service are long gone.  This place is a culinary joke.  Don't waster your time and money.  You'll be disappointed.",

We were seated outside and enjoyed the ambiance and service immediately.   The bread and pesto were phenomenal, as were the Red Sangria, Truffle and Parmesan fries, and Risotto.   I sampled my boyfriend's Ono dish as well and that was delicious, although the general consensus was that it was great although the rub was a bit salty.  A restaurant of this caliber in Los Angeles would have been much more expensive than it ended up being.  The service was attentive without being intrusive, the food was delicious, and the location next to the canal was wonderful.  I will definitely be making another stop here on my next trip out.",

    "text": "I am giving Olive & Ivy only 1 star because the employees have no idea how to run a restaurant or deal with customers.  We went there to celebrate a Birthday which did not go too well.  First when we made the reservation we were told to come in before 3pm on a Sunday so we could order from 3 menus well when we arrived, we were told a different story about the menus and told something else by another person and the story kept changing depending on who you spoke with.  Well this restaurant should be closed between 3-5pm on weekends as the only items are flatbreads, a select few salads and apps but no one tells you this when you call.  So we had planned to order dinner but were told we could not something to do with the kitchen, but we were also told we could not order from the brunch or lunch menu either so we were stuck as to what to order, well it was terrible - the flat breads were terrible, dry and way to salty. The bacon burger was not worth $12.00 and it was just a real bad time and the manager would not comp anything for all the bad information and did not seem to care we could not find anything good to eat on the menu.  We had told the waitress we could not handle anything spicy as to let us know if we ordered something which was spicy well do not order the hummus, we were not told it had jalapenos in it even though we asked, they did not take it off the bill even though 5 of the 6 people at the table did not eat it.  We will not visit again, very bad experience, bad manager, bad customer service.  not a good fox restaurant, plus the uniforms looked like construction workers.  The food, was well not worth the money and have had much better elsewhere.",

Wish there would have been tables available on the patio as it's gorgeous out there.  Nevertheless the interior is also very attractive.  The warm foccacia bread with pesto was awesome and complimentary.   We had an amazing butternut squash and shrimp soup to take the chill out on a cold afternoon.   My husband had the goat cheese and duck confit tortellini (fresh), I had the lasagna bolognese and my son had the salmon.  All were perfectly cooked.   For dessert we shared the cheesecake.  The only thing we found odd was that the lasagna was served in a bowl and the cheesecake in a mason type jar.  Nevertheless the flavors were there!  We will be back to check out the dinner menu for sure.",

Starting with the kids option - I ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server told me will have short noodles for easy pick up by a small toddler, it was made of long wide noddle, even after cutting it was not fit for a child. I ordered the grilled cheese which was okay, really not tasty as it should be.  My friend and I shared the rock shrimp which was awful, tasteless and the shrimp was not cleaned through so we had some crunchy sand like experience. Then we shared the corn flat bread which looked and tasted like airport food.  We decided to leave and got our check - for what we got paying that much was a big disappointment. They didn't even take the kid pasta dish off... $5 people... really?  I will not go back unless it is for drinks only. The two stars rating is for design, location and an okay service. Food deserve ONE.",

When it came, I was a bit shocked to see 3 scallops and the equivalent of one asparagus sliced into 6 long strips on the plate. Not what I was expecting, but still quite good. I didn't need all the food anyway, because I stuffed myself on the focaccia bread earlier.",

However, my gripe is that I don't really think it's worth $10. That is a little steep for that particular drink in my opinion, as they don't make it too strong and it's not muddled to perfection a la Trader Vic's style.  Their food is good to really good, and I do think that most of the menu is over priced. That's probably because you are paying for the \"concept\" not the food. As per usual, Olive & Ivy attracts a fake crowd - just like most of the Sam Fox spots. On the other side though, this restaurant does provide me with some excellent people watching and that's always fun every once in a while.   Some other good aspects of Olive & Ivy are the: outdoor patio (great place to sip my Mojito and people watch), sea bass or seared ahi tuna dishes (I'll usual order one or the other) and the service (their wait staff is on top of their tables).  Olive & Ivy doesn't get me too excited so it's a solid 3 stars... because if someone asked me to suggest a restaurant in the Waterfront area, it probably wouldn't be my first recommendation.",

Although there are some $$$ items, there's also some fantastic reasonable dishes. Here's my idea of a wonderful Olive & Ivy dinner- a drink on the patio along the canal, then sit at a booth inside and enjoy truffle fries with the aioli dip PLUS the house focaccia bread with pesto to start. wow. Then I eat the chopped Mediterranean chicken salad to make myself feel better. The salad is AMAZING. Beautiful place, very romantic. It's probably my fav Fox restaurant. Other items on the menu are great too like the fish and risotto.   I think the service is great, although you can tell the server is bummed I'm not ordering more expensive stuff, but who cares!!?!

The booths are super comfy and I like that, depending on where you're sitting, you can see the chefs cooking up something awesome with flames licking the air like you're in the most awesome depths of hell (not as punishment, more like a 1980's heavy metal fantasy).  While there are items on the menu that are pretty goddamned expensive, there's always something there that's within your price range.    I like how on the other side of the restaurant you can just order something to go deli-style and grab a bottled beverage and run in and out really quick if you've got a tight time-restraint on your lunch break.  However, considering how highly the restaurant obviously thinks of itself (it really does), the food isn't that good.  Now, don't get me wrong, it's not disgusting by any means and it's certainly not even bad.  It's good.  It is definitely good, but... I mean with the lush interiors and all the fake Scottsdale noses you see around, I'd think their food would be... better?  I'm trying not to sound like a picky little bitch, but man, when you get the fries with the burger, the fries just aren't very good, man.  The burger is kind of a standard, kind of hard to fuck up, but, y'know, it could be better.  I had their short rib sandwich and just wasn't into it.  The pasta I got another time was good, I liked it, but it seemed to me like something I would probably make myself super bored staying at home.  It's altogether an alright place.  Their drinks are usually pretty good and the service is awesome.  Three stars.",

    "text": "Once again a win, came here with some friends and sat on the patio. Needless to say, I will most definitely be returning. The food is made to order, fresh, and plated delicately to soak into your hungry tastebuds. The pitcher of Pear Sangria was a must have for summer on the patio. We began with a couple different choices of bruschetta which was a perfect light bite! The Mozzarella bruschetta was my favorite of the 3 we chose, followed by the mushroom one. The sweet potato cannelloni is amazing! If you like sweet creamy bites, leafy sauteed spinach and a nice delicate crunch due to the almond crisps this dish is for you! The lamb meatballs were also a fan at our table if you're looking for a heartier dish. Lastly the salmon and fingerling potatoes were light and refreshingly delicious! The service here is always amazing and the ambiance is what the place is known for! Highly recommend!",

She does not miss a beat and is on top of all the tiny details that take a dining experience to the next level. My fiance and I were able to enjoy a very romantic dinner on the beautiful patio because we were so well taken care of. Loved the kale salad and the natural chicken- which is one of the best chicken dishes at any restaurant. Will be asking for Nicole from on- thanks for a great night!",

We didn't get a patio seat but the doors open all the way up so even sitting inside, so even sitting inside feels like outdoor seating. There are fireplaces outside, and groups sit together around the fireplaces.   Ambience of restaurant was cozy with great warm lighting and a high-end atmosphere.   Red sangria was delicious!  Scallops on creamy polenta was delicious. Perfectly cooked. Sea bass was also delicious, but I felt that the plate was a little too light on other things. Two pieces of cauliflower and a quarter of a grapefruit left me hungry.  We got the peanut butter mousse for dessert, and that was the highlight for us! Tasted like a peanut butter cup--yum!  Prices are certainly not cheap, so I'd recommend coming to happy hour here, unless you're looking to blow some cash. Overall, great eats in Scottsdale.",

Parking is the usual situation in this area, garages and street parking if you can get it. We were seated quickly and chose to sit outside as it was gorgeous. There is a view of the Scottsdale waterfront. We had breakfast and both enjoyed our meals. The peach cocktails we had were great and helped make our Sunday funday on point. My sister and I will definitely be back. We have done dinner here in the past as well and enjoyed that too. The service is great here and we always enjoy our time here. Just now getting around to reviewing them. This is a good one though, put it on your list as a must go!",

    "text": "I feel so sad to be giving this review. Olive and Ivy has always had a special place in my heart but tonight's experience was terrible. We probably come once/twice a year and we came for my birthday. When my husband made the reservation he specified it was my birthday. We got no recognition from our waiter. We ordered our drinks and my step sons soda came out with like no carbonation, the focaccia bread that I usually love was SO salty, it was almost inedible. The pesto was good however. My 2 younger children were with us so he did make sure their cheese pizza (which was delicious) arrived earlier so they could start eating but he didn't hear my stepson say no onions on his flatbread so he ended up picking them out and the waiter offered no empathy. My shrimp risotto that I had planned to share with my toddler was super spicy so I couldn't share it. Also, he gave some lame excuse but our food took forever! We have young kids so you know the importance of getting our food quick, our kids were done with their pizza by the time our food came so they were getting antsy. And then when it came time for my birthday dessert, he didn't remember it was my birthday and just asked if I wanted dessert versus what can i get you for your birthday dessert.   It was just little things tonight and when we don't come often, it's not easy to overlook. I am not sure we will be coming back. There are too many other places to try in the valley.",

But the appetizers & flatbreads WERE -- and they were more than plentiful & damn tasty. Our waitress (Nikki) was very attentive, funny, and free w/ suggestions when asked her opinion about what to order. The outside seating area was well laid out & aside from the man & women who really needed to GET A ROOM! (and oh, pay a babysitter, instead of ignoring their kids), it was a wonderful experience. There's a parking garage just across the street so there's no reason you shouldn't check this place out. Three people: three different drinks, appetizers, desserts. Everything was stupendous. Definitely a place to visit again and again and again.",

A few of my go to dishes have been lamb meatballs, wild mushroom pappardelle and sea bass.   Perhaps the preparations here are somewhat on the classic side, many dishes are simpler in nature and something I can see myself recreating at home. Not a ton of creativity, but proven recipes, which is by no means a bad thing. Wines are priced very fairly here, I usually go for a bottle of Vueve Cliquot.  The vibe is phenomenal. It is fun, not overly loud and the patio photos speak for themselves. It is without doubt one of the best patios in the area. I've returned to the establishment for many reasons and will continue to do so on many occasions to come. Romantic, fun, vibrant and delicious.",

The drink was really well made and I ended up having 2 more which is something Samantha would have been proud of. The hummus plate w fresh veggies hit the spot while we waited for our lunch order. I had the bacon cheeseburger w avocado and a side of fresh. Well cooked burger and helped the start off the day of drinking on the right note. The only down side here was the service was a bit slow and we lost our server a few times. They were pretty busy so I'm sure it was just a one off situation. But we will definitely be and next time I'll bring the whole Gang from Sex n the City. Cheers!",

There are plenty of free street spaces, as well as a free parking garage nearby.   The hostess seated us immediately. They have a nice brunch menu with fun options! I ordered a Veggie Scramble and my cousin ordered an Eggs Benedict. Our food came out very quickly. It was delicious! The potatoes were perfect. My eggs were saltier than I was expecting, but I would order it again nonetheless!   I'd give this restaurant a solid 4 stars. My only complaint was that our waitress was somewhat standoffish. I didn't feel that we were receiving the best service from her. She made minimal eye contact and was rather abrupt. It almost felt like she was giving us an attitude. But, the rest of the waitstaff were great, and were so kind in their service!  Overall, a pleasant experience! I think they have a great setup, and the food is fantastic. By Scottsdale's standards, it's affordable and worth it!",

It offers outdoor seating under developed green trees or indoor with floor to ceiling glass, and a beautifully lit ambiance. The service is phenomenal, and you can tell the staff works as a team.

The chefs counter is also a really cool experience if you can snag a seat. The drinks are inventive and delicious. Dan and Jimmy are great managers, and have always made our table and guests feel especially welcome. One of my favorite servers is Angelo, he is always very attentive. Thanks for the awesome experiences!",

    "text": "This was probably my favorite spot of all the places I visited on my Scottsdale vacation. Everything from ambiance, to service, wine and food was superb. We liked it so much we came twice. The first night was a Friday night. The restaurant had so much life, attracting visitors and locals looking for a nice place to socials, dine and drink good wine. I loved the outdoor lounge area overlooking the water. Situated in the heart of old town, with the happening older nightlife.   Our intention was to just grab an appetizer and wine and head to another location for dinner but we loved the vibe so much we stayed. They had a dj inside that played a great mix of music, to keep the place lively and fun. The second night was a Monday, Halloween evening. Much more mellow, still just as enjoyable. This time around we got a bottle of red for $30 that was delicious and got a nice little buzz!  Food?! Everything looks good. Whether you're going for wine and shareables, cheese platter, main dish or dessert. We loved the mozzarella bruschetta, mushroom pasta dish and two scoops of gelato for dinner. Chop salad is also good, but had what seemed like granola on top... kinda weird! Will definitely be back on my next visit to Scottsdale.",

Great place to bring people visiting from out of town so you can walk around old town before or after your meal. The bridge is a great place to take pics. The restaurant patio is super cute, overlooks the little river and reminds me a little of Europe.   Food is fresh and service is great. They provide you with complimentary bread and fresh pesto. I had to refrain myself from licking the plate! I split a burger and kale salad with a friend and they actually split it for us which was super thoughtful of them. Burger was fantastic. Kale salad was huge, even when it was split. I've been for both brunch and dinner now and both menus are great. Sometimes they have a live dj in the evening which creates a fun ambiance.   Love that they've managed to create a classy place without it feeling too upscale or stuffy. Prices are affordable too. Can't wait to return and try their desserts!",

As for food, we received complimentary bread and pesto. We ordered the fritto appetizer (deep fried calamari, zucchini, and shrimp), ahi tuna, and the mushroom truffle pappardelle). The tuna was seared and had a nice miso/teriyaki flavor. I think the pasta dish could have used a bit more cheesy flavor. For dessert we received a birthday dessert on the house-- strawberry shortcake with sorbet.  Our waiter was very attentive and hospitable.   I would definitely dine here again!",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night and we were a little late for our reservation because of traffic. Walking in the place is dark, modern, and really loud. We got seated outside on the patio right next to the Riverwalk. Only problem is you can't see the Riverwalk because of the bushes.   The patio has lots of trees for shade covering and water misters. It was a pretty hot night and the misters help cool it down some.   Our server greeted us fairly quickly. Got our drink orders and water cups pretty quickly especially since it was pretty warm outside.   We started out with the Bruschetta comb. We had the Strawberry & Apple, Prosciutto & Fig, and Manchego.  They give you one of each but cut it up into three pieces so everyone can enjoy a variety. They were all good but probably my favorite was the strawberry & apple. They were all very fresh and tasty.   I had the Bouillabaisse. Huge bowl of basically seafood soup. Not a lot of soup but just overflowing with seafood. Muscles, clams, scallops, shrimp, and fish. Everything was cooked perfectly. Excellent dish. Really enjoyed it.   My wife had the chicken Scallopini. Very tender chicken with spinach. I had a bite and and it was delicious. Very good and my wife really enjoyed it. My daughter had the pacific sea bass and her words were that is was cooked perfectly. Very tender and really good. She loved it. Son got the bone-in ribeye and they put some cream sauce on it and he thought it was one of the best ribeye he's had. That's saying a lot there.   We ended our meal with lemon pudding cake and the strawberry Mille-Feuille. They were both really good. Lemon cake was so good. Not dry at all. Very moist with a scoop of ice cream. Really really good. The strawberry Mille-Feuille had three wafer waffles with a scoop of ice cream on top. It was good but the lemon pudding cake was the best in my opinion.   So overall we had a really good meal. Very good service. Really good food. It was pretty loud outside but really warm. It reminded me outside of a garden with lots of tree. Too bad there was no view of the Riverwalk. The outside wasn't as loud and inside. It seemed like people were trying to talk over everyone else so really loud inside. I think I would prefer to come during the cooler time of the year but everything else was really good. Enjoy",

We have had many dishes here including the pastrami sandwich, various pastas, and raviolis. All of which are great. The setting is very well constructed, and allows for a nice ambiance.

BUT still three stars because it's actually awesome. If we didn't get sick, easily a 4 or 5. Could have just been a weird coincidence!   First of all the place is ADORABLE. The inside is great, but the outside patio is amazingly beautiful. It's right on the water and there are cute string lights and fountains. It looks like a European garden. There are misters so don't worry about being too hot during the summer.   You HAVE to try the bruschetta board. It's fantastic. The bread is so fresh and the toppings were perfect. For my meal I ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes. It was flavored really well... the only thing I wish was that the skin was crispy. And for my favorite part: dessert. We had the strawberry shortcake. Amazing.   SO if you have a strong stomach, try it. If you don't, try it and bring Tums just in case. It's worth it.",

I have been wanting to try out this place based on the menu alone, but I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped in. There's a market side and then a restaurant side. The restaurant size itself is large and there's a great big patio too! The ambiance, although a little on the dimmer side, remained cute and cozy.   Our waitress was super nice and attentive. She offered some great suggestions. We ended up getting the cilantro jalapeno hummus to start (comes with cucumbers, celery, AND carrot sticks) to snack on while we drank our white sangria that we ordered by the pitcher. We ended it with a lemon pudding cake (complimentary). It's good if you like lemon! The top was fluffy and the bottom was a little soggier...but not in a bad way? Soggy is the wrong word probably but I can't think of another way to describe it!! Haha. It comes with a burnt honey ice cream and blackberries. Yum! :)  It was a great spot.",

We both looked at the menu online and decided they had what we wanted.  When we for there, we were given a totally different menu which had nothing that we had picked.  I'm guessing it was their new lunch menu.  It didn't even include their bruschetta which we love getting every time we go.  We were told we could sit at the bar for over a half an hour for their limited dinner menu to kick in, but that is unacceptable.  We ended up leaving and will probably never return since they did seem to care why we decided to leave.  A company without concern for their patrons is a company that won't get our money.  I hope in the future they decide to go back to a menu that actually has some substance, but I would bet money on them staying the course, even though it has alienated at least us as customers.",

    "text": "In a great location, came here for dinner while visiting Scottsdale for a girls' trip. Without a reservation, we were still seated within 30 minutes which isn't bad for a Friday night or for 5 guests. The inside ambiance is fantastic. Lanterns hung so it looks like they are floating, great mood lighting, open kitchen... Mediterranean feel to the decor and drinks. Great start for our Friday night out.  Mediterranean food always sounds great to my friends and I but O&I's menu seemed more Italian influenced. As others mentioned, the bread and pesto is delicious. The portion sizes are large for my friends and I opted to split entrees. To be honest, I don't even remember the vegetarian option I ate (something wit mushrooms) because all I can remember is how amazing the pumpkin cannelloni is (which our other friends got).  Definitely reservations if you can. With a centralized location, it's easily a great place to start your night off in Scottsdale.",

The ambiance is great and has an expansive Mediterranean feel, yet at the same time our booth felt cozy. It also gave us a bit of a waterfront view (the patio, cooled by mist, would've been very tempting if not for my post-hike state).   Cinnamon is my mortal enemy but I really wanted to try their French toast anyhow. They happily accommodated my request for a non-cinnamon version and recommended I do the compote on the side too. Our server also recommended the homestyle cheddar biscuit, topped with sausage gravy. I am glad he did because it was amazing.",

However, as I was about to leave, I gave my waitress my debit card to pay for my $13 salad, and while she was processing my payment, I received an email from my bank saying that a $274 charge was put on my account from Olive & Ivy. Of course I was very concerned. The waitress came back and handed me my card saying that she accidentally slid my card for another table's order. She apologized and said she fixed it, but acted like it wasn't a big deal at all. She didn't even bother to void my $13 dollar salad, but slid my card AGAIN to charge me for that. So I had paid almost $300 for a salad. The waitress's ignorance/lack of paying attention was a huge inconvenience. I had to call my bank a couple days later to put in a claim to dispute the charges, and had to wait a couple more days to get that money back in my account.   That being said, this place could definitely use some better service. The only reason I'd ever come back here is for the food alone.",

Lunch however the servers have been great and the multi colored beet salad with goat cheese is hands down my favorite. Get it every time. He sweet potato cannolini is to die for.

We started with a lot of appetizers The appetizers were SO good. The various bruschettas we got, as well as the salads were great. but that duck confit flatbread - OMG TO DIE FOR.    All of the entrees were also excellent although after all of the appetizers, we opted to share entrees given the size of each of the dishes! The salmon was cooked to perfection and SO fresh. The sea bass - definitely great.    My onnnlllyyyyy complaint is the scallops. They were cooked TO PERFECTION, but they had an overbearing sweet sauce that completely ruined the dish.

For an appetizer, we ordered the vine ripe tomato bruschetta. It's really only good for 1 serving, so I suggest if you're sharing order 3 for $11.  We also ordered the fritto misto which is a mix of fried zucchini, rock shrimp and calamari.  I felt it was a little salty for my taste but still a good appetizer.   My friend was craving beets, so she ordered the beet salad. For some reason, I thought beets were dark reddish colored but these beets were yellow/orangeish.   My main dish was the chicken scallopini which consisted for 2 large chicken breasts with prosciutto and mozzarella in the middle. You can definitely share this dish because it was big.  My friend ordered the sweet potato cannelloni which basically to me was like a stuffed ravioli. I love sweet potatoes so this dish was really yummy. I will order this one next time.   The restaurant has a bar (the white sangria was yummy) and the space is very open/large.  Price wise: Entrees range from $15 to $30 depending on what you order. I think fish options and seafood dishes were pretty expensive for me personally.   Overall, great dining experience.",

We are a young couple and like music, but it was so loud we couldn't converse.  Totally inappropriate for the atmosphere. We told the waiter we were leaving.  Instead, he said he could get us a quiet table.  He found us a spot in the marketplace, which although it felt like a closet, it was at least a calm closet.  We had glasses of wine (reasonably priced), I had a kale salad which was amazing (first time ive liked kale to be honest), and my gf had some kind of fish dish.  Good food!  Like it.  Ditch the band.",

    "text": "One of, if not the best, restaurant experiences we've ever had. My husband and I came to Scottsdale for our babymoon, we're expecting our first child. We walked into Olive & Ivy, no reservations, and were told that the wait inside was 2 hours but they could sit us in the patio. We took their offer and glad we did. Our server, Miranda, was attentive from the moment we sat down. She got our drinks right away. I asked if their feta was pasteurized & explained how there are certain cheeses I can't have since I'm pregnant. So we ordered the hummus for an app but no feta to be safe since she wasn't sure. Miranda still followed up with the kitchen to ask about their cheeses being pasteurized or not (which most are), and then we ordered the \"Natural Chicken\" and their ravioli. Radom servers would walk by to refill our waters when needed, food came out quick. My husband went and ordered a mojito, my favorite drink and I joked about how he's torturing me, but she offered a virgin mojito and took her up on it! My husband said it was the best mojito he's ever had and the virgin drink tasted almost identical.  Toward the end of our meal, Miranda brought dessert menus and said, \"Dessert is on me, pick what you'd like!\" We were floored. We ordered the caramelized cake (AMAZING). At first we didn't understand why, and when the dessert came out, it said \"Congratulations!\" with a pink and blue candle. We so impressed with the food and service we asked for the manager, Jimmy. He was hospitable, respected by his employees by the way they interacted with him, and even had me try two of his favorite gelatos.  Suffice to say our dinner experience was incredible. Both my husband and I were servers for a number of years, so for us to have great service from the hosts, bussers, and other servers, was pretty great.",

One of the Phoenix Suns coach was there that night and took care of us.  Anyway I've been here several times since then, and always have a great time. I love the open high ceilings w/ dark wood flooring and swanky decor. Of all the times we would come here, it had always been on a busy wkend night... So the ambiance is perfect... packed w/ good-looking people mingling at the inviting open bar.  My most recent visit was yesterday...which was my first experience having lunch here. There was a live band and the floor-to-ceiling windows were wide open to the patio... wow it looked great. We decided to not wait for the table since we found seats at the bar. I have to rave about the salad.... Mediterranean w/ chicken.... OMG one of the best I've ever tasted... absolutely delicious! And the crisp White Haven was paired perfectly w/ it ( and I'm not a big fan of white wine... but it was a warm sunny day). The service was a bit slow but the bartender admitted they were short- staffed... And it was super busy. So I didn't mind as long as our wine glasses were topped off... :) which he promptly always did w/ a smile.",

I eat lunch out 5 days a week always at nice places mostly on business. This place does not stand up against others in the neighborhood and price range. Parking is always a hassle the valet is a mess and takes too long because the garage is a way off by Urban Outfitters. The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses. After putting my folder on the floor, no space on the table, I ordered. Veal and spinach ravioli, four very small excellent ravioli for $15, one of which was gristle and which I had to spit out. The portion was a ridiculous excuse for an entree portion. I'm done with this place and don't see going back. It's just not worth the price or hassle, especially given the 100 other choices within a three block radius.",

(very nice touch) It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, rainy and gray, so perhaps this added a star to my review.

    "text": "We met some friends who just moved to the Valley at Olive and Ivy last Tuesday night for some drinks and food. For a Tuesday night it was really crowded, but I attribute that to the Insight Bowl being the next day which prompted an event nearby that brought many people to the SFS area. We were the last in our group to arrive and we were at a small table near the bar area - definitely if you have more than three to four people, get a larger table! It was still cozy and chic...loved the ambiance and feel of Olive and Ivy. One negative is that it does get very loud, so hearing the person across the table from you can be a challenge at some points.  Our server was very nice and helped us make some drink selections. The sauvignon blanc she recommended I get was excellent. I had the pesto flatbread which was delicious...it was the perfect size I thought. Chris had the proscutto and fig flatbread and he liked it, although he said he could have preferred a little more goat cheese and a little less fig. I also had a caesar salad, which was average - nothing to rave over. Our other dining companions enjoyed their flatbreads as well. Our group's only complaint was that the timing of the service of the food was off...our friends had ordered the calamari appetizer and I asked for my salad to be brought out first and our flatbreads arrived first! A minute later, the calamari and salad were brought out...it was entirely too much food for our little table, but due to our ingenuity we made it work. Our group of five's bill came to about $160 which included four flatbreads, a salad, calamari and a handful of drinks.  They do offer valet, but with the parking garage at Nordstrom's so close as well as the Waterfront parking garage, I am not sure what the point is of the valet. Olive and Ivy is definitely a place I see myself returning to meet some girlfriends for drinks or a place to eat lunch while out shopping at SFS.",

    "text": "Update: OK. So, I still haven't returned to Olive & Ivy except to fetch a bottle of water for my wife during a nice stroll around the canal. But I run by the place almost every morning and started to think I was being unfair - and, perhaps, a little juvenile, in my review. Forget about the Grilled Cheese Incident. But the rest of it - snooty wait staff attitude, included - should be given the weight you deem appropriate. Cheers.   ===============================  It's two pieces of bread and some cheese ... maybe some butter. It's a grilled cheese, of course, and, it turns out, you can't get one at this place. That may not be surprising given the upscale nature of Olive & Ivy. But it's on the menu. The menu it's on just happens to be in the adjoining marketplace. But what does that matter when we're talking about a lousy grilled cheese sandwich. If that were only it, though.   Not long ago, I joined my wife and a friend for a few drinks and what likely would have transitioned into dinner. We sat in the bar area after being initially and erroneously told that food was unavailable on their fabulous patio. Our bar server told us otherwise and we were soon relaxing next to a roaring blaze outside. Problem One: Solved. Unfortunately, it was replaced by Problem Two: Our server.  As it turns out, the young lady apparently didn't think highly of us sitting on the patio. After all, she had to schlep 20 or 25 extra yards to help us. We tried to make it up to her with a little self-deprecating humor, offering that she \"probably hated us for sitting\" outside but we were good tippers. She grimaced and forced out a laugh. Whatever. What do you want for $15 glasses of wine and $8 beers? Speaking of beer ... Problem Three: Beer selection.   Olive & Ivy has, apparently, thousands of bottles of wine. I mean, the bottles reach the ceiling and keep going. Very impressive ... if you drink wine. I, as you may know, do not. I drink beer. And I'm not embarrassed to say so. In fact, I pretty much drink one beer --- Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. That they did not have. Well, they had it in the marketplace but not on the beverage list. (Yes, I did consider buying the six pack of Sierra in the marketplace and bringing it outside to the patio. It was only $2.50 a beer. But like I said, this was a pretty upscale place.)  There were the usual suspects: Coors or Corona or whatever. But then there were some other, European offerings, one which I chose and enjoyed. Nevertheless, it continues to amaze me that restaurateurs spend tens of thousands --- maybe even hundreds of thousands --- of dollars on wine inventory and the like, but can't manage to get the distributor to throw in an extra couple of cases of acceptable beer. A shame, to be sure. Anyway, Problem Three: Solved, more or less. But this is where it all devolves. So, back to Problem Two: Our server.  We enjoyed drinks and a terrific flatbread appetizer before finally succumbing to the server's constant barrage of dinner offerings. The girls placed their orders without challenge. Me? I wanted a grilled cheese. So, I asked for one. It seemed simple enough. The server shot back that a grilled cheese likely would not be made, but she would check. In her absence and all things about the night considered, we decided that if these folks who can put together a grilled flat iron steak with caramelized shallots couldn't manage to slap together two pieces of bread and some cheese we didn't want any of it.   Our server came back a few minutes later and happily informed us that a grilled cheese was not available. As agreed, we asked for the check. \"I am so glad I didn't put that order in,\" she declared with glee. An appropriate tip ensued and we were on our way out. Before leaving, though, we stopped to ask about the availability of the grilled cheese in the marketplace. It was not available, a manger-type-looking person said, because the materials had been put away for the day. I'm wondering, of course, why at the end of the afternoon the folks at Olive & Ivy need to file away bread and cheese in some far-flung locker that is apparently on a sort of time lock until the next day's lunch. I also was curious as to why a restaurant --- fancy or otherwise --- would throw away what would have been an extra $100 in sales because of a grilled cheese. Say what you will about our tactics. But in the end, all of our problems came to an end when we walked out the half-broken front door.",

It was a fun place to meet up with friends for cocktails with a live dj!  The calamari was the best I have had in awhile.  Service was a bit slow in the lounge.  Great patio with a firepit, fountain and plenty of seating with misters.",

    "text": "All Style, No Substance...  For all the hype about Olive & Ivy, the food doesn't measure up.  Not sure where the 5 star reviews come from.... not the food for me, nor the service which alternated between crabbiness and nervous hovering. Our patio server didn't want to transfer our check despite the fact we never even received our drinks on the patio before being seated in the restaurant. Our dining room server lingered by our table incessantly, seeming to not know when to approach or interrupt us.   The food was... eh. Although the scallops were cooked perfectly, they had zero flavor.  The spinach was bland and pointless: not cooked, not raw, with some flavorless broth just splashed over. Could that possibly be the sherry syrup? The dish boasted wild mushrooms (two) and crisp pancetta. Is that what those three tiny chunks were? The lemon aceto on the halibut was excruciating. The tuna tartare was absolutely flavorless. Where was the Red Chile Aioli? The pesto flatbread was perhaps the most edible thing of the evening. The affogatto dessert was described as Vanilla Gelato, Stream Lined Espresso and Kahlua Cream. I didn't mind the puddle of espresso with vanilla ice cream melting in the middle but the unsweetened cream on top...? ick. Where was the Kahlua?  Sangria was tasty, but despite paying for a $6.00 large Pellegrino, it disappeared from my table and I only received half a refill. I only drank 1/4 of the bottle, wherever it was.   Cougar alert!!!  Olive & Ivy remains open for its feverish cougar bar scene and patio. It's a shame that the food doesn't merit the incredible building it is served in.",

    "text": "The BFF and I decided to have a fancy date night and get dressed up to go to dinner and a movie.  We decided on Olive & Ivy because it was centrally located for us and had a nice ambience.  I made reservations for us because it made it feel more \"date-like\" and also I was going to be coming straight from work and knew I'd be starving.  I got there just about exactly when my reservation was made for and was told to have a seat and my table would be ready shortly.  Now, the place wasn't packed by any means, sure there was a good number of people in the restaurant but there wasn't like a huge group of people waiting around to be seated.  For some reason though, despite the fact that I'd made a reservation, I waited for 15-20 minutes for my table.  So what's the point of making a reservation?  I could have walked in off the street and had the same thing.  Once we got to our table the server came over right away and introduced himself and offered us drinks.  Since my friend is pregnant she was asking about non-alcoholic options but they really didn't have many selections so she stuck with water as did I so as not to feel like I was teasing her by dangling a martini in her face.  We decided to get the 3 bruschetta for $11 deal as an appetizer to tide us over to our main course.  They were all delicious but pretty small, only 3 pieces per slice.  We both decided on the Mediterranean Salad, with hers she asked for it with no feta and a side of olives though.  They were good but not outstanding.  Our server was friendly the whole time and did an awesome job making sure our water was full and we had whatever we needed.  I ended my meal with the passion fruit sorbet which was good at first but the flavor got to be a bit too much after a few bites.",

The room has a minimum and we were going to be short, so instead of just paying the difference, Lauren recommended a champagne toast for our guest of honor which allowed us to use our funds and made the night extra special! It was a dinner we won't soon forget. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a special night out and we will be back next time we are in town!",

We had fantastic service, I loved the proprietary wine selection (the pinot noir was especially good), and the food was delicious.  My only complaint is that the portions were just way too small for the prices being charged. Salads were nice and big, but the $25 fish entree was maybe 4 oz of fish, and the scallops only came with 3 smallish scallops on the plate. Definitely not enough of a meal for any of our men! We wound up needing to stop for fast food after the pep rally because they were all starving again an hour and a half later.",

Can a salad merit 5-stars? Yes. Yes, because I do not enjoy salads 99/100 times. Unfortunately, I don't see it on their menu and I've only been back once since I first ordered it here. If I return, it's the chopped chicken salad (+corn) for me!  They also have delicious mac'n'cheese, pizza, and WINE! Who doesn't enjoy a personal-sized carafe of wine during lunch? There's nothing like jumping into the office with a few of your worries thrown down the hatch like a chilled white in the early afternoon!",

Our issue last night was with our server. She started out okay, a little slow to come check on us or to get our order. Never refilled our drinks or waters. We ordered appetizers and they were long gone by the time she ever came around to take our dinner order.   Once dinner was delivered we NEVER saw her again. We never had our waters refilled once, were never checked on to see if the food came out okay, nothing. We waited an hour before I had to flag down another server just so we could get our bill. The other server was quick to see we had been sitting there with dirty plates and empty glasses and were clearly irritated and she helped us quickly. It was pretty clear that our waitress had left for the night without telling us or any of the other staff to check in at our table.   What was planned to be a quick meal ended up lasting over 3 hours due to the extremely long time we spent waiting. I was just surprised that a restaurant of this caliber would have such poor service. It's unlikely we'll return.",

The ambience was relaxing and open. the patio area is gorgeous and directly on the canal.   The service was wonderful and patient with such a large group.   If you like bruschetta then you should try a mix and match of their selections. Side note, the mushroom one tasted a little funky.  Overall we loved the experience.",

I believe that Olive and Ivy was one of the first restaurants he opened outside of Tucson and at the time it was no sure thing that he would make it. That's why I am happy that it is so good and that he has done so well.  The food is delicious and I can't even begin to pick my favorite because everything is so good.   What I really love though is the atmosphere. Whether you sit inside or out, it's great... but I always try and sit on the patio. There's nothing like enjoying a beautiful Scottsdale day overlooking the Arizona Canal.  With new restaurants constantly opening and closing, I'm glad that Olive and Ivy has stood for so long and I hope it's around for many more years.",

We had heard the food in Phoenix could be hit-or-miss but Olive & Ivy was surprisingly great.   We started with the artichoke appetizer with sous vid artichoke hearts, arugula, and parmesan - woah, so so good. Hubby and I split the Shrimp Scampi Risotto that was super lemony and fresh as well as the Chicken Scallopini which was like the best chicken parmesan with savory sauce EVER. We topped the meal with the Chocolate Bar; a chocolate mousse with cherry chip ice cream that was incredible.   Several people in the know recommended Olive & Ivy and they didn't steer us wrong. Would highly recommend to out of towners looking for a nice dinner in Scottsdale. $120 for drinking two before tax and tip. Service was exceptional.",

I will say this, I brunch often in Miami so I'm pretty sure the review may be bias but I'll let you be the judge of that.  Ok so service is ok, nothing extra. I sat at the bar and all the bartenders talked to each other about each other and only addressed the people when they needed something and went back to their own world. They were direct, that's the word. Direct, no friendly smile or hey I recommend this.  The food was just ok, nothing that made it different. Brunch consists of eggs, bacon, bread, blah blah nothing that made it unique. I was expecting something different, maybe in taste or maybe in presentation. But nope it was plain Jane breakfast. I may go back to try the bakery sweets but if you are looking for a brunch spot it's not this one. But a quick breakfast and maybe a sit down Quick drink go for it. I gave it 3 stars bc service was ok and the place is in a cute spot. That's it!",

We also got the Bacon wrapped tenderloin, which was nothing short of perfect! Juicy and tender and wonderful flavor!  The desserts were just as good as the entrees. The Caramelized cake is dangerous! Stuffed, and yet we could not put down our spoons and let any of this go without being eaten!  To top it off the ambiance is open and welcoming. There is plenty of outdoor seating if you want to enjoy the Arizona weather. And better yet, Mason, our waiter, was very attentive and helpful! We were very impressed by him.

My girlfriend ordered a glass of wine, my boyfriend ordered a vodka/tonic and our friend ordered another pretty easy drink. I ordered the white sangria and the first sip was off-putting a bit. It tasted like sweet and sour mix was added. I had a few other sips as well as my girlfriend and boyfriend and they both agreed it wasn't right. We asked the bartender to just make me a vodka/water. Much better.   We were seated right at the 30 minute mark. Since we were not too hungry for all of us to get entrees we decided on some small plates to share. We decided on the Lamb Meatballs, Bacon wrapped Dates (two orders of those), an order of 3 different bruschetta, (Prosciutto & Fog, Fresh Mozzarella & Manchego), and our friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad. Everything was great! The service was also great! Friendly waiter and came at the correct times during our meal. We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I wish that I could give 1/2 stars. I would rate 3 1/2 vs 3. Really better than ok but I'm not sure that it rates 4 stars. It was a good restaurant but had some pretty big negatives.   The first thing that I notice was how large the restaurant was. It seemed to go on forever. Which was amazing considering how quickly our food came out. They have an open kitchen so you can see how many people they have working in the kitchen. Needless to say it's busy.   One drawback as others have mentioned is the noise level. Fortunately my husband and I were sitting by drapery panels so the 2 of us could carry on a conversation. Others sitting more towards the inside of the restaurant would have a difficult time hearing each other. Another issue is that it is pretty dark. I understand ambiance but this was a little too much. They know this so they do compensate and make the print larger on the menu. When it came to eating and my food was the same color (fish and cauliflower) it was hard to tell exactly what I was putting on the fork.  Our server was very good. Attentive and full of information when clarification was needed for the menu. We had Avocado bruschetta which was just okay. I should of skipped it. I ordered the Pacific Sea Bass. The fish was good and so was the cauliflower. They only thing I didn't care for was the preserved grapefruit. The funny thing is that while eating it I said to my husband that I didn't like the orange flavor that I was sometimes getting on the fish. It was either orange or when they preserve it then it totally changes the taste profile from grapefruit to orange. My husband had the lasagna bolognese. He was happy with his choice.  Overall, a good restaurant. I took off since it was extremely dark and loud. Also, the food comes out almost too quick if you just want to sit and talk. The food was good, especially for the price, not excellent.",

However, I sat at the bar, and I was the only one there. It seemed that the bartender was more interested in prepping the bar for higher volume than even seeing if i needed more bread or having any conversation at all. I felt more like a nuisance than a paying customer. He served me some very old wine which he promptly changed out when I complained. As for the food, I ordered three pieces of bruschetta bread and one glass of wine. Those two items came up to be over $30. I could imagine paying as much if I were getting top-notch service with exceptional food, but the food was hastily put together and while somewhat flavorful, I would have paid $5 instead of $30!  I am CERTAIN that this place is severely overpriced.",

I'm not usually a big bread eater at dinner, but it was hard not to have a whole loaf just to eat the pesto. I also got the prosciutto bruschetta with a drizzle of honey which was heavenly. My husband isn't the most eclectic of eaters and he was head over heals for it. The salmon entree was perfectly cooked, but I will say that some of the other entrees at the table were a little small. My suggestion to avoid leaving still hungry is to make sure that you get an appetizer or two first if you are getting any of the meat entrees. We all had gelato to finish, I chose the honey flavor. Even though I was stuffed by this point I was glad I made room because it was the perfect finish to dinner.",

The bartenders were responsive but to say they were stiff would be an understatement. The food was good but pricey and I asked them to skip the couscous on my salad and did not remove it. To be fair I think this place is a hipsters dream with the vested pretentious bartenders and the Bellinis and other fancy drinks. If that is your scene you will love this place but it is just not our speed.",

    "text": "Conveniently located near the Scottsdale Fashon, this place is great for a nice lunch before you shop 'til you drop. The restaurant doubles as a marketplace, so you can buy some goods while you're there too.  The decor is clean and fresh and simply done.    Now on to the food.  The one thing to describe their food (at least the two dishes I tried there) is lots and lots of oil.  Maybe that's why it tasted so good.  The Funghi Trifolati flatbread was recommended.  The mushroom and arugula is a wonderful pairing for the simple dish.  The tallegio cheese stretches beautiful when I took a bite.  The only thing I wished was that the thin bread was more crispy.  It was too soft for my taste.  And of course they drenched it with olive oil.    The mushroom tortelli ordered was a light classic dish that was cooked wonderfully as well.  I preferred this dish over the flatbread.  The ravioli was cooked a bit adante which was great, and the flavors blended well with the mushroom.  What I remembered of the sauce was that it was light and drenched in oil again.  See the trend? :-)  But   Overall, I would give a thumbs up for Olive & Ivy.  Happy eating in 2013!",

I've been wanting to try Olive and Ivy for a long time, so when I got notification that they were offering 25% off on Memorial day, I pretty much had to go. I (luckily) made a reservation (otherwise there was a 45 min wait at lunch time). We were seated right away. We had fantastic service throughout with a knowledgeable and friendly waitress. We had the delicious pesto and bread ( 2 servings because I'm a pig) and we split the bacon cheeseburger and the lasagna. The cheeseburger was tasty, with a definite charred taste to it. The onions were really good (and the pesto that came with the bread was good on it too). The lasagna was also tasty, with a distinctly red wine based Bolognese sauce. The portion was large allowing us to take half home. Also, it came with some of the most fantastic garlic bread.... just oozing with butter and garlic... I'd come here just for that. I'll be back!",

Bacon wrapped dates were amazing...so good. The bread/pesto dip is as good as everyone else on Yelp says. I had the sea bass which was delish, and my husband's scallops were great too - his corn mixture under the scallops was the best part I think! To finish we had the ice cream bar dessert...how can you go wrong with caramel ice cream, marshmallow, peanut butter and magic shell topping??? So tasty. The atmosphere was great, very classy and hip but casual at the same time. Our server was great, fabulous sense of humor and made us feel very welcome there. Overall a great experience!",

The potato and prosciutto flatbread is also a must have.",

We started by sharing a duo of greens.. the warm artichoke salad and the chilled beet salad. Yum! Josh made great recommendations and they were spot on. All in all...Josh made the evening amazing. We also appreciated Matt, the manager, informing us about all their restaurants in the area that are chef driven. We cannot wait to try them all!",

    "text": "Two words, the ones to influence you when making your decision: Thoroughly. Delicious.   Moving on to the specifics, highlights include:  Mushroom asparagus flat bread: Seriously beyond the beyond. Shaved bits of parmesan, melted mozzarella, asparagus tips, mushroom pieces and *deep breath* drizzled with blessed truffle oil.   Market salad: fresher than fresh bitter greens, candied citrus peels, balsamic vinaigrette. The market salad is not an every day option, but really damn good so if this is offered on the day you go, get it as a side to make you feel less guilty about eating all the bready wonders in this place (more to come!)  Sangria: True grown up grape juice. Maybe *too* much homage to Welch's.    Hummus: Good. Possibly great. But the aforementioned flat bread eclipsed the shit out of it. I broke my usual rule to only order hummus in straight-up Middle Eastern restaurants. If the hummus is the only veg option in a place, fine, but there are plenty at Olive & Ivy (read: get the damn flat bread!)  And then there's the bread that comes out before everything else. Almost focaccia, but of a less heavy texture, these slices of heavenly gluten come with a pesto dipping sauce.  Note: do not come here if you're god forbid trying to avoid carbs. Not that this is me.  Environs: oozes atmosphere, whether you dine out on the patio or the high ceiling dining room (check out the opulent private dining room which is enclosed in glass, just waiting for wannabe Prince Williams and Kate Middletons. Or even wannabe Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweeds).   Special shout-out to our \"darling\" (as Jeffrey H puts it) waitress.",

Great place for lunch to grab some of the to-go food and sit outside on the sidewalk tables.  Price is not too bad.  If you time it right, you can get some of the fancy bakery items from breakfast marked down to sell.  For dinner this place has great ambiance.

From a food standpoint, during 2 of my visits I ordered some fried eggs over medium with the yolk runny - both times the eggs were cooked over hard.  The other time I ordered an omelet and the eggs were overcooked and the potatoes were over salted.   Service was also mediocre as on 2 occasions as I wasn't greeted at the register and the employees seemed to be in a bad mood - was a little awkward.  Hopefully there are positive changes that happen soon as this restaurant has a great landscape - probably won't return any time soon as there are several other places that consistently deliver on both food and service for around the same price point.",
