I went here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were able to share a pork soondubu and galbi combo, which was about $20. My boyfriend has a shellfish allergy, and the waitstaff was very helpful in ensuring that he was accommodated for. Their ban chan (sides) were really good and they made sure to offer us refills. Their soondubu was also really good, and their galbi was good but a little overcooked. I will definitely be returning here!",

    "text": "TLDR: Good, large portions of food for a low price. There is also a lot of variety so go for groups.  A Korean/Japanese fusion restaurant way off on the side of the Lee Lee's plaza. It's kind of hard to find if you haven't been there because their signage isn't very good, but just keep walking towards the end of the strip until you find it.  Went there once with a group for family style and once just with a friend. I think I liked the family style option more because I got to try more dishes. I usually only want one or two things on any menu at most so making ordering decisions aren't too hard for me, but this place has a lot of options. I liked my dish the second time I went, but I was curious about what the other dishes entrees tasted like.  The portions were huge both times. My friend ordered a bulgogi and it came out in the usual portions but she couldn't even finish half of it. I've seen her eat before and I know she doesn't have trouble finishing her plate, but this time, she started struggling before she could even make a dent in the meat.  Definitely want to go back to this place next time I'm in the area. A little bit sad that I didn't find this place until after I left AZ but nice to have another restaurant to look forward to.",

Both were amazing and its awesome how you can go next door and get snow afterward oye even to lee lees and get your own ingredients to make it at home.  I always love going down here to eat and would highly recommend for authentic quality food.",

    "text": "I had a craving for kalbi tang and found Gogi. Excited, I drove over, delighted to see that it was a new restaurant. I came in around 3PM so it wasn't particularly busy. The restaurant design was tasteful and clean, just the way I like it.   Since there weren't many customers at the time, I was waited on by two people. I had a variety of ban chan and my kalbi tang. Sometimes the service would overlap which could be a good and bad thing. I personally like eating without feeling that someone is watching my every move while devouring into my meal.   So I've had kalbi tang in NY and LA and typically the beef would be stewed to the point that it would fall off the bone. Or there would be bones, but they would be chopped into pieces so it would be easy to eat. In this case, it was two large meat bones. I was terrified to try to eat this without looking like a cave person. Worse, I had come from a work meeting and was wearing a really nice dress today. I tried using my chopsticks to pick the meat off without much success. I had no choice. I picked up the bone and ate the meat off with my hands, it was very messy and stew splashed on me. So embarrassing. Of course I knew they were watching my every move and within minutes a server came by and placed some scissors on my table. I proceeded to spend the next 10 minutes hacking up my beef with my hands and the scissors. Again, very and messy.  I didn't take a picture, but noticed that there is one of the kalbi tang in the photos in the yelp page.  The quality of the stew was good, but the preparation of the kalbi tang was not. I told them that they should prepare the kalbi tang with the meat cut off, I mean the meat is one of the best parts oft he stew. I can never shake off the feelings of humiliation to return to this restaurant.  I give this place 3 stars because I know that they are new and have really good potential.",

In my Korean dramas, people are ALWAYS eating - kimchi fried rice, seaweed soup, seafood pancakes, and so on. After watching my favorite actors and actresses eat so much, I became curious about Korean food. A quick search on yelp brought me to Gogi.  Gogi is delicious. I'm not a Korean food connoisseur, and I cannot vouch on the authenticity of the food, but it's delicious. I had the oxtail soup and spicy pork belly - so flavorful!   However, I'll have to limit my visits to special occasions because this place is expensive! Maybe that's why my favorite characters get so excited when the boss takes them out to dinner...",

My second time was about a year after that and there was dramatic improvement.  The Korean chirashi was only $10 - cheapest I've had.  The portion was large but the salad part was mostly cabbage which is unusual and didnt taste as good.  Came back tonight (2 years later) and there was further improvement. That same Korean Chirashi had large slices of sashimi and some cabbage but this time lots of real mixed greens.  This time the amount of sweet spicy sauce was way too excessive and drowned the salad.  Their sauce is also sweeter than I prefer so I will need to ask for the sauce on side next time like how it is usually served. Easy fix and still cheap $11.  My tofu soup was decent and only $8.99.  Not sure if I like it enough to be back but it's a decent place overall.",

Well you might not be able to get all those here, but all is not lost.  I had a lot of reservations coming here, but it was a birthday dinner and I hadn't had Korean food in a while and was having major cravings. At first, I was a bit miffed by the prices, but all that soon melted away. We ordered family style with the pork belly, hot stone bulgogi bibimbap and budae jjigae (army style hot pot). The portions here are gigantic! The bibimbap is definitely made for at least 2 maybe 3 people, and the soup is made for more like 4-6. The food was also very good. Good level of spicy and weren't stingy on the sauces. Ban chan was also decent, although I thought the Kim chi was ok. Food got an A for tasty, and very reasonable prices...plus complimentary fresh fruit dessert!  I also enjoyed some drinks like makgeolli (banana is surprisingly a very delicious flavor recommended by our server) and hite. I was hoping for baekseju but alas, there was none. Service was excellent - very thorough, attentive and friendly.  Overall, a pretty solid place for Korean food and drinks in the Phoenix area with very reasonable prices. Menu isn't as expansive as I'd like but I'll definitely be returning and exploring more of the menu.  And I'm glad I've found an excellent place to satisfy my Korean food cravings. Oh and did I mention they play kpop too??",

Maybe a little light on the jalapeno. Seaweed salad was a thing of beauty and really delicious! Husband ordered kimchi soup, which was great and I don't normally like kimchi. We'll be going back for sure. Servers were very friendly and helpful.",

After trying her leftover Bibimbap, I thought, \"it can't be that bad\" and thankfully it wasn't. The dish I tried during my first visit was the buckwheat noodles in cold soy sauce. Despite being salty (what else to expect from soy sauce), I still enjoyed it. I hope in the future that they offer a Korean dish I tried in California before, where it was acorn noodles in cold soy milk broth garnished with a tomato wedge and julienne cucumber.",

The first time I went, a co-worker and I went for lunch before our shift and ordered some specialty rolls (don't remember the names but one was on a bed of flames) and some other meat and rice dish. Service was friendly and for the most part, attentive. Specialty roll was just alright... found it to be mostly mayonnaise and crab meat. Second time I went I went for dinner with 2 girlfriends and we had drinks, assortment of sashimi, and some pork belly. The server was AMAZING, very very kind and polite, even asked his name (which I unfortunately forgot) and conversed with him. However, this most recent visit, is the reason for this review. Came in with another co-worker before shift once again and were sat in the very corner of the restaurant. We weren't greeted for at least 10 minutes which wouldn't have been as big an issue were it not for us to take notice to our server standing around chatting and laughing with friends. As soon as he approached us his first statement was, \"are you ready to order?\" said impatiently. We said not quite and (still without any drinks) and he said, \"i'll come back,\" still without grabbing a drink order, or introducing himself. We had to ASK him for the sushi menu AND he had turned around so quickly to walk away i had to ask him if we could have waters before he was too far away. He came back one more time and we were ready to order, we ordered our meal without difficulty or confusion and once i finished talking and handed him the menu he snatched it from my hands and stared at me with a demeaning look. So obvious that even my friend asked if i knew him or if i noticed his mannerisms. Never refilled drinks, had to get up to the booth him and his fellow employee were sitting at, texting, and eating, to ask for a to-go box seeing as my friend and i were in a rush. He acted as if us interrupting his mid-day snack was so inconvenient for him. Sorry, let me come back when you are done eating okay? Anyways, i've had good and bad service from many places but this one was service bad enough to make me write this post at all.",

A definite part of our work lunch rotation when we're actually really hungry - because you get a lot of food - your order, the banchan, and sometimes some complementary egg. Sometimes someone in our group wants sushi while someone else hates sushi but will order the meats. So this place sort of satisfies everybody in the group. I usually get the Korean food choices. So far I've had the Fresh Water Eel Hot Stone Rice Bowl, the Spicy Pork Belly, Oxtail Soup, Kalbi, and probably a few I've forgotten. The food has always been good. We leave pretty satisfied each time. Service is sometimes very good and sometimes lacking but that's usually only when they're shorthanded. They have a handful of booths and a number of round tables that can seat four people. Two large screens that usually show news. This place is closer for us than Hodori and Chodang so that pretty much seals it that they will be the ones satisfying our Korean food cravings. It's in the same mall as Lee Lee's on the NE corner of Warner and Dobson. Parking is plentiful but watch out - the parking lot itself is a wreck! It's full of potholes and areas that are badly in need of resurfacing.",

The sweet and spicy chicken is mine and my friend's favorite, but we've also tried the garlic chicken which was a teeny bit sweet with chopped garlic on top which is also super good. The portion size is huge for the chicken!! And even if you get the  half-half chicken it is so worth the extra $2.99 because they don't cut out of the original portion size. All of the hot stone bibimbap options are great and you cant really go wrong there. We've also had the  soft tofu soup which was incredible flavor wise and kept warm throughout the meal. Every time we've been here the service has been the same waitress who is consistently friendly and always watches out for water that needs to be filled or if you need more sides. Definitely recommend!",

The bibimbaps had a higher topping to rice ratio than I'm used to, but the variety of veggies were fun and I really enjoyed it.The spicy pork didn't seem spicy in the slightest, but that could be because I doused my own food in gochujang.

I walked in on a wed lunch break and waited awkwardly at the front to be seated for a couple minutes. Once I got seated, things moved fairly fast. I couldn't decide between the bibimbap or the hot soondooboo, so I determined I'd get the combo which had both. Win win. Yay.  I liked their banchan and I loved loved loved their bibimbap. I got the mixed soondooboo spicy, where I found the meat in the soup to be actually very delightful whereas some places give you the trash meat in the soup. Kudos. Job well done GOGI.  Now. On to the stone dol-sot-bibimbap. WOWZER. The thing was bigger than my head. It was the size of a med pizza, which I ate without guilt. Funny isn't it? I would feel so horrid if I ate the same amount in pizza but felt weirdly satisfied when I ate the equivalent in a bibimbap? It is something you MUST try. I loved it and crushed it. I challenge you ;)",

This is a luxuriously perfect and exclusive prime example of the best that Korean food can offer. Everything I would hope for in taste, portion size, deliciousness and scrumptious ness were all very welly satisfied by this restaurant.   Waiter was good, was friendly once he noticed that we were not going to be tough on him.  ~ Don't expect anything you are not willing to give. Stop the cycle of hate by loving those who hate.  It is pricey ($50 for our family,), but if you feel like treating yourself or your family and want the most for your money. This will satisfy your stomach and fulfil your taste buds deepest desires.  We just moved from Los Angeles where we would eat at many restaurants all throughout the KoreaTown area.  Yet I could not recommend a better, perfect example of Korean food here in Arizona or in California.  Spend your money with those who deserve it. Help those who love others, your dollar will go further.   God bless you all,  Jo Family",

    "text": "I don't know if Gogi recently changed owners; I believe that I knew the family before who owned it--one girl used to go to my highschool--and the food here was delicious! I find it difficult to trust reviews of people who may not know Korean cuisine or may not be as familiar...but personally, the past few times I've been here, I haven't recognized the staff, which is fine as long as the food is good. However I've been seriously disappointed with the quality for an array of dishes and entrees.  The chicken bulgogi isn't that great: the chicken is quite dry and honestly, its the bare minimum amount of sauce that manages to make the dish salvagable if you can ignore the toughness. It's blatant that they didn't spend a lot of time with the actual cooking of the chicken and that there's barely any marinating.  On a separate occasion, I'd ordered the korean fried chicken, known for being fried twice, giving it the crispy, airy texture without being too soggy. While portion size was generous, the quality of the chicken was sub-par. The chicken was soggy and drenched in sauce, and there was no crispiness. I don't know what they did but the bones were crushed in almost EVERY piece despite being intact on the outside until I bit in. Finally, today (which will sadly probably be my last visit), I ordered the pork belly entree which seems simple enough and really hard to mess up (it's essentially bacon lol). Every piece of meat I had was tough and dry. There was absolutely no seasoning: I resorted to using soy sauce. No piece was consistent in cut size/thickness and was just taxing to eat.  I'm thoroughly disappointed since I used to have a lot of faith in the restaurant but after giving it multiple tries spaced out by several months, I won't be coming back again, especially given the price point for each dish.",

The spicy soup I ordered had no taste and barely any soup on there. And the whole bottom of the soup are all burnt. So I was eating burnt tofu and fish roe and the whole soup smelled burnt and tasted burnt. The raw spicy crab was okay i guess since idk how its suppose to taste like, but my boyfriend (a korean) said its rlly rlly plain except for being spicy). He ordered a cold noodle and it wasn't okay either. He also ordered surf clam sushi but the clam was not cleaned well, there's black stuff on top of it (it's part of the clam's stomach, but it should be clean for sushi).",

I guess you can say grandpa crashed their party. We ordered Spicy Pork Bulgogi with the accompanying sides of Kimchi of cabage,  marinated potato  and another kimchi of sweet potatoes, pickled beansprouts and one that had a fishy taste.  They all tasted very good except for the fishy one.  The pork dish was a good sized portion, not at all spicy and the meat had just a hint of freezer burn taste to it, but edible.  We decided that we were not fans of Korean cuisine.  Our friends ate Bibimbap, a heated stone bowled rice dish with meat and veggies and an egg on top.  They liked it a lot but were accustomed to this type of cooking. There was enough food for each couple to share a dish!  Please don't use my review to not eat here because the flavors were not great for us, I imagine it's an acquired taste.",

We ordered-the seafood pancake-not doughy, plenty of seafood and filling-so good. We also ordered OX knee soup and spicy pork neck potato soup. The names of both of these dishes grossed me out, but I had faith in my mother for ordering.    When the food arrived, it looked good. The taste was even better. This place is the real deal!!  I will definitely be back!",

BUT I came back after hearing the good reviews to verify for myself.  Gotta try the Hot Stone Bowls (beef, chicken, pork, or tofu).  Presentation was awesome. Your meat of choice is served on a bed of rice along side various  sauteed vegetables and topped with an over easy style egg. It comes out sizzling hot and you can hear the sound it makes like when you order a fajita dish at a Mexican restaurant. Huge portion so I had it for lunch and leftovers for dinner :)",

    "text": "I've been here numerous times since they've been open and each time their food never fails me, but customer service does! I haven't been here in about 6 months now and decided to come in for lunch with my aunt. While pulling up they had a \"Now Open\" sign.. haven't they been open for almost 2 years now? Am I miss something? As I walk up to the door they have a pretty tacky poster board that says \"We're open everyday\" that's awesome, when did they change that because I remember coming here several times and they were closed. I finally walk in and there's a sign that says please wait to be seated, so I'm standing there patiently waiting with my infant, staring at the server who's in the back who doesn't even notice me til I literally walk towards the back of their restaurant to go to their bathroom, which was weird and filthy, there's a random table and like some lawn mower looking thing under the table, I think that might be a hazard..  So while talking to our server, I guess they changed owners a few months ago, hopefully their customer service is better than the last and the food stays the same.  Our food comes out, everything is pretty delicious, then they began to get incredibly busy, we needed our check and a few boxes, we literally sat there while watching our server, the only server there handle 14 tables by himself, I felt bad for the kid.. But at the same time we needed our check and some boxes.. it literally took us 20 minutes to even get acknowledged, and we gave him the bill and he sat it down with some lady, randomly at the counter top, where it sat for another 15 minutes until my aunt went up there and asked the lady to run her card. The lady ran the card but charged us too much, we brought it to her attention, she didn't do anything about it and it took forever, so we didn't want to wait again, so we just told her the tip is what she over charged us with and threw in an extra 2 dollars on top of it.. Not sure if our server got the tip out of it, but I have a feeling he'd have a pretty crappy tip day anyways, all of the surrounding tables were complaining and wanting to leave too. I felt bad for him, but they need to manage their restaurant better and give this poor kid a helping hand.. hire some more help and get more organized,  or you guys will lose alot of business!   P.s. Food was still great though!",

    "text": "So, while the food here wasn't bad, the service, or rather lack-thereof is.   So, we were meeting with my in-laws here for dinner, and so my husband grabs the teeny, I grab the booster chair and diaper bag and we head in towards their table. All of a sudden, my foot flies out from behind me, and as I try to catch my balance, I end up smashing into a table full of hot food. (if you've had Korean food, you know that the majority of food is served scorching hot in burning hot stone bowls/dishes).  Seriously?! I'm not clumsy, and I felt so bewildered at what just happened....  Yeah, so what happened was one of the waiters had spilled something prior to our arrival and decided NOT TO CLEAN IT UP, and forgot about it. And not like a tiny little splash of water or something, it looked like a good sized dish of some dark black sauce had been upended in their entry way on their dark floor.   After the poor party whose table I had crashed into was ok, and I was ok - and felt terrible about almost falling into their food, as well as rolling my ankle while trying to catch my balance and having a minor burn/scratch on my finger (probably from contact with aforementioned stone bowl), I hurried to our table. At this point, I was pretty upset because WHO LEAVES A TON OF FOOD ON THE FLOOR at a restaurant?!?!? I usually am the one who holds our baby, too - and can you imagine what would have happened if I had been holding the baby when I slipped? Or what if it was my husband who had slipped instead of me?  I was expecting the waitstaff to be extremely apologetic for what happened. Uh, yeah no. The waiter who had spilled the sauce came up and basically said \"Oh, I'm so sorry, it was my fault. I didn't clean up the spill. You're ok?\" And that was IT.   Our actual waitress said NOTHING, didn't even check to see if I was ok. The manager? I don't know if they even have one, but no manager made an appearance. There was literally nothing done to remedy the situation, aside from the measly apology by the one waiter. If the restaurant staff had handled this situation differently, I would probably not feel so strongly as I do!  So yes, while the food was ok, my whole experience was completely ruined. On top of that, on a 50* night, all of the female waitstaff had on the shortest shorts. Seriously? Just poor taste and non-existant professionalism.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Gogi last night for dinner.  Both of us are familiar with Korean food, having eaten in restaurants in Seoul (Sinchon), Tennessee, Mesa, and the Las Vegas Strip, as far as Korean style food.  Bottom line we know how Korean food tastes.  My wife ordered Thick Noodle Soup (Kimchi).  She did not have a problem with the level of spice or the kimchi.  Probably the fact that the taste being strong then what we had in Seoul, South Korea is a regional difference of the chef.  The thing that really did get to her was the fact that the noodles were severely undercooked.  My wife is Asian, and knows how noodles are supposed to be in soup.  They were not al dente.  They were severely undercooked.  I ate Soon Tofu Seafood (Soondubu).  Compared to what I have eaten elsewhere in the East Valley for Korean food, and what I have eaten in Seoul, South Korea for similar, the soup's taste was totally off.  They need to learn to cook it.    We also ate one order of Maki Sushi, Spicy Tuna Roll.  Based upon what we got we barely found the sushi edible.  It was not even up to par to what we have eaten in places here in Arizona, yet alone elsewhere.    As far as the service it is slow.  It took me nearly three times over the course of 0.5 hour to get my check delivered to me at the end of the meal, and just as long for them to acknowledge that it was ready for processing.  There is absolutely no organization or division of the duties as far as who is running the place.  Also, the way they do housekeeping sucks.  They need to go study how things are done in Seoul (South Korea) at some restaurant, and they can see how to be efficient, and be clean.    As a result, my wife and I will most likely not return to Gogi for Korean food.  We will go elsewhere in The Valley for Korean food, unless we are in Seoul (and we travel often enough to South Korea).    We definitely advise this place to improve.  You can not compete with doing the status quo.",

It was probably the service, since they forgot about our ban chans, not enough silverware, and we were missing a few bowls of rice.  I would recommend the bulgogi, since the meat was tender.  The spicy squid was okay, I felt like it was missing its authentic taste.  It was probably the inattentive service we received, that's why i'm giving it a 3. I would probably return here again to give it another try.",

I had the shrimp bimbibap and the shrimp was overcooked and tasteless, not clean and chewy. The \"hot\" sauce was not hot. I had to pour it again and again to get any flavor and spice. Definitely not real hot sauce. The appetizers were even bad and lacked variety. Heck, even the water was terrible.   I'm so disappointed with the changes and won't be back.

The other flavor I got was the Garlic chicken!  The flavor was good but the chicken was borderline dry..  and I wish they mix the chicken pieces better.. all the white meat had the red sauce and while the garlic chicken had all the dark meat..   Overall, I would have given it a 3.5 but I rounded it up to 4 for speed and customer service.   Can't find a menu for it anywhere online so I took a picture for y'all.",

I don't know a lot about Korean food but wanted to try a little bit of everything. I've had beef bulgogi before but I noticed they had a spicy pork option as well. It is served with the small plates of pickled vegetables and rice. We also ordered the garlic fried chicken and the spicy fried chicken. Don't mix it up with KFC or Popeyes. The batter is still crunchy but much dinner. It seems like they both use a similar sweet glaze. I was hoping to taste more garlic but all three of us ended up dipping those pieces in the hot sauce. Your hands will be sticky when done. We started off with potstickers. These tasted like what I get out of the freezer section at Trader Joes but it was an easy munchy to share. Tried the beef and vegetable stew but that sat at the table and ended up taking it home. The broth has a very unique flavor but not enough spices for me to enjoy. It tasted more like hot water with tender meat. I think I went in expecting more of a pho type taste but liquid was just in the bowl not something that  I would be excited to finish up. It looks like they get a decent dinner crowd and people even order sushi to go. The menu has a good mix of asian dishes in general so I'm sure everybody could find something. If I go back I would get the chicken again and maybe find a new entree to try.",

Total Bill: $35 lunch; $55 dinner  Level of Satisfaction: High Mediocre  Quick Tips:   - Do not eat here for dinner.  Portions are the same as lunch and cost nearly twice as much.   - We never get personal or really good service here.  Just mediocre.  We are ratings Gogi 3 stars but we want to elaborate.  If we were just rating the food, they get a 5 stars hands down.  The food is so good and the only thing we have had but didn't enjoy was the fish katsu.  It had way too many bones to truly enjoy.  But the bibimbap, the bulgogi, and galbi all will make your mouth water just to write about.  Yes, I'm salivating now!  The service however.  Not so great.  Seems like you need to be a \"friend of the family\" to get really good service.  We almost feel not welcome walking in.  The second complaints is the difference between dinner and lunch prices.  After originally going for a lunch and then returning for another visit at dinner time, we clearly noticed the huge bill and lack of larger portions.  So overall...totally worth a visit but set reasonable expectations and only go for lunch.",

    "text": "GOGi has been my \"GO TO\" for Korean food since I arrived in Chandler, AZ, and I have to say this place is one of the most authentic Korean places in the eastern valley/Phoenix area. Luckily, during my stay here in Chandler it turned out to be 5 minutes from my house. I find myself eating a lot more Korean food these days and loving it!  I am originally from the Orange County, CA area and I am a Korean/American Hapa so I have some insight and judgment skills regarding authentic Korean cuisine. My father and aunties were first generation from Seoul and frequently cooked for our family. My favorite Auntie Jung would often prepare and serve extra Japchae for me at family gatherings or for my birthday celebrations.  Essentially, GOGi can best be described in 3 words \"Authentic, fresh, and delicious!\"  The Food is: well spiced, but not too much garlic. I mean the next day your friends won't be like, \"Shit, what the hell did you eat last night?\" The Japchae, Kim Chee Pancakes, Bulgogi, Bibimbap, and Soft Tofu spicy soup are all authentic and delicious. My boyfriend Seth and good friend Aimee enjoyed the fresh fish salad, and also found it to be delicious, authentic, and fresh also. Oh yes, and the portion is huge on this dish, so plan to share unless you are especially hungry.  The Side Dishes: (know as banchan): are delicious including the fresh Kim Chee, and when I say fresh I mean it! I called to inquire about purchasing sides of Kim Chee to have around my house for my boyfriend and I to enjoy with our Asian Fusion meals at home. However, they responded in saying they would run out of Kim Chee if they sold it that way. What run out of Kim Chee?!!! That would be unethical to rob some poor soul of their fresh Kim Chee experience. No way!!!!  The Portions: again, GOGI serves the most generous portions I have ever encountered when dining Korean Cuisine, and I have eaten Korean all over the place!  The Atmosphere: your standard authentic Korean atmosphere: bizarre deco that makes no sense lol, many Korean servers speaking Korean amongst themselves and smiling and bowing a lot. You may even see monitors or big screens without any sound or with Korean videos, if you are lucky haha! You may here authentic Korean music in the background.   The Service: was awesome! My servers always approach me smiling and eager to help and understand my order. The last time I went in late night with my boyfriend after drinking way too many drinks the server complimented me-Wow! What more can you ask for. Try this place-It's Authentic, fresh, and delicious Korean cuisine!",

Maybe they need more servers, but we had to work super hard all throughout to finally get their attention. Even when we finally got their attention, they always miss to bring or remember what we've asked. We literally had to ask more than three times each time. We had no side dishes served, we asked a few times to set the table (utensils, cups), they served only partial of our food. They kept forgetting to serve us something until we finally got their attention. Anyways, it was an exhaustive experience.",

It's a little farther from my house, but worth the drive.  We had the galbi and seafood soon dubu combo, and the ox knee soup. The seafood in the soon dubu was plentiful and the galbi portion was also very filling. My ox knee soup was a lot larger than I expected, so I didn't have a chance to finish, and it also came with a generous portion of knee cartilage and the sweet/tangy dipping sauce that comes with it. Overall, the quality of the food was great and service was good. Definitely going to be coming back here to try more items off their menu.",

Gotta say I wasn't disappointed! :)  The interior is spacious, nice and clean; unlike other typical smoky asian/korean BBQ places. The staff was very attentive and helpful. We ordered the spicy pork bellies and spicy squid and pork bellies with rice combos. Our orders came out about 10-15 mins afterward with all the side dishes. I specifically really enjoyed the steamed eggs. On the other hand, I didn't care too much for the sausage side dish.   The only thing I was confused was the fact that my spicy pork bellies combo and my dad's spicy squid and pork bellies combo cost the same. Look at the picture you will understand. My dad's order was almost double my order size.   Overall, everything was great! Food was really tasty. Awesome service. Nice ambient. Decent price. Will definitely come back and recommend to others.",

I have never felt so disrespected as a loyal customer until my experience tonight. First, we were seated before two other families, however those two families got menus and water before us. We kept having to \"flag\" our servers down to help us with anything we needed. When we politely asked if we could order since we usually get the same thing, our server seemed hesitant to put our order in. We asked for our plates (so we could actually eat) and the server rudely tossed it on the side of our table and rushed to go help another table. I was appalled!!! We were checked on ONCE. Finally we just asked for our check and a to go box because we about had it with the service (and also how hot it was in there) I told my husband to just wait in the car with our kids. 5 minutes go by.. then 10.. I kept raising my hand to flag a server down and all THREE of them ignored me, even the owner was right next to me by the bar and didn't say anything. Finally I just got up and got my own to go box and plastic behind the bar. On my way back to the table I still kept trying to get a servers attention for my check that I had asked for 20 minutes ago. STILL NOTHING. Finally, I'm able to catch the attention of one of them but guess what!!! The owner also grabs her attention to tell her to go to the table behind me because they needed a to go box. WOW. Just wow. I'm home now but I'm honestly still shaking. I finally get my check, no apology, nothing. I will not be returning here. I'd rather take my business to Gen where they treat all their customers equal.",

Since it is served in the hot stone, the rice on the bottom caramelizes and has a nice crispy texture.  We shared a lot of different dishes on our visit here. In addition to the hot stone bowl, we got the omelet appetizer, buckwheat noodle with sashimi, beef bulgolgi, and tofu salad. The omelet appetizer was a large roll of egg and veggies, good but nothing too special. The buckwheat noodle was served cold, in a more al dente texture, covered with spicy red sauce. While I enjoyed the noodles, a sashimi piece I ate had some cartilage or gristle on it, and the dish was so overwhelmingly covered with sauce that it tended to overpower the rest of the ingredients.  The beef bulgolgi was good, but it seemed like a smaller portion that what I'm used to (Or maybe it looked small due to the huge size of the hot stone bowl). The tofu salad was excellent. It had a delicate taste from the silky firm tofu slices, drizzled with a tangy, lightly sweet dressing, with fresh greens.  Service was excellent and the waitress was very cheerful and friendly.",

The galbi on the other was pretty unsatisfying because the meat was so fatty! Every bite I took was like a piece of fat which made me feel like I'm going to get a heart attack. The tofu soup itself was a 3..it's more on the sweeter side then I would like and the beef was very chewy.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch today, feasted like a beast, and I was pretty much rolled out... towards a few doors away for some gelato as dessert.  Don't judge me.  After escaping the near 100-degrees that makes up an Arizona April day, we were promptly sat down in an intimate booth.  The atmosphere was very simplistic and classy.  We were given a menu for Korean and a sushi list on the side.  After observing an impressive selection, we ordered tako su, soft shell crab, and two stone rice bowls [fresh water eel and caviar].  Had I known my lunch date wanted a stone bowl, I would've chosen something else so we can try more items.  Don't you hate it when that happens?  The tako su appetizer consisted of five piece of steamed octopus tentacles dressed in lots of Japanese vinegar.  It was a pretty toothsome little piece of octopus and wasn't anything spectacular. I don't really recommend it.  Soft shell crab appetizer was pretty standard.  It's not exactly San Francisco where they fry the whole blue crab with legs and all.  I'm sure the legs were used for spider rolls so you really just get the body of the crab.  Once again, nothing spectacular and wouldn't order it again.  The hot stone rice bowls though, that's love.  They actually serve it in the stone rice bowls!  A lot of places around the valley gets away with serving their rice bowls in metal bowls but this place has your rice, veggies, goodies, and egg on the stone bowl.  It was sizzling and crackling for a long while.  This thing is hot!  For $16, I would come back for the rice bowl alone.  Note:  the advertised caviar was really just smelt roe they use in sushi.    Overall I had a great and filling lunch.  Service was fast and friendly, food was decent, and I will totally be back to try their actual lunches.  Our total bill was $52.  Not bad for two appetizers and two entrees!",

I ordered some sake ( the sweetest cold one they have) and it was Amazing! Our food came out super fast and I really liked the little condiment bowls that came to the table. The salmon was amazing.

So we decided to try this place out because we all love Korean food anyways, and so glad we did!  The food is great, can't go wrong with Korean food. We ordered a seafood pancake, two hot stone bowls, a galbi and tofu soup combo, and a tempura udon.  The food was good and we were so stuffed...had way too much food for two people. I could of shared that hot stone bowl with someone. But, that also means korean food again for lunch the next day :)  The side dishes were super delicious. Loved the steamed egg in a bowl, the spinach, and the bean sprouts!! Those are always my favorite. I asked for so many refills of those..I felt bad. But that gets me to their service. Our waitress was so nice and attentive, and always had a smile on her face! She didn't mind at all that I kept asking for bean sprouts, and she ended up giving me a to-go box full of them!!! Ahhhhh, that made my night.   The entire time we were there, we only saw Koreans dining, or at least Asians, so I think that's a good sign that there's some legit Korean food.",

I love that their hot stone bowl is made in a way that makes the rice in the bottom crispier than usual (I don't know if that's possible) but it makes the whole dish more amazing. There's just enough amount of meat, vegetables and rice. My boyfriend had pork belly and it literally melted in their mouths. The complimentary appetizers are great.

Didn't wait long initially for our server to come by and take our drink orders but it did take a while to come back with it.  We decided the normal stuff, seafood pancake, kalbi, bulgogi, chap chae, and chicken katsu for the kids.  They have the normal side dishes like other places so that is cool.  Nothing really stands out but like I said, I love Korean food.  I really judge Korean restaurants by its chap chae, and this place had pretty good chap chae.  Large servings didn't hurt either.  Prices are normal when it comes to Korean food.  I feel that it is pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I will probably be back when I have that craving.",

The beef fried rice comes with a fried egg atop and it was surprisingly good. It's hard to find a good place that makes delicious fried rice and these guys definitely got it on the mark. The bibimbap was also really flavorful, and cause of the stone pot the rice gets crispy on the bottom to scrape up like how you dig for screenshots to expose someone. The KFC is served after 5PM fyi so come thru to get destroyed, you ain't down. The sauce was really good and the chicken breading was crispy. Definitely happy I came back cause I'll be back soon.",

First of all, unlike other kbbq places we were seated right away and service was great! Unfortunately the flavor of their food didn't catch me. The Bulgogi we ordered wasn't piping hot and Galbi was tougher than usual. My son ordered shrimp fried rice which he loved along with the fish cake banchan.

Everyone there is as friendly as can be but at busy times they just seem to be all over the place, rushing and sometimes forgetting things. My recent experience with them though has completely won me over.  A few months ago i went there with some family and friends, at least 15 of us. It was a busy  night and we were seated in the patio. They didn't seem like they could handle all the tables there that night and was really slow throughout the whole dinner: providing utensils, bringing out food, ringing up the bill. They realized that they provided poor service and promised us 20% off on our next visit (written on a receipt.)   Months after that night, I went back with my family. Same large party, but completely different experience. We expected to just have the same dishes that we normally get (we can't get enough of that Sweet Pork Belly.) Soon after we placed our orders we realized that they remembered us from last time we visited. While we waited for our orders, they brought a few things for us to try. Steamed egg, seafood pancakes, and chicken katsu salad. They said that they wanted to make up for last time and that those were all on the house. Service was much better this time around with multiple waiters being attentive and when we got the check, they already took 20% off and just asked me to turn in the note he gave us last time.   Like I said, food is always great here. What they lacked in customer service in previous visits they more than made up for this time around. It was a classy gesture and I appreciate that they appreciate their customers.",

We had a nice man be our server and he did a good job asking us if we had questions the menu was a little confusing and I wish they had pictures because of the descriptions were not all entirely clear. When we ordered our drinks they came in a can where we had to pour it in the cup, I was not a huge fan of that at all because while we were waiting for our food we were never asked if we wanted a refill or knew how that worked. The food came out in a timely manner and looked very nice with the plating, my bibimbap was good but it was not the best I've had since I felt like it was premade ahead of time a long time ago versus making it right then and there, my hubby's bulgogi was very good the meat was tender and had good flavor but he was not found of the chopsticks as he struggled. As we were having our meals we were never asked if we wanted a refill and as I looked for the sever he was in the corner talking to the other servers and not paying attention to us as we were the only other people in the restaurant and it was not busy at all.  As the bill came out it was written in Korean and we couldn't understand what we were charged for.... I wish they had something where we could see our bill since our bill was a little high. To be courteous we did tip our server but we probably won't be going back for a little while unless we are craving bulgogi but I'll pass on the bibimbap",

    "text": "I didn't read the reviews beforehand - just from the pics alone I knew I had to try this place! I hadn't had much Korean beyond some bulgogi and the typical ban chan, so I was excited to try something new!  My group of four went on a Thursday evening, 7pm. It was rather quiet, only two or three small parties. The service was great! The waitresses were attentive and sweet, without hovering, and the food came quickly.  The food was DELICIOUS! I appreciated the pictures from Yelp, as the menu didn't have any. That'd be my only suggestion for GOGI, to design a new menu with pics for the inexperienced or those who pick by what visually speaks to them in the moment.  My man and I shared the hot stone bibimbap and seafood soon tofu. Loved the mix between the crispy rice at the bottom and the runny, savory yolk of the fried egg. The flavor of the soon tofu was rich and spicy without too much heat, and was balanced wonderfully by the soft tofu that gave it a velvety texture. $16, and there was plenty of food for two!  By the time we left, around 9, the place was getting busy! We're already planning the next visit!",

The seaweed wrapper was chewy to the point of frustration to eat it, which marred the entire sushi experience.  All the rolls were average taste-wise.  The Unagi was served cold. The waitress never asked if we wanted drinks other than the water we initially received.   All around a negative experience, and I doubt that I will return.",

Last night, the place was packed with Korean families who could be making their own Korean food at home, but obviously weren't bc this place is out of this world.  The service is sketchy, but the food is the highlight. Don't let the bad service keep you away from the delightfulness your taste buds deserve. The flavor here is full bodied and inviting. I never say this, but it's better than the Korean food I had growing up in a Korean American household. THERE, I SAID IT. *drops mic, walks away*. (My mother was an amazing cook, too)  We usually order the pork hot stone bowl (bibimbap); it comes out piping hot and stays that way. If you order a hot stone bowl, be willing to share or don't eat for several days before; it's a huge serving. One serving could easily feed 3 people. I wish I knew the right words to describe how tasty it is.  The haemul pajun was hot, crispy, and not so thick. It was the most homestyle pajun I've eaten at a Korean restaurant. Like the hot stone bowl, this is also a generous portion I'd order this as a meal and eat it all by myself. Ok, I'm a liar. If it didn't make me look like a pig, I'd order 2... All to myself.   We also had the Korean chirak. If you like sashimi, you'll love this dish. It's like bibimbap, but the fish is raw and it's served  in sliced red cabbage-like a salad. You get rice, on the side, to add in if you want. The sashimi was creamy, like butter, and incredibly fresh. You also got a lot of it. The cabbage paired perfectly with the sashimi. The sauce was a nice balance of spiciness with a hint of sweetness.",

I stumbled into Gogi because I was on my way to Lee Lee Market to pick up some ingredients for a meal I was going to cook this weekend and had to give it a try.  I usually always order Galbi as the first meal at any Korean restaurant so I can have a baseline to compare.  It was good, the quality of the short ribs were decent, not too fatty and not much gristle.  The portion for $21 was average to other Korean restaurants. I thought it was going to be huge because my wife's Bibimbap bowl, which came out first, was enormous.  The banchan was good, nothing special.  I was happy when I asked if they had Kkakdugi and they were able to bring some out of the back!! All in all it was a solid Korean restaurant and I would gladly come back.",

Service was alright, nobody really checked on us which sucks but they are busy and mostly Asian people :)    We ordered Bulgogi which is a sweet Korean BBQ rib eye, very tasty. The shrimp fried rice was very good, it comes with a sunny side egg which was a lil weird but was good, and these two things together are plenty to share.  They also served small side plates with cabbage, tofu, spinach,  bean sprouts and one other thing.   We also got a philidephia roll which was excellent,  quite a big larger then other places and the st uff with more salmon and cream cheese.    All in all, place was pretty good however their soda is canned and tasted like a soda that had been in the sun.  They Defintely need soda on a gun. We will be back :)",

Ordered Kalbi and bulgogi thinking it was the $9.99 price like it shows on the menu... It's not. The guy on the phone didn't tell me the price before I hung up so I went to pick up my order and paid $47!!!! Lol honestly it's my fault for not confirming the price. The only reason for the 3 stars is based on how much I paid for only two things, the portion for to-go wasn't that big and the amount of rice they gave was sad :( I went home and made more rice in my rice cooker. but hey, the food was good! Anddd the guy who help me was really nice.  *** I see the reviews are saying the portions they got were huge but idk mine just wasn't? Maybe because I ordered Togo?",

Service is quick (almost too much so) and efficient if not overly friendly.  Don't hesitate to ask questions as the staff is helpful to newcomers but most of the people there seemed to be very regular patrons. It's that good. We had hot stone bibimbap bulgogi(beef) and pork and cabbage dumplings. Dumplings were as would be expected not dense with meat but lighter due to cabbage mixture. The hot stone bibimbap was out of this world hot(temperature not spice). I love my hot food hot and the stone kept it that way until we packed the leftovers! We even shared and still had leftovers so it's plenty of food. The rice base continues to cook and gets deliciously crunchy the longer it sits. Ingredients seem high quality and fresh.",

I brought the hubby here for his birthday because we like to try new places and were craving Korean food. SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE!   The reviews had people complaining about the service or the time it takes for the food to come out.  Service was actually pretty decent for a Korean place. They were friendly and always working and kept busy. When I really needed something I was able to stop someone and they brought it right away.  The food did take a bit, but it wasn't even as long as most other Korean places I have been to. Everything is always made when it is ordered and quality food takes a while. I make this type of food at home and it is an all day event. Everything we ordered was really good and reminded me of my father's cooking when he was alive.   Our table was visited by an awesome sweet lady and we thought she was the owner, turns out she is his sister and was just helping out for the night.  We will definitely be making this place our go to for Korean food! And it saves me from having to spend all day in the kitchen. Don't be discouraged by timing, just make sure you have plenty of time to enjoy.",

I don't want to nitpick but honestly I have to. Tempura is fried I get it but it shouldn't be greasy. So greasy it ran down my face when I bit into it.   We had servings of seafood and pork tofu soup. I recommend the seafood as the pork soup the meat was very dry and didn't work with the soup.   In addition we had the shrimp, bulgogi and spicy pork hot stone. I recommend the spicy pork - the bulgogi I got a taste of too much sesame oil but maybe it was an off day. The hot stone bowls are so generous that it could feed a small village. Some days I'm that small village.   Drinks are pretty standard. I didn't have any but my friends had some soju which was said to be room temperature when they got their shot glass but I imagine it would have been decent chilled. They weren't bombing it into their beer glasses.   The ban chan was lacking but there was enough ordered items to fill our hungry souls. It didn't look appetizing and starting to get that grey - I've been sitting in the cold too long look.   We took our other friends here for the first time and they enjoyed it so much they went back within the week to try other dishes.   The atmosphere and service: Still clean and acceptable. I am self conscience and I felt welcome here and the staff appeared to be very humble and welcoming compared to my first time here. I have yet to use the bathrooms here but I'm told they are pretty clean. Hoping for my next return to be 5 stars.   What I would change: egg souffle all day - they didn't have any and my aunt who doesn't consume meats was super sad.",

We were quickly seated in a booth and the waitress brought us the menus and some water. The water was great and it did not take like tap water. The menu was pretty big and had a wide selection of Korean foods.   They do have a lunch special and I opted on getting the galbi with steamed white rice. The lunch special also came with the traditional side dishes. (Kimchi, cucumber)  We also ordered an extra steamed egg, some cold noodle soup, and a steamed egg.   The steamed egg was DEEELICIOUS. The hot pot was filled to the brim and the egg tasted so good and it was so fluffy.   The cold noodle soup wasn't cold enough and it was way to sweet. The sauce they put in it was too strong. The portion was big though, and it can easily be shared within two people.   Our server was running around like crazy but she still managed to check up on us a few times. I believe it was only two employees tending tables and it was starting to get really busy for the lunch hour.   We never got the side of white rice that we had ordered, but when we got our bill, they were still charging us for it. We flagged down the server that had brought over the check, and he nicely said he would take it off, thank you.   My food was great and the meat had so much flavor! I will definitely be back to try out the rest of their dishes!",

This is the second time within the past year we've came to eat and both occasions we noticed a super weird smell coming from the food. First time was the sullung tang and as soon as they delivered it to the table, I could not stop gagging. It was almost like a rotten mildew smell coming from the soup. We went to eat again today and this time got soon doo boo and it also had that same weird funk to the food. I don't think I'll ever come back because you shouldn't have to question the quality of the food you're eating because of a weird smell every time.",

I ordered a beef rice cake soup upon recommendation, but can't say that I was extremely impressed. The bowl was mostly filled with bland broth and green onions, with less meat and rice cakes than I was expecting. Of the meat that was there, most of the pieces were extremely fatty.   My friend ordered a chicken bibimbap. When I tried a bite, I could see why people were so impressed with the restaurant! So much flavor and variety, and a huge portion of food at a good price.  I will be coming back to give the restaurant another try. Next time, I'll be ordering bibimbap!",

They serve it on a hot stone do the rice gets a little crispy. We also got the fried chicken-regular and sweet and spicy. Regular was fine (a little under seasoned) but the other was quite good and made for some excellent leftovers. I deducted a star for the staff closing up all the tables around us (chairs propped on tables, sweeping the floor) a good 15-20 minutes before their 10pm closing. I get wanting to get out ASAP, but you start that after the close time, not before. Still, I would definitely go back!",

Pros:  Good food, even the kimchi pancake that did not sound very enticing was actually good.  Not so much:  Seating was super tight, with a very long booth bench for a big group. It was pretty uncomfortable and not practical at all.  Temperature was uncomfortable as well. There was a thermostat right in the room and it never brought the temperature down to a comfortable level.  Service: Although the staff was friendly, I barely saw them check on us, we were working hard to get their attention most of the time. I asked for water to drink and please forget about refills. Then I asked for a soda and they only had cans, so no refills either. I could have drank about 3-4 cans throughout the night but since it was such a hassle to get them I ended up drinking just one.  Weird. We had a few hotpots on the table, which were also good, but they did not provide ladles with them. We used our chopsticks (you would not enjoy your meal if you are a germophobe) and spoons from other dishes.   Overall it was an interesting experience. Not very accommodating to my  dietary preferences, but the food was still good.",

I love Korean food and it's hard to leave a lasting impression on me since I try to eat it as much as possible but this place was so good. The meats were so tasty and portions are a lot. We got the bulgogi and galbi with a side of Kim chee fried rice. It was so good! Great to go with friends or families because it is family style portion size. We had so much left overs which we did finish the next day.   Wish I had room to try the soups, mandoo and Kim chee pancake but if ever I'm in the area again I'll definitely be back!",

My only complaint is the soups sometimes it can be bland but most of the time it's amazing. Love that they have the soon tofu combo so you don't break the bank getting multiple items.   Our order always consist of the seafood pancake and we always ask it for extra crispy and lemme tell you, that's a game changer.   Other favorite items is of course the galbi, spicy pork bulgogi, and spicy chicken!   There's always plenty of side dishes and they come with unlimited refills.

But I feel like they should mention that it's enough chicken for a family of six. Fourteen pieces!  Craig: Full-sized pieces of chicken. Legs, thighs, random chunks.   Me: Yeah, it was at least whole chicken cut up. Maybe more. That said, for that price, it's a helluva deal.   Craig: And super tasty. But also very sticky and hard to eat.   Me: They had to bring us extra napkins two or three times.  Craig: But we really needed wet naps.   Me: And those plates. OMG. Apparently they don't intend for you to share these vast, family-style dishes. Those plates were tiny.   Craig: It would maybe fit a half a corn cob.   Me: Yeah, I felt like a giant eating off some puny human's plate. There was just no room.   Craig: What was your favorite?  Me: I think it was the sweet pork belly. The flavor was amazing, and it was the simplest to eat. Though it was a little bit fatty. How about you?  Craig: I agree. And it fit really well on those tiny plates.   Me: I expected to like the bibimbap best, but it was actually the most bland for me. Still good with a little hot sauce. Just not as flavorful as the other dishes. What did you think of the restaurant itself? It seemed a little run down to me.   Craig: Yeah, especially if you go to the back where the bathrooms are. A little rundown but not unpleasant.   Me: The service was great, though.   Craig: Our waitress helped us pick delicious foods and kept us supplied with water and napkins.   Me: I feel like she could have mentioned we were ordering enough food to feed a small army, but otherwise she was great. How many stars?  Craig: I think four probably.   Me: I agree. With larger plates and some wet naps it might be four and a half.   Craig: And very reasonably priced for the amount of food. We had four take-home boxes.",

We asked for a refill of the side dishes and the Asian waitress never came back to service us. To all you foodies I Do not recommend this restaurant. The Sashimi was horrible at $ 19.99 and the Bulgogi was okay nothing to jump up and down. Out here on Yelp you find a couple more Korean food restaurants with awesome service and better authentic tasting Korean food with the taste from Korea. I will let all my ass Hayes k ow not to eat here Thank you.",

The meat was juicy/tender. I know most restaurants don't give you extra charge for wanting more rice, this restaurant does, but its all good.  Randomly our waitress gave us steamed egg soup that we didn't order and said \"It's on the house\". That's awesome! Thank you! And when we were halfway done with our meal, she gave us another order of the egg steamed soup and said \"Since you have a bigger party, we'd like to give you another\" which was awesome. Thank you again!  The service was good!",

Last time I went to the restaurant, it took a while to receive our order and they forgot the small dishes that I needed to ask for them- which was fine cause they were under staffed. But today, I was seated, waited for more than 10 mins- oh I checked my phone so I was very sure I waited for mk ore than 10 mins- no water, no menu no utensil. Me and my family was completely ignored- even when we stood up and waved our hands to raise attention of the waitresses... The understaffed situation has become ridiculous. I give it two stars because the food is still good...if you have time to wait and don't care about poor service",

    "text": "Thought this was a sushi restaurant though I should have known better based off the name. (Gogi means meat in Korean)  Our party of three got the 3 Soondubu stews and the Bibimbap. (Friend's Pork Bulgogi never arrived but it was waived from the final check) I thoroughly enjoyed my Beef Soondubu as it was a boiling hearty bowl of goodness filled with a whole egg and tofu. I never received gochujang (spicy red pepper paste) for my bibimbap but I had fun dipping the rice into the soup so I ended up not missing it that much. Sadly I left my to-go box of the bibimbap at the nearby Boba House so I didn't really get to experience the dish in it's fullest form.  Prices here are similar to the other Korean restaurants in the area with $10-$15 prices for most dishes. Their banchan selection is average with five sides offered.  Service is a little slow as they seem to be understaffed during the lunch rush and you may be forced to flag them down with some waving to get some attention.   Overall I like this place way better then Hodori and on par with Chodang and the other  Korean restaurants in Glendale. A good addition to the Lee Lee's neighborhood and I'm sure they'll work out their consistency issues.",

The food tastes good but it doesn't give you the \"wow\" factor that you're looking for in a 4-star review.  I went with my family started with two appetizers, Korean omelet and seafood pancake. I've never had a Korean style omelet before and I wouldn't say it's my favorite dish (at least at GOGI). It was very satly and there was too much fish sauce. The texture of the egg was really good though. The seafood pancake is usually my staple appetizer every time I go try a new Korean restaurant and at GOGI the pancake came out to be average. The flour mix is a bit heavy and about 60% of the pancake was full of long green onions. Judging by the pictures on Yelp, maybe I was unlucky and their mix on that day had too much green onion. At least the flavor was good and the pancake was crispy, though. The awesome thing about the pancake is the abundance of \"seafood\". Almost every bite had a piece of tasty squid!  I then ordered the soon tofu combo: hot stone bibimbap (my staple entree) and pork soup with white base (non-spicy). It was pretty good; the bibimbap taste like what it should be with very crispy edges. The amount of flavor and saltiness was good. I usually don't order soon tofu's so I'm not expert, but the soup was okay. The pork pieces were a bit hard and dry but the base was very clean and tasty.   I would love to return to GOGI to try out different dishes so I can re-adjust my reviews accordingly. As a first-timer experience, GOGI did not turn me away.",

We wanted to try just the Korean dishes so we could compare.  1. Korean Omelet Appetizer: If you like egg dishes then this is a must try.  Cooked perfectly (little wet - the way I like it) and flavor was fresh and was seasoned just right.  2. Fresh Water Eel Hot Stone Rice Bowl: Generous portion of one of my favorite dishes.  Rice and vegetables were perfectly balance and the sauce was superb.  The sunny side egg and eel on top was great.  Stir together with your preferred qty of sauce at the table and you will not be disappointed.  3. Galbi: great flavoring and cut.  Only complaint was I wished there was more.  4. Spicy Beef Stew:  Good balance of hotness and flavor.    My favorite part of our visit was the service.  The three girls that took our order and served our table were all extremely friendly and sincerely wanted to make our dinner memorable and enjoyable.  Our water glasses were never empty and the sides and rice were always continually offered.  Even one of our friends arrived late at closing time and they made him feel welcomed and brought him plenty rice and sides as he joined us.  Will definitely be back!",

They weren't super busy for either lunch or dinner even though we had parties of 7/10 people which was nice. The food itself was pretty solid and it's one of the first places I've seen that serves KFC (Korean fried chicken) and kbbq together! I recommend getting a seafood pancake to start off which is enough to give a solid piece to 6 people.   We ordered a myriad of food to try a little bit of everything such as galbi, spicy pork, bugolgi and their Korean fried chicken as well! All the meats are solid although not amazing (Galbi seemed a little over cooked and not as tender as it could be). The bibimbap itself is a large portion and was way more food than I could finish by myself. Solid place to get KBBQ although I usually prefer AYCE...",

Traditional Korean food, big flavor, big portions, friendly prices. Service is laid back and friendly. Stone bowl bibimbap was sizzling and savory...I'm getting a hunger pain just thinking about it. Good bulgogi. Kimchi fried rice good. Ban chan dishes were good. Some Japanese items on the menu like teriyaki and katsu style fish/chicken.   Don't forget to share some Soju with a friend! Or by yourself, I'm not judging..  Depending on what mood your in, make sure u consider trying  Gogi. If your tastebuds are looking for the equivalent of your favorite sweatpants, go here...it is comforting, low maintenance, and satisfying AF.",

The dishes and banchan are quality and delicious. My favorites are the seafood tofu soup, the seafood pancake, and kalbi. Yummm.

I highly recommend the green onion fried chicken which comes with a pile of shredded green onions and a wasabi dipping sauce. Of course, the usual spicy fried chicken is also delicious.  My second favorite dish here is the beef brisket soup. Its comfort food to me when it's cold outside or you just want something simple. I prefer the brisket soup to the rib soup because the flavor was better. You would think they would be the same and maybe it was the day I went but I thought the brisket soup had a more homemade flavor and of course more meat to eat. It is also served with a large cup of chopped green onions.  Their hot stone bibimbaps are great and so are the soon tofu soups. I used to go to the korean place north of downtown Chandler for tofu soup but Gogi's are better and you don't have to wait forever for a table.  What is also awesome? This place is open until 1am on the weekends. In the mood for some K-Pop and KFC, hit this place. You won't be disappointed.",

Then, she motioned for me to come over to the table once it was cleaned. The restaurant was busy and it took a little while for me to give my order to the waiter. They were so busy they didn't get a chance to check on me or ask if I wanted more of the banchan.  I ordered the beef tofu soup and the bulgogi. The meat was good quality where it wasn't chewy or stringy. The soup lacked a bit of flavor, but it was decent nonetheless. I had ordered spicy and it was the right level for me. The side dishes included fish cakes, kimchee, fermented radish strips, pickled squash, and pickled kimchee cucumbers. The bulgogi had a sweet sauce on it. I was surprised because I am more used to savory sauces on the bulgogi. The amount of food looked a bit small for the price, based on other Korean restaurants that I have been to. I think if I go back I'll try something else like the spicy rice cake or the yakisoba.",

The chicken pictures I saw pulled my attention so I decided to order more than my stomach could handle. We have 2 Bibimbap (bulgogi as I wanted my own), and order of dumplings and yeah, 2 different orders of chicken... The sweet & spicey along with the Garlic Fried chicken... I had no clue they were half chickens so when they showed up to the table, I could only think \"to go box please\"...   Food was good and it really opened me up more and more to Korean foods. The sides were good and even though I'm not a big kimchi fan, I enjoyed. When I come with friends, we will have to do a table as the booths are a bit snug to my liking. Good food!",

They were closing soon, so we knew we had to order and eat fast. They served us banchan prior our entrees.  - Kimchee fried rice: The portions were huge and I wish the egg was cooked so that it was slightly runny, but it was a bit dry instead. We were able to take the fried rice home, because it was such a huge portion that we weren't able to finish. Decent, but not the best I've had. - Slow Cooked Bulgogi Stew: This dish came out a lot larger than we thought too. My boyfriend had two large beef bones in his stew with his glass noodles and veggies. I thought this dish was very bland, which gives us little faith in the rest of the food here. The portion was generous though.   Overall, we felt rushed since the place was empty and close to closing, but the food itself wasn't as memorable as we wished. The service was decent. If we were to return, we would try the fried chicken or hot stone dishes as they seem to be the better dishes according to other Yelpers.",

I'm half Korean so maybe my opinion may be a little harsh but I did not feel the side dishes were up to par with a lot of the other Korean restaurants in the area. Tofu soup is my favorite and this one here was a little too thick for my liking. My friend did order the bulgogi and she enjoyed her meal.",

We ordered the spicy pork belly, mackerel, and seafood soft tofu soup. The spicy pork marinade tasted store-bought (there was a strange preservative-like aftertaste), the soup was basically just hot pepper flakes and pepper paste in hot water, and the mackerel was over fried, dry, and lacked any flavor whatsoever aside from grease. It was a complete waste of money going here and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone ever.",

We arrived around 6:00 pm and there were 3 tables. It smelled really good with grilled meat coming from the kitchen and that was a good sign!  We were seated right away! They went out of Hite beer so I tried the Cass. Very light.  Next we ordered and waited. The place started filling up and by the time we got our food we didn't see our waiter again. Looked like they were under staffed and with 2 people taking care of 15 + tables you are not going to get much service.  I wanted the refill of my banchan so we had to wave at them several times and finally after we almost finished the food the banchan came.   The seafood pancake was the highlight of the evening very crispy but the bulgogi and soon tofu soup combo was just ok.  My problem was there was some bugs flying around. I had to guard my food. And they serve my soup in a serious crack bowl! Please please replace your broken stone wear is ugly and I don't want to eat foreign objects.",

The gentleman that sat us oferred to take drink orders,  we both ordered waters. Me being antsy and hungry, I placed an order for the pork dumplings off of the appetizers menu to start. He returned soon after with the waters and the dumplings weren't far behind.     A waitress handled the rest of our stay at Gogi and took our order for our main courses. I ordered the lunch special Hot Stone bibimbap with beef bulgogi added(she mentioned it was an upcharge.. I appreciate knowing that ahead of time) which comes with the soon tofu soup. I ordered the kimchi tofu soup, she made sure to let me know that it was going to be sour and spicy.. I didn't know much of what to expect but I was willing to try it.  My friend ordered the spicy pork bulgogi with the mushroom tofu soup.     None of the food took very long to come out to us, all of which was hot and cooked to perfection. We spent most of the meal picking off each others plates, unable to decide which meal we liked more. I wasn't crazy over the Kimchi soup but I believe that was more of an unfamiliarity with the flavor then it being cooked incorrectly.     All of the staff was attentive, quick to help, checked up on us several times, and made us feel very welcomed. I am happy to see that the incredible ratings gogi currently has are for a reason.     We are already planning our next trip there. Thank you Gogi!",

I really thought my days of associating with Koreans were over since I left San Diego for the valley, and that I would have to travel back to Cali to find decent Korean food.  I've already written of my struggles to find chaminsul soju in AZ, so I was glad to see Jinro on their shelf. I can't speak to service as I got an order to go, but the waiter who helped me was friendly which is more than you normally get in Ktown LA, so that's a plus.  The kalbi and spicy pork belly were both as good as what I have gotten in Socal, so I was extremely pleased. Their banchan was good as well.  Maybe one of these days I'll get people to join me for a soju party, but until then, the to go order I had will have to satisfy my needs till then.  Kam samida yo!",

There are not many authentic Korean cuisines in the East Valley; but I have visited some within my residence, and I would say this place does not stand out from the rest. My lunch selections are Bulbogi, beef fried rice, and beef tofu soup (Lunch options). Zucchini and fish cake side plates taste awesome, and the other 3 are pretty acceptable. The Bulgogi is great and the thinned texture of meat absorbs the spices , but beef fried rice is very greasy with dried cubed beef, which makes it hard to chew. The tofu in the soup is starting to turn sour, and the rice from the combo is also dry and not so good.   Being short of staff really makes the dining experience a challenge. Despite the waiter keeps apologizing for the delay (and I totally understand), there's nothing in this place can keep me to come back.",

I'm pretty sure the bowls were about 10 inches in diameter, so definitely huge portions. More importantly, it was delicious (hubby allowed me a bite) and I loved how the rice got a little crispy from the heat of the bowl. I went with the spicy squid and pork belly and was in heaven!!  They also brought out a bunch of sides which came with the meal - fish cake, radish, potato, kimchi...awesome variety!!  We went on a Friday night right around 5 and were only one of a couple small groups within the restaurant. By 5:30, the place was packed, so I recommend going early. Next time, hot pot is on my list to try!!",

Let's try it cause we're running out of time It's oh so delicious.....! Bo Bites reviews they seem from the start It's all so lyrical......! When food is ready from the start  It's driving me out of my mind! That's why it's not hard for me to try Can't get it out of my mouth Miss it, taste it, love it That place is GOGI......!  Solid! Solid as a rock!    GOGI delivers to me in my book...and palate!  Located in the heart of what I call the Phoenix Asian mecca, GOGI's location is perfect to showcase to the Asian community.  GOGI's is modern and subtle like a model home display.  Not my cup of tea I guess.  Service was spot on though and very attentive and helpful when my buddy and I needed some suggestions.    We started with the Seafood Pancakes, which came with a ponzu-like sauce in a bowl full of jalapeno peppers.  Overall a nice start, the pancakes were nice and soft in the middle and crunchy at the edges with small cuts of calamari giving it some extra texture.  For our entree with shot for the Spicy Pork Belly and the Bulgogi Beef Hot Stone Bowl.  Boy did we hit the jackpot!  The Spicy Pork Belly was somewhat fatty, but overall the taste was music to my palates.  Tender with a hint of chewiness, the flavors was sweet and spicy; I could eat this all day with some rice!  Our Bulgogi beef hot bowl came with of course Bulgogi beef, bean sprouts, slivered carrots, spinach, cucumbers, and crusty rice....yeahhhh!  I love it when the rice at the bottom of the bowl  hardens giving this entree a crunchy punch.  They give you a sweet red sauce to liven up the dish since you can definitely smell and taste the strong sesame sauce oil they use to cook it.    Overall my kind of place to come to!  Seems like a family owned spot with some care and love to the craft.  In the end, it's an A in my books! - Enjoy!",

I didn't mind waiting since the service I got was decent and the waiter did come up to me to apologize for the wait and kept updates on the food. He also offered more side dishes for me to try while waiting so I didn't mind since they were basically free appetizers to me. They have quite a selection for both lunch and dinner on the menu. Lunch prices are MUCH cheaper than dinner, but I'm unsure about the portion size for lunch as I only went for dinner time. They also have sushi on the menu.   One problem for me was the design of this place. I don't understand it. It's a little bit weirdly designed and off vibe for me. I don't feel cozy or comfortable sitting in the restaurant. It's just an off interior design for me. Another problem is that they don't have pictures on the menu to show the food. I like pictures on my menu so I know what I'm ordering, especially when I'm with someone who isn't use to eating cultured food. Other than that, the food is pretty bomb.",

Parking is limited in front of the restaurant, but you can always park closer to the supermarket and walk over.   Service: I love the staffs! They are always friendly and attentive every single time I am here. Occasionally, the owners behind the kitchen will waive at us on our way out.   Food: they have this combo that allows you to order a decent size dish (ex: Korean BBQ or Ribs) that comes with a Tofu soup of your choice. That is what I normally order here. If you know Kim Chi, theirs are always fresh and generous when you need refill. I also love their spicy fish red noodles.   Rating: I am a regular here and this is one of my favorite Korean restaurants in AZ.",

At which point I just asked to cancel it so we could pay and go.

What I like most is that they have entree+tofu soup combo! And you can choose whatever tofu soup they have! For an Asian, it starts to feel like meal when there's a main dish, some small cold dishes and a soup! Many other places don't have these options. If you want both then get both with full price. But here a small sized soup really makes a difference.   Even though it's a smaller size soup, the materials were solid. It doesn't feel like a cheap add-on side, but really a smaller version of the real thing. I had seafood tofu soup with egg, mussel, clams and a real size shrimp, not like some other Korean restaurant nowadays that use small shrimpies and substitute mussel with small clams even in a full price soup. The flavors are pretty good. I can't say it's the best or it's outstanding, but the attitude here is better than many.   I will come back and would recommend it to my friends.",

Just when I thought my meal couldn't get any better I heard our server say these magic words \"Here is our steamed egg on the house\".

When we decide to go to GOGI, we know we're going to have a really fun night. Best Asian in Chandler, hands down!  It's a great date place, as well as what appears to be a very fun birthday or special occasion/large party event. We've sat near several long tables of special occasion groups, and they seem to be having a fantastic time.  The decor is minimalist and elegant. It reminds me of restaurants in New York.

Their stone pot bibimbap is really hot - makes that crusty rice on the bottom like it's supposed to. Be ready to flag folks down when you need something - just be cool about it... and you'll get what you need.",

It came out sizzling hot, and I broke the egg yoke and mix everything together with sauce. Tasted fantastic and it seemed very authentic. They also serve sushi but I didn't try any of that. My friends try the other dishes including the pork belly and the other bulgogi plates and some tofu soup. They didn't complain about it and it seemed they enjoyed it a lot.  The staff was friendly and was very attentive. I like how they were really familiar with their dishes and that they were constantly coming by to check if it tasted good or not. In the background they played some Korean pop music which was pleasing.  So now I have 4 Korean places that I will eat at. :-)",

Just like any other Korean restaurant, our meal came with side dishes. Serving size was good and flavor was on point also! Everything was really yummy! I just wish it was hotter, our platter wasn't sizzling.. but it could be an off day or maybe that's just how it comes.. I highly recommend the spicy pork! Service was average. Came by to take out order, brought out the food, and then the check. Other Korean places, constantly refill side dishes without asking.. this place never checked up on us besides giving us the check..",

Opportunity came yesterday on unusually cool morning for Phoenix in May, I was hungry for hot soft tofu soup.   When we walked in around noon, this place was busy! Only a few open tables left. As I walked by several tables I smelled yummy bibimbap sauce. I thought I wanted to eat soup but I also wanted to eat bibimbap. Before the server brought us menu, I told my friend I will order soup and you order bibimbap and let's share... Well when the menu came, my concern wasn't an issue anymore. They have combination lunch for soup and bibimbap! There must be others like me want to eat as much as I do!   Seafood soft soup bowl and hot stone bibimbap, of course it comes with several side dishes, there were lot of food. I finished everything served. Side dishes were good too. Their kimuchi was very spicy the way I like it.   I tasted my friend's spicy pork bulgogi and enjoyed nice flavor.  I saw several other dishes I wanted to try. Since my lunch was very solid authentic Korean food, I will be back to try several others in the menu.  I just need to learn to fight with food coma after eating here.",

It's ok, we're understood and tried to rush to get out , by 10:05 p.m they rushed us, keep came back to check our food and then gave us a bill, they keep coming back to ask and told us YOU WANT TO PAY that we're ready to close our cashier (but keep say NO RUSH) , never happened to us in a restaurant before, ask us to pay while we still have food on the table , 1st time EVER in my Life!

Thank you, Hon Machi, for being closed, because this gave us the opportunity to try this phenomenal new restaurant now on our rotation.    Are you looking for sushi?  Gogi's got it fresh and tasty, and they'll serve you a lot! (See picture)  Teryaki?  YES, with BIG hunks of meat.  I have had Chicken Teriyaki in a lot of places, and this place seriously surprised me with how much juicy, fresh chicken they put on my plate.  Like fried calamari?  This isn't the Italian type!  No rings or small tentacle bunches--you get strips and large, whole crispy tentacles.  Not as tender as the ones I'm used to, but very delicious!  While the place is primarily Korean, there's a good deal of Japanese and even Chinese dishes here as well.  There's enough choices to make anybody happy, so go here and bring your friends or family--or both.  When a lot of the other sushi houses are closed in the afternoon until 5pm, they are open.  Don't wait or hesitate--GO to GOGI.",

I thought that there wasn't a place in the valley like it, and I was so wrong!  We walked in later in the evening on a Friday, and were immediately seated. Our server was so warm and attentive (actually everyone in this restaurant is amazingly sweet).  This is a cute and affordable date place. Literally, we ordered two meals and an appetizer and had leftovers for two days. I really think you could get away with one entree and be fine. I had a chicken hot stone bowl and it was so good! I love the crispy rice underneath and how colorful it all was. We also got a seafood pancake and I've been day dreaming about it. It comes with this sweet jalapeno soy dipping sauce, and you see huge chunks of octopus and lots of scallions.   I did not order any sushi or dessert, but I will be back in the near future.",

    "text": "BEWARE! AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE A PLAGUE!!!! This is my new review of this place. I have this place in my list of decent Korean food restaurants, but my most recent experience was a nightmare.  Yesterday afternoon, at 3:30, I called in for a takeout order. I asked for two orders of pork rib soup. The person who took my order said they will be ready in 30 minutes and I told them I will be there within the next hour. After one hour and ten minutes, at 4:40, I was there only to hear my orders are not ready yet. They told me to wait for 15 more minites so I did. While I was waiting, I paid for my food but no one offered me a water or anything. After ten minutes of waiting, a guy comes out and says they would refund my money because they can't work on my orders right now. I was given two extra dollars for calling one hour ahead and waiting for an hour and thirty minutes and going home with nothing. My friend who ordered the same food with me was so upset she had to call them to ask what happened. The person who picked up the phone says their refrigerator broke down the day before and all their meat and raw items have gone bad so they couldnt make my orders(?????!!!???!?!?WTH??!). My friend said if they had known they wouldnt be able to complete our orders they should have informed us when we called. My friend couldn't be more upset because of the waitress's attitude. She was giggling the whole time (im guessing because she was talking to someone else?) and when my friend asked her what is so funny in this situation she said \"so what do you want me to do about it? (WORD FOR WORD)\" Needless to say, we didn't have anything to eat and we are NEVER coming back to this place. They could have given us a list of what they could make at the time without pork or something but they didn't. Not only have they lost my business, I am never going to make a recommendation when it comes to this place.",

This might be the best Korean restaurant in the Valley.  As with every Korean place anywhere you try ti find what's best on the menu and stick with it.  That's what my wife and I have done and our conclusions are:  No place else serves gamja tang in the Valley far as I know.  It is pretty good here.  It is big, and filling, with enough meat.  They raised the prices a bit, but it is still one of the better values for Korean food there is.  The dogani tang is also a good value.  They have put in A LOT of dogani every time I've ordered it.  The haemul pajun is solid here.  It is huge and I think they put in the most seafood of all the haemul pajuns around.   Finally, the dolsot bibim bap is also pretty good here.  I believe you get the best value here for your money of all the Korean places in the Valley.  Again, no place gets barbecued meat right in the Valley either, so when it comes to taste, I give it a meh.  BUT, they do give you a lot.",

Located in the Lee Lee shopping center that hosts several other restaurants, this intersection has become the best Asian food destination in all of Arizona. Although there are not many Japanese restaurants, I nevertheless wish I lived closer! I ordered the spicy squid and pork belly from their lunch menu. It was absolutely the best. The platter held a generous portion and was beautifully plated. The squid was cooked perfectly: not too chewy but still had a nice bite. Delightfully paired with the squid, the seasoned, leaner cuts of pork belly tasted heavenly. My taste buds were dancing from my meal with all the different flavors of the banchan infusing with my entree. The dining room was packed and lively with televisions showing fun K-Pop music videos. It was a great dining experience, and I will be coming back each time I visit Phoenix.",

I order the chicken Bulgogi lunch special and was very impressed with the amount of food that was served. The waitress brought out a variety of sides: potatoes, kimchi, zucchini, cucumbers, and tofu. All we're delicious! I will warn you that if you are super sensitive to spicy, the side dishes may be a little hard to eat. I cannot handle a lot of spice and still able to enjoy it with water close to me. The Chicken Bulgogi is a tad sweet which counter balanced the spicy sides well. One of my favorite aspects was that the rice was served on the side, which allowed me to skip the carbs.",

Several of our party made the mistake of ordering appetizers. Having eaten there before, I knew the size of the portions and did not order one. All of the appetizers were tasted but were taken home.  Next we ordered main courses. While others chose to order familiar dishes, I had the Bibimbap. In due course, I was brought a very large stone bowl that radiated heat like a burner. I have eaten this dish in many places and this was the best. The rice on the bottom was appropriately crisp, and the flavors were excellent.   Our only problem was slow service. Probably due to the large crowd, however, since we were seated next to the serving counter we helped ourselves to whatever we needed.  Bathrooms were appropriately clean and stocked and the floors and tables in the restaurant we're clean.   With the exception of the slow service I give them 4 stars for excellent food, large portion size, and general cleanliness.",

I was really craving some nice cold nengmyun and my friend and I decided to come give this place a try. The restaurant was not very busy and we were seated right away. When we tried to order the nengmyun the server said they ran out. We were supper bummed and we're getting ready to leave. My friend and I were trying to find other Korean restaurants that had it but most of them are closed on a Tuesday so we really didn't have much options to pick from. Thankfully our server came back and said they just made some broth so we were able to get it. Our food came out fairly fast and the side dishes were good. My favorite was the steamed egg they brought out! Everything about our dish looked yummy! The broth was really flavorful , the noodles were soft and I liked that they gave us more then one piece of meat. I don't understand why restaurants do that for some of their dishes.  Anyways it definitely satisfied my cravings and it was the perfect way to beat the heat. This time my experience was way better then the one I had a couple of years ago and I will be back!",

The inside decor is not bad and the tv screens that play korean music videos is a nice touch from the usual blank walls.  The servers here are always nice and very accommodating. Never have I had a bad service and I've at one point gone to this place three times in one week. They do have newer servers now since they've opened but the quality has not changed.   Food is great. The best prices for lunch can be found here. I would recommend the galbi and the seafood pancake. Get the pancake extra crispuI have tried their kimchi pancake but I'm not much of a kimchi fan. Not to say it's not good it's just not my preference. The tofu soups are all great so whatever flavor you may want you won't get disappointed. The bibimbap is amazing because of the amount and the flavor. It comes out hot and continually stays hot due to the stone bowl it is in. Don't let your rice sit for too long and continue mixing as you eat or your rice will get hard and will stuck to the bottom.  Sushi here was also a great find. Pieces are huge and the prices are fair. If you like a nice cheap chirashi bowl they have two versions korean and traditional Japanese. Their Johnny rocket roll has a nice flavor but I would recommend the King Kong roll. True to it's name the pieces are huge.",

They did their drawer calculations and claimed that I only gave them one twenty dollar bill. I am a server and I handle cash all day. The server told me he had only been serving for a month so it makes sense as to why he could have mishandled the money but the owners seemed to be the one handling all of the transactions and they still calculated that I only gave them $20. I felt bad and still left 5 bucks for a tip. Pay with card so they don't accuse you of ripping them off with cash!  I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.",

We ended up being a party of 8 (if I recall correctly) and the servers always came to check on us and refilled our drinks constantly. Very good service.   Can't remember everything we ordered (I didn't order or pay) but I remember the Chop Chae being one of the most TASTIEST foods I've EVER EATEN, and trust me, I have the best home cooked meals from my mother and I go to authentic places VERY often. The other meal that came just as close was the teriyaki salmon. OMGGGGG so savory and delicious (however either the most expensive dish or the top ones).   I went again next time and ordered only Chop Chae to eat with my mother. It filled us both and we still had leftovers (around $18).   For new comers, you can refill the side dishes!  Great service (young staff) and great food. Will always come back!",

Classy metal chopsticks are hard to get a grip on, especially if you're hungry, but the staff was very attentive... i asked for a fork and the damage was DONE! Haha.

We ordered the lunch Bulgogi and some beef ramen soup thing (I can't remember the actual name). The lunch portion of the Bulgogi had good flavor, but the portion was way smaller than I expected. The real issue was the beef ramen noodle soup thing. It smelled rotten and tasted like something in it was old. The best description of smell I could give when the waitress asked why I wasn't eating it or wanting to take it home was \"it smells old. Sort of like a dirty sock soaked in water\".   Food: 2 out of 10 (awful) Price: 8 out of 10 (good pricing) Service: 5 out of 10 (meh)  My reason for the iffy service rating is because our waitress kept pestering us to order even though we made it clear we needed some time to decide. Besides that, she was nice and brought us everything quickly.",

    "text": "I think the place is an okay place to come and have a meal whenever you're craving Korean food. The food isn't terrible, but it's not great either. The side dishes were sub par - the typical kimchi, fried fish cake, marinated potatoes, zucchini, and bean sprouts. I picked at each of them a little, but I didn't want to go any further than that.  I had the osam bulgogi (spicy squid and pork belly). It came in a huge round plate with some sad looking salad on the side. It wasn't bad. Some other people in my party ordered the regular bulgogi, which came in a smaller, more manageable portion, and it looked more appetizing as well. One person ordered the fried rice - it was so strange because it came in a huge dish, all rounded out with a fried egg on top.  The decor and color scheme were strange. A row of irrelevant paintings on one wall and the colors black and brown everywhere. The place didn't exude a Korean feel to it at all.   My overall feeling was that I just wasn't impressed with the food and confused by the decor.",

Would be nice if you were able to increase or decrease the spice level for varying tastes. I felt like something small was missing, though I can't quite put my finger on it (maybe more anchovy)?  Still tasty, however.  We also had the bulgogi and pork bulgogi, both of which were excellent.  Like other Yelpers have mentioned, the banchan (sides) were also great!  The service here is wonderful.  Very attentive and quick to refill your drinks and side dishes.  Price is reasonable.  As expected, the lunch prices are slightly lower than dinner.  Would go back!",

    "text": "*Edited 12/15/2014*  -New review-  Went back for some gogi, yup. +1 star. :D  -Old review-  Any new Korean restaurant in the valley is welcome and always a good sign of the growing community!  My g/f and I got there a little later than our usual dinner time, but was glad that they were open until 10pm (which is always good). I've noticed a trend that the Korean restaurants in the west valley are generally open until 11pm or even later, while the east valley restaurants close no later than 10pm.   The first thing I noticed was the classy decor of the restaurant, but was a little perplexed of the \"no-grill in the table\". Perhaps they bring out a mini-burner like Hodori? With the restaurant named \"meat\" I would assume that is their specialty, but I will save that for another visit as I did not see any people with the burner - please keep in mind it was 9pm so I wasn't expecting the restaurant to be packed.  Anyways, I ordered the mae-un-tang (spicy fish stew) and my g/f ordered the kimchi tofu soup. The side dishes came out very quickly and we were served kimchi, radish kimchi, pickled radish slices, bean sprouts, spinach, and fish cake stir fry. The radish kimchi was a little bland for my liking but the rest were pretty good.  The tofu soup was the first dish to make it out - while it had decent flavor, it didn't really compare to some of the tofu-specialty restaurants in the valley - but that's okay, we really didn't expect \"blow my mind\" tofu soup since the restaurant's name was Gogi (meat). My spicy fish stew came out not long afterwards and was served in a traditional shallow and wide pot. Glad I ordered that - it was pretty delicious. The whitefish was nice and soft and had all of the fixings that it should have had.  Service was pretty good overall~ I'd definitely like to come back and try the meat dishes!",

    "text": "I will preface this review by saying their food was delicious but the way they do business is very shady and quite frankly unethical. This place does not do itemized receipts, which is understandable as I know many other restaurants do this as well but they still do not indicate tax and gratuity. As a matter of fact they include gratuity at 18% automatically into the bill which is understandable as well. What upset me though was upon receiving my bill it seemed quite inflated EVEN when accounting for the 18% tip and tax. Then through further investigation I found that I was charged 10% more on the original cost of the food without any seemingly explanation. I indicted the correct amount on the signed merchant receipt but when I got home they still charged me the original amount different than what I had written down which I am pretty sure is illegal. Safe to say I will not be eating from this lying, cheating institution ever again.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times. The food is excellent! If you want good Korean food this is the place to go. The main reason for 4 stars, is that the service is a bit lacking, they are understaffed. When I go, they are usually fairly busy and it's hard for the wait staff to keep up, but if you don't mind waiting a bit longer for waters, sides, etc then it's not a big deal. I always still tip on the high side because I feel bad for the wait staff. It's not really their fault management under staffs the place.  In terms of the food, I've gotten their hot-stone rice bowls, soon tofu soups, as well as their main entrees. Those are the three main categories I would say they have on their menu. They also do offer fried rice, which I have not had and can't comment on.  The hot-stone rice bowls are always excellent, it's a large amount of food and if you get it with the soon tofu combo you will have enough food to take home! It's a generous portion and the soup is always excellent. I highly recommend this combo for any first timers to get a taste of authentic Korean. It will run between $13-18 dollars for this combo depending on what you get and if it's lunch/dinner.  The entrees in my opinion are on the more expensive side. While it's a good amount of meat (and it's mostly meat) I don't feel it is $16 worth of meat. Other than the price, it is very good and is the go to place for my Korean friends and I. A single entree will feed about one or two people depending on how hungry you are. Also, the mini-side dishes always help and the unlimited refills on those make this place awesome. I highly recommend this place and go here quire regularly myself.",

    "text": "The first few times I tried this restaurant..I thought it was decent. This time..I really feel like the restaurant has gone south. For authentic Korean food..I feel like chodang and hodori is better, more cleaner. Chodang has the best tofu soup. Hodori, the best meat. Chodang is the \"cleanest\". Here at gogi, the tofu soup is mediocre at best. The kimchi is sickly sweet. The fried rice is the greasiest I've ever tasted. The tempura came out overfried. The bulgogi was fine. The dolsotbibimbop is oily as well. The seafood pancake is a good deal for $10. The raw fish and rice is ok..mostly salmon and too much salad. Overall, if you are non Korean..you may be satisfied with this food. But definitely ..I would not take any Koreans here to eat. The food quality is terrible. The service however is very good (thus the third star).",

I was craving authentic korean food, best korean restaurant in arizona. if you visit the restaurant, look around the kitchen area. the owner are cooking every meal. don't forget to ask egg soup (Gaeran Jim) which comes with every meal. the meals are twice the size of east coast portion. highly recommended.",

    "text": "The food here is amazing, but the service is absolutely terrible. I've been here 3 times and every time I hope that the service will be better but it never is. Takes about 10 minutes just to order drinks and another 10 to order food unless you flag down your waiter. My friend and I both ordered the same thing and her food came out 15 min ahead of mine. My sister ordered a deep fried sushi roll and when it came out she noticed it wasn't fried at all. When she asked the waiter he stated that they changed how they cooked the roll but haven't updated the menu. We finished eating and sat for an extra 30 just waiting for the bill. Currently I'm still waiting for our bill. The couple next to us has been seating for at least 20 min and nobody has been by to ask them what they want to drink. HIRE MORE PEOPLE.",

    "text": "Avoid this place. Food is not even good and the service is outrageously insulting. Spend your valuable time and money elsewhere like  Hodori in Mesa or Cho Dang at Chandler. I would have given zero star if there was an option.   I've been to Gogi probably 5 times total. Only reason is because of close proximity from my workplace.   5 out of 5 times, I've experienced very bad service by their incompetent waiters/waitresses.   They hardly understand English, not attentive, have to reminded many many times, entree/rice/banchan/water does not come out in proper order or seriously late.  I can't understand how the owners cannot see this terrible food services their employees provide.   In all my visits, there were issues with extreme wait time for your food (even when they are not busy!!). Average wait time is well over 30 minutes or more.   Last straw that broke the camel's back was last Friday when I took my coworker for lunch. I ordered two kalbi-tang (beef rib soup) and side order of gyoza. The older waitress who took our order did not speak or understood English well. She didn't repeat the order she took. Just took down our order in hurry and was running like a chicken without a head.   We wait 40 minutes (thought I time them since this wait time is common here). I ask for our order to few of other waitresses. Our waitress doesn't even bother to check ( still running around elsewhere like she is super busy when they don't even have much customers). Finally one soup comes out and not even a apology. We still wait for my soup, nothing. It's now 50 minutes past. Still nothing. We get our side dish gyoza. I ask again to another waitress about my soup, I guess she checks my order and talks to our waitress. I overhear \"they got all their order, I don't know what he is talking about\". Our waitress then comes over to our table and speaks in angry broken English, \"you order gyoza and you got it\". I tell her, \"no, I've ordered two soups and a side order of gyoza\". She then smirks and taps my shoulder and says \"oh so sorry, hahaha\". I tell her I am very upset and nothing to laugh about because this isn't the first time I had services issues with them. She say \"you want a soup?\"  I say \" I only have 10 minute left for my lunch time, how can you now bring it?\". She just walks off.   I am furious now but didn't want to ruin the lunch for my coworker. I chomped rest of my small gyoza meal and I ask for the check. Another waitress brings out bill and our waitress brings out the soup. I am like \"what the F!!!\" She gets angry after I tell her \"why did you bring the soup now. I can't eat it in 5 mins\". She just takes it back without any apology again.   I write my complaint note in my CC receipt and leave. I will never ever go to this establishment again. The owners are clueless in how to run a business properly in service terms.   Heed my warning. If you don't mind waiting 40 mins plus in average for your average Korean food and crappy service, then you are an exception from the norm.",
