Their fruit actually tastes like what the fruit is. Like its not sitting on the back all mixed together in some fruit cup or something. I have tried almost the whole menu and have never been disappointed.  Even our friends from out of town ask us to take them here again and again. I have been to a couple other locations and this one is by far my favorite. Just one thing...I have to praise the staff again. Everyone is so friendly and happy. EVERYRIME! They always remember us and ask how we're doing. You girls are awesome!!! Coffee is the best also! Enjoy!",

Now we're all happily stuffed and can't wait to come back soon!  Biscuits in biscuits and gravy were big and fluffy  Crepes were stuffed full of fresh fruit and the granola aide was delicious. It also came with a fresh muffin of the day. I got poppy seed and started feeding the cute birds around me with it til I realized it was too good to not eat myself! Bacon portions were great...4 large crispy pieces and the home fries were plentiful and fresh with a perfect amount of onion.  Side salad looked and tasted wonderful and the benedicts are fresh looking and wonderful and not too difficult to cut into their wonderful English muffins.  Sandwiches are a great size and delicious.   I'm going to be thinking about this breakfast all day!!",

My only complaint is and have said this in the past, is the size of the muffins. They are so good but really expensive for the size so I never order them anymore. Until they make them cheaper or more like the size of Mimi's Cafe muffins I'll pass. However this place will remain a staple as one of my go to breakfast/brunch places.

When I asked the server, she said no, just potatoes!  Clearly, the menus shows fresh fruit, even online!  I also ordered a special juice, which was $3.99, little pricey.  I know you do not get refills on the juice, but we always used to get refills on the iced tea.  So, I asked if I could get an iced tea to go since could not get a refill on the juice, another $2.99 added to the bill.  I did not expect to pay $20.00 for lunch today at a breakfast restaurant.  Used to go here all the time, lunch with refills on iced tea was $11.00.  I will not be going here any longer.  The prices and service are not what they used to be!  Very pricey for a breakfast/lunch restaurant!",

The key word being used to. It has been a while since there has been new management and I feel that ever since the new management came in the quality in the service has gone down. There are times you will walk in and its chaos. I understand that there may be the regulars that go there that know many employees but they do get the majority of the waiters attention. I have gone and waited about 10 min for someone to come around and ask me if I needed anything or even greet me and take my order. I also am a regular in the sense I have breakfast there every weekend. Yet, previously the gentleman that was manager did a fantastic job of seating individuals and checking on them. I believe I heard he left to corporate which is fantastic for him. Also, I have noticed there has been a turnover in the employees. I saw the same people but ever since new management the waiters are different and to be quiet honest its not for the better. There are maybe one or two waiters that are great and one of them is Elijah ask to get seated in his area because otherwise forget it you aren't given any attention. Honestly, the quality of the service needs to be worked on. I would agree this is a more upscale IHOP which is the reason I come here. The food is great but be warned of the quality of service.",

Their customer service came through with a gift card  for two to eat breakfast, brunch or lunch at their restaurant because of my previous review--I had a complimentary birthday breakfast, brunch or lunch, but the hostess only took $2.00 off  my total bill when my husband and I were leaving. I mentioned this in my first review and First Watch Customer Service sent me a message to send them my contact information so they could make it right for my birthday. They did make it right and I am very appreciative of them for that. They will always have my family and my repeat business. Our waitress was fantastic! She was great at checking in with us and making sure we had  coffee and our food was delicious. She was very friendly and personable.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Salmon and fresh tossed greens. My husband ordered the works omelette with fresh fruit and sourdough toast. We ordered coffee, some of the best in Phoenix and cold water. Fresh, hot, delicious entrees for brunch. This restaurant is one of our favorites to dine at. I highly recommend First Watch.",

It consists of Kale, Fuji Apple, Cucumber and Lemon. Absolutely delicious and refreshing for only $3.99, take that Whole Foods!

I'll keep going back though, the protein pancakes and coffee are on spot. I would also love to know I'm wrong.",

I have been going here for over a year, but I felt the need to write a review today because I went with a huge group of coworkers and we all wanted seperate checks. Whenever I had done that anywhere else you can feel the tension from your waitress and even if they keep a smile you know deep down that they hate you for making that simple request that already knew was coming. Our waitress on the other hand brought it up right away since it was pretty clear and made it no big deal.   She must have heard us complaining about going back to work because she offered to go cups without us needing to ask. She also noticed that one of my coworkers barely touched his food and didn't want it to go. She was concerned and asked him if there was something wrong with it. He had no complaints, his eye were just bigger than his stomach and the meal wouldn't make good leftovers, but he enjoyed what ate and was happy with it. She didn't press any further, but showed that she was observant and cared about our dining experience.  I wish I got a copy of my receipt so I could remember her name because she deserves recognition, but she is short, thin, with a brown pixie cut and glasses.",

I had had the salmon benedict.....taste was fine. My only problem with the dish was, it came out cold and even the bread underneath was cold and hard.        I think this is going to be one of my go to breakfast/brunch spots as it within a easy driving distance.  The quality of the food is two thumbs up!!!",

My kiddo and her dad love the bacon! Kid meals are all under $6 including a drink and come with generous sized portions. The servers are all excellent; very attentive and friendly. Also love the rustic, homey environment. Definitely my favorite breakfast place in the valley",

My dad and I came back on Monday instead and we're seated within ten minutes or so. I had their market breakfast skillet filled with house made potatoes and a variety of veggies with a bit of feta tossed in. I got a couple of perfectly poached eggs on top. My dad got the more traditional breakfast plate with two eggs, potatoes, and 4 enormous slices of applewood smoked bacon. Both plates can with their house made multigrain thick cut toast and jam. I also decided to try one of their pancakes. It was large, hot, and tasty! Then even provide warm maple syrup. My dad decided to also try one of their house made juices. His contained lemon, blueberry, white grape juice, and a touch of basil. He absolutely loved it. The best part: the price! For all that food we paid $20 a person. That's a deal! I highly recommend anyone visiting the Phoenix area come to First Watch; you won't be disappointed!  P.S. Even with how busy there were, the service was attentive, polite, and very welcome!",

Our server came back promptly with our drinks and was attentive throughout our meal. My boyfriend ordered the Elevated Egg Sandwich which was amazing. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were seasoned well. I ordered the seasonal Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash and the seasonal Rainbow Toast. The hash was flavorful and a good portion, but the corn was pretty much nonexistent in it. I enjoyed it but it definitely needed more of the corn that it was named after. The rainbow toast was a wonderful idea that was poorly executed. The brioche bread was slightly burned and the mango was small frozen pieces. Why have a seasonal special if you're not going to use fresh fruit that's in season? All in all this was a far better experience than the first, and we'll be back. My advice is to just stick to regular menu items and don't try the specials.",

My wife had the Turkey avocado benedict and she loved it,  along with a Cinnybun type pancake. I had the spinach avocado benedict and it was very tasty and fresh.  All the food was tasty and fresh!  Oh, I also had to try the lemon ricotta pancakes,  even though I could not finish them, they were a nice Italian twist and very refreshing.  I think we fpuns a new regular Sunday breakfast spot! Thanks First Watch for being on point!  UPDATE: We have been back three times now and enjoyed every time.  Thanks guys.",

I usually do a search on my phone for \"Diners Near Me\" or \"Breakfast Near Me\". Well on this trip I was staying in Phoenix and did my typical search and First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy came up. As we all do we look at reviews and the menu. I decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.  The minute you walk in you feel the great friendly atmosphere. You are fine being a party of one without having to sit at the counter, like its a holiday and you have to sit at the kids table. The decor pulls you right in, the aroma is next and the friendly staff really make you feel welcome.  So if you are staying at the Spring Hill Suites, The Towne Place suites or even the Sheraton, do yourself a favor and walk a 1/4 mile up Frontage side of Black Canyon and have a great breakfast at First Watch.  BTW, try the Millionaire's Bacon. Let's call it dessert after your breakfast. Order it and you'll know why.",

After being sat in a booth by the hostess I pulled out my computer to find the WiFi doesn't work. No big deal was really just hungry to begin with. After about 15 minutes of sitting, no one came over or acknowledged me,  I watched a table that came in after me get drinks, and multiple servers were standing at the hostess station at any point in time because the place wasn't busy. I politely gave my menu back to the hostess and left. Really unfortunate because I wanted to try the menu but not at the cost of feeling invisible.",

Tramonto  location needs to get their act together again....been very disappointed lately.

I visited today, Monday 4/16/18, around 9am. I had placed my order ahead of time and arrived about 25 mins after placing the order. Upon arrival, there were people waiting to be seated and other waiting to pay. Since its a small walkway, I stood to the side to let other be seated. Kelly walked up to the cash register and assisted the lady who wanted to pay for her meal that wasn't ready for pickup. After, she asked who was next as multiple people had formed around the register. After another customer stepped up and was cashed out, I walked up and stated I had a to go order. Kelly without hesitation, looked at me and stated my order wasn't ready. Note that she never checked on any orders behind her. I had noticed a bag behind her since the moment I walked in. After stating that, she told the gentleman standing behind me that should could cash him out. Once she was done with the gentleman, she turned around and made a statement about how the order had been sneaked past her. She provided me with the total and it wasn't until I asked for her name did Kelly's tone change. She asked how my day was. Kelly was not only unprofessional to myself but her peers as she barked orders around.   I've always visited the location on union hills and 83rd Ave and I'll either go there or elsewhere.",

My husband and I each chose the \"Trifector\" with eggs over easy and Belgian waffles. The eggs were unexpectedly special: perfectly cooked and seasoned and lightly topped with fines herbs. Perfect! The generous size waffles were the best we've had since the 1964 World's Fair! My bacon was good but his pork sausage was outstanding.  I should note that we greatly appreciated the layout.  No crowding and plenty of room between tables to accommodate my walker.  The place was very clean and the service excellent.  We are coming back on our next trek!",

I will leave this place still hungry. kinda disappointed.  not the place to come for breakfast if you are hungry and have a big appetite.  you can get more food at IHOP for the same price and taste the same.",

The specialty juice drinks are delicious  (we sampled all 3) and the menu is rife with delectable descriptions of the food that hardly do the food justice. From tomato basil soup and half sandwiches to pancakes and stone-cut oatmeal we were taken with First Watch and due to the phenomenal service I expect it to be our \"First\" choice every time we visit!",

Two things are outstanding to me. First are the scrambled eggs. Typically I avoid them in restaurants due to how awful they usually are. Not here. They are fantastic. The other thing is the fresh squeezed OJ. Why anyplace in AZ serves frozen concentrate is beyond me.   The prices are not cheap. they are not overboard either for what you get. The place also has a more upscale feel than typical chains or mom and pop places. Definitely a place you can take someone out to breakfast too and feel good about.",

The server recommended a freshly pressed juice to my husband, and he took her up on it.  It was amazeballs!  It had Orange, Ginger, Beet, Tumeric, and Lemon juices.  I don't drink a lot of sweet juices, but he pressed a sip on me, and holy moly, it was good.  I joked to him that all it needed was a shot of vodka, and you would have a master crafted cocktail.  The service was excellent, and we didn't want for anything.  I was quite happy with my omelette, although I found it a bit odd that it was served with salad greens, instead of potatoes.  My husband had huevos rancheros tostadas.   He was all about the clean plate club.   From what I gather, this is one of a small chain of breakfast and lunch restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back here.",

In Phoenix for a sons college soccer match, First Watch was just steps from our hotel. There were maybe 10 people ahead of us on a Saturday morning, but we were seated after a short wait. The food is prepared with locally grown and raised ingredients. The portions don't make you feel like you need a nap at 10:00am. But wow, soooooo good. Our waiter asked if we wanted his \"top 3 favorites\", we ordered two of them. I had the \"Trifecta\" 2 farm raised eggs (yes, there is a difference), amazing side of pork sausage ( you could select bacon or chicken sausage) and a light, fluffy Belgian Waffle made with a vanilla bean mix, served with a side on homemade jam. Holy smokes. My wife went with the blueberry pancakes, again, over the top good.  Add a friendly, efficient wait staff and this place is on another planet!",

Breakfast was essential after a long night and Yelp told me First Watch was the place to go. I am pleased to say Yelp was very very right.   I started out with coffee - they brought a whole carafe. Bonus points. No waiting for refills! We also ordered one of their house made juice concoctions (can't remember the name for the life of me) - the waittress brought us two for taking so long to deliver them (in reality it was less than 3-4 minutes?). I wasn't about to complain about free stuff!  On to breakfast.. I ordered the elevated breakfast sandwich. This was the right choice. If you eat here - have this one item if nothing else. I ordered a side of their special maple syrup covered / peppered bacon to go along with it. It was all fantastic. The sandwich really exceeded my eggspectations. :) Highly recommend.   Nitpicking: We waited a bit longer than we should've to be greeted at our table. This is the only thing I can complain about even looking for something, but I don't want to write a review that's all positive.. that's so unlike me!  Eat here, don't miss it if you're in phoenix!",

I ordered \"The Works\" which is an omelet with ham, bacon, sausage, crimini mushrooms, onions and tomatoes with cheddar and monterey jack. topped with sour cream, and chose a mixed green salad as a side. The omelet was good and was a moderate-size portion; it would still qualify as a light lunch. The mixed green salad was nothing special. The coffee was delicious and was refilled in a timely manner.

    "text": "My wife and I lucked our way here, based on 2 minutes of Yelp searching for a quick bite to eat on the drive from the Phoenix airport to Sedona. We couldn't have been happier that we found First Watch.  This First Watch was conveniently located off the highway for us, but inside was very unrushed, comfortable and homey but still cool and decorated with a rustic feel--very unlike how you'd imagine a highway-side location to feel. The food was packed with attractive healthy options, and we both truly enjoyed our meals--one 2-fer superfood kale salad and havarti and roast beef sandwich, and a power quinoa bowl with \"basted\" eggs (resembling an egg over easy, but cooked without oil or butter).  The service was extremely friendly, and the whole experience made us very appreciative of having had a chance to pass by. We'd definitely stop in again if we're headed the same way again, and would recommend it to friends!",

    "text": "I went in to get breakfast to go. The staff was very friendly. I asked how one of their specialty drinks was, and they let me sample it. I bought two elevated egg sandwiches and kids chocolate chip pancake. The elevated egg sandwich was very good. It had mayo, which normally I don't get on sandwiches because people don't know what \"go easy on the mayo\" means. However, it was delicious. The it has crispy bacon, egg, avocado & gruyere cheese on a brioche bun with arugula. The arugula added a slight peppery flavor, which was complemented by the creamy avocado, and bacon goodness. The bun was rich but not dense and was just lovely. I can't wait to eat it again. The potatoes really lacked flavor. They weren't salted, which is fine by me because I don't like tons of salt. But I did need to load them up with pepper, and dip them in ketchup & sriracha. They were with sauteed onions. They weren't as crunchy as I would have liked.  Melon cooler: very sweet, but the flavors are subtly complex behind the sweetness. It would be amazing with some vodka. I would definitely drink this again. It's made with honeydew, which not many drinks I've found are made with. If you like honeydew, you'll LOVE this drink. It was $3.99 when I went.   Kids chocolate chip pancake: It comes with either bacon or sausage and a drink.  It's very large, fluffy pancake. It's basically how you would want a good pancake to taste, the batter isn't overly sweet, but is just barely sweet. The chocolate was good quality and my daughter loved it. She loved the sausage the most.   The atmosphere was warm & friendly with very cute decor. My daughter wanted to sit down and eat there.   Overall, this place is very good. We will be back sometime, hopefully soon.",

That extra attention is very much appreciated.   The menu is a typical breakfast, brunch and lunch food.  Omelets, soups, creative salads and sandwiches.  Sage had the healthy turkey omellette and I ordered the omelette with avocado and hot tea. There's a lot of healthy options and portions are the perfect size.  Another thing is they have free WI-FI.

We first came here on a Sunday after church for brunch, this branch was packed with a wait time of 30-40 minutes. This branch is small and it was too hot to wait outside so we left.  We cane back on a wednesday and we thought it was the perfect time, not much people were there and we didn't have to wait to be seated.  My husband ordered the Ham & Gruyere omelet, and the Millionaire's bacon on the side (I am not a bacon lover butthat one I have to say was reaalllyy good).  I got Belgian Waffles (it was the best waffles I have tasted by far, and I am very hard to please when it comes to waffles so this was super good I guarantee!) and the Florentine Eggs Benedict (as recommended by our server). The Eggs Benedict tasted a bit bland and I'm not going to orde it again, but I'm giving them 4 stars because overall service, price and food quality is amazing!",

After we reviewed we were contacted via yelp message by a representative from customer service asking for our phone number to contact us about our review. We provided our phone contact and still have yet to receive a call. Seriously. 10 months go by and no call. I have yet to go back to that location. My husband went to a different location and said it was astronomically better! I would love to give this location another try as it is closer. Maybe they were just overwhelmed or having a bad month that month. I dont know. Maybe I'll never know.",

The waitress was not overly friendly, and didn't really joke around with us, which kind of sucks when you're in a diner-style place like that because that interaction really adds to the experience.

The \"Not Guilty Your Honor\" veggie wrap is good. It comes with a side of hummus, fruit and potatoes. Big meal! The \"Burrito Vera Cruz\" breakfast burrito was pretty good. The Vera Cruz sauce is a mixture of salsa and hollandaise. I've never had it before trying it here and it was actually pretty tasty! Mango iced tea is good! And they'll give you some to go if you ask!  Somethin about the potatoes just doesn't cut it for me though... And as I mentioned earlier, the breakfast just isn't my favorite. I just don't dig their omelets much.  Sign up for their email club to get a buy 1 get 1 free meal coupon.  Note: If you're vegan, order the veggie wrap and substitute avocado for the feta cheese. Get a side of salsa too.",

My favorite breakfast is their Tri-Athlete omelette; which I hesitatingly tried b/c it was a healthy choice but fell in love with it! Wonderfully roasted vegetables in an egg-white only omelette topped with salsa...muahhh, magnifico!!  For lunch I had their Pecan Dijon chicken salad...wow, another amazing dish full of flavors...good to the last drop!  And lastly, their customer service...always SPOT ON! Once we had only 15 minutes.

I started my meal with wanting to try a juice special from the seasonal menu. My server took the time to bring out little shot cups of the different flavors so I wouldn't spend money on a drink I didn't like. They were all delicious, but I decided to go with their Kale Tonic(Fuji Apple flavor mainly, lemon, kale, and cucumber to refresh your day).  After the most wonderful server gained my trust, I took her recommendations for the rest of my meal.  I followed up my Kale Tonic with First Watch's Million Dollar Bacon. Me and my three friends loved the flavor and could have all put down a BLT with this stuff.  My next course was the legendary: Rainbow Toast. If you're a berry lover, this is the best breakfast ever. Like a strawberry shortcake on steroids.  I finished up with the Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash. They really nailed the Tex Mex Breakfast and put a defining flavor to mornings in Phoenix. I would recommend this 4 course breakfast to anyone and would love to take someone on a morning date here.   Great menu, cool location, service on fleek. 10/10",

For a late Sunday brunch around 11 am, we waited for about 20 mins to get seated and once we got to our seats and ordered, our food came out quickly despite it being a busy time.   We got the Farmhouse Skillet Hash, Classic Eggs Benedict, Millionnaire's Bacon, the Veggie Burger, Tomato Basil Soup, and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. EVERYTHING we got was delicious. It might have to do with the fact that we were hungry, but seriously, we thought everything was great. I personally had the hash and I thought everything went well together. The millionnaire's bacon, while a bit pricy, was also waaay worth the price especially if you're trying it for the first time.  Parking is easy, and you can also reserve your spot in line on the Yelp app! Looooved my first time here and will definitely be back.",

I went for a lighter breakfast of avocado toast and eggs which was surprisingly filling. The bread was thick, the avocado topping they had was beautifully seasoned, and the eggs were done exactly like I asked. The water could have used water, I'm not gonna lie. But I'm also not going to knock any stars off for it bc I love you first watch. Keep doin you bb.",

Their pancakes are delicious but not as good as some places such as \"The Original House of Pancakes.\" Their pancakes are something different and come with a variety of fillings (blueberry, etc). The syrup jar is brought to your table warm, yes warm, so it flows easier and their is not sharp contrast with the temperature of the pancakes. They pancakes and toast come with a jam cup (like ones used for ketchup).The toast here is awesome and I highly recommend it. They have a dish call avocado toast that is quite filling with it but I enjoyed it most on the side with butter and jam. They have a bacon speciality you can get with standard breakfast orders or order it on the side. The eggs and potatoes are good but not great, although I have not had a full omelet. They have a juice bar so oj, grapefruit, apple, and other juices are offered at 3 to 5 dollars.  The location is surrounded by hotels whom I assume are their main customers. Parking looks bad but if you are staying at a hotel it isn't a bother.   Cons are that like most places that are good it gets busy and crowded.   The service is five star in friendliness and I must recommend Lee-ann (forgive the spelling she didn't have a name tag).  The ambiance is kid friendly with a but of rustic charm.   Price - as breakfast places go it is on par with the better and higher end with most stuff between $8 to $12 per person total.  Quality is also high end with their juices, pancakes, and bacon. Delicious.    This is a great place to stop if you are passing through Phoenix and want a high quality breakfast. I will eat here again if it is convenient.",

The office I work for has used this location for special breakfast meetings for departments and sub-departments, so I was familiar with their food and service. I like how they've redecorated their restaurant.   However, today, I mentioned to the waitress that I was having a \"bad\" day. She said similar and that her birthday was \"tomorrow.\" I quickly ate my meal so I could hit the road and, when I asked her for the bill, she told me she paid for it! I was so surprised. I've heard of people paying it forward, but I've never had anyone pay my bill! Isn't that nice???   Thank you, Jontay! HAPPY BIRTHDAY, too!",

My husband's waffle was delicious and crispy outside while fluffy inside.  I got the Key West Crepegg (omelet / crepe) with turkey, bacon, avocado, tomato etc.  It was ok except the turkey tasted a little old and there was the tiniest scoop of diced tomatoes and a tiny dollop of sour cream which was frustrating and the english muffin that was supposed to come with it was absent.  The coffee and the orange juice was really good and you could tell they have a nice group of regulars, like a family.  It looks closed from the freeway but the entrance on the opposite side is inviting and warm.  Just a few changes and this place could be spectacular.  I think i would like to try the lunch offerings and I will probably go back just to see how it is the next time.",

If you are familiar with the Hobees restaurants in the SF Bay Area, this is probably as close as you will find to Hobees, but with a better menu selection.  They do indeed give you a whole pot o coffee, which they even refilled for us. Although it was bustling, we did not feel rushed and were able to linger over a 3rd cup. My BF loved their coffee, but I found it a bit weak for my taste. Would love if they offerred a darker roast. But all-in-all it is a great value. We will be back!

    "text": "I first want to start out by saying I love First Watch. I was always reluctant to try it but after the first time I met my soon to be mom in law there for lunch I was hooked. Before I seriously started watching my weight I would usually get the ham and cheese to the fifth degree and the tomato soup combo. *HOLY CHEESY FOODGASM IN MY MOUTH* it is to die for. Although it isn't printed on the menu anymore you can still ask for it and they will make it. Now when we go I order the Power Wrap (which is on the lighter side menu) I never knew egg whites, spinach, turkey, and Swiss cheese topped with salsa could be so damn good. Their mango iced tea is awesome as well. As for the establishment it's self it is always clean. The staff is typically pretty friendly and accommodating. I almost want to give them 5 stars but I do believe some improvements could be made to better some of their menu items. So I'll give it 4 stars... Yay! I'm a fan.",

    "text": "I have been to three locations of this establishment and have been prettty pleased with my visits. I always opt for  breakfast here... The Acapulco express omelette is excellent..chorizo, avocado, green chilies and onions, melted cheeses, sour cream and their fresh made salsa.  I also love their french toast, which along with pancakes and waffles are made from scratch. The Floridian french toast used to be Arizona french toast and had the most delectible prickly pear butter with it, but it's newer incarnation is covered in berries and kiwi and is tasty nonetheless. I have never had bad service here. I've mostly received 25% tip worthy attentiveness.  I like how there seems to be delightful little bowls of fruit on the side with most entrees. (And not just crappy melons and grapes) Also, the coffee isn't bad and they have the courtesy to leave a fresh caraffe full so I am never caffeine deprived when leaving. All in all its a solid joint for breakfast in my humble opinion.",

Service is fine, the portions are fresh, and the servings quite generous.       The atmosphere is American Diner, but unless you're trying to impress a business associate this should not be an issue - you can always go over to the Biltmore, spend twice as much, and eat the same food in smaller quantities.       I-17 on/off is easy, parking is more than adequate, and the neighborhood is all office buildings and motels.       Bottom line: First Watch is a safe choice for breakfast/brunch.",

It takes  15-20 minutes to be seated. they will seat people who come in behind you that are the same party size. The ladies in the front have bad attitudes and act like they don't want to be there. Once you're seated it takes at least ten minutes for your order to be taken and 20 minutes to get your food. On a scale of 1 to 10 the food is a solid 4. You get better food at ihop.

    "text": "We went here for family Sunday Brunch with the parents. The parking lot was full and we thought we were going to have to wait to be seated. So we sent Dad to forge ahead as we parked the car. We cruised on in, and low and behold my Dad was at a table directing us to our table. I was shocked that we got seated right away, but the restaurant is big inside. So if the parking lot looks crowded, still check it out, you might be surprised. So we got all settled in and browsed the menu. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted. It was great! As a semi-vegetarian, there were tons of choices. There was also a healthy food section that I was drawn to.  My mom and I both decided to order the same thing- the tri athlete omelet. My dad got the Acapulca express omelet and husband got the bacado. We were all set to order but waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our table, even to get our drinks. That was a little irritating, but it was busy so we went with it. Finally the waitress arrived and we ordered. She apologized for the wait.  We waited a little longer than normal for food to arrive but when we did, we were happy. The food was really good. I loved my healthy omelet. I thought I would miss the cheese, but when I covered it in salsa I was like \"cheese who?\" I devoured it and it was delicious. I even put it on the english muffin and had a nice breakfast sandwich. Everyone else cleaned their plates too.   would we go back? Yes we would. It was tasty and there are still many more things I want to try and I wouldnt feel too guilty about.  So check it out and dine happy!",

They only have country potatoes which I prefer hash browns but not a deal breaker for me.  My alternatives in the area are Denny's (atmosphere really sucks) or Mimi's (which is very good but can't eat every day).  I have to say that I am a fan of this place and feel that it is my secret little breakfast hang out.",

I thought I remember them being bigger than the omelet from my last visit. Hmm oh well. They get your order right when you customize & add/subtract ingredients.  After having the potatoes at Scramble I fear First Watch's will never compare though.  The Floridian French Toast is really good! You get 2 or 3 pieces of sourdough bread with wheat germ, sliced banana, sliced kiwi, & berries. YUM! It's tasty & it at least feels healthy because of the fruit lol  Last time I was here I got the mango iced tea. Pretty good. I liked it.",

I have been ordering the same dish, the over lightly the entire time....until they removed it from the menu. This has been a huge disappointment.  I believe they need to bring it back with the poppy seed dressing and the sprouts. This is a delicious meal. I am happy to see the improvement on the potatoes and the bread vs. English muffin. Bread and jam are great too. Potatoes should be listed as an option on the breakfast dishes that have a salad. I ordered the classic eggs Benedict today and will never order that again. The plate that it came on was too small and there was too much ham and not enough hollandaise sauce. My husband ordered the seasonal briskit skillet and loved it. The changes to the interior are very nice but will not be happy until the over lightly makes a return. Everyone i have ever brought to First Watch has loved that dish as much as I have. Please bringbit back! Also we had a great waitress today. Good experience.",

I ordered the chorizo omelet and you couldn't really tell there was any chorizo in it until you open it up looking for it and it was little pieces sprinkled throughout, couldn't even taste it. The avocado was cut sloppy in big chunks and little pieces no consistency,  didn't even  bother to take out the stem. We also had the baconador ,basically  the same thing. 2 omelets only 1 cup of coffee with tip $35.00!! guys you need to do much better to keep me coming back. I'll give it 1 more try. Because I usually go to central location and haven't felt this way about my experience. The service was pretty good, so i didn't complain to them but I can make better omelets at home why spend 35 bucks and be disappointed. Please do better I like your menu and concept just execute better sorry only 3 stars this time",

The menu has a perfect assortment of options. Food was fresh and came out in a very reasonable amount of time. We enjoyed the pumpkin pancakes, chickichanga, and the works omelette. Both had coffee and bill was $33.   Decor was modern country, very cute and not cluttered like many restaurants with similar motif. We didn't know the place was here, glad we got the mailer with coupon!",

There was a variety of breakfast items ranging from omelets/pancakes to \"quinoa bowls\" and watermelon cucumber smoothies. My husband had the decadent French Toast Monte Cristo which he really enjoyed and I had a pleasant but bland egg-white Tri-Athlete Omelet stuffed with mushrooms and sauteed onions. I substituted my English Muffin for what turned out to be a stodgy biscuit that wasn't worth the calories.  However, the homemade strawberry jam was!  Our waiter, Jared, was friendly, high energy and efficient.   There was an overwhelming number of senior citizens when we went here. Maybe this restaurant is near a retirement area?  Anyways, the First Watch staff were so nice to all the patrons with canes and health issues. As busy as he was, Jared even sat down for a minute to have a friendly chat with an elderly lady regular who had recently had some kind of fall.",

It comes with two sunny side up eggs. And the toast is super thick multi grain.  The kind I make at home will no longer suffice lol. Will be returning every Sunday. Its kind of tucked away but totally worth checking out. Their fresh pressed juices are to die for and could even be used as a boost for any occasion. I liked the one with turmeric. Wonderful for my swollen pregnant legs. Lol. I tried a bite of my sisters quinoa power bowl and I literally broke into hormonal tears it tasted so flipping good. Best combination with quinoa I have ever had in my life. If i could give ten stars I would. I wish I could remember the waitress name but she was just lovely.",

We got here around 10:30 on a Saturday morning and the wait was about 30 minutes.  We were seated faster than I expected just based on the number of people waiting outside.  I got to chatting with some people next to me who are regulars and spoke very highly of the place, which is always a good sign! The food here was REALLY good.  The portions were very generous; they weren't kidding about the size of the pancakes.  I also liked that their menu had some healthier options- it was all heavy stuff covered in gravy.  I got a blueberry pancake and yogurt/granola.  I definitely could not finish everything.  The pancakes were fluffy and absolutely amazing.  Also, everything that came to our table was super fresh. Next time I'm back in Phoenix, I will probably make another stop here, but maybe I'll see if they take reservations.  Definitely worth it - and the prices were really reasonable too.",

    "text": "First timers at First Watch, we chose this place for Sunday brunch. The food was great, service was spot on, and the seating didn't take as long as I thought it would.   The fresh squeezed orange juice is exactly that and delicious as hell.   That avocado toast?? OMG - to die for!   The seasoned potatoes were tasty, spot on with the onion in the mix.   I don't usually eat eggs, but I made an exception and they didn't disappoint.   The steel cut oatmeal had some bananas and strawberries - they serve the brown sugar and milk on the side so you can sweeten to your liking. Not bad.   The market hash was full of flavor and certainly did not disappoint the lady - she added avocado to her market hash.  Signed up for their emails and by the time I made it home, I had an email for a BOGO.   This place just keeps getting better and better! 8)",

They paired perfectly with the avocado toast - two thick slices of multigrain bread with a generous portion of smashed avocados sprinkled with sea salt. I tried the kale tonic. It was delicious and fresh. Our breakfast had us feeling energized for a good portion of the day. Can't wait to return and try some of the other offerings on the menu.",

Plus the fresh-squeezed juices are always so crisp and light, they really lighten your mood! I also love the homey atmosphere of the restaurant; the whole place is dimly-lit and feels almost like a cabin with all the wood work.  This time I got BLT eggs benedict & pumpkin pancakes. The eggs benedict never fails, with the perfectly poached eggs, fresh slices of vine-ripened tomato and avocado, creamy hollandaise, and lemon-dressed spinach. My favorite part is the toasted sour ciabatta, and how the bacon is crispy with flecks of undrendered fat. My only complaint is how hard it is to eat, but what eggs benedict isn't? 10/10 The pumpkin pancakes, on the other hand, were kind of a let down. They were stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth good, with syrup. Fluffy, with the perfect amount of sweetness. But they definitely woulda benefitted from some more pumpkin in the batter, and topped with some candied pecans. But that's just me. 6/10",

The service is always so friendly and welcoming. Mind you, that this location does get busy, when you walk in you are greeted and welcomed like family. Each server I have ever gotten has been so helpful and impressive. They are great at friendly conversation while handling multiple tables at a time. Not once, has my beverage ever been empty.  The food that comes out of their kitchen never fails to satisfy anyone. If you need a home cooked meal, then come here because that's exactly what they'll give you. Aside from the food being tasty and savory, it will not make you feel sluggish and slow. Unlike most places, First Watch actually cares about what they serve you, only giving out fresh, organic foods. Once you finish, the food actually energizes you and does not weigh you down. It's amazing!   I love everyone at First Watch and if I could I would give y'all 6 stars. Keep up the great work, and thanks for making the environment so enjoyable :]",

We also ordered two iced teas, and our meals and tip were close to a $30 breakfast, which is why I scored First Watch a score of four out of five.  I had three requests for my sandwich:  that that egg be medium pouched, the bacon crispy and the bun grilled and everything I asked for was not overlooked.  I'd certainly give it a try. The staff is very friendly and you will note by the crowd how popular this restaurant is.",

    "text": "Went there for this past Sunday at brunch time. They have the option through Yelp to be put on their wait list, which we opted to do. Super simple to do. Enter how many people in your party and they give you an estimated time of wait. It was 14-24 minutes when I signed in to it.  They even send a text to let you know where you are in line (at that time 12 parties ahead of us and then as we were driving down I checked and it was 5 parties ahead of us). We checked in with the hostess and we were immediately sat! I really like this feature!   Our server, who unfortunately I forgot to make note of her name, was wonderful! She promptly came to our table after we were sat and took our coffee and water order.  After she brought those, she took our food order. Hubby got the works omelette minus the onions and I got the classic eggs benedict. Both of us got the option of potatoes, though fresh fruit was also an option.    Food came out shortly after. Cooked deliciously and abundant! There was so much shaved ham on my eggs benedict. Absolutely delicious! Potatoes were great tasting too.  Our server did come and check on us several times to make sure everything was going good.  Great service, reasonable price, delicious food! We will be back!",

There were two drinks I really wanted and I couldn't decide between the summer blush and morning meditation.  The waitress was so sweet she brought me a sample of both. I couldn't decide still because they were both pretty good so she hooked it up and gave me some of each for the price of one.   The summer blush is watermelon, pineapple, and apple as the main flavors. It tasted predominantly of watermelon with a hint of everything else. It was refreshing in the heat. The morning meditation was orange, turmeric, and ginger as the main flavors. The orange was subtle. The tumeric and ginger were more obvious but lightened by the orange juice. If I had to honestly pick, I liked the morning meditation better.   For breakfast, I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. They came 2 pancakes on a plate with lemon curd and fresh strawberries on top. To be honest, i was so hungry I didn't notice there was no ricotta until now. Maybe it was mixed with the lemon curd but I don't think so. The pancakes were still good without it. The lemon and strawberries go well together.   I also got a side of their bacon and it was super good. It was candied with maple brown sugar and pepper. The bacon was crispy and a little sticky candy coating. The nice thing was it came with 4 slices. I was expecting 2.   I liked it here and would come back.",

We waited about 10 minutes to be seated ( and there were lots of people ) . The server greeted us right away and took our orders.   The food came out pretty quick and the portions were large . Everything tasted amazing . The Chickichanga was different but the favors were delightful . My boyfriend loved his farmhouse skillet . The million dollar bacon really tasted like a million bucks ! So tasty!   All the employees seemed so happy and friendly . The prices are very reasonable . We love breakfast and will definitely be back here again .",

    "text": "Well I had high hopes for this place especially with the fact it states it has vegan options. Now the service was great, our waiter was very attentive and explained what's on the menu. I honestly was hoping for more vegan options then just avocado toast or a bowl of fruits with a coconut puree. Now to be clear it was good and the reason they are getting 3 stars instead of 4 is also because the food my daughter ate wasn't as great. The potato's could have used more time to cook and the waffle was just ok. They do have juices which were good and honestly it's not that bad of a place if you aren't super hungry and looking for a healthier option. Just for me if you are going to advertise that you have vegan options then I believe you should have more than 2 things . Now maybe this isn't their fault but people reviewing them but I just have to state that.   I would prob come back if what I want is just a bow cause again it wasn't bad. The avocado toast was a little lemony but still good. So if all you would like is toast and a bowl then come here if not then you may want to consider another vegan restaurant.",

I was so happy to see such a nice place, it was clean and had a modern rustic decor. The menu had a large selection of trendy options, and the staff was very friendly. We all started with a juice. My traditional husband had fresh squeezed orange but myself and granddaughter opted for a blended juice from the juice bar. We were all pleased with our choices.   For food I was drawn to the Floridian French toast. As a fruit lover I couldn't pass it up. It was beautiful but a little too sweet. I recommend you order a savory side to pair with it. Big enough to share so might be a better option next time. Our table also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and the enchilada dish. We all left happy and excited to find another location in the East Valley as we will definitely go back.",

I ordered the mushroom frittata which came with a small slice of ciabatta bread and a side salad.  I wish it would have come with a large slice of bread and instead of the salad, home potatoes.  I am assuming it didn't because it was supposed to be one of their healthier options.  It was still good nonetheless.  The hubs ordered chorizo omelet and he really enjoyed it.  We were all full by the end of breakfast.  The best part is that you can be put on the wait list through Yelp which means you don't have to sit there and wait with the rest of the world.  It tells you where you are in line and you just have to make sure you check in with the host/ess prior in order to not have your name marked off the list.  I love this feature.

Both times I ordered a AM super fruit bowl. It's a chia seed pudding bowl with two slices of almond butter toast on the side. The first time I ordered it they brought me my chia seed pudding bowl, but forgot the almond butter toast. I ordered again today before I go work out and all I received was a fruit bowl......just a bowl of cut up fruit. I did receive my almond butter toast this time though.  Even though this place is delicious, I suggest eating there vs ordering delivery. They don't know how to get orders right and if they mess up at the restaurant at least you can exchange your food right then and there.",

Fabulous coffee, nice folks, killer pancakes, nice spice in the egg dishes.  I have to say though, and I never thought I would ever write this, say this or even think this, but the TOAST here is the star of the show. Whether you go  whole grain, sourdough or ciabatta, paired with their homemade jam, it is worth the visit by itself. And if you get an avocado mashed in it it is one of the nicer things you will eat all year.   There, a hundred words about toasted bread. I'll take a picture tomorrow when we go again, which is what, 900 more words?",

The food was great and the price was fair, the only thing I was missing was arugula on my sandwich (no biggie). Our waitress was sweet and made sure we were well taken care of, even though we came in close to closing time.    I will definitely be back when I'm in town. Ladies at the front seemed a bit rushed, but they were quick and not rude and didn't leave us waiting. Overall a great place for brunch!",

Food & Drinks: The food tastes fresh, and I don't feel guilty after eating. Everything is healthy and delicious. I pretty much ordered the same thing on every visit - a turkey burger and soup. It was all delicious every time I ordered it. It was nice that I got great food every time. It was consistent. My co-workers were so much more healthier than me. The whole reason we went to this place was for their Kale Tonics, which is a refreshing beverage (if you like that kind of stuff). Lol. I'm not much of a kale person, but everyone else enjoyed it. They have a nice \"pick two\" for lunch with your two choices of soup, salad, or sandwich.",

Don't let the swerving size fool you, it's extremely filling! I couldn't finish the second slice of bread. They also give a generous amount of avocado on each slice. The kale tonic green juice was extremely refreshing! It's a must try!   Customer service was great!

Both were good. However my S.O. ordered the avocado toast and the strawberry smash. I gotta admit, I liked that order better. The avocado has a citrus~y flavor which is interesting in a good way. The strawberry smash is highly recommended. I wanted to change my fresh squeezed OJ to that drink. Staff is accommodating too. I'd give this place an 8/10.",

I had the chickichanga and it was delicious, my brother had Bubbas Benny and it looked just as good. This place didn't blow me away but it made me so happy and full! I would definitely go again, I'd like to see how their lunches are!",

Plus, we felt really uncomfortable in the environment. It wasn't the warm and inviting ambiance that we were expecting. The waitress was very understanding that I did not like my strawberry lemonade (too sweet) and promptly removed it but she still charged me for it. Overall, I was not impressed and probably won't return.",

    "text": "I don't get the reviews.   Short line this AM, quickly seated. Promptly served cold decaf (in thermos pot). Wife ordered benny with HARD eggs, emphasized hard several times as soft turns her stomach. Arrived soft - no one bothered to check. They offer a remake, of course, so now we get to enjoy going out to watch each other eat - together.   My steak and eggs, ordered med-rare comes out blue rare and tough. Egg yolk is broken. Potatoes are cooked to death and hard. Toast and coffee was fine.   Waitress comes back with remade benny, wife tells her my steak is rare, she asks if I want it remade. I put it on the side plate and tell her she can take it to the kitchen to toss it out. She seems offended by my attitude. Can't include my inside voice thoughts here.  She returns a couple of minutes later and tells us the manager comps the bill. Never saw or heard from the manager. Never saw her again.  In my experience, there's a lack of standards here or this many mistakes wouldn't have happened in a single visit. It's an egg place, you'd think they'd have that part figured out.  The manager never bothered to make an appearance, perhaps of the view that your best course of action is to buy off the unhappy customers and hope they don't come back.   You win.   The lesson here is that if you dine here, and your food doesn't live up to the menu, complain a bit and you'll get to eat (sort of) for free!   Probably not as bad as this experience, but there's lots of 'at least as good' options in the area.",

    "text": "I used to love this place, having been here at least a dozen times before.  I even signed up to their breakfast Sun e club.  Today I went with a friend for breakfast, and could tell something was off.  One of the glasses on our table had an old lemon seed in it, no big deal, I just switched the glasses with another table and let the server know.    I ordered the traditional breakfast with poached eggs.  My expectation of a poached egg is that it's cooked on the outside and runny (or at least somewhat) on the inside.  I've had these here before and they were perfectly cooked. However these poached eggs today were solid cooked all the way through, one of them had even apparently broken in the water and there was just a hint of yoke left.    I asked our server, very nicely, if they could be remade.  After 15 minutes of waiting, and after my friend had already finished her breakfast, we were presented with the check and were informed that there would be no eggs for me, the charge was taken off the ticket, but that, per the manager, I still had to pay for the coffee that I drank!?!  I requested to speak with the manager and explained how upset I was that I could be treated that way...how does a restaurant let a customer walk away without their meal?  Without any communication on what happened, or if an alternative would work? Did they run out of eggs?  Did the stove break down?  I'll never know, but what I do know is I was made to feel like I was refused service for sending back my poorly prepared order.  The only reason I didn't give this rating 1 star is because the manager ended up comping our bill, but I still left with no eggs.  Moral of the story, if you send your food back to be remade you may not get any at all.  What a shame.",

I had the \"chikichanga\" which was absolutely delicious. Perfect portion size, and I felt great afterwards. Not the usual stuff-yourself-gross feeling, I felt good! Such a good and chill environment, very spacious with cute decor, and healthy food! A little more pricey than other chain places, but absolutely worth a little extra. (And I'm a cheapskate usually). I will definitely be coming more often. :)",

    "text": "Let me first note I have Celiac disease, if I could eat normal people food, the rating would have been a 5. The rating is based on my experience as a gluten free diner.   I am visiting family and friends in Glendale, and was looking for a celiac safe place to get some breakfast, and First Watch popped up on my Find Me Gluten Free app. When we arrived on Saturday morning it was busy, but we got right in to a table. They had a gluten free menu (copy) available, with suggestions of how to order the food. Many options could be made gluten free, but there weren't any egg-free options, which generally doesn't matter unless you also have an egg allergy, like me. They used to have skillets, where you could just exclude the egg, but they have opted for more main stream options, making it not very satisfying for someone with multiple food allergies. That being said, I ordered a bunch of sides (potatoes, bacon, fruit, and greens with avocado) and it was just fine. Nothing spectacular but it was gluten free, I didn't get sick, and the waiter was very patient with my allergies. I would love to see more variety in the breakfast options, including gluten free bread and english muffins (you can just keep them in the freezer for when your GF people would like some), gluten free pancakes (not rocket science - and my kids would love you forever), and more egg free options.",

    "text": "Food is always excellent and service is generally fantastic, just avoid the sloppy blonde waitress. First she told us they didn't have a specific pancake we asked for that we had gotten the week before, and told us they'd never had it. My boyfriend just asked for something else, and our food was served to us shortly. Everything was delicious, except when she walked by again and literally tossed our ticket onto our table maybe 15 minutes after we received brunch, without a word and walked away. Literally threw it to the extent that we thought she had tossed garbage onto our table. When we were actually ready an hour later we asked for an ice coffee to go and she made a half assed grab for the ticket to add it, as if she really thought it'd be okay to charge me for an ice coffee after she threw the ticket at us when we were both mid bite. A pretty laughable experience, will NOT sit with her again. Otherwise, the rest of the staff is always very friendly, love to make conversation and want to have a happy morning delivering prompt service. Coffee's always fresh and hot, this place stays busy for a good reason and the wait is always accurate. Staff is always clearly working very hard. Two stars because  blondie, otherwise a five.",

    "text": "So, I wanted something to eat this morning, and the thought of coming made me decide to go out to eat instead. I'm tired of blowing up the kitchen, so I decided to come here instead.  This place is located off the service drive of I-17, smushed in between some hotels and next door to the outback steakhouse.  When I arrived, the parking lot looked kind of full, and I thought \"oh great, there's going to be a wait-what did I get myself into?\"  Fortunately, I was seated right away.  The host was friendly and outgoing, and the waitress gave me a menu and offered me some drinks.  I reviewed the menu and decided to order the Cinnamon raisin french toast, and let me tell you, it was delicious!  Three pieces of french toast, with some home made jelly jam tasted awesome!  The place is cutely decorated, with bench style seating, and there's more then enough places to sit.  I was thrilled that I didn't have a wait on a Saturday morning shortly before 10AM, because as you know, breakfast places can be packed at times like this.  They also have a lunch menu as well, which seemed really appetizing.  Bathrooms were clean, and overall, it was a really good experience.  Prices were fair, as my french toast only cost me $7.53 after tax!  I see myself coming back in the future, and this place is definitely worth a try if your in the area for breakfast or lunch.  I think they close at 3PM, so make sure you get there earlier in the day.",

My all time fave power breakfast is the Morning Meditation drink- made with OJ, Beet juice and ginger. Very refreshing!  Along with the morning meditation. I get the Superfood Bowl- chia seed pudding with coconut cream topped with fresh fruit and granola. Oh they throw on a side of 12 grain sunflower seed toast with Almond butter.",

Freshly made everything, some organic, some veggie, free range eggs,  First Watch is breakfast nirvana.    I sauntered here one morning just to see the deal.  I sat down.  My respectful and friendly waitperson looked at me and figured out the deal, yeah, \"He wants breakfast, coffee, a nicely made juice drink and off he'll go to work,\"  And that I did.  The Nicely Made Juice Drink:  I asked what her favorite drink was and she said a combo of  just-pressed kale, carrots and ginger drink.  She figured out I wanted that, so I got it. Deeeeeelish..... my veggies for the morning zapped with a ginger jolt.  The Breakfast:  I asked her what the deal is with the smoked salmon Benedict and she said it's one of the popular dishes here.  She figured out I wanted something not so meaty but substantial.  I relished the freshness of this plate and when I cut into the egg and it sauced the rest of my plate, I reached nirvana.  Lovely breakfast, simple, fresh, high protein. Finito.   The Coffee:  Was better than standard served with half n half,   fake creamers for the hazelnut flavor lovers, and  simple syrup, take your pick.  She figured out that I wanted a togo cup.  Nice.  Happy and content, off  to work he went,  with a bit of a gait,  she predicted.    I was happy all morning. Really.   Service:   Telepathic  Visits:  2  Tip:  Super popular...... OK packed after 9am, lines and waits.   Open till about 3pm.  If you're staying at the Courtyard Marriott Phoenix North, First Watch is litrelly next door.",

    "text": "First watch is an amazing breakfast and brunch place. We have one in our hometown in Alabama and decided to visits the Arizona location after passing by.   Our party of 5 was seated immediately and we were brought water to start. The hostess was very nice and very friendly. Our waitress was also very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu items. Then we were offered other beverage options and our waiter took our order. Our food came very quickly and it was wonderful. The atmosphere is calm and casual and it is a wonderful place to sit and enjoy a healthy meal. However they do have some sweeter options like French toast and waffles.   I ordered the AM Superfoods Bowl to start and the French toast for breakfast because I just couldn't chose between the two and I knew I would share with my family. The superfoods bowl was something I wasn't sure about trying, but I'm so glad I did. It is now one of my all time breakfast meals. I even tried to make it at home - not the same haha. The fruit is super fresh and the granola and chia seeds give it the perfect added crunch. It is also served with their amazing toast covered in peanut butter/almond butter. The French toast is amazing for a sweeter option. It has a delicious taste and is cooked to perfection. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. The biscuits and gravy, eggs benedict, traditional breakfast, it's all amazing. I definitely recommend First Watch!  Photos to show delicious meals!",

I immediately noticed The sour dough toast had blue mold on the crust besides being untoasted and pointed it out to the server. The bacon was limp and rubbery. The eggs looked ok. Had fruit as a side. Our server was Eli and he was very polite. He immediately took the bread and replaced it with more untoasted sour dough.  Needless to say, I did not eat any of my breakfast. Eli took it off the bill. I won't be returning.",

    "text": "First Watch is my first review of the year! My husband raved about this breakfast place. He went on and on about the skillets. During this summer on a weekend, we tried getting brunch there, but sadly, it was too crowded. We walked away, literally to the Outback next door. Today, we succeeded. We arrived at 8:30 am and was pleasantly surprised to get seated immediately. We ordered two Skillet Hash (Parma). We split it among four people.   My skillet was perfect. The eggs over hard was cooked perfectly without being too dry. The highlight was the golden brown, sauteed Crimini mushrooms. I also liked the buttered multi-grain toasts that came with delicious strawberry preserves. My husband's skillet wasn't as nicely presents. His skillet potatoes were underdone, a couple of my potatoes were also underdone. His eggs over easy was a little too runny for him. We enjoyed our little cup of fresh fruit that came with the meal.  For the price of $10.99, I enjoyed the spread, and the portions were more than generous. We did not leave hungry. I hope to be back again. By the time our meal was done, there was a line waiting to be seated. It was an auspicious beginning to the new year!",

The yolk was cooked almost all the way through.  The waiter was very kind about bringing another one but it took awhile.  Also the hollandaise sauce had a flavor I wasn't super fond of.  Will definitely be back to try something else... Maybe the toast with avocado.",

I'm one of those people who doesn't order the same thing twice if I can help it. The menu at First Watch keeps me coming back because there is so much to choose from. They have items from healthy quinoa and juicing to bacon cheddar  pancakes! I like the 1/2 market veggie sandwich with a cup of soup or fantastic un-boring salad. I'm not a vegetarian, but I would certainly contemplate it if all the food tasted as good as that sandwich. Service is another thing...it's always spot on excellent. I believe they like their jobs because the longevity of the waitstaff is astounding. Even after having a baby, two of the women returned. I like the way they all help each other out by delivering food, refilling drink glasses and doing the register at the end. The restroom is always clean even during the busy times at lunch. Go to First Watch and you'll be able to just close your eyes, point to something on the menu and be surprised at how good it tastes, whatever it is you randomly chose to order! Go and have some food fun!",

Talkative and seem genuinely interested in getting to know us, while still keeping the momentum of the ordering and service moving forward at a nice pace.  The Food: Coffee, good, simple brew. They leave a pot on the table for refills - I love restaurants that do that!  I ordered the A.M. Super Food Bowl: coconut pudding, chia seeds, homemade granola and berries. I know, healthy stuff, but this was good!! So many textures and good but not overpowering coconut flavor. And comes with a side of whole grain toast with almond butter - I would highly recommend!  Daughter ordered the Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon - YUM!! The flavors were all there but the smoked salmon definitely takes over the rest. But what do you expect from smoked anything! Comes with side of spring salad and tomatoes. Overall tasty.  Wife got the Elevated Egg Sandwich - on the waitresses recommendation so I hope it's good! Delicious! With gooey yolk dripping out and delicious bacon and fantastic brioche bread! A side of charred home fries rounds it off!  Little guy got the chocolate chip pancakes - hard to screw that up :)  Price: About mid for price. No more than you'd spend at IHOP - and the atmosphere and food are better!  Atmosphere: Very nice. Wood panel and tin walls, with beams across the ceiling and rustic fixtures throughout. Enough lighting coming in to be bright and the staff is so friendly.   Overall, I dig this place very much! Nice place to take the family!",

We arrived with 10 parties ahead of us and we were seated within 10-15 mins. Not bad at all with newspapers from WSJ to keep you busy.   Second, hands down the best breakfast joint we have ever tried here in PHX. We got the millionaires bacon, the elevated egg sandwich, and the farmers biscuit sandwich (I switched the biscuit for a brioche bun). Everything was amazing and my taste buds were in heaven.   The bacon was crispy and tasty. A salty and sweet treat that we ate at the end of our meal actually. I definitely felt like a million dollars after eating it.   Both sandwiches were amazing as well. Crispy buns and all the ingredients just mix so well with each bite. The farmers sandwich had a mayo and apple butter spread that made each bite sweet and salty as well, delicious! I forgot to mention, their potatoes were so good, you don't even need their real, all natural ketchup on the table.   This place is so good, we decided to come again the next day. I'm actually sitting here waiting for my food and writing this review. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. Btw, they do have military discount. Thank you First Watch for appreciating those who serve and who have served.   Enjoy.",

So why won't I be coming back? The food is inconsistent and 3 times that I have dined in they have messed up not only my order but people in my party's order as well and they take forever to bring out the corrected version. The eggs have only been cooked to order once and that was when I ordered to go as I always get over easy eggs, and they always bring them well done.  I like their blt and egg sandwich but again the consistency of how they make it isn't there. One time the bread is toasted, another time it isn't etc. I've tried their omelet with several meats and it and it was very bland.",

I feel like these massive groups typically lead to a decline in service and food quality due to the influx of orders, but that was not the case for our party of 15+ here at First Watch!   Our group debated the old name of this chain (we landed on The Good Egg). The staff were efficient, friendly, and on pointe. All of our orders came out correct and delicious! I split an order of \"millionaire's bacon\" with a few colleagues and secretly wished I didn't have to share that candied bacon goodness.   My brunch choice was a soup and sandwich combo, opting for the seasonal squash soup. I would order this again, but my friends' breakfast plates made me jealous so I will probably get a waffle or omelet next time.   Definitely a trustworthy option for real food, great service, and outstanding bacon.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed breakfast at First Watch. It's a great addition to the breakfast options in the Biltmore area. We arrived at 11 AM on a Sunday morning, and the place was packed- we waited about 20 min for our table, but coffee and water are available while you wait.  We started with juices and enjoyed a green kale-based juice and another gingery one. Both were great! I had the veggie omelet, which was stuffed with mushrooms, kale, and goat cheese, and came with buttered whole wheat toast and a salad! It was so delicious: the veggies were cooked perfectly without being smushy like veggies in omelets sometimes are. My brother had the chickenchanga with potatoes, which he enjoyed. He said the potatoes were fantastic.  Our service was ok; it took a while to get food and coffee, and after our server brought our tab she never came back, so I wasn't able to get a to-go container for my leftovers.   The decor is bright and comfortable, and there are tables indoors as well as in a small patio area in the front. The vibe is low-key and family-friendly, which is nice because a lot of the breakfast places in this area are on the nicer, and pricier, side. Despite the busy-ness, the whole place was very clean! I would definitely come back to First Watch.",

I had the Chickichanga - a breakfast burrito with chorizo, spiced chicken, avocado, onion, cheese, with verde sauce and sour cream. Delicious! It came with a small cup of fresh fruit and some fried potatoes, also yummy. My husband had the BLTE (a BLT with a fried egg) which was huge and delicious. Crispy bacon, fresh bread and greens, and homemade chicken noodle soup. My son had the Trifecta - with French toast instead of waffle even though it's not on the menu. He says thumbs up! My mom also had the Trifecta and says the bacon was perfect, the French toast was great, and the scrambled eggs were also quite good.  We recommend this place and will be back soon!",

    "text": "Pros: Delicious, fresh food. They have an extensive menu of healthy items, fresh juices from their juice bar, breakfast and lunch items. As other reviewers have said, their pancakes are HUGE and my bf and I split a nummy pecan one. We tried the tomato basil soup, chicken quinoa salad, breakfast combo with two eggs, turkey sausage and pancake. My friend got a healthy wrap and enjoyed it. The menu is affordable. Breakfast for the 3 of us was $33 plus tip.  The staff were wonderful and the food came out very quickly. Expect to wait on the weekends for a table.  Cons: I would have ordered a mimosa or bloody mary but alas, they don't have any alcoholic drinks.",

I make better scrambled eggs.  The hubs had the breakfast version of the monte cristo and that was pretty delicious.  He felt guilty eating it afterwards but that's what makes it so good, eh?",

Holly, my waitress was super friendly.  I had ordered the Bacado omelet, which filled with bacon, avocado, melted Monterey jack cheese, along with housemade salsa.   I thought the English toast was a little oily.  I don't know if it was butter or something else.   I usually like drinking stronger coffee, but the blend they had was pretty good.  It wasn't strong or too light.   The food came quickly and hot.  Ambiance is not much, but overall a pleasant experience.",
