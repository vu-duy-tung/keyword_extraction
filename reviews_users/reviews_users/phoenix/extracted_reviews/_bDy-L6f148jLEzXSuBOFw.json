Finally after going through all the headache they over baked and spoiled my pizza.",

    "text": "After reading the earlier reviews...It seems as though the management is reading them and actively making adjustments. The two big \"negatives\" from earlier reviews were the \"frugalness\" of the toppings and the acoustics. Well, seeing as though it is a franchise and there is not much they can do about the acoustics, I am going to ignore that one and solely base this review on the food...  ...Which was outstanding. The \"toppings issue\" from previous reviews was completely absent from my experience. I asked for pepperoni and they put on a lot of it...where all 8 slices each had a few pieces. I asked for bacon and she took an enormous handful and spread it evenly throughout the pizza (I was even a little concerned that it was too much...which is a great problem to have!). All of the vegetables were plentiful and they have an AMAZING selection to choose from. Literally there is not a topping here that you can't get. The crust has a really good thin artisan feel to it, and they allow you to choose from 3 crust butter flavors which is a great little touch. I will say that, by default, they use a small amount of sauce on their pizza (not that they are frugal with it, but this is just how they build their pizza it seems) so, if you are like me and like your pizza decently \"saucy\" make sure to ask for extra marinara sauce!  I know this place opened this week, but I really hope the staff doesn't lose its enthusiasm and professionalism as time goes and they get more comfortable, as you see with so many places. They were all very nice and personable and each had a smile on his/her face. Several times I notices employees and management going around the dining area and asking how their food is and if there is anything they could do for them. Great service guys...keep it up!  Now the price...which is actually pretty decent for a high-concept chain like this. $8 for a pretty large personal pizza (which could feed 2 people, or 1 person two times)  is a good price...$4/serving.",

This is the Chandler location, by the mall.   5 stars for cleanliness. From beginning to start, floors to tables everything was clean. Clean food prep area, clean soda area, clean everything.   5 stars for friendliness. All of the workers were so friendly that I felt like I fit right in. Colin at this location made my pizza and was super nice the whole way through. They were friendly making the pizzas, friendly delivering them to our table, and even brought us napkins.   5 stars for taste. Seriously I may be a pizza God. The toppings I chose were delicious. Original crust with red sauce, and garlic herb around the crust. Tomatoes, roasted red peppers, garlic, mushrooms, artichoke, chicken, and bacon. With mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Delicious!   Needless to say, I will be back. Probably every weekend.",

Since we made plans to hit the gym after dinner, I figured I'd help motivate myself and give myself a goal of burning off like 1,000 calories.  Genius, right [obviously joking but no seriously, I ate that pizza and then punished myself at the gym]?  I got myself half Alfredo's Alfredo and half Mad to Meat You.  I got artichoke hearts and black olives added for some more veggies.  I also got to pick at someone else's half Smokin' Buffalo Chicken and half Rustic Veggie pizza.  Both pizzas had a super generous amount of toppings.  Like I was seriously impressed.  One of the younger ladies tonight carefully placed all my toppings with care as well.  I was surprised since the other two make-your-own pizza places normally just toss everything on haphazardly so I appreciate the attention she gave it.  It ensured for a balanced bite every time.  After everything was topped onto my pie, they asked to make sure I was happy and it was great.  Wonderful service, seriously.  As for the crust, the crust is baked to be super crispy.  There was no way that crust was going to bend.  All in all, I was extremely pleased with Pieology!  This Pieology Pizzeria location just recently opened so everything is nice and clean.  Throughout the whole time we sat there, we had multiple people check in on us to make sure everything was satisfying.  Seriously great service!",

Not sure what's with all the look alike joynts that are popping up a la Chipotle and Einstein's, but I'm not really a fan of these concepts because they require too much work on my part just to order some food.  At any rate, the pizza was decent, but nothing special for me.  I'd get it again, if I just wanted something close by and simple.  Next stop.................Fired Pie and Federal Pizza.",

Soggy crust, colorless meat with a unappetizing flavor. You might as well get a Tostinos frozen pizza and cook it in the microwave.   How can Fired Pie get it right every time, and Pieology fails so hard?",

Now it is 15$ because you have to buy 2 drinks to get 2 5$ pizzas. When I pointed out the the pizzas are now effectively much more than 5$ dollars the shift leader argued with me until she realized that the advertised price and the effective price were different things. She was rude and obviously tired of people being caught off guard by the change at the register. The pizza here is good but the service has been lacking in some way everytime I visit. I am usually pretty cool about things like toppings being put on my pizza I didn't ask for. (happened twice) I was dissapointed at the change in the promotion and the service from the shift leader however. (I guess if paying 2$ for a drink is your thing then this is still a decent deal.)",

    "text": "Pieology vs Fired Pie. A lot people seem to be wondering this.  WHY NOT BOTH!? Here's some things I love about Pieology that Fired Pie kind of lacks in.  1. Supportive, yet perfectly thin, crispy yet tender crusts! Pieology wins here in that the crust perfectly supported the generous amount toppings I had on my Buffalo Chicken pizza (which was bomb, see photo attached). The crusts at Fired Pie are consistently pretty soggy in the middle, and tends to fall apart, considering all of toppings I like to request on my 'zas. By the way, when I asked for a lot of mushrooms at Pieology, they offered me A LOT of mushrooms. They went out of their way to make sure I had enough! Sparse topping hiccups are definitely gone, seems like.  2. Larger store, more seating, more space to yourself! Fired Pie at the 101 tends to feel pretty claustrophobic since it's soooo small and is typically packed. It's kind of like being crammed in someone's living room with 50 other people. Sometimes I don't want to eat right next to a gaggle of screaming kids, and Pieology's large layout allows me to head to a corner and inhale my food in peace.  3. HERB BUTTER OLIVE OIL BASE:  Just go ahead and drown me in this. So buttery, so good. Add the gorgonzola too, it's ridiculously good.  There are some toppings and sauces that Fired Pie has that Pieology doesn't. And I'll be going back there occasionally when I'm in that area (especially if it's not currently jam packed with tiny screaming people) but I'm SO glad Pieology opened, because they are just as great and in a few ways better, so the real question is... WHY NOT BOTH?!",

I wanted to take my mom to get pizza while visiting from out of town. The line took 30 mins exactly due to having the timer set on my phone for my lunch break. Once getting to the front, Us two vegetarians were very grossed out to see all the cross contamination of putting the dirty gloves of the raw meat and then back into the vegetable containers and then into the oregano and salt and then going back to the raw meat and back to the veggies. Vegetarians and diet restricted individuals come to places like this to be able to get gluten-free and vegetarian options. It is very disturbing to see the cross contamination and not sanitary service line. We also asked for it to be cut clean and they did not understand why. When we said wow that took 30 minutes in line the cashier replied and said well there are only 3 of us instead of apologizing or giving any type of sympathy to the time we spent still giving you our $20+ business. Management please Educate your staff about vegetarian cleanliness and cross contamination.",

As someone who is intolerant to Gluten, Dairy, Soy AND Peanuts I'm not someone who regularly gets to eat food the majority of the population would call 'good'.   Pieology is my one exception. Their gluten free crust, along with the dairy free Daiya mozzarella they carry are a lifesaver for someone like myself with severe food intolerances. Despite the kitchen being an easy place to cross contaminate dishes the crew have ALWAYS taken amazing care of me and I've never gotten sick on one of their pizzas in the almost 40 times I've gone to this place since it's opened.   Not only is the food awesome and edible for people with intolerances the service is the best thing of this store. I consider Collin, Caleb and Alysha as friends of mine and I've never walked into the store without someone sparking great conversation. All three of them are the freaking best, and they deserve a bonus FOR SURE Mr Manager ;)   Thanks for being such an awesome crew of people and such an amazing place to eat. I owe my taste buds to this damn restaurant :)   Also, it's not a bad place to catch some epic Pokemon if you play Pokemon Go",

I much prefer Pieology to any other fast-fire personal pizza place because they don't burn the bottoms and the sides of their pizzas. I always order mine with the high-rise crust (I think that's what it's called) for $1 more, it makes the pizza tastes that much better. My husband and I used to get two individual pizzas but since we'd never finish ours, we just started getting half and half on one pizza. It saves money and that way we don't have any leftovers to store and possibly forget at work. He usually gets pepperoni, mushrooms, and pineapple on his side and I usually get just cheese or chicken, roasted red peppers, spinach, and garlic. The service is always friendly but I do find that it doesn't matter if I place my order ahead of time; it's most likely not going to be ready when I get there. I had an hour lunch so I'd usually go before my husband and order so it'd be ready when he got there fifteen minutes after me.  It's a little out of the way now but I'd definitely go back again and again.",

I got a good sized pizza with a pile of toppings for $10 including tax. I took a lot of it home. And it was delicious! I got their new thick crust, it was crispy and wonderful.  I told the owner that some of the reviews said their pizza was soggy, he said pizza is a matter of personal taste on how well it should be done and that they are always happy to leave a pizza in a little longer if someone wants it crispier. Kayla took my order, and she was super nice, and Michael brought me my pizza. I accidentally asked him for extra mozzarella instead of marinara, he happily brought the cheese but when he overheard me telling my friend I'd asked for the wrong thing he brought the marinara too.  The food was excellent and the people were fantastic! I'll be going to this place again and again.",

    "text": "Best pizzas ever!   I only came here because I dog seat for my neighbor and they gave me a gift card for this restaurant. Since I am not a big fan of pizza, I wasn't expecting much more than pizzas I had anywhere else. As soon as I walked in, we got a friendly welcome shout out all the way across from the kitchen. Then, we line up to pick different ingredients for sauce, toppings and veggies for flavor. Within 15 minutes, the pizza was ready to go.   For my pizza, I picked white dough, garlic oil sauce, mozzarella, Italian sausage and meat. For veggies, I picked jalapeno, onions, garlic, sweet tomatoes, cucumber....I honestly don't even remember what else I had picked. THAT pizza was the best one I've ever had. The crust is very thin and Evert bite is juicy and delicious.  I would have finished the entire 11 inch pizzas if I would.   I will most definitely come back here again.",

First -One pizza we had the regular crust which was flavorless. Think frozen pizza. The other was a whole grain crust. I thought it was funny when the girl said it tastes just like regular crust. Umm...it shouldn't and it doesn't. Sadly, it didn't taste the same but was still not good.   Next - they put on WAY too much sauce, even as we were telling her LIGHT sauce. They don't have \"fresh mozzarella\" as an option here (which is soooo good!) I'm spoiled and want my fresh mozzarella I admit it.   Lastly - one piece of meat in each slice of pizza. One. Seriously??   We each ate a minimal amount. My husband threw his away. I couldn't just toss it after just one piece so I boxed the rest and took it home. Every time I looked at it in the 'fridge my stomach said \"Nooo, you don't want to eat that!\"  Eventually I tried one of the pieces of Canadian bacon then threw the rest away.   I see people really like this place but I've been spoiled. I simply can't enjoy a cheap pizza that tastes cheap, no matter how many toppings I can put on it.",

    "text": "Are you a fan of statistics? I'm not. Probably my least favorite subject in college. But I really found these interesting: Out of 66 Yelpers rating Pieology: 40 have done less than 10 reviews and 20 of those have done 1 or 2. Of those 20, 19 gave a 5 Star. Only 5 reviews were done by Elite Yelpers and only 1 of them gave Pieology a 5. The other 4 gave it a 4. Only 17 reviewers \"checked in\" which actually validates that the reviewer was really there. The most recent 18 reviews were all 5 Stars.  Well, that is until this one. Don't misunderstand me. I liked Pieology. The food was... fine. As good as most of the fast casual create your own pizza places.  C got a half day at school so he and I decided to check out Pieology. C got the create your own Pie ($7.95). His was basically a meat lovers type pie. Sausage, Pepperoni, meat ball, Mozz and red sauce. It was interesting that he didn't finish it though and not because it was too big. I ordered the Create Your Own Salad ($9.95) So before I even start, this is 2 bucks more than the other places charge and seemed to be a bit smaller. Sure, the produce was fresh and ultimately the salad tasted fine. But what am I paying 2 bucks for? I wouldn't come back for a salad. No staff ever came by to see how we were doing and unfortunately my interaction with the \"manager\" was listening to him talk on the phone with a customer about a catering order. For 5 minutes or more. Put it this way, by the time he was finished talking on the phone and rang us up, C's pizza was ready. Next time, transfer the call to the office and have another employee ring up customers. Standing at the front counter waiting to get rung up wasn't cool. So all in all, the food was fine. 5 Star worthy, nope. 4 Star worthy, not today. Average food, higher prices than the competition, service needs improvement. 3 Stars.",

This could be part of why we didn't love this pizza. Two of our pizzas were Gluten Free, the dough was a standard GF option, nothing exceptional. A bit sweet tasting. The center was very soggy. The veggie toppings were still completely raw. I prefer my onion, peppers and mushrooms to be cooked with the pizza, not just thrown on after. We also had a regular BBQ Chicken pizza. It was NOT good. My husband  only ate two pieces of it and threw the rest away. That was a bummer. I'd be willing to try this place again....but so far, it just didn't wow me.",

From the service to the taste of the pizza, the freshness of the ingredients, the pizza was piping hot and the crust was crispy and the cheese was gooey. We went back today and holy crap, talk about lack of consistency. The ingredients from the get-go looked not very appetizing and not fresh. The veggies were turning colors and wilting. When they cooked out pizza and delivered it to our table, it was barely warm and the meats were still cold. The pizza was super watery and we didn't even put anything on the pizza that would cause so much water to come out. As I was eating my pizza I got a funky taste of what a rotting, wet rag would probably taste like and stopped eating the pizza. My husband started picking at the pizza, trying one ingredient at a time and he also tasted something that had gone bad. We didn't complain because it's not like they would give us our money back and we didn't want them to remake the pizza. We won't ever be coming back here.",

I ordered two pizzas online. I purposefully went to pick them after my scheduled pick up time hoping to give them a chance to cool off. They were just going in the oven when we arrived! They cooked really fast, so I assumed they were just reheating them. When the cook showed the pizzas to me, I didn't pay close attention to how well done the toppings were which proved to be a HUGE mistake. We got the pizzas home. The toppings looked a little undercooked  but we still devoured them. Then a few hrs after, all heck broke loose! Both of us were doubled over in pain with stomach cramps. The cramping was the least of our worries. We've had to cancel all plans for the day since we can't venture too far from the restroom (use your imagination). Shame on me for not asking them to cook the pizzas longer. Shame on THEM for serving undercooked pizzas. Lesson learned. And this is one lesson that will NEVER be repeated.",

The variety of toppings were great and well-organized for a make your own pizza place. The pizza was prepared right in front of you, freshly baked and then brought to your table within a few minutes. My only complaint is that the crust was a little thin for my taste.   It is conveniently located near our house, which is why I question why I have never been here before. The staff was friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make you feel welcome. The environment is really cool and casual with an industrial and modern design to it. Whether you want to dine in or get your custom pizza to go, this place has something for everyone.   Can't wait to go back and try something else!",

I have never seen this place understaffed and consistently has customers throughout the day. I highly recommended this custom pizza over others because of the amount of options you have for toppings here. Once you eat here you'll miss these options elsewhere.   The restaurant itself is very neat with a wide open feel. Always a place to sit and the furniture has an industrial look. Extremely friendly staff would be my final note.   Check it out!",

The most I've seen is maybe 10 people.  Though it may not be full, this place is delicious with a very awesome location. The pizzas are always loaded full of toppings and even if you wanted more just ask and they will do whatever they need to make the best pizza for you! Absolutely amazing preset menu options as well as customizable options with toppings ranging from pineapple to buffalo chicken and everything in between.  From a customer standpoint everyone here has always been very nice, welcoming and informative if you don't know how something may work. Another big thing is the workers always stay busy even when there's no customers in line. They are cleaning something, restocking something or whatever else they may find to do it gets done. And it shows. This place is spotless, not a speck of dirt or anything to be found. No fingerprints or smudges on the all glass doors or windows.  I've been coming here for a bit since it opened and I will continue to come back. Thanks for always filling me up!",

He was putting ingredients up, which is fine, I get it, you have a tasks to do BUT when we are directly across from one another and you couldn't even say, hello, I will be right with you. No one was in the restaurant. One pizza was in the over and no line!   After three minutes I said, are you guys closed? He said no, I have to take this pizza out. I looked at him and mentioned he should at least greet someone when they walk in as well as the fact we are directly across from one another. No apology.   I left and decided I would go to fried pie (a place I've been before).   Customer service is everything. Quality of food is key but first impressions last a lifetime. Terrible first impression.",

On the one hand a decent line had now formed so they had to rush and try to fill orders, on the other hand you have a customer on a to-go order already having waited 20+ minutes and, shockingly, other folks may want ranch at some point as well; 1 of the 5 people back there could have been pulled.

I was excited to give Pieology a try after hearing good things and being so poorly disappointed with Fired Pie.  Walked into a busy line, which was a good sign.  It was moving at a snails pace, but I was chatting with a co-worker in line so it was tolerable.  Get up to the veggies.  No broccoli left.  None in back.  Fine add some Basil.  No basil.  Five minutes later some found and added.  Asked for lots of chicken and they did so.  Bonus points here.  Spent another 5 minutes waiting for someone to come to the register to ring up the order.    When the order came up only half of it arrived.  A pie was missing.  They finally located it.  The food tasted decent, but not amazing.  Overall the staff was friendly, but not really outgoing.  I will end up giving them another try.  Maybe they were just having a bad day.  Suggestions.  Get staff to have some enthusiasm and a little bit of giddy up in their step.  Keep trimmings stocked during peak times of the day.  People shouldn't have be leaving the line to go dig up bins.",

I got the thick crust (something I've never seen at similar concepts) with your basic house red sauce, mozz, salami and tomatoes. The crust was INCREDIBLE. It was the perfect amount of fluffiness and crispness. The pizza also came out within 4 minutes! My boyfriend got the traditional crust  with Alfredo, spinach, and mushrooms. The Alfredo had the perfect flavor and it was very cheesy!  We got 2 pizzas and a lemonade for only $21 dollars. Not to mention, they have some really good lemonades as well. We got the watermelon mint lemonade--amazing.   We will definitely come back next time the pizza cravings kick in!",

When we were in the OC a while back, we were looking forward to ordering a pizza from Pieology in the Irvine Spectrum. We had read so many positive reviews about their \"brand\", we couldn't wait.   Well, let's say it was a dud. Screaming kids, disinterested employees, managers running around cleaning tables and the most disgusting prep area with everything mixed together. The fact that our pizza order was goofed up was the smallest issue. The size for that location was tiny and over crowded.   Okay, with that backdrop and with much trepidation I came here for lunch yesterday at 2:30. Whoa, what a difference. First, the interior was cavernous, as my photos I hope shows.  Second everything was immaculate. Really, you could eat off the floors and that was after a busy lunch hour.   I give the credit to all this to their management team and Mike (see photo) their handlebar mustache leader and head Pie-Oologist.  We had a chance to chat, turns out he trained in their Irvine and Tustin locations.  Clearly he learned a lot because I came away impressed. In making my pie. he threw away five dough palates as not being made right.  Wow, great quality control!  I ordered a meat pie with garlic, spicy marinara and banana peppers.  It was outstanding and only $7.95.  I'm glad I tried this Pieology because it lives up to their reputation.  Thank you, Mike!  So, Four and Half Stars, bordering on Five.",

The employees greet people right away, and I like the clean, sunny room.    Initially they seemed to be a little disorganized on keeping track of whose pizza was where in the oven, but that should work itself out in time.  They tried to give me Ed's pizza, and Ed's pizza looked pretty good, full of meat, mushrooms, and olives, but I'm not Ed.    I took my pie home to scarf in private and really enjoyed the flavors.  The garlicky olive oil is very nice and fresh tomatoes and basil make for a perfect mix of flavors.  I just think the grape tomatoes might not be the best idea.  They fall off easily.  Some sliced romas might work out better.  The crust was crisp and buttery, just like I like it.  Overall this is a great addition to all the restaurants by the mall.  And the price...can't beat the price...$7.95 plus tax equals a pizza for $8.57, and I only ate half of it, I swear!",

The business model is sort of like Kramers idea in the Seinfeld episode crossed with Chipotle business model. You design your own pizza by choosing crust, sauce, cheeses and toppings from a wide variety. You see your pie being assembled so you can fine tune the assembly process, a little more of this, a little less of that. Or you can lack imagination like me and pick a package off a short list of options and customize that.  The ingredients are first rate and plentiful. And the pizza comes to your table within seconds of being out of the oven. It doesn't get any fresher than that.  Tucked away at the wrong end of a strip mall, this place is a bit hard to find. But it is definitely worth the effort.",

My wife had been to one In San Jose, Ca about a year ago and loved it. Since I hadn't I figured I try it out. I had a fairly loaded pie on wheat crust while the wife had her two meat with lots of pineapple on reg crust. I was impressed with the fresh selection of toppings( missing was Roma tomatoes and anchovies if you like them..I don't really). The crusts are formed on a pretty cool looking press from fresh dough made earlier. Thus only affords one thickness of crust that is a thin type. After a 15 min bake time in their fired oven our pies were ready. Mine was very good, probably one of the best thin style pizzas I've had here in the desert valley. Crust was perfectly crisp around edges and not soggy in middle with all the toppings I had on it. Again a great pizza and experience overall. David came by and made sure we were well taken care of.",

    "text": "I ate here at Pieology for the first time on May 21, 2018, when they had the Monday $5 pie (good only if you purchase a drink too) promotion.  I ate with a group of 8 \"Cheap Eats MeetUp\" people.  Now that I tried Pieology, I like Fired Pie and MOD Pizza the best, and Pieology the worst of the four because Pieology crust was like doughy shoe leather and not a \"crust\" at all.  Pieology ingredients didn't taste that great either.  I also did not like Pieology because the location I went to at Chandler Mall (101 and Chandler Blvd) did not have napkin dispensers at the tables like Fired Pie did.  Napkins are only at the drink station.  So if you are sitting on a long bench, people have to slide out to let ME out to  get more napkins.  I was embarrassed, because I found I needed a fork, then I needed cheese, but there were no more anywhere i could see.  only chili pepper shakers.  Then I needed him to scoot out yet again, cos I needed more napkins.    When I had my pizza made, I specified I wanted it WELL DONE \"to the point that the crust is burnt black at the edges\".  I told them \"don't worry about making it pretty, I want the edges burnt!\"   Well the person who built the pizza isn't the person who attends to the baking.  When the pizza was brought to my table, I did taste it and nothing was burnt, the edges looked the same color as the center and and I would not consider it \"well done\" at all.  I told the guy who was bringing another person their pizza, and he said he would take it back to bake more \"just like this\" (I think he meant in the pan they transferred it to), even tho it was already sliced and paper was there.    When it came back, it still wasn't burnt either, but somehow, it was no longer crispy like the first time it arrived at my table.  The first time, they baked in a pan with lots of holes in it for crispy crust.  I was disappointed and just ate two pieces.  The crust was not at all crispy, and dough was like soaked cardboard, really hard to pull apart and cut.  And the pizza was hopelessly stuck to the paper, so gooey it was, I had to peel off the bits of paper stuck to it, or leave the pizza behind on the paper and not eat it.  I never had that experience at MOD, Humble Pie, and Fired Pie, which I ate at Fired Pie only 3 days before, so my good experience there was fresh in my mind to compare with Pieology.     Another thing I noticed about Pieology is not all the ingredients are signed on the glass, such as I did not see artichoke hearts, which I had my heart (no pun intended) set on, but when I said \"You don't have artichoke hearts?\", pizza builder said \"Oh yes we do, right here\", pointing to a very depleted bin (not enough int here to tell they had it, visually).  They also did not have two of my favorite pizza ingredients, 1. Kalamata olives and 2. Anchovies  Also I noticed here, that the salad fixings and list of dressings were scattered among the pizza ingredients both on the signage and the bins.  I had to scrutinize harder to pick out the pizza choices from the salad choices.     The staff was very cheerful and accommodating. One guy in our party \"lost his pizza\".  It turned out when they delivered it to him, he did not recognize it (I said it looked like it had fried eggs on it).  Time went by and when it was finally determined that it WAS his order, the same employee who recooked my pizza, said he would make him another one, since this one got cold.  One thing I liked about Pieology was they had canned sparkling soda called Alta Palla in several flavors.  The fruit juices (only 5%) are organic and uses cane sugar instead of awful high fructose corn syrup.  the cost for 12 oz can isn't more than the fountain drinks, tho no free refills.    I don't think I will be back to Pieology even for $5 Monday plus the drink, as MOD, Fired Pie, and Humble pie are all much closer to my home, and I like the crust, ingredients, and set up better.  But it was worth a try and now I tried all four build your own pizza restaurants.",

The place looks like any other franchise chains like chipotle or pei wei. The place was clean and service was quick.   I ordered the rustic veggie, the pizza dough base was done in front of me and one can add any number of toppings they want. The thin crust and fire baked was spot on. The sauce was delicious. I could eat the whole pizza easily. I loved every bit of it, this was one of the best pizzas I have had.   The price is remarkable and would recommend it to pizza and non lovers.",

Once you're done ordering, they check you out to pay your bill and hand you a number. There's plenty of clean seating areas within the restaurant even outdoor seating. I would also like to mention the fountain drink area has a bunch of options. They have unlimited refills for sodas, teas and lemonades. The quality of the food is delicious. Oh! If you check in on Yelp, you will receive a free fountain drink for your visit. Lastly, they offer military and first responders discounts! Winning! I will definitely be a returning customer.",

The space is huge and well ventilated (Maybe a little too much so since it was a bit chilly in there but I will take slightly chilly over super warm!). I browsed through the menu before deciding on the rustic veggie pizza. The Yelp check-in offer was for a free fountain soda- nice! The grand total was $7.95 pre-tax for my pie, about the same you'd pay at similar personal custom pizza places.  The pizza came out in a few minutes, delivered right to my table. It had a plentiful amount of vegetables such as red and green bell peppers, corn, onion, and aromatics such as garlic and fresh basil. There was a thin layer of tomato sauce and it was topped with mozzarella and ricotta.   Overall, it was a pretty good pie. The sauce wasn't overpowering and was well balanced against the other ingredients. I liked the thin crispy crust which had a slight amount of chewy give when you bit into it. The vegetables were cooked yet still retained their crispness, to contrast with the creamy texture and slight salinity of the cheese. I would have liked a little more fresh basil on the pizza though, and in larger pieces.   Out of all the quickie personal pizza places in the Phoenix area this is one of my favorites so far!",

Highly recommend,  10 out of 10, would eat again.",

    "text": "Getting food at Pieology is always a welcome delight. I'm not huge on the make-your-own pizza concept, but as far as it goes, the chandler and 101 pieology does well.  I always feel like I get a well-sized portion and the \"pizza-crafters\" are excellent at advising my creations and preventing potential flavor combination doomsdays. The real thing of note however, is the people. Joshua (the manager, I think) and Collin served as a reminder tonight as to why i keep returning to pieology. Colin is always chipper, making me feel like a friend as he makes my food, and Joshua makes sure I'm having a great experience and checks in at my table to make sure everything is perfect. As said, make-your-own-pizza is so-so to me, so I guess you could say the people are what make this place great. Regarding environment, the place has a welcome wide-open feel and is super clean. Great quality food and positive people make chandler pieology a great place to study excellent food service.",

    "text": "This was our first visit and really didn't know what to expect. Very open space with table and bench seating. We were greeted warmly and gave our order to a friendly young lady. She helped us with our selections and made the pizza. We ordered the thin crust with spicy chicken and bacon. Half with black olives. Olive oil with red sauce as a base and added some cilantro. They put the pizza in the fire and you go and get your drinks from the usual convenience store dispenser. Within about five minutes the friendly employee brought our pizza. Looked real good. She suggested Ranch Sauce to go with our spicy chicken. I'm not good with very spicy food. Great suggestion. The pizza was very, very good. The crust was cooked just right. It was nice and golden with a slight crunch. One of the best I've had. The pizza overall was very good and we'll be back. Talked to the manager who was friendly and told me about the \"history\" of Pieology. They are a national brand and have over one hundred and forty stores. Pretty aggressive growth since opening in 2010. They now have a thick crust, but again we had the thin. Would recommend and we'll be back. So much better than Pizza Hut, Dominos etc. I would put it up there with a very good pizza I had in St. Louis (yes, St. Louis) in the Italian place called The Hill. Nice job.",

Plus, I'd been eating a ton of it this past week. Because of my lameness, I opted for the classic salad. It was tasty but would have been better if the chicken was warmed. My family loved their pizzas and now, I can vouch for it's deliciousness because I snagged some leftovers. The main reason I rated this restaurant five stars though is because of the exemplary service we received from the assistant manager, Mike. He was so funny and personable! At the risk of sounding thirsty, I've gotta say, he's damn cute too (holla at me Mike :-p). Seriously though, as someone who has worked in customer service for many years, he's a great example of how a manager should interact with customers. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!",

The last piece was real soggy. Now it's the way it's baked is what was explained to me. That quick of a bake won't sustain the crispness that long. Now I will say it's MUCHO MUCHO better than fired pie. Also the jalapenos weren't that hot at all. More tangy than anything else hence the minus one extra star.  Now they have a happy hour between 2pm and A4pm so that's nice. $5 pies. That's nice.",

The pizza was perfect as usual, thin crust with the middle being perfected baked and not dry! I love that they always place a generous amount and the service was superb! For the price of this pizza you cannot go wrong! We were helped by a very nice man by the name of scout I think, he did an excellent job greeting and making sure we had everything we need, cracked a few jokes with my name Jenny and was very positive and happy!

They got manager who then tried to double charge for my meal lol. Poor guy didn't know what was going on.  That aside, the place was a disaster hopefully from being busy. They don't have afterbake ranch at this location. They brought my pizza with out my afterbake lol, they fixed it lol. Keep in mind this is just what i saw when i came in. Hopefully my pizza is as good as normal My original pizza did not taste good was undercooked. So we are in process of remaking the new one for me to take home. Love this place to much to lose a location",

Since moving to Arizona, we were repeatedly disappointed with the pizza options at each restaurant we went to. Pieology was a surprising exception.  Love how you can create your own pizza with the toppings and type of dough and sauce. Totally different from standard east coast style pizza, but our orders turned out delicious. We got artisan thin crust, and I think we're going to stick to that as our go-to since it was pretty tasty. I got the smokin buffalo chicken and ranch dip on the side - DELICIOUS!  Love that they have kid portions too. My daughter was happy with her mini pizza pie.  I wasn't a big fan of the garlic cheesy bread - way too much garlic for my personal preference. I'm not a fan of the overpowering garlic aftertaste.  Service was great - friendly and attentive. Environment was OK - small and a little dark. Had a fast food place type of feel. One star off for dirty tables and chairs. When we sat down, I had to wipe it off myself.  Overall, I'd come back again.",

Similar to Fired Pie (select ingredients through a line up).  However fired pie tends to undercook the dough so we stopped going.  It was a late night hunger stop and we thought what the heck.  Selections are great and the staff was nice.  We purchased a pizza with half pepperoni and half veggie.  Simple.  Loss of a Star due to lack of cleanliness.  It was hard to find a table that wasn't sticky and the garbage was decidedly full.  Second visit tried the double pizza and it was also awesome!  Manager spoiled my son and helped us learn the app!  All around our new favorite place!  Upgraded to 5 stars!!!!!",

Yes, $8, and you can have all the toppings that you want, from a list of 40 choices.  In other words, no matter what you do, your pizza can never cost more than $8 (unless you get gluten free, but I don't).  Third, it cooks fast, really fast.  So nothing against Spinatos, Florencia, Belle Italia - they are all truly great, and I will miss them.  But pizza this tasty for $8 wins.  My wife and I can now have 2 completely different 12\" pies $16.  My days of dropping $25 for a pizza, and paying $2/topping are over!",

And Fired Pie was there first. I liked MOD overall. The staff was friendly and everything was clean. I must say, I did have diarreah pretty bad after eating here.  It could have been something else I ate, but, certain restaurants do that. My Dr said I am highly sensitive to MSG and many restaraunts have MSG in the ingredients, even unknowingly (MSG can be hidden and disguised in other ingredients). My husband ate with me, he liked it a lot and also liked it better than Fired Pie. He loves Siracha and ranch, they offer it after your pizza is made. He was happy.",

Both Mike and Mariah have recommend choices I wouldn't have tried otherwise ( who would have thought Alfredo and BBQ sauce would be good?.....well it's fantastic) and Have loved the different combinations every time.

We had the opportunity to try the barbecue chicken and Alfredo. The bbq chicken was nice but the Alfredo lacked depth of flavour which was odd as everything smelled good and the  ingredients were very fresh. While I may not go back anytime soon others may enjoy this more than we did and are encouraged to try it at least once.  Special shout out to Colin who was very enthusiastic and funny.",

Unfortunately when they say unlimited toppings in my opinion I don't think they really mean it. They are very frugal with the amount of toppings they put on, especially the meats. I asked for extra bacon and could barely see any. Same goes for the sausage. The local competition means it when they say unlimited toppings and when you ask for extra bacon or another meat, you get it! I will say that Pieology's pizza crust is definitely better and more crispy than the local competition in Chandler. Not sure yet if I'll return...",

They used a press to flatten out the dough, which made it a lot more dense than it would have been if they would have thrown the dough to stretch it out.  I didn't like the consistency of the dough, which is the main reason of the three star review.  The toppings seemed fresh enough, and the staff was nice considering I was here on Christmas Eve and it was less than busy (we were the only ones there at 11:30 AM).

Essentially what you have with Pieology is one of those custom pizza eateries (you choose the crust, you choose the sauce, you choose the toppings, etc.), and the restaurant also offers up some basic choices that are tried and True choices.  Then you take your seat, and the staff brings out your pie after its been blazed quickly in one of those fancy ovens.  So the flavor really depends upon what you're in the mood for, but the combinations are pretty amazing.  What you like, you can choose.  Excellent choices, and the wait has always been relatively short, even when they had a pretty packed house.  Kudos!",

When I got the pizza, there were several slices without a single mushroom.  That's just one topping.  Pepperoni was the same, some slices had 2 pieces of nickel sized pepperoni.  Honestly, if \"Unlimited Toppings\" is going to be your tag line, live up to it! It seems like the employees were scared to death to give up the toppings!  I agree with the acoustics of the building. Everything echoes so loudly, it's hardly a relaxing atmosphere, and that was with just 5 customers in the building.  I can only imagine what it sounds like on a busy day.    Hopefully there are just some opening jitters that will work themselves out.  I just recently discovered Fired Pie, and then when I saw Pieology, I was excited because it's closer to home.  I was disappointed with this first visit, so hopefully things turn around quickly.  If they won't go the extra mile, I will, straight to the competition.",

There are other made-to-order pie places that I frequent however, not as much as I do Pielology. This establishment is larger than most so allows for the larger crowds to stand in line, order and not feel crowded by people. Ugh!  The service here at Chandler Fashion Square is exceptionally good. I'm always greeted with a smile and a nice gesture when I exit.   The addition of olive oil on the crust before baking adds a slight crunch to the bite that...Ohh Emm Gee...it's hard to explain. They offer both regular and wheat crust (wheat is the way to go). The pie size appears to be larger than most places leaving me with 1/2 a pie every time (perfect for my inner chubby kid). The toppings here are fresh and the tomatoes (they have the cherry tomatoes halved...just how I like 'em...way better than regular sliced or roma).   Pieology is my first choice for made-to-order pizza; even though there are two different places closer to my home. The longer ride is totally worth the pie!",

It was alright, not amazing or out of this world. Pretty cool that you can customize it and make it your own for a set prize, employees were awesome and helpful, it just didn't do much for me. The pizza dough was rather bland and although I love thin crust I wasn't sure I liked this crust..I had the buffalo pizza which was pretty good but surprisingly spicy for me, I will go back because the hubby enjoyed it and maybe another pizza will do it for me...as of now I'm still on the fence about it.",

The pizzas seem slightly bigger, and the guys working here are super friendly and efficient. Pro tip: Sign up for their mailing list to get a free pizza for your birthday with the pie haze of another. Also, try the alfredo sauce - it's delicious. And if you don't think you'll like it, just get it on half your pizza.",

    "text": "I love the custom personal pizza concept, and Pieology does it very well.  My main basis of comparison is Fired Pie, which I also recommend. What is different about Pieology?  1. I felt like the employees wanted my pizza to be just how I wanted it. They made sure I was happy with the amount of meatballs and asked if it looked right before and after baking it.  2. The pizza, although still thin crust, seemed like a much more substantial meal. Part of it is 11.5\" versus 11\" in the base size, and part of it is the amount of toppings used. Fired Pie workers will only put a certain amount of toppings on a pizza for cost and balance reasons. Pieology put noticeably more toppings on my pizza, even though I am sure they have a limit, too.  I got a filling, customized personal pizza for under $10 after tax, and it was prepared with great friendliness. I will be back for sure.",

    "text": "Fantastic staff, all friendly, patient, hardworking and helpful. It's the little things that showed us they were considerate of their customers. For example, mentioning to us that the Margherita pizza didn't come with sauce and asking if we wanted to add sauce onto it, answering all our questions, and they all make sure to welcome and also say goodbye to the customers. They also set out takeout containers by the soda machine where you can easily get them if you need to take some leftovers home. This is the Chipotle of pizzas. I personally love how they used minced garlic instead of cloves. They also had some less common pizza ingredients (like artichoke) that some may enjoy. Because it's a thin crust pizza, it cooks quite fast. The inside of the restaurant felt really clean and new. Definitely a great spot if you want something different.",

The guys behind the counter were entertaining and engaging. Gus has great taste in jeans and fired our pie like a pro. Mike was the comedian of the bunch, and knows a prolific tattoo artist. They made some great suggestions, then cut us loose to build or own pie and salad. Portion size was great, and the crust was thin and crispy, like I asked for. I LOVE the concept and will return here to try other combinations. Value for the price was excellent, and the variety and freshness of the toppings was Impressive. Thanks, Pieology, for a memorable first visit!!",
