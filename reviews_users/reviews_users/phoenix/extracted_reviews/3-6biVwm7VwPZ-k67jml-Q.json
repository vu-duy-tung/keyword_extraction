However I ordered the grilled calamari and it was off the hook!  It was a fun casual atmosphere.  The only thing that was a turn off to me was the gal that took my order at the counter.  Her attitude was anything but friendly and very disinterested to communicate.....not very sociable or polite.  I guess that would be the norm if ordering in a NYC restaurant, but it is Scottsdale!!!  I will try anything twice.  Hey, not every experience is a home run!  I went again specifically for a glass of wine and the grilled calamari, and it was just as amazing as the last time.  The gal behind the counter taking my order.....was also the same attitude as last time.  I guess if I go back I can ask my date or the person I am with to order.  There is something to be said about attitude!!!",

Oh and they have a big sign that says'' ''We have the right to refuse service to anyone'' Better not be dark-skinned, disabled. gay, or look at the Scorzo clan the wrong way. So many places are better than this one. DeFalco's  or Guido's Deli are great options and in Scottsdale as well.  Nothing but an overpriced ''hoytie toy tie'' joint for non-italian folks who go there thinking they got something special. Trust me they didn't! I was born in emilia-romagna, Italia.  This place is a joke let a lone an excuse of italian food. Italian American are about making people enjoy their food and culture, Instead this guy is selling his products way beyond market value. How are we supposed to keep heritage culture and food alive if places are going to sell items like this so expensive. I am better of ordering a shipment from Italy or Chicago and New York where Italian deli's are aplenty.",

We waited 15 minutes for a seat and when the owner finally got up from taking up a table of 4 to sign papers for a car he was buying....... they tried to give the table to one of their good customers.  We bought a bottle of wine and finished it at the restaurant and was charged $5 for a corking fee.  please explain that ......................The owner and I'm guessing  his daughter who was behind the counter was real rude........... When we left I commented on a dish that someone was eating (it looked real good) the patron said you can get one to if you come here often........WOW -I guess I don't look Italian",

Everything I had was awesome. The grilled calamari was really good.  I had the chocolate croissant for dessert.  It was probably the best I've ever had.  And I've had a lot of chocolate croissants.  All their house made desserts looked awesome.   I saw some of the pastas going out and they looked incredible. The restaurant was clean and had a real homey feeling.  I'm part Italian and I felt right at home.  It's hard to find really high quality food these days, but these guys did it.  I like how you walk up and order, and they bring the food to your table. I'm going back very soon to try their house made prosciutto( who does that??) and their delicious looking pasta(gnocchi and rigatoni). If you think this place has bad food, you clearly don't know high quality, healthy, delicious food.  It's pretty clear why this place was rated #2 best Italian cuisine by Phoenix magazine in 2014.",

A few years back my friend who lives in the valley and also lived in Florence found this place. We went . . . and since then it is one of my favorite places to go. AUTHENTIC. Is the only thing you need to know about this place. From the Italian TV on the station - to the staff (speaking Italian across the counter at each other). This place takes me back to Florence. The sandwiches are amazing. And the desserts . . . well they are delicious. To put all this into context this is a place we will drive 45 minutes across town to for lunch.",

My only intent in reviewing Andreoli is to say that I love the food and atmosphere but have been very disappointed in the prices.  It is just not a good value for the money when you can get comparable quality at other Italian groceries in town for much less money.  When I was charged 1.50 per fig for fresh figs from the case last week I decided I had to write the review (I just picked up a dozen large, fresh figs at Costco for $5.99 this evening).  That kind of overcharging is insulting and will lose this grocer money.",

Every night it is something different but you could always order something off the lunch menu.  This is truly exciting because obviously the menu is always going to change....different experiences....  2.  Andreoli/wait staff were extremely pleasant and the mood of the restaurant was very relaxed.  Ask all the questions you want about what is on the menu and even make simple requests to suit your taste.  3.  Restaurant was full of Italians speaking Italian.  Obviously the food has to be good and authentic if it is full of people from that country.  The food was excellent and out of the norm.  I had a monstrous steak with squid ink risotto on the side.  Steak was cooked exactly as ordered and the risotto was extremely creamy/different.  Andreoli even brought out another dish that he wanted us to try just for fun.    I invite other culinary explorers to try this restaurants Italian food.  If you think the Spaghetti company or the Olive Garden is good Italian food then raise the bar and try True Italian food.  Lastly, good place to take a date.....",

    "text": "DeFalcos was the king.  Since I found Andreolis my life has changed.  Fresh baked bread, finest cuts of meats, and hand made pastas.  It does not get any better than this.  I had not tasted good balsamic vinegar and olive oil till I had some at Andreolis (granted a good bottle of olive oil will cost you upwards of $50).    I have been to Andreolis a few different times now and each time I go I have to try something new.  Usually when you go to a place there are one or two good things to eat on the menu.  Not so at Andreolis.  As my fellow foodie Pete likes to say \"it is a check list not a menu\".  I have had sandwiches, salads, bread and meat trays, but the crown jewel is their raviolis.  As an example I ordered their mushroom ravs one day and they were out.  Michael (the owners son) comes out to my table and lets me know but tells me they have taken care of me.  When my plate arrives he lets me know that they made me some pumpkin ravs instead.  My heart drops in my shoes because I hate all things pumpkin.  But, I grin and bare it knowing that everything else I have tried here is top notch.  I take my first bite and a large smile comes over my face.  The ravs were so good I wanted to cry.  Every bite I could taste the hint of truffle oil, the butter that was mixed in, and slight tinge of sage.  The pumpkin filling was so good I wanted to go to my moms house and slap her for making such god awful pumpkin pies growing up and making me think pumpkin was an evil squash.  Andreolis is not some fancy upscale establishment, so if you are looking for cultured you are coming to the wrong place.  What Andreolis is though is a great Italian deli that serves great food using fresh imported Italian ingredients.  If you are in Scottsdale stop by and order the ravs.  Your stomach and palette will thank you.",

Soccer on the TV, people talking Italian, family recipes, remarkable baked goods and pastries, meats, cheeses, salad dressing.  I seriously have not been disappointed with anything on the menu.

The real downfall of this place is the disgustingly rude owner and his daughter, who clearly haven't been educated in proper common courtesy towards their customers and employees. I decided for this reason to make a yelp account and would like to share just one example of the last time I went:  A law school buddy of mine and I went about a month ago and he asked for some tiramisu from the front. The man working there scooped a generous amount up, put it on a plate, and brought it to the register where the owner's likely mentally unstable and/or deficient daughter proceeds to use expletives as she slaps half of the tiramisu off the plate and throws it out, just as my friend had his credit card out and about to pay for it! Furthermore, she proceeds to berate and harass the worker in front of the entire restaurant for giving my friend \"too much\" tiramisu. This made for an equally awkward and terrifying situation for everyone in the establishment.   The rest of the waitstaff are semi-friendly, but it doesn't offset the negative attitude and atmosphere exuding from the owner and his family. I have been here many times and at this point, am done with the overall rudeness. There are plenty of better Italian restaurants out there that don't have mediocre food and a family of psychos running it.",

    "text": "Comment from Linda S. of Andreoli Italian Grocer  Business Owner 4/6/2017  We're sorry your experience at Andreoli was not what you expected. You had three of our popular sandwiches, each under $10. We must disagree with you that our sandwiches are flavorless - in fact, each component is made in house or imported directly from Italy. We are meticulous about the quality of ingredients and we are committed to going the extra mile to deliver the extraordinary for our customers; we encourage diners who are not as concerned with that level of attention to detail to go elsewhere.  Thank you we will. Being from San Candido Italy and having gone to culinary school in Florence as well cooking in Italy and other European countries I will seek authentically good italian food other places. Ciao",

Some of the main courses are somewhat expensive however the sandwiches and salads are reasonably priced and feeling if you don't want to go the route of the meal.  The bresaola is the best i have had since Chicago. I really would give it five stars except for the fact that the calamari is better elsewhere and they didn't have any kind of sauce or marinara . The home made Italian sausage was really good but could have used some Italian peppers and onions to make it perfect. So I would give this place four and a half Stars especially for the money. We had calamari a feeling sandwich and the meat platter two beers age and the tab was around $40.",

We love authentic Italian and have a place in Scottsdale I have been going to for 45 years which was also on Triple D.  We came up from Chandler and were so hungry! Love the different tables and chairs with a real Italian feel and decorations. There was a table full of what looked like family members and chefs/employees, near the register and it confused us as to where we order. The young man at the counter was super helpful and we ordered 3 sandwiches and the fries with leeks. Total bill for 3 people for lunch was $36. OK, I guess. The place was nearly empty but we waited quite a bit for our food. I had the salami, cheese and olive sandwich which was small with a small sliver of cheese, and 4 circles of salami. The rolls were delicious but I would think you could get a little more meat and cheese than that. The quality is excellent without question but it just wasn't anything I would come back to if we weren't in the area. It felt like we were outsiders and not very welcome. The fries with fried leek were outstanding! This is the only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 2. We will go back to our favorite place in Scottsdale but wish Andreoli's well.",

It is fresh and homemade (not processed), some of the ingredients are imported (imported for a reason--they are authentic and amazing) and the flavors are marvelous.  I recently discovered that the person who runs this restaurant mentored the guy who runs Pizzerio Bianco (also excellent)! That makes a lot of sense.  I am gluten free, so they make an eggplant sandwich without the bread for me and it's fantastic!  The wine is also very nice.  The atmosphere is casual, friendly and unpretentious.  I almost didn't write the review in fear of having it become too crowded as everyone's favorite Italian place!",

Andreoli is about as authentic, original, and delightfully delicious as anything in town, or for that matter, around the country. Giovani, the owner feels the same way if you ask him. Branzino, rigatoni with sausage, and artisanal bread that is beyond compare. One more thing, it's rustic in ambience and you need to go to the counter  (ordering not serving which is at the table). We find this charmimg, and those who don't, well, that's just fine by us...",

I recently started buying their bread - perhaps the best in the valley, and on a par with Acme Bakery in the Bay Area.   To those who said this place is not 'authentic' ... I was there during the World Cup (soccer) in 2012 when Italy happened to be playing, and the place was full of Italian-flag-draped young men, all cheering and shouting in Italian.  The owners were out in force too!   My g/f loves the 'trippa' (tripe), a seasonal special they do.  I also love the way you help yourself to beers - you just walk up to the cooler and take what you want, and pay at the end. Very homey!",

    "text": "Interesting......so many of the reviews below talk about attitude. A couple of thoughts on that. First, i have been there several times and they have been nothing but friendly, genuine and sincere. Do they sound a bit rough due to ESL and cultural tone? Sure. If you don't like that type of tone go to the Olive Garden where you won't run into a single True Italian. Second thought is, what did you do to piss them off? I think the tone and attitude in this market is exactly what I expect from a True Italian market. I have been to Italy 6 times and this is genuine Italian. You fellow patrons will likely be speaking Italian.  The food is incredible. I am not a big fan of eggplant. my wife asked me to try her eggplant sandwich and it was the best eggplant I have ever had. I will probably order that next time I am in. I had the Porchetta (Pork Sandwich) and the pork was perfectly cooked and the bread is fresh. The Maningota is what we really go here for. Make sure you save room for dessert!  THe groceries that they offer are very limited, but they are everything you would need for an authentic Italian meal. They are also ingredients that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.",

The prosciutto, made in house, was salty and creamy. The Black Pepper salami had a perfect balance of spice. The Capacolla was very flavorful. However, the portion was extremely small for $9.95. We had 3 slices each of meat, 3 tiny pieces of cheese, and 3 olives.  Next we ordered the Tizio, Italian sausage and pepper sandwich. The bread is perfectly chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  It had great flavor. The side salad was also good, house greens with a citrusy white balsamic. The sandwich ($8.95) itself was a disappointment. We requested a slice of provolone cheese be added to our sandwich. The server, while polite, informed us that there could be no additions to the sandwich as the owner was a purist when it came to the food. Our sausage (patty) was over charred which left only bitter grill taste in your mouth. The sandwich was very dry, containing very few peppers and a heap of onions.  Though we usually are fans of Triple D restaurants, Andreoli's was overall a disappointment.",

I have been coming here long before their infamous debut on diners drive in's and dives, I also reluctantly admit that I was apprehensive to yelp about this place because I was scared that once the secret got out so would my dear beloved Andreoli's.   Thankfully, even with the major notoriety this place has received over the last year or so, not a thing has changed about this place other than the size of the restaurant and the Guy Fieri poster plastered on the door as you walk in.   The Patriarch aka Chef Giovanni still consistently serves up some of the best Italian food in town. A must if your on this side of town!",

We had the arugula and burrata salad, Italian fries, branzino, grilled calamari, and for dessert tiramisu and decaf cappuccinos.  Everything was literally <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyum.com&s=1c9102c32c410e468226058fddd128acd46c8298c4d00d6bac7d25aa761c34d2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">yum.com</a>. The salad was fresh and creamy, the branzino cooked to perfection and yummy, the calamari is seasoned really nicely. The tiramisu is just the right amount of creamy and the Capuccino was delicious. You have to try the Italian fries. They come with this amazing dipping sauce.  No reservations here. You order at the counter, sit with your number, and they serve you. When you are done you take your number to the register and pay.   The service is excellent. You can also shop some authentic Italian items and take the meats, pastas, and desserts home.  When in scottsdale visit this gem!",

But the main star, the food, seemed just okay. Our pizza, though very crispened on the bottom, had its cheese and toppings slip and sliding atop the marinara, and the squid, while having proper flavour, was overdone. I'd rather base my model of authentic-italian-in-arizona off of a different restaurant.",

They have a great variety of meats and cheese, olive's and salads.  I've only had the cheese cake but everything they have looks to good to eat.  I can't wait till they have the seasonal dish I saw on TV. A roast type of meat with potato and broth served like a soup during the cold months.

Being from Europe and frequent Italy travelers we were craving a place like Andreoli. The top-notch Italian food, the people and the casual atmosphere can't be more authentic! You immediately feel it's Italian family owned by the warmth, the pride they justly take, and that they're all personally invested and really deeply care. You'll see it reflected in everything, from the recipes to the service to the decor. Everything is made fresh in-house, from the pastries, prosciutto, and mozzarella to the pasta and pizza. And so many things are imported directly from Italy! Chef Giovanni goes the extra mile in entertaining his guests and having us taste the things he doesn't want us to miss out on. We highly recommend Andreoli!",

    "text": "When I found out Andreoli was made famous by Guy Fieri, I had to check it out.  I find pure joy in verifying his claims.  Not every joint he claims to fame is a home run.  But in this case, I can confidently say it was a buzzard beater winner, chicken dinner.    Instead of trying to remember every single dish we had I will just say, everything was fantastico!  Upon ordering, the gentleman behind the counter kindly recommended to us to get something with seafood and sure enough it was spot on good.  The squid, clams, shrimp, and scallops were cooked perfectly.  Not rubbery at all.  Each came in some kind of pasta--risotto or spaghetti.  All prepared in classic al dente in fused with light, hearty flavor that reminds you of grandma's cooking.  I saved the best for last which is their carpaccio cold salad.  The presentation provoked salivation which then led us to beefgasm to the Nth degree.  The thinly sliced almost raw beef just melted in your mouth accompanied by the fresh salad and thin, transparent cheese.    I partially lied about confirming on Guy Fieri's claim since none of these were what he actually ate but I am basically trusting his word as first impression on the mentioned foods were memorable and outstanding.  The reason why we couldn't try the foods he had was because one of them was out of season while the other was recommended as a lunch item.  Not much else to say except to come check them out.  The wallet might take a big hit, but you will gain a much deeper respect for Italian cuisine.",

Andreoli's has a nice selection of meats, desserts and other tasty looking treats for sale in their store and a variety filled menu full of Italian dishes.  Although they have a large variety of sandwiches, salads, and antipasto dishes, I was in the mood for pasta. I ordered penne pasta with sausage and peas. I've never had peas as part of a pasta dish, but the addition was a pleasant surprise. The sausage based sauce was tasty and had no shortage of meat. I'm not sure if the pasta was homemade, but it had a very high quality taste to it.  Above average food, friendly service, and a great ambience gives Andreoli's a well deserved five stars.",

Service is good...although it's walk up and order even at night. They do bring you your meal and the bread is fresh. Good place to take visitors and they also have a small market.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been here many times and drive over 40 minutes just to eat and shop here for some delicious Italian items. I've never had an issue with something tasting delicious .....one problem I do have is the pricing is high. Ok, we could and have dealt with that ( and have) to enjoy getting delicious burratta, prosciutto, etc.... The bigger problem is the rude attitude you get in this establishment. Every time we visit we not only eat, but purchase 80-100$ in food to take home (which doesn't get you much) and the staff acts like you are burdening them to slice meat or cheese, scoop burratta, or box a pizza. We have tried different tactics like calling ahead to order so as not to \"bother\" them during a busier time, or coming when the doors first open so it's not a busy time......I have never felt like I needed to apologize to a business owner or their staff for trying to spend money at their establishment before!!!!! And you know what??? Bad on us for continuing to do it for the past several years....3 or 4 times each year. No more!!!! My husband is Italian and loves to cook and eat and use products that remind him of his father's restaurant (out of state) and his nonna's cooking. Let me tell you, my husband's family came straight from Italy in the 50's and 60's and he is first generation born in the US. His father runs his restaurant like you are a guest in his own home. Warm, friendly and very appreciative of his customers. I am not the kind of person who has to be treated extra special to make an experience good, but Andreoli's always makes me feel like I've added to their already bad day when I've been there. Don't worry guys, it won't happen again.",

The calamari is marinated and tasty and has a distinct flavor that makes an individual come back for more and more and more.  One can taste vinegar with some olive oil and pepper and some spice I can't quite put a finger on.  Try their potato fries, it is so unique and crispy and served with crispy onion strips!  House salad is most tasty with just the right amount of oil and vinegar.  Pasta is of course al dente and cooked to perfection!  Place is small, plan to come before 7pm, otherwise, a takeout is always the best option.  Oh, forgot to mention the desserts, I don't know what they're called or what's in them but just try them, you won't regret it!!!  Belissimo!!!",

Many of the prices seem a bit high for the quality you receive.  Rigatoni was indeed hard and undercooked.  (Yes, I too know al dente)  We also got the Roast beef sandwich with carmalized onions which had absolutely no flavor,  If you are not including any condiment or gravy on the sandwich the beef should at least be seasoned and have some flavor.  It was tender though, just flavorless.  The bread is good however.  Very old school.  Another observation was that the owner was very present and available but never attempted to make the rounds to see if folks were happy.  In an intimate place like this that would be a no brainer to me.  Another one bites the dust!",

Mostly the skin of the eggplant is on the sandwich. There's hardly any sauce on the sandwich & it only has a small amount of mozzarella. It comes out warm not hot. The only good part of this sandwich is the bread.  One girl that we interacted with was very rude also. She seemed to be very friendly with the people she knew & not nice to others.

He realized it was veal sauce and offered to pay for it and again were told its not available. The gentleman and lady who set next to us were the owners.  Very rude, arrogant and obnoxious.

The flavors arouse your palate the same way an adult film does for a 14 year old. Yeah. Just like that.   After meeting up with Yelpers last night at the International Supper Club, I was informed that I work very close to Andreoli, so I decided to place a quick to-go order today. Went online, and saw the most catchy name possible....The Bastardo.   Ok, it wasn't just the name. It was the olive tapenade, the pecorino, the genova salami and the side salad. It all sounded so perfect. And it was. It was everything as I had described in the second paragraph.  Freaking amazing.  As soon as I arrived (within 10 minutes), my sandwich was ready. Everything was perfect. I am in food heaven. I am coming back to order my cured meats.  Everything is a touch pricier than normal, but service is FAST. and MUCH faster than DeFalco's. I still LOVE DeFalco's....but this is closer to my work....and the speed of service makes me a very, happy man.",

Do expect a fabulous assortment of pastries, sandwiches and pasta dishes. Nice selection of wines and beers in a venue that has the feel of a corner shop in Italy. My wife had the homemade sausage sandwich and I had the \"Bastardo.\" We are going back next week to continue our new quest of trying everything Andreoli has to offer.  Expect to hear a lot of locals speaking Italian but we got by very well using English:)  A little pricey but no where near the cost of a trip to the \"boot.\"",

My daughter loves her Nona's pasta and an authentic italian meal so we decided to give this place a try. Our kids had spaghettini in a plain tomato sauce. My husband and I split the bresaola and arugula salad with Parmesan and a plate of pasta with veal sausage. The meal was delicious. Very authentic and flavourful. The sandwiches that we saw others eating alos looked very good - on fresh ciabatta bread. It reminded us of meals we eat in Italy or at my italian in-laws' place.   We also had dessert. The pastries and espresso are excellent.   We ate around 2pm on a Friday and the place wasn't too crowded. The owner was socializing with patrons and thee was a friendly vibe.   The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the prices for the pasta (over $20) seem high for an establishment where you order at a counter.   Decor is quaint and traditional with antique style table and chairs. It has a very family-run type feel which is nice.",

    "text": "My son's office is only 5mns drive from this place and he invited me today for lunch. I am from France and I love Italy, speak Italian and enjoy the Italian food in general. I have lived 36 years in the States and to find authentic Italian cooking in the SouthWest can sometimes be a challenge.   I was happy to find out that Andreoli had carpaccio as it is my favorite and it was so delicious.  I was so glad to taste a carpaccio without heavy olive oil nor capers on it! The shaved parmesan cheese on top is all what you need to enhance the carpaccio of beef. There is a nice light salad under the meat and it is exactly like you get in Italy or France, no tomatoes, nor cucumbers or other veggies like in American salads. It is simple, light with just a drizzle of oil and vinegar but oh so good! For dessert I had the tiramisu cake and it was the best I ever had even in Italy! It melts in the mouth. My son had the Zuppa cake which also was fantastic. His pork sandwich was amazingly tasty. I got a Sicilian pastry to go and I couldn't resist but eat it at home, wow! Great taste, not too sweet, crunchy outside and smooth inside with a cheese, lemon paste.  My son had already tried the pasta dishes and said they were fantastic. So although Andreoli is a bit far from where I live in the Valley I will make multiple trips to try more dishes in the future, this being my first time.   To answer some unfair other reviews, as far as the price goes it is NOT expensive for fresh and truly tasty food, I believe that it would be more expensive in a large Italian city for similar dishes! To get that type of food I'd rather go without any trip to Starbucks or another medium of the range restaurant that in my opinion are overpriced no matter what you get because in general the food is so Americanized (bland or chemically enhanced)! My apologies (not) to all the US fast food or chain restaurants that litter the Valley of the Sun!   The service was fast and very friendly, I can't understand how some reviewers said they had to wait a long time! It must have been a particularly busy time or someone exaggerating!  I realize that the food served there is very Italian and the portions are just like in Italy not more not less, so don't expect any American humongous portions, yet to me it's just right and the food is fresh, no chemicals nor coloring added to enhance the flavors like so many American restaurants, especially fast food! When you eat at Andreoli's you don't feel overstuffed, it's so digestible. VIVA ITALIA!   Molte grazie Giovanni for a wonderful experience and the decor is also very Italian! It's exciting to find such a place! Arivederci!",

The quality of ingredients is top notch.  They do not cut corners here and you can taste it.  I thought the portion size was right on point and the price was in line with the portion size.  I'm not sure why a few yelpers have complained about size and price but I guess we all have different expectations.  I have also had the eggplant sandwich and it is wonderful!  I eat 1/2 for lunch and the other 1/2 for dinner.  It's very flavorful and very filling. As for the sempronio, I never leave 1/2 for dinner, not because it's small, but because it is so darned good...I can't stop eating it until it's all gone.  I've never had their pastas or dinner meals but I plan to.  Keep up the great food Andreoli's :-)",

We had never been there so it was nice to find a cute Italian grocer with decent food. I say decent I guess because I was thinking the food would be more flavorful.  We ordered two sandwiches. I thought I was ordering a tuna sandwich but I basically got a Caprese. Pretty standard, except that the bread was soooo good and buttery. My mom said her sandwich lacked flavor but the bread was good as well.   It really was the bread that was impressive for both of us.  It seems as though they have really good food here aside from sandwiches. It's a bit pricey though.   What made the experience nice was one of the workers who had the greatest personality. He was humble and spoke mostly Italian but a little English.   The young lady at the counter was not friendly, but it was this guy who spoke mostly Italian who asked us if it was our first time and made some dessert recommendations. Another worker made some sandwich recommendations. If it wasn't for these two men, I would've felt completely isolated and unwelcome in this establishment, so I'm really glad they were there to be helpful, even though it's not their primary job.  I get it's your family's restaurant, but if you don't want to be there, don't be there. People can tell and this restaurant could be even greater with better service.",

We ordered the lobster pasta thinking it was a good deal ($16) and turned out it was $32 for only half a lobster! The grilled calamari is amazing, nice grilled flavor with olive oil and not chewy at all. The sandwiches are really good too. My husband like the pasta with sausage sauce.   We also like the dessert they serve. The chocolate croissant is very good and they sell out fast so grab it if you see one at dinner time. Gets crowded on weekends for dinner. Small place with limited seating so not good for large group.",

Great food and a very authentic \"Italian\" feel. Mamma Mia!",

We waited half hour and I got two undercooked unpeeled shrimp , few small pieces of cold fish with no taste to it , few pieces of looked like previously frozen potatoes and small pieces of broccoli. And it's for $34 ??? Common ! I could have gone to Ocean Club for this price and have an amazing meal there . My friend ordered pasta with veal sauce and it was horrible , tasted like one of the frozen meals at the grocery store in a frozen section , actually I think frozen section tastes better , and the price was matching to the hi end Italian restaurants. And it was cold too . Calamari is the worst dish I've ever had . 4 pieces of oily no flavor calamari socked in oil . This place should stick with servicing sandwiches not entrees they can't even cook and they serve if for the price of hi end restaurants . Guido's deli is 1000 times better !!! I will never come back to this place again . Yuck !!!!",

    "text": "I've seen some mixed reviews for Andreoli's.  Let me set you straight: this is an authentic, family-owned place.  If you come somewhat regularly (you should!), you will recognize the same people each time.  Some of the younger employees seem to have a little bit of an attitude, but most of the staff are very attentive and authentic and truly want you to have a great experience.  There is brick-oven pizza on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  I've had this on two separate occasions and had quite different experiences.  The first time it was great, the second time the crust was a bit soggy.  I think they were simply busy and didn't leave it in long enough.    What I keep coming back for are the sandwiches.  They are amazing and also have great vegetarian options.  I highly recommend the eggplant sandwich, even if you typically eat meat.  Its great!  The calamari (both the friend and grilled) are also great if you eat fish!    They have several different beer and bottles of wine you can purchase, or you can choose a glass of the house wine.  Come early if you don't want to wait.  Otherwise, come for lunch!  Always order coffee and dessert -its definitely worth it!",

They decide to strip the eggplant down to the skins and then put all the skins in the sandwich. Next, they take all the seedings and eggplant meat and also throw that into this sandwich disaster. Top it off with mozzarella cheese and charge you $9 for the privledge of eating a horrible concoction. Nothing is fried, nothing is mentioned how they would be spitting on the fine history of the egplant parm sandwich in their version. Wilted lettuce as your side dish and there you go - enjoy your lousy lunch. Ripoff city. Should have walked out when they said that they don't have a chicken parmesan sandwich...hello it's an Italian joint. Whatever part of Italy this place represents, avoid it on vacation.",

They still won't add or subtract condiments or cheese.  I don't know how they stay open.  I really wish they would read these reviews & understand they are not well received by the company I work for, which has about 200 employees at our office.  As I said before, word travels fast & people have a bad taste in their mouth from Andreoli's.  It's the same story over & over.  These folks are real jerks.",

The sandwiches and desserts are great... and the side salad that they serve with the sandwiches is so fresh with a light and simple oil and vinegar dressing.  Yes, most of the employees at Andreoli's have an Italian accent, and YES, this means that sometimes their personalities are lost in translation... but I personally love it!  The ingredients are always so fresh, and I recommend the Sempronio sandwich, especially if you are a fan of prosciutto.  I did not give the place 5 stars for three reasons:  1. it's a little expensive.  2.  Not a lot of parking.  3.  Not a lot of seating-- it gets crowded quickly.  So if you are going for lunch, make sure you are there by about 11:30.  Also, I have to add that I have been to Andreoli's at night before, and there was an opera singer... which was super cool!  **Slight amendment to original review.** I wish I could give 3.5 stars for this place.  I just got lunch there and was charged SEVEN DOLLARS for one slice of cake.  And the portion wasn't large, and the cake is dry and not very good.  Also, my friend bought some of their gourmet chocolate, and it's *ridiculously* expensive.",

My mom and dad got a pork sandwich that looked really good, I tried some of it, and it was exceptional! For dessert we had a chocolate cake. Once the first person tried a bite, they went in for seconds. This is definitely a great place to go for dinner before an event. Me and my family went here before we drove to an art show and we didn't get hungry again. The place has old timey decorations and shelves. You have to try this Italian restaurant!",

He makes his own prosciutto there and it was absolutely amazing! The platter was full of 3 different cuts of meat, cheese, olives, plenty of bread, and dipping oil.

OMG it is by far the best pizza we have ever had. The crest was light and airy,  the mozzarella cheese was so fresh, And the sauce, amazing, so fresh with the ripe tomatoes. I love the vibe of this place. If you know the family and speak Italian, you get to sit at the good table. Most of the time is has a reserved sign holding it for the someone special.  But back to the food. You have to try the Italian French fries, AMAZING!! And the #25 salad, simple but tastes like nothing I have ever had. It's basically mixed greens, fresh tomatoes, and a remarkable oil and vinegar dressing. I asked for shaved parmesan cheese to be added. Try it and you will see why.  I wish they would sell the salad dressing pre mixed and bottled!! They would make a killing.  The gnocchi is the best I have ever had, including restaurants in New York and San Francisco. Who knew the best Italian restaurant in the US would be here in Scottsdale, Arizona!!   Love this place, you must try it!!",

Decided to go with the prosciutto and mozzarella with no peppers (since I wasn't eating it until later and didn't want them to make the sandwich soggy.)  The guy at the register was super nice. Said it would be a few minutes because they were just taking the baguettes out of the oven (who can be mad at THAT??). About 5-7 minutes later, they brought my sandwich out.   I didn't eat it until about two hours later when I was on the plane but WOW. The baguette was perfect. Slightly crispy on the outside but super moist with just the right density. The prosciutto was really great with wonderful saltiness. The mozzarella was perfect too.   All of it added up to one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in a long time. Guy Fieri was right on this one. Go to this place and get you a sammie...  now!",

    "text": "Stopped in for some post golf feasting last week while in town. What a great place! Feels like a combination deli and comfy home dining room. Tons of personality working there. Had a mozz, prosciutto and roasted pepper sandwich...to start. Great bread, super flavorful prosciutto, melt in your mouth mozz. Served w a side salad (I added tomatoes) ...delish!  Washed that down with a Moretti Lager.  Then, had to do it....asked if they would make me a half order of the pasta w/ broccoli and Italian sausage (recommended by a co-worker). They obliged the half order, and thus, enjoyed maybe the best version of this dish I've ever had.  Great Orecchiette shaped pasta with perfectly cooked broccoli, crumbles of Italian Sausage, olive oil, garlic and a heaping \"dusting\" of grated parm. Absolutely fabulous. Of course, another Moretti to wash it down. Thanks guys! Will be back next time in town for sure.",

They will verbally abuse your toddler if your toddler decides to do the unthinkable ( sarcasm)  of touching the showcase glass or anything in there! Many parents at the international school of Arizona nearby that used to go there to have a bite waiting for their kids to get off school had horrible experiences as well, we will be writing a notice on the corkboard of the school administration warning our parents; many of them are foreign nationals that are just baffled by the grotesque treatments and the verbal abuse & the rudeness!!!   OF COURSE Linda's response at Andreoli's is that they wanted to protect the 2 three year olds touching the glass    (yes I said 3 year olds that these owners with a lack of patience and social intelligence expected to act like adults)  , but there are other ways to notify the 2 mom in a a civilized manner without screaming at them in a vile barrage of insults in Italian and letting them leave in tears with traumatized and scared three-year-olds.  My wife has audio of the incidents in more details will be posted on my Facebook page! We will talk to everyone in our community about the experience, specially parents that will be mortified to have some unprofessional bitter socially unpleasant person screaming at their toddlers!!

The glass cases in front of the shop house an amazing selection of aged/dried meats and cheeses, pastries and chocolate. The menu consists of sandwiches, salads, and specials (mostly soups and pasta dishes). I believe I remember the owner mentioning something about pizza on a certain day of the week.   This place is always packed at lunchtime, so come early and grab a table. There is a patio to use if it's nice outside. The \"market\" part is small, but it seems like the goods are pretty fancy.   The service is fast and accommodating. They won't kiss your ass, but they get the job done! The interior is dim and resembles what I would say is a traditional old country kitchen. Very rustic. You won't be disappointed!",

She replied with \"no, we don't mix meats\".  Really?  Pretty sure I'm the customer and if you're not willing to give me what I want, I won't be back.  Hence, I'm never going back.  The sandwich would have been much better if they made it the way I requested it.  An Italian sandwich with just one meat?!?  It was bland.  Bread was hard and flavorless.  My friend loves Italian food and he got the Rigatoni Bolognese, which he thought was OK but nothing special.  DeFalco's is better, especially for sandwiches.  Oh, and do not order the tripe, I think the reason is self explanatory.",

But the sandwich did not taste too good once I arrived home as it was not hot any longer and I needed to doctor it up to so it tasted better - so added some red onions and goat cheese plopped it in the toaster oven for a few minutes and wowla a great tasting sandwich.  I did love the bread and someone said they make their bread from scratch.  I hope this is True. Pretty good place for sandwiches if you eat in, take out not so much.

    "text": "It was a Monday and there's nothing too great about Mondays. It was lunchtime and it was hot outside. I didn't bring my lunch into work so I had to go somewhere. I sat and pondered about where to go. I started driving and kept driving and it then hit me...I'd been wanting to try Andreoli for years and this Monday lunchtime was going to be the day! Would it be everything I dreamed of? Would I silently thank the owners for making me happy on this hot and miserable Monday? Would it feel like I stepped into Italy in the desert? Would I gorge not one both both halves of my sandwich? Would I leave with chocolate in my hand? The answer to each question above is yes; a thousand times yes!   I parked my car and walked through a game of two patrons playing Foosball. It felt very much like Italy and it felt even more like Italy once I stepped through the doors. The grocer is open in the middle with plenty of homey tables and chairs and different types of Italian groceries line the walls. I immediately noticed the tasty dishes in the glass refrigerator at the counter and most importantly, the rows of desserts tempting my taste buds.   The menu is lengthy and everything sounded delicious. From pasta to sandwiches, this Italian grocer has it all. Experiencing my typical menu anxiety, I stared anxiously at the menu and finally, asked the man behind the counter what he suggested. He said to go for the # 3 named the sempronio which had prosciutto, mozzarella and pepper sandwich on sourdough. It sounded delicious so I said \"sold!\" and moved my way to the cash register. Before I could escape though, chocolate caught my eye. Yes, I was coming off of an eating binge in Chicago but I couldn't resist so I asked for a little slice of the chocolate with marzipan in the middle.   I lunched alone and I felt just fine doing so here. Everyone is very friendly and everything is very casual, so I sat at my table and waited for my meal to arrive.   And now let me tell you about the Italian goodness known as my sandwich. The sourdough bread was soft, crunchy and blissful with every bite. I read in one of the reviews that the prosciutto was so good it was almost a sin to eat it with bread. That is exactly how this prosciutto was. It was salty and moist and very lean. Absolutely delicious with every bite. The peppers complimented it perfectly and I didn't even mind the biteful of garlic clove I discovered. I asked for a to-go box. I did, and I had every intention of wrapping up half of the sandwich and saving it for later. But how could I do so to something so delicious? So, the other half stayed in the to-go box all of five minutes before I consumed the remainder. I was full and satisfied.   Here's a very important note: do not ask to change anything on the menu. What they offer is what you get and not only is it delicious as-is and shouldn't be changed, they will also refuse you if you request any substitutes. Hey, it's the Italian way and as a fellow Italian, I can honestly say: that's how we role!  I cannot wait to visit again and again. I also can't wait to buy products from their and have an Italian feast of my own at home!",

    "text": "We live in the SF Bay Area & come to Scottsdale 1-2 times per year to see my wife's family. I checked online (Yelp & Trip Advisor) & found the positive reviews and 4 1/2 stars for Italian restaurants & with Andreoli I liked the menu and the fact that the owner & cook are native born Italians. I'm not but my heart and soul are very Italian as my parents are born in Italy where we go every year, food a main reason and it is no place for a diet. Many places in North Beach ( Little Italy in SF), and in Italy too in Piazza Navona, Pantheon etc., have barkers outside enticing people to come in while you prefer some space looking at the outside menu. These are mostly tourists whom many they'll see only once. I hate the hounding. This is a neighborhood place off the busy streets and not a major tourist area like Old Town Scottsdale and is mostly a destination point restaurant and I would guess that most of their customers are repeat so for customers to return, the food has to be good !  So many Italian restaurants have Latins as cooks and these are trained by Italians but for me I'm a bit biased and find that an authentic native born Italian in the kitchen will make me feel more like I'm in Italia and Luciano most certainly did cooking our meals on 2 visits. If they have the ingredients, and they do have so many and imported from Italy too, they'll make something to order. Had Linguini & Clams but it was in a white sauce with a little white wine and olive oil and I asked for it in red but light so Luciano cut up 4-5 cherry tomatoes. On another day I had a taste for Pasta alla Puttanesca, a specialty plate of the Ladies of the Night. I looked in the case and saw Anchovies, Olives and Capers so Luciano made it for me again with the sliced Cherry tomatoes, garlic & olive oil. The Spaghetti was cooked to order and \"al dente\", chewy to the taste. Some restaurants overcook the pasta and it comes like Polenta, Italian cornmeal. In Italy there is an expression \" Fare La Scarpetta\" (little shoe). The bread is used to scoop up the sauce and we were doing that frantically. Many in Italia consider \"La Scarpetta\" the best part of the meal.  My father was born in Cetraro, Italia, and I delighted in having the Cetrarese salad from that region without greens but mixed olives, tomatoes and onions. I saw another salad my Mother used to make with tomatoes, tuna and mixed greens but my Mama would served it with Cannellini beans & no lettuce which I will ask them to do next time we are in the area. I asked if they do Pasta & Fagioli and they do so this will be something for which to look forward.  Very luckily, one day a birthday for a teenage boy was being celebrated where he was given a delectable looking \"torta\"(cake). Also, Gianni's grandaughter, Isabella, was there and it was a festive atmosphere of Italian family and friends. I got nostalgic & felt I was with my family. Many Italians even when you meet them for the first time make you feel like family as I'm sure they do with many customers. And continuing the Italian authenticity, the one TV had the RAI channel and what do Italians love as much as good food, SOCCER !!! And while enjoying eachother's company, eyes glanced at the match.  People in this area are lucky and if you can't make a trip to Italy now, come here as you'll feel like you are in Italy. If I lived in the area I'd be here 3-4 times per week. And they have \"un sacco di selezioni di panino\", wonderful assortment of sandwiches, and as I said about the pasta dishes, if they have the ingredients, I'm sure will make them to order. I noticed too a steady line of people taking sandwiches( I'm thinking now of one I wish to have when I return, homemade sausages, peppers & onions...yum, yum !!!) to go which I would too do on a regular basis along with many other \"prelibatezze alimentari\", Italian delicacies. As they say about returning to Sorrento, I can't wait to return to Andreoli's on our next trip to Scottsdale.",

We didn't finish our order yet, and she gave us the number for the cashier, Instead of her asking us as a business person would say... Would you like anything else? Instead we had to say.... \"Wait, we want croissants also\", she then was acting very arrogant and added the rest of it on our order. Later our order turned out to be a mistake, and we felt bad to throw away the food. Another lady came up and talk to us about it, she was nice but she can't do too much about the blond lady's attitude, because she is the owner's daughter.                          One other reminder....  My husband and I stopped there for chocolate croissant and torrone. The torrone was ridiculous expensive.... $ 13.00 for a small piece.  Croissant was good, it was the closest to the way they make it in Italy.",

The spaghetti with clams was also good.  As many have said, we heard about this place from a tv show. While the hospitality here is more straightforward than warm, we didn't have any of the service mishaps I read in other reviews. Recommended.",

My family has been there several times before and knew one of the servers.  So when we asked him for another table, she started cursing \"No! If he gives them another table I am going to be fucking pissed!\" Her EXACT words. And she absolutely used the restroom,  I was waiting outside the door and she was who came out. I used a toilet seat cover for TP and warned the woman after me there was none. I have no reason to lie about something so petty. I was trying to be diplomatic in my review but since you called me a liar,  I am going to call your daughter out for what she is, a rude bitch! Face it, you people are nasty and rude and no matter how good your food is, service is what make people want to come back. But just keep living in your world where your daughter is an angel and does nothing wrong. Dueces!",

    "text": "I feel odd leaving a 2 star review when so many people really love this place.  So ordered 2 entrees- the gnocchi in a vodka cream sauce and the penne with veal ragu.  So I'm wondering what went wrong here....the gnocchi was just plain tasting, no pizzaz to the sauce, no hint of any real flavors except tomato sauce that seemed watered down.  It was good but for $16 or $17 dollars I sort of expected above average.  Now the veal penne- pasta was cooked perfectly.  And it stops there....the sauce was not enough to really cover or be spread around all the noodles and again, where was that veal taste with hints or spice, tomatoes etc?  Missing like the gnocchi.  Had to ask for a side of Parmesan since the pasta was lacking even a good sprinkling of cheese.  Bread was slightly cold, not warm so great, can it get more annoying.....  So at that point I thought a homemade piece of tiramisu would do the trick.  Okay at this point I said \"you have to be \"bleeping\" kidding me.\"  I would say it was an order of whipped cream with some lady fingers included.  Literally 65% whipped cream that was actually good, won't take that away from them, but the dessert isn't a moose, it's lady fingers.  Tasted the mascarpone cheese, but no taste of coffee liquor, or anything but mascarpone whipped cream.  So disappointed and even more disappointed it costs over $50.00 (had 2 glasses of wine, in small glasses) what tastes slightly better than the Olive Gardens.    And don't charge $7.00 for whipped cream!!!!",

We spent 1 hour, 15 min. there today having a business meeting during a downtime (2:00-3:15 pm) in the back of the restaurant.  Your business was very slow during this time period, with less than 5 or 6 tables being used at one time.  We ordered 3 beverages and a \"to go\" jarred item, spending $20.   We literally were told we could not have a refill on our beverages unless we ordered food. And, then, the waiter added that we would have to leave if we didn't order any food!   It is understandable if your restaurant was busy, that you would not want guests taking up table space and not eating. But that was not the case at this mid-day time period.    That incident, in addition, to the fact that you blatantly have a reserved sign at the  closest parking spot to the front door marked \"Chef Parking\" shows how much you really care about your customers.  You don't!   Although we were certainly not big spenders today, one of us was a new customer, who had planned to bring her Italian husband to dine there soon.  She will not do so now based on this treatment, and neither will the rest of us. By the way, we have spent many dollars in your restaurant in the past.  If this is the way you want to treat people, live with the consequences!",

    "text": "Andreoli's Grocer is a little expensive but the ambiance alone is worth paying for. The Italian and European groceries - pastas, grains, baked goods, olive oils, wine- and the Italian conversations you hear while sitting at their antique tables and chairs, makes you feel as if you were in Italy.   On the other hand I have mixed reviews on their food. I was disappointed in my cheese and cured meat platter. Their menu claims that their antipasto will \"take your breath away.\" I ordered the il tagliere del maresciallo and it was kinda boring.   I expected the dish to be simple but not poorly crafted. I was expecting a variety of firm and soft Italian cheeses and a variety of smoky, spicy, and salty cured meats but got nothing more than a few flavorful meats, a handful of briny olives, and a glob of mild gorgonzola cheese. It would have been really good with one or two more cheeses.  I also ordered a panino forza Italia that was really good. The panino, English translation for sandwich, had a wonderful paring of proscuitto, gorgonzola, mascarpone, and arugula that was served between a perfectly golden crusted and soft baguette.   I plan on going back to try a couple of other things on their menu. Until then I'm going to give them a three. Ciao!",

It looks like an Italian deli on the inside with soccer playing on a TV in the background (classic). Real Italians preparing and serving your food. The sandwich comes with a romaine salad with house dressing already on it. The dressing paired well with the salad and made for a perfect sized meal.   Will be back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Friend at work dragged me along to this place at lunch. I worked next to Andreoli for a long time and had no idea there was an Italian Grocer so close. First impression on the inside was it's a beautifully appropriate Italian interior. The design gave it the feel of what an actual grocer in Italy would be like. Kind of claustrophobic on the inside but I got over it quickly. Next time, I'd eat outside as the weather was perfect. I placed an order for the Sempronio sandwich. Sat down and took in the atmosphere.  It seemed like a lot of the customers on the inside were actually authentic Italian people. I heard some Italian language being thrown around. If they are showing up here, this place must be good I thought.  2 minutes later, a server came out with our sandwiches. Sandwich looked great with prosciutto, mozzarella and roasted peppers practically melting off the sides of the nicely baked bread. A small salad was included on the plate as well. It was so fresh and it I really loved the flavor. Nice and crunchy. Mozzarella was mouthwatering. We couldn't stay long so I get a box to go from a nice girl who worked there.   Overall, I would recommend Andreoli to others out there who are near the Scottsdale area. My only complaint would be the price as the sandwich was near $9 but I mean for the quality it makes sense but I ask for too much. Also, I apologize to the people there for not pushing in my chair. I hope nobody tripped.",

I was surrounded by wooden antique shelves filled with Italian dry pastas, olive oils and mini jam jars.  The long deli case is filled with all kinds of meats, cheeses and homemade pastries.    The menu (available on website) is comprised of panini, antipasti (calamari, pizzas) and salads.  You order at the deli counter and if you're eating in, they bring the food to you and on real plates.  We ordered one thing from each section:  - bresaola con ruchetta e parmigiano: thin-sliced air-cured beef on an arugula salad and shaved parmesan  $6.50  - panino di tizio: grilled homemade sausage, bell peppers and onions in a toasted baguette  $7.50  - le palle del papa: baked breaded rice balls filled with meat sauce, parmesan and peas  $5.00  - sfogliatelle: shell-shaped multi-layered pastry filled with homemade ricotta  $2.75  The sausage and air-cured beef were delizioso!  The rice ball was the size of a baseball and packed with tasty fillings.  My only complaint was that the arugula salad contained hardly any arugula, but that's not going to stop me from coming back to try the daily pasta specials.   Can't handle the hefty airfare and expensive Euro?  This is the next best thing!  Molto bene!",

    "text": "Family owned and operated Italian eatery & grocer.  Service is top notch.  Food amazing!  We dined outside on the patio surrounded by grapevines and lights. We ordered the caio sandwich and the zia rosina salad.  The baguette is very good, the meat was well seasoned.  The salad was simple and so delicious.  We ate light and indulged in several desserts.  Meringata - amazing - still craving this! Pieces of meringue in whipped cream with nuts - heaven!  The fresh strawberry cake was light and not too sweet, just right so delicious!  Sfogliatelle very light and flaky it had a hint of lemon and lightly powdered sugar.  We were stuffed and we had even shared the sandwich.  We look forward to returning and trying other menu items. Love the glass case with all the delicious baked goods, there are some amazing looking chocolates as well that we need to try next time.  The place was packed with Italians -- a very good sign!",

We tried several items the pasta was great and the Big Beef Sandwich with sauteed onions also good.  The people who work here are very friendly and the service was fantastic.  They played with our girls who loved their bread and pasta and often giggled when the waiter joked with them.  We tried two deserts (dont know what they were) but they were also great.  We will be back soon.",

In fact at 6pm the place was full and no tables available inside....no problem, looked like a few were getting ready to open up. A man was sitting alone at a large table, we had 5 in our party. As a table opened up we asked a staff member if maybe they can ask him, if he was waiting for a large group and if not maybe he can take a smaller table. He moved and we were able to sit soon after arriving. I did notice one staff member seemed very irritated with our seating arrangement. I asked her there was a problem and she proceeded to tell me that it was and she was working on it and we needed to wait. I apologized if anyone was rude in my group (knowing it not to be the case) but she was put off and that was not the intent of the request.  We ordered and sat waiting, noticing that there were many regulars, getting served bread, drinks, all sorts of attention and our group was not. My husband asked twice for bread before it arrived. Maybe I was having \"regular customer envy\". BUT, we were the new guys not really feeling the love to want to become a regular. All that being said. The food is amazing, and our foodie selves will be back. Maybe if we go enough....we can be treated like the cool kids....or at least get bread.",

But thats just a pipe dream and if my doctor ever read this he would have a few other things to suggest.  But really, its so simple and yet so good.  Which is Andreoli in a nut-shell.  An Italian deli at its finest.  The salami was quality.  The bread, a perfect baguette, was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Add arugula and some roasted peppers and I'll tell you what you got there . . . . you got big yum!  Yes, its a bit pricey, but the sandwich did come a side salad of fresh romaine and other assorted lettuces tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette with fresh cracked pepper.  A surprise I very much enjoyed.  And frankly, I know where to get a cheap meal but I will happily pay for quality any and every day.  I'm not sure I'll ever be on this side of town again, but if I am, I will keep this place in mind.",

As it is a grocery store, visitors should not expect table cloths or good service,   Many of the unusual items it carries can be found for less at nearby AJs, but not the broad selection of cheeses or salumi.  The homemade hot lunches can be very good, but this is not the place to bring the boss.  Because the food is homemade, it varies in consistency from day to day.  I will say, as one who lived in Italy for many years, the dishes are indeed authentic and worth a try, if not worth the price.  One warning: Don't order the pizza and expect an ordinary pizza.  It's a rustic pizza, made with bread dough.  We did not like it.  Andreoli himself, incidentally, can be quite grumpy to those he does not know.",

However when we got there nobody wanted to help us with anything. The poor guy had to go and ask for a server. The guy behind the counter looked irritated that we had to peruse the menu on the wall behind him and taking too long apparently. Then my wife's uncle wanted to order an appetizer so once again he had to get up and get someone's attention as apparently we were invisible that day. So we are eating the appetizer and the girl comes by and asks if we are still eating it, to which we replied that we were. So we finish the food and wait and wait and wait. So he has to flag her down and ask about our food to which she says oh it's because you were still eating your appetizer so we waited. I get the concept, however we had been finished with the appetizer for 15-20 minutes and the food had been ready the majority of that time. We figure she would have paid more attention so we could get our food and get out of there since it was apparent we weren't favored customers. I asked for a refill on the tea.....should have known better by that time. Stupid me. Needless to say I did not get a refill lol! I had already overstayed my welcome lol! Terrible service the waitress was awful and did not want to communicate to us so it was an awful experience. The only good thing about my experience was that I had a good view of the tv while we waited and waited for our damn food. The food? It was ok. Not worth the bad service though. At least we had a good conversation while we were being ignored though. Guy Fieri got this one wrong, then again they aren't stupid enough to treat him like a regular lowlife customer.",

I actually went here on my search for a decent european pastry in the food desolation that is Scottsdale (on the recommendation of a Chowhound reviewer).  I found my pastry (admit I have no idea what I ate was called - a beautiful croissant but filled with a nutmeg custard (WHAT?!?!?!?!?!)  Omg.  I also got some of their little hazlenut cookies for the office and a slice of dark chocolate covered torrone for my hubby and a sandwhich for lunch.  Now I don't even eat meat but there are so many options here and, honestly, the charcuterie looked beautiful.  I got the buffalo mozzarella and tomato on house made foccacia.  A sandwhich so often abused and maligned by imitators - but this took things back to its farmer-to-table roots.  No heavy dressing, aioli or pesto - just amazing super soft foccacia, perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes and the lightest, fluffiest mozzarella I have ever tasted - a few slices of fresh basil and GENIUS!  I can't wait to take my husband here and, as another reviewer suggested, take advantage of their fresh pastas, olives, cheeses and other items for a home cooked italian meal too.  LOVE Andreoli!  PS I thought the young guy helping me was sweet, if informal - he didn't even make a face at my HUGE order!  Ha ha!!",

So I drove out to Scottsdale, picked it up and drove back to Peoria and put the pasta in the fridge.  Company arrived, sauce was ready so I took the pasta out of the fridge and opened the pkg only to find it was covered in mold.  Was so mad after making the effort to buy fresh.  Had no choice but to then cook pasta from a box.  Now what happened next is what infuriated me.  The next day I drove back to Scottsdale to return the pasta and show them and was told that I must have left it in the hot car or opened it the day before I used it!  I did neither.  The clerk then took it to the back and returned saying the same thing.  So I asked her if she was calling me a liar?  She said no but those were the only 2 things that could have happened.  I asked for my money back and immediately left.  Needless to say I will never return.",

The service is fantastic because it's family run and they really enjoy taking care of their customers and making sure they know they're appreciated (especially if the owners are there). It's quality and customer service that you won't find anywhere else in the area. Also, the interior is really adorable and cozy as its filled with one-of-a-kind odds and ends antique furniture.

Even with all the chaos, it could've been salvaged if the blonde girl at the counter (owner's daughter, I think...) had more manners and customer service skills.  She was rude, curt and had a healthy dose of attitude.  All we wanted were some deli meats, cheeses and olives, but were told \"I'll get these for you but next time don't come at lunch!  What can I get you?\"  Oooookay...so many lessons in customer service here but suffice it to say that you should not greet customers and make them feel unwelcome and as if you are doing them a favor, regardless of what time of day it is.  Also, your operational issues and not your customer's fault.  Remember, I'm just a NEW customer and have no idea when is a \"good time\" to visit your business.  Nor should any customer.  If your doors are open, you're open for business.  We have frequented many Italian grocers both in the USA, Toronto and Vancouver and I can confidently tell you the the Italian cold cuts, cheeses and grocery items like canned San Marzano tomatoes are grossly overpriced.  And, yes, I am comparing the EXACT same products that are imported from Italy.  In addition, the sliced mortadella we received was sliced far too thick and had a dark ring around the outside which indicates it was not fresh.  The sopressata calabrese was good, but, again, way overpriced.      The sfogliatelle were okay (not as light and flaky as I've had from other Italian bakeries) and we enjoyed the chocolate croissants, but we will not go back due to the poor customer service, overpriced grocery and deli items, and just a general atmosphere of chaos and unfriendliness.",

I know folks like to come here for dinner, but for me it's more interesting and manageable during lunch.   Sometimes the TV is tuned to an Italian football game and a group of older men rant and rave at every play.  Other times, it's just the family and employees having fun with each other.  Free entertainment.    Now don't forget to take some cookies for home. They are delicious!  Expect to pay $10 to $15 for a good lunch. No tipping required. Mangia!",

Food served here was so authentic based on my few visits to Italy.  Came here on weekend for late lunch. Order at the counter and they will bring to your table. Nice size dinning area and patio, they were pretty busy at 3pm on weekend afternoon. Not sure why as it wasn't lunch time or dinner time.  Pasta was cooked perfectly, sauce was amazingly well cooked, portion size was a bit smell for US, or it could be I was just hungry, I finished my lunch very quickly and still hungry.  Price was more than what I wanted to pay for lunch. My pasta was $27.  Good homemade desert selection. Cannoli hit the spot, perfect way to end great lunch. They have several more desert available, I wished to try all if not for my weight. Next time I do another hard workout, I want to come back again to try another desert until I get to try all of them eventually.  They sell other food products, I was too tired to walk around that day but would like to come back.",

Met Chef Giovanni 2 days before event to plan the menu. We felt like family right away, everyone welcomed us. It was like walking into his home kitchen and dining room. He was lighthearted and jovial. Promised us a spectacular lunch and did he ever followed through. We started out with arugula salad with burrata with arugula, carpaccio, bresaola, deep fried calamari and grilled calamari and porchetta which was a meal in itself. Then came the main entree of grilled New York steak perfectly med. rare with sides of roasted potatoes/veggies, amazing clam spaghetti olive white wine and fusilli calamari red sauce ( bread to wipe up all the sauce). Giovanni gave us a taste of Italian sashimi which he only serve Saturdays( I don't think it's on the menu). OMG ,fresh halibut, ahi tuna and calamari with creamy garlicky hot sauce. Polish it off with cappuccino, cannolis, pistachio cake, tiramisu ,coconut cake and dark chocolate almond bark. Wish we had enough room to try more desserts. What a way to end a beautiful graduation and Mother's Day weekend. Thanks Giovanni and staff for making our event extra special.",

The beef was basic beef; no Italian flavor to it at all. My hsb joked about where we were going after Andreoli's for a real lunch. The cannoli wasn't filled throughout; only the ends!

That somehow traumatized my tastebuds, and now I shudder at the thought of any sandwich regardless of ratings as I view sandwiches as a source of disgusting evil.  Closed my eyes and bit into my porchetta sandwich, must say that the meats were very well seasoned and fragrant. It was enjoyable and I didn't go crazy.  Other than that, the chocolate croissant was delish, cannoli was just okay.  Andreoli also has some ridiculously cool pottery/hardware shaped chocolates that tasted pretty normal but made my eyes jizz.",

All the breads, pastries, sausage, pancetta and salami are housemade; the cheese are imported from Calbria.   The food is not only fresh, housemade & delicious, portions are extremely generous. I've had veal scallopini pounded so thin and cooked to such perfection that I could cut it with a fork; and the serving was so generous it could easily feed two.     Being from the West Coast, I had reservations about eating seafood in the middle of the desert; but those fears were unfounded as the seafood is flown in fresh daily and lovingly prepared.  The Fettuccine con L'Astice al Pomodoro (Fettucine with Lobster and Tomato) is housemade pasta with fresh, whole lobsters cut in two; the dish is succulent, flavorful and simply outstanding.    The service is warm and inviting, the atmosphere is vibrant and family-friendly.   It's wonderful to be amongst so many Italian patrons and hear Italian spoken amongst the patrons, waitstaff and kitchen -- the ambiance genuinely feels like Italy.",

As many others have commented, the ambiance isn't that inviting, lots of eye rolling and yelling in Italian by the staff which makes people uncomfortable and feel unwelcome. The grocery section is ok, I spotted a jar of Nutella for $11, so, there's that. We had an appetizer (charcuterie was a few types of see-through thin meat, 3 cubes of mozzarella, and 4 olives - good, but no roasted reds, grilled veggies, etc), 2 adult pasta dinners and one kids meal, 3 cookies, just under $100. No salads. My main issue with it is that I'm about 90% certain it's boxed pasta. I can feed my family 2x on a $1 box of pasta. The sauces are good, and we finish every bite (the portions are reasonable, not huge) but it seems excessive to pay so much if it's not fresh pasta. We love to support local and family- owned businesses, but this one is expensive.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited today for the first time (we're on vacation) and we were incredibly impressed!  I'm Italian and from the East Coast and this place did not disappoint.  We ordered the cannoli as an appetizer and it was perfection. Crispy and flaky on the outside and perfect sweetness on the inside. My husband ordered the #1 - sausage, peppers, and onions, and I had the #3 - prosciutto, mozzarella, and roasted peppers. Amazing!! The bread was to die for and the mozzarella was unbelievably creamy. My husband loved his, too. Both came with a side salad - just greens and dressing which is all you need.   Atmosphere is very cozy inside with lots of worn wooden tables to choose from. My only complaint is the portion sizes....because I didn't want the food to end. :)",

The entrees sound amazing and I would really like to try some of them, but can't bring myself to order a $25-$35 entree at a \"deli counter\". If they had table service and if it were more of a restaurant vs. a deli/cafe setting, I would be more inclined to spend the money on the entrees.",

I ordered a sausage sandwich and asked to add provolone cheese (at a charge). They said they do not make to order. Okay, Strike one! What I got was burnt sausage patties on a burnt french roll. The sausage tasted acrid & tough while the bread was hard to bite through. Strike two! The people working there were not friendly and were bickering among themselves. No one greeted you or even cracked a smile and the food was over priced and I felt like I was back in Italy Strike three!  Maybe they were having a bad day...It happens:-(",

    "text": "This food is utterly sublime. It's bursting with flavor and technique, flawless execution, gorgeous presentation.  The food is truly gourmet, in that it's generally light and fresh with decadent touches and reasonable portions (larger than usual for fancy food, smaller than usual for Italian).    I've been here multiple times and ordered various fancy dinner specials (for example, a branzino whole fish - so tender and flavorful!) with phenomenal results.  I lived in Philly most of my life, so I can tell you that this is the real deal Italian.    The desserts are quite delicious, but in my humble opinion, the food is better (certainly for the price).  For lunch, there aren't a ton of vegetarian options, but I've had the caprese salad -  delicious, though a bit small.  So, why not 5 stars?  The prices are high, and the quality of the food definitely supports them, but the atmosphere does not.  Don't get me wrong - there's nothing wrong with the atmosphere.  The place looks like a classic Italian grocery store with some mismatched furniture and a beautiful old espresso machine.  However, I'm a little reluctant to pay $35 per entree when I'm ordering at the counter and sitting in a stiff-backed, funky wooden chair.",

Everyone behind the counter friendly and courteous, even though it was noon and they were very busy. I had a cold sandwich and my partner had a hot sandwich. Both came with a small salad and everything was fantastic - really enjoyed it. It did take about 15 minutes for the sandwiches to arrive, which we found acceptable given how busy they were. This isn't \"fast food\" - obviously hand crafted authentic stuff here.  Afterwards bought a large loaf of bread which was to die for - still warm from the oven. The crust. The chew. Really - wow. We'd eaten a large portion of it in the car on the way home. Also, some Italian olives, kinda pricey but the best I've had.  Going back for sure",

    "text": "Super disappointed on a Saturday afternoon.  We absolutely loved going to Andreoli's and sincerely hope that yesterday was just a off day for a favorite restaurant of ours.  We literally drive 24 miles (one way) to get our Italian fix and we had planned for yesterday.  We ordered the gnocchi as a primi, and secondi was to be bistecca fiorentina ala Sangue.   We had to ask for our waters, our wine, and other things we just sloughed it off, as that is typical and italian. Nothing rushed. We certainly were not in a hurry but it seemed like our order was forgotten.  Everything arrived at once which when we ordered we indicated pasta first, steak second.  The Steak arrived medium well to well. We expressed that while we were not trying to be difficult, we ordered our steak specifically rare. That the steak presented was near well done. When you are paying $22 or more a pound, you kind of want it the way requested.   So the server took it back.   Rather than fix the issue, our order taker returned. Expressed that she looked at it, and found it to be lightly pink in the center. That it was only the edges that were well done.   Now I don't know if she though we were youngsters or what, but trying to convince guests a nearly well steak is rare, and presenting it to us again and asking us to accept it twice really killed the whole meal. We stated that we were sorry, but we could not accept the steak the way it was cooked.  No offer of a re-do.  Our wine went to waste, and we left hungry.  We were absolutely sad, wasted an afternoon and fuel.   Though things happen at times where people forget, and we are forgiving, the fact that it was pushed upon us to feel bad about a cooking error should not be placed on guests ever.",

We complained and they offered to take it back and recook it.  But after a 50 minute wait, I was not ready to wait again while my husband finished his meal.  I asked to have the item taken off the bill. They were unwilling.  I asked to speak to the manager.  No luck.  I then asked to see the owner. He was belligerent, insulting with no regard for us being regular customers and asked us to leave.  By the way, it was a $47 strip steak.",

The food was delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant and the workers were friendly.  The issue I have is they don't allow any customization of any kind to their sandwiches. I was looking for an 'italian' kind of sandwich with a bunch of different meats and peppers but they didn't have anything like that on their list of sandwiches. When i asked if they could do that, the woman said no. They make their sandwiches a certain way because 'he' (the owner?) says they're best that way. Ok. I guess. There was also about a 15 minute wait for the two sandwiches to arrive.   So the food was good, but don't expect to customize your sandwich.",

Everything made from scratch, women cooking at every possible hour each and every day in the kitchen, Sunday family feast dinners....the whole shebang.  So needless to say, I am very critical of Italian restaurants because in most cases I know I can make any dish better at home. Andreoli's is one of the few Italian restaurants I continuously come back to. Why? Because the first time I came here 6 years ago I knew it was legit Italian food the moment I walked in the door for two specific reasons : A. They serve grilled calamari. B. They have a seat (in this case entire table) designated for the owner. If you come from an old school traditional Italian family, you will understand grilled calamari trumps fried calamari and the males of the household always have a designated seat at the dinner table.  If you want to feel like you are in your Nonna's kitchen or eating a meal in Italy, you won't regret paying a visit to Andreoli's",

Our drinks were not what we ordered as we requested cans and instead received drinks from the soda dispenser and when we questioned there was too much ice the counter person looked puzzled and merely said 'oh okay'.

    "text": "Full review blogged:  Crostini di Fegatini alla Fiorentina:  $5. Nothing complicated here, just rough ground chicken liver pate over homemade toasted bread with a bit of parsley.  Served chilled and ample in portion, no complaints.  Maialino:  $18.  The most limited item on the menu this spit-roast baby piglet was gone by the time we left and although the skin could have been crispier the flavors were spot on - the pork supple and rife with notes of garlic, rosemary, coriander, and pepper while the skin was slightly sweet and plenty smoky.  Panino con Porchetta: $8.95. Much like the Maialino this could have used a bit more crackle on the surface but all things being equal it would be pretty hard to complain about crusty Italian bread wrapped around warm pork roast with plenty of black pepper, fennel and light citrus notes.  Baccala` in Umido con Polenta: $18. One of my primary reasons for wanting to visit Andreoli in the first place was this dish and thankfully it did not disappoint one bit.  Big in portion, huge in flavor, and in my opinion the most well executed dish of the afternoon I figured going into it that the cod would be excellent and as good as it was, the biggest shocker of the dish was perfect execution of the polenta - toothsome, dense, and a veritable sponge for both the tomatoes and the briny fish.  Caponata Sicula: $5. Simple, savory, and perhaps the deal of the day this plate of tender eggplant, briny capers, pine nuts, tomatoes, balsamic, and olive oil with hints of basil and onion was plenty to share and would have only been better with some warm bread for dipping.  Trippa alla Toscanaccia: $14. With almost half of our table having never eaten tripe and another not really a fan of the dish I figured I'd be doing most of the legwork on this dish and although everyone took a taste my suspicions fortuitously proved correct - an acquired taste for sure, this was really good.  Thin like soup and plenty fatty despite being loaded with meat with notes of onion, tomato, and vinegar at the fore while mint and garlic came through on the palate this was another place that some extra bread would have been welcomed as far too much broth remained at the end.  Mille Feuille: $7. While I contest this should have been referred to as a Napoleon I guess it really doesn't matter because regardless of nationality what we received was flaky pastry wrapped around lightly sweetened pastry cream.  Clearly not as transcendent as some of the a la minute options being turned out elsewhere as this one had been stored in the chiller all day I have to say I was largely impressed by the separation of the layers and lack of sogginess.  Rhum Baba: $2 each.  Also straight from the chilled case these traditional baba were everything one could hope from the classic dish - a buttery ball of pastry drown in rum; a sledgehammer of flavor up front with a buttery sweet finish; at one bite each I'm pretty sure I'd have been tipsy with a half dozen.  Struffoli: $4.  Another very traditional selection you don't really see all that often at Italian markets or bakeries these marble sized pastry balls were crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and absolutely dredged in honey.  A stark textural juxtaposition to the baba which was soft throughout I personally enjoyed these a lot, though having sat for a while the honey had begun to harden which made them a bit difficult to extract from the small dish.  Cornetti: $2.50.  Golden crisp on the outside, buttery caverns within, and fortunately a brand new batch when I ran back in to make my purchase this warm nutella croissant was the highlight of the sweets for me - a strong contender for best croissant in town that remained fluffy despite the chocolate-hazenut filling while the exterior shattered to the tooth.  Sfogliatelle: $3.  Lightly citrus thanks to the use of candied lemon peel, even crispier than the cornetti on the outside, and a pillow of ricotta smoothness within - if you go to Andreoli and don't order one of these you're missing out...as a matter of fact, I'd go so far as to suggest that this item alone is worth a visit to Andreoli as it was every bit as good as any I've ever tasted on either coast (admittedly having not yet been to Italy.)   Schiacciata uva: $4.  I'd never tried this prior to Andreoli's and, as a matter of fact, I'd never even seen it.  Quite simply a focaccia base with fresh grapes placed at the center prior to baking thus allowing the juices to infuse the dough as it cooked this was sweet, light, and full of flavor - the sort of dish that would be easy to whip up for a party and equally easy to dress up in any number of variations.  The Verdict:  Fresh, rustic, and very authentic this one definitely goes on the 'under the radar' list and while I'm unable to speak to Andreoli's quality during normal business hours I can only say that based on what I experienced at the Christmas festival I'm eager to return.",

    "text": "So I did not read any reviews until after I visited Andreoli's Italian Grocer. I feel sometimes when it comes to italian food I have to make my own opinion. Being brought up with some of the best Italian cooks back east it is hard to go out and eat italian. I took my Mother and Son to try it out before we recommended it to our family. We took a 30 minute drive. With that said here is my review...  It is a small place, almost like a italian kitchen. There were the regulars sitting around a table watching soccer on TV. It felt authentic and welcoming Until...  \"The counter\" we experienced the gal at the counter who was not concerned about answering our questions just wanting to know what we wanted and if we did not have an answer she moved on. We finally were able to make a decision and order.    We did order the Eggplant Parm, the Mozzarella, basil and Tomato and the beef with provolone. I have to agree with the reviewer in regards to the eggplant. There was a lot of skin that had to be picked out of the sandwich in order to enjoy it.  The beef and provolone was delicious. The flavor in the meat was spectacular. The Mozzarella, basil and tomato was delicious except I would have preferred it on the roll rather than the focaccia bread. The side salad dressing was flavorful. We ordered a side of Bread and oil because we were hoping to try the oil before purchasing the bottle. The oil was very smooth and the bread was exactly how I remember it back home. We ordered the sausage and peppers to take home to my dad. The sausage was shaped like a hamburger but it could have used more peppers and onions on it. My dad did enjoy it.  After our meal My Mother wanted to purchase the bottle of oil and some bread to take home when she approached the gal with her $25.00 bottle of oil she asked to get 2 loaves of bread.  The bread was pricey $6.75 a loaf But worth it! The gal said you can only get one loaf. My Mother's intention was to buy a loaf for my son because he loved it so much. My son then went up to the counter to look at the chocolate they had in the case. He was ignored for about 5 minutes until I went up to help him. He is 13 and almost 6 feet tall so it was not that they could not see him. He chose a piece of chocolate that looked like a screw. He mentioned that it was the best piece of chocolate he has had in a long time!. I was with him and I purchased the 2nd loaf of bread. A bit silly we had to do that!  I would definitely go back again just to purchase a loaf of bread! The food was delicious. Yes they need to step up their customer service skills but then again it didn't bother me to much as I grew up around Italians just like that, so to me it is not a deal breaker weather I would return or not. But the purchase of only 1 loaf of bread that is bothersome. Especially when you drive so far  to expect it to be a grocer as well as a deli and then you buy a $25.00 bottle of oil you need more than one loaf to go with the oil! They need to either add more products or take the grocer name off because it is a little deceiving.",

    "text": "I'd been hearing about Andreoli for quite some time, but it took me until last Thursday to go for my first visit.  That first visit was so good that I returned for dinner tonight (just a few days later).  On that first visit, I was with three other people and we shared a large mixed salad, oilves, and two different kinds of focaccia.  I had the minestrone soup for dinner that night and then we all shared several desserts.  My favorite was a merengue dessert with frosting - delicious!  Tonight's visit was just as good.  My husband once again had homemade pasta with veal meat sauce (their version of Bolognese).  I shared the fettucine with lobster in a light red tomato sauce with my mom.  My brother and dad both ordered the pork sandwich, and we again started the meal by sharing a large mixed green salad, fresh bread, and an antipasti platter.  Once again, we couldn't end our meal without something sweet, so my dad chose a nutty nuget for us to share.  While it's a casual atmosphere / grocer, and you place your order at the front counter, the service is attentive and the food is as authentic as I've found in the Valley.  We will for sure be back with the bambino in the future... Bellisimo!",

Pretty much a walk up and order and wait until they bring you the food. At that level of service I wouldn't expect Veal Scallopini to be $32 and have it arrive warm and chewy. Bread was burned. Pasta was cooked well but the veal sauce was just ordinary at $17.  Especially disappointing was hearing the famous prosciutto was sold out but I don't believe it. I think they hold it back for their regulars. What we got was a $10 antipasto plate that was paltry and pathetic.   All in- $72 (1 beer / 1 bottle of water). Many other low service places that offer better choices (like DeFalco's) nearby that are lower priced and taste better.",

The bread is perfectly fresh every time.  The salad dressing, while rather simple, is surprisingly great for some reason I can't put my finger on.  We've always loved it.  The dining area is very small with just simple tables, and there's a small patio area.  I've never had to wait for seating however.  They don't have any sort of a bar but there's a selection of a few wines by the bottle at a reasonable price.  Note the name is \"Italian Grocer\" and their roots are in selling some great deli meats, bread, and ready-to-use home-made pastas.  You can get top quality meat and bread to go as well as a variety of their pastas and sauces.",

The place is nice and comfortable. You can sit inside or outside. The staff is nice. You order at the counter and pay at the near by register. After paying they give you a number to place at your table so they can bring your meal.   So like I said, it's nice decor, it's cozy, and the employees are nice....  It's really just the food that's not good. We ordered  pasta fagioli to share and we each had a sandwich. My sandwich was eggplant parm.  First let me say the bread was pretty great!  The eggplant was stringy and mushy, and the sauce was so sweet it wasn't edible. They brought the sandwiches before the soup. I guess it's not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to have the pasta fagioli first. Well, that is what I said in my head before I tasted the bowl of beans and olive oil the brought us. This was not edible.   The sandwiches come with a side salad. One of our side salads had a hair in it. Not ours. Not edible.  The mozzarella cheese tasted home made but not good homemade. It was extra mushy and runny.   Oh I also ordered a slice of coconut cake. It looked amazing! All of the baked products looked amazing. I had to stand in line again to get the cake even though I had paid for it previously. The first bite... Sadness... Stale.. Hard crusty cake.   They gave me the money back for the cake but not for anything else. I didn't ask though. Oh well, you win some you lose some. It's never fun to leave a restaurant hungry.",

It was all deliciously well seasoned and cooked to al dente perfection. I cannot wait to go back for a sandwich...maybe a sausage and peppers or the porchetta. I only hope the secret doesn't get out on this place and become a crowded mess! So happy to find an authentic Italian joint like this exists near me!",

My go-to is the caprese sandwich, Viva I'italia so good!  I highly recommend for a quick lunch break or easy dinner pick up! Our family even gets toppings for our homemade pizzas from here! Check out Andreoli's!",

I ordered the Ciao roast beef and onion sandwich, my husband had the spicy salami sandwich and my dad had pasta, my son ordered the pizza and my mom the thin sliced pork sandwich which I didn't take a pic of theirs. My sandwich was simple and delicious my favorite part of my meal was the side salad, the dressing I loved! I tried my husbands sandwich it was delicious and definitely spicy, my moms yes I tried hers too had great flavor.. the pizza is a thick slice of bread very light sauce and very light cheese my son didn't like it at all. I thought it was good the bread itself was light and not all chewy but definitely needs more cheese. The bread that came with my dads pasta was delicious you can definitely tell everything is freshly made. The Nutella butter cookies so good.",

I ordered the porchetta sandwich. It was served with a crispy bun, a fair portion of porchetta that was slightly salty for my palate, and with a side salad of greens in a sweet and sour Italian dressing. I thought it was a solid lunch portion and enjoyable.   My SO ordered the seponimo (I cannot remember how to spell this). It was made with homemade prosciutto, mozzarella, and some roasted peppers. The thinly cut, homemade prosciutto was tender and flavorful. I liked how it paired with the mozzarella--it just absolutely complements each other plus the roasted peppers. I'd probably would have liked a bit more salt in the sandwich. It was solid, but I felt like it wasn't bursting with flavors.  Additionally, this place has fun decor throughout! It's also partially a market so there's various cheeses and even pasta for sale.",

An order of calamari is probably less than 50 grams.   I think the very best, although very expensive at about $15/pound, is any cake.  They are moist with wonderful flavors.  We had a pistacchio cake and went back to bring two slices home.",

Even took a dollop of frosting off a cake and ate it. Never washed her hands.  When we got our order I mentioned to her what I had seen, she denied it at first and then just nodded and said ok.

Our go-to favorite is the grilled calamari with the delicious light lemony sauce perfect for dipping his wonderful Italian bread in. We shared another one of our favorites; the carpaccio, thinly shaved lean beef on a bed of greens with a light olive oil and vinegar dressing topped with thin slices of Romano cheese. Mussels were one of the specials and we shared that served in a white wine sauce. The mussels were large and very tender and again the sauce was so good with that wonderful bread. My husband then wanted one of his antipasto platters with a great assortment of salami and his homemade prosciutto. We shared a bottle of the house red wine from the Puglia region of Italy. It is a very good dry red with lots of flavor and not too expensive for just 30 something for the bottle. We had espresso and shared a small piece of hazelnut chocolate bark that I believe is homemade. We were so full that we took dessert home. One cannoli which was very good; nice crisp shell filled with delicious cream. I tried the chocolate mousse which was so large a serving I finished it the next day. Very creamy dense rich dark chocolate, yum!",

The waitress forgot to bring me my coke and then I had to ask two different people two different times to please bring my coke to my table, it arrived half way through our meal. We had a table of 8 and when our food arrived, we were given one basket of bread. Each person had a small piece of bread and as we were eating, I tried several times to ask for more bread, but no one would even stop to speak with me. I then went up to the ordering line and asked for 3 baskets of bread. About 5 minutes later, we were given 2 baskets of bread. When I went to pay my bill, the guy charged me for 5 baskets of bread, I told him to remove the coke from my order since it didn't arrive until after my meal and that we did not get 5 baskets of bread. The guy replied \"yes you did, you got 3 baskets at the beginning of your meal and then you ordered 2 more\" I corrected him and told him we got 1 basket and he started to argue with me saying that he saw the guy bring my table 3 baskets and then 2 more. The manager then came out and told me I had to pay for 5 baskets of bread and I told him that I only received 3, as both of them began to argue with me, I just gave up. I will never go back, the food is not authentic, it's normal Italian food just like we make at home. The food is over priced, the wait staff that I had which involved, 1 girl who ignored me, 2 guys who helped take our order, the manager and one of the guys who started to argue with me, they were are extremely rude and had zero manners.  You will see below that the owner of this place has the same attitude as their employees. This was the manager that I'm talking about above in my review. Like I would take this much time to make up this story, you sir need to work on manners.",

I've never been to Italy, but I've been to Little Italy in San Diego so I feel like I had the credentials to adequately wax on the wonder of Andreoli's.  The second you step in, you're gonna feel like that you're in an authentic Italian environment. Sauces, coffee, bread, and oils adorn the walls and fill the restaurant/grocery store with products that also provide for some pretty awesome decor.  This is one of those places where the mantra is \"my way or the highway.\" They make the food and you will eat it. No one really smiles or seems to be outgoing, but really all that matters is that they care about their food.   I ordered the #2 aka The Caio...which is thinly sliced pieces of beef, melted provolone, and sauteed onions. on a soft baguette. Medium sized sandwich that will fill you and leave you with a satisfied smile. The beef is thinly tender with the perfect amount of warmth and full of taste. The side salad  is fresh and light.  Just an amazing sandwich....which is exactly what I was hoping for when I saw that it cost $8.25. The sandwich is worth every penny and I can't wait to go back to try their dessert.  I also tried the leeks, which was basically the french fries and they weren't super crispy, but these are definitely worth sharing among friends.   Lunch for two is gonna run at least $20.",

My husband said maybe it's supposed to be like this....could not pick the slice up and transfer to the plate without half of the topping sliding off. The pizza pan was wet with juice. We are disappointed but there are many other pizza places to go in Scottsdale. I am confused how this got so many good reviews. Must of been an off night.",

Let me start by saying that I'm a first generation italian....I think I know my way around legit italian-american food ....this place is the real deal!   In fact, I would dare say that this is some of the best Italian 'fast casual' food I have ever had.  Highlights. ........ ............................ We decided to split some sandwiches since they had so many interesting choices.   The eggplant was sublime....never had such a delicious eggplant sandwich...the sauce was out of this world....don't expect a tired old take on eggplant parmigiano with heavy breading or slabs of mozzarella. ...it's super delicious and a fresh take  If you think I liked the eggplant. ...then wait until you try the porchetta sandwich. It was crazy good!  Excellent pork with nice use of spices and herbs...the fennel was great.  All the sandwiches came with a small house salad on the plate..... generally $9... a good deal for high quality food.  Lowlights. ........ ...........................  Most of the staff was very helpful and service was fast.  BUT....I feel the same way as other reviewers about the hostess behind the counter....she has zero flexibility. ...my wife is not as adventurous with food and wanted the beef sandwich without the hot relish....she preferred some lettuce on the sandwich......easy right?  Nope....no can do.....did I mention earlier that a salad came on the plate?  They could not move a couple of leafs of lettuce on the sandwich?   I should mention that at the time of ordering, we did not know that there was a side salad included so we were super perplexed about the lack of flexibility.   Obviously,  the world did not end because of this but it showed a weird complete lack of customer service.  But forget the lowlight....the food is awesome....real good, authentic italian food!

Now I've been to Italy, hell ...I grew up in Nice, France. Not 'old world' enough for me, I ordered the Maresciallo Italian antipasto with their meats & cheese which took forever to get and charged me over $10 (big rip off) and my friend ordered a Bastard baguette (dis-appointing). This place is too over-priced in their offerings. The main reason for this yelp is the rudeness of the staff here, the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treated not only us but others in line with arrogance. Also the old man, possibly the owner had the same air about him. Granted there were many off duty scottsdale police hanging around, but the whole scenario reminded me of a mafia 'front', just like back home. I guess this is a hit or miss from reading all the reviews, maybe its just from others low standards?",

They have a price tag of $ on local eats. NOT! this is a rip off place that is misogynist and wishes they had better ambience and service. They are hoping to take advantage of nice people who just want a great place to eat. Have you ever been shouted at by the owner when no one else is around? Well I advise you to skip this place especially if you are female and alone. No respect. No service. Just rude goofballs  like the owner who feels it is his right to shout at females and give supbar serrvice with their switch and bait menu. I ordered a meal for $19.95 and got charged $86 and told to go some place else and never come back. Well I may never eat there again but I am determined to let my fellow travelors know there are much better places to eat with much better service and owners. DONT GO HERE AND WASTE YOUR $~~~ Save your time and money. Go someplace else where they appreciate women and good service and dont try to rip off nice folks,  This is thr type of Italian men we wish has stayed in Italy. CREEPS~~~",

    "text": "We started out with two appetizers, the tomato caprese and fried calamari.  For the caprese they used grape tomatoes, EV olive oil & basil over the cheese.  It was just average.  It needed a drizzle of vinaigrette with Roma tomatoes, not grape.   The fried calamari was horrible. Overcooked, barely breaded (more like a dusting) and didn't come with a marinara for dipping.  It came with a side salad which doesn't make sense as a pairing.  The sandwiches were made with a nice combo of fresh meats and flavorful bread.  I had the sausage with peppers & provolone.  They use freshly ground sausage and flattened it on the grill top vs. using links.  Loved it.  My wife & friend ordered the pasta with sausage & peas.  Very good.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  My friend's wife had the seafood platter.  She didn't eat much of it.  I would stick with the sandwiches or pasta dishes.  The service was very slow.  They have one TV in there and it was on an Italian speaking soccer channel.  We were the only table in there at the time and asked if we could watch the hockey playoffs.  They couldn't figure out how to find the channel so my friend's sister showed them how to do a search and found it.  15 minutes later the chef/owner comes out from the kitchen and put his Italian soccer back on at a high obnoxious volume.  He got up and went back to the kitchen and didn't switch it back to the game we were watching.  I think he was mad that someone thought the TV in the dining area was for the customers.  How silly of us!  They call themselves a grocer and yes, you can buy cheese & cold cuts to take with you.  They have shelves of pasta, sauces, oils, olives etc.  I checked the prices and had to chuckle.  For example, they have bottles of Giardinara marked at $11.99 that you can buy at Portillo's or the supermarket for about $3.    We bought a bottle of the only available chardonnay and paid $30 since they didn't serve it by the glass.  They gave us tiny 4 oz. rock glasses to drink it from.  The wine probably cost them $8.  It tasted like Ripple.  While the young men that worked behind the counter or bussed the tables were very friendly & helpful, the girl that takes the orders seems unhappy to be there and doesn't greet people in a friendly way.  Bottom line is they have great potential but don't seem to have a clue on how to capitalize on it.  They lack consistency in every way.  Some food tastes great while other items are very weak.  Some prices are very fair, while others are clearly a rip off.  I was quite surprised for a Tuesday nite that they became pretty busy by the time we left.  They have obviously developed a following that I would not have expected.  If we lived nearby we'd use the place for pickup on certain dishes only.  But we won't go back.",

After looking at the menu on-line I knew my husband would want to eat there and we hopped on the road for our adventure.    We were barely two steps in the door when sure enough it was decided we would stay for lunch.  The young lady behind the counter, I am thinking the owner's daughter, couldn't have been more helpful.  I had picked out my sandwich on line, but switched to a daily special of rigatoni with ricotta and cherry tomatoes and my husband spotted peppers and sausage on the counter and he was sold.    Our lunch was fabulous and we returned to the dessert counter for a treat to take home.  Sadly only so much fits in the fridge.  My husband wanted to have his parents come up right away as they are huge \"real\" Italian foodies too.  As tomorrow is Sunday and they are closed we will have to wait a day to return, but we will definitely be back soon.  I also loved the antique tables and items mingled in the store.",

I discovered this little gem a few months ago when a bartender at the Merc bar (Italian import named Francesco) told me to check it out. The chef owner bakes all his own Italian pastries, makes his own pastas, pulls his own mozzarella and imports his meats and cheeses. He changes his menu  daily and makes wood fired pizzas on Wed and Sat. This is my favorite local Italian spot hands down... but for full service authentic restaurants, I suggest Michelina's in Scottsdale(amazing and upscale) or Harley's Bistro (equally amazing but less formal and good luck finding it) in Central Phx.

    "text": "Ok, I give up. I had a previous review of Andreoli that I gave 3 stars. They probably didn't care anyway. I gave it a lower rating because of the lack of service.  At this point, I just don't care. I've been back to Andreoli for lunch a couple times in the past couple of weeks and the food is just so good it doesn't matter. I also didn't have a repeat of the wait from hell so maybe that's helped change my mind?  The first visit back, I went with Giovanni's recommendation (which I'd heard from Eytan over at Phoenix Knife House) of the Mortadella (kind of similar to bologna but so much better) sandwich. Just Mortadella & nothing else. It was killer. Loved it. I've never had a bad sandwich all the times I've been there. Their bread is killer. Always nicely dressed. The salad that comes alongside is wonderful. Can't go wrong. I was with 7 people and they all loved their food.  We also did a number of orders of the patatine fritte (fried potatoes & leeks). They're pretty much the best french fries ever. I also ordered some mozzarella in carrozza (fresh mozzarella and bread dipped in batter and sauteed). That was quite nice too.   Washed it all down with a Limonatta.  My last visit, I had the ridiculous fried potatoes & leeks of course and they were awesome. I did the arrapato sandwich (breaded pork loin with arugula and parmigiano). Stellar again.  So I just give in & admit that I'm addicted to the food at Andreoli and am already overdue for my next visit.",

So be prepared to experience something completely different than what you are used to.  The food is the most authentic around.  The owner and chef, Giovanni, is humble when he acknowledges that he gets at least 3 marriage proposals a week (which I found out after asking him if he was interested...)  :-)  The prices are fair to a smidgen high- but the man has his father picking herbs off the mountainside in Italy and shipping them stateside.  He makes the cheeses, pastas, and sausages by hand.   And he is almost a snob about using only the freshest and highest quality ingredients- many from Italy.   How freakin' cool is that?!!     You will LOVE it here!   (PS- it is really funny to see how many Italians come in there.  I guess they all know where the good stuff is!)  Warmly,  Kirin :)",

The Italian sausage sandwich is served on baguette bread with grilled onions and homemade Italian sausage. The food was excellent and nearly enough for two. The leak fries were great and served with green onions and a dipping sauce which had a trace of olive.   While there, I saw a guest come in just for an order of freshly made bread, which looked incredible ($7.35 out the door; the loaf was huge).   Prior to leaving, I ordered their two most popular deserts: the tiramisu and pistachio cake. Both were AWESOME; however, I thought the tiramisu was just slightly better.   I will be back; perhaps tomorrow!",

To be fair, the veal sauce was excellent, but the penne was seriously undercooked (yes, I can tell the difference between undercooked and al dente).  And it was served pretty cold.  We were not offered any parmesan to go on top of the penne.  And although we got bread, it was four slices of thick bread.  No oil, no butter, just plain and dry.  On the other hand, the mixed green salad was very good.  I like a lot of dressing, so for me it was fine.  Others who like less dressing might disagree.  We went in the evening, so it was dark out.  It was also pretty dark in the restaurant.  The lighting is dim and unflattering, and the seating is a hodge podge of mix and match furniture.       The service is okay.",

    "text": "While there are groceries sold here, the real emphasis is on their italian deli and the other foods they serve. The food they serve, sandwiches, salads and entrees, are fantastic. The pastries, including sfogiatelle and chocolate croissants, are fresh and scrumptious. The place is soccer central. The television is always on ESPN Deportes.   The spaghetti a la vongele ($25.00) is absolutely the best I've had in Phoenix. Almost makes me think I'm near an ocean. My companion loved the veal chop ($34.00). Both entrees came with a salad. There are a number of genuine italian beverages, including orangina and birra Moretti.  On previous visits I enjoyed a number of their sandwiches. They come with an arugala salad and there isn't a clunker on the menu. The forza, the cafone and the abuffino are my favorites. Sandwich prices range between $8.25 to $8.95; not cheap by any stretch. However, like a wise old man once said, \"Good oats command a good price. But, if you're willing to settle for oats that have been run through the horse once...\" (LOL!!)  Some reviewers have had less than desirable service. I can only say that the service given to me and whoever was with me was top notch. The young fellow behind the register and the young lady who brought our food were courteous, generous with their time and kind to those friends of mine who were not familiar with italian food.   Count on spending at least $15-$17 per person. That said, it's well worth it.",

Our friends beat us there, had a nice bottle of Italian red open and a table on the patio. I was a little apprehensive until I realized our friends are regulars, they raved on the food, and we went to the counter to order.  The cases were loaded with Italian deli meats, cheeses, olives, anchovies, aged t-bones, a massive veal chop...things were looking up. We looked over the blackboard menu and the regular dishes, and made some selections. Not your run of the mill pseudo-Italian joint.  The rigatoni with meat sauce was very good, rich, spicy, and tubes were perfectly al dente. The grilled calamari was exceptional, not overcooked and rubbery as one comes to expect. The house made mozzarella salad with tomatoes and basil was reportedly excellent, though my wife offered none to me, bogarting it entirely. Everything delivered a sense of freshness and had a home made quality.  Service was friendly, familiar, like a neighborhood place that you would return to again and again. The payment scheme was strange, as you go back to the order counter and pay as you are ready to leave. But that was no problem. And prices were very reasonable. I would come back to Scottsdale just to eat here again.",

    "text": "Updating my review to once again give Andreoli five stars after another four years of being a regular patron.  Another reason for my update is to say that even as a five star reviewer and regular, I do completely understand some others' criticisms of a visit to Andreoli, especially regarding the price, ordering system, and the, shall we say, \"opinionated\" owner.  Yeah the system might take some figuring out--you order at the counter, you sit, and then you'll get food runners who can take additional orders, and then you can pay at the register either when you place your first order or at the end of your meal. And yeah the brusque nature of owner and some of the staff may take some getting used to, but frankly the genuineness of the place is what give it charm. Too often in the U.S., and especially in a place as new and sleek as Scottsdale, Arizona, we get a sanitized version of life. Sometimes the beauty is in the give and take, and the personalities you feel as you dine in what is essentially the owner's living room. So, as you go to Andreoli, take a deep breath, step back, and be charmed by the authenticity--for better or worse--that we often lack in Scottsdale. Once you get to know the system and the staff you'll be treated like family. The food is definitely worth it!",

I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says \"Focaccia is Italian\" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.  So I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has \"echemica that is a bad for your brain\". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)  So Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.

This review is not for the food, but for the attitude we experienced at Andreoli's.    As visitors to Scottsdale we were looking for a place to pick up talian specialty and deli items and two options, Andreoli's' being one, popped to the top of our list.  Since my hubby is Italian American and grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn, he has more than a passing acquaintance with good italian deli's and \"attitude\".  Loves the former and the latter doesn't phase him a bit.  Usually.  But at Andreoli's he walked out without making a purchase.  Here's why...  We were the only customers in the store at about 6pm on a weeknight, so it's not as if they were too busy or we were too impatient.  But we waited for some time before a staff person, who had just been complaining - loudly - to someone else about a rude customer - asked \"You know what you want?\"  When we said we were new to the store and trying to decide the response was roughly, \"When you figure out what you want call me, I'll be in the back.\"  You know that old comic phrase, \"This job would be great if it weren't for our damned customers\"...well, we wonder if that' might be the slogan at Andreoli's based on this single experience.     That said, it seems as if Andreoli's has a decent selection of deli items (although not as good as  one of their competitors perhaps) and a great selection of imported Italian specialty items, like taralles, capers packed in salt, nougats and so on, and a freezer case full of ravioli with different fillings that looked pretty darned intriguing.   So, we wondered, why was the place empty at about 6:00 on a weeknight when one might think people should be coming and going to pick things up to take home or eat in?   Maybe we're not the only ones who decided the attitude wasn't worth it?  We left without making a purchase.  But given all the great Yelp reviews, maybe we just hit this on a bad day.  Still, we'd echo Jan S's observation in her review from her experience in December that there is a sense the staff doesn't care.  And in this economy in particular, we want to do business with people who do.",

Hospital food is yuck compared to it.   I went back again today, I needed some comfort food after the stress of my little girls surgery, hey I need an excuse for the carb overload.  I ordered the Porchetta and the Forza Italia, plus of course a couple of chocolate croissants, 1/3 of a pound of salami and some Zuppa inglese for an additional dessert. The food here is amazing, yes, the customer service is not the best.  They remind me of my Zio Aldo.  Always with his smug smile and always telling everyone around how \"stupido\" they are.  I miss him.  You need to think like George Costanza, not make any sudden moves or comments for fear you will get \"No croissant for you, one year!\"",

I had the pleasure of taking home some cheeses and cold cuts as well as few other items that are not readily accessible at any regular grocer. This place has a lot to offer. Living in northern California, we still are deprived of some some decent Italian meats that are anywhere near the taste from the old country. I'll definitely be stopping back I. The next time I'm in Az. Also, the Panatone selection around Xmas time is awesome! Hopefully they bring back the Loison brand. They were a hot commodity at our place.",

All the staff was very nice from the gentlemen who took our order, the gentlemen that rung us up and the one who brought our food.  The food was extremely delicious!  We all (4 of us) got something different from the fried calamari, rigatoni bean soup, Tizio (sausage) sandwich and the Abuffino (spicy calabrese) sandwich.  My sister kinda grimaced when her calamari did not come with a dipping sauce and the salad only came with the oil and vinegar.  The calamari was so delicious it did not need a sauce.  And the salads (served with the sandwiches) is amazing!  Fresh and tasty!  We will defanitly return!",

I have no problem paying for good food, but this just wasn't worth the money. For four of us - including one child's meal - it was $100. And that was with no appetizers. Guessing once you're featured on Guy Fieri's show, that justifies charging double the price of a normal meal???  Had the gnocchi, penne with veal sauce and lasagna. All were good, but they didn't wow us. Also, not sure why they are an Italian grocer, since they have only a handful of grocery items. But you can buy a loaf of their homemade bread for JUST $8.75. WTF? I can walk out of a bread-only bakery in NJ with two loaves of Italian bread and a dozen fresh baked rolls for $2!!!!",

I could eat it all day, every day and be a happy camper (Ask for some balsamic to go along with their fabulous EOO)! A few of my favorites are the maresciallo (meat and cheese board), fratelli d'italia (caprese-like salad) and their pasta options change frequently but they are all amazing!  Last but certainly not least, their sweet treats are off of the charts. I love their Nutella cookies and chocolate cake! Warning: The photos may make your mouth instantly start watering! :) Enjoy!!

First we had an antipasto, a meat board with some dried meats, cheese and olives as well as Italian bread. This is real Italian bread, crusty on the outside soft and dense in the middle. They had my favorite dish Tripe, it was so good I had 2 orders of it. We also had the sausage and ziti and the porchetta sandwich. The house Chianti was delicious, nice and dry. We finished off with the coconut cake, sfogatell. This was an awesome dinner all around.",

It was a party of eight, the place was somewhat empty so we had time to catch up.  I asked the people I was with what they recommended and we came up with two sandwiches.  The first sandwich was on the daily specials menu.  It was a meatball hero which was very good and reminded me of Sunday Dinner at Grandma's. The second sandwich was the #6 the Porchetta. Which is roasted pork seasoned with garlic, fennel and black pepper.  Both came with a side salad.     The total cost for two drinks and two sandwiches came to about $25 which is a little high, but I think the food was worth it.   Just an observation, it seems like there are a lot more Italian delis in the Scottsdale area since the last time I was out there.  I don't think that is a bad thing is it?  It is just an awful amount of competition.",

    "text": "I really had high hopes for this place. I saw it on diners & drive-ins, plus an old Italian friend said he liked it, but it turned out to be just meh. I started with  a dried beef and Arugula salad. Followed by a grilled calamari plate, kind of chewy, cooked too long I think. Finally we split a seafood pasta and a Pork dish. The fish in the pasta was overcooked also and dry not much sauce served over regular spaghetti, but the sparse sauce may be the style. The pork was good even if paper thin. Once again that may be their style of the dish here. We had 2 small glasses if house wine. I'm talking about barely a 4 oz pour. The bill was $106. Definitely not worth it for how mediocre them meal. I guess I'm willing to spend that amount for Italian food but I expect to be blown away by the food.   Not much ambience and the service was fast but not more than minimum effort. The place was not busy.",

The only reason I only gave it 3 stars is that I thought the cost for the portion size was very high. Actually, everything on the menu is on the pricey side.

After 6:15 pm. Tuesday at 7 pm? Sorry. Saturday at 5:45 pm? Outta luck. Wednesday and Saturday after 6:15 pm only. Like I say, this is a family-run place and they do things their way.

Once they arrived the sandwiches contain 2 slices of prosciutto and 2 slices of mozzarella and several marinated peppers. But the final insult was another table was seated and I timed their food arrival at 9 minutes. This was when I confronted the manager about an explanation as to why it took 35 minutes to make our 3 sandwiches and only 9 minutes to bring out the food for the other table. All the manager did was say he was sorry in the most insincere manner I have ever seen. I would give them zero stars if I could.",

You know, the kind where the Proprietor kept track of what your family owed him in a spiral notebook. If you grew up where I did, you probably had at least one of these. I was lucky in that my neighborhood had two, but neither was as good as Andreoli's!  How about the fact that they have a Regular Menu and a Special Board every day and I have NEVER had anything I didn't like or absolutely love, after more than a dozen visits?  How about the fact that I have pretty much narrowed down my choices on each visit to one Appetizer (Have had almost all the sandwiches and they are great but too filling to have anything else) and a \"Special?\"  How about the fact that on each visit I absolutely MUST HAVE the Italian Bread with Extra Virgin Olive Oil (have to order - it's a \"Deli!\")? Absolutely the very best Italian Bread I have had since leaving the East Coast. A bit expensive but I take a loaf (BIG!) home, slice it, put paper towels between the slices, put all in a plastic bag in my freezer. Thaws out as it went it! Delicious!  How about the fact that going with friends allows you to have more \"tastes\" by ordering lots of different dishes?  How about the fact that the folks behind the counter (specially the young Lady) are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful?  How about the fact I have NEVER been for Dinner but friends who have say it is just as terrific as lunch?  How about the fact that the Pricing for \"Specials\" may be a little steep (especially the Seafood Specials) but the quality is absolutely First Class and almost all are well worth the price?  How about the fact that I can't list my recommendations, as it would just be a restatement of the Menu, but have the \"Fries?\"  I guess I have not only started, but have finished as well.",

    "text": "I am extremely torn on this one.  On one hand we tried house made finely well crafted salumi , house baked breads. These are some of the things they do really well in an authentic kind of charming little homey place. These things are clearly five star.  But if I rate honestly for the dinner at their price point I I feel I had more of a three star experience and I DO NOTE THEY MIGHT HAVE HAD AN OFF NIGHT.  We had excellent house made salumi and ordered a focaccia to try. These were very good no complaints.  For dinner I tried the branzino. ($34) It was wood fired grilled. The fish was good and fresh but might have been slightly over done because it was difficult to remove the fish from it's skin. I can't sugar coat this and I have to absolutely honest and say for a $34 dinner they were not on their game with the vegetables. If you take the time to look at my photos I think you would agree. The green beans seemed like canned but might have been fresh and really might have been old and way over cooked. The green beans had the same color as canned green beans and were falling apart all threw the other vegetables. The carrots were firm in the center but the outsides were falling apart too. Now I would be OK with this if this wasn't a $34 dollar dinner. At this price point this meal is pretty equal to what Gianfranco and what Sassi would charge for a similar dinner so I feel my plate and particularly the vegetables should have been a similar quality.  My husband went with the Veal Chop. ($36) The veal was pounded thin like what you do for Milanese. The veal itself was good until you got to the bone and by the bone you couldn't eat it because it was raw there but if they cooked it more the thin veal would be over cooked. This plate had the same vegetables as mine so I don't need to explain the vegetables because you already heard it.  This is a very casual place. You order at the counter and a food runner runs your plates out. Our plates got ran to the wrong table before they made their way to us. Nobody checks on you. We waited for a check and I guess the service is European Style so when you feel your done you pay the cashier.  I'll try them again for lunch. For lunch I am certain I will have a four or five star experience but I note for lunch.",

A young gentleman snickered and said something in Italian which all the \"young\" attendants laughed and even clapped at his response.  I understood them all completely.  I wasn't huffing or puffing or upset where my food was.  I simply inquired, politely.  First time is not a charm for this place.  Customer service is a huge thing in the restaurant business.

    "text": "I always have to hit Andreoli when I'm in town. It's like escaping to Italy for a couple hours. Seriously, most times I've been there I am the only person who speaks English natively. The menu consists mainly of sandwiches, salads and starters, then there's a specials board that changes daily, including entrees and pastas.   This last visit, we stopped in on Pizza Night, which is every Friday and pretty delicious. We were seated in front of the outdoor pizza oven, which proved to be the best dinner theatre ever! Giovanni, the owner, was fired up hotter than the oven itself. Yelling at the staff and his daughter in Italian, which I fortunately speak, so I was able to understand everything they said. They were screaming about running out of pizza, which happens every Friday. Lucky us: we got one of the last pies. Mushroom and sausage. It was up to par with all the rest of their outstanding fare.   We also enjoyed a pasta bolognese, which is a regular item on the special board. Andreoli puts out the best bolognese in the city. Hands down.   Other items I suggest: 1. The steak sandwich, kinda like an Italian Cheese Steak. Unreal. Steak. Fontina. Need I say more? 2. Anything made with their housemade sausage.  3. The speck sandwich. Not too heavy, great flavors from the smokey pork, blue cheese and arugula.  4. If you have a big group, have them make you an impressive antipasto plate. Yum.  5. Artichokes 6. Tiramisu. OMG. Save room.  Also, I'd suggest bringing your own wine. Corkage is pretty cheap and their selection is just OK. The cheapest bottle you can get is $30 and is really lackluster. Oh, and never ask for any substitutions. They will not accomodate, but the food is amazing and should be enjoyed as they make it.",

Yes, you have to go back up to the register to pay. No, it's not cheap. It just doesn't matter. Eating here is the closest thing I've found to eating in Italy in the US (and yes, I've eaten in Italy). You will not get Americanized food here. This means pasta that's actually al dente, and not swimming in sauce. Portions are not chain-restaurant gigantic. On most days I've been there, at least one table will be full of people speaking Italian. It's almost like you stepped inside a teleporter and came out at a small, local restaurant in northern Italy.   Some people who have posted reviews of Andreoli below wouldn't know real Italian food if it hit them in the head. I'm personally happy if they go elsewhere, and I think the people who run Andreoli prefer it that way too.  In addition to the food, the deli is also first rate. They have guanciale and lardo, two things I've never seen anywhere else in Arizona. The bread is so good it will make you cry (which I do when they refuse to sell me some to take home. They won't let it go if  they are running low). The house made sausage is so good, I won't buy it anywhere else now.",

I asked him to give me a half a pound of his spiciest salami and a baguette.  I planned on taking this home to make a great sandwich.  While my order was being sliced, I wandered around the store looking at all of the great italian food products. Pastas, olives, breadsticks, pastries, you name it, it was all there.   Long story short, I got home about ready to make my sandwich, and tried a slice of the salami. Incredible! There was no way in hell I was going to put this inside two slices of bread and dilute the flavor with mustard, mayo, cheese, etc... Instead, I  sliced up the baguette, grabbed some brie, and made myself a mini smorgasbord. The salami ruled the day. The bread wasn't bad either.  I can't wait to go back for lunch and try some cheese and bresaola or maybe a full sandwich.",

However, $16 for a plate of simple marinara style pasta that u order at the counter is outrageous. In addition, 1 can of Italian tuna is $10. Something u can get at Cost Plus World Market for $4 max. A small bottle of mineral water is $6.50. Everything in the store is way-way over priced. Good for a cup of coffee & home made dessert.",

    "text": "I noticed Andreoli's, and actually went by it many times on my way to and from different businesses in the Fry's center. But for some reason, I had never gone inside.  Since I live nearby, I try to explore all the interesting eating places in immediate vicinity, and one day I decided I was hungry for an Italian sub.  Since I was near Andreoli's I decided to give it a try (plus the Vermont Sandwich Company was closed).    Entering the deli, it was very nice inside - very comfortable looking and small, with a few tables. Since I was looking for a sandwich to go, I looked at the menus on the reader board/white board and ordered.  The sandwich came in a to-go box, with a side of salad. There was no one else in waiting, and it took several minutes for someone to notice me - but that was ok since I had a chance to go over the menu. The person that took my order was very informative and nice.  When I received the sandwich, I was initially disappointed, since it seemed small for the price, and as always, I was hungry.  But I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived home, and had a chance to taste it.  It was very good - the bread was perfectly cooked, and the meat and cheese were very complimentary.   I have gone back several times and  tried different sandwiches and pastas, and everything I have had is delicious. So if I am really hungry, I will go to other places in the area. But if I am craving authentic Italian food, and am out for a walk, I go to Andreoli's.",

    "text": "I'm in love. I've been wanting to go here ever since I found it on Yelp and finally had the chance to go. The set-up is a little confusing when you get in, but luckily I went with a \"regular.\" First, you go up to the counter where they have their menu on chalkboards and order behind the counter. You then get a number and have to go stake out a table. They then bring your food to you and you pay at the counter after you're done. I know, it doesn't sound that complicated but it's a pretty tight space and there are people everywhere so it was a little overwhelming. Anyway... I forgot which sandwich I had but it had salami and cheese on it, which is a win for me. The sandwich was a little smaller than I expected, but turned out to be the perfect amount. The side salad was simple but tasty. I had the tiramisu for dessert too which was delicious. I was told that the croissants are a must have and went back on a weekday around 7pm. They had plenty of croissants left and I got a cannoli too. The croissant was so good. Buttery goodness. I would love to try one in the morning after they've been made. It was packed when I went on the weekday too with families. I'll definitely be back, would love to try their pizza and gnocci!",
