    "text": "Not sure why this isn't known as one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. We found this place through their excellent catering. We have eaten here three times and have had wonderful food and service each time. We highly recommend the halibut, either grilled, or as a special with tomato and Feta cheese on it if they have it. However, everything we've had has been excellent. The menu is not pretentious--just solid, delicious fare well prepared. It could use a little less salt sometimes, and I'm not a fan of as much garlic as Italian restaurants use, but the food is so good that I put up with the liberal use of garlic. Prices are very fair, wines are excellent, service is outstanding. It says something when the service staff (and probably the kitchen staff also) has so little turnover. They are professional and polished. Visit the bar three times, and they'll likely remember your name on the fourth visit. Michael is the consummate host. I want to go there for Happy Hour soon-it looks awesome and at great prices. Desserts are typical, and good, but not memorable. Try this place out. It's a gem.",

    "text": "Abridged: Good food, hotel restaurant feel.  I headed to Alexi's with friends for some good old carbs & veggies before a run on a Saturday night. When I arrived, I was a little worried as the over starched burgundy table decor and lack of patrons made me think of a stiff uncomfortable hotel restaurant.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the menu looked fantastic with so-so prices. I ended up getting the primavera dish and stayed with water for my drink. The food was great, even down to the bread. I devoured it with pleasure!   In the end though, I don't think the patrons or staff were amused with the out of ordinary conversations my friends and I often like to have. The food was good enough that I won't write it off my list, but I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't welcome my kind any more haha!!",

And it definitely felt like most of the diners there were 50+ (maybe they have a good senior citizen discount?).   For an appetizer we ordered the fried calamari. I thought it was pretty good, my mom thought it was too greasy & she might have been right. For dinner I ordered the grilled halibut, the halibut was very good (minus the tomato & cheese on top- I took them off). But the veggies that came with it, not so much. They gave me a lousy 3 wedges of red potato, a bland tasting piece of broccoli & way too sweet carrots. My mom ordered the grilled vegetable pasta. She thought it was too salty but I thought it was pretty tasty. The garlic & pesto sauce was so good! Oh & our meals came with a side salad, that only came with one option for dressing. Some creamy, lemon concoction that was not good, what ever happened to good old ranch?! For dessert we ordered the flan. It was pretty good but I've definitely had better.  It wasn't bad or anything but I really doubt we will come back. Maybe for happy hour but it's doubtful.",

The atmosphere is a bit odd, but the servers are good natured and quick.  The only reservation I'd have is the odd treatment I sometimes got by the host(ess) when I did not have a reservation.  I was a regular at this place for a long time.  Occasionally though I'd forget to call ahead to reserve a table.  Even if the place was completely empty, without a reservation the host(ess) many times will become visibly annoyed and act as if it is a big deal to find you a table and then put you in a corner somewhere.  I don't know if everyone feels that way, or if it was only a way to try to condition me to call ahead next time since they knew my face.  Overall however, other than that, it is a decent place to go for the occasional grub.",

    "text": "Had a late lunch here earlier this month with a friend. We enjoyed siting on the patio. The bartender was a nice guy and attentive. We placed our order with him and later a server came on and took over and though he was a bit awkward and odd he provided nice enough service. I opt to have the Crispy Calimari as a starter. At first it wasn't very good at first -not crispy and too oily, but we sent it back to be cooked longer so that it was crispy and my lunch partner agreed that made it much better.  I had the Trout (farm-raised always a let down of sorts) Almondine ayet  I was very pleased with it! I would return again to have it.  My friend had the suggested Chicken Piccata dish that is popular there. It was okay, we could both tell that the chicken was prepared solo and the sauce added afterwards, then again we both cook and I have made this dish a number of times and know it well.  The side dish was a lame serving of a few (and I'm serious about a few) wedges of red potatoes like maybe 3 or 4 wedges and 2 crowns of broccoli!  Also we both had the house salad that was a nice mix of greens with the house dressing (you get no salad dressing choices!).  We had 2 glasses of wine each from the happy hour list and mine were very nice. Then we had the strawberry cheesecake. Huge slice! However lacking on the strawberries and enough sauce to properly dress the cake which alone had a wonderful texture but lacked flavor. Knowing this dessert is the one thing I would certainly change on a future visit.  The menu has a nice variety of options and the prices were within an acceptable range of $7 to $12 for this somewhat upscale lunch setting.",

He silently delivered my coke and took my order. I got a chicken ceasar salad. The food came out quickly. Salad was underdressed, chicken was well seasoned, but overcooked. By this time the bartender was nowhere to be found so I couldn't get a drink refill. When he finally came back, I asked for my check and he silently delivered. So, I was not impressed with the place. I would tolerate bad service for awesome food, but since neither was impressive, I won't be going back.",

Dinner was exceptional. Hot like your mother just took it from the kitchen amazing mushroom sauce on the chicken, cooked perfectly. Oh and they prepared some food outside so the aroma was like you were in Florence. Seriously. The pasta was out of this world, vegetables cooked just to the point of a crunch. Bread, yum. And of course desert, I tried them all. Absolutely a 10. You can not go wrong with this caterer.  I have also enjoyed lunch and happy hour at the restaurant. It is such a class act.

    "text": "I have to say that I have been to Alexi's Grill on several occasions through  the years. It always reminds me of what it must've been like in the days of the  'rat pack'. It just has that kind of  'feel' to the restaurant. There's always people at the bar.  It's not far from my home and the food is pretty good. I loved that in previous visits, they went out of their way to accommodate your request. I love grilled veggies, so they used to grill veggies at my request, but that was a few years ago. I looked forward to going there because they were kind but, now, although they weren't rude I will not return. I ordered take out today after looking at the menu (in all fairness it was on Grubhub). The price, I thought, was decent....until I got the bill. The menu was several dollars less PER ITEM than what they charged me. When I brought it to their attention the  'hostess' (she may have been new as she didn't seem very knowledgeable about how to treat customers), said to me that she'd \"tell the manager so no one else gets confused.\" She didn't offer an explanation, certainly didn't offer to match the online price and just dismissed me as if it didn't matter there was such a discrepancy. I'm not sure what happened but the food wasn't as described and I've never had mushrooms on my chicken piccata. It wasn't as good as it used to be. The Melanzane Alexi (also more expensive than what the menu says) was not visually appealing and didn't taste at all as I expected it to taste. I threw it away. The eggplant was pale and looked as if was old. I did ask for a side of grilled zucchini, but the waitress said that it was already cut and they couldn't give it to me. Previously when I asked about grilling veggies, I was told that they'd happily grill veggies for me, although that was a year or two ago. Yes, I've been going to Alexi' for several years. It's sad, I will not return. It would've been different if they would have at least faked concern about what was happening.",

Having said that it is not pricey -- the lunch menu is very affordable and a great place for a business lunch.

The server showed up seconds after offering drinks and menus. I chose the Halibut my wife had the Salmon and our toddler had Alfredo. I tried a bite of everything and I must say it was AMAZING.

Michael was truly the best we love and adore him for helping in such a big event. We had called about 2-3 other caterers which in our case was disastrous. Some were hard to even get a hold of, they would ask what we wanted and literally threw a number at us or whenever speaking to them they seemed preoccupied. When speaking to Michael he was always attentive and friendly, he asked to meet us in person to discuss in detail what we wanted and to give any menu suggestions as needed which was great. Michael also went over all the ingredients that would be used and different options if desired. We did a tasting of the food that would be served which was phenomenal!! The food was fresh and savory, the day of our event every one raved about how great the food was. Alexi's is definitely a must try restaurant, I highly recommend the meatballs they are delicious!!!",

I ordered the chicken picada and my friend being vegetarian, ordered a salad.  They brought the bread and butter, I thought the bread was a little tasteless and I love bread. We waited and waited.  I finally asked where was our food, oh it should be ready (tells you something).  I went to the restroom and our food was on the table when I came back, I looked at mine and it had something red on the top, I finally was able to flag our waiter and said this doesn't taste like picada and he said it's not, mix up in the kitchen, took the plate and brought  my picada and by now it was cold.    My friend said someone (not our waiter) brought my plate and then came back and took it away and brought the dish with the red (assuming it was sundried tomatoes).  Yes, I would say that was a mix up, but it was not the kitchen's fault.  It was the waiter's.  I had asked for extra sauce and bread to dip in the sauce, got neither one.  He had a party of six come in and after that he practically ignored us. I am a fairly good cook, I go to a nice restaurant for the service as well as the food. This was NOT good service, in fact it was terrible  We'll eat at the game next time.  As for the food, again the bread was tasteless, the vegetables were almost raw (not that I like mine over cooked, but i could not cut them with my knife) the picada was okay, but mine is better.  Don't think we will be back!",

He even pulled up a YouTube video to show us a monsoon he was describing. They served us so well (boxing up our food, refilling our water, refolding our napkins, etc). They even gave us a complimentary dessert!!! We felt like royalty. The food was also delicious. I ordered Vegetable Pasta and the amount of vegetables was unprecedented. We also had the Fettuccine Alfredo and it tasted so so smooth. I think there was a block of butter in there, but I'm not complaining.

My son had shrimp and shellfish over pasta which he really liked while my old pal tried the salmon special.  Everything was made to order and served quickly.  We arrived early for lunch (11:45am) and by the time we finished the dining room was pretty full with business men and women which I believe is an at testament to its popularity.",

The rack of lamb is one of the best I have ever had. And the carrots.........for a simple side dish I couldn't have asked for better!  (I would love the recipe for these carrots!) Parking was no problem.  All of the wait staff were very courteous.  We will go there again next time we are staying in downtown Phoenix.",

We could see the waiter, talking with others in back of restaurant. We had to wave at him for more water.We did sit there for a long time because it was an occasion for us. Since it was not crowded, we felt we were not taking up a table for anyone else. The waiter came to check on us right after our meals were served, but that was it until we waved at him for more water. We did expect great customer service since we have always had it there in the past....................not this time",

I asked to see a wine list when asked if I'd like wine, and the waiter proceeds to insist that I just tell him what type of wine I want then he will tell me what they have. So, I said no, I want to SEE the wine list. Well, not much to see.  And the one I did want from the extremely short list, they were out of.  Please.    The \"bread\" service comes and it is a basket of the worst breadsticks (hard and inedible even with butter which I had to steal a knife from a neighboring table to attempt to spread on the roll).  My caprese was only adequate... Tomatoes underripe and only olive oil as an addition with some sliced basil. I did like the table top salt and pepper grinders which made up for some flavor (perhaps add the option of a balsamic glaze?).

The soup was well made and perfectly proportioned for a before dinner soup...I ordered the smoked salmon alfredo  which came out so fast it made me sceptical of the quality. But alas the salmon was very good and infused through the the whole meal though I will say it was a little sparse...the food was wonderful and as a rally give a 5 star this hits a solid 4 with price being fare the service being amazing and the food excellent.

I realize its summer and all, but the table next to us one gentleman was in a white tank top. Not my expectation for this type of restaurant.

This restaurant in downtown Phoenix came highly recommended by several of the secretaries I was working with and since it was in walking distance of the office, I decided to give it a try.    To be totally honest, it sucked.  Complimentary bread and soup was served for starters.  The bread was stale and I've had better soup out of a can.  The server was so busy flirting with the tall and very tanned ladies at the table next to me to pay much attention to the rest of his customers.  He spent a good deal of the time ignoring me; I was constantly having to ask him for things I shouldn't have to ask for--such as a fork or a drink.    The menu is pretty extensive; though low on the veggie options.  I chose the bowtie pasta with veggies.  It was carrots, zucchini and peppers in a light herb sauce which was bland and served just barely warm.  Very disappointing!  Due to the slow service of the flirty waiter, I was there far longer than an hour and got back to work late, out about $15 and still hungry.  Don't waste your time!",

    "text": "My friends and I were enjoying a girls' weekend in Phoenix and picked Alexi's Grill due to a reservation being available on Open Table on a Friday evening (June 5, 2015). It appears we had a similar experience to another Yelper that very evening. Our server was obnoxious and condescending from the start. We asked for menus as the hostess had not given them to us, and he chastised us and said we could not have menus until we ordered drinks! So we asked for a wine list/drink menu. The server said they did not have one and we should just tell him what we liked. We're still not sure if they don't carry top shelf liquor or if the server just wouldn't share that information with us. My friend ordered a gin and tonic and I ordered a vodka martini. We are not used to well drinks, but that is what we received. As we were ordering our drinks, my friend asked for bread as she was feeling sick from not eating lunch. The server didn't know this, but he responded, \"We don't bring bread until you order from the menu.\" Everything he said was rude and peppered with attitude. My three friends ordered the Chicken Marsala Southwest and I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana. The server said to one of my friends, \"You know that's hot, right?\" and as another friend declined soup or salad he said, \"You know it comes with the price of the meal?\" We were just appalled at this point. The house salads were fine. We were relieved to be moving on with the evening. Then our meals were served. My eggplant was rubbery and tasteless. I can make better eggplant at home and I'm not a chef. Our server did not return until my friends were almost finished with their meals, so obviously I was not going to order a replacement meal at that point. My friends' chicken marsala meals were bland and completely uninteresting in any way. They ate them just because we hadn't had lunch and needed protein! The server did not apologize for my meal, nor did a manager come to our table. The only thing I can say that he did do that was proactive was remove it from our bill. This was the second time in my life that I have not left a server a gratuity, but he managed to make this the most unpleasant dining experience I've ever had. I would not recommend the service, the drinks, the food or the decor. I'm not sure how this place has four stars on Yelp.",

Fresh Alaskan halibut topped with feta cheese, tomatoes and a very addicting lemon Garlic sauce was my choice for entree. Came with house salad  and bread. Dressing was homemade and one if a kind. Entree was so delicious, fish  , very fresh and topped amazingly with the feta and sauce was awesome and simply highlighted by a delicious sweet buttery carrot side , broccolli and oven roasted potatos. And finally the chocolate mousse which maybe the best I ever had.....",

It's on the ground floor of a high rise and the sign is a bit plain. It appears dated to me from a drive-by perspective. But the interior is modern, crisp and clean, with white linens. The windows are spotless and give a nice view of the high rises and a nicely landscaped courtyard with a fountain. They also have an easy to use private parking lot.  The food was excellent and well priced. They have a full bar. The menu has a great blend of traditional entrees as well as elevated dishes. Pasta, steak, pork chop, and several nice seafood dishes. Homemade bread, salad dressing, sauces, etc.   The service was excellent. A unique find.  Lunch is in the $10-12 range and dinners are $15-$30.  Give Alexi's a try. Just north of the Walgreens at Central and Osborn.  I only regret not trying it sooner.",

    "text": "Alexis's Grill was a bit of a disappointment. I made reservations to take my team out to dinner and a few were new employees. I didn't ask everyone how their meal was but if mine was any indication I'm guessing it was average at best. We started off by having water brought to the table and had to send back two of the 7 glasses that weren't just dirty but had food stuck to them very visibility; not a great first impression. I had a salad with my meal and while fresh had only lettuce, no other garnishing on it so it was somewhat boring. For a main course I had a filet that was grossly overcooked and dry. If you're going to offer an expensive piece of meat the very least you can do it not cook it to within an inch of its life. I ordered medium and there wasn't an ounce of pink. The waiter never came back and checked. I had vegetables with it and they were fine, not a lot of seasoning but at least they weren't overcooked. Someone at my table had the soup that came highly recommended by the waiter but thought it too was bland. The hostess was excellent; friendly and nice. The waiter was not overly intrusive but after delivering the meals never checked back. I didn't send my steak back because I was with work people and didn't want to make a scene. However, if the waiter had checked in and paid any attention to the doneness I would hope he would have insisted on getting it grilled right.  Overall, I was not pleased with the impression I made with my coworkers in my attempt to take them out for dinner. I will not be going back. It was a long drive for mediocre food.",

It also came with a starter salad, which is always a welcome touch. The salmon was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The veggies were...well...healthy I guess.

    "text": "Alexi's Grill & Catering 3550 N. Central Ave Phoenix, AZ  85012   As part of Restaurant Week, companion and I dined at Alexi's. Restaurant Week features prix fixe menu's with limited selections. Some restaurants use this week as an opportunity to introduce new customers to their food selections, while a few others use it to take advantage of unknowing customers. Fortunately, Alexi's does not take advantage of their customers and provides a nice meal for your dollars.   Drinks were brought quickly and we were brought a basket of warm bread sticks along with some nice salt butter. Many restaurants serve unsalted butter, which just does not have the taste that many people are looking for.   Companion started off with the Calamari appetizer. Many places destroy a wonderful appetizer by over cooking it. Here there were nice rings and tentacles lightly battered and fried to perfection. For myself, I ordered the Caprese Salad, which was made with some wonderful buffalo mozzarella, ripe tomatoes, and a chiffonade of basil. Some excellent olive oil and a dash of balsamic completed the dish nicely.   Next, cups of bean soup arrived. This was no ordinary bean soup, did not come from a can, and did not come from the freezer. This soup was made from scratch with love and attention to detail. Tiny canele beans with small diced carrots enhanced with a beautiful broth type soup. No heavy glop here, if they offered this soup canned, I'd be buying it by the case.   For the main course, companion ordered the Lobster Ravioli in a cream sauce. Five nice sized ravioli's gently swimming in a pool of excellent cream sauce. Very rich and quite satisfying.   I ordered the Pork Chop cooked pink, as the USDA now allows pork to be cooked. A good sized chop on the bone arrived perfectly cooked as ordered. The chop was accompanied by al dente broccoli, roasted baby potatoes, and some outstanding sweet carrots that were stars of the show. Companion kept stealing some from my plate!   Dessert consisted of Cheesecake with macerated strawberries, and Tiramisu.   Service was excellent, and cleanliness even to the outside areas was in evidence. Dings - only one - when any restaurant serves a nice piece of meat, be it steak or chop, it is wrong to serve a serrated knife to the person dining. The serrated knife only serves to tear the meat apart instead of gently slicing it into edible portions. It bothered me to look at my knife after cutting this excellent chop and find pieces of meat stuck to the blade.   4 stars for service, quality of food, and cleanliness",

The prices are pretty good though and it's close to work so I find myself meeting friends at Alexi's for lunch fairly often, always hoping the food will get a little bit better. I would recommend they change up the menu occasionally as well. It's been the same for the last year and a half at least and it could use a revamp.  The marcus pasta is the best dish I've had here but the sauce is thin and it usually needs some salt. Not a horrible restaurant but any means, but there's a lot of room for improvement food-wise. Excellent service though!",

Once we entered the dining room, there was no table available. Whew!   They have a good menu with a lot of options for vegetarians/pescatarians! I was super impressed. I ordered the shrimp scampi and the noodles were cooked perfectly. They were the right texture and the shrimp was so tasty and succulent. No skimping on the shrimping either! Plenty come with the dish so you don't have to ration your shrimp over the course of your meal. The bread served was also addicting. Cause I. Love. Bread. I ate so much of it, with the butter melting on the inside. Just scrumptious.   Due to a large party, the amount of time it took for the food to come out was a little longer than I expected, but the staff were so kind, they apologized and offered free dessert, which who turns that down? I ate off my moms Limencello Mascarpone Cake, and our spoons were fighting over the next bite.   You can tell this is a family place. As people were leaving, they would address them by name, and the guest would reply, \"See you next time!\" And I can see why.",

My entree came with a medley of vegetables including yellow squash and zucchini.  To top off the meal, we indulged in the most delicious Limoncello Mascarpone cake.  It makes my mouth water - just to think of it.  Alexi's Grill is one of Phoenix's best kept secrets.  At Osborn and Central, there is plenty of parking.  It is also a great place to visit on Friday and Saturday evenings for the downtown events.  Call ahead though!",

The restaurant itself is bizarre...fancier than I expected. Happy hour is only in the bar, but you can't get dinner in the bar area. However, you can sit in the restaurant area and walk up to the bar to get drinks on happy hour. What??? Doesn't make any sense. The food was very good but I wouldn't come back here. Vibe is weird. Service was great too but for a place boasting a great happy hour and great food when you can't get both at the same time? No thanks",

Wonderful happy hour! I had so many wines to chose from and great appetizers offered.   THe bartender, Rick, was very sweet and also offered to put in another glass of wine before happy hour ended. I would've only had one but after this nice gesture I obviously couldn't turn down the second glass.   I ordered the appetizer mussels in white wine sauce. They were delicious. The pricing was great on al the entrees.   The lightning was dim so this looked like a nice romantic place for a date. The customers were very friendly. It was a rather older crowd and you could tell they were regulars. It was someone birthday bray and when they sang happy birthday most of the restaurant chimed in. I would absolutely love to make this my regular bar/restaurant.",

The drinks were well priced too - $5 wines, margaritas, and $2.50 bottled beers. This place looks like it's been around forever and I assume lots of regular diners.  I went for lunch today and got the chicken tortellini and didn't like it - but I think it was my fault because I didn't realized it was soaked in a Alfredo type sauce and I'm never into that. Definitely check it out for a happy hour snack/meal if you're in the area though.",

The hostess was amazing, the servers were slow. I don't recommend anything with the marinara. It's bland and lacks seasoning and general fresh-tomato-ness. The calamari was chewy and the fried cheese boring. HOWEVER our party thoroughly enjoyed the halibut special, the filet, and the lobster ravioli. Veal shank was largely left behind. Carrots were so sweet we all only ate one. Broccoli was fabulous. Salad boring. Bread fair. Atmosphere charming and nestled in a boring and somewhat barren part of town.",

    "text": "Wow, what a downer for my only chance to eat out in Phoenix.  Here on business with many colleagues, the choice was made to eat at Alexi's since it was an extremely short drive to the hotel where we were staying. Our party consisted of 8 adults who were all extremely hungry and ready to place our orders after waiting for a table for a short period of time..not more than 15 minutes.   For a Monday night, I must say that the place was pretty packed.  The server was a very kind, sweet man who came across as quick, but lagged terribly with everything.  I am thinking it could have well been the delay inside the kitchen--not him...as again, he was pretty efficient. We ordered some appetizers of caprese = good, and fried calamari = ok.  Their bread that they provide = okay--nothing extraordinary. Most of us were ready to order quite quickly, but the food just took absolutely forever.  We probably started eating our food around 8:30pm, after being there for more than an hour munching on our appetizers which were devoured in seconds and sipping on our beverages. The food all in all, everyone said was mediocre and regretted what they ordered.  The steak was dry, my colleague said, the sauce was too heavy and drowning the food, another said, and so on... One colleague left her nearly full plate behind and said that the taste was off from what she was expecting. I ordered the chicken marsala which was really good actually, but just way too much sauce...You couldn't even taste the chicken--just sauce! For a hungry bunch of out-of-towners, Alexi's was certainly nothing special. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone coming to downtown Phoenix...business or pleasure.  I gave them two stars because the server was very cordial and the servers overall gave a nice impression.",

The room is nicely appointed (nicely appointed?...who says things like that?), comfortable and really reminds me of an upper westside NYC restaurant. Pasta pomodoro, shrimp parmigiana, minestrone soup, house salad all dee lish. It reminds of an NYC restaurant. Hostess in a tight dress. Waitresses all with big hair. Older waiters, follicly challenged and oddly all with moustaches. Naked Cowboy on the sidewalk. Ok, maybe not THE naked cowboy. But one day I did see a cowboy type with daisy dukes and a muscle shirt that read \"My belt buckle's bigger than yours\". Hmmm. Anyway, the clientele seems to be older Scottsdale type, women in furs and men with furry backs, who dare to venture into Central Phoenix. Me?

My husband and I had made a reservation for 5pm and arrived at 4:55, the hostess said that it would be a few minutes and that we could sit at the bar-not a problem for us since we knew we were early. Well 5 came and past and we were still sitting at the bar, there was literally every single table open in the restaurant, so it's not like we were waiting for someone to leave. Completely open restaurant. Another couple walk in and were immediately seated while we were still sitting at the bar (not drinking literally just sitting there waiting to be seated). The hostess then tells us we are next after she had walked by us while seating the other couple. Disappointing to be overlooked and ignored right off the bat.   Luckily after finally being seated the server promptly took our order and was very attentive throughout the meal. We ordered the meatballs to start and the filet mignon and the vodka tortellini for our meals which were  amazing. The food was very good quality for the price.   If it wasn't for the saving grace of the food and wait staff I would have left with the bad taste in my mouth that started the visit.",

A little upscale as white linens drape the tables along with a plethora of silverware.  Tables are nicely spaced to allow easy access and private conversations.  The little vegetable garden, plants and trees surrounding the front of the restaurant bring a little tranquility to central phoenix.  Came here for Arizona Restaurant Week with several friends.    The Caprese salad  was good. I wish they could have jazzed it up with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. The Calamari was plentiful and was good.  The soup of the day was cream of mushroom.  It was the best dish of the evening.  The salad was basically romaine lettuce with a wedge of tomato with a oil/vinegar dressing was boring.  The dressing needed some herbs to give life to the salad.  Everyone had the pork chops.   It was a very large cut, but it was overcooked.  The meat was dry and difficult to cut with the knife.  The accompanying demi-glace and vegetables were very good.  I would come here again to try some of the other food.  I like the atmosphere.  Staff are extremely nice and well trained.",

Never had less than very good meals here.  We ordered three appetizers including the calamari, mozzorella sticks, and meatball and penne. Hands down the best was the calamari. It was very tender and served with a very light coating.   I had the gyro and salad. Others had various pasta dishes and sandwiches. The gyro was tasty and filling. It was served open face. The salad had a nice vinegarette dressing.  Service was excellent. White linen tablecloth with black cloth napkins, yet the lunch prices were very reasonable.",

However, my mom passed away in 2010, so my dad hadn't been back since her death. Well, I bought us some tickets for West Side Story st the Ph. Theatre located down the street from Alexi's Grill. Pop mentioned that he and mom would eat here back in the day, so I figured let's see if they are still around. Thank God they were!   Pop called a day or so before we arrived to see if they had Osso Bucco. They didn't have it but said they would pick up the ingredients from their sister restaurant, Christo's and would prepare it for him! Now that's great service!! The food was to die for, too! I had the veal chop, and my husband had the rack of lamb! It was delicious! We also had calamari and mussels for appetizers and they were equally as good!   All I know is that I can't wait to return and bring my Smart Set Sisters with me!",

    "text": "I've been a long time fan of this mid-town phoenix, neighborhood grill.  I have dined here for years, due to the fact that two of my friends work at nearby office buildings.This was was our go to for our lunch get-togethers.  Even though it seems as if this place had been overshadowed by many of the nearby newer and hipper establishments this stalwart restaurant has been a gem to the informed dining patron.  Surprisingly, I've taken many of my friends and family here but neglected to take my beloved wife here. Imagine that! I endeavored to correct that oversight, and committed to making reservations one Wednesday evening.  Why Wednesday, you may ask? Because any night is date night, and Wednesday's is art and culture night in mid-town Phoenix. The Phoenix Art Museum is open late, and would make a great accompaniment to a wonderful dining experience.  Upon arrival, we were promptly seated by the friendly hostess.  Our server made a mad dash to ensure that we were promptly attended to, with nary a delay.  He went over that evening's specials, and we opted for both of them. I had the grilled and glazed chicken with mushrooms. My wife had the Glazed 16 ounce pork chop.  The sauce that enveloped the glazed chicken was absolutely sublime. It was a little on the sweeter side, but not overwhelmingly so. The accompanying vegetables such as the broccoli, glazed carrots and potatoes were perfectly prepared - not overdone, but not raw either. Their tender and succulent consistencies were heavenly.  Speaking of heavenly, my wife's Glazed Pork Chop, although overkill for most anyone's appetite, was just simply incomparable. Prepared like a steak, but considerably tender on the inside. It seemed to definitively declare that it truly was better than the other white meat!   Every bite just melted in both our mouths (we often try to share our main course choices), and the glazing gave it such a rich texture.  The service has never failed me. The servers are always polite and charming - full of personality, and thoroughly engaging.  This turned out to be an amazing choice for a mid-week date night. Or any other date night, for that matter.  Then it was off to the Art Museum, to walk off all the carbs!",

The best part, their happy hour goes until 7p! Yes, please! Even the working folk can make it here in time for some light bites and snazzy spirits.   Beer and cocktails range from $2-$5. The best part, select martinis are only $5! I had a tasty lemon drop! For HH food, the potions are big and can definitely be a meal! They offer meatballs, calamari, Caesar salad with blackened chicken, Caprese salad, a combo plate, and more for $5-$8! Pretty much everything is $5 except for the combo (shrimp scampi, calamari, tortellini) is $8. Such a steal!   I'll definitely be back for happy hour before doing something fun downtown! They also offer catering if you're looking for that.",

The prices are reasonable.  My only suggestion is for Alexi's to offer a variety of side dishes, rather than green beans and rice every day.",

My daughters and I were out and about in downtown Phoenix and wanted Italian. We were tired of the Spaghetti Factory, so we found this place on yelp. We walked in and I was immediately regretting the decision, but the girls were hungry. First of all, the staff are dressed in formal shirts and the table linens are white. The impression is that it is meant for business meals. It is stuffy and not at all welcoming. For lunch, it should be laid back. The food was heavy Italian meals and salads. No kids meal was offered, so my daughter and I shared. We started with Provolone Fritta. It was a little overfried and the sauce was just a bit oversalted. It needed more sauce for the large pieces. We shared the chicken parmigiana. The chicken had a bizarre taste to it, so I didnt eat most of it. The salad before the meal was great though. Great dressing with lots of greens. Could have used more veggies. My other daughter had linguini w marinara. She seemed to like it. All in all, meals to make you sleep. Not family friendly.",

I got the vodka tortellini dish. Was NOT good. If you are looking for an awesome vodka sauce, check out Maggiano's in Scottsdale. It's the best I've had here in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is really odd almost slightly creepy. We went for dinner and sitting in an office dinning room having dinner is somewhat strange. It is on the first floor of and office building so I can understand but still. Maybe this place makes more sense at lunch time but for dinner, weird. Check out their website and you will notice no pictures of the dining room.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexisgrillphx.com&s=455d66f53ef5a7d45113871814008076dc4b26a7099526cea14fa5e65a091649\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">alexisgrillphx.com</a>  Our server was homophobic.

I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was surprisingly good! thick slices of eggplant with just the right texture, not greasy and not to cheesy. It filled me up enough to not be able to eat much of the linguine with red sauce. the red sauce was definitely serviceable, and the pasta fine but not exciting. My companions had the grilled salmon and the chicken. The salmon was a nice \"lunch-sized\" hunk. I was impressed by the option of drilled salmon and at least one other fish (I cannot remember what). The chicken-eater thought it was a bit dry, but commented that he thinks all restaurant chicken is dry...yeah, i too wonder why he keeps ordering it. The starter salads were a simple romaine hunks in a house dressing. Crisp and refreshing, but once again no excitement.   I went for a business lunch and the atmosphere was perfectly enjoyable. Bright and airy, not too crowded. It's more business like than going to The Duck or Postinos (both of whose food is better), so it's a good option for taking clients, meeting associates, etc. to talk shop. I wouldn't make it a destination place, but it's a perfectly acceptable uptown lunch option. I don't think I'd bother with it for dinner.",

All of the food that I have had at the restaurant is always cooked well and very tasty. The food is cooked in a timely manner too, so you aren't sitting around waiting for your food forever. The caesar salad is the best I've ever had!  Very nice place for a date night, or just to get away. Dim lighting, and candles on every table help with the ambiance of the restaurant. Dress is closer to business casual, with most men wearing a polo and nice pants or similar, and women are dressed up more than just daily wear.   I can not recommend this place enough!",

And most of the same staff is still there...including the chef! That alone speaks volumes.  The menu centers around northern Italian, continental and Mediterranean cuisine. We started with the combo appetizer. Yum yum! No rubbery calamari here! And the shrimp and tortellini were awesome. For entrees, we opted for the salmon and the halibut special. Again - to die for. Perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, moist and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The desserts looked incredible, but all we had room for was some spumoni ice cream. I know, I know...but it was a nice change all the same...and refreshing!  Our waiter was great, made sure all was to our liking as well as personable and friendly. We got there a bit early on a Saturday evening, but by the time we left around 7:30pm, the place was packed, and the patio was filling up.  Alexi's is not \"trendy\" or \"industrial chic\", and the interior may need some refreshing, but the food is excellent - and a great value. Prices are remarkably reasonable and the portions are healthy.",

I was trying to find a new place in Downtown Phoenix to eat at and since the reviews were positive, decided to give Alexi's a try.   The restaurant feels dilapidated, to me it did not seem old and charming, just looked as if it needs a serious renovation.  Reservation was Friday at 7 - yet there were maybe three tables seated, and of course they sat us right next to the other people despite an abundance of open tables not right next to someone else.   The food was above average and the prices are very reasonable.  Our waiter was attentive and explained the menu and specials very well.

    "text": "Our company just moved into the building with Alexi's and I was looking forward to trying it.  Ordered the gyro for take-out off the lunch menu.  Got it back to my office after picking it up only to find that it was missing lettuce and tzatziki sauce.  Went back down and had one of the employees tell me right off the bat that they were out of it...I mean what's the point of a gyro without tzatziki sauce, I ask you (I know, first world problems for sure but still very disappointing)?  It was clear that he knew when he gave it to me that they were out (it wasn't like he had to go back into the kitchen and ask).  Why not just tell me?  I was inconvenienced enough by having to come back down and ask about it...Would have been super bent if I'd traveled to pick it up.  He did go back and look around to make sure they didn't have any but it was pretty much like \"too bad, so sad\" on my lunch.  Probably won't be eating there again or recommending that anyone on our team do so either.",

    "text": "Excellent food for a fair and reasonable price (so unusual for the Valley). Great service. We started with the meatball and caprice appetizers. Meatballs were pillow soft, sauce is great. Salads were delicious with great homemade dressing and excellent fresh produce. My friend and I enjoyed the grilled halibut with a goat cheese and lemon herb sauce...oh my goodness. I WILL be returning for that dish...it was impeccably prepared and the flavor was multi-faceted. Divine! My husband's vodka tortellini with alfredo, jalepeno and black beans was unexpected and terrific. Four a party of four, with appetizers and two bottles of wine it was $120. A bargain for the type of white glove service and excellent food.  My only criticism would be the slightly dated interior, but the food was so great, I didn't care.  We'll be back!",

The small bread sticks that they serve you were just okay.  Not to flavorful and nothing to dip in accept plain olive oil.    The salad that came with the meal was large and the dressing good.  I ordered the eggplant parmesean and didn't care for it.  It was like 6 very thinly cut pieces of eggplant dipped in egg and fried.  Gooey texture, eggy taste.  However, the linguini with red sauce that came on the same plate was delicious and I'm not usually a fan of pasta with red sauce- to boring.  My husband ordered the Southwest Chicken Marsala.  It sounded amazing on the menu but didn't look nearly as good as it sounded.  Very little cheese on top and mostly green peppers swimming in a sauce on the chicken.  He drank coffee with his lunch.  The bill was $25 with tax.  I thought that was very reasonable for a nice lunch.  If I ever go back I will try something else on the menu.",

Appetizers were poor.Caprese was just pieces of cheese with tomato and basil sprinkled without any taste at all. We hoped for a better Main Course and ordered fettucino Alfredo with added chicken.After having a bite,we realised it has not been cooked and mixed properly.White Sauce was very thin in texture and not even mixed so as to give pasta a taste. We shared our feedback with the server,however to our surprise,the server was very rude,he brought the pasta back and again questioned us \"What is wrong with the Pasta? Tone was quite interrogative and we felt completed offended.  he did ask to replace the dish,however with that behavior,we decided not to eat anything else and   asked for the cheque. Server took the pasta out of the bill,but the whole approach was very insulting. We would never visit again and would not recommend to anyone else.",

This restaurant has the name Grill in it, so I was expecting a bar and grill environment. Perhaps not the best food, but I was very happy to find they served dishes of a higher standard .    The environment has a feel of fine dinning and the staff is dresses in manner you do not always find in the area Phoenix.  There are dishes you might find in a Greek restaurant as well.  I recommend Alexis Grill to anyone who would like something better than the same food you find at every chain in town.",

The food is EXCELLENT consistently and the prices are reasonable.  I always get the poached salmon (I won't eat salmon anywhere else...plus no one knows how to poach salmon properly like Alexis Chefs.)  I should at some point, try the other awesome dishes, but I just can't bring myself to do it!  Also, I LOVE their soups and salad...they are the best. You can ALWAYS tell when a restaurant has an owner behind it vs. a corporate restaurant with employee managers.  Michael, one of the owners, is incredible!  He truly cares about his business.  His wife Christine works there as well and makes you feel so welcome.  I have quite a few business meetings and I conduct many of them there.  The ambiance is perfect for business at lunch time and dinner is really nice and pleasant.  If I ever have a party, I'm going to have Alexis cater the event because I've seen some of their work and the food looks like works of art.  Next time you want a meal to remember, in a comfortable, pleasant setting with kind owners and stellar wait staff (Tommy and Steve, etc.,) check out Alexis...you will not be sorry.",

Alexi's Grill was not number one, but became so, after reviewing on Yelp and looking at the menu, which included 3-7 happy hour.  Arrived to park in huge lot, outdoor covered seating, lounge seating and dinner seating.  Met at door by Michael Zistatsis, co-owner.  We chose the window seat for two (romantic), as full dinner could be served there.  Happy hour pricing is tremendous-fried calamari for me ($5); my wife had huge blackened caesar salad, again $5; Cadillac Margarita for $5 and wine for $5.  Then dinner-all served by Tom, from behind the bar.  He earned a 30% tip.  Michael came back many times and did visit every table in the lounge at lease twice.  This is a mature crowd; not noisy.  2 TVs are in lounge, but not obvious.  We felt like we were wined and dined..so enjoyed ourselves.  By the way, portions were so large, be had enough for the next night's dinner.   We will be back.  What a great find !!!   Highly recommend.  Outdoor covered seating also.",

We started with the shrimp appetizers...my dinner partner had the feta shrimp with angel hair pasta, I had the filet mignon. Everything was cooked to perfection.  My only issue was the potatoes but only because I do not like rosemary. This is a constant issue for me because I wish more menus were clear about how food is prepared but,  you live & learn.  I had a reservation for an early dinner so no waiting. Yay! However, the hostess seemed awkward about the seating. But I picked a table she didn't offer & powered thru. The reason I didn't give more stars is 1. The potatoes 2. At one point there was a bug in my lemonade they served me (no apology) 3. The awkwardness of the seating. Going out is an experience as a whole,  which is how I rate. I'll definitely return as the food was delicious.",

I ordered a bloody mary before we started and it was, by far, the worst beverage I have been served in years. It was not drinkable. From there, unfortunately, things remained the same. Two of the meals we received were not described well by the waitstaff and needed to be replaced... of course after the rest of us had finished our dinner. I ordered the Chicken Zanagrelli which sounded excellent but was not executed well. The sauce was flavorful but the chicken was inedible from a consistency and flavor standpoint. When they cleared my plate they asked if I wanted a box to which I replied \"no.\"   The manager on staff that evening came over and apologized profusely for the meals that had been described incorrectly, and asked how the replacement meals were... to which one of the recipients said \"pretty good\" - now that should have been a clue that they were just being polite - a term like great or excellent would have been what they should have been listening for.    They really did try hard to fix the situation and they have lovely ambiance, but don't think this will be on the return list.",
