The food was average and not of a particularly high grade. Although there are some hit or miss items that would be worth a try. The service is very hit or miss and ranges from slightly friendly to outright rude depending on when you go. Tables may or may not be clean and you may or may not get hot food. Biggest draw here seems to be the bar and the hockey crowd after the games.",

I ordered the BBQ Pulled pork sandwich.  The meat was great, it was really tender and flavorful, my issue was with the BBQ sauce.  I know that not all BBQ sauces are sweet, but I guess that's what I was expecting...this BBQ sauce tasted more like the sauce when you make chili.  It was very much Chili powder.  I don't care for chili, so this was a total disappointment to me.  The tater tots were good but overly salted.  My husband had a cheeseburger and he said it was great.  I didn't get our servers name but he was excellent and he was covering a lot of ground so I was impressed that he made it back to our table and served up extra beer and soda.  It had a fun atmosphere and there were a lot of employees there to make things run smoothly.  I truly am giving 3 stars based on the BBQ sauce, but I will try them again some time and if the food is more to my liking, I'll up the stars.",

Took around 10 minutes for someone to realize we were there and then he took our order for drinks. Not sure if he was just quiet but definitely not engaging. So......the cleanliness....the app plates and some silverware  were all dirty, menus all nasty and even the check holder was gross. When the meals came out, 3 of 4 were dropped off with no word spoken about the missing meal. 5 minutes later it got dropped of in a driveby....really not a friendly staff at all.  The food however was really  good. Weird thing they turned the lights off over our table 3 times and we had to say something to our server. Probably won't come back.",

However I have realized the reason they may not be crowded is the horrible service and the fact that they have an event menu instead of a regular menu when there isn't a hockey game or concert going on. We sat at the bar and literally waited 30 minutes to get a food order in. All the bartenders would look at us and then not help. Looking around the restaurant most of the tables are empty and the staff has congregated around the bar not paying attention to their customers. The female bartender only seems to want to help out the male customers, we were here on November 17, in case the management truly cares about the image of this establishment.",

We both tell a server she says to the guy let me get your drink order. She never came to my table who is next to the guy. Another 10 mins go by now 30 minutes. My friend goes to find someone to take our order. Some girl comes apologizes but not sincerely. Takes out drink order. I give it to her for pretending it's not a huge deal to leave your guest unattended for 30 minutes with no water or anything!

We were going to a concert so I expected it to be busy.  Being patient when you know it's busy is one thing, but after an hour & a half, my patience was gone.  You know there's a problem when your server brings you your bill and you have to say to them, WE NEVER GOT OUR DINNER! I proceeded to seek out a manager to find our food that was M.I.A.  Our server came back and explained to us that the kitchen had managed to lose our ticket. Which had me thinking, 'Why didn't our server notice that we never got our food?' Oh, that's right..because we only saw her about once every 1/2hr!  Then we have another manager come over to our table, Chip I think, who preceded to throw our server under the bus, told us these long wait times happen (\"it is what it is\"), but threw in a few cuss words for good measure. He was extremely unprofessional, and frankly made the situation worse.  The only good thing about our experience with that they had enough sense to comp our bill, which barely made up for the fact that we ate two hours after we placed our order and missed a good 20 minutes of the concert we were going to. NEVER AGAIN",

My father had met some people and I went to the bar for a drink. Right after the bartender made my drink security approached me and asked me who I was with and I pointed to my father and told them I was with my dad. They went to get him and ushered him towards me and told us we both needed to leave.  I was completely shocked but did not argue with security and I asked the bartender for my tab, even he had a confused look on his face as I told him security was kicking us out. My father was the only African American in that bar, and I myself am half black. I will come out and say it--I have never experienced such blatant racism in my life! I also have never been kicked out of a bar! It was my father's birthday too. I flew in from Florida to so that I could spend time with my dad, and all I expected to do was to was to have a good time and make memories with him.  Well thank you Bar Louie because I will never forget this memory. I've experienced unfair treatment for being a female in a bar before, but never, EVER have I expected to be treated in such a way for the color of my skin.",

When we asked the waitress about ingredients in their current special martinis she did not know and came back with a printout of each one. After we ordered, we saw the waitress enter the drinks into the system, but then it was over 10 minutes before the bartender started making the drinks as he was wiping the entire bar first.  While watching him make the drinks he spent half of the time eating things rather than actually making our drinks. We wanted to order more drinks, but the waitress never came back to the table to check on us. I would love to visit this bar again based on their specials and menu but probably will visit any other bar in westgate because the service at Bar Louie was absolutely terrible tonight.",

She kept forgetting to bring us things we needed. When the salads didn't have dressing it took 2 trips back to the table before she remembered to bring it.

    "text": "Decided to try this place for dinner on a Friday night. Stopped in and asked the bartender behind the bar to point us in the direction to where the front is to be seated and she said it was open seating, inside and outside.   We decided to sit outside to enjoy the nice weather. However we ended up sitting outside for at least 15 minutes patiently until we got frustrated because no waitress/waiter came around. We noticed tables behind us and there was one server trying to catch up and apologizing to those tables for the delay in service. It frustrated me because we still were without waters. Finally my friend goes inside to get the attention of a staff member and a lady says she will be right out. After 5 minutes of waiting, (I think that's long enough) no one still comes out. We sat for another 5 minutes until I went in. I went in to the bar waiting for help but no bartender was on that side and I had noticed 4 staff members on the other side talking to each other. I didn't want to be rude but I went and asked if someone could come service us as it's been a long time now. One girl says she will be right out.   She comes out and asks for our orders. Now I'm not sure if we were her table or her section or how it works or if she just decided to come help us, but she brought no waters with.   We both ordered a drink and I placed an order for an entree. The drinks took a while to come out but surprisingly the food was brought over to me right after she placed down our drinks. That was kind of scary. I ordered the voodoo pasta that came with noodles, shrimp, sausages, and bell peppers. The pasta was cold but I was starving so I ate it. It wasn't bad but it lacked flavor and it came out way too quick.   Water refills came so I am thankful for that but it took her a long time to bring the check, to pick up the check, and to bring back the check.   Note to self: should have checked the reviews on this place before coming! Most likely will not be back again",

    "text": "Horrible experience at this location and we love the Tempe location. We stopped in for a drink and a quick bite before the Mercy Me concert. We talked to the hostess at 530. She took our name/number and said it would be about a 20 min wait. We received a text only 9 minutes later so we were happy about that. We quickly ordered two lemon martinis, and two iced teas. She told us there was no happy hour. I'm assuming they screw you on concert nights, because according to their sign on the table we were there within the time frame of their normal HH. The menu also only had like 15 items on it. I'm assuming, again, that this is because of the event. Anyway, we ordered two classic flatbread pizza, the Cajun pasta, and a burger. We placed the order at 546. At 643pm, we still had no food. The concert started at 7. The waitress, Amanda, claimed the kitchen lost a bunch of tickets. She then said she didn't know how much longer it would take and asked if we wanted to cancel our order. Seriously? We've been here an hour and need to eat! Two tables around us left. I asked to speak to a manager.  While waiting for him, one flatbread arrived. Even though we ordered two of the same thing. The manager came out, but looked to maybe just be a kitchen manager?? He was clueless and said he didn't know what happened to cause our order to be on separate ticket, but to give him a few more minutes. He said he comp the food. Well I would hope so! The drinks should have been comped too for the inconvenience!  10 min later, the burger came out with a veggie flatbread, which we didn't order, so they had to go back and get another classic flatbread. My daughter still didn't have her pasta. At 714 her pasta arrived. She had to shovel it down since we were already late for the concert. Completely ridiculous. We attend many concerts and games up there and there are many choices of where to spend our money. We won't spend it here.",

But then I got the Watermelon Fizz to copy Transter and instantly lost because that thing was too tart to drink.  It was so tart that it was almost to the point of bitterness.  Our waitress, Crystal, gave us some sugar to try and help but it couldn't be done.  I legit had a full untouched glass on the table and was still charged the $5.  Darn.  At least the food and company was good.  I had gone with the Pear & Blue Cheese Salad and Tran got the Loaded Tots.  These plates were huge and we ended up sharing our plates.  The cheesy hot goodness from the tots with the pickled jalapenos paired surprisingly well with the sweetness and fresh taste of the salad while the blue cheese gave everything a little funk.  I enjoyed myself.  We couldn't finish either of the plates since they were so generous with their portions either but we picked away at both plates while spinning two nearby Pokestops while laughing insanely over Pokemons that kept running away. We're nerds.  We want to pop into Bar Louie again for some good eats.  $5 burgers on Tuesdays from 5pm-close? Aw yeah!   As a side-note:  I can't remember if we got the 15% off our bill.  Oh well!",

    "text": "I absolutely love the food here, from healthy crisp salads to bacon and cheese covered loaded tots, the food here is GREAT bar food. Food here is QUALITY AND QUANTITY. Great foods to go with wines and beers, by the way, if you have a late group you can order cocktails by the pitcher. YAS!  My favorite salad has to be the Blue Cheese and Pear Salad, great pairings of pear and blue cheese and walnuts and cranberries. Another favorite item on the menu of mine is The Fried Louie burger, a cheeseburger with a fried egg!  They definitely have great happy hours, especially on Tuesday, 5pm-close, you can grab a burger and either tots or fries, for only $5.00! That's a deal you can't miss out on.  The only downfall and the only reason why I docked two stars is because I've been here so many times, and every time, the service here disappoints me in some way. I understand that it is a place where you seat yourself, but every single time I come here, I have to wave down a waiter to take out order after waiting about 10-15 mins. I'm very understanding when the say \"sorry about the wait\" but 3-4 times out of 5 that I've been? That's a bit much, and it's usually not even that busy when I come by. Even after ordering, service is so slow. Every time something is needed, it's given to my table when it's not needed anymore or when we've already finished our food. It'd be so much more enjoyable if the staff was more quick and attentive to the customer.  Eh, at least the food is good though, I'll be back for that, not the service.",

This bar is located in an area called the entertainment district. Yet when there is real entertainment, at either the arena, or the stadium, they don't honor their standard weekday evening happy hour pricing. They basically assume tey will be busy, so they can screw over the crow that wants a quick meal before a concert or game.  Here's a novel idea: how about you show them a great time, at a great price, and maybe they will come back when there is not an event. Playing games like this won't win customers over.

To be honest I think they didn't want to serve a party of 6 and would rather do nothing at work. This is exactly why westgate will always be the last place people choose to go. If you work in the customer service business you would think they would want to treat customers right instead and build business so customers come back but that is not the case for this place.

The food was phenomenal and the drinks were just as equally amazing. It is really beautiful inside and service is awesome. They have a big menu full of great food and creative drinks. I hope they can keep the quality. It seems that when new restaurants start here they end up not being as good as when they first opened only months later. Very excited to see what comes of this place. I loved my first visit so far. The pineapple sangria is to die for. I will be back no doubt!",

I ordered the Louie sandwich which was dry and little to no flavor to it. My wife ordered the beef brisket sliders. Those where actually really good. They had a nice smokey flavor with a little kick to the sauce. Oh I almost forgot about the house salad. It was ok as well. Dressing was over powering the lettuce and not that many cucumbers but alot of carrots. So overall I would give them a three and a half stars.",

Thanks to all the other stuff on the sandwich I didn't notice it at first and ate some of this chicken!   I alerted the server who told his manager. The manager came by to tell me he had not charged me for the sandwich and offer a dessert (as if more food from that kitchen was a good idea). He also said it shouldn't have happened since they cut their sandwiches in half. Agreed. It shouldn't have happened. You know what else shouldn't have happened? I shouldn't have had to pay a single dime for that dinner.   I emailed the restaurant to tell them what happened  and didn't receive a response. My sister sent them a pic of my sandwich using their Facebook page and still no response. Clearly they don't care.   I could have really gotten sick. They need to clean that place up before someone really gets hurt.",

The waitress came up and told us after we had been waiting 25 minutes that it was going to be another 25 minutes because the kitchen was backed up. We found that kind of interesting because there was not that many people there at 9 o'clock at night. Then the manager finally came out and apologized and he told us that the grill was too small and they can only do a few burgers at a time, it was $5 burger night. Why weren't they prepared? He offered 25% off - my husband and his friend were extremely nice and accepted that. I did not think that was enough! We had three kids with us who hadn't eaten dinner yet & they did not even offer to bring out something munchy to eat before our food came i.e. chips and salsa?!  They brought our food, mind you the four adults got our food right away, the kids had to wait another 10 minutes. We were finished within 15-20 minutes, then had to wait another 45 minutes to get our check. Insane! The manager Mike came over and was happy go lucky and thought he offered the world by giving us 25% off - I told him that it wasn't enough and he offered to open reopen the checks, but by 10 o'clock - all I wanted to do was to go home. It took extremely way too long and they did not offer any compensation for something that they made a mistake with. A restaurant should not hold customers hostage to get food on a Tuesday night at 8 - 9 o'clock and then be stingy about compensation! (then to top it off - we talk to another waitress and she told us the truth that they were shortstaffed! Appreciate a manager lying to us!) My family and I will never return to this restaurant nor will we ever recommend because of the service and how we were treated. (And I have two boys that play hockey - we are at Gila River all the time! Lots of hockey friends!)",

Tried the Mac n cheese w chicken it was ok as well. Service was average. Think the waiter was a little flustered by a large table. Had a hard time keeping up with all the drinks. The beer glasses sat empty quite a while. This was our first time will probably give it another try during a happy hour when prices are alittle less.",

Every restaurant was crowded so we ended up on the patio in 110 degree weather. The misters above our table were broken. The waiter didn't come by for about 10 minutes to take our drink order. The place was a shit show. I don't know what was going on but they ran out of silverware, cups, etc. It took an HOUR AND A HALF to get our food from the time we sat down. I'm normally very patient but I was starting to lose it. I was hot and didn't want to be late for the show. Food finally came and it was not good. BBQ salad had wilted lettuce and was just blah. The spicy honey chicken sandwich was ok but the chicken was really tough. But we were starving at this point and basically shoved it down our throats and got out of there at 6:50pm. I'm not sure if 10 of their employees called out sick today or if it was some horrible fluke but it was a pretty bad experience. The one redeeming quality was that our waiter was very nice. I felt bad for him because none of it was his fault.",

Still waiting quite awhile for our draft beers they came to us just at a state of cool.  The food was mediocre and the server was more worried about making sure we knew there was an up charge for the ranch dressing that was needed for the dry chicken sandwich.   Slow service can be understandable when busy but not when there are only a few tables occupied.  Once we made the decision that we will more than likely not be returning and quick trip to the restroom was made, the lights shut off while in the stall.  My overall experience here just was not one I would like to experience again.",

Who the fuck wants to eat a three inch piece of green onion?  Fuckin nobody.   The waitress rudely told me to look at the menu when I asked about ipas. Then two of the ipas I asked for that weren't sell out craft were out.  Well get a pen and scratch them off the menu if it's that difficult for you to name five ipas.   The bathrooms were filthy and out of paper towels. The bar was stacked with dirty glasses. Take that shit in the back and wash it. Customers don't want to see that shit. We are talking a Saturday afternoon and the place is half empty. I don't want to ever experience this place when they are busy. One waitress was stalking our table while the other one tried to fight her off. Really weird. She reminded me of a kid trying to sell chicle and not giving up.   Possibly the third worse whiskey sour I've had in my life.   Will never come back here. Fuckin westgate sucks.",

There is a big sign that says they serve food the entire time they are open...not True.  We sat outside for 20 min. before tracking down a server. I had overheard that they were closing the restaurant early and I wanted to get a food order in. She was kind enough to take our order. 15 min later we received the srinks we ordered. 40 min after we ordered our food, we hear the cook come out and yell at the waitresses saying that what we ordered was it available....it took 40 min to tell them that?!?! So, we changed our order. The hamburger sliders were terrible and the fried onion rings were so soggy. The nachos were just ok. Now, this is not the waitresses fault!! She was great. But none of the tables were being bussed, food was not being ran and even when a glass was broken she still received no help on a full patio. Very poor management decisions!!  It started with understaffing and ended with a manager who obviously chose not to manage.  The 2 stars is becaus of the waitresses hard work and the potential the bar/restaurant may have on a not so busy night.",

So we grabbed our own table, which was filthy.  My wife and I order a whiskey sour. Very disgusting concoction of sweet pink juice mixed in with a weak tasting whiskey. On with the appetizer. The chips trio consisted of stale chips, and cheese/salsa/guacamole from a jar. On with the food. We ordered fish and chips. Not sure what type of fish it was since the menu didn't list it. Aside from the thick and greasy coating the fish was good however the fries were barely warm. Only one other person in my party received their food while two others waited and waited and waited for theirs. Finally we asked our server about the missing food. The expression on his face was of  \"what, you other people ordered food too\". Then he rushed off to the kitchen in search of it. Finally he came back with the missing dishes. If this was a a restaurant that just opened for business I could understand the lack of confusion that took place that night, but really not the case here.  Dear Manager: at least spend a few extra bucks for a sign that says \"Seat Yourself \".  I won't be going back to this place.",

Our waitress left mid order to tend to another table???  When we finally got our food orders, food was fine but we were all dry in the drink department. Asking for the check was another hassle. Talked to manager and got our dinner on the house. I shouldn't complain but we found out our waitress was new. Not her fault.

    "text": "We went to this place last night and I was not happy with our visit. With the exception of the guy  playing guitar and the bartender this place certainly deserves the neg reviews on here. For starters this place was not busy AT ALL yet  when we sat down we were never greeted or even acknowledged. And when they did look at us it was obvious they didn't want us in there at least that's how I felt. No smiles, \"hey how are you\" or anything. So after 20 minutes or so we gave up on the tables and went right to the bar. We ordered the nachos which were dry. I don't think the cooks really take passion in their work at least that's what the nachos showed. Not to mention that the girl who brought us our food couldn't even ask us if we needed anything else or even look at us for that matter. She turned around and walked away while I was asking for more napkins. The music wasn't that loud so I know she heard me. After we got our food and drinks we didn't get any other attention after that. There are plenty of bars at Westgate do yourself a favor and skip this one. Every other bar we went to the people greeted us, served us with a smile and were more than happy to take our money.  September 2017 Update: I haven't been on yelp for a while but I just seen this review from myself at the end of 2016 and I remember that night. By the most recent reviews I see nothing has changed. Bar Louie! You need to train your staff better. You need to hold people accountable and heads need to roll for their lack of customer service because this bar obviously doesn't have it. I don't know how you people stay in business. Don't say that that's not what your company is about. Bad customer service is what your company is about considering you've done nothing to change it.",

    "text": "Strap yourself in,  this is an in depth review because we just left.  Not good, in a kind of shrug your shoulders and sigh kind of way. Walked in,  place was a buzz, cool vibe and nice decor. You seat yourself which I like. Sat down and a bar manager immediately greeted us,  taking our drink order and suggesting a bruscheta appetizer. Seemed like a good start,  I didn't even mind the 20+ dirty drink glasses perched on the bar top facing customers-those should definitely be placed lower our behind the bar-out of sight of they're going to hang out for over 30 minutes. Bruscheta came  out before the drinks,  two other servers had stopped by to get our drink orders because the manager forgot to lay down cocktail napkins,  letting the other servers know we had been helped.  They seemed annoyed by that. The bruscheta was ok,  served in a huge martini glass. Overly salted, would have benefited from the removal of the iceberg and the addition of a basalmic. Husband ordered an old fashioned and I ordered a one of their virgin specialties-the mango drink.  Took 15 minutes to come out,  then,  the server accidently spilled my drink on me- she apologized and even when I returned to the table room a trip to the restroom to clean up,  the server was still waiting for someone to come worth a mop.  They don't seem to have a policy for a cleanup in place because everyone was confused. The cup was left on the table,  and a replacement came out ten minutes later.  I tasted it,  very very bland like a can of mango juice with some lemon lime. His drink was ok,  nothing special. Food came out, his pasta was overly seasoned,  basic sauce. My fried louie was cooked to a crisp and clearly not made in house. Fried egg and bacon were good,  but the underlying grossness of the meat tainted everything,  greasy and a hint of freezer burn. The tots were nice and crisp. I let the server know the burger wasn't good,  she was empathetic, this was clearly not the first time she's heard it-she said she was sorry that this experience was a 'total, epic failure.' She offered to bring me something else but my husband was just about finished and I didn't want to spend more time waiting so I declined. Manager did come over,  I expressed my suggestions about the drink and food- he was well aware, said that he thinks the drinks should be sweeter on the mango and watermelon, but shrugged it off. He did offer a dessert, but again,  I was turned off and declined. I was surprised to see the appetizer comped,  that was a   cool thing to do. Clearly the main issue lies in training and quality control.  Maybe we'll be back, I did see a couple at the bar send back what looked like lemon drops, so it was more than a single drink issue,  I really wanted it to be a good new spot. Please feel free to message me,  and I will be happy to even further elaborate.",

The dips served along were honey mustard, queso and cinnamon butter (I know, I know...but it was surprisingly wonderful).  And, for our entrees, hubby got the mac & cheese sandwich w/pulled pork and tater tots.  He devoured it!  Hmmmm, I think he liked it.  I got the Backyard BBQ burger and tater tots.  The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked, it had cheese, bbq sauce and onion straws on it...so good!  And, don't judge me, I asked for no bacon (which is part of the burger), and it came just as I asked.  Our waiter, Mike, was friendly and attentive.  Plus, he actually remembered us from a different restaurant, which we hadn't been to in a long time.  So, it was like bumping into an old friend.  The restaurant is really big (inside and out), there are 2 bars and they have live music on Thursday nights.  It was comfortable and spacious...you don't feel cramped inside.  We're already looking forward to going back again!",

I ordered the pear and blue cheese salad, and they did follow instructions to put the cheese, dressing, and balsamic glaze on the side. The salad itself was good, with plenty of pecans, delicious glaze, pears, and cheese, but I was underwhelmed by the chicken. I was expecting fresh grilled chicken on my salad, but it was cold, old, sad chicken, presumably from the night before(as they had just opened for the day, it was clearly not freshly prepared). All in all, I'll give the place another shot, perhaps for date night. Their menu looks like it has a nice selection.",

I have to say since returning numerous times in the past nine months I have seen a big change. Their food has always been delicious, but more recently it's also reached me promptly. There is also a top notch bartender that always takes care of me and whoever I am with. Ned is the mixologist to talk to. He is fast, efficient, and knowledgeable. Frankly, his service is the reason why I bumped them up to four stars.   If they didn't give me a bad first impression for so long it would of been five stars, but their improvements in staff and ticket times for food has changed my mind. I would recommend this place to a friend.",

    "text": "Decided to try this place before the Queen concert. Since it's in Westgate and directly across from the arena where the show was, they had an \"event menu\" which also coincided with happy hour. This menu was a scaled down version of the full one, which they were displaying outside for passers by to peruse.  Seated ourselves, as the hostess said it was open seating. I noticed it was happy hour, which included select appetizers, so I asked our server about which items were included in the happy hour and she said they all were since it was an event menu. We ordered based on what she said and the food was rather good. Two different flavors of traditional wings (buffalo and asian), lettuce wraps, a hummus plate, a cheese quesadilla, and a couple side salads, along with drinks.   When our server brought the bill, I looked over it and realized only one food item was marked down for happy hour. I asked our server about it, she went and checked, and returned saying only the quesadilla, boneless wings, and one other thing were included in the happy hour. I was surprised by this and questioned her, but all she said was \"I'm sorry\".   She made no effort to compensate for her complete lack of knowledge of the menu at all. Had we known about the very limited selection, we would have ordered completely differently. I would have liked to speak to a manager, but due to time constraints we just paid the bill and left.   The food was good, the atmosphere was solid, but the service left much to be desired, and that's what lead me to give this place 3 stars. Will I return? Possibly, now that I know the hyper limited happy hour menu, but there are many other restaurant options in the same area, so we'll see.",

It is a large restaurant with outdoor seating if you care to brave the heat this time of year.  We have been to Bar Louie a number of times and have been absolutely thrilled with the quality of the food and the service.   They have ten hamburger selections, including a Spiked Bulleit Bourbon Burger that you have to be 21 to eat.   I have had the Fried Louie, which has bacon, cheddar and eggs and served with fries or tots. The burger was beautifully cooked and the richness of the egg adds an awesome component.  The Louie Burger is a must for the Midwest folks, as it has grilled onion, Provolone and spicy giardiniera--a flavor explosion!  They are not just a burger place, but that is what draws me here.   The service has always been spot on and the place is clean. The ambiance is more toward the higher end of casual eateries, and costs a little more as well. With all the other things going on at Westgate, it is just fun to be here.  They are not perfect however. Their Happy Hour menu is unclear at best. They could really tighten that up.  Also, you need to be aware if there is an event happening at either of the arenas. All the restaurants in what I call Westgate proper (surrounding the fountain) serve reduced menus when there is something happening that will draw large crowds.  To end on a positive note: Tuesday they have $5 burgers from 5-close (except the spiked bourbon burger). Gotta love that!",

    "text": "My sister and I went to Bar Louie while visiting Westgate for the first time. I loved the wide open doors and the option for a variety of seating (outdoor, indoor and bar seating). We sat at the bar. The bar is nice and has little funny statements written in chalk where the alcohol bottles are kept. One of them was \"alcohol won't solve your problems, but neither will milk!\" Our Bartender Alex was Amazing! He was very nice and can make a mean drink!  My sister ordered a whiskey drink that wasn't on the menu and asked that it not be too sweet. He made a great drink and even added some fresh basil for extra flavor and flair! I ordered a gin drink, also not on the menu and asked that it include lemon. He did not dissapoint and made a lemonade type drink with fresh mint. It was so good..and pretty too! I enjoyed his creativity and fun personality. We also ordered their hummus app for a snack and the pesto hummus was my favorite! Super flavorful! My sister and I are visiting from out of state but I would definitely go back if I was in the area again and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Westgate!",

After about 15 minutes with no server, we finally had a waitress and ordered beers during happy hour and put in our food order as well. Happy hour ended at 6 so we ordered a second round before it ended but our server didn't get them entered so we paid full price, which is annoying.  There were 4 of us and we didn't order anything elaborate: 2 $5 burgers, a flatbread and the fish. It took well over an hour to receive our food. Luckily, our waitress was paying attention and sent out a chips and queso appetizer because she noticed how long it had been. The menu states burgers come out medium I think? My friend's burger was definitely rare to the point of undercooked. Mine was perfect because I asked for it medium well.  Our total visit time was almost 2.5 hours which was excruciating but that's the way it goes. My food was great.",

We ordered 2 lemon drop martinis...one was nowhere near the amount of drink as the other. We asked the bartender for a re-pour. She copped an attitude with us and the new drink came out in more liquid, but she just poured juice in it. Never apologized, just kept glaring at us, while she played on her cell phone.   Waitress never came back to the table for us to order food. Buser took our payment so we could actually leave. Waitress said a \"staff meeting\" prevented her from attending to us.  Bad experience all around.  Skip this place.",

Ordered a Festivus Sangria, which I was happy to find out does NOT have citrus in it, since citrus allergies permit me from having regular Sangrias, Mimosas, or anything else made with oranges, lemons, limes, or grapefruits.   The Festivus Sangria was a Christmas holiday drink that Bar Louie has carried over & I'm happy they did. It was SO tasty! My friend & I each had one. The drink features Old Apple Orchard, Argutura (sp?) Bitters, Cinnamon, cherries, etc. I can't remember all the ingredients but do remember how delicious it was & I'd totally order it again!   Another friend met us there & we all enjoyed a drink, the ambience, the atmosphere of the place, & how relaxing it was. Our bartender was awesome & checked on us a lot.  The ONLY drawback was the customer a couple stools over ordered something so strong & full of citrus, as I mentioned before that I'm allergic to, & loaded with strawberries, which my friend is allergic to. The bartender made the drink then & there & that was our cur it was time to head out, being us ladies were having allergic reactions.  I will go back next time in the area (perhaps after a Coyotes game).",

We saw Yard House and we decided to go in. It was extremely full. They told us the wait was 45 minutes.....and we had to wait outside. We took the pager but we decided to walk around and look at other options. We saw this place, we hadn't heard of it and I had not Yelped it. My husband went in and asked about the wait, they said no wait and you may sit anywhere you'd like. I almost ran back to the other place. I went and returned the pager. We were very happy to be out of the cold. Our waitress was very pleasant and my husband and I immediately ordered some drinks. I ordered an orange mule it was very refreshing and sweet. I enjoyed a couple lol. My husband ordered his usual (he's not adventurous) he had a vodka tonic. For dinner I picked an appetizer, the shrimp lettuce wraps which our waitress recommended. They were delicious! Spicy and served with a spicy mustard and a sweet sauce on the side. It was a delightful mixture of flavors and I enjoyed it very much. I couldn't finish it , it was filling. We will definitely think of coming back here.",

Came in with some coworkers and it took at least half an hour to get our appetizers. Our server had tables across the restaurant and had to rush back and forth. Took him ages to refill our drinks and get beers to the table. We also split the bill and instructed him what card to charge more on and he charged the wrong card...   *There was one girl barking at customers \"You have two minutes to finish your drinks and food until we close\" and rushed off to complain to her coworkers that she has to work late. Don't work somewhere that is opened late and complain about it. The only reason why this place still has foot traffic is because it's in such a popular location. What is with the open seating in such a large space and the limited amount of servers working? No wonder why people are so against returning back to this establishment.",

The bartender was super nice and said she's refunding my money. Not sure if it will actually go through; I was so sad/hungry/tired at this point that I left with my sorry excuse for a burger. Have to tell my coworkers not to do our next big meet up here: we have anywhere from 20-50 people and drop 1-3 thousand a visit. Glad I learned my lesson for under $20 and can steer people away!

It seem like a cool place we didn't spend much time here we got a quick drink before we headed home. We are greeted quickly and we were able to sit out on the outside patio where we can watch water show display is located in the center of the complex. It was a little bit hot out on the patio but we chose to sit there anyway. The beers were good the menu is fairly simple. The biggest downside to this place was that the music was turned up way too loud. The music was not coming from this restaurant fortunately but it was loud enough next door or we could not hear each other speak. Next time I think will sit inside I'll have to get something off the menu to get the full experience of this place. I guess it's just me getting older but the bars really do need to turn down the music is uncomfortable and super annoying to have to lean over every 2 seconds to understand a conversation.",

We ordered the food and after an hour and ten minutes, we left after leaving a small gratuity for our waiter.  Bottom line, if Bar Louie is unable to handle the volume of food requests, then they need to rethink their hours on a concert night.  We never received our food order and left to go to the concert, without having eaten since breakfast.  If you cannot wait over an hour to be served your order, don't go to Bar Louie!!",

    "text": "It's unfortunate when I love a places food but the service is so poor that it affects 1) how I feel about the restaurant and 2) the frequency of my visits. So let's start with the pros:  -upper scale bar food (pretzals with sweet dipping butter, amaaaazing calamari) -indoor/outdoor seating with heaters -seat yourself  and now the cons:  -looooong wait for food/drinks -seat yourself (also a con as well as a pro because sometimes waiters don't notice you) -some outdoor seats aren't heated well enough by the heaters   In the times we have went we have waited a massive amount of time for one appetizer, another time we waited at least 20 minutes for a drink and for them to even take our food order. The outside seats can be great or terribly cold depending on where the table is placed and the wind. That hasn't knocked down stars for me, it was simply the wait time. We go to Westgate all the time and food/bar hop and the other restaurants do not have that problem with under staffing. The very last time we went and we had told the waitress that 20 minutes was rather long to wait for ONE drink, she said it was a bartender in training. I feel like Saturday night at peak time would be when they would have a \"seasoned\" bartender and the training bartender \"assisting\" not RUNNING the bar but maybe the waitress was just making an excuse. Either way we will be back because of the awesome food but I've come to expect a massive wait for service.",

    "text": "Update!! Was messaged on YELP to message the manager via Facebook to address the below complaint. Messaged her two days after this review. Guess what, no response. Looking at their page, they just went down and found the reviews for that day, messaged everyone who left a bad review to make Bar Louie look responsive, then moved the bad reviews to below better reviews. They were just bad before, now they appear manipulative, if not actively managing their business in bad faith.   Atrocious. Horrible. Bleedingly slow. Excuses. Manager and four servers incompetent. Ass hanging out of the servers shorts...appetizer? No, disgusting and sloppy. All open seating. But no server support. We had to track down a server, who basically said \"huh? Is this my section.\" (*adjust shorts\") manager came over, basically did his version of a Scooby Doo impression, and said, welp, it's busy, I have two hour ticket times, it is what it is. What a joke. Other locations are on point. This was total a joke. Here was the timeline, sat, 15 min no server, at 20 min went to get our own drinks at the bar, at 30 min ordered appetizers and drinks, at 45 minutes (without receiving our server drinks) we got out second round from the bar, at an hour, we started wondering where the eff our server was (who we found tending to her ONE other table...(she's ambitious)), at 1:15 (still no food) start freaking the eff out, 1:30 in, complain to server and says, tee hee *adjust shorts, I'll tell the manager, 1;45 food arrives. 2:00, manager LEAVES THE BUILDING! Server says here is ur bill and we leave. Eff this places go to yard house.",

We asked our server to check for our apps ONLY after 30 min and her response is what annoyed me the most and hence the review.  She says its really busy and how long was it, oh only 30, should be like 45 min at least.  At 45 min she realized we still didn't have anything and went back and it appeared.  Funny she REFUSED to check before.  Really?  Not to mention first drink was awful, asked for simple syrup to help it.  Then needed to order another, we paid for it, which is fine but not even asked about.  Plus paying the bill took forever and people wanted our seat!  So bad service, bad drinks, food too long.  I'd avoid.  Wish we waited in line at Yard House probably would have took less time and been better.",

We came with a large party (9 people which I understand can be more challenging) and never received something as simple as water.

The management created excuses about technology and never came over to offer a simply apology. The way this was handled was as immature as my lead in to this review. Unless your goal is to complain and get a discounted meal for poor service (which will be probable with this restaurant), save your appetite for a restaurant with a better experience.",

We wandered in here one evening for a drink and a snack. It was good food, but a bit on the pricey side for what it was. They said they have a scratch kitchen and I don't doubt it, but a bit more creativity would have been nice. We had fish and chips, figuring that that's always a good way to test a new place. These were pretty good fish and chips but nothing that really set them apart from the usual.

We grabbed menus (they are on the table) they were GROSS with food stuffs smooshed on the pages (looked as if they had never been wiped at all) don't know why, but we ordered anyway (they have appetizer plates stacked on the table) went to hand my daughter one and as I lifted it it kind of stuck to the one under it and OH BOY there was a dirty (I think chocolate cake) plate  it had not even been attempted to be washed.

The plus here is that it's an open/airy spot, great location in Westgate.   Questionable if we will return.",

My sister (who is 28 years old and had to wait OUTSIDE because she didn't have her ID to just drink water) had ordered macaroni and cheese and waited outside for 45 minutes. When we got back to the hotel, part of the order was not there, and the food we DID receive was cold. It was apparent it had been siting under a lukewarm heat lamp for several minutes until we had to ASK a bartender where our order was. Thankfully, we live in Tucson and will not be returning. There are plenty of great options on the University of Arizona campus that can accommodate for such an apparent difficult task. Extremely disappointed!",

I was so impressed. My Fried Louie Burger  was beautifully assembled. Great optics! However, what won me over was how juicy the medium well burger was. The sunnyside up egg just added more moisture to the fabulous burger. I couldn't finish the tator tots. You can't beat this great deal!  My daughter got the Salmon Sliders. The Salmon was marinated well and moist.  I will be back on another Tuesday!",

This is accompanied by some pretty good drink specials too.  We sat on the spacious patio that wraps around the west side of the restaurant. It is a great seat and incorporates you into the vibe of Westgate.   The menu has a ton of offerings and fits about everyone's taste. The cocktails are well derived and this is a fun place to host a party or office happening. Located near the Coyotes home makes it a great stop before the game. Don't forget the Cardinals are just up the street as well. For the non-sports fan, Cabela's is just across the street to the north and the outlet malls are located to the west.  I like Bar Louie because it is very casual, kid friendly and located in an area that lends to fun and excitement with hustle and people watching. Trust me, you will see some serious characters here! So, if hanging on this side of Central, come and check out the diggs!  #barlouie #westgate #irishcatv2 #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

She made sure we were having g a good time and checked on us frequently even though it was pretty busy. The food was great! With the suggestion from Corita, I had the \"impossible burger\" which is a plant based party meat substitute and it was amazing! Could t even tell it wasn't real meat! We also split a basket of bourbon bbq wings as an app and they were perfect! There are not enough great things to say about this place, I will absolutely be back, and if you go, ask for Corita!!

Our waiter was pleasant, pretty attentive but we did have to ask for refills on our drinks in between his visits.  The wait for food was a tad long for the crowd. Our food came out fresh but it was not cooked as ordered (Medium was Well and Medium rare was Medium). Even my egg was cooked a little long. Still tasted good enough to eat. Tots portion for my plate were plentiful but fries for my companion were in a cup and not quite a handful in portion size.  Over all I felt that I could have received the same quality if not a tad bit better from Carl's Jr.  The bad of it is, I brought a newbie in, and had talked it up and for our visit to be... meh, I'm only giving BL a 3 star review.

Unfortunately, other than some of the food being ok, the rest of the experience was poor at best. Our waiter never came to the table and when he finally did to take our orders he came back 10 minutes later only to tell us that he'd forgotten our orders and hadn't put anything in yet - not to mention we had two impatient toddlers with us. The food overall was ok, some things were cold but the taste/execution was fine hence the only two stars I'm giving this place. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone.",

Was cut off after three beers which four of my friends had all because the waitress didn't feel comfortable serving them drinks. I had sangria that was filled with more ice than the drink itself. This was all after three gigantic chicken nachos, pot stickers, 12 waters, and not to mention the 15-20 minutes it took for her to bring the alcoholic drinks. We got there early to catch up and talk spent four hours there only because our food and drinks took forever. Went to this place because Salt gave me and the others food poisoning the last time but service and attitude from Cara was not worth it. Suspiciously we were cut off once they started to pick up business. Never going back there again due to terrible customer service and the wait time for food.",

The food has always been fantastic, never any complaints with that. And for the most part, the staff have been friendly and accommodating.   But I gotta say, management really needs to get it together.  They have NO system in place for seating. The hostess station consists of a table and a piece of paper.   Many times when we've come to the restaurant there has been no wait and the hostess would walk us to any random table (it didn't seem like she had any sort of plan, just wandered aimlessly to an empty table) and asked if it was okay. Other times staff would just shout \"come in, sit anywhere you'd like\".  And all these times it was fine.  We had to wait a while for service or for food before,  but nothing too terrible.    But if there is ever a wait at this restaurant? Forget about it. You should probably just go somewhere else that's more organized.  They won't be able to give you an estimated wait time, and no buzzer to let you know when it's your turn. I honestly feel bad for the hostess who has to just handle it without any support, and no organization, no real system to use for prioritizing seating, etc.  Bottom line, you'll probably like the food, but don't come here if you're in any sort of hurry. I would also suggest avoiding weekends or busy dinner hours.",

This restaurant has never failed to please my palate. They plate beautifully and really elevate the experience with their astute sauce and garnish choices.

(They compare sticky chicken or seafood) But it took FOREVER to get our food. We saw a couple that came in before us that had ordered their food to go at the same time as us and you could tell that she was getting annoyed with the wait time because she kept asking the waiter how long. Of course it was hot inside they were utilizing swamp fans to cool the inside it felt.   Once we got the food it was good but the dip was cold which it should if been hot.

The service this past Saturday with \"Clara\" was very good, even though it was a busy day at Westgate due to a Rattler's Playoff game at the Arena. (The service the previous visit was just ok, as our waiter disappeared for a while, even though we had indicated we were ready to order and that we wanted to eat before the game). Each time we were seated promptly and were welcomed by our servers, who were prompt with the drink orders. The food is actually very well prepared and exceeded my expectations.   Even though the name of the business might cause one to think that it is a bar that happens to sell food, from my perspective it is actually a good restaurant that also has a bar. I realize that comment may sound confusing, but what I'm saying is it's not just \"bar food\".   The alcoholic drinks are a little on the pricy side, and the mixed drinks that I ordered appeared to be a little light on the alcohol - especially for the price. The flavor was ok, they just were a little lacking on the alcoholic content, from my perspective.   The *hit and miss\" service and the price and quality of the drinks knocks my review down from what otherwise would be 5 stars. But all things considered, Bar Louie is definitely a solid option for dining at Westgate. We will certainly be back!",

I didn't care for the ahi poke. It was literally coleslaw with a couple of pieces of ahi on top BUT the rest of the food was super tasty. I had the pulled pork sandwich and ladies and gentlemen, I ate the whole thing! Atmosphere seems super chill. Staff is very welcoming. They have a couple churro items on the menu which seem very interesting and I will be checking them out next time. There will be a next time.  The effen good martini was \"F'ing good\"! Great overall experience. Glad I ended up there for my birthday lunch!",

First of all they gave our group a whole small room on the side with our own servers. And they did an excellent job making sure everyone was able to get whatever they wanted. The selection of wine, beer and mixed drinks is nice and the HH prices making drinking too much an easy thing to do.  The flatbread pizzas are also great with a variety that will suit almost anyone's taste. When the clock struck 5, the 1/2 price burgers started and several of our group ordered up. Like the usual upscale burger, the initial problem was, how do you get that thing in your mouth ? But needless to say, it gets done and everyone was happy. Certainly a place the group will go back to and certainly should be tried if you like good drinks, food and service at a great price.",

A neighboring brunch spot had an extended wait list so my husband and I chose to start our day here for some mimosas. As advertised they are 'bottomless' however they only allow 5 per guest. We decided on chilaquiles and baked French toast. Both delicious and just the right amount to share between two people.  We arrived fairly early and were seated right away. They were only staffed with 3 employees in the front of the house. Within the hour business picked up, and I thought their wait staff continued to do a great job with tending to all their tables and making sure our drinks were always filled! I only gave this location 4 stars because of the temperature inside of the restaurant, it was very warm. They had 3 large fans inside that took awhile to circulate around the entire restaurant.",

    "text": "If you are unfamiliar with Bar Louie, may I ask why? Bar Louie has locations near two popular destinations in the valley (Westgate and Tempe Marketplace) and they have great visibility. While I have been to both, this review is for the West Valley location.  Because of the proximity to Gila River Arena (it's right across the plaza) I've dined at Bar Louie on many occasions. Recently, I grabbed a late lunch before a Coyotes game with some season ticket friends. They are regulars here and it shows.  Our server, Michelle, knows them by name and even seemed familiar with their usual orders. She did a great job being around, making suggestions and dealing with our motley group and sense of humor. Kudos to her!  One consistency I've noticed at each Bar Louie, is the cleanliness. Fortunately for them, it's typically busy. Fortunately for us, the staff does a great job keeping it spotless. Bar Louie looks like a classy place from the outside, and luckily, it is equally classy on the inside too. The atmosphere is fun, festive and laid back. In other words, it does a great job of not feeling like an ordinary sports bar.  The menu reads like a typical pub and grub, but in reality, the ingredients are higher quality and the food is prepared really well. I've dined at nearly every restaurant at Westgate. Bar Louie is one of a very few that I would be happy to eat at again and again.  Now go find the Bar Louie closest to you and smack yourself for not trying it sooner.",

Maybe he had a rough day, but whatever the case, we felt the brunt end of it.   The burgers though, they tasted as good as we'd remembered. That part I cannot complain about. We'll give Bar Louie another try, and hopefully end up with a server on par with our first few visits.",

We went last night after the Rattler vs Soul Arena Bowl championship because getting into Salt (the planned after party locale) was over an hour to get inside.  I liked the decor and truly thought this would be a fun place for dinner and drinks for a group of 10.  We were seated quickly - should have been a sign - and given three menus for 10 people.  After 20 minutes, we finally had somebody come to take a drink order. It wasn't that bad as we were all chatting and having a good time with each other so we didn't notice.   We each ordered a drink and being that we waited so long, we stated we were ready to order dinner as well.  The server explained she needed to do the drink order first and she would return.  Another 20 minutes later, she returned with our drinks.  Another 10 minutes later, she took our order.  Another 30 minutes later, we were having dinner.  Oh, haven't mentioned a drink reorder.  We didn't have one.  We asked for our checks and yep, True to form another 20 minutes later we got our checks and those of who paid cash got clean get aways but those with credit cards had another 20 minutes to wait.  The food was just ok and certainly not worth the high prices on the menu.  Sorry to say, we won't be back.  We will stick to Salt, Kabuki and Yard House at Westgate.",

We sat for 10 minutes or so and finally I got someone's attention to get us drinks and clean the table. It wasn't her table but she was very nice to help out. She said Austin would be taking our order. Another 10 minutes and no Austin. He walked by at least 5 times, making no eye contact at all. Another waitress came by and said he'd go get him. Still no Austin. Finally had to leave as we had limited to time by that time. Our beer was never delivered in all that time either.",

Do not come here before an event or you will sweat off all of your makeup!

This place is open later and it's nice and super clean. They have a great bar for drinks. Lots of choices to choose from. Come on Tuesdays because they have 5 dollars burgers every Tuesday!!! Best deal ever!! But the reason for the three stars is because of the service. The service was so bad. They weren't  all that busy but the waiter and waitresses are more interested in talking to eachother or being on the phone rather than helping us. After we got our entrees , we realized that there was no silverware, so we had to go over to the table next to us for some because our waiter was no where to be found. Every time we needed something we had to wait extra long for the waiter to come by to help us. I love the food but just wish the service here can be improved.",

I've been there before, and I've always been pretty happy with how they sincerely show Monumental effort to make sure everything is dialed in as much as possible, today was no exception. I ordered the blue Louie which was a delicious burger with blue cheese and bacon and it was messy as to be expected as well as super delish, medium-rare! I paired that was some crazy good tater tots and Fries which again was no issue for them so big plus there, and I topped it off with a double tequila skinny margarita. My wife had a bourbon Burger which she enjoyed as well and had a super delicious mojito. The bartender is always on point when it comes to drinks, you'll be able to recognize him because he is a young man that is highly charismatic, you will not be able to miss him trust me. Great guy, totally made sure that we were taken care of on the drink side and the waitress was amazing! She did not drop a single ball, and we were so grateful to have such a fun experience! Kudos to all the great people that make it happen and make Bar Louie such a fun place to be! Don't miss it kiddos!",

On top of that when we ordered our drinks we waited for about 90 mins and we only got 4 drinks that came out. They never took our order so we asked for a different waitress. The manager (Taylor Dennie, not sure if that's his real name) then comes out and ask if everything was okay? We answered honestly and said the service was bad. Then he proceeded to tell us that we didn't deserve his service cause we disrespected his server because we wanted a different one. The manager continue to escalate the situation and told us he doesn't understand how our drinks never came out because his bar wasn't backed up and then finally told us that we needed to leave.

Having been in this industry for many years in the past I tend to be very critical of places. If there was the option I would have given them 4.5 stars. There is always room for improvement. I feel they should have more bartenders it is bad when you have to wait 10-15 Minutes to get a draft beer. When you are making hand crafted drinks it takes a lot of time to make them right, which they do by the way. Thus it slows down the entire process. The drinks them selves are in my opinion highly over pticed, when you have 3 people that have three drinks each and the drinks total 90 that is Rediculous. But other than that I would recommend it to anybody and have already.",

We were lucky enough to find \"Melissa\" who was a server and she was nothing short of AMAZING!!  She really went out of her way to serve us despite the masses that were present.  She actually went out of her way to find seats for us on the patio, (people were grabbing seats from tables where ever they could find them), which really isn't right, but what can you do about that?  She was able to bring us appetizers and drinks despite being pulled in all directions by people I'm sure.  She even was able to find me a chair that some clown pulled for himself to another table.  BRAVO Melissa!!!!  Thank you so much for going out of your way!!!  You rock girl!!!!",

I spoke to the manager on duty (Jonathan), and he said as far as he has been working there, that's the rule. There was a few customers there that night. All the server's clearly saw that I walked in with a child, yet no one came up to inform us their \"after 10 PM rule\". No signs in front at all. I will never dine in at Bar Louie again. Poor customer service. Not to mention, the server always asked what temperature I want for the burgers and they NEVER come out the correct tempt.",

He was very kindly to explain briefly about the menu and recommend some of his favorite dishes from the menu. My friend got a Mac&Cheese grilled sandwich with pulled pork and she said it was very good! My other friend got their Voodoo pasta and she said it was the best pasta she hide. It was spicy so be prepared. I got myself a Voodoo chicken sandwich and woooooo their chicken was so savory and melts right in your mouth. I love this place! Although it was a pricy bill but I wouldn't mind coming back to splurge some good beers and food. Can't wait to be back already!",

However, thanks to happy hour appetizer specials (and most of us ordering burgers), our tab was extremely reasonable! There seemed to be confusion among the staff as to who was taking care of our table which became awkward when the two candidates didn't seem to get along. The calamari was rubbery, drink refills sometimes slow, and a few special order instructions missed.   All in all: Great values can be found, but keep your expectations low. I left feeling embarrassed we didn't take our out-of-town guests somewhere with better food and service when there are so many great restaurants in Phoenix.",

Came in at 6:40- intending on ordering some drinks from the half off happy hour martini menu- our waitress (Bailey) didn't bother coming to our table until 7:01 and let us know happy hour ended at 7. No worries- we then ordered regular drinks and she looked pissed that we didn't order alcohol- came back to our table asked if we were ready to order- we put in our order and haven't seen her again. It is now 7:48- our food was delivered and we are done eating- our drinks have been gone for 30 minutes and still no waitress. And no- it is not packed here in the least. The only reason this isn't a one star is because kudos to the chef- the chicken nachos and chicken tacos were good- wish we could have finished either of them since we had no drink- no water- no help- no service! We have been to the Bar Louie in Tempe several times and love it- this one is 5 minutes from our house and we will never return. How sad- we tip 25% every time (sometimes more) and order drinks normally with our meals and sometimes dessert or after dinner drinks. Tonight we are walking out of here completely disappointed and paying only... well it's now 7:57 and still no bill... $34.67. That's it. Done-",

The waiter took our appetizer order and forgot to put in one of our requests. We received one entree prior to the appetizers almost an hour after ordering. Our waiter only showed up 2 times during the entire visit here. The remaining entrees came out over two hours later. We asked for a manager- The manager came out to tell us the kitchen was impacted due to having 4 events going on that evening. The restaurant was not even 75% full at the time of the talk with the manager. Obviously the restaurant was not properly staffed nor managed at the time of our meal.

The menu has a great variety and portions are large.    We ordered the pot stickers for an app.   Cooked well with a bit of spice in the drizzle on the plate.       Next up was tortilla soup and house salad for me and Drunken Fish for my friend.    The tortilla soup was a 'cup' but was actually a huge bowl.  The ingredients are very fresh and the soup has a smokey taste to it.   The house salad was huge as well.   The Drunken Fish had a fantastic crispy beer batter very worthy of being the best we'd ever tasted.  The drinks from the bar are a bit heavy handed.  Of course that's nothing to complain about at all!       We went on a Saturday night and forgot about the late night club crowds at Westgate.  We sat outside and it was a bit noisy with the various clubs playing loudly but that was just part of the atmosphere and people watching.  We will be back again and again.",

    "text": "This was our first visit after a hockey game. We were excited to try something new. First order of business was picking out a drink. They are a martini bar and had lots of choices but I decided to go with a good ol dirty. It was perfect-served with blue cheese stuffed olives that were really good. I was impressed.  We both ordered burgers and tots. Although they were using the event menu there was still a good selection. I ordered the Burger Louie with bacon & blue cheese. I opted to leave off the fresh spinach and wish I would have asked for the buffalo sauce on the side. It was a little more tart than I like but my burger was still delicious. I really enjoyed the tots.  The service was really good especially since the place filled up with hockey fans. Honestly this is the first time we have eaten in Westgate that we both agree we would go to Westgate just to have dinner here. Needless to say we are fans.",

We got the szechuan boneless wings and a chicken quesadilla, both were very good and game us plenty to split. the prices were very reasonable and the martinis were strong and flavorful.  I look forward to going back to try more of their menu but would recommend this restaurant based off of my first experience.",

We shared chicken a flat bread which was great testing but very hot as it had chopped jalapenos on it. After complaining our server took it back and advised us to order with chimichuri on side. We also had lettuce wraps with spicy shrimp. I expected the shrimp to be sauteed but they were cooked in a sauce with some noodles that i did not care for but did not complain   Next time we again ordered the flat bread with  chimichuri sauce on side but it still was very hot and had very little chicken on it",

We ordered the nachos and they were not worth it. The cheese was burnt which made the chips stick to the tray. The nachos were served on a pizza platter and was decorated with chicken chunks and smashed black beans. Very little chicken and not a lot of flavor. It came with a queso dip which tasted a little gritty. The restaurant set up reminded us of the Yardhouse, but the Yardhouse has better food.",

I have been to Bar Louie several times in the last few weeks and I am happy to see the service has improved greatly since my last visit during the summer. It is quickly becoming my go to place to dine at Westgate.  The last few times I was there it was incredibly busy. Our server Kellie did an outstanding job keeping up despite having several large tables to manage. She was always popping up at the table like a dedicated stalker haha. I say that in a good way. She can hold her own in a conversation as well.   I am a sucker for the loaded tots I almost always open with those. My alternative is the Nachos Libra. For an entree you can't go wrong with baked mac and cheese.  Tater tots and Mac and cheese. That is comfort food.   I am on a sobriety kick right now so was happy to see several mock tail options. I always feel ackward drinking water when my company is enjoying alcohol. A mock tail is appreciated!   One final plus this place serves a full menu to close!",

    "text": "They have some really good happy hour prices & the flat breads are tasty. We've been to this location a handful of times for just drinks at the bar & had really good service. We've also tried to eat at the bar in the past & had horrible service. As in placing a food order, watching people who ordered after us receiving food & the order never showing up in their system. Apparently the bar tender had just left mid shift. This was on a busy Friday at dinner time. The manager on duty came over & apologized & gave us a couple of drink/app comps. So we thought hey one more try on food & we sat at a table on another Friday evening. The server was stretched pretty darn thin as in she was handling the West side patio & inside West side tables. I'd say she had 10+ tables (without a busser). She barely had time to greet let alone do her own refills etc. So that's not her fault at all. She did come by as often as she could but it wasn't enough. The food wasn't good either. We ordered the lettuce wraps which were too wet & sweet. No where did the description read sweet & sour chicken wraps.The lettuce was hot on the edges where it clearly had sat too long under a heat lamp, The burger was really tasty but the fries were bland. So if you want a fun place to hang for happy hour go for it. Sit at the bar & don't order anything other than the flatbread. This location needs to have more dependable staff. This is clearly a training & staffing issue on top of poorly executed dishes. Sadly won't be back for more than a good priced beer & moving on. We really like the location & the atmosphere is on point for fun. Just poorly executed on every level. Sad, sad face.",

The seating is open which would normally be a great thing to me but on a busy night maybe they should've had a host(ess).  My group and I found an open seat eventually that hadn't gotten cleaned yet. No problem! Except the dirty plates on the table must've made the staff think we had finished eating because no one came for literally twenty minutes. Finally, someone in my party flagged a waitress down who wasn't even supposed to be ours. Even after we ordered it took a HALF HOUR to get chips, salsa, and guac. Seriously? A little long..   I'm giving three stars because when our server was around, she was extremely friendly. She apologized numerous times for how everything was going and it really wasn't her fault as she wasn't even our assigned server. However, waiting in 20-30 minute intervals for food/drinks was extremely obnoxious. Towards the end of our stay, it wasn't even packed in the restaurant.   The drinks, however, are amazing! Whoever is tending the bar, while they are slow, they are great at what they do. Grab a couple mixed drinks from the bar while you're here!   All in all - they need to just work on service and staff accordingly for busy nights. I wouldn't come here on the weekend.",

Wanted BBQ sauce for the dry brisket sliders, she forgot & they were cold by the time we asked again. Need to find another place because they can't handle a relatively slow happy hour. It was like there were so many servers & they were stepping over each other. Then at the end the bill was wrong even after she came to check to see who had what. Very poor experience . Too bad because the burgers are usually good on Tuesday.",

The wife ordered Mac n cheese with chicken. The mac n cheese tasted burnt. The waitress forgot to take it off the bill. We had to remind her. Unfortunately, the waitress seemed nice and overwhelmed but very doubtful we will be back. So disappointed!  If there was an option for zero stars would have given that.",

Bar Louie is an awesome addition to the Westgate community. Her co-workers and bosses succeeded in creating a positive working environment. Big kudos to Pat and Rachel for their managerial and people skills, they always make me feel welcome and at home. I enjoy every visit and so do my friends.    Oh and the food and drinks are fantastic!",

But the service and food was horrible. 4 of us ordered different things and was totally surprised when None of us didn't enjoy it. Service was really slow. This is just my opinion. So enter at your own risk. Overall bad experience and will never go back.",

    "text": "Bar service was decent! It went downhill when we decided to move to a table. The bartender told us just to grab a table once one became available and he would send a server. The place wasn't too busy but we were a big group so we waited for a big enough table. So one out in the patio area opened up and we took it. In that particular section, there was only one other group of people which were getting ready to leave. The server didn't acknowledge our presence, even with her going back and forth to that group many times. So after what seemed like 30 minutes of waiting we asked her if she could please get us a server, and we were polite as we didn't want bad vibes flowing around. She thought about it for a while and said she was going to look for our server. Another 15 or so minutes went by and nothing. We called her back again and it seem like she didn't like that we called on her again. She responded again with I will go look for your server but then she said I guess I can take your order. WOW but anyways we placed our orders. Another table opened up inside and we decided to move since it was a bit on the cool side and we didn't want our food to get cold to fast. Well we might as well stayed outside, some of our food seemed as if it had been sitting for a while. The cheese was a bit on the tuff side, fries were cold, one of our plates (veggie wrap) wasn't even brought out. So when we told the server not to make the wrap anymore she said she would send her manager. It took a while for the manager to come to our table. When he finally did, we explained our issues, he did apologize and said that they ran out of veggies for the veggie wrap we never received and said they would give us a 20% discount on our bill. That's fine but why weren't we told immediately after they found out about their veggie issue, we would of placed another order for something else?!?!?! Then the server went to get us our bill, she was a ways away but near enough for us to observe her. Another server approached her and she looked towards our way and back to the other server, what ever they said to each other didn't seem nice. But again what ever, they will not be getting our business again. I do wish them (Bar Louie) well and much success.",

The thought that it can maintain its beauty will be the test of time. I know Bar Louie from the Chi-town and the last attempt was a bust and that old sight is the location for Calico Jacks. A recommend folks come and check it out!!!!",

We see people just walk up and sit at the patio so we go in to ask about our table. We walk up and are informed that it's open seating. So they forgot about the guest list they made us sign. They seat us at a table that had not been cleaned yet. Literally still had dishes and glasses on it. 10 mins for our waitress to come greet us. 20 more mins to get a salad appetizer. Another 25 mins to get our food. Almost 2 hours to get average bar food. Was not impressed at the food nor the customer service. On top of it all, this was my birthday dinner.",

The bartender introduced herself and the other bartender by name.  We were provided great service and recommendations on drinks.  I asked to speak to the manager to share my thoughts. She was very humble and gave all the credit to her staff.  I'm definitely coming back and recommend Bar Louie for future company outings.",

    "text": "First and foremost, I have been to Bar Louie quite a few times...just not this location, and have had great experiences. We had planned our vacation in AZ for New Year's Eve and decided that we would get a table at Bar Louie at this location since it was close to the house we rented and near where festivities would be happening. Looking back now, I would have NEVER decided this was the place to spend our money.   The night started fine as we had paid for a table to be reserved so we got to skip the big line and go straight to the table. Got to the table, seemed fine at first, waitress Taylor was excellent. She is one reason this place gets one star. A few minutes later the \"entertainment\" started. The reason it is in quotes is because it is nowhere near what I would consider pleasant entertainment. We were seated SO close to the music and it was so loud that I couldn't hear my husband speak and he was sitting right next to me. I almost lost my voice within the first hour of being there due to trying to yell to our friends seated across the table from us. After putting up with it for over an hour, we decided this is NOT what we expected after spending hundreds of dollars so we asked to be moved. This started a chain of events that will prevent me from EVER spending money at any Bar Louie ever again.   We were first told that there was a table outside that we could have...turns out it was a 5 top for 7 people to squeeze around and was actually right next to the speaker. When we said that would not work, especially for the amount of money we paid, we asked to speak to a manager. Come to find out management was one of the biggest let downs of all. Taylor, one of the managers, was supposed to speak with my husband and he tried his hardest to absolutely avoid him completely. It was so loud in there my husband wanted to speak outside to have an adult conversation with a manager and it turns out that it was too much to ask. Once my husband tracked him down, we were informed that we had to put up with our table because \"we picked it\". Again you can notice the quotes....when we reserved a table we were NOT given the option to pick a table...in which apparently everyone else who spent the same money we did got to choose their table. First slap in the face. He then continued to tell us there was nothing he would do and offer absolutely NO discount to our tab. Second slap in the face. After my husband voiced his utter disbelief that a company would insult paying customers and treat them so terribly, we were \"granted\" an $80 discount. Peanuts compared to the amount of money we were spending.   The only other person that earned this place that one star is the hostess Maddie. She was the only saving grace this night as she tried her hardest to help us out. She found 3 tiny round bar tables and placed them outside for us. Found us two chairs, and got us away from the head throbbing music to toast to the New Year. She went above and beyond that night for us and is the only positive thing besides our waitress that any of us can mention from that night.   Now we are on to the third and final slap to the face. My husband checked his credit card statement and realized later that they not only charged us for the food and drinks we consumed that night but also $400 to reserve the table. When making the reservation Patrick, also a manager, explained they were taking his credit card to hold the table and that nothing would be charged; a bold faced lie. He also explained that $200 would be charged to the table that night with a $200 credit towards food and drinks and then we would pay the difference. We ended up splitting the additional $200 between us and left a great tip since our waitress was amazing, unlike the treatment we had received from management. To top it off the manager who had tried so hard to avoid my husband, Taylor, brought the check to the table and explained that he took off $80 and the rest is the \"TOTAL\" amount we owed. Once we got home, my husband found out they have NOT removed the $400 they charged his card, plus kept all the money we had spent on top of that. After multiple conversations with Patrick, they refused to do anything about the additional charge.   So to round the whole experience out, this was one of the WORST places I have ever spent any of my money at and will refuse to ever do it again, no matter the location. I rarely ever write reviews to places, but I felt an obligation to let people know that this establishment has the worst customer service and management staff I have ever dealt with. I will continue to tell everyone I know (and don't know for that matter) to NEVER come here EVER.",
