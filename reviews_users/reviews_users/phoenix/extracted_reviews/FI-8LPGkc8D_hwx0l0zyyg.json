Started with a very long wait on busy Saturday night in Scottsdale. Expected but hostess failed to explain we would be notified by cell phone text when we checked in. Gave her my bros cell but we had no idea this was their paging system that was not explained to us. After almost an hour wait when told only 3o minutes brother finally checked with hostess as too why so long. Turned out we Never received text saying our table was ready. Couple comments about that: creative idea using text but problem is not everyone has a good cell phone. Second we weren't told this was the system to notify us. Third the music was way to loud! Even if text had arrived we would not have been able to hear the alert come through on a phone even turn up to high volume. Suggestion: if someone does not respond to cell phone text Page Them next!! That wasn't done though we heard other groups paged.  Turn down the music!!! This is a restaurant where people want to talk and enjoy the food. Not a bar or dance venue!! Subtle music makes for better ambiance people!!   Okay bad first impression aside the rest of the evening went well. Our server was super attentive and she was working other tables and one right next to ours with a very large group. By the way we sat outside in the patio which helped to decrease having to shout at each other over the overpowering music. the food was amazing! Even the salsa which can be The food was amazing! Even the salsa which can be very bland at Mexican restaurants was flavorful and not too spicy.  Kudos to the chefs!!! We order the seasonal Coconut, Pineapple margarita's. They were very good. Not sure why a Margarita would be seasonal since that is usually a staple at Mexican restaurants. It's winter too so tropical ingredients and seasonal again didn't make sense but whatever they were good and we each had 2. Our nacho appetizer was a HUGE portion! Brother ordered House Specialty Enchiladas and said they were best he had ever eaten. I ordered chipotle shrimp soft tacos with black beans and rice. Everything was delicious and ample portions. Doggie bags were a necessity!   I must comment about the hostess that came to our table to check with us about our experience. Sorry pretty girl with long black hair I forgot your name,one too many margaritas. She was amazing! We let  her know right away about the unhappy start to our evening and she went above and beyond to make it right and even gave us my brothers birthday dessert, a Mexican chocolate cake with ice cream top which I had already ordered, on the house!!  By the way you must try this cake!! It's pure heaven for the taste buds!! What could have been a really negative experience, good food or not, was turned completely around simply by going that extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. Nice touch management keep that up!! We will be back.",

    "text": "Having that urban chic warehouse idea that doesn't give hint with cliche regional Mexico decor towards the modern Mexican food to be found is quite nice. Large white washed beams, iron round cage industrial lighting and wood slat raised wall details reminiscent of the 70's offers the modern Scottsdale atmosphere you hope to find in the area.   Okay, enough of the eye candy. We're hip and happy with atmosphere (although current dance music pumped at overwhelming levels making any form of normal conversation very difficult needs to be dealt with, it was so loud it's one reason for the loss of a star) but what of the food.   Like any Mexican restaurant worth its salt chips and salsa come quickly to the table. Hand made, thick and crunchy and a nice thick pureed salsa with small heat are standard but good.   Our group ordered a variety of tacos and chicken enchiladas. I chose three barbecue pulled pork on flour tortillas. Done in a street taco open face style when they arrive to your table. The pork was tender, well seasoned and included slices of pickled red onion (apparently all the rage right now? It provided a nice tart pop to the more mellow but full pork flavors. A tad on the dry side, but the beans were saucy enough I was able to spoon a little to each taco. The enchilada was layered like lasagna and quite tasty and felt unique. The rice was a bit off for some in the party as it seemed like it had been mixed with butter perhaps. I didn't mind and found it rather tasty.  Other taco places I have sampled and go to regularly offer True a la carte portions and more unique flavor combinations (\"Moms Ortega taco, barbecue pork with fried pickles, Philly cheesesteak tacos, even mashed potato\"), this is a good sampling and does offer numerous options if you want  to try Mexican food in a more modern but easily recognized style.",

Pomegranate and grapefruit was my favorite combo. They even have weekly specialty cocktails.You can order three different types of tacos instead of just 3 of the same kind, which is great because I wanted to try more than one kind (I had chipotle grilled shrimp, carne asada and grilled fish).  My favorite was the carne asada, but the grilled shrimp was a close second.  Comes with black or pinto beans and a lovely, buttery white rice with corn (this was a truly unique rice and I would definitely come back just to try it again). Happy hour from 4pm includes half off drinks. Don Julio drinks for $5? Anytime!",

The effect is such that you feel like you're in a happening place, but you can also have a conversation with your tablemates.   We kept is simple; chips with guacamole--perfect--and we each had a taco selection. This is fun, because you get to choose the tacos that you want. We ended up with six different kinds: carnitas, shrimp, bbq chicken, beef, veg. All were delicious. They are small--so if you're really hungry, you might be a little disappointed on the size.

Our light lunch very quickly turned into an all afternoon affair peppered with cocktails, tacos and dessert galore.  We started with the guacamole, which was very fresh and flavorful.  For entrees, the three of us each ordered a different taco plate, and we all shared, which was the way to go.  We had the Carnitas, Carne Asada and Shrimp.  Although the Carnitas was great, the Shrimp tacos took the grand prize.  They are battered in a Negro Modelo batter and fried.  The sauce pairs perfectly, and the salsa is perfect.  For dessert, we tried one of everything.  I was a huge fan of the flan, which was extremely light and perfect consistency.  The chocolate cake was insanely rich.  The bread pudding was awesome.  All that, and I haven't even got to the best part- the tequila!  I enjoyed delicious Paloma's throughout the meal, and my guest had margaritas.  We were all quite pleased.  We also enjoyed a nice Don Julio 1942 to top everything off.  The cocktail list is diverse and full of fresh ingredients.  The tequila list is extensive and well-rounded.  I highly recommend their patio if you have an afternoon (and a healthy budget) to waste.",

I tend to come here more for happy hour deals then dinner entries but that doesn't mean the food is bad. THE GUAC IS A MUST! I get it every time and I swear it's so good and I tend to just eat that,salsa, and margs, which is why I tend to not have room for any entrees! The staff has always been nice and have no issue getting you chip and salsa refills 2-3 times lol",

    "text": "We met up with some friends here on a recent weekend trip to Phoenix and had a really fun evening. I would say I am a fan more so because of the ambience and service. We snagged a patio table for our party of 7 and it was a perfect evening for dining al fresco. The whole restaurant itself has a nice vibe to it and is as trendy as you expect the Fox Restaurant group to be. Our server was really friendly and sooooo patient with us. He offered lots of suggestions when we couldn't decide on drinks or menu items. I tried their pork enchiladas and thought they were just OK. They were a bit spicy for my taste so I actually didn't finish my plate which is unusual...but it may have just been me not feeling the spicy that evening, who knows. My husband, however, learned from our server to order the fajitas IN a burrito and he loved it. He polished off his plate completely clean. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food as no one was complaining. I would be willing to come back and try some other items from their menu. I think I should have looked at the menu a little more and picked something that I was really excited about. Next time!",

We shared some guac... and it was fine... not overly flavorful, but not bad or inedible... I had the short rib enchiladas and they were also ok. The short rib was good, but the sauce did not add anything to it. The beans were bland and the rice was waaay too buttery. The BF had the chicken tacos, which he liked, but I thought it was at about the same level as chilis.... nothing special. We had the tres leches cake and it was really dry for supposedly being a tres leches cake.... It kinda tasted like a dry carrot cake with milk around it. Not awesome. I would not come back here, but the food isn't really worth the money in my opinion.",

Despite the restaurant touting its vegetarian / gluten free options (even here on yelp), rudimentary items, such as the \"cheese crisp with guacamole\" are, in fact, lard-based. I understand lard is used in authentic Mexican cuisine, which this is not.  Here's a \"concept\" for you, Fox - label your menus in accordance with 21st century standards. As a result of this visit and your irresponsible practices, I'm removing all Fox restaurants from my dining and entertainment repertoires - too many other superior (and responsible) options in town.",

    "text": "I've been to Blanco's a ton of times, but I keep forgetting to write down my review, so here it goes:  Fox Concept restaurants are, by far, my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I'm a huge fan of Olive & Ivy (check out my review), and Blanco's Tacos & Tequila. We come here for lunch about once a month in a group of 6 or so. It's pretty conveniently located too for anyone in the Old Town area.   Since I'm a regular here, i can speak on consistency. Their service is always great. I've read multiple reviews complaining about the service and I've never experienced it, and I've been here for lunch and dinner. The food is also always good, never disappoints.  Food: I always get tacos. I've tried 4 different types: fish, chicken, carnitas, and carne asada. My fave is always the carne asada, but the rest are great. The beans are boring, but that's pretty much anywhere you go. Let's talk about that rice: What the heck do they put in that rice?! Cheese? cream? I don't know, but it's an ongoing mystery with my fellow Blanco's guests. I can't describe how delish it really is, you just have to try it yourself.   The only thing my husband doesn't like is the serving size. Personally, I think it's perfect, but he's a big man, so he needs a lot of food. Just watch out for appetizers, that's where my bill tends to add up quickly.   Kids meals are good and not much different than most other mexican establishments.",

No room for dessert but we were feeling fat and happy.  Will definitely return!",

Yes I time these things.  Ordered the $24 Margarita for my wife whole loves them, brought it out without salt.  Waiter said \"Oh you want salt?\"  For $23 dollars you need not ask?  My sons Fajitas came out 7 minutes before the rest of our meals.  Waiter said that they get them out first because of the sizzle.  I put my finger on the iron cast and it was warm when it should have burned me.  Remainder of dinner did not get any better.  Luke warm dinners.  Service was vey inattentive and had to chase waiter down for check.  Do NOT recommend this establishment.  Taco Bell would be a better option.",

There was an immediate cool factor from the moment we walked in... now initially, it might of been from the AC that saved us from the scorching AZ sunshine but as we got seated next to the bar, this place had a great lively, hip atmosphere.  Loved the bar in the middle of the main floor.  As for the food, I had a customized short rib burrito bowl.  The house salsa and short rib were perfect.  Both were full of flavor and the salsa wasn't generic or watered down pico de gallo that some restaurants serve.  The food we got was made with thought and high quality ingredients.  I'm also an elote/corn fan so we had to try to street corn, which had good flavor but would probably pass next time.  Service was excellent and portions were just right especially since we were traveling.  Would definitely recommend if you're looking for good, quality food in a fun space.",

Once we were seated, we were served immediately with a bowl of chips and salsa and water to drink while deciding on our drink order. I really liked the salsa. It wasn't as spicy as I would like but I did like the savory garlicky flavorful taste of the salsa.   I got the Jalapeno margarita and hubs got patron on the rocks. Drink prices were not too bad and the pour was nice.  We got a mix match of the tacos and were able to sample six different types. I was definitely a fan of the green chili pork and the slow cooked bbq pork. Wasn't a big fan of the fish tacos and the short rib. Having said that, everything overall was good and service was great. Our drinks were filled at all times and the servers were helpful and friendly.   Hubs and I will be back, we loved the vibe of the place.",

However, the recent menu changes have made it a very average Mexican restaurant that we won't go to as often. The most disappointing change is that the enchiladas are no longer served in skillets. They're just two regular enchiladas on the plate - nothing special, and not nearly as good. The beans are also served on the plate, without cheese and pico, and not as good. And the new salsa recipe is below average. These all seem like cost savings and efficiency changes, and we understand this is a business and those changes can be necessary. But it's really just an ordinary Mexican restaurant now, which are a dime a dozen in Phoenix. Very disappointing.",

They were good! Go for au natural with the agave syrup.  So much better than mix.  Much better flavor.  Sort of like a skinny but without the soda water.  YUM.  Once we finally were seated, the service was very pleasant and somewhat quick. the kids both had a kids taco plate.  I had the Mexican chopped  with steak.  The steak was awesome, very good.

The patio was a great place to wait for our table and we enjoyed some drinks. The margarita was a little weak but otherwise tasty.  We had the corn appetizer which was quite nice (but small - order 1 for every 2-3 people). Guacamole was okay - flavorful but had numerous large chunks of avocado in it, which is a no-no for me and makes dipping challenging. We also tried a cheese crisp that was basically an open-face quesadilla and was okay. Chips and salsa were solid.  I tried the mushroom tacos and fish tacos. Both were good but nothing special. Fish could use a bit of a tastier marinade perhaps. Overall, everything was quite fresh and everyone enjoyed their meal. This isn't the most authentic Mexican food, but it's well-presented using quality ingredients, so it's a solid choice over most places. I'd definitely recommend it for groups as well.",

Okay, I wanted to add a note after reviewing some of the other recent ones and while we all have different taste, therefore different expectations I want to remind everyone that if there is something wrong or we don't like let Management know and give them a chance to correct. Even if the server fixes what's wrong, speak with management let them know of the problem and how it was managed even the successes help make it better.

Went there for happy hour tonight, the prices are a little steep for HH but it was what I expected to pay at a Scottsdale restaurant.   First off, we were greeted and sat instantly. Our server Drew was bright and friendly. Went over the HH menu and the regular one. Waters with chips and salsa were brought out within minutes, followed by beers. Our food was delivered hot and before we finished our first drink! He continued to check on us and made sure we were taken care of.   We both tried all 3 tacos on the happy hour menu, not a fan of the chicken one but 2 out of 3 isn't bad.  We also had to try the yummy rich chocolate cake and we were not disappointed. I was a huge fan of the salsa too!   Great patio and environment, we will definitely be back!",

She transferred us to another guy who took our order, he was also extremely polite and professional. And said that our order would take about 20 min.  In 20 min, we walked up to the bar and were greeted and helped out. I ordered the slow cooked BBQ tacos and the portobello and vegetable cheese crisp. They were both extraordinarily delicious. Even as a take out, the cheese crisp was crispy. It's like of like a pizza or flatbread, but way crispier. My meal also came with black beans and rice, as well as chips and fresh salsa. Very pleased with this place.",

On the weekends they usually have a DJ playing an eclectic genre of music. The service is fast and the margaritas are on point! This place host new style Mexican food and over all clean ingredients used in the food. Even times when they are busy you can arrive with no reservation and be seated in a reasonable amount of time. This is a environment you cam bring kids for dinner, but can become noisy and with a lot going on. Try this place out you will not regret it. My favorite dish is the fajitas! if you are looking for less food look at the taco selection. This is one of my favorite Fox Concepts.",

The tuna ceviche may have been the worst I have ever eaten.  The only thing you could taste in the fish tacos was the corn tortilla. No spices, no cilantro, no spice, no flavor. The music was just loud enough where you could not really have a decent conversation if you were sitting inside. Overall, drinks on the patio would be the only reason I would go back.",

(They should really bag that stuff up and sell it- THAT good.) Our server was cheerful and offered us some margaritas and explained the menu a bit... turns out they had just revamped it a few days before. We were excited to be guinea pigs and I ordered the 'new' camarones tacos and my boyfriend ordered the pork enchiladas along with a couple of classic margaritas.   To begin with... the margaritas were awesome. And then comes the food... delicious! The three street tacos were plenty and the rice that comes with is awesome. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his enchiladas and liked the fact that they were made in layers to ensure a little bit of everything in each bite.   Although we were stuffed our server tempted us to try the flan... and I'm glad they did... it was yummmy! Overall a fantastic experience. Without hesitation, we will be back!",

Entrees were good but not amazing or particularly special. But shout out to our awesome waiter Fletcher. You were incredible. Very attentive, down to earth and nice.

We met our friends last Saturday for dinner, I asked the hostess if they had a gluten free menu and she stated that most items on the menu are gluten free and be sure to tell our server and request the gluten free chips.  After being seated, I requested from our server GF chips and was told that were out that day, I thought he was joking but he was not, feeling disappointed we placed our order and when our food arrived my husband had requested flour tortillas with his street tacos and received corn, when my husband told the server he said they could send them back but as the rest of us had our food and he didn't want to wait for them to be redone the server stated that he would provide a complimentary desert. While eating our meal about half way through my cheese enchiladas I realized that I had been glutened, as I have celiac and it is always risky eating out.  We received our check and waited for the server to return with the desert and that didn't happen.  Since I was not feeling well, we decided to leave, not a good first impression.   This is a popular place and very loud.  Be cautious if looking for gluten free options.",

I have to admit that their margaritas are amazing but I have been three times now and have always been disappointed in their salads and entrees.  I may be a little picky and love good Mexican food but I find that my food tends to be bland and definitely leaves something to be desired.

The quesadillas and crab and shrimp ceviche were really good apps to start of with. You can mix and match three of the tacos when you order. I had the carne asada, machaca, and chipotle shrimp. Of the three the machaca was the best. The place is a fun hip mexican spot.",

The waitress (Mariah) took a little while to get to us, initially we didn't mind. We got water and chips and salsa and waited for about 15 minutes on our drinks. We ordered our food, which came out at a reasonable time. By this time we never saw our waitress again, she was just roaming around. We had to go up to the bar (bartender was so nice) to ask for limes, hot sauce, salsa, and more water. The food is just okay here. I ordered the Mahi, avocado, and crispy shrimp tacos on corn. They didn't even cook the tortilla. I couldn't reorder because we never saw our waitress. The mahi and avocado had no flavor and the crispy shrimp was okay. We will not be back. Food was no good. Service was TERRIBLE.",

The filling was that good short rib and it was served with charro beans and good rice with corn. Unusual style, but great meal...$14 Fajitas - long strips of marinated white meat chicken with at least six corn tortillas. Onions and peppers were also present, along with some guac and sour cream. The chicken was the star as the meat was just so flavorful - $17.  Otherwise, the chips were free and crunchy served with a thinner type red salsa and great service, but they do close at 9pm on weekdays, so during tourist season, it is best to arrive after 7:30pm for a short wait for a table.",

They have a good selection of lux tequilas, but surprisingly not as much of a selection for mid-tier or budget tequilas that you can find at other places. Prices are what you'd expect from this part of town.   I've been a few times, and this place can get PACKED. I know that's a good thing for Fox Concepts, but waiting forever for even a seat at the bar can be a real bummer.   The staff is mostly friendly. Big ups for the bartenders, who were both knowledgeable and entertaining.   Food is delicious with quality ingredients. No complaints there.   Overall, Blanco is a good  place for grub and drinks. Just make sure to call ahead and check on capacity in case you have a time limit.",

I have a friend who is away for school and often says she misses Sam Fox more than her parents; I can understand why. :)   My parents and I were very excited to return to one of favorite restaurants. We started our meal with complimentary chips and salsa. We ordered their famous guacamole to share and it was wonderful.   Next, we ordered our entrees. My mom got the Mexican salad, I got a vegetable fajita platter, and my dad got chicken tacos. Everything was delicious and the kitchen was very accommodating with our modifications. It is a super vegan friendly, but the way.  We can't wait for our next meal at Blanco!",

Blanco's staff did a pretty good job with the service. We ordered a number of sides of queso (because cheese), and there was a hair in one of them. So that's not great.   The second time I came in for lunch with a friend, and while the service left something to be desired, we did enjoy our grilled mahi fish tacos and the rice alongside it, which must be filled with butter because it was so good.   Overall, I'll probably be back because Blanco is a popular restaurant with my friends and the food is pretty good, but I probably wouldn't come here on my own because the service wasn't great, and that hair....",

Both were good. I had the tacos and every bite was delish, however they could have put a little more Yellow fin tuna in there. The wife's salad had a wonderfully seasoned and generous portion of Mahi. Delish! She also had the Blood Orange Italian margarita and said it was fab.

There were no spices, seasoning or anything. Just some cheap stuff out of a jar, I presume. Our shrimp tacos were seasoned terribly, no flavor whatsoever.

Love the fact that the outdoor patio had little heat lamps...ya know, for the frigid 50s that Phoenix hits on winter nights (sense of midwestern, we just got another frickin' foot of snow last night. sarcasm here!!).  Great patio lounging area, and the inside (where we chose to dine) is wide-open and airy.  I think I ate three whole avocados here the night I had dinner.  First, the guacamole, which was delish (and the chips were stellar enough for me to break my carb-free diet for a few!)  Then my ceviche (shrimp and crab), which was more of a slaw than a ceviche, but very good nonetheless...avocado in there.  Then my salad with goat cheese, pistachios, and yes, more avocado.  (Told ya, I ate three avocados!)  Service was friendly.  I dig the striped shirts they ahd going on there, however, as my ever-so-smart pal pointed out, \"They would never last in Chicago\" (ya know, the whole we hate striped shirts, and \"we're annoyed by former frat boys named Chad\" deal we have going on here.)  Not bad...perhaps I should've tried a margarita!  Oh, and basked in the glow of the heat lamp in a comfy chair on the patio.  Perhaps another day.",

I obviously wasn't the first to notice the \"uniforms\" and asked where was Sheriff Joe's pink underpants.  He almost responded with a show and tell but refrained from exposure.  While waiting the grey cracked large beam ceiling, blue colored upholstery and miles of small tile on the wall make for a contrasting visual experience.  I started with a draft XX larger  and started munching on thick and tasty chips.  Muy bueno with a large portion of mild salsa!!! I then ordered the ahi seared tuna with two soft tacos & black beans.  Muy bueno with small chunks of tuna and chopped veggies - just the right combination of flavors and color!!!  While eating it was hard not to notice the waiters with horizontal striped shirts and casual blue/grey jeans.  Most of them carried a holster for their order books plus an extra towel or two hanging just below almost to their knees.  The towels came in handy for clearing tables and seems like a good idea for other restaurants to  adopt - especially in AZ.  I will have to return at Happy Hour between 4 & 6 sometime soon to see how the inside meets the outside via glass garage doors plus half price margaritas.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in the mood for a little Mexican dining tonight, so we decided to give Blanco a try.   Blanco had everything going for it when we got there. We found a parking space right upon driving in, we were seated in a big semicircular booth that offered a great view for people watching, and we were intrigued by the menu.   We really enjoyed the atmosphere here. The modern, tres chic feel was counterbalanced by the whitewashed wood in the ceiling giving the place an ambiance that was part beach, part Scottsdale.   As others have said, the food is quite good. The slightly-sweet-yet-spicy salsa that arrives with a bowl of freshly fried tortilla chips was very good (and slightly reminiscent of what On The Border used to serve, just not that sweet). We opted for margaritas (she had the blood orange version while I stuck with a traditional blended marg) which we both agreed were flavorful without being overloaded with tequila.   In particular, we really liked the braised short rib. We got it on the cheesy tortilla item (think 12\" tortilla made into a Mexican pizza) and it was accompanied by avocado and some other veggies and was delicious.   We also ordered the carnitas tacos which they offered to split for us (giving each of us our own rice, beans, and one taco). The pork was tender and not fatty (a gripe I often have of Chipotle and the like) and the tacos were very good when accompanied by a little guacamole and sour cream.   So why only three stars? There were a few things dragging down Blanco for us. They include:   1. SLOOOOW Service - judging from other reviews, it doesn't sound as if this is always a problem, but everything moved slowly for us when we were there (drinks took over 10 minutes to arrive after ordering, food took almost 30 minutes). I know when the service could be better as I start getting Antsy waiting for stuff after a certain point and that happened when we were at Blanco.   2. Warm, not hot, food - The manager asked us how everything was and we commented that our pizza wasn't very hot when it arrived at our table. I'll give him credit for marching back over to the open kitchen and sharing his thoughts on the matter with the staff, but I would have expected hot food. My guess is that the slow service may have had something to do with this.   3. Overall food prep - there were just a few things that could be improved. For example, using two tortillas per soft tacos would keep them together a bit more. Leaving the Pico de Gallo on the side would keep people (like my wife) who don't eat it from having to scrape it off.   One note on the Guacamole - there are two sizes (an appetizer size for $9 and a side item size for $5). We opted for the smaller size and they brought it out with our chips. There was PLENTY for using before and with dinner for two people so consider this option if you want to save $4.   We'll give Blanco another try in the future - it has all the right elements to earn four stars from us...next time they just have to deliver on them.",

    "text": "This new Sam Fox restaurant opens on November 24 (OK, so they DO have one in Tucson, but it's new to us). We had the privilege of going to a Pre-Opening dinner to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Essentially, all of the money we paid to attend went to CFF and Blanco essentially gave us an open tab at their restaurant. It was a complete dry run, so the entire menu was in play!   First off, very friendly staff. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, but the bar was lively and, while crowded, it was still easy to stand around and enjoy your drink, with the house DJ also keeping the mood buzzing. If we had wanted to \"hover\" for a couch, their patio is filled with big blue couches and fire-pits, facing Scottsdale road. Their full menu is served on the patio (as well as the bar), but we decided that we'd wait for a booth inside.   Once seated, or server made sure we were all set on drinks and walked us through the menu. We started by sharing a Roasted Chicken and Poblano Chile Crisp, which is essentially a little Mexican pizza. For a main course, I enjoyed the Fish Tacos, while the Seared Ahi Tacos and the Beef Enchiladas also graced our table. Not exactly earth shattering dining concepts, but there wasn't a bite of food left when it was all over.   For desert, our server recommended that we try THREE different desserts, so we went with the Tres Leche (kind of an oat-ish interpretation, but good!), the Caramel Flan (excellent! and probably the largest hunk of flan I'd ever seen!) and finally, the Rich Chocolate Cake (very dense and a bit too chocolaty, even for me).   All in all, a good meal, but what rockets this rating to 4-stars instead of a possible 3 were the margaritas. All the juices are fresh and they aren't too tart OR too sweet. And, while you didn't necessarily realize it by taste, there was enough tequila in them to put down a small horse. By my second margarita, there was no way I was driving home. We'll be back to Blanco soon, but next time we're hiring a driver!",

For example, the fish tacos are grilled Mahi instead of deep fried or the usual white fish. The staff wears funny striped shirts. The decor is modern and pretty cool, their colors and branding remind me of Tammie Coe Cakes. They have a good selection of tequila. And the food is just ok. If you want great Mexican food, I suggest finding the closest hole in the wall. You will feed two for the price of one at Blanco. Not that Blanco was no bueno, but for the price, it should be great. It is worth a try, though, so go and see for your self.",

For starters, the name made me believe they were doing something different and cool...maybe serving a shot of tequila with each taco order?? but no...nothing. Second, the tacos...ehhh nothing to scream about. Maybe I'm biased having grown up in LA and eating at one of the most amazing Mexican restaurants in SF, but these just lacked some punch and flavor. Ease up on the cabbage too pls! I want to taste more than greens in my taco!  I went back for a second time so I can try a different combination of tacos. I've eaten the carne asada, chicken, fish, and ahi...only the ahi was decent. I do have to say the cheese crisps they have as appetizers are great. A crispy quesadilla always wins me over. Pretty decent guac, not the best I've ever had, but good. Rice has maybe a gallon of butter in it...yum! Ha!  Being a FOX restaurant, the design of the place was great. Loved the set up with the step down bar in the middle and tables around it. Open kitchen is cool. Good music. Bit of a wait sometimes, but good for people watching and once you sit down the service is just fine.  All in all, I probably won't be back for a dinner, but maybe an ice cold Pacifico or margarita on the rocks with a crisp appetizer at the bar.",

There's not much in the way of lively spots near the Borgata, but Blanco injects a little bit of attitude into this quiet shopping center. The patio space is expansive, and it's a real relaxing atmosphere. They bump some strange, spacey house music, which feels a bit out of place, but it's not loud enough to be annoying or ruin the mood. The ceviches are excellent: try the big eye tuna or the crab and shrimp. The housemade gazpacho base is very citrusy and juicy, which really gives the meat some kick.   The chips are thick and crispy, but lack the seasoning needed. The salsa was fresh and peppery. The pureed tomato doesn't overpower for a good blend.  All the Sam Fox restaurants are solid concepts, and this one is no different. It's fun, hip, California attitude in the Valley and it's welcomed. Most higher-end Mexican spots are pretty cavernous and bland with no atmosphere to speak of, but Blanco is top notch.",

I think I remember a quote from Mr. Fox that (and I'm paraphrasing) a dinner out isn't about the food, it's about the experience. By that standard Mr. Fox did well with Blanco.  I personally think the food is a big part of the experience, I could even argue it's the biggest part.  Not that the food was awful by any means but I wasn't really blown away by any of it.  Machaca tacos were okay, buttered rice was simple enough but hardly Mexican, ceviche was alright.  Are you noticing a trend here? Motto of the story kids, is that I'll trade the foo-foo surroundings and high Borgata prices for a dump off 19th Ave. someplace and the food is killer. I don't think I'll head back here any time soon I'm afraid.",

It was great on the cheese crisp. They let you mix up the tacos so you can try the variety. We ended with the mexican chocolate cake. Great end to a great anniversary.  Our server was Ganby and she is a main reason we will be back. You guys rocked it.",

The food is great too but if you ever have an issue with anything they are willing to go above and beyond for you with out you even asking for it. I remeber one time a group of friends and I went in to grab some food before going out on a sat night and at some point the server asked us if he could get us anything and we jokingly mentioned a candy bar. As we were ready to close out and our bill arrived, the server pulled out the candy that was jokingly requested! Now that's service! Stop in when you get a chance you won't regret it.",

    "text": "So when I heard my brother's friends birthday would be here, I was a little skeptical. First, I had never heard of it and second I started to research it on Yelp. I was apprehensive after reading the reviews and was worried I would be wasting my money on sub-par food. Well after going, it was not horrible, but not a life changing experience either.   I was saddened when i found out it had replaced Tanneko. I actually liked that place. We had reservations because we were a big party, so we didn't wait long. There were, however, quite a few people waiting for a while after we sat down. It was your typical north Scottsdale crowd. Every woman looked the same and every guy looked like a DB.   The food. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. It's hard to mess up. Had a couple of Dos Equis which they had on tap. They came out promptly and cold. I ordered the Carnitas tacos. They came with rice and beans. There were two tacos and you have a choice of tortilla. They were pretty good. Again, nothing spectacular. The black beans I had were good, but the rice was just like buttered white rice that someone mentioned in a previous review. My brother had the machaca burrito which was huge and he seemed to enjoy.   A couple of funny anecdotes. I think we had runners bring food for other tables to ours about 3 times. They seemed a little lost all night. Later on when the right food came, my brother asked the runner which of the two identical burritos was chicken and which was beef. The runner said, and I quote, \"Dude, they just give me the food and tell me where to take it.\" No effing joke!   Overall, you could probably skip this place and come back when it changes to some other ethnic-type food place in a year.",

This place can be succinctly summed up by that quick anecdote.  Now for the review and something completely different:  Nice casual, relaxing setting. However, the food is not that great. Ordered the Machaca tacos.  They were alright but they were definitely nothing special.  The guacamole was way overpriced for the quality, $9 for something that should be worth $5 at the most. Overall it is a fun setting, but it is not a place if you are serious about eating.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in...",

I could order bowls of this stuff (something I think I do during their happy hour since its half off) and be content with that. Their shortrib cheese crisp with avocados was equally as delish. Great flavor to the short ribs. Had their guacamole and it was wonderful again, seems to be pretty consistent. Same thing with their white peach hibiscus margarita. I could literally drink 10 of these things which will get me into trouble at some point I am sure. Blanco has great food and fun atmosphere with a hip and trendy vibe. Even the hubby enjoyed the food even though this is not his type of place. Try it, you will be a fan too   :)",

    "text": "I'm starting to think that Phoenix isn't the Mexican food mecca that people seem to think it is. My favorite place closed down over a year ago, and I've since then been on the search for something comparable. I've yet to find anything that comes even close.   Taste is very subjective, yet most people get quite defensive about their favorite Mexican place. I'm pretty sure this place won't go on the top of many people's lists though. It's not like I thought for even a second that Blanco would blow my mind, but I wasn't paying and since it was a Fox Concept (which is the new way of saying \"chain\" I guess) I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I tend to order pretty much the same thing when I hit a new Mexican joint, and I didn't stray from that this time. I like to get a cheese crisp... I know it's totally not authentic, but my mom used to make them when I was a kid. Their version of a cheese crisp was good... even less Mexican than most places, but good. Interesting type of cheese... fresh and light and not oily.  Their salsa was kinda weak, but tasted okay. It needs more flavor and more heat, but it didn't taste bad like some places. I ordered a machaca beef taco dish as well. The beef was boring and flavorless, but quality meat. Their margaritas were okay... nothing to write home about, but at least they didn't taste like a store bought mix.   The food was merely okay - at least it was edible. It's not very Mexican at all, but it's decent. The things that stands out about this place are that it's very clean and nice inside, and the staff is super friendly and good looking. It's almost to the point that I want to give it 4 stars. If the food wasn't so bland and uninspired, it would be an easy decision. I may change it later. At least I didn't go home with gut rot. I'll eat here again.",

We arrived around 7:45pm--the place was hopping and there was a 45 minute wait for a 6-person table (a good sign on a Friday night).  Luckily, upon asking the hostess about the bar situation, we found out there was open seating with a full food menu on the patio!  We snagged a great spot and surrendered our buzzer.  The patio was fantastic with great people watching and ridiculously comfortable chairs--would be a great place for day drinking.  Overall I dig the atmosphere/music/decor of this place, as well as the people and energy.  We decided it was like Sapporo but in Old Town and with Mexican food.    Our food was decent, I won't crave it but would order the green chile enchiladas again.  The salmon ceviche appetizer was probably the best thing that we ordered all night.  My one drink and one glass of water were also tasty (I asked for more water that never came, and I was not offered a second drink so it was a short night in the fluids department).    Assuming they fix their confusion with the serving situation, I would go back here again for sure.",

Our table was right between the dining room and the patio, so we were able to take advantage of the beautiful breeze without having to sit outside. What a cute restaurant- very open and chic.  We both started with the Pomegranate/Grapefruit Margarita- a great option if you like a little bit of sweetness in your marg. It was served on the rocks, so it went down pretty quickly. Following the Pom/Grape Margarita, I decided to give their Classic Margarita a shot. It tasted like it was made with real lime juice instead of boat loads of sweet and sour mix, so that was a major plus!  The chips and salsa were great. Nice, thick chips and a hearty salsa with just a touch of spice. We decided to try the Queso Fundido, as we are both huge fans of most queso dips. The server warned us that this was very different from the normal queso, but we ordered it anyways. It arrived in a small pan and was thick! It had been baked which transformed it from a diappable treat to a \"fork some onto my chip\" experience. It was also served with fresh flour tortillas which were much appreciated. The biggest downfall of this dish was the chorizo. The chorizo was slightly burnt and was dripping grease everywhere. Gross.   The drinks were great, the chips and salsa were delicious, and the menu is still full of other items I'd love to try.  Our bill for the four margaritas and the queso came out to $22- fantastic happy hour prices!",

This place was simply meh, especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in AZ where you can get a kick ass margarita for a whole lot less than $10. We ordered a couple drinks and were disappointed with all of them; consensus was that they were all too sweet and not enough tequila, the sangria tasted like juice for peets sake. The chips are a nice thicker version however the salsa is thin and flavorless. Roast those tomatoes or something, throw in some heat! Their guacamole, although a decent flavor profile, needed a lot more lime and was super blended to the texture of those nasty avocado 'dips' you find next to french onion and ranch plastic containers. We all ordered tacos of various types for dinner, I had the roasted veggie ones with a hard shell. Man these were no good. The veggies were really oily from their saute and were used sparingly; the bottom of the tacos was cabbage. Honestly, the only good thing I ate tonight was the black beans, abet a bit salty. I will say our server was very friendly however the food just don't hold water to the prices. Try Tia Rosas in Mesa for some excellent mexican food and margaritas worth their $8 and more in tequila.",

I wouldn't come back here for food or a margarita but the atmosphere was nice. Oh, also the only hot sauce they have is a Tabasco or Choulula. Usually Mexican inspired places have a special house made hot sauce. Way better restos in Scottsdale for tacos and guac.",

There seems to be plenty of tables so it can handle crowds. Most servers are young people it's very modern inside with loud music. We really enjoyed everything we ordered. Guacamole wasn't spicy which I liked but others didn't and the street corn had a nice taste and everyone liked it. We all ordered tacos and decided the barbecue pulled pork was the best and the seafood ones were least liked only because they were bland. I had the grilled avocado ones and I really liked them. Desserts were ok with the Mexican chocolate cake bring the one we liked best. The bill was not bad at all either. Highly recommend.",

We sat at the bar and I was a bit surprised that it was as empty as it was. Especially with Game 7 of the NBA finals going on.   We ordered a drink and some queso. Before the drinks arrived we both looked at each other and mentioned how warm it was. It was 120* out today and a cold drink was just what the doctor ordered. Well, the doctor must have called out sick. Along with the AC guy. Yep. We mentioned the temperature to the bartender and he kind of chuckled and said 'well, our AC is broken. That's when we asked for the check and cashed out.   My Tito's and Tonic was weak. There was only half an inch of melted ice in the top of the glass and the drink was slightly room temperature. Their ice machine must have gone out with the AC.",

He empathized with me, mentioned they are working with Postmates to correct some mistakes on their menu, and had the kitchen remake the items that were incorrect. He then DROVE THE FOOD TO MY HOUSE as a courtesy. I know this review isn't about the food or restaurant in particular, but I think service is one of the most important parts of a successful Restaurant. Clearly Sam Fox feels the same way. Nate exceeded my expectations, and offered a great example on how to take care of people. Thanks again!",

He had a few tables too so that could have been why. I do have to say they didn't mess up one order which was very impressive.  We ordered a bunch of food but the food was just ok for me and the majority of our party. We all agreed that the BBQ taco was delicious. I had the carne asada and grilled fish tacos too. Both were good but lacked flavor, nothing really stood out for me on those outside of that. A few people had the crispy shrimp tacos and said they were tasty.   All said and done, would I go out of my way to eat here again? Prob not as there are better places in the valley to hit up, however I would make a repeat visit to try something different.",

By the time we got our food it was ice cold THEN she never came back to us to see if it tasted okay and when we asked for a refill from the bar (because she neglected our table due to socializing with other co workers) she walked up to us angry and rude as if we did something wrong by asking the bar tender for a refill on our sodas. To top it all offHer breath stunk of alcohol. We will not be back to this location ever again I can tell you that!",

Maybe that's how they do it around there, but they were all super nice and made great recommendations.  We did order street corn as a starter, but it didn't come out until after our entrees were out. (They took it off the bill without even I having to ask, so that's kudos to the waitress).  The blood orange margarita was good (not a flavor explosion like most reviews state), the tiger shrimp fajitas were delicious, and I had mix-and-match tacos. I got the \"award winning\" bbq pork, mahi, and chipotle mango shrimp. All tacos had some really good flavor (my fav was the mahi).  I give this place 3/5 because it was good, but nothing that I would need to drive back to all the way from Gilbert. It was just meh to me!!",

    "text": "I'm SO freaking bummed this place isn't in LA.  We were in Scottsdale for my fiance's conference and needed some food the night before we left. After much debate and not a lot of help from Yelp's \"nearby\", we decided to grab whatever was closest to a Starbucks we went to get coffee at. This turned out to be Blanco.   SADLY (I'M SO BUMMED) we had our Shiba pup with us and couldn't leave him alone in the hotel room-think apocalypse except with more teeth marks-so we had to order to-go which meant... no margaritas... no margaritas....... :( I even tried to DoorDash it since they sometimes Dash alcohol! No luck.  We were starving so we ordered over the phone: one carne asada burrito enchilada style, one green chile pork enchilada, one red chile chicken cheese crisp, and an order of their street corn.  Upon entering, the hostesses were friendly and directed me to the bar to pay and pick-up my order. I was honestly super lost because the bar was in the center of the restaurant, near where the food was coming out, and it looked like everyone there was busy making drinks and not organizing take out. I kept looking around and looking around like an idiot and finally a guy (maybe the manager?) asked if I needed help. YES PLEASE. He helped me get my bill paid for.  The two of us split everything and it was a ton of food. The street corn was soooo good, and I'm totally making it at home now.  The cheese crisp is basically a pizza on a tortilla. It had cilantro, onion, tomatoes, poblano, and shredded red chile chicken. No complaints here except it was a little cold by the time we got back to our room.  The enchilada came with a side of rice and beans (charro), and the beans may be the most delicious pinto beans I've ever had. They taste slightly meaty which was amazing mixed into the rice. The pork in the enchilada was super tender and slightly fatty, definitely a nice roasted pork shoulder.   The burrito was pretty darn good too. The carne asada was hearty, was in fairly big pieces, and tasted like really fresh, quality meat. A lot of Mexican places nearby chop up the asada so small it falls out all over the place and is over-seasoned with lime. This asada was on point.  The order also came with super crispy chips and salsa!   Gosh I'm so bummed, I'm in love with this place already and I haven't even had a margarita... Oh and the dog loved the beans and rice too.",

Or so close to we waited five minutes :) The bartenders were AMAZING and so nice! We both started with a classic marg, eh, skip and go for the fun stuff (read below!) (oh, must also say, this place is nice, open, clean and I love the kitchen is open as well as the dining area and bar area, loud but fun). The Margs were whatever...just the mix they use, it could be better. Here is what could not be better...the pastor chicken?! Yeah? What? That's a thing?Um Hum....It happens here and it happens to be perfectly amazing! Every bit of greatness you want in a bite from texture to sweet, to salty to bold along with spice....yup...umami. Not to mention whatever a Oaxacan Shandy Cocktail is soooooo good(get one!!!)! So Their tacos rock, quesadillas are stupid great huge and so good and the service is amazing. Kitchen was slow and I wish they had a less chunky salsa, otherwise five solid stars for sure :) visit was at 3:00 on 3/27/20 BEE&Doc :)",

Several other tables had kids and the staff was really great at dealing with them. The food:  - bowl of chips were crunchy and warm - A - I'm not sure why kid quesadilla and taco came with fries. Would prefer beans or rice. Both were fine - B+ - choice of three tacos- crispy shrimp and red chili chicken. Both were good and chicken had a nice kick- A- - fajitas were ok. Again, why no beans and rice? -B+   Biggest disappointment was with the classic margarita. Couldn't taste the tequila and about 75% ice. Overall some minor missteps but I would go back for an enjoyable night out where we felt \"like the cool kids\" even with our own in tow",

    "text": "I was pretty disappointed in the whole experience. My son selected Blanco and we all arrived on a Wednesday evening for his girlfriend's birthday dinner. A one hour wait (they don't take reservations) for a table for 4 suggests this is a great restaurant but I found it lacking for a number of reasons: 1. The place was dirty. Food, wrappers, trash on the floor throughout the place 2. Elbowed our way up to the very crowded bar and ordered margaritas and nachos to hold us over. Bartender was very pleasant and pretty quick to serve our drinks. But the food took forever. Then they served it with no napkins, plates or utensils. With the crowded bar, it was difficult -- and very messy -- to share.  3. When we were finally seated, the servers were pleasant but again, the kitchen was so slow. 40 minutes from order placed to plates in front of us. All dishes were tasty but not really worth the wait. Plus, they weren't really up to temp. Ironically, the waiter warned us about very hot plates but they weren't. So the food wasn't either. Nothing worse than room temp fish tacos! 4. I had an iced tea and due to the long wait for dinner, I required a few refills along the way. Unfortunately, they kept refilling my glass with warm tea and I couldn't get their attention to get more ice. How hard is it to serve cold drinks? Others had a beer and might have ordered more but we couldn't get anyone to slow down and take another order.   One compliment -- service staff is friendly and we got many thank yous along the way. They've obviously focused staff training on positive interactions w/customers. But the kitchen can't keep up with the crowd.   I wouldn't go back.",

My husband and I dined here during a visit before moving to Arizona and the fact that we were able to eat outside on the patio in December was such a wow factor to us, coming from Michigan. This location off of Scottsdale Road has two garage doors that stay open most of the year which allows for a nice breeze and open aired dining.   Food - delicious! Tex-Mex flavors are on point and flavorful.   Ambience - love! Bar is in the center of the restaurant and they have two separate patios with outdoor seating. Fun, upbeat environment.    Service - excellent!  Never had a bad server, they've always gone above and beyond.   What I didn't realize is this is another Fox Concept Restaurant -- and once again they've done an outstanding job. Great spot!",

I always get the hibiscus green tea or the homemade lemonade when I come here for lunch they are both very refreshing.  The bowls and tacos are excellent, but my all time favorite is their fajitas.  Although, I was extremely disappointed when I came back here after a month to find out they took off the combo option for the fajitas that you could select two different meats.  Please bring this back as I enjoy both your chicken and carne asada!   On a Saturday afternoon at the Scottsdale location our server was not that attentive and our drinks were not refilled till we were basically leaving.  I have had better service from the Biltmore location I have to say.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good fresh Mexican food.",

    "text": "Another solid experience at Blanco! As a part of restaurant week, I stopped by Blanco...mainly just because I have been craving the delicious tacos, but then I remembered that it's restaurant week, so one entree turned into a three course dinner. Am I complaining? Absolutely not.   We started with the guacamole and avocado and pork cheese crisp. As usual, both were excellent. Their cheese crisps are amazing. I tried the veggie crisp during a previous visit. Phenomenal. Everyone should order it. So moving on to the entrees, even though we were stuffed to the brim after the guac and crisp, we tried the fish tacos and pork enchiladas. While the fish tacos were tasty and the norm, the pork enchiladas blew anything else out of the water.The pork is lean and fresh and sitting in gooey cheese, sauce and within a crunchy taco. It comes with a creamy rice and pico. Excellent.   To wash it down, I sipped on my favorite skinny margarita cocktail. I think they mix their skinny marg with sour and soda water and maybe with a hint of sprite? Whatever they do, it makes a fair weather margarita fan into a full pledged fan immediately!   Waiter Jeremy was pleasant, friendly and completely attentive! The staff at Blanco are top notch. I know that when I visit, I'm in good hands and Jeremy confirmed this with the service tonight!",

We made a reservation for about 13 people and ended up waiting almost 30-45min past our scheduled reservation time to be seated.   Once we were finally seated, then came the ordering. With me being on such a strict diet, I was a bit skeptical about finding anything on the menu. I ended up ordering the Blanco Chopped Salad. which on the menu is described as \"Grilled Chicken, Seasonal Fruits, Pepitas (pumpkin seeds)\" for $9. Sounds tastey right? Well before ordering it, I did ask the server if the 'salad' had lettuce in it, and he assured me it was lush mixed greens with mixed fruit, chicken, pepitas and a cilantro lime dressing. \"Perfect!\" Well that's not what I got.  Apparently mixed seasonal fruits meant just apples and there was tomatos chopped up in it. Now understand, tomatos are considered a fruit, but when you read seasonal fruits, a tomato is the last thing on my mind. They were totally reaching there. And when I read fruits, I'm assuming more than 2. FAIL.  Needless to say, I came in with no expecations and walked away completely disappointed.   I usually try and make one more attempt to go back to make a confirmed judgement, but this first visit literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "This place is fine. Average. Nothing spectacular. But not remotely authentic either, like most of Sam Fox's restaurants. They're all absolutely satisfactory, but if you are looking to be blown away by flavorful and inventive dishes, go somewhere else, cuz it aint gonna happen here.  Went Sunday night for restaurant week with 5 of my friends, and I will say we were blown away by the amount of food they give you for $19 a person. I plowed through my fair share of chips and salsa, which was pretty bland I'll add and was stuffed halfway through my first course.  The decor of the restaurant was cute. I couldn't believe how massive the bar was though! Apparently this is the place to go if you are a tequila drinker. Dozens and dozens of different brands/flavors of tequila. Sadly I am not a tequila so this aspect was entirely wasted on me. I did however have a White Peach & HIbiscus flavored margarita which was sweet but delightful. I would like to point out though that at $9, this margarita cost almost 50% of what my 3 course restaurant week menu did.   Out of all the dishes that I tasted, the tortilla soup was by far the winner of the appetizers, the 3 bites that I could get down of my Shrimp Fajitas were actually pretty tasty, and everyone was pleased with their desserts minus a few moldy raspberries that were thrown on my friend's Tres Leches cake...ick. That said, pretty much the entire restaurant and kitchen staff came over and apologized for said raspberry so the rebound and recovery was nice.  Probably wouldn't go back unless someone else really wanted to and they of course were paying for all of my $9 margaritas, but if you wanted a safe, non-spicy, Scottsdale-version of a Mexican restaurant to take your parents or other out of town guests, this should certainly fit your bill.",

We definitely felt well taken care of.  My complaints, and why it only gets a 3-star from me is the food was just \"ok\". The best thing we had was the chips and salsa which were really good, but we all got different kinds of tacos and no one was really impressed. Everything was a little bland for supposed Mexican food. We all ended up pouring the decent enough salsa on our tacos to kick them up a notch.  Also, when we first arrived it was before happy hour and we all ordered a different specialty margarita and they were all really good. So on our next round we were informed that happy hour had begun and the Margs were now half price!! Great news right?! Unfortunately not, it seems half price = half the booze too :(  Personally, I hate a sweet under-boozed margarita I'd rather pay full price then drink that crap! My recommendation if you're there to enjoy happy hour prices is to ordered a beer.",

We ordered the green chili pork enchilada and a trio of tacos:  crispy shrimp,  fish and carne asada.  We started with an appetizer of of street corn.  All complemented by their classic margarita. The chips and salsa that comes to the table when seated were really quite good, and the margaritas and street corn were excellent.  Of the main dishes, only the crispy shrimp was excellent.  The carne asada was OK, but the fish was very fishy and unpleasant.  Their pork enchilada was a layered version in a pan, and it was tasty, but not particularly outstanding.",

We sat at a table which was connected to the bar which ended up being a great thing!  We asked our waiter, Tony, what he would recommend.  He told us how several items were prepared and what items went best with other items.  We went with his recommendations and they were a hit!  Rob seamlessly tagged team with him and brought out additional  items.  Both guys were very cool and they were very  knowledgeable about their food, company, and the Scottsdale area.  I never sit at the bar, but my wife and I would recommend sitting there just to talk with the fellas!",

    "text": "Blanco is one Sam Foxy modern Mexican restaurant. I just love the interior's bluish, brownish, orange-y color scheme and the comfy outdoor patio containing mood enhancing fire pits. Hey Sam, can I borrow your Foxy interior design team to come dress-up my home? They seriously know their stuff.  Beyond my admiration of Blanco's interior and exterior design, I think this is one concept that Sam got right. By no means is this restaurant even remotely authentic, but it's not supposed to be. Good old uncle Sam doesn't do authentic. Sam does Americanized and trendy best. Even the name Blanco fits the whitewashed, or should I say Blancowashed, menu.    Sam tossed Chipotle's bland food, a taco truck, a wood-fire grill, Latin cocktails, trendy decor, and a Scottsdale scene into a blender, and Voila! He whipped up the perfect Blancoshake that brings all the boys and girls to Blanco's yard - setting the stage for some seriously entertaining, and enjoyably funny, people watching.  How's the service? Fantastic! I'm always well taken care of from the drink refills to the mid-meal table check-ins. The friendly wait staff and welcoming hostesses are all on top of their game, and even attractively well dressed. Big surprise, right? I know a couple guys who outright admit that they love Blanco for those polo dresses that the hostesses wear (an FYI for the dudes out there).   What's my favorite Blanco dish? That would be the Shrimp Fajitas. Cooked on wood-fire grill and combined with caramelized onions and peppers, the plump shrimp have this smoky, charred and blackened taste. The accompanying rice, beans and tortillas aren't anything to write home about though. All 3 taste like Chipotle's bland food. Matt always makes fun of me because I order the Shrimp Fajitas but I just eat the shrimp fajita mix with my fork. I don't even make a real fajita. It's just not worth the extra effort. Those shrimpies are too delish to be combined with just blandness.   What else to I recommend on the menu? You must try the tacos! All the meat & seafood is cooked to perfection on that wood-fire grill I love oh so much. In fact, without that grill, I don't think the menu would be as tasty.   I also must say that their Margaritas are fruity, and their Mojitos are yummy to sip on. All the cocktails are pretty much standard Sam Fox concoctions.   And what about the nachos? Oh yeah, those are scrumptious too! Actually, all of the appetizers have got it goin on. Cheese Crips - salty, melty, cheesy and crunchy. Ceviche - fresh, spicy, tangy, limey and juicy. Guacamole - perfectly seasoned, chunky and fresh avocados coupled with rock salt crystals and flavorful cotija cheese.   In fact, that guacamole is so intensely good it feels like a ripe green avocado punches my taste buds with every bite. Blanco's avocados are packing serious flavor.   What menu item should you skip? Pass on the Salmon a la Parrilla. It's just weird and at $18 bucks it did anything but impress. The salmon wasn't fresh or flaky enough, and the accompanying spinach, squash and corn mixed with chile verde was bland with a strange aftertaste. Trust me, you are wayyyyy better off with a plate of tacos or fajitas, and you'll get a boatload more food for the same price or less.  Overall, Blanco's atmosphere fits any occasion and any sized group. So... give Blanco a go!",

We had the dip sampler for only 3 bucks and it was a decent amount of each of the dips (guac, bean dip, and queso). My husband and I each had three of the street tacos - you can mix and match - and they were delicious. I believe they were around ten dollars for the three of them. Our drinks were delicious, too! I had the sangria and the margarita. Overall, great restaurant, awesome food/drinks, and wonderful service! We will definitely be back soon!",

Their margarita was incredible!! If you like margaritas, do yourself a favor and grab one of these. My fiance and I went here twice and the first time we sat inside and had great customer service.   The second time (and the reason for 3 stars) we sat outside and we're almost forgotten by our waiter. I felt like every time we needed him he was no where to be found (and the place wasn't very busy). Also, I decided to try a mixed drink this time around and it was awful. It had so much alcohol I couldn't even drink it. It tasted like a shot (and yes I stirred it well)! I immediately very politely told the waiter it was too strong and he still charged us for it!! Which I thought was rude and not the best customer service. Other than that experience, the place is pretty good.",

It started out with a parking lot that didn't have enough room for parking - on a Monday...I was forced into valet parking which was ok but totally ridiculous on a Monday night. We were seated right away and then we waited and waited  and waited for a waitress. She finally came over and was friendly enough but seemed overwhelmed by her customer base. We ordered drinks right away and an appetizer. The guacamole came out right away and was pretty good. Then we waited, and waited, and waited for our drinks. We ordered a second appetizer (queso) and received it before our drinks came. Only one problem - no chips. So again, we waited and waited and waited for chips.   **We considered leaving before ordering dinner and wished we would have.**   Our drinks finally came out and we ordered dinner and finally got some chips. Then AGAIN, we waited, and waited - you get the drill. Our waitress avoided eye contact and she spent half of her time at the computer doing who knows what. No manager to be seen anywhere - no idea who was running this place. Food arrived and it was alright, nothing special. The service was so bad we will without a doubt never be back.   The valet parking attendant was the highlight of our night - nice, fast and courteous - even if it was unnecessary - like the horrible service we received at the restaurant. My advice - go to a local Mexican food restaurant - skip this place.  Updated 5/5: Owner sent me a private note about my experience. Classy move and much appreciated. Apologized and said they were going to look into the issues. Thank you.",

The hostess was friendly, greeted us right away and sat us right in front of the tv that was playing the 49er game. Was it our San Francisco gear that gave us away?   Our waiter was nice, although I don't think he likes kids in his every day life, he handled it well. He was prompt on refills, checking in with us often, even giving us great recommendations. We all loved the food, many smiles all around.     I was glad we chose Blanco's for dinner tonight, it was everything I hoped it would be. Next time, I'm trying one of their margaritas. :)",

It really needs to have a little sweet taste to make it more drinker friendly.  The hostesses seem confused about which seats are inside and which seats are outside.  We requested outside and then asked to be seated on the side where the sun wasn't in your face and they took us to an inside table.  When I reminded her we had requested outside which is why we were waiting she seemed to have a light bulb go on and took us out to one of 3 available tables.  Inside is very noisy with concrete floors and high ceilings.  The Waiter was either poorly trained or just not capable.of making good decisions.  I watched him pass by our table 3 or 4 times when we were waiting for a first drink.  I also watched him go take orders from 2 separate tables of 5 while my husband held his credit card and bill out for the Waiter to see was ready.  The icing on the cake was actually a piece of paper towel in my husband's Spanish rice! This place is destined to fail if management doesn't get a pretty quick handle on all these issues.  I feel it's my civic duty to protect others from a similar experience",

The hostess was frumpy, the interior was noisy, lacked any charm at all, and still had much of the left over design from the Japanese restaurant that used to be there and went out of business. As for the food, the chips were run of the mill, the salsa was AWFUL (what canned prepared salsa are they buying? Certainly nothing fresh like the many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale!) The Mahi tacos were TINY, over salted, and dry. The Carne Asada and Short Rib tacos were also very tiny, greasy meat, and not much on flavor.  Bear in mind the 3 tiny tacos are $18. I would never recommend this restaurant to a local resident or a tourist .",

It means that you're not going to find traditional taco shop grub here. Good news is that that's not a bad thing. Although some menu items may seem a little too upscale for Mexican food, I suggest throwing your preconceptions out the window and trying something new. The black beans are absolutely amazing! If you're not feeling too adventurous, try a burrito bowl.",

I can only speak on the happy hour aspect of this place since we tore it up here for their amazing happy hour! We started off with getting some super low priced happy hour margaritas that weren't your basic margarita in a glass. I got the hibiscus flower which was up there as one of my personal favorite margaritas I've ever had! I topped that off with a pint of a local Mexican lager which was also delicious. I personally didn't get to try much food but I did get their happy hour nachos. The nachos for the price was actually pretty filling and for the price not your basic $4 nachos! I will definitely be back here for happy hour if I get my Mexican food cravings and I find myself in this part of Scottsdale!",

We were seated at our table really quickly, despite it being a Saturday around dinner time (although we did have a reservation, so that probably helped). Our waiter was really nice, and helpful answering menu questions we had. I ordered their classic Margarita (which was nice, decent amount of alcohol- some places tend to short you, and you're left with more mixture, if you get what I mean). Anywho, we had chips and salsa for our app, followed by the entrees. It took no time at all for our food to arrive which was great. I got the 3 (award winning!) BBQ pulled pork tacos with rice and beans, and my husband got the carne asada burrito (not enchilada wet sauce style). Food was awesome! The meat was juicy and tender, the sides were plentiful and filling. Perfect amount of food and the quality for the price (in my opinion).   Overall, A+ for service and food! I guess I'm so used to the restaurants in Los Angeles taking forever to get the customer served etc, that the extent of service here was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. If I'm ever here in the near future (or the next time I'm in the area, rather), I definitely plan to visit- highly recommended!",

This restaurant could make twice as much money and have happier customers if they would train the hostesses on how to manage the seating. They stand there like Stepford wives with a glazed look. They tell you it will be 20 minutes for a table when you can see 4 empty tables. Rather than wipe off the table themselves, they just stand there and keep adding names to the list and keep going around and counting the empty tables. A terrible first impression of this place. No one to help our server pre bus the table or clear off the all of the empty tables around us. No concept of overall great customer service. Very disappointed in Fox Restaurants.  I appreciate management being open to input about service and following up with me. I will return.",

Mexicans don't use mayo in their enchilada sauce. Plus there's a glob or sour cream on top... makes no sense. I literally couldn't eat it, it was like eating spoonfuls of mayo..  Shrimp and steak fajitas.. if u like Applebee's... there's we're ok.. at least they didn't taste like mayo...  Queso with beef. Literally the only thing out of drink, enchiladas and fajitas that we were able to eat and semi enjoy.  Do not go here. The big sign should be warning enough. There is way too much good Mexican food in Arizona to waste your money and time at this place. The enchilada sauce was a DISGRACE!!!!",

It's fresh and flavorful and a good accompaniment to the chips and salsa. The cheese crisps are a must- kind of a Mexican flatbread the size of a medium pizza. The street tacos were good- tiny, but good! Several unique drink options are on the menu. The mixed berry marg seemed to be the crowd favorite. Give Blanco a shot if you're in the mood for Mexican!",

Other than that, really enjoyed the service. Servers were always friendly, and the food was consistently good. Tried the short rib burrito,  carne asada burrito, Chipotle shrimp, street corn. Enjoyed all of the above. Would come back.",

The first thing that will catch your eye is their tortillas that look n taste so fresh!!! Our fave tacos were the shredded beef then chicken and last carnitas.  Their churros were also very good, they come with a chocolate sauce, I think just plain were delish. Will definitely come back and try more tacos. Finally service was superb, every single member who worked there treated you like they were happy to see you, which explains why this place is always busy.",

    "text": "Visited last night spur of the moment decision was able to get a sitter and was craving Mexican but wanted to try something new, so we pounded our heads together and decided to visit Blanco.  This was our first visit and for a Wednesday this place was full,we were greeted by a friendly Manager who wass helping at the desk for a bit to manage the wait, we were quoted 30-40 minutes and decided we would head to the bar to get a drink while we wait. The two girls behind the bar were very busy and could of used a third, they were having a tough time keeping up but were still friendly, however with one girl in the well getting buried that left only the one to handle the crowd and guests at the bar, with that said they were able to get my order we had a beer and a margarita and both were great... beer was cold and margarita was very good!   We checked out the place very modern with good Latin/Hispanic music in the back ground with a cool open kitchen.After about 30 minutes our pager went off and we were escorted to our table. We were greeted promptly by our server Justin ( I believe that was his name) he was professional and curtious and had all the answers to our questions.  We had to try a cheese crisp, because that how we always do it, not my favorite but not bad...We couldn't make up our mind so we decided to do the fajita combo. Different compared to most on the presentation but the chicken and steak were both great. The chicken and steak must be prepared on a grill because they have a smokey flavor to them, possible mesquite.   Over all glad we stopped in and will make it back soon.....",

Hostess seated us but then no one came over for over ten minutes. Decided to try the white peach hibiscus margarita. Sadly, it was syrupy and not worth 9 bucks.   My enchiladas were kinda gross. Chicken was watery, not juicy and cheese was piled on. The sauce lacked its usual kick.   Rice on side was like eating a stick of butter. Table chips were the saltiest I've had in a long time. My husband had fish tacos he said were \"fine\". He is much more enthusiastic about fish tacos usually.  Kids meals were acceptable for kids. Kind of odd they give kids adult size take out cups. Anyway, it's a nice ambiance. I'd stick to beer or wine happy hour but couldn't recommend this location.",

Very refreshing!! ~Grilled Fish Taco - 3 stars - nice presentation and good. ~Beef 'House Specialty' Enchilada - 1 star... the meat was way too salty, and I guess it was so special that just don't expect this to be your normal enchilada from anywhere...quite disappointed on this house special ~Tres Leche Cake - 3.5 stars - it was decent with some whipped cream and strawberries on top, but the cake wasn't so soaked and the cinnamon taste was too strong....  I'd visit again just for some chips and ceviche!!",

Luckily, when we arrived around 7:15 pm, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get seated.  And we must've lucked out, because our service was prompt and attentive.  The guacamole is a perfect appetizer to share... and the chips and salsa are worth the splurge.  I shared a Caesar Salad to start, and that was quite tasty as well.  I was debating what to order for the main course and when I asked the waitress about the salmon she said she didn't eat seafood but that she's been told the salmon is 'buttery.'  Buttery salmon?  Really?  That didn't sell me on ordering the salmon, but it was what I went with after all.  And although I would not describe it as buttery, I will say it was good.  It was a generous serving as well, so I didn't mind when Jared started eating it off my plate.  The rice with veggies that it was served with was also tasty.  Overall, Blanco didn't blow me away, but I am sure I'll return sometime.  You can't go wrong popping in for a drink or two and some chips, salsa, and guac in a trendy atmosphere.",

Usually I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa, but this is the exception. The salsa was good, but I like salty salsa.  I don't really like if it's the least bit sweet.  And I hate the real thick hard tortilla chips. This place had thick chips and the salsa was a bit sweet. But EVERYTHING else was mind blowingly good. I ordered the crispy shrimp tacos on corn tortillas with rice and pinto charro beans. OMG!! I've had hundreds of shrimp and fish tacos and these were the best I've ever had. And even though the rice was simple with just some cooked green onions and corn seasoning it...it was so incredible. It had a buttery succulent flavor to it. Ron had the beef short rib nachos and he was in heaven. They only serve Pepsi products here so I got the black passion fruit iced tea and it was amazing. I took some home with me. It's was a beautiful day and the open air layout of the place was gorgeous.  There are two patios, the place has 4 tvs for keeping up with the game.  I gave my compliments to the general manager, Chelsea and told her that we were destined to become good friends because this is my new place.  Great service, even better food and a lovely atmosphere.",

Another couple we went with got the carnitas burrito and loved it as well.  To top it all off, our waitress (though now I have forgotten her name, of course) was absolutely delightful.

This really isn't a 'joint', rather a 'scene'.  It's not a total douchebag scene like you'd get in Old Town (I live there, so I can say that); but it is more of an upscale Mexican place.  Not as fancy pants as The Mission, but not Frank and Lupe's....  However, it's just a little too pricey for what you get.  All of us got the tacos.  Bonus, they have quite a variety of street tacos and for $1 extra you can mix and match.  I did the spicy beef, fish, and carne asada.  Whew, the beef WAS spicy. Very flavorful. The fish tacos were rather bland, and the carne asada was my favorite.  It was the size that threw us. So tiny.  They were the size of the palm of my hand, and I'm little.  I will say that the black beans and rice were delicious. Had I not ate my weight in chips and guac, I wouldn't have been as full.  I also had the pomegranite/grapefruit margarita and it was delicious.  Great balance between sweet and bitter. Yum. The hibiscus margarita was a little too sweet for me, but if you like it on the sweet side.. go for it.",

Drinks came quickly, we ordered some guac - we were off to a great start.  Then came the first lull.  When the guac was dropped off, we ordered food and my hubby ordered another margarita.  We had to waive someone down to ask for some more (full-sized) chips.  Guac was okay, nothing special.  Then we waited, and waited, and no one brought his drink.  We stopped our waitress to ask for some more salsa.  10 minutes later, our entrees came - no drink for my hubby, no salsa.  Waitress came by again, grabbed the empty salsa bowl, and I ordered another drink.  Those were all dropped off and we didn't see anyone else until we were ready to go.  Even then it wasn't our waitress - it was another girl who dropped off containers and the check.  We were slightly surprised at the price of the check - it's scottsdale but still...Food was decent but nothing special (think Chipotle at a full service restaurant).

    "text": "5 stars! I love this place and I continue to go back all the time! This is by far my favorite fox concept restaurant. I decided to write this review due to my experience last Night. (Being a busy Friday night) I had just gotten off of work, the entire time being at work I couldn't help but crave and fantasize about Blanco's guac (my fav) so therefore I made myself a promise to get some after work to for-fill my craving. As arriving to the place I had realized how busy It was, not surprising considering they always have good business due to their awesomeness. As I walked in I was even more overwhelmed by the crowd and how hard everyone was working. I talked to kind gentleman who I explained I just wanted to get some guac and chips to go and he explained how I could go to the bar and they'll help me out there! (Perfect no problem most restaurants work this way, I know this because I work in the industry) I then walked over to the bar just to realize It was very crowded I felt awkward and in the way, so at this point I was feeling quite stressed and hangry. It only took about maybe a minute for the kind gentleman that I talked to earlier to rush to my rescue and becoming my guac super hero and saving the day. When he found out I had not been checked out he took initiative and made my dreams come True. He took It upon himself to check me out and do what others could not. A BIG THANK YOU TO NATE!!!!!!!!! Dear FCR he needs more praise and recognition for his hard work and hospitality he definitely impressed me and considering this type of qualities you teach in your employees I think he definitely deserves an extra something special for exceeding these expectations. THANKS AGAIN!! As far as blancos goes they have amazing food and I have never had a bad experience BUT THIS ONE BLEW me away for the amazing service Nate had granted me wish I could give him 6 stars if only that was a thing",

    "text": "Okay okay so I'm obsessed with Blanco. It's not my fault. Everything is amazing and I come here at least once a month... At least.  The margaritas are fresh, I like the Blood orange and the Mango jalapeno. Their blended sangria is great too, I don't love the red sangria but when it's mixed with the white, it's really good!  The queso is a must order. I recently I had 5 friends in town and obviously I brought them to Blanco for our first meal- everyone was talking about the queso all weekend. The guac is also pretty good.   Entrees- I used to order the green chili pork enchiladas every time I came in. They are amazing, I highly recommend. Lately, I have be into Mexican chopped salad with steak. The combination of ingredients in this salad are perfect. My boyfriend is into the tacos and is obsessed with the corn they serve here. I don't eat corn but apparently it's delicious.  I really prefer this Blanco over the location at the Biltmore. Something about the Scottsdale location is just better.  Go to Blanco yall- I'm so serious, you can thank me later!",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I decided on 2 stars with the highlights being atmosphere, impeccable service, and delicious sangria.   Now- the lowlights. The tacos were pretty good but not great. I tried the original carnitas (best), chipotle shrimp (decent, shrimp was obviously frozen), and the short rib (short ribs were dry despite the sour cream and pico de gallo).   The absolute worst piece of the meal was the appetizer we ordered. We got the seafood ceviche which had scallops, shrimp, and mahi mahi. Sounds great right?? WRONG. It is a crime to serve this outside of a Red Lobster. The frozen shrimp was the least of the offensive. The scallops were rubbery, the orange segments (apparently what the chef thought should act as the main citrus) were CANNED. They were huge and uniform in size. Could it get worse, you ask? Let me assure you- it can. The mahi mahi was served at the bottom of the serving dish as 1 large filet. And it was cooked? Did anyone bother to be educated on what ceviche is? Not only was it cooked, it was overcooked to the point that it tasted like rubber. I couldn't even cut it with my fork. The only reason I went back in for more than 1 bite was because we waited 90 minutes for a table (wait time quoted at 45 min) and I was starving.   I would give 1 star for the tacos and sangria, it's at least worth that, and honestly our server gave 5 star service. Too bad the food couldn't compete. If you go here, stay as far away from the ceviche as possible.",

    "text": "Eek - I accidentally logged in with Facebook and it created a new account...please forgive my double entry.I will delete the other review.   My husband and I are new to Scottsdale and decided to try Blanco a couple weeks ago. We went on a Friday and did not have reservations. It was super crowded, of course, but the hostesses assured us that the wait was no more than 40 minutes.   We waited 45 minutes and noticed that there were still several people ahead of us due to people lingering at their tables longer than usual. Since we had already waited 45 minutes, we continued to wait. The hostesses and manager were very kind to everyone waiting, bringing around complimentary beverages and providing status on the wait. There were parties with reservations that showed up late so that caused some more waiting and after over an hour, we were seated in a lovely part of the restaurant.  The manager came over and apologized several times for our wait and thanked us for being so patient (others weren't). We should've made reservations and understood the wait process so there was no need for apologies, but they were greatly appreciated. We were provided with a free appetizer of chips and queso - it was DELICIOUS and a total surprise!   The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic and our meals of enchiladas and fajitas was mouth-watering. The service was impeccable and the servers were very kind, attentive and knowledgeable of their menu. This restaurant really cares about their clientele.   I strongly recommend this restaurant and look forward to the cooler weather when we can go back and sit on their patio.   **PLEASE NOTE: If you visit, I urge you to make reservations. This is a super popular place and you don't want to wait, even though, IMO, it's worth the wait.  **I broke my own rule and rated this a 5 star right out the gate on the first visit. My reason being - the great customer service. Customer service like this is rare especially in a super busy establishment. They more than earned their 5 - well done Blanco!**",

Queso fundido was different and not in a good way from the past three times ordered -- way less chorizo and way more onions than usual, which means we won't be ordering it again.  My tacos were yummy, I got pork green chili, chicken, and crispy shrimp with black beans and rice and was very satisfied.  One of our companions got the steak chopped salad and thought it was tough and chewy and a poorer cut of meat than usual (she gets it every time)  so the quality seems to be going down, which is sad because we've always loved Blanco's.  It will be a while before we try again.",

    "text": "Lunch, last Saturday, was pretty much a complete flop.  First let me say that the food was okay but only just. I had a nice piece of salmon, excellently prepared BUT the accompanying \"fresh gilled vegetables\" were served in such a fine dice, it made both taste and identification impossible.  Who dices grilled vegetables? My dining companion chose three tacos, different varieties, and also thought they were good.  Disdaining the rice and beans, she was informed that she could have two \"sides of your choice.\" Side No. one was (unfortunately) the same indecipherable grilled vegetables, previously mentioned; side two was Mexican Street corn, that - while good - did not live up to what is served in various other restaurants, plus she was charged extra.  Not a big deal but no mention of it was made, by the server.  The REAL disappointment was in the cocktails.  A margarita?  Oh no, it wasn't! Mine was ordered on the rocks, NO sweet and sour, extra lime.  They actually got that part right BUT where was the tequila? My companion ordered hers frozen and if I thought my cocktail was light, hers was a barely-flavored sno-cone.  Attempting to fix this, we asked the waiter for a shot of tequila. He offered to bring us the menu and began extolling the merits of various brands, when we halted him and said no, just the Cuervo Silver, same as in (?) the cocktails.  He returned with not one but two shots - which actually turned out okay, as they were both needed. The original cocktail was priced at $8.50.  The shots were $6.00 apiece!  For Cuervo! Anyhow, that brought the price of each cocktail up to a whopping $14.50.  Believe me, there are a lot better places to go, that serve superb no-doctoring-needed margaritas, for less money.  The bartender - let me rephrase that - the person behind the bar (who looked about 12 and what was with the pen, behind the ear? going for nerdy?) lacks training and experience and that bartender presence, that only comes with knowing what you are doing.",

    "text": "We are here on a trip from Dallas, so we're no strangers to Mexican food. Looked for a place to eat on a Sunday night, and my girlfriend's family here recommended this place. Anyways, we walked in, were greeted by nice hostesses, and told it would be a 30 minute wait. We weren't that concerned since the next closest Mexican restaurant had a 45 minute wait. Plus they have a nice area to wait outside.       On to the drinks. They have unlimited chips and salsa which is always a plus. We all had waters, however her aunt ordered a sangria. She said it tasted a little weird and didn't have fruit in it because they used juices or something. She decided to get another drink I can't remember what it was but she liked it.       Now the food. I wasn't too hungry and just ordered a cheese quesadilla. It was nothing special but still good. My girlfriend ordered their \"Award Winning\" Barbecue Tacos. She said they were a perfect 10 out of 10 and that the pickled onions made it. However the rice was a tad bland. Her cousin ordered steak and shrimp fajitas and said they were good but a little too complicated. Like a little too much spice maybe. But he still ate the whole thing.       The service was fantastic. Everyone looked like they either liked being there or were pretty good a faking it. All the hostesses and waiters/waitresses looked pretty young, but they were doing a great job. Our chips and waters were constantly being refilled. Our waitress was great, but no one there wore name tags, so I can't directly commend her.       Overall, it was a very nice dinner. No big problems, atmosphere was great, food was good. I would recommend this to people and wouldn't mind going back next time we come over here!",

    "text": "I love this place!  I can't believe it took me this long to try this joint out, I don't know what is wrong with me!  Ambience: It's located in the beautiful Borgata - well, its beautiful for now, who know once the Condos come in - with two patios: a larger one in front, facing Scottsdale Road (but far enough back that its relaxing) with two awesome fire pits and a smaller patio section on the side. The wall that separates the front patio from the inside of the restaurant is constructed of windows that are able to be raised (like a garage door) to allow an open feel. Today, however, the windows were down since it was a little chilly and despite having heaters on the patio, we decided to sit inside, but next to the window so we could stare at the fire pit. The inside decor reminds me of a Southern beach home with the crisp white ceiling with exposed painted beams and the pops of color with bar stools and tables, which is really fun, but also relaxing. There are two TV's that face each other which limits their viewing to only one side of the restaurant and I also noticed a small, unoccupied DJ booth. We came here for lunch and although there was not a DJ the music was loud and the genre being played is something you might find at a dance club.  The food: We started with the Cheese and Guacamole Cheese Crisp ($9) and two iced teas. While we were waiting for our app and deciding on what we wanted for lunch, we were brought chips and salsa. The salsa wasn't anything special, but the chips were of higher quality than other Mexican restaurants. Also of higher quality was our cheese crisp. I still can't believe how enjoyable it was and I think its because of the mix of cheeses they use (Oaxaca, Asadero and Monterey).  I don't know it, but its definitely an app that should be tried! For our entrees we both went with the tacos, one order of grilled fish ($13.5) and an order of their award winning (the award came from the Taco Festival per the server) slow cooked BBQ pork ($11). Both entrees came with their rice which has corn mixed in and your choice of black or charro beans (pinto beans with bacon). We both enjoyed our entrees which each came with three, palm-sized tacos and we couldn't make any criticism regarding the food or the service. We had a great time.  I took off a star because of the higher prices, I know its supposed to be \"upscale\" mexican, but $9 for a cheese crisp is pretty step no matter how delicious it is. Regardless, I will be back!",

We all ordered Tacos besides the chips, salsa, queso & Guacamole.  When the food came I could tell already that the plates must have stood a while in the open because the beans had this slightly dried layer on top like when it is exposed a long time to the open air.  Rice and beans were cold and the quality of the Tacos was mediocre.  We have been to Blanco a lot of times before but never experienced such low quality.  We mentioned the cold rice and beans and the waitress brought us  some warm rice & beans  later  after we were getting close to almost being done eating.  Since leaving the restaurant I had to run twice already to the toilet  I think this was my last time at Blanco.  It is not what it used to be.",

They had corn relish, picked onions and cilantro cream. They were small but pretty well packed with meat. They left us wanting more. My husband thinks they were hipster priced and sized lol Some of my pulled pork pieces were a little burnt/charred, but overall it was pretty good. Not sure about award winning, they didn't blow my mind. Our server kind of forgot about us at the end. Overall it was a slightly better than average dining experience.",

Blanco happened to be just down the street from our resort so we decided to check it out for dinner.   Glad I read up on some reviews and signed up in time for $10 off email. With most of the entrees priced in mid teens, $10 off was a generous offer.   I debated for a while if I should balance my ginormous burger diet (earlier lunch) with some greens. But after learning Blanco was famous for their skillet enchiladas - I caved and ordered their chicken while my husband opted for their short ribs.   Both their enchiladas were beyond delicious. There was actually very little tortilla - just a thin layer on top, stuffed mainly of proteins and cheese. Actually reminded us more of a lasagna. Loved that they cooked it in a skillet because it kept the cheese bubbly, warm, and gooey. Not the most waistline friendly meal but no regrets!   Overall - def worth checking out when in Az!",

All Fox restaurants are good, you won't be disappointed eating here either. The ambiance is excellent, service is good, and crowd is always fun. Definitely sit on the patio when you go to Blanco to get the True AZ resort feel. My go to meal is the stacked chicken enchiladas, they have good flavor but be sure to get sour cream. This last visit I ordered the short rib enchiladas and queso dip for an appetizer. I did not like the rib enchiladas as much as the chicken, they were somewhat bland but very rich. It was a missed opportunity that a little salt and garlic could have dramatically improved. I will come back and have eaten here at least 20 times.",

Management recently made numerous changes, including changes to their menu and ingredients, and I believe that this has had an impact on the quality of the food overall. The salsa is not as good (used to be delicious), the chips are always over salted, and I swear the margarita glasses/servings get smaller every time I go. Also, they got rid of the blood orange margarita on the menu, which used to be the favorite of everyone I know. While the food is still decent, it does not measure up to the high meal and drink prices. I'm sad about their recent changes, and won't be visiting as frequently any more.",

The atmosphere is good like you would expect in Arizona with outdoor space that is occupied  The food is acceptable but not at all exceptional. There are no real hot sauces and the waitress informed us that they were all mild. So we added jalapenos to everything.  My 3 Chicken tacos were ok but very small with little meat. Basically we paid upscale prices for street tacos. My wife's burrito bowl was mostly rice and beans.  The service was mediocre.  I ordered the tortilla soup as a starter and the waitress asked if I wanted it separate or together with the meal.  We clearly ordered it as a starter and separate. It came all together though....I asked the new server to please return it as we addressed in the very beginning. When they brought out the main course it was cold so they made no attempt to keep it warmed and just placed it out of the way.  Water came plentifully but when we ordered additional salsa it took quite some time.",

Guacamole, chips and salsa- when the waiter knew I was dairy free, he asked if we would like the guacamole to be dairy free as well! I was very impressed. It tasted great! The chips and salsa are some of my favorites! So good!! Variety of tacos - the guys got several different types of tacos. Pork, barbecue, shrimp!! They loved them all!!  The rice and beans that come with the taco meal's were so good as well!!!!  Our server was on top of everything! Drinks were never empty, plates were taken away promptly! Manager even stop by to make sure that we were doing good! Hands-down one of my favorite Mexican places to go ever! Can't say it enough",

I have never seen such an involved, caring owner/manager as Nate and I truly admire that. All business owner's should aspire to be like this. My voice was heard, understood, and action is taking place so I am looking forward to coming back to this location for a new experience!   INITIAL REVIEW: Ok dine-in service and terrible takeout service (forget it). I say this not because things are slow-moving, but because the people they have working at this location have bad attitudes and don't treat you well unless you're buying a drink and they see a big tip opportunity for themselves. It's a big shame too because the food really is so great.",

Went here to wind down on Sunday night shenanigans with my girls, grab a few drinks and some food. It wasn't too busy around 7pm, and we got seated right away. Our waitress came over and introduced herself, and asked our drink order. We didn't know which margarita we wanted right away, however our waitress recommended a few, and we made our choices. We also ordered water, because let's face it -- we live in AZ. We were all chatting and getting caught up in our conversation, but we did notice that our margaritas made it over to our table before our water... a bit out of the ordinary. Then we had to ask for water again before it was brought over -- maybe she forgot?   We didn't order much since we wanted to get together more than anything; I definitely wasn't impressed with the service though. The food was okay... we got some chips and salsa, and ordered some guacamole to go along with it. We also got two Mexican chopped salads that were pretty good. The service was fairly slow overall, and not very on-point. Not sure if we went on an \"off\" night?  I might stop by Blanco again, perhaps for a drink at the bar, but not quite sure I'd do dinner there again. Sorry.",

We came in well after lunch but before dinner - 'Linner.\" I got the fish tacos ($13) and my husband got a cheese enchilada ($10). I was served three tortillas no more than 3 inches in diameter with bits of chopped stuff and one piece of fish the size of my thumb in each. I'm a small person, so this was okay, but the fish was almost inedible. Awful stuff. My husband's enchilada was in a small iron skillet and had a sugary sauce. Disappointing. I couldn't get a regular iced tea either - they only had passion fruit and green hibiscus. I got a pomegranite/grapefruit margarita which was pretty good, but pretty light overall. If you were looking to party, you'd have to down several of these $9 concoctions to really feel it. Total bill, with tip, for this affair was just under $40.  Skip it if you're looking for a nice meal. If you're looking to hang out with friends, munch on some appetizers and drink, then it's sorta kinda okay.",

    "text": "Where to start?  There were approximately 20 of us in our group, and we had called earlier in the week to make a reservation - since we knew it was a special occasion, a friends birthday, and we knew when, where, and approximately how many people would be there.    When we got there, they had given our tablyone sat down.  One of my friends was separated from the peoplee to an earlier birthday party who \"still hadn't left yet\"... and, by the looks of it, weren't planning on leaving any time soon.  Good for them, I wouldn't want them to rush, but the establishment should have planned a little better or figured that birthday parties/large groups would take longer.  That was frustrating, but they eventually sat us...  However, when we get to the table... the \"table\" is 4 spots too short... and the waiters are obviously irritated we are there.  Those of us that could, plopped down in a seat to get out of the way of the waiters... well, little did we know that was our \"seat\" for the rest of the night and we weren't to move.  They brought us another table or two to add on and ever in the group she knew - so everyone moved down so she could sit by people she knew.  This was while everyone was getting situated, drink orders were just being started, and WAY before we ordered food... however, one of the waiters decided to be a total prick about it and cause a scene about us \"moving\".  Well... if you would have counted how many guests there were and set up the table in the first place, we wouldn't be moving... you rushed us to get seated so we were out of your way - now you should just DEAL with one person moving.  Not to mention, making a scene made all of us uncomfortable.  I looked over the menu nothing looked particularly appealing (in fact, the menu is SOOOO unoriginal) - so I asked the waiter two questions - 1st, what the most popular dishes are, and 2nd, what he would order.  I took his suggestion and ordered the Combination Fajitas = Big mistake.  My steak was charred to the point where the \"char taste\" is all I could taste.  The shrimp was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The skillet that the meat came on was hot, but there was so much liquid on it that it didn't sizzle and the meat was luke warm (at best).  It came with white rice (yuck)...and black beans.  The black beans were the best part of this whole dish...and the sad part, is that they were just regular old black beans with a little cheese on top.  After I had tried to choke down 1 fajita, I decided I was done with the dish.  After everyone was done eating, the waiter came and asked me if I wanted a box.  He never asked me how my food was, how everything was tasting, if he could get me anything during my meal... just could he get me a box?!?!  Why would I want a box for burnt steak and cold shrimp??????  Not to mention, after I finished my greyhound, I ordered an ice tea - and after finishing my first (and only) ice tea - he never asked me if I wanted more or came around with another Tea - in fact, I couldn't get his attention to even ask for another ice tea!!!    I spent over 45.00 on a meal and a couple of drinks and I received about 1.00 worth of service and mediocre (at best) food.  With all the good options and unique restaurants in the valley - it's safe to say this place is crossed off of my \"list\" as far as places I will eat again.",

They serve it smothered in a lot of cheese and beef...it's served with this creamy/spicy/cheesy sauce that I have no idea what it is, but it's damn good.  Also, the chips on the nachos and the chips from the chips and salsa they serve when you're seated  are always crisp and stay crisp throughout the meal...pretty good.  I had the fish tacos the first time I was here and had the shrimp tacos the last time.  The fish was okay and the shrimp really didn't have much flavor.  They use a lot of sauces with the tacos...kinda like spicy sour creams.  The sauces taste good, but they drown out the other tastes in the dish.  If it weren't for the nachos I would probably give this place two stars.",

    "text": "Cool atmosphere but my friends and I were a bit disappointed with the food.  Before I complain though, I will say that the chips and guacamole were excellent.  Their chips are the thick, greasy kind that always tastes so good.  The guacamole \"Blanco style\" has cojita cheese in it and really was delicious!    I had the Blanco Chopped Salad (achiote chicken, seasonal fruits, and pepitas) and found it pretty bland and boring.  (The achiote chicken salad at zTejas is much better.)  Others at the table had the cheese crisp with chicken and the green chile pork enchilada with chicken.  The cheese crisp was huge but nothing too exciting -- all the cheese and chicken seemed to be crammed into the middle, so the end pieces were mostly plain tortilla.  The enchilada with chicken was kinda weird -- it had this weird chewy pulled chicken.  We honestly couldn't even figure out if it was chicken or pork.    The service was okay but it seemed like we constantly needed more water.  The glasses were too small and were filled with ice.  I'd probably come back here just for some chips, guac, and a drink.",

Tasted more like fruit punch than wine. Glad I had a sample before I ordered. 4. Happy Hour-- appetizers (including cheese crisps!) are 1/2 off.  Service 1. Wait staff appears to be very inexperienced.  After ordering, my server said, \"there has been an accident in the kitchen.  Someone cut their finger\".  I was expecting to be told my Blanco cheese crisp was going to have a special red sauce, but then he continued, \"I have to take him to the hospital, so Buddy will take care of you\".  Atmosphere 1. Nice open restaurant with awesome patio.  Great for the cooler weather, built in heaters throughout. 2. HUGE bar in the center of the restaurant, great for those creepy old Scottsdale guys who like to check out the chicks.  Misc 1. Their plates are so heavy, they can be used for either Frisbee Golf or as a weapon. 2.  I have never seen so many trendy gay men in my life (they were either gay or severly metro sexual)",

This was a shame, as my cohorts were sloshin' it up and the proprietor could have generated some serious revenue on those margs if someone was willing to serve them!   I had the shrimp tacos which weren't nearly as good as the shrimp/ancho tacos at Jasper's Bistro, but still quite tasty and served hot.  Chips & salsa are great, too.    All in all, only the service brought us down.  It's never fun to have to ask for something twice, right?

    "text": "So I gave the Blanco in Tucson a less than favorable review, yet at the same time I couldn't wait for this one to open. Sure, I miss Taneko Tavern, and all of its sake covered glory. At the same time Fox RC always opens up clean, safe-bet, fun restaurants and Blanco is no exception.  The restaurant is brightly colored, with loud lounge like music, and an overall buzzy feeling atmosphere, even if the uniforms make me feel like I am at a frat house. I wouldn't come here looking for innovative Mexican cuisine, because Blanco serves a very American style of cuisine, but with tortillas. They have an obvious American atmosphere, that makes me immediately think of the spa crowd coming here before or after their treatments or in between shopping stops. You'll also see a lot of older folks that come from Paradise Valley around lunchtime or for mid-day drinks. Hey, if you don't have to work, then why not drink your day away on $12 margaritas, right?  The salsa is a sweet, almost candy like substance that goes very well with their grease puff tortilla chips that are glistening-golden brown. Their menu features 8-10 different tacos, all available on either soft white corn tortillas, or yellow corn fried shells. My favorites are the steak and ahi tuna, both full of flavor ($12) and plentiful for a meal that doesn't make you feel like you overate. They also have several entrees which feature steak, seafood, and chicken between $14 and $22 which I have only sampled a couple, both very satisfying.   I've never gone into Blanco craving Mexican food, expecting Mexican food, or telling my guests they are going to get Mexican food. It's always been well received by those who I have brought here, and always a fun place to be for a couple of drinks on a busy Friday night. Seriously, the name is Blanco, Spanish for white. Shouldn't that be a dead give away this is American food?",

I had the tacos; the mushroom tacos tasted more like spicy salsa tacos and the fish tacos were just bland.   One thing Blanco did well was dessert. The tres leches was awesome.

I am guessing management reads Yelp reviews, because I've made several trips to Blanco's over the Summer and can say that staff attentiveness is way up!  They were quick to take my order, bring the salsa and chips, and keep an eye on drink refills - all without being too overbearing.  It is once again a good place to hang out without having to worry about whether you'll get good service.  They could probably double the size of the bar and still keep the crowd from looking thin, but that's another issue..",

It get great having the feeling of ordering off of a full menu, not just having one or two options. The chips, salsa, guacamole, queso, and the enchilada were to die for. When I'm back in Scottsdale I will definitely be coming back. Service was great. Food was great. And the experience was great.",

The crab and shrimp ceviche was the most disappointing though. It looked so fresh. However tasting the crab; something seemed off. When we asked the waitress she said \"oh yeah it's imitation crab\". Wtf so disgusting.  The only thing going for this place for us were the chips,  salsa and decent guacamole. Otherwise nothing great.  Really quite disappointed.

The staff is friendly and on their A game. Our waitress suggested a few things we tried, all of which were delicious!   Chips and salsa are brought to your table. The salsa has the perfect amount of a kick to enjoy while conversing and waiting for your order.   We started with the machaca and avocado cheese crisp, delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. The portion is that of a large tortilla. We didn't finish it so we could have room for our dinner. Hindsight, we could have ordered this and split it and it would have worked perfectly.  I ordered tacos. It doesn't say it on the menu but our waitress told us you can mix and match if you would would like to have different kinds and not three of the same. Which is exactly what I ended up doing. Carne Asada, was wonderful and probably my favorite. BBQ slow roasted pork, if you like BBQ sauce you'll like this. I wasn't expecting the sauce and it came off far to sweet for me. However, with the roasted corn, pickled red onion, red jalapeno... The flavors and textured combined are really good, just not what I expected. The third I ordered was the Machaca because of how much I enjoyed it on our starter.   The red sangria was a bit tart and my spouses classic margarita tasted like a glass of mixer with no tequila. (both of them)  All in all a very good dining experience. If we fly here again we would come back.",

This is not an amazing dining experience and the food isn't anything special, but it's a relaxing restaurant. The service is pretty bad. Super young wait staff that look good but are slow and sometimes rude.   I've eaten here 4-6 times and I always get the guacamole to start and the kobe beef burrito. The burrito is huge and I always have leftovers. One great thing about Blanco is the rice -- it's an odd side since it's pretty buttery but I think it's yummy.   The chips and salsa are standard and I've often had stale chips. Also, the Pepsi is usually flat.  In sum: the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to, however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience.  Go here and try it -- just know it's a gamble.",

    "text": "It seems like the more Fox restaurants I visit the more I realize that the food is just second fiddle in their quest for hipness.  And since I'm not a hipster doofus a lot of their effort rings hollow.    The location is cool and patio allows you to enjoy the unique Spanish influenced architecture of the Borgata.  The decor, like all Fox restaurants, is hip and well executed.  The ambiance is perfect for the happy hour crowd.  Unfortunately I typically don't number myself with that group.  The music was too loud and stiffed any attempts to enjoy the wider ambiance.  A highlight were the chips.  They were dense and very close to those that I enjoyed while I lived in the Mexico.  We tried a number of dishes and they were all perfectly above average.  The cheese crisp was good but only warm and not worth the $10.  The carne asada tacos were good, positive nod to the creamed rice, but the price once again wasn't truly justified.  The salmon was tasty and well presented with the spinach, corn, and squash.  It was very nicely cooked but a tad fishy in taste.  We wrapped up the meal with the tres leches cake and, like everything else, it was good but not especially memorable.  So in summary, Fox restaurants- Blanco included- are good places to be seen but not necessarily the best places for distinctive and memorable food.  The food is good but I doubt its the real reason why so many people frequent them.",

Now being avid Fox concept customers good service is expected, shortly after being seated our server Kareem came by and his initial attitude was awesome, we could tell he was slammed busy with many tables and lots of guests yet he never once failed to pay attention to detail to us or any other guest. Even the table behind us with five or six guests was joking with him and as he walked away one patron even pumped his fists laughing saying to his friends \"Man! I love this guy!\" Kareem was excellent and the service provide and his amazing attitude towards the night, to my family, and all his other guests was well worthy of my review and time to write it!

Once they seated us we found out they thought we were 3 people. Not sure how that happened and if that made us wait longer.  I had the grilled salmon. The salmon itself was alright, but I was disappointed to find out their \"roasted yukon hash\" contained bacon. That would be really shitty for people who can't eat pork. The Chayote and sweet peppers were also part of the hash, which I was not expecting. I thought I'd get some hearty cubes of chayote and a bed of spinach. Hardly any vegetables here.  Also the water tasted like bleach. What's up with that?",

Our server was attentive and was quick in taking out orders and checking in with us  every few mins. I had the Cheese and Guacamole Crisps which were to die for. It's like an open quesadilla over a crisp tortilla very different and delicious. My bf had Enchiladas. Now they were not your normal enchiladas. They were served in a bowl with the tortilla in the bottom, filling over it and then covered with a layer of cheese with rice and beans on the side. We've been to many Mexican restaurants, but this was an interesting concept that we enjoyed. The ambiance is amazing. Perfect for a date night or family dinner. There's outside seating where you can sit around the fire. There's also a fully stocked bar in the middle which is very pretty and tvs around to watch teh game. Overall a great experience and would definitely go there again.",

The first thing I notice about Blanco is that every single time, we have good service. I definitley can't say this for some of the other Fox restaurants, but Blanco's staff does great everytime. Hostesses don't act snooty, servers are attentive and friendly, and even the bartenders are very nice. We have often been sat at tables near the bar, and the bartender has offered to refill drinks if our server wasn't around. The food is also amazing. I don't have super high standards for Mexican food, so I'm happy with the quality handmade guacamole and other regular menu item staples. I LOVE the happy hour at Blanco. Half off all appetizers and drinks. You can easily make a meal sharing appetizers, we usually get the guac, the steak quesadilla, and the chicken taquitos. All the margaritas I've tried have been good, but their blood orange marg is one of my favorites out of any mexican place. Would highly recommend. The food never disappoints and servers seem to actually care that you are enjoying yourselves.",

    "text": "Went here very late Friday night after picking up a friend from the airport in town from SF. We sat on the patio, but I noticed the interior was v. cool and the bar was massive. Although we were here for late dinner, I can't wait to go back for happy hour sometime. The margaritas were incredible - I tried the blood orange and my friend had some kind of pomegranate-something-something. They were both fantastic, and the tequila list was strong which is a big plus in my book. The drink list was refreshingly innovative and unique. Even the chips and salsa are worthy of mention. It's been a while since I've had guac near as tasty as at Blanco. We both had different varieties of tacos which I thought were outstanding. I usually consider the accompanying rice and beans as filler which I almost always pass over to save room for more booze, but not this time. The only complaint I had was the patio seating wasn't very good for eating - great for drinks and socializing, but we were posed in a constant hunch the entire time as we sucked down our food.  The patio seating does have couches and comfy chairs which are perfect for the happy hour setting. The place also seems to attract a fun, vibrant crowd. It probably goes without saying, as I'm certain I'm the only r'tard who would choose to eat outdoors in Scottsdale right now, but definitely eat at the bar or the in the dining room.",

Bland and tasteless pureed salsa.  Asked for other salsas.  One was tomatillo and it was spicy but still bland somehow.  Other red one was just a bland.  Had cheese crisp.  It was alright.  Side of beans.  They were just alright.  Companion had carnitas.  VERY BLAND.  Rice was bland.  Service was slow and just alright.  Noticed a huge selection of tequila.  Didn't drink that night.  Did have fresh squeezed oj.  Pretty good.  Glad to have option of fresh squeezed.  Offer grapefruit too.  Looked like an interesting foo-foo drink menu.  Nice ambiance.  Music was annoying jazzy music that went on and on.  No variety.  Overall, the food is so boring and tasteless.  Reminds me of Maria Maria.  Not authentic Mexican food.  Made us think that this place is for snowbirds from midwest who don't know any better and aren't used to spicy or authentic.  They would probably love it.  Price is too much for the boring food.  Thought it was going to be good as you can see the chefs cooking while we waited to be seated.",

I am so tired of poorly executed places that charge a premium (for the category) and deliver poorly.  This place is really awful.  It tries to be trendy with the wait-team dressed in striped blue knit shirts that look like they have been washed a few too many times.  The food is fair to poor, presented in a heaped plating style that was not appetizing.  I had a salmon entree and my friend a chicken dish.  Neither was really special in any way.  Chips are good, salsa is not. Drinks are way overpriced.  The  \"house\" 'Rita was $8 and was small, really too sweet and totally unforgettable. There are many, many better places out there.  This one has a bunch of Scottsdale, tired wannabes as patrons (I agree with Jenny R.!), and an untrained staff.  Our waitperson was OK in the beginning, but she disappeared at the end.  Our final drink was served 10 minutes after we finished our meal, at least 15 minutes after we ordered it!  We almost called 911 to file a \"missing waitperson\" report.  Instead, $75.00 later (for three drinks and two entrees, tax and tip), we left and we will not be back.",

Pieces of avocado on the nachos,yum, and great cheese and beans along with other toppings. Best nachos I've ever tasted. I ordered the cheese enchiladas. They weren't the best enchiladas I have ever had but they satisfied my craving for Mexican cuisine. The price was decent. About $9 -$12 per entree. Considering you are eating in downtown Scottsdale in a very upscale neighborhood-I was impressed. The atmosphere was very casual and hip. I think this is a great place to go hang out with friends. Loved the brown and blue motif. The service was bland. Our waiter did his job but didnt blow us out of the water. I think nowadays with the economy the way it is you have to take it up a notch on service. I have gotten the same kind of service at my neighborhood Taco Bell.  The manager at Blanco's should take notes on Fogo's wait staff which is superb.  Basically would recommend this place and would go back for those nachos!",

I would have liked to see some sauce on them or something.  The rice served with it wasn't even Spanish rice, and wtf is up shredded carrots as a side.  Blah!  The highlight of the evening was definitely the white peach margarita - OUTSTANDING and one of the best drinks I've ever had.  However, seemed a little light on the tequila.  After chugging 2 of them on an empty stomach, I would have expected Mr. Buzz to pay me a nice visit.  Instead, I got his niece.",

Here's the issue:  I ordered a Kobe Steak Burrito with NO Pico De Gallo and then reiterated....NO onion, NO tomato, NO Pico.  Waiter asked how I would like it cooked. \" Well Done please\" (being I actually had E Coli about 12 years ago and was hospitalized).   Food comes in a timely manner.  I cut my burrito in half and take a bite. Literally \"raw\".  Im not a BBQ master...so I asked around.  We decided that is was extremely Rare and the opposite of Well Done.  Waiter came and he was upset with the kitchen as he should be. Roughly 5 minutes go by and a lady with dark longer curly hair (I assume a manger) brings another burrito.  Cut it open to investigate....meat is Well Done.... but it is full of Pico and Tomato and Onion.  Same guy waiter takes it back and we asked to not have the cooks spit in are third shot. Ha ha...though we were serious.  Third burrito comes and it is as ordered.  WE THEN GET THE CHECK AND THE BURRITO IS NOT COMP'd NOR DID THEY OFFER A COMP'd BEER, APPETIZER OR GIFT CERT FOR \"Next Time\".  There is no next time.   ....Hmmmmm.  I like Yelp.",

    "text": "I've been a customer of Blanco's for quite a while now. It's a go-to place for girl's night or a quick bite with my hubby. Unfortunately, Blanco has lost both my husband and I as patrons.  On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect.   An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right.   I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now. Thanks for the help, Blanco!",

I had the cucumber and kumquat margarita with shrimp tacos.  The margarita was far better than the tacos - they were just normal shrimp tacos.

We were still technically in our bathing suits and as the sun set I felt extremely under dressed for a Saturday night.  Don't mind me, my ass is only wet because I was at the pool all day... I swear I didn't pee my pants.   We sat at one of those communal tables, which I always enjoy.  Some nosey old lady kept grilling my friends on things like iphones and tattoos.  It was entertaining.   The service was great and the manager even got us a seat way before the quoted 30 minute wait.    I had the short-rib enchiladas and highly enjoyed them.  They tasted a lot like the enchiladas my ex's mom used to make.  So, it's nice that I no longer have to date him just for his mother's delicious Mexican meals.  The rice is also pretty good, but a little different- it's creamy and corn adds a hint of sweetness that I really enjoy, even though it can be a bit salty for my taste.    I won't hate on Fox restaurants just because it's a Fox restaurant.  I usually enjoy myself at all I've been to and if the food is just okay, well, at least there is plenty to look at.  Hell, I love Julio G's so you probably shouldn't listen to anything I say.",

I'm not sure why but halfway through lunch they opened the doors and left them open, flies started buzzing around our food and table.  Their food is typical Arizona Mexican food with bland flavor and no authenticity. If you are looking for a Mexican dining experience this isn't the place. We started off with guacamole, chips and salsa. The guacamole was tasteless and didn't have enough cilantro, onions or tomatoes it also didn't have any chopped serranos/jalapenos plus it needed salt. I ordered the carne asada tacos which had very dry corn tortillas, they had to be at least a few days old and left out uncovered. The meat was dry, a little chewy and lacked in flavor as well. The butter rice was good and the bean were good but lets be honest how can you mess those up.",

They bring it out in a mini cast iron pan and instead of rolled enchiladas it was like an enchilada pie and it was sooo amazing I dont even think I swallowed one bite I basically just inhaled it!  Only complaint is that they do NOT take reservations unless you have a party of 8 or more :( seriously?! so either get their early or go late if you want to get in and out. Otherwise expect a wait and have a drink or two at the bar while you wait",

Our main course items were put in front of wrong person. Salmon with vegetables was bad, veges were bitter. The dish was returned. We replaced it with Salmon salad. Which we canceled because of delay , but, it was charged to my bill , even after the manager took it off personally and i paid. We asked for 1 glass of red wine, the server brought the bottle of wine. Then we requested 2 glasses of wine, we got 1 served without wine glasses. It was complete mess yesterday.  I give 2 stars because of our server. They don't take reservations. May be that is why kitchen and floor staff are confused and get over loaded.",

I had the chips as an appetizer with salsa, mildly spiced, and delicious queso, also quite mild. The guacamole was good- although I do prefer to have it a little spicier. For my main course I had the beef enchiladas with braised short rib. It came out with an authentic Mexican presentation in a hot skillet. I had it with a side of their rice and street corn. Wow that stuff is seriously addicting. I only ate half of everything because I was beyond full. The sangria wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely added a nice touch to the meal. Can't wait to go back and try more....after I finish these leftovers!",

I havent made a meal in my kitchen for years and depend upon the good restauranteurs of Phoenix for sustanence. Sadly these two places mentioned herein are  now off the rotation list of places to eat.  WE have watched the corporate cutbacks on food quality gradually decline into unacceptable levels. September 23rd , I ordered fish tacos with a side of guacomole. What I got was three miniscule 3 inch tortillas each containing a very small,  less than bite size piece of fish.  I have seen these small tortillas at other eateries served as appetizers in portions of three just like this offering. The fish tacos were about 15 bucks! The side of guacomole was 9 bucks!  Even if the food was excellent  (which it was far from) the portion size was pathetic .  Just a bad deal all way around.  Locals avoid it now and apparently the locale next to several hotels may keep it going. Unsuspecting tourists be warned.  AVOID this one.",

I love Mexican food and Blanco has taken it to another level. They have a large menu with enough selection and diversity to satisfy anyone. My favorite item on the menu are the Ahi Tuna tacos, they are simply spectacular. Nothing better than a few tacos and a corona after a long day of work. My only issue with this restaurant is the service. For some reason the staff is less attentive here than at other Fox Restaurants. I've been here 5 of 6 times and the service is always so-so.

They also have a pretty wide selection of bottled Mexican beers.  Its nice not have to settle for Corona.  Some people don't like the interior, but I like the clean, all-white look.  Its kind of a refreshing & calming look for a restaurant that wants you to relax.  Food is pretty filling & tasty.  Had the seared Ahi tacos, and they were filled with big tuna chunks.  Buddy had enchilads (he is from Tennessee), and he really liked them.  That in itself should be a win for a Mexican joint.  There's a lot of tequila here to try, but it can get pricey.  If the weather was nicer, I would have sat on the patio.",

    "text": "My first visit to Blanco was one that I will remember for awhile. I'll begin by saying that the food was good. I had the machaca beef tacos and a margarita. The beef was very flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick to it, and the margarita (I had the frozen variety) was decent too. That being said, it was rather pricey ($11) for two tacos, rice and beans. I've had better for a LOT less.  Now, I must shift my review from food to the atmosphere. I've got a story to tell, but please note that this story in no way reflects the quality of the restaurant or my feelings about returning. I just want to share the hilarity of my evening and to give you an entertaining reason to visit Blanco.  We all have preconceived notions about Scottsdale. I tend to stereotype the people that live and play in this part of town as snobby, snotty, stuck-up, and whatever other \"s\" word you can think of. Of course not everyone that lives or frequents Scottsdale is like that. However, the night my friend and I visited Blanco, that stereotypical Scottsdale crowd was in full effect.   I'm not sure if Blanco has a dress code for women, but it seemed like this Saturday night it was a requirement to wear as short a skirt or dress as possible, along with crazy high heels.  Oh, and it appeared there was a height and weight limit too -- nothing over 100 but taller than 6'. Maybe there was a model convention in town or something.  I have nothing against looking hot. In fact, I think I hold my own. I just was amazed at the amount of skin that was exposed in one restaurant. Being from the rather less cool NoPho area(and even less cool because I used that dumb abbreviation), I guess I didn't get the memo that this was the required look now.  The eye candy was entertaining to say the least, but I digress.  There was even more fun-filled antics to come. My friend and I were seated next to the bar and about 1/3 of the way into our meal, three 40-something guys were seated behind us.  They were drunk and annoying. I had my back to them, but my ears were tuning in to their conversation, and I heard comments like, \"Oh, she's a six.\" \"Yeah, for sure, a six.\" \"Oh, does she have a snaggletooth?\" Then there were the expletives,  the redundant \"dudes\" and the constant references to going to Vegas. Oh, and did I mention that my friend, who was facing them, was in full view of their overtly ogling of every miniskirt, tight-jean wearing chick that walked past them.   But that wasn't all. No, the \"dudes\" weren't quite happy enough with their caveman-like behavior. After they finished their meal, the middle guy I like to call King Douche asked the bartender if he could have the chef come out. Oh, boy, I thought, this is going to be good. Out comes the chef, who seemed nervous and annoyed at the same time.  King Douche began to rave about the food in an inebriated and slightly incoherent rant. Although I couldn't hear everything King Douche was saying, I think he said something about the food being really good.... but... then went on to criticize almost everything he ate, telling the chef something about having too much of this ingredient here and not enough here, and that he has been a restaurant manager, and it's important to hear the good with the bad, and on an on.  The poor chef stood there kind of dumbstruck.  I honestly don't think he knew how to respond.  He kindly thanked them for eating there and suggested they come back again.   I'm so glad that I wasn't facing these schmucks because I wouldn't have been able to keep from expressing my disgust and amusement. Instead, I just laughed with my friend while cursing their insipid behavior.  In the end, and despite all the young wannabe glamor girls and midlife crisis greasy creeps, it was a memorable dinner at Blanco.  I will likely give the place another try. But next time I'll come prepared to watch the antics with a little popcorn and candy.",

    "text": "Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes. To the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot. Try again Sam Fox.",

Never the less, my client showed up 10 minutes late and we were seated 5 minutes later. It took our servers 5-10 minutes to greet us and order drinks. Our server was training someone that NIGHT. She suggested beef tacos and burrito and I LOVED IT TO DEATH!!! I almost LICKED my plate. drinks were GREAT!! The Chef sent me a few dishes to TRY and it was awesome. SERVICE wasn't the greatest but the FOOD made the difference. I need to get back there soon!!",

    "text": "Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place.   I have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count.   Service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore.   I dunno, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall.   next!",

    "text": "Went to dinner with a couple great friends this past Friday night. We read about Blanco in the 'Where, Scottsdale' magazine and in another random Scottsdale mag they have at the massive information booth at the spendy Fashion Square Mall (you can really get a shopping fix on there, but that's another review - with more stars too!). Shame on me, I should have used the Yelp app on my iPhone to read the reviews before we decided on that place because it was a pretty decent sized let down... I just mistakenly figured that any place that boasts 50 tequilas would have decent Mexican food.   I have it in me but I'm not going to get all Mexican food preachy on you all but let's be real. This place is more Mexican inspired than traditional fare.   Top line:  1) Red wine sangria was marginal at best  2) Guacamole bland (they don't ask for preference on spice and it isn't made table side) - chips were THICK! Salsa was Pace like - seemed like it was from a jar, not freshly made. 3) Ahi tacos were inedible with an ancho chile and pepper flavor that was overbearing to the point of a burnt taste - we actually didn't even eat three pieces of the tuna (each taco has maybe eight sushi sized slices of tuna on it). They were also a little rubber like, not the melt in your mouth grade tuna.  4) The signature dish of beef rib enchiladas was probably the biggest let down - like the guacamole, just plain and bland in flavor.  5) Not sure about the rice concoction, it was very creamy and buttery, almost Rice-A-Roni like. 6) Caramel flan was American style with a huge among of whip cream on top. Flan is one of my weaknesses and I only had two small bites... bla bla bla!!! Downright SAD!   Lastly, it was a noisy place with little ambiance.   The best thing about this place was the side of pintos (charro style) that came with the entrees and the chorizo & cheese crisp. Those alone wouldn't warrant a return trip. Sorry Blanco, our first encounter just didn't lead me to want to see you again... No hard feelings, really - staff was pleasant, valet was efficient, food was just not great amigo!",

With a big bar in the center of the room and plenty of flat screen TVs I can see how this would be a fun place at night or to watch a game. Service was very good.  However, the food could use some improvement. The tacos aren't nearly as tasty as those at Barrio Queen, Diego Pops, or Cien Agaves.   Still, Blanco might do better than all of those as FRC has the ability to place restaurants at shopping malls all over the country and most places don't have the type of competition for Mexican food that there is in Scottsdale.  Overall, Blanco was good, but not great.",

We came with my grandparents, one of whom is in a wheelchair, and it would have been nice is there was more accessible seating. We had to get her into a booth with us, which isn't difficult, but made the difference between a 4 and 5 star review. Accessibility is a huge deal! To be fair, I don't know if this was mentioned when we made the reservation, but the VAST majority of tables were not wheelchair accessible.  On to the food! The chips and salsa came out immediately, and the chips were good, but the salsa was a bit too mild/bland for my preferences. The guacamole was excellent, but came in a smaller dish than I would have expected. I ordered a spicy mango margarita, which was AMAZING. Seriously, everyone, drink this! The crispy shrimp tacos were fabulously perfect. Seriously, I would come back just for this dish. The rice it came with was a bit bland, but acceptable.",

I recommend the tacos, which is a good plate to share, there are different kinds that you can mix and match and come with to-DIE-for rice and beans. I get the slow cooked BBQ pork,  Blanco's says is \"award-winning\" and I 100% agree!  Sometimes service can be slow depending on how busy they are but overall, the service is great!",

I didn't want a full dinner, so I ate at the bar and really enjoyed their house margarita ($8.50) - you can really taste the fresh lime and it was a decent size. Definitely one of the better margaritas I've had. I also liked their house salsa - just a bit of heat, a great consistency and very fresh tasting.  To nibble on, I ordered queso fundido which I didn't really care for. They add chorizo, but the sausage really needed to be drained off as it left a TON of oil which was pretty gross. (Yes, I do realize the irony of someone who decided to eat melted cheese for dinner complaining about oil...) There were also way, way too many sweet peppers in there for me personally - those weren't listed on the menu BTW.  I also had a small guac and loved it - clearly fresh made, and full of big avocado chunks. I probably should have ordered this alone. Service was pleasant and the prices are reasonable. If you're looking for tasty Mexican in a nice atmosphere, Blanco is a good option.",

Their prices seem to rise every time I visit which pits some people off but the food is always quality which I can appreciate. Their queso is among the best I've ever had, definitely put it on your list when you come here!! All the tacos are good, I haven't had one I didn't like.

    "text": "Came on a Saturday night around 8pm and had to wait about 15-20 min. Our server was very attentive and checked in on our table multiple times throughout the dinner, refilling waters and asking if we needed anything. We ordered, and the food arrived relatively quickly.  We ordered the Nachos con Queso Blanco with Short Rib and honestly it was one of the best loaded Nachos my friends and I have ever had. Each layer of the nachos had cheese, meat, beans, everything very well mixed throughout the entire pile which is unlike the typical Nachos where there is stuff on top and just chips underneath. The cheese was so creamy and satisfying. The short rib was amazing as well, very tender and perfectly seasoned. I shared this with 2 other people and we were pretty full from this alone.  We each also ordered the tacos where you could mix and match for a total of 3 tacos per order. I ordered the crispy shrimp, slow cooked bar-b-q pork, and the carne asada. It came with rice and beans and a choice of flour or corn tortilla.  The shrimp taco tasted good but I may have not eaten it right away but it definitely wasn't crispy. I wouldn't say there was anything particularly special about it.  The slow cooked bar-b-pork was the \"award winning\" taco and the word that came to mind after eating it was \"interesting\". The meat was very tender and juicy and sweet but it was an interesting combination to put BBQ flavored meat in a taco. I guess it just wasn't what I expected but still good.  There wasn't anything special about the carne asada taco, it was a little bland to me actually so I took some of the short rib from the Nachos and added it to my taco and it was amazing.  My friend actually ordered the short rib taco and that was probably the best one.  The atmosphere was very trendy and hip like many places in Scottsdale. The servers also had an interesting uniform, very formal on top but casual on the bottom. A True semi-formal/semi-casual look.   Overall I think this place had amazing Nachos and short rib and I believe there are many other things that are great on their menu that we didn't get to try. Might come back and actually try their tequila drinks as well.",

We went in on a weekday during lunchtime and it looked slightly crowded. The hostess was super attentive and told us we'd only have to wait a few minutes (spoiler alert she was right)  Instantly greeted by a friendly waiter with a list of specials, and chips and salsa. I really, really liked the chips and salsa and that should mean a lot because normally that's not necessarily a memorable thing   My husband ordered the tiger shrimp fajitas and his plate was sizzling hot and hugeeee! The shrimp were giant and the veggies perfect! I ordered a cheese enchilada with black beans and rice and I loooved it! The enchiladas come sorta deconstructed- in a skillet. Therefore it was actually more food than a traditional enchilada would be!! BUT I could still eat like twelve *drool*  Beautiful, open, airy atmosphere. Loved the attentive service and the delicious Mexican food.",

So we are back in the saddle and today made me happy again.   Walked in the hostess was smiling and greeted us right away. We sat right away and was taken care of, she also said bye and thank you on the way out. She wasn't on her phone or worrying about cleaning menus or something other preoccupied task. She was focused on the customer.   We sit down within 30 seconds we have warm chips and salsa and greeted for drinks with specials. On point and good start. We order queso it comes up quickly and hot with constant extra chips. Our server was Josh if I'm not mistaken. Attentive and on his game and he even stirred up conversation.   What tipped it for me was the individual who brought out our meal which were the tacos for my buddy and I get my standard carne Asada and the beans on the side. Ok the guy who brought us the food didn't even ask who's food was what. He knew I had my burrito and my friend had the tacos. This is great. However the system for ordering and placing food in front of the right customer is mass ice attention to service. Love it.   The food was great. Queso and burrito were on it. The homemade salsa was money too. I've been to other Blanco Tacos and this was a good one to remember. Love it. #goodservice",

Margaritas were super watery with lots of ice and lacked in overall appeal. The portions were incredibly small with higher end prices. Atmosphere was nice and seemed family friendly.  Service was professional. We were checked on frequently and at first my boyfriend got the wrong order and I felt like they were quick to get him the correct one served.    From someone like myself, who has had a great variety of margaritas and Hispanic food I was unimpressed by the experience all together.",

It's Mother's Day so what the heck.   When we walked in it just didn't seem like a Mexican restaurant. It's a Fox Restaurant so it had the Fox vibe. If you know what I mean. Very open and airy. Modern yet casual with an open kitchen.   Our waitress greeted us quickly and got us started with our drinks. They started us off with their chips and salsa which was very good. Chips were fresh and crispy with a very good salsa. Not too spicy but really good.   We also ordered their Nachos Con Queso Blanco. It had fresh Avocado, sour cream black beans, and tomatoes. It was really good. Everything was very fresh. Just love the chips smothered with all these yummy toppings. So good and so big.   I had their Carne Asada Burrito and got it wet with their red sauce. So good. The meat was very tender and the red sauce just made it very moist. It was a very good Burrito. I tried on of my wife's Carne Asada tacos and it was on target too. Very good. Very fresh.   Our server was very friendly and really took good care of us. I know it was Mother's Day and they were really busy but she was always checking on our water glasses and making sure our food was okay. Really good service. The food out of the kitchen came out pretty quickly too.   So overall, this was a really good meal. Good food. Fresh food. Great service. It's one of those places we're you enjoy your company and food and the ambiance isn't distracting. Just good food and service.   Would I come back? Definitely. I don't say that to that many Mexican restaurant. So enjoy. We sure did.",

After I have filled myself up on chips and queso, I go for the tacos. Their award winning slow cooked BBQ tacos are my other go to favorites. They come with three street tacos, plus rice and a side of beans. You can order them with black or charro beans, or as I've recently found out, street corn!! Which is so tasty and only a little sweet. Its amazing! Their shrimp tacos are also noteworthy, as are their chicken nachos. :) Their chicken is never dry. Their beef cheese crisps are yummy and well, and giant. You'll wanna share these or have leftovers!",

I started with a classic and after realizing it was mediocre at best tried the blood orange- same deal. Then I ordered guacamole- which mind you says it's made with poblano peppers, caramelized onion, etc and basically was just a avocado and cojita cheese- I think they forgot the other ingredients. We also shared a fajita combo which honestly she should have been honest and said it was a lunch/ child size portion... flavor was good on the fajitas but when you feel you need to grab take out on your way home something is wrong. Will likely not be back  Update- \"manager Megan\" reached out to me personally and said she would send something to make up for the horrible visit. Well that was 2 months ago- never arrived smh",

We try at all costs to go to the Blanco at Biltmore and that restaurant is a night and day difference in the level of service you're provided.  We came into the Scottsdale location Saturday (yesterday) afternoon between 4:15 and 4:30 and the dining room was half full (if that) and we were told it'd be a 25 minute wait.  When you have a have a hungry toddler, that's a long wait especially when you see all of those open tables.  There's always a wait at this location no matter how slow they are and even when they're busy, you sit there waiting and watching dirty, empty tables sit for a long time before anybody tends to it, cleans it and gets it ready for the next customer.    The crappy part is that the food is amazing, it's just that the service stinks and doesn't live up to the Sam Fox standards.  Go to the Biltmore location and you'll never have to see a half empty dining room and have to wait and enjoy their great food.",

The girls at the hostess stand were less than inviting with a flip attitude letting us know it would be an hour wait and we got the feeling they could have cared less if we stayed. Next I waited at the bar for 15 minutes or more as the bar tenders continued to avoid eye contact. HELLO I'M trying to spend money here! I finally stood where your not supposed to, in the servers station and was waited on.  We did have a waitress who helped us get some chips and guacamole while waiting for our table and our waiter was great. Unfortunately the grilled fish tacos were dry and unappealing. We have been here many times and this was the second time in a row that disappointed us. Their are many choices in Scottsdale for a dinner out. We won't hurry back!",

Seating was catastrophic, had to wait 40mins when I could visibly see 10 tables open and set. This place was also like douche-bag central! Just reminds me of the Scottsdale Bars song!  If you wanna spend this much cash and get better food and drinks, go to the mission in old town Scottsdale!  On a good note however, once seated we did receive good service!",

    "text": "I came to Blanco last week for restaurant week. With a name like Blanco, I was expecting a white type of theme.  Here is my breakdown:  Atmosphere: Blanco was definitely a very modern themed \"New\" Mexican feel.  There was a good crowd there for happy hour and quite a few dinner guests coming in.    Drinks: We had margaritas and white sangrias.  I would recommend the pomegranate margarita.  You get some antioxidants, lol.  Food: Even before we get to the meal, the chips and salsa was amazing.  The chips were like Pita Style Chips and the salsa had a good kick, but not too spicy either.  We got the 2 for $30 restaurant week and 1 a la carte pork tacos.  We shared an appetizer of shrimp ceviche.  I usually like the halibut ceviche or white fish ceviche, but I was quite surprised how yummy this was with the tangy flavors I love in ceviche.  The 2 entrees were green chile pork enchilada and mahi mahi fish tacos.  I am usually not a big fan of pork, but it was flavored beautifully with the green chile.  The fish tacos were very light and flavorful.  The dessert was tres leche milk cake.  I was actually not expecting much out of the dessert since I was so happy and full from everything else.  THE DESSERT SEALED THE DEAL TO 5-STARS!  It had a creamy but light spongy feeling going down my tummy.  Service: The service also brought this rating up more.  We got great attention throughout our meal.  In the end, one of the guys who brings chips and salsa was taking my food away.  I mentioned I wanted a box.  I thought he was taking my food away to box.  A few minutes passed by, and I got the feeling her threw my food away.  I told the server what happened, and it looks like the chips guy didn't know English that well.  She brought out a brand new meal boxed up!!!  Overall, this was a great experience with great company!",

    "text": "No spice/heat to the salsa, including the \"hot\" one that the server said was an Habanero salsa.  This was an enormous disappointment because though I can understand making the standard salsa incredibly mild because of the general public, if they're going to make a designated hot one then it ought to have a decent level of heat.  Both were rather bland.  Also was disappointed that the flour tortillas are made with lard.    On the whole, I tend to like Mexican-themed restaurants like this one because they can be more modern and creative with Mexican style food, but usually that also goes along with more vegetarian options and decent spice levels for those who like the heat.  I'm already accustomed to having to deal with pork in the beans or chicken stock in the rice, but the lard in tortillas just isn't as common in the more modern focused Mexican places.  I felt like it was a bad mixture of authentic Mexican items with more modern traits.  Margaritas were pricey but in line with higher rent areas in Scottsdale.  Tequila list was surprisingly small for a place with this sort of name.  Service was very polite and prompt.",

    "text": "Ok, not Arizona Mexican restaurant ok, just Midwestern tourist Mexican ok.    Had a skinny margarita.  It was watery with no tequila flavor,  which is odd in Arizona. With so many great places to get a margarita the competition is high. I guess I'm spoiled.   Also tried the Corn appetizer (alote) and Questo dip. Both lacked depth of flavor and fell flat. The alote needed a bit more lime and some heat. We ended up mixing the corn and queso together which made it ok.  The salsa was tomato heavy with no flavor of chilis or cilantro. Again, sorry Fox, we're probably Arizona jaded and pretty Mexican food picky.   Our winter visitors from Wisconsin will love this place as it's not too \"hot\" and spicy.  For us, it was bland.  On a side note - the patio was a shock.  We anticipated more having tried other Fox restaurants.  The patio was filthy with tired old dirty cushions and uncomfortable furniture.  And the wait staff seemed almost angry or apathetic to customers.  We were celebrating a beautiful afternoon and never said a word other than smile and place orders but felt unwelcome.  Apparently others did too as we watched people quickly come and go.  We came for lunch but had an appetizer & drink then left for lunch somewhere else.",

We wanted to start off with a shot and she walked us through the different types of tequila and we had a shot of the Casamigos blanco and tasted the same line in reposado. You can definitely taste the difference and this would be a great spot to do some tasting.   We started off with the chips & salsa they brought out and added guacamole and the fresh seafood ceviche. All of which were okay. The guac wasn't anything extraordinary, I could have done with some heat and salt. The ceviche was sweeter than your typical fare and also super chunky, which I wasn't a fan of. I had a hard time deciding on an entree, but you can mix and match tacos so I tried the baja chicken, carne asada, and bbq pork tacos, all of which I enjoyed. I had a mix of the black and charro beans, and the rice was okay.   The star of the night was the white peach & hibiscus margarita which I would have drank by the gallon. It's very sweet so if that's not your style don't get it, but it tasted like sweet alcoholic candy :)  It's a cool spot, nice location, I'll be back.",

Inside is big and open with TV's that can be seen from every table.  Service has always been great, I've never found myself looking around for my server.

After about 15 minutes another hostess came over to ask us what we needed.  Meanwhile people are walking in and getting sat immediately.   Then we see a server pushing some tables together on the patio and setting up the table for 10 people.  Five more minutes go by and we were more than annoyed, so we decided to seat ourselves at that table.   Once we got seated, our server was friendly and attentive.  Average food, average drinks... I ordered a pomegranate and grapefruit margarita, the juice was supposed to be fresh squeezed, but I it tasted like pure sugar.   I ordered a taco salad with no meat and it was so drenched in dressing that I couldn't even eat the lettuce.   Two girls who ordered a different salad and actually sent theirs back for the same reason.   The other meals that came out to the table looked much better, so maybe I just made bad menu selections.",

The ingredients tasted fresh but it wasn't too spicy. I expect a little spicy when tacos and tequila are incorporated into the business name. Regardless, it was satisfying.  After we finished our little appetizer, we headed to the patio with fire where we originally wanted to sit. There was then room, so we sat to have a few more cocktails and finish the ones we had. Well, we were able to finish the ones we had. Nobody acknowledged us for the ten minutes we sat there. The patio is open seating so it wasn't like we skipped a step and didn' t have the host seat us.

The taquitos and chips and salsa were ok, but everything was sooo salty! I love salt, but I felt blah all night after eating my meal, wishing we had gone somewhere else. The best part of this place is the swanky vibe, you feel like you're eating at a nice resort in Mexico.",

And it sort of was, but the food had enough flavor that I enjoyed it. Prior to the meal, they brought out chips and salsa.  The salsa was pretty weak.  In about 2 minutes, my gf and I finished all of the salsa.  Our waiter walked by and noticed this and immediately asked if we wanted something a little bit spicier.  Of course we did.  He brought out a different type of salsa that was much better, much spicier. I ordered the fish tacos and there were very good.  Nothing much to say about that. Overall, I enjoyed the place.  Service was good.  Prices were fair.  When in the area again, I will go back.",

Blood orange margarita is off the chart. Quality of food for the money is really wonderful. started with a chorizo cheese crisp and loved it. then we shared some tacos, enchiladas and a burger. I would recommend everything we ate. the beef short rib enchiladas are to die for. Plus the vibe is really fun, patio is beautiful and comfy and ridiculous selection of incredible tequilas. Will be eating here often. great mexican food that doesnt leave you feeling like you just consumed a jar of lard. really nice clean fresh ingredients prepared with care. Love Love Love it!",

Their fajitas are amazing, their margaritas are always tasty and well poured, and the service is usually speedy and friendly.   One of my biggest pet peeves is walking up to the hostess and not being greeted. Tonight upon entering Blanco the two young girls hostessing merely stared at me when I approached, one was chomping on gum. When I realized they would not say so much as a hello, I said \"two please\" and was quickly ushered to a table. The gum chewing girl took away the silverware closest to her, disregarding the fact she set the menu on the place setting on which she took the silverware.   We had such a nice and attentive server. The food was tasty, as always. The apple pie Margarita was delicious and tasted just like apple pie!  When my friend and I got up to leave, the young lady who was chomping on the gum at the beginning of the night muttered a \"have a nice night\" without so much as a glance in our direction.   Perhaps I'm far too picky for a \"casual\" dining establishment, but when your servers are very friendly and the food is great but pricey ($75+ for a dinner for two), why have the first people guests encounter be undertrained and lacking in manners?",

If 2 of you are really hungry trying to split them, it may not be enough food. They also charge you a splitting/sharing fee they dont tell you about or put on the menu, so be ready for that. They dont give you cheese and you have to pay a dollar for a SMALL side of it. I'd go back but I'll definitely pay attention to what I'm paying for",

From the time we sat down to the time someone took our order was almost 35 minutes. Between that time no one asked about drinks or brought us water.  They finally took our order, it took 45 minutes to get our food which came out cold!   You'd think this place would have been slammed in order to receive such poor service, but know only half the tables were full. Stay away, mediocre food and less than pathetic service does not deserve a second chance.",

The salsa was filed with tangy tomatoes and chilies packing quit a bit of flavor.  Street corn was sweet and smart with a hint of cilantro.  The flavor raised my expectations for the rest of the meal.  Each entree was baked in its own skillet. Cheese enchiladas with ancho chili sauce was addictive I could not stop eating it. My fork kept digging in while my tummy said stop I can't eat anymore.  Service was fabulous and friendly.  Come one come all.",

The price part is True for the food you get. Yes you get 3 tacos but it's very minimal. The chipotle shrimp was very flavorful but the carne asada was a bit on the dry side.  We did get the calamari and that was not disappointing. We had leftover and normally not something I would take home but I did and ate it on the way home hahaa! I've always used lemon for my calamari and they gave us lime... which was actually a very refreshing addition.  The drinks in the picture were really good. The bar tender told us that all their recipes are fresh and organic. Our table was literally connected to the bar which was a great concept. It's not just bar seating but a table, face to face with your date. I enjoyed it.  I give this place a 4 star. The drinks were great and the appetizer was splendid but the main course could have been better especially for the price. I'm sure happy hour would make this place better but it was not happy hour when we went.",

I have a family full of foodies and trying new restaurants is always a part of our travel experience. Being that we live in Texas although we have our fill of tacos my family loves them so it was only natural that we stopped in. We walked in without a reservation and was seated at a table relatively quick. The waiter greeted us promptly, took our drink orders and brought us chips and salsa. He was very helpful suggesting drinks and menu items. I had the jalapeno and pineapple margarita and the carne asada tacos on corn tortillas. The drink had the right amount of kick. The carne asada tacos were flavorful. The meat was seasoned to perfection. The portion size was just right. If you're ever in the Scottsdale area I highly recommend this restaurant!",

The poblano pepper has just a little heat but it wasn't over powering.   My red chili chicken tacos were good, the acid in the pick de Gallo that tops the tacos was a perfect balance. The tacos are smaller, the flour ones were flavorful and didn't fall apart  My husband has been craving just normal crispy ground beef tacos and was so excited to see them on the menu. Ground beef was flavorful, taco shells perfectly crisp!   Chips and salsa were delicious, we added some salt to the chips but they were crispy and the salsa was flavorful.   Great experience, I can't say enough amazing things about the service. We will definitely be back!",

I'm from Houston, where Tex-Mex is the official comfort food of every resident who's ever lived there since 1962. Blanco Tacos reminds me a ton of many of the restaurants I visited with regularity during my formative years.  Much like my first visit, I went with the carne asada fajitas. A year earlier at a different location, I seem to remember the fajitas having a bit of an unusual cut and a slightly different flavor to them. It was different than what I was used to, but I was into it! This time around, the fajitas were very much in-line with what you'd find at the majority of these types of restaurants in Houston. And while I was kind of excited to try the Phoenix-version of fajitas again, the \"normal\" version of fajitas is *never* a bad thing. The only thing I would have changed is sour cream didn't come out with the meal, which should be a fajitas mainstay, IMO.  Oh, and we also ordered both types of queso and they both made me a happier person than I was before dinner. Chips and queso for president.   It's going to be hard to come to Phoenix in the future without a trip to Blanco Tacos!",

I literally drove here just for their nachos and since it was my first time I got to use their awesome $10 sign-up discount!   We got the nachos con queso blanco to share between the two of us and I got a glass of the white sangria. The nachos came out pretty fast, and we dug in right away. If you look at the pictures, the nachos definitely look really good and well-topped. The only thing that was a little annoying was that the toppings weren't really well balanced, so we found ourselves having to deconstruct the stack and spread the toppings over the inner chips that didn't have any toppings.   The other disappointing thing was that our nachos didn't come out with the crushed avocado, as it says on the menu. Our server was really great though and brought us a little bowl of crushed avo on the side when we pointed it out to him! I think if the avo had been on the nachos from the beginning and spread out, I would've enjoyed the nachos more.  Drinks wise, I'd recommend sticking to their margaritas instead of the sangria. There's a reason this place is known for tequila, not wine. I'm excited to come back here and try their margs on the awesome happy hour menu!  Overall, pretty solid place - good menu, good service, and great discounts/happy hour if you're looking for the most bang for your buck in Scottsdale.",

Taco Guild- absolutely the worst tacos I've ever had, The Mission Old Town- excellent food but not traditional Mexican food. And Sol Mexican Cocina- again not authentic Mexican food.  Lets fast forward to Blanco Tacos & Tequila, great atmosphere very lively crowd. My wife and I sat at the bar and trust me you'll have to come early to get a seat at the bar. The bartenders are great but they have the worst bar setup ever, please check the inside restaurant photos. One side of the bar regular seating the other side of the bar cafeteria style table seating, who came up with that idea.  Onto the food, I ordered the beef enchiladas which is served in a skillet, when the server came out with the food she stated that the skillet was very hot but yet my enchiladas were lukewarm. Beans and rice were the same, as far as authentic Mexican food let's just say I'm still searching.  This restaurant is deserving of two stars only, owner/management please do something about your bar setup and lukewarm food. Maybe try making the food when a customer orders, instead of hours before and then tossing it into a warming box when ordered. Remedy for the bar just put regular seating around the bar and do away with the cafeteria style tables.",

I typical get a mixture of side dishes and mix them together to make a \"naked\" burrito or burrito bowl. The beans are perfectly seasoned and really flavorful. Same with the rice. Their charred corn is always cooked well. I did get the carrots and jalepenos one time, and it was SO spicy that I couldn't eat it. I have a medium tolerance for spice.  I also enjoy the White Peach and Hibiscus Margarita. It has a great flavor.  My husband typically gets the Machaca Burrito made Enchilada style. It comes in a cast iron type individual casserole dish.   Service- The servers are really attentive and helpful, giving suggestions of menu items and accommodating special requests.  Decor- The design of the restaurant is really cool. Nice blues and whites, huge industrial type light fixtures. A nice patio and stocked bar in the middle of the main dining room.  In all fairness, we don't frequent Blanco, because you can get Mexican food that is just as good at a cheaper price point, but I do enjoy splurging on the ambiance of Blanco once in a while.",

On Valentine's Day, they wouldn't have staffed extra? Our server was ok but could she seemed new. We had the crab and shrimp ceviche and it was ok. It seemed fresh but I would have appreciated if it was diced more. Really hard to eat giant pieces of vegetables with chips and there wasn't a lot of shrimp in it either. We had the fish tacos and carne asado burrito. Both were ok but our food took a long time. Everybody kept saying food was on the way but still took time and my beans were cool when we got everything.  On the positive side, the ambience is nice, open and airy. The music was at a tolerable level when we came in but towards the end, the volume had been raised such that I couldn't hear my husband across the table.  Not sure if I will be back. I can think of other places I like better.",

This is definitely my favorite Fox Concept restaurant, with Zinburger being a close second. I love the tacos and blood orange margarita. We've had issues with this one bringing us shitty chips with some excuse as to why they don't have the good home made ones and then 10 minutes later the next basket we get comes with the good chips :| or great service until we need the check and then it is like pulling teeth. Stupid things to complain about... which is why they still get 4 stars. I'm giving the other Blanco 5 stars, you aren't as polished. Deal with it.",

We keep coming back because the wait staff is friendly.  So why only three stars.  On our last visit there was weird burnt stuff in my salad that turned out to be charcoal.

Also, the outdoor heaters kept turning off every 10 minutes and we had to keep requesting they be turned back on.  The waitress from the next table over had to keep helping us because our waitress was clearly struggling.

You don't expect that at \" The Borgata\", but it's a fact-check it out!  We saw everything from a large group of business people, ladies with their children and 2 young guys hangin' at the bar.

    "text": "I went to Blanco Tacos + Tequila in Scottsdale with my family for my birthday dinner. This is another one of Sam Fox's restaurants, and it serves up modern Mexican fare. Our party of five all got a ton of food that definitely required to-go boxes throughout the meal.  The atmosphere at Blanco totally didn't surprise me, considering it's a Fox eatery. There was the open kitchen, huge hanging lights, centrally located bar and airy feel. It was chic and dimly lit with candlelight, but there were televisions throughout broadcasting football games. It was a great mix of casual and fancy, making it the type of place where it's perfectly acceptable to go and just down a couple margaritas, or have a fun dinner date.  I started with the Blood Orange Margarita ($9), which you should get with salt even though it's a little sweet. It was a strong drink, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  For my meal, I started with the housemade guacamole to go with our tasty chips and spicy salsa, then had cheese enchiladas and finished with a Tres Leche cake. The guacamole was so amazing, other people at the table were also inspired to order it for their starter. I really liked the cheese enchiladas, but, as my mom pointed out, they're more modern in that they're not smothered and dripping with cheese. Instead, they're covered in an interesting creamy ancho sauce. I guess I prefer traditional cheese enchiladas, but there was still a ton of cheese inside the tortillas that made me happy.  The cake was really interesting. Someone compared it to a bread pudding, since it was really crumbly and wet because it was drenched in a milky sauce. I liked it, but it was too rich to finish.  Altogether, I thought the meal was an excellent deal. I would definitely go back for the lively ambiance and tasty take on Mexican food.",

Mexican food is my absolute favorite, and they kill it with the beans and rice. I'm starting off talking about the beans and rice because UM HELLO they complement the meal and they totally nailed it.  THE CHIPS AND SALSA ARE SO GOOD I MUST WRITE IN ALL CAPS TO TRULY INFORM YOU, THE READER, ABOUT THEIR GREATNESS.  Now, for things I can suggest to you because sadly I have not been there enough to try the whole menu (but I will some day, mark my words) are...   the roasted chicken tacos and the roasted mushroom tacos are honestly way too good, its probably illegal for me to be talking about such delicious plates on here. ALSO, if you think sometimes soft shell corn tacos are not that great, these ones will totally change your mind about soft shell corn tacos, and your eyes will turn into hearts.  green chili pork enchiladas, where do I even start!!! My boyfriend had ordered them and lets just say I was so full I was about to explode and I still had like four bites because they were absolutely amazing. The meat, the cheese, perfectly stacked (which, in my eyes is the only way enchiladas should ever be) in a hot skillet, and they are sent from the heavens above.   If you are feeling simple and love cheese crisps, they are quite exquisite and not overdone with the cheese so they are not greasy. Super yummy.  THE DESSERTS! Totally worth trying them all, even though you could die due to food consumption overload, they are all very tasty!!!",

Guacamole - Just ok.  Needed salt and garlic.  Mine is better.    Braised Short Rib & Avocado Cheese Crisp - Ordered because of the 'rave' reviews on yelp.  It was ok but wouldn't have a craving to go back just for this.  Carne Asada Tacos - Dry, disappointed - meh  Pork Carnita Tacos - Good  Slow Cooked BBQ Pork Taco - Excellent, A+  Brown Sugar Carmel Flan - Amazeballs.  Tasted like Creme Brulee.  A must!  Tres Leche Cake - Wasn't a fan.  It was extremely dense.  Roundup - Not my favorite place for mexican food.  Would I go back?  Not sure.  I guess I got it off the check box for another Fox restaurant.",

    "text": "Ate at Blanco last night.. very corporate and super accommodating.. we had a wonderful time which even surprised me.. stuck to the basics and thought it was the best of the Fox restaurants. Seeing that we've never had a good experience until last night says a lot. Was kind of cool seeing Sam Fox there actually quality controlling everything that was coming out of the kitchen.. though you know he was just annoying everyone, LOL!  Had the short rib cheese crisp and you know what, it was actually crispy and good. Then tried the queso fundido con chorizo.. pretty darn tasty.. the cheese was slightly burnt on the bottom which I just love, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla, oh yeah!   For dinner I ordered the machaca burrito.. is there such a thing as to much meat? I swear it was a whole beef roast wrapped in a tortilla.. the Mr had the green pork enchiladas.. I though those were very tasty but the sides were even tastier.. their rice is like risotto, very creamy! Helen Y was with us and she ordered the shrimp and crab civiche which I thought was extremely tasty though I would have loved it even more if it were on a toasted baguette! More like a shrimp and crab salad than a civiche though that's just me..   We ended with the tres leches cake.. this was a pretty dismal attempt at tres leches.. was so dense, chewy and sickening sweet. It was so sweet in fact it burnt my throat, pretty gross!  What a great time! Blanco certainly has a fun open atmosphere and a fabulous patio with VERY comfortable seating out there.. you can order dinner up there instead of eating in the dining room which is very cool! Also, the staff was friendly and VERY attractive.. I think for me, this is the best of what Fox Concepts has to offer so far. Definite mass appeal.",

Service was really good, there were about five people servicing our table as a team. Everything came out quickly and they were able to accommodate all the bizarre dietary needs of our finicky group.  The food itself was pretty basic. The big eye tuna ceviche was a significant deviation from real deal, it appeared to have small pieces of tortilla chips mixed in which through me off. The chicken fajitas were fine, but weren't a huge step up from something you could get at a chain.  Final word: Ok for a casual or family dinner.",

I was bummed when they stopped serving my favorite menu item, the Ahi Tacos, but the grilled fish tacos are a good back-up choice. If you're not that hungry, you can split the tacos and they will bring 4 mini tacos instead of three (so two each) and a smaller portion of the side dishes.   The tortilla soup is also one of my favorite things to order on cooler days.  And it's really good if you add avocado to the soup!",

We ordered a few rounds of drinks and some guacamole to go with the chips and salsa. I had a peach margarita in a sugar-rimmed glass. It was really yummy and they did not skimp on the alcohol! The chips, salsa and guacamole were also really good. The guacamole had huge chunks of fresh avocado in it, which I really enjoyed - you could tell this was not out a can!  The whole time our server was super attentive. Our water glasses and chip bowls were always full, and he was constantly on top of making sure we had enough drinks without being pushy. Juggling a table this big can be tricky but we felt very taken care of the whole time.  If you have a big group, Blanco is very accommodating. I didn't get to try dinner but I would love to go back and try some of their tacos.",

I make a way better flan than that!  Overall, not a bad option for some semi-authentic, modern \"Mexican inspired\" food fare.

Still, it was my first time there, so maybe that's the exception and not the norm. What set Blanco apart and ultimately made us decide to go here was the very welcoming outdoor space on a perfectly beautiful day.  The best part of the food came free, the chips and salsa. I'm a big fan of frescas and cucumber beverages so I ordered the cucumber-kumquat fresca it was very refreshing and delicious. Pistachio and Goat Cheese salad was disappointing; avocados were hard. I don't think avocados were even listed as part of the salad on the menu. If I were preparing it I'd never put a less than perfectly ripe avocado slice on a salad. It's like biting into ice cream and realizing it's \"light\" or being an innocent child who suddenly finds out life isn't fair or finding out the person you love doesn't love you back or...anyway it's heartrendingly disappointing. Please spread awareness about unripe avocados and refrain from serving them anywhere, ever.  But I digress. The patio situation was beautiful and comfortable, but eating a meal out there was very awkward. To make a long description short, the most comfortable ways to eat without occasionally dumping food all over myself were to hold the plate under my chin or lean over the small umbrella stand/table to my left.",

The friend I was with mistook his question and thought he was offering a gift card to tables as some sort of contest, and began to give him the story as to why we were in Phoenix and why we should win.  He was so taken back, that he was very gracious and paid for our meal.  The margaritas were superb.  They are unique and have the right amount of alcohol to mixer composition.

Our server, Tony, was outstanding, and made our total experience wonderful and was refreshing when customer service is lacking in most establishments today.  The chips and salsa were amazing and the habanero salsa is a MUST ask for.  I had the tacos and was pleased that when I couldn't make up my mind because they all sounded so good, that I could mix and match.  I ordered the crispy shrimp, carne asada and the BBQ tacos.  They were all delicious but the BBQ was my favorite (and I can see why it is award winning).  My husband ordered the short ribs burrito and it was incredible.  The beans and rice were pretty good, but I was too full from the tacos and chips.    We are so glad we found a new local restaurant.",

Alex and Chelsey have been very friendly, quick with our orders and very knowledgeable in their recommendations. One of my friends has never been here and they were quite helpful. I've always had great service here    Their guacamole is amazing. A definite must-order. Their food is very good for the price. I'm a fan of their tortilla soup and flan as well.   Margaritas? Great! Today I had the Blood Oranje and the Peach Hibiscus. Both great. They put a monthly special out too. This month is cinnamon vanilla. Sounds odd but very tasty leaving a sweet vanilla aftertaste in your mouth.   I recommend Blanco to a lot of foodsies and friends and will continue to do so.",

Service was excellent - 5 STARS Food was okay - 2-1/2-3 STARS  CHIPS - too thick but had good flavor SALSA - was tasty  PORK TACOS - Very good  CARNE ASADA TACOS (extra crispy) - Absolutely the worst I've ever had!  They were so dry! The taco was a store bought white corn tortilla and baked - completely fell apart at the first bite.  Nothing in the taco but the meat and a little lettuce - it was so frickin dry and tasteless I asked for sour cream - it didn't help.  RICE - White rice, a little corn and seasoned well.  Very different than typical Mexican rice. It was okay.  PINTO BEANS - served in a little dish, tasted okay, very little cheese (goat I think)  if any.  This is not typical Mexican food - I find it's more of a healthy version.  Prices were steep - $14.00 for the Taco meal.  Also, portions are small.  Waitress asked if everything was okay and normally never do this but I told her, \"they were the worst tacos I ever had.  They were so dry and just completely fell apart.  Obviously your restaurant doesn't cook with a lot of cheese,\" I said.  She was nice enough to remove my meal from the bill - hence 3 stars.  I think for many of us eating at restaurants everyone has a good or bad experience.  Usually though with a first bad experience we tend not to go back. End of story.",

I came with a group of 7 girls on Saturday night, and while they told us 35 to 40 min wait, it was only about 15. Score! We shared 2 bowls of guacamole which was delish. The chips were addictive, I told myself I wouldn't have any but these were better than any I had ever had. I had the roasted chicken, green Chile pork, and shredded tacos combo. Roasted chicken was my favorite. The rice packed a lot of flavor, and the beans were so-so. I enjoyed the Paloma cocktail. Yes the tacos were small, but the rice and beans were generous and I left feeling quite full. Sam Fox has yet to disappoint!",

The marinade was also good but a lot of it came with the chicken in the burrito and it got pretty messy, not surprising for shredded chicken though. The rice was VERY good.. pretty sure it was soaked in butter, still delicious.   Overall this place was fine. I would maybe go back again and try tacos but nothing blew me away.",

She was very attentive and prompt.   We ordered: -Mango jalapeno margarita, it was so so and not spicy. The sparkling Sangria was like club soda and juice bleh. -Appetizer - Braised beef cheese crisp with avocado - OMG so good!!! I don't have words. Wish I didn't have to share! -Entree's  - Braised short rib enchiladas with all rice, so much meat and so delectable. I do wish they topped it with shredded lettuce to add a cool and crisp crunch to the cauldron of goodness. Chicken mole - Amazing. Large portion definitely a shareable dish. Tortillas are mackin!  Fish tacos grilled - good, but not amazing. BBQ pork tacos - same as the cheese crisp but add an extra OMG... Seriously! I want to eat those pickled onions by the jar!  Noteworthy - We were visiting from out of town (SoCal) so this is by no means a testament to consistency. Also this was our first cheese crisp and are definitely NOT experts on all things cheese crisp.   4.5 stars because we were disappointed in the booze.

The service was also much more earnest here, we came by for my paramour's birthday lunch, you know that kind of day where it's her day and her parents were back in town for a spell.  We started the day training and then hit Blanco.  I went for Shrimp and Mahi tacos.  I had no issues with the food in the Biltmore location but the service was just extremely slow.  This was apparently our server's last day as he was moving on, he was excited for his new gig.  Very earnest fellow who treated us kindly.  I'm more into the ambiance and center bar of this location.  The Tequila selection was mad...if only it had been a heavy drinking day.",

    "text": "I could go on and on forever about this place. Blanco ALWAYS sounds good and truly never disappoints. Last week I went with a few of my closest friends, and although it was definitely not my first time going, it did remind me why I love it so dang much! The service is superb, food and drinks are always on point, and overall it's just the perfect spot for any occasion - even a random Tuesday night out!   To start, well their chips & salsa are incredible. I mean theirs have to be my favorite around. I also recommend their queso blanco for an appetizer. So yummy! For my meal I got tacos. The best part about Blanco is they let you mix and match your tacos! So I chose the carne asada, chicken, and BBQ pork one (so unique, this one is my favorite)! If you're not a huge fan of beans, I recommend getting either the sauteed veggies for your side, or double rice instead! Everything was sooo delicious, and I had the most amazing time catching up with some friends! Blanco is a must try, and definitely my favorite Fox Restaurant!",

Off the Cobb and mixed in a creamy not-overly-mayo sauce with crumbled cheese topping ... Could use a sprinkle of tajin but really just perfect as is.  The tacos were very delicious! All garnished with different toppings, your choice of tortillas, served with beans of your choice and rice.  Pickled radish for the bbq pork taco, ripe avocado for the grilled fish, and red peppers for the carne asada taco. Deeeeelicious!  My favorite was the hibiscus green tea, just like my abuelita used to make so refreshing and good.  Nothing too crazy with the food but enough change to make the dishes stand out.

Won't make this mistake again!!  The wait wasn't long, but the service was awful, the margarita bitter and the food....just not worth the price.  There was more shredded cabbage in our fish tacos than anything else!!  This place is just too much of a 'scene' for us too.  We might as well have been in LA.  Not a good experience.",

The service was great and the guy that helped us was very friendly which made up for the crumby food.  I think we would have been better off going to the Salty Senorita..  If your looking for a good place for a Margarita and aren't hungry go to this place.",

    "text": "Very sad about Blanco! I love Fox Restaurants and was shocked that this is connected to that company. My hubby and I did a quick date night last week and chose Blanco since we have seen it so many times in passing. The Guac was $9 and seriously the size of a golf ball served in a large bowl. I ordered a dinner salad I think it was $12 for a bread sized plate of lettuce a couple tomatos and avacados and about a half a pound of dressing. I usually get extra dressing on the side but no need for that at this place my lettuce was wilted from the amount of dressing on the salad. This would not have been terrible if it was good but it tasted terrible. My husband took the waiters recommendation and ordered enchiladas. That was probably the best thing about our experience HOWEVER it tasted like cream of mushroom soup out of the can and came in a little petite size skillet for I think $15 or $16 bucks. I would never go back not even for half price. I will stick to sauce and Fox Sports Grill. For Mexican I will make the long drive to Val Vista and Baseline to eat at Nandos. Nothing compares to their food!",

Half price on their crisps (delicious) and starters and house margaritas (all the margaritas on the menu are eliglble). What a great deal!   We loved the chipotle shrimp and corn, braised short rib and avocado and cheese and guacamole crisps.   After consuming a fair amount of chips and salsa and all the crisps we hardly had room for our entrees so we split a few things. One was chicken fajitas which my sister claimed were the best fajitas she had ever had in her life. They mix all the \"toppings\" together with the meat instead of having you add your own ingredients to it. She really liked that. My husband and I shared the Machaca Beef Tacos (braised short rib, green peppers, onions). I loved the short rib flatbread and the tacos also did not disappoint. Yum!!   We also had very good service here!",

Taneko was such a beautiful restaurant and so rich and warm, and Fox just seemed to throw a ton of cans of white paint on the interior and ruined what was a very beautiful dining room. But I get it, with the whole beach theme... it's just kind of ugly now.   The chips and salsa were just okay. The salsa better than the chips. I had heard the enchiladas were good, but I opted for a heathier option and ordered the chicken tacos with corn tortillas. The tacos were incredibly average. I had to scoop out most of the pico de gallo just so that I could hold them. The beans were beans and the rice is not your average Spanish rice, but just white rice with butter and corn. I completely missed any authenticity of real Mexican food. The waitress highly recommended the flan, and I am not normally a fan of flan but we ordered one anyway. I would have rather eaten a Jell-O pudding cup, honestly. It was nothing special at all.   I would honestly not waste my money here if you are wanting real Mexican food. This place doesn't have it.",

The food is decent Mexican food. I am always satisfied and I also always have leftovers.  The best part would have to be the drinks - I love their margaritas - very fresh.  The only negative would have to be the service. Every time we sit at the bar, we receive impeccable service. However, if we sit elsewhere in the restaurant, it's pretty poor.  Overall - a great lunch place with wonderful margaritas",

    "text": "I have eaten at Blanco's about 6 times in the past year.  Generally the food is good, and there are some dishes that are better than others.  The chopped salad is very good, the Green chili Pork Enchiladas and very good, the chips, when warm are better than most, and I have had several Tacos' that are great.  I like the atmosphere, and the decor of the building.  It is a shame that J. Alexander's closed next door, as that take some energy and ambiance from Blanco's.  My chief complaint is the seating/reservations system (or lack there-of).  Generally, there are about 4 young ladies who stand around the hostess stand, taking names, seating people, etc.  It seems that there are about 2 too many.  There seems to be no-one in charge and looks very hap hazard.  Two visits ago, we called ahead to check the wait, and they told us they could take our name, and as we were 10 minutes away, it would only be about another 10 minute wait once we got there.  When we got there, it seemed our name was added then, and we waited 30 minutes.  We were made to feel that they were not honest with us.  We had dinner here over the weekend, and had another issue with getting seated.  We arrived and there was only one couple seated in the wait area.  We put our name in, and said first available.  We were told 10 minutes.  There were several open tables, both in and out.  We had requested not to sit at a tall table, as we had someone who could not do that.  There were 4 of us.  As we are sitting there, and it is now going on 20 minutes, we see a couple being seated at an outside table for four.  Then another couple who was seated at a high table.  Both couple came in after we did.  When I questioned the hostess about this, she told me that the couple seated outside had requested outside seating.  When I asked her why \"first available\" did not beat an outside request, she said she was sorry, but had seated them first.  She then found us a table to sit at.  I am not sure how long we would have waited, and how many people would have been seated had I not spoken with her.  It was just a poor start to a meal, and we had brought guests to experience the restaurant.   I have eaten at many other Fox concept restaurants and find them excellent experience.  Blanco is just not where it used to be, and with all the other choices for restaurants in Scottsdale, not the best choice anymore.",

Nice spacious restaurant with a more than friendly staff who were very attentive to both me and my guest. The food was really tasty. It wasn't traditional Mexican food, but I really enjoyed it since I'm not really into sweating while I eat from hot and spicy food. Try the green chile pork enchiladas and wash it down with a Chucabras' Pale Ale. Lastly, sit on the patio before the heat hits. The place is definitely a scene as well if you're into that kind of thing.",

Our drinks took forever to arrive, and we had ordered an appetizer but it didn't come out so we asked the waiter and he had forgotten we ordered it/did not put it in the system. Ordered the Chicken Mole and there was zero Mole sauce in the actual dish that we could see, had to get a side order of sauce. 3/4 dishes came out at once but no mention of \"oh yours will be out soon!\" Finally we had to ask where the 4th dish was. Had to ask for refills on water/chips, etc. Felt like waiter wasn't paying much attention to us, although he was polite. Food was just OK, my deconstructed \"enchiladas\" were swimming in grease but they were tasty. Someone in my party ended up with corn tortilla tacos even though he had specified flour. Overall atmosphere was pretty cool. Beware the \"Mexican\" food here is not at all typical southwestern, much more of a fusion-type of deconstructed meals resembling more traditional dishes. I probably wouldn't eat here again.",

    "text": "Another hip Scottsdale restaurant...cool, but not charming.   I liked this place, but it's hard for me to LOVE something that almost seems like an upscale chain restaurant. The setting of the place definitely has some cool decor, but some of the people who frequent the restaurant are fairly lame.   The Black and Blue Mojito is delicious; fruit, rum, and mint? Yes please! I hate paying $10 for a drink, but this one almost makes it worth it. During my most recent trip to Blanco I ordered the chicken fajitas. They came out looking much different than I expected. The peppers, onions, chicken, pico, and sour cream were already all together in the skillet, which was different, but still good. They had a bit of spiciness which I liked. I asked for a small side of shredded cheese to add because cheese makes everything better. The fajitas came with four mini flour tortillas (I could have had corn) which tasted great and made for some cute little tacos. I also liked their chips and salsa that came immediately upon sitting down. Being a salt-lover, I was thrilled that the chips were already salted. The salsa was a bit spicy, but I'm a big baby when it comes to zesty flavors.   My server was very attentive. He didn't stay around to chat, but he was constantly checking up on us to make sure my boyfriend's water glass was full. The manager was also walking around to check on tables, which I always appreciate.   Blanco isn't a restaurant that I would frequent, but I did enjoy my visit. 3 stars seems appropriate for a place that is classy and well done, but doesn't blow me away or make me anticipate my next meal there. I'm sure I'll return eventually.",

Because everytime I go, I remember how unimpressive the food is, and I tell myself I wont return. And then I forget and return, and remember all over again. All the food kinda sorta tastes the same. I dont know how else to explain it. Once I got steak tacos (before I went veg) and they were chewy (in the bad way). Yekh. This time around, I got portobello tacos. Not seasoned well at all. Ive had tastier tofu.   And they apparently only season their rice one way. And that is not a good way.   I would return for chips, salsa, and to try their drinks, but I would skip the food. Nothing great about it.",

It reminded me of an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun...  Anyway, I say this is premature because, although I have been to Blanco twice now, I have only had drinks and apps, and I don't feel I know enough to write a full review.  That being said, Brandon rocks. The Blood Orange marg that he suggested was tasty. A second one may have knocked me on my butt, but the alcohol was well hidden. I ordered the guacamole and is was creamy and chunky and delicious (also full of monounsaturated fats- hooray!). My friend ordered the Three Cheese Quesadilla with chicken. She liked that too.  I would like to go back for more margaritas and maybe an order of the fish tacos. And the flan.  Shout out to Brandon.",

    "text": "3-stars for the food, 4-stars for the service.   We hit this place last Wed because we had a gift certificate and walked into an hour wait. Seeing as that we had a sitter and don't have that many date nights, I wasn't willing to waste an hour of it, sitting with spring-breakers in the lobby. After explaining that we were leaving, due to our limited sitter-time, the manager sat us. Immediately. Nice move, sir.  We had great service from that point on. Almost to the point where it was too much, but I won't complain about the attention.   The food is just okay and it always has been. Obviously, if you want real mexican, there are loads of better places to get it. The tacos were decent, but not original and the fundito dip is also very typical. It's like the chefs cater to visitors who don't know any better, when it comes to authentic mexican food. And that's fine, but it's not good.  The drinks are okay. Apparently everyone has to have a blood-orange marg on their menu, right now. However, the one at The Mission-- WAY better, FYI.  My biggest complaint about this place is the fact that it's just typical. And in a city the size of ours, we locals don't have to settle for typical. Unless you have a gift certificate.",

Waitress was nice and helpful, food service was a bit slow however.  Food: Menu has many options to choose from! I ordered:  enchilada style carne asada burrito. *this guy had sooooooo much flavor and cheese topped with an excellent (but not spicy Verde sauce) .

    "text": "Blancos earns five stars from me for 2 consecutive dining experiences: the first, lunch on my own and second, a taco + fiesta party pack order (don't skip the fiesta party pack!) for 15 I placed while I was there, and picked up and served to guests the next day. First, my lunch of Mexican salad and shrimp was fresh, crispy, and nicely balanced; the server was on point throughout and saw to it that the manager would come discuss my party order. Second, the real five-star earner of this review is the party pack take-out: the tasty meal (roasted chicken & braised beef rib tacos) was reasonably priced, expertly packed, obviously cooked fresh for the order, and generously portioned. My guests were nothing but complementary! Unquestioningly, my impression of Blancos has moved up a notch since my last review. This place, folks, is where you should place your next party order (do I need to remind you that Super Bowl is around the corner?).",

If you've dined at Fox Restaurant Concept establishments in the past, you know the Slow Cooked Bar-B-Q is a winner winner, shredded pork dinner. Go with a the charro beans (light, spiced, pinto beans).  The other day I tried the chicken mole and vegetable arroz. It was flat-out superb. The braised shredded chicken is served in a bowl mixed up with the rice and mole sauce with corn or flower tortillas on the side. If you happen to bring home leftovers, you'll be thanking yourself later. Speaking of which, ensure you have leftovers by starting with the guacamole and crispy salted chips. The guac has a faint kick to it, so be ready.   In the mood for enchiladas? You're going to get a cheesy delicious pie. The enchiladas are served up in a cast iron skillet, queso to the brim!  The decorum is trendy and cool. I really enjoy going here, though it can get pretty busy towards the evening. As with any FRC restaurant, you're going for the great tastes and ambiance, but not the price.",

I would go again IF we had no other choice.  The salsa was gross but, the chips were ok. I mean how can you get tacos wrong, right? Well, they managed to do that, lol.

We were told to try the trio of dips that they offer during happy hour and let's just say I crave it everyday ever since. The queso and bean dip that comes with it is to die for and it was so cheap! Our server was also amazing and constantly checked up on us to see how we were doing. She made us feel like we were a regular at the restaurant and have known her for awhile.

Two hostesses at the front, they seemed weirded out I was dining alone. Waited for about 15 minutes, then I was seated, at a rather large table for just myself. Waited another 10 minutes, and a hostess came over and asked if anyone had taken my order, I replied no.   She found a waiter, but he didn't seem excited to have just one patron.  I wasn't drinking, I told him I just wanted an app or two, he didn't seem thrilled knowing that he wouldn't get a huge tip without a drink on my tab, asked a few times if I wanted to know the drink specials, finally I told him I'm driving and can't. Other servers constantly ran past me, brushed up against me, and one even used my chair, yes the one I was sitting on, as an aid in running to the kitchen faster. Not sure if it was where I was sitting, the center of the room, but it was uncomfortable.   Food: Ordered the street corn appetizer and the quest blanco. Was a $6.50 tab, left $11, because I felt bad/ pressured for not ordering a drink. Good portion/quality for how cheap it was.   Overall 3 stars because of experience. It was THAT uncomfortable and awkward being the customer that college freshmen don't want to serve because they know it won't be \"worth it\". (I served tables, I get it)  Will go back but with more people probably.",

LOVED my mojito, and the specialty margaritas were good.   Two thumbs up, will definitely visit again when in the area.",

    "text": "My husband and I went here one Friday afternoon for the happy hour.  We sat out on the patio and the service was quite slow.  We waited about 15 minutes before a server came over to us.  The happy hour margarita was just OK, after two I didn't even feel a buzz which makes you wonder how much tequila they actually put in the happy hour margarita vs. a margarita from the regular menu. The server brought us chips and salsa with our drinks but forgot our waters.  We also ordered the queso dip and a chicken and cheese quesadilla.  The portion of queso dip was quite small and the server didn't bring any chips with the queso dip so we had to ask for them.  The chicken and cheese quesadilla was very pale color, like it had been microwaved and the chicken was sparse and dark meat.  We were very disappointed and won't be going back here again.",

Thanks for a snafu in the kitchen I was able to try both the chicken and vegetarian nachos and found both to be some of a best I have had. The carnitas tacos and chicken burrito are nothing to sneeze at either. My girlfriend had the taco salad and is currently trying to emulate it at home.  The wait staff was also great - water and margarita refills were speedy, and overall level of attentiveness was just right.  Overall - I recommend Blanco. Whether you make happy hour or not, the food and drinks are great, the prices are reasonable, and - unlikely too many other Scottsdale places - it doesn't take itself too seriously.",

The first time I ever went to this restaurant, our waitress knew EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT to that burrito and was extremely friendly.   I definitely recommend going during the day, though, because it gets crowded at night and a little loud. It also can turn a little \"scottsdale/snobbsdale\" at night, and this is coming from someone who lives here. Also the wait time can be pretty terrible sometimes.  Either way, I wouldn't skip this place! I love it.",

First things first, they have a michelada on their drink menu, but don't order it!  Even if you've had wonderful micheladas in the past, Blanco's is terrible, with WAY TOO MUCH worchester sauce and not enough lime...yucky!    The chips and salsa were actually really good, as well as the guacamole.  I had the ahi tacos, which were overseasoned, presumably to cover up the not-so-fresh taste of the fish.  My wife had a veggie burrito, which was huge in size, but not in taste.  The rice they serve with the dishes is to, die, for!  Next time I visit, if ever again, I am ordering just a bowl of the buttered rice...delicious.   The service at this restaurant was borderline terrible, from needing to ask for everything, including more chips and water refills, to waiting too long for food, which then came out on an extremely hot plate, as if it had been sitting under a window for far too long!  And again Blanco, why the attitude? The food is not that great, your servers aren't that hot and your drinks are weak, get over yourselves.",

    "text": "I went to the Blanco Tacos in Tucson when it first opened, and really enjoyed it.  It was more of a casual eatery in a in the back of an upscale shopping center in North Tucson, so I was happy when I heard that one was opened in Scottsdale.  I have eaten at the Scottsdale location on several occasions, and kept putting off writing a review of it, simply because I didn't know what to make of it. Being in Scottsdale, this is, of course, not as casual or as relaxed place as the other.  The food is similar, but the atmosphere is quite different.  The decor is very chic, as are all Fox concept restaurants, and it was well accented with the natural wood and whitewashed ceiling.  They also have a nice outside patio.   The service varies. I have even had it change on me in the same meal.  We once had a shift change during our meal, - the first server couldn't have been more cheerful and attentive, and the second server was just the opposite.  Not rude or incompetent - just indifferent.   And speaking of indifferent, that is their food.  Nothing to rave about, and nothing to complain about.  I have had their entrees, and the best that can be said is that it is good, americanized  mexican food..  That is -  bland, and boring. It is a little pricier than similar mexican but this is the Borgata, so I am sure rent is a little higher.    So even though I like their decor and the people watching, I have little desire to go back for their food.  But I do like their chips, salsa and beer.  So when the better half is shopping, I get my exercise by walking to Blanco's and having their chips and salsa, and of course a the inevitable bottle (or two) of Dos Equis.",

I was born and raised in a border town, spent most of my time in Mexico. Yes, the tacos here are not \"authentic\" but they are equally delicious. My favorite tacos were the carnitas, the green chile pork, and BBQ Pork. Yes, is the answer to your question, I do love pork. The guacamole and the nachos as appetizers are great, I could keep ordering these they are that good. Then there is the Grilled Street Corn. If my review was helpful in picking this place, do not...I repeat...DO NOT forget to try this special treat.  **Hold on I need to wipe the saliva from my mouth.**  I went with a large group of friends on one occasion. I feel for the waiters when this happens but our waiter Manny (Great Name by the way) handled it like a P-R-O! He was on the drinks like no other, his recommendations from the menu were extremely helpful for the guys who hadn't been there. The courtesy this guy extended was above and beyond and he deserved every cent of the tip we left him. I went in for a quick bite after work recently and he is now behind the bar. Soon as I sat down he had my Mango Jalapeno Margarita ready, which I oh so love.  Only reason I didn't give it an extra star was because the first time I went here, my carne asada tacos were cold and the waiter was slightly rude but only because the place was packed. Understandable. But still, don't sleep on this place, great food nonetheless.",

    "text": "I would have loved to give Blanco 5 stars for the quality and taste of food, but there were some complications regarding the service that we received.   My friend stressed to the waiter that she has a bad dairy allergy. Originally, her entree would have consisted of three tacos, a plate of beans, and rice, but she asked for 1) tacos without dairy products; 2) black beans; and 3) no rice (because of butter) but extra beans.   There were several things wrong with how her food arrived. 1) Her tacos came with cream fresco that was hidden under the meat. She ate one, not knowing that it was hidden, and felt absolutely nauseous and was unable to eat anything else. 2) She asked for no rice, but her entree came with it anyway. 3) She ordered black beans but received another kind of beans (possibly pinto?). 4) She did not receive the extra beans she asked for. It was careless how they handled my friend's food, especially given her allergy. She was nice enough to refrain from pointing out the mistake regarding the buttered rice and the beans.  When we told the waiter about the cream fresco on the taco, he seemed unapologetic, and barely checked up on us throughout our meal. The waiter's response to the various mistakes associated with my friend's order was that he would make two more tacos for her, this time without sour cream. The two small tacos took such a long time to make that I finished my entire meal before she received hers. She asked for a to-go instead.   Update on the to-go order that was put in: Blanco put cheese and cream fresco on the tacos they sent her home with.   Honestly, it might have been just a bad day at Blanco, and I might consider checking it out again for the food, because the food itself was delicious. However, the service was so off-putting that we got out of the restaurant in a hurry, and it was even more disappointing that they would put dairy products in her to-go box.   Bottom line: A restaurant that does not care for the health concerns of their customers is not a restaurant that can be trusted.",

We have been back a few times since my initial visit. :)  My first impression of the restaurant is that it is nicely situated in the Biltmore Fashion park. Upon entering the restaurant, you'll immediately be sucked into the warm, rustic environment of Blanco. It is a nice departure from your standard Mexican/Cantina type of restaurants. The decor is simple and modern. The restaurant is quite spacious as it has a large indoor as well as outdoor seating. For those doing private parties, they also have a private room downstairs which has its own bar.   My boyfriend and I were immediately greeted by the hostess. When we were seated, it did not take the waitress long to ask for our drink orders. One of the highlights from this place is that the bartenders are excellent mixologists. I am originally from Atlanta, GA and I have had my fair share of fine dining and drinks. I tell you what though, these bartenders at Blanco know what the hell they are doing. I always order their Sangria or Margarita and it is always mixed to perfection. Not overly sweet or salty. Just perfect.  I usually get the warm queso dip which I love because it is flavorful and not too salty. Ask for jalapenos if you like it kicked up a notch. One of my favorite dishes at Blanco would be the street style tacos. My recommendation would be the Crispy Shrimp,  Red Chile Chicken, Baja Chicken or Carne Asada. You can't go wrong with either one of those, but those are just my personal preference. Also worth trying is the Red Chile Chicken enchilada which comes in a small skillet, piping hot that is covered with delicious cheese and the red chili sauce. Just a piece of heaven for those that love a good enchilada!   Finally, I tried their dessert menu because why not? I tried their chocolate mousse cake with vanilla ice cream. I asked for strawberries on the side. The chocolate cake is perfectly moist and has a right bit of sweetness to satisfy that crazy sweet tooth of mine!   Best of all, every time my boyfriend and I have went to Blancos, we have had great customer service and I think we have had all of the waiters/waitresses at some point or another. Now, if I go there by myself, it may be a different story for which I will update.",

Without looking up anything...\"Mrs. Friedman, we have your table for 2 waiting for you!\" I do believe my jaw hit the floor...  Our Server, Sanders, greeted us promptly, got our beverage orders. We explained we had never been there before. He took a genuine interest in explaining the menu, answering questions, etc.The gal I was with needs Gluten free items, so he was very helpful to point her in the right direction. Sanders delivered some of the most exceptional service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Well Done!   No surprise everything was served hot, fresh and delicious! Everything that was needed to enjoy the meal was brought to the table promptly, smiles galore and lots of thank yous by all that assisted in making our experience exceptional.   The Manager was on the floor assisting the wait staff. The restaurant was extremely busy. He did visit our table where we had the chance to tell him about our experience. Loved that he was out and about and available.   If you are in the area...This restaurant would be a great choice!",

Blanco is now at the top of the list for us after using them this past weekend.   We purchased the BBQ tacos, Shrimp tacos, Beef Enchilada, and Salmon and everyone thought their meal was delicious. The take out containers are portioned so things don't become a jumbled mess inside. As a bonus, we had two big bags of chips included and a jug of salsa which we weren't not expecting.  One major note was that my tacos were not unbearably soggy by the time I ate them which I was surprised by considering they had to be sitting in there for 20-30 minutes by the time I was digging into them. Very yummy.  I also tried the salmon and they do a really nice job.",

While we ordered other items it was completely disappointing and honestly the reason we went was the short rib enchiladas!  They were *out* at 12 noon?

The presentation was so cute.. Was so excited to eat.. but as soon as I bit into it I thought that was a mistake.. there was no flavor, food was very Bland.

We were given a $10 card, expire in 30 days,  in addition to a sincere apology.  Fair enough, but given the apparent frequency of private dinner bookings and a need to close the restaurant completely by 3pm to accommodate - it is just really disappointing (after you have already driven there, found a parking space, looking forward to it, etc).  Apparently the place isn't large enough to host a private function and still serve inbound customers, even a couple hours ahead of a private dinner booking.  We now call before we consider going.

I don't honestly remember him ever stating his name. We waited about 10-15 min before we were greeted. It took another 10 min to get our margarita and beer and were never offered waters. Food was amazing as always! I got the award winning bbq street taco dinner with rancho beans and rice. We had another server deliver the food who finally got us waters. The bartender asked how everything was once we were done eating. We asked to split the bill down the middle with two cards and he lost my card. Took another 10 minutes to find it somewhere in the chaotic bar that had a mess of stuff on the floor. I am never not one to tip but being a former server myself I'm appalled at our visit. Nice dude but he definitely needed help at the bar. I don't know when we'll be back which is sad because this was one of our go to spots. C'mon Blanco step it up!!",

We ended up waiting until 6 and when there was still no sign of us getting called anytime soon, we decided to leave. To this day we still never received a text from them saying our reservation was ready. Also I'm not sure if the valet is officially affiliated with the restaurant but I valeted my car to come back and find that they just parked it on the sidewalk next to the restaurant and left the car unlocked with the key sitting in the drivers seat!!!! This is unacceptable. I have attached pictures of food that I have eaten here in the past. If you're going to go there I would say only their happy hour is really worth it considering a lot happy hour food isn't on the main menu.

My family decided to try the famed cheese crisp. Ours was donned with guacamole, and crispy it was. A little bland for my taste, and I would recommend spending a few more bucks to get more toppings.   I ordered the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas as my main, adding in guac. That addition was essential; they should definitely make it part of the staple recipe. The shrimp and slaw combo was refreshing, and 3 corn tortilla tacos was perfectly filling. It's a rare day when I leave a Mexican restaurant feeling satisfied but not overstuffed. Blanco's portions fit the bill for the right size.   Our waitress was friendly and decently prompt. We will definitely be dining here again when back in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "One word pops in my head when I think of Blanco...that word is delicious! We stopped in here last weekend with some friends and really enjoyed outer meal. There was a minor mix up with an appetizer but it wasn't a make or break for our dining experience.  We all got a margarita, of course. I went with a classic house on the rocks which was flavored very well. My husband got the Italian blood orange and it was realllly tasty. Our friend had the spicy mango rita which I friend and it had an excellent little kick to it from the jalapeno.   We had a cheese crisp as an appetizer which ended up coming out as a quesadilla but they corrected it and provided us with a new order.  For our main meal we all went with the Machaca enchiladas since our friends recommended these as being the best. They were. They were flavorful and the meat was incredibly tender. I would recommend to everyone to try these at least once. I upgraded to the street corn side which was a nice touch. It's my favorite so I was glad to see they offered it.  All in all, we will 100% be back!!",

Of course we started with margarita's, they brought chips and salsa to the table right away and we added an order of their street corn, which is roasted corn with queso cheese, it was so good.  Mr. Bee ordered enchiladas and I had the 3 street taco platter.  The enchiladas were yummy and have a southwest flair. They aren't your typical enchiladas, it is more of an enchilada stack or layered enchiladas. The street taco platter was awesome.  You can mix and match tacos, they don't have to be the same.  I tried two avocado tacos and a short rib taco,  all were amazing.  I wish we had a Blanco Tacos and Tequila close to home.",

Thankfully we only waited 30ish minutes and our server was great. Food came out fast and was piping hot. Manager hooked us up for the abysmal start. We will be back!",

One of the best queso dips I've ever had. The chips and salsa they serve to start off are also good and not overly salty.  I order the Carne Asada Burrito for my meal and my girlfriend ordered their Chicken Fajitas. The burrito was great although next time I'll make sure I get it enchilada style. My girlfriend also really enjoyed her chicken fajitas.   When we initially arrived, we were told that t would be a 45 minute wait but we were seated after a 20 minute wait. The service from our waiter was also great and they always made sure to check in with us and refill our waters  During my visit, I found out that they were opening their first location in San Diego this year! I will definitely make sure to visit once their location opens up here. Looking forward to it!!",

I got the Pork Chile enchilada which was the best part, it came in a cute little cast iron dish too. Although the two sides I got were mediocre. I got street corn instead of rice ($2 more which I wasn't told) and it was really salty. The charro beans had a very odd taste, I couldn't even describe them. The restaurant had a nice vibe but was definitely geared more towards drinking and the bar area. Probably won't return but it's not a bad place, just a bit pricey for the quality of food.",

We had just missed the lunch rush so we were seated immediately though we've never had more than a 5 minute wait or we'll just sit at the bar.  For appetizers we order the quesadilla which comes with a large scoop of fresh guacamole and pico on top of thin and crispy queso pie! Yum.. We also ordered the Warm Queso \"Bob Armstrong Style\" which adds to our queso addiction, just pour that on all you ordered, you'll be great. Entree included the Mahi Mahi and Tiger Shrimp Fajitas which was a generous portion and FINGER LICKING GOOD.  It's almost a win/lose because at the time your rating it's a win and when you leave and return home it's a lose because you wish you were still at Blanco eating. ha! Truuu though!  To wash it down we drank the house margarita, I flavored mine with Hibiscus and chugged that baby down! Bottoms up!  The cherry on top was the churros... ahhhh warm bite size and melted chocolate on the side.  Big thank you to the EXCELLENT staff with the sweetest customer service, always has been 5 stars!",

Drinks: I had the margarita of the month (grapefruit margarita), and my boyfriend and his friend both for classic margaritas. We all enjoyed our drinks.   Food: tacos were decent. We got BBQ pork, carne asada, and carnitas. My boyfriend LOVED the bbq pork. I even liked it even though I don't really like bbq sauce. The carne asada and carnitas tacos were just alright. Our friend got the carne asada burrito and loved it. Biggest hit was the free chips and salsa; the salsa was delicious!  Atmosphere: best part! They have a huge outdoor area with large open doors so the inside could also enjoy the fresh air as well. Very open and bright. It was great to be able to enjoy the sun and nice weather.",

However, I was already on this side of town so I visited the new location.  It has a great spot- right on the corner- easy to drive to and park etc.  It is near Paul Martin's as well- easy to find!  They have a great spot-  with an awesome set up inside and easy patio access outside as well.  We were seated quickly outside and were greeted with chips and salsa right way.  My favorite - TGIF!   I ordered the Mexican Salad and added chicken- and my guess ordered the bbq pork tacos.  Our food arrived fairly quickly and it was terrific!  The salad was fantastic- it looked beautiful but tasted even better!  I loved the guac on top with some pico de gallo- and the chicken was perfect as well.   It was a really large salad- and I was not able to finish the entire salad.  The bbq pork tacos were also great.  They were a little small - but did come with a side of rice and beans as well.  They smelt wonderful, looked beautiful- and tasted great.  We were very impressed- and had forgotten how great this place was! I look forward to coming back soon!",

It is so perfect with their crispy chips! The street corn is also amazing! I would suggest trying out the Blanco salad with Mahi. The Mahi is seasoned perfectly. The lime vinaigrette on the Blanco salad is so great as well! I wish I could take a bottle of it home with me. The staff is quick to get your order out and always on top of drink refills! This is a great spot for big groups! Go get your friends and have some tacos!",

The BBQ are one of their award winning tacos and I can see why. The blend of flavors was amazing. Overall everyone in my group loved their tacos. The only one someone didn't like was the shrimp.

Therefore I can forgive what happened, recommend people give them a shot, and I will try them again in the future. ---------  I feel so ripped off :(  Such a disappointing meal. The service was good, as was the chips and salsa.  But both entrees were truly horrible. The cheese crisp was served well below room temperature.  It was overly crisp and dry, with very little cheese, which had hardened before it was even served. Gross. Never knew you could mess up a cheese crisp, but sadly they did.   We also had an order of 3 tacos. Fish tacos, which usually are very enjoyable when I've had them elsewhere, we're a big disaster this time. They had an overwhelming taste of charred fish and kerosene. We had to drown them in salsa to make them close to palatable, but we still left 1 behind. Overall I am a fan of Fox restaurants, and Mexican food, but this place missed the mark by a mile). We will not be going back.",

First time I went, there was supposed to be a 45 minute wait, it was very busy, but we were seated much faster than that. The staff was friendly both times I went. Great service.  The food was great, the chips and salsa are tasty, but the margaritas and tacos..oh my goodness. I went for happy hour, which includes half off margaritas, and I think these win as my favorite margaritas. I had the white peach and hibiscus, and have also tried the pomagranate/grapefruit. My boyfriend has tried the blood orange and mango jalepeno and enjoyed them as well. As a vegetarian it is always nice to see a veggie taco on the menu. The ingredients taste fresh and the tacos were very flavorful. I always leave very full and satisfied!  Surprised this place only has three and a half stars, it deserves five in my opinion!",

    "text": "Blanco is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants; my girlfriend and I go nearly every other week for drinks and some food after work. The food here is great! An awesome high-end Mexican taco spot! The elote is delicious as well as the drinks! If you are looking for a fun hip taco spot and don't mind paying a little more this is the spot to go, typically 5 stars from me! I love all the Fox restaurants but this day might have changed my opinion of Blanco. On October 17,2017 we went to Blanco and the whole restaurant had changed it's design. The menu had been updated and when we ordered our typical favorites, they tasted noticeably different and were not up to our expectations. Also on this particular visit, the food had cooled down by the time it reached our table, which made it even less enjoyable.  Every time we go to Blanco I usually order the carne asada burrito. My girlfriend usually orders three street tacos, carnitas, bbq pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She substituted the typical rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beans and rice to go along with my burrito. Generally, we love the food. However, we've recently noticed some inconsistencies. As I previously stated, the menu was recently updated at the Scottsdale location and the food seemed inferior to the norm. Also, we stopped by while we were on a trip to Tucson and each received substantially undercooked carne asada, which left us dissatisfied and without appetites. Although the service is usually friendly and accommodating, as with most Fox Concept Restaurants I've tried, this time around they were not as willing to help. When we pointed out the undercooked carne asada, the server brushed it off and did not offer for our meals to be recooked.  The atmosphere is one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant. I love to go during the NBA playoffs because the crowd around the restaurant is really excited and you can feel the energy in the room.  The food is great; everyone is having a great time and the service is prompt and friendly, what more can you asked for. Each location of Blanco's is uniquely decorated, but all have a laid back beach vibe. All locations have indoor and outdoor seating that is accompanied by lively, colorful decor. Of the locations I've been to, the restaurant seems to typically be focused around the bar and the kitchen is within view of customers which also contributes to the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant.   The food at Blanco is priced fairly with most entrees ranging between 12 - 20 dollars. The drinks are slightly more expensive with most cocktails being about $10 each. I like to go during happy hour when there are some food and drink specials. The sangria is a must, and on happy hour a carafe which can get you about 4 glasses is only $18 which ends up being only $4.50 per glass. Overall, I would recommend Blanco! Although we have had a couple less than ideal visits, the restaurant usually has great food, good prices, and friendly service.",

Rice is a flavor of its own and not your typical Spanish rice. Fun hip vibe and their tequila selection is spot on!",

    "text": "The main reason I come to Blanco is for their margaritas - mainly the Peach Hibiscus Margarita as it is divine! I could drink these all night and promised my husband we will come for happy hour and do just that. Seriously, best margaritas. (I've tried their pomegranate one as well, which is really good but the peach... oh, the peach.)   Happy Hour is 4-6pm and half off all margaritas, well cocktails, beers, and some appetizers. We've had their guacamole and we really like their three cheese quesadilla with chicken.  As for dinner, I love their beef 'house specialty' enchiladas - braised short ribs in a red sauce. Super delicious and one of my favorite meals. Makes really good leftovers for lunch the next day as well! My husband likes their burritos and normally gets the machaca. When ordering a dish, you have the option of black beans or pinto beans. I always get the black beans, but I'll have to try the pinto at some point. Additionally, the rice is super buttery and delicious.    I would highly recommend this place for a date, a get together with friends, or if the family is in town. There is always ample parking out front (or valet services), the inside is decorated nicely and the patio is wonderful. I've already promised my aunt a margarita when she visits, but I'll definitely be back before then!",

From the enchiladas to the fish tacos to even the rice and beans. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so this is saying a lot.   The place itself was absolutely gorgeous, from the exterior to the interior. The seating both outside and inside is comfortable (we had moved from inside to outside seating just out of curiosity). Outside was nice because they had heaters since it was Winter, so we thought we might freeze but it was actually very comfortable. The chairs and couches were really nice as well and they had fire pits which you could dine next to (I loved that part).   The bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the service was also great.   It is a bit pricey but everything is delicious, so it's a give and take for sure.   The good thing about this place is that it's great for dates as well as friends and family.",

Except the quesadillas. Those definitely weren't good. I personally wouldn't go to a restaurant and order a $10ish quesadilla, buuutt once a friend did and there really was barely enough cheese to say it was a quesadilla instead of a plain tortilla. Anyway, I've ordered a few of their tacos and their enchiladas. I would recommend their tacos first, of course, really because they were darn cool. their flavors combinations were interesting and definitely worked.  Now, on to their margaritas. If you aren't hungry and jonesing for a margarita, ABSOLUTELY go to Blanco Taco. They have more than the typical margarita flavors and again, they make the atypical flavors totally work. Flavors like blood orange, Sweetart, and I'm pretty sure Ive even had a rosemary margarita there..it might not have been rosemary but something floral nonetheless.",

Our overwhelmed waiter did a solid job of keeping the chip bowls filled for our table of over 15.  Although, when the time to pay arrived, he was a bit flustered.  Two dedicated servers would have enhanced the flow of delivery of our orders and checks.  But he tried his best:)  Everyone raved about the quality of the happy hour food orders.

    "text": "Surviving on the Sam Fox name:  Let me first state that Sam Fox restaurants are typically well thought out and perfectly located.  So I have been to Blanco a half dozen times trying to get the square peg into the round hole...it just won't go.  While many may disagree with me, I also have found that diners, and especially Yelp reviewers, in Phoenix tend to rate the restaurant based on how much they paid for the meal, afraid to admit they simply got duped.  The reviews of Blanco are overly glowing and out of balance compared to sooooo many alternatives in the Valley.  To start, the decor in both the Biltmore and Old Bragada on Scottsdale Rd locations are pleasing but not as hip as the Fox standard.  Both are nice open spaces with large group tables a plenty.  The food is uninspiring and just not cravable.  In writing this review a day after my last attendance, I am having difficulty recalling the few things on the menu that made an impression.  I will try...  The roasted corn is flavorful, but this is a side dish and salad garnish.  The Mexican salad with steak is sparse in the meat department and routinely over dressed.  Fortunately there is roasted corn in the salad to rescue and provide an ounce of interest.  The quesadillas are just boring.  Cheddar and some other overly mild cheese melted on a tortilla.  No seasoning.  No deep flavored cheese.  No roasted corn to rescue (unless you ask specifically).  Additionally, they come sliced in massive wedges that effective tell everyone at the table, \"don't even try to share more than a bit with me, Amigo.\"  Just writing this I am bored.  So I will sum up the rest of the fare on the table.  Salsa=jar quality, Queso=velvet a with milk in a microwave, refried beers= try frying a third time, guacamole=woefully under seasoned and bland, chicken tacos=meh, shrimp tacos= too fishy (not even as good as Rubios).  Lastly the service...oy.  The waitress is quick to greet and ask for drink orders then disappear.  Each of the six times I have been reminded of the \"casual\" in casual dining.  Slowest dinner e-v-e-r..........  The gaps between drinks, apps, entree and dessert ordering are eternal.  Somebody needs to tell the staff that you make more money selling drinks and turning tables.  In 90minutes I didn't see any table turn more than once.  Listen, as a foodie in a great foodie city, I can safely endorse skipping Blanco.  If you want innovative Mexi-inspired food, try Sumo Maya, Modern Margarita or frankly any taco truck to out perform Sam Fox's black spot on his resume.",

I think Blaco even compares to the classic choices in town like Jordan's and ajo als. If you're looking to satisfy your rampant Mexican food addiction, look no further.",

The service at Blanco is the best I have ever experienced at ANY restaurant.  From the Host/Hostess to the servers, these people are top notch.  Fox is a genius.",

Had the cheese enchiladas..( I know, who orders a cheese enchilada?)...but, I have been to some restaurants in CA that make cheese enchilada's to die for..this one not so much...they were burnt on top, they put more cheese and sauce on to cover it up, they were dry and drowning in sauce.

The margaritas were very good -- nice and tart and didn't skimp on the booze.   The salsa and chips was very tasty.   The chips are thick and crunchy and nicely salted.  The salsa is smoky and thick and has nice bite.   We also ordered some guacamole and boy that was delicious!    You get a huge portion.  Very fresh too.  We could have made a meal of that alone.  For entrees I had the shrimp fajitas which I really enjoyed.    They came with corn tortillas and black beans (very good too).   The shrimp were plump and in a spicy sauce.   I liked everything about this meal.  My wife had the fish tacos though and came away disapointed.  Average was her description.    She did love though the flan / fruit she had for dessert.  The servers did a great job too.    We would definitely eat here again.",

I usually find one thing wrong with a place and still give 4 stars.  This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.  (The hostess was the other 10%...very unpleasant...like I was bothering her to get seated....honey that is your JOB!) I met my lovely friend Karla for lunch...she recommended the place and I have been wanting to try it.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup to start and I ordered also the enchiladas with green chiles.  The chicken tortilla soup was a catastrophe.  It was made with chicken broth with every vegetable you can think of, chicken, and WHOLE tortillas.  The tortillas were a soggy mess and the soup was just G-d awful.  The server (who was nice) had the manager come over and take it off my bill.  (Which was nice.)  The manager even said that my soup looked very unappetizing.  Next was the enchiladas...first...I didn't know that enchiladas were supposed to be HARD and CRUNCHY!!!  It was greasy, the cheese was flat out disgusting...and they even put my green chiles on the side when I did ask them to put them in the enchiladas. (Which shouldn't be too hard) And on top of everything else, my rice was BUTTERED WHITE RICE!!!!  In a Mexican style Restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  And it was so unappealing...(this meal I had to pay for...)  There was no Mexican flavor or feel at all in this restaurant.

Rich and smokey and tons better than red.  Tacos are pretty good, especially the steak which was actually grilled/seared rare!",

The atmosphere gives this good-food place its fourth star - the patio, booths, tables, etc. are great for socializing.  The service is friendly and the drinks are great.  Between our friends, we've sampled lots of items on the menu and everything is pretty fresh and yummy - not mind-blowing, but solid.  Highlights include the grilled fish or roasted mushroom tacos - yum!  The cheese crisps are great, too.  I'd definitely recommend the guacamole to go with the chips and salsa - I defy you not to fill up on these.",

I ordered the queso crisp which was like a Mexican pizza. Pretty large portion, probably not meant for one person. But sooo good. Not overly done.   Taco selection is very diverse and obviously gooood.  Note for vegetarians! Rice is cooked in chicken stock!!   And request light cheese for cheese enchiladas!  Ambience was great; really good selection of drinks too",

They are served in a mini cast iron skillet and come out super hot and fresh. Chips and salsa were awesome too!  Blanco is back in my good graces!",

When we got there, the wait was 1hr 15min. It went by pretty quick because we got some drinks. Th I cocktails are great!!!! My sister got the pomegranate margarita which she loved and I got the mango jalapeno. Both were amazing!!!! The chips and salsa were also great. The service  was ok. Not great. Our server kept disappearing! We started with the street corn which was great. Served off the cob. We got 2 separate tacos! We did the BBQ pork and the short rib. Both were great but the ours came out missing crema on the BBQ pork which would have added a great element that's almost necessary. The butter rice is awesome and hard to stop eating! I also have to point out that I pretty much micro managed the bartender to make me a skinny jalapeno margarita and it was phenomenal! So if you love a spicy marg, have them muddle a TON of jalapeno into the skinny marg! YUM! I would be happy to come back here!",

I wanted to try one of their margs and our wonderful server suggested the watermelon rhubarb one so I took her advice  After looking at the menu I decided on the award winning BBQ pork tacos with rice and beans  The tacos and beans were wonderful I should've asked what kind of rice it was going to be as I am not a big fan of creamy rice... I left that on the plate... And devoured everything else...  The margarita was tasty and really hit the spot because it was about 109 that day and I needed something to cool me off  The flavor of watermelon and hint of lime was excellent...  All in all I enjoyed Blanco and look forward to visiting again perhaps at the Biltmore location...   Thank you to the wonderful server for making this visit enjoyable and resurrecting",

Gabby was our sever and she did a great job offering suggestions for a nice combination of tacos for each of us. There was a DJ and the place was reasonably busy for an early Saturday night. A great option for casual dining at a very good value. I would recommend the Slow cooked BBQ pork and the Baja Chicken tacos. They'll mix and match your order of 3 tacos and serve them with beans and rice.",

Pretty sure that is not how its supposed to be done.   Servers would much rather stand around chatting than actually looking after customers.  Most Fox restaurants are about a 3 1/2.  This one IMHO, at best a 2.",

    "text": "I'm still feeling my regrets for coming into this place. What a joke.    My mom and I have this thing about Mexican food/tex-mex restaurants in the valley-we've eaten at most all of them. When we go out for lunch, we generally look for a new one to try in the area we plan on being in around that time. Unfortunately, this is the place we stumbled upon.    Our server seemed already \"put off\" by us for some reason..I'm blaming it on the fact that I was wearing something with a pattern so he automatically knew I must be one of those \"artistic\" types who like real food and not some shitty Mexican version of Fuddruckers. We were doomed from the start.     I'll save you the details just because even I'M annoyed by how annoyed I was with every interaction with my server. After looking over the menu, I decided that I wasn't that into anything and just wanted a burrito.   Word for word:   Me - Can I get a burrito, beans, rice and sour cream only.     Oh and can you grill it, or put it on your flat top?   Douche - WELL YEA THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT,....pFFFTttt, HOW ELSE DO YOU MAKE A BURRITO. WE ALWAYS MAKE THEM LIKE THAT   .... ...  ...   Me - Oh. I usually have to ask. Okaaay.   - Server puts in the order then comes back.   Douche - SO DO YOU WANT THAT ON THE FLAT TOP BECAUSE IT'LL FALL THROUGH ON THE GRILL.   Me - Yea that's fine.   Douche - LIKE TACO BELL   Me - Ok.   ...   inner monologue Me - LISTEN DICK, YOUR MENU ISN'T APPETIZING SO JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING TORTILLA  A BEAN AND SOME TOMATO SO I CAN HAVE A MEAL WITH MY MOM THAT DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND YOU BEING AN ASSHOLE.   ehem..   Food came and I ate about a third of it before noticing little chunks of bacon in my burrito. THANK GOD I'm not a real vegetarian even though I say I am, I eat seafood and will try meat when I feel the quality of meat is on par with excellence at restaurants worthy of my money..    I also got the pleasure of witnessing about 11 plates of food up on the line for about 5 minutes, just sitting there while the servers folded silverware into napkins and talked about Carlos Mencia...or something equally as boring.   Needless to say, I reluctantly left a tip.      I walked away immediately feeling nauseous and thoroughly grossed out by the whole experience - now 24 hours later - I have a headache that won't go away, what feels like the stomach flu and an intense feeling that I can never enjoy a burrito again.    ..I hope the lack of interest in burrito's is a phase, Blanco, for your sake.   I'll never betray you again, Taco's Jalisco's.",

    "text": "How good can a cheese crisp be?! Come here and find out! All of the cheese crisps are delicious but my favorite one is the short rib and avacado. I've had a few of their tacos. None of them are mind blowing but they're good. I would reccommend the crispy shrimp taco and the fish taco. Margaritas are great. Everyone I bring to Blanco ends up loving it as much as I do. This is one of the few restaurants I will go to knowing I have to wait because it's that good!",

If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend.  $50 for two entrees and two draft beers, no thanks.",

    "text": "This was our first visit and of course first impression is a lasting one. The server came right away to our table. We ordered guacamole with our chips. The salsa. chips and guacamole were really good. The margarita was really good. The three carne asada steak tacos, black beans and rice were excellent.  The service was spot on, and the waitress gave us salsa refills and fresh chips without having to ask. The only thing to improve and the reason I gave four stars instead of five was the flies inside near the windows kept annoying us and trying to get their dinner portion. The restaurant needs to keep the front door closed and figure out a way to control the flies inside the restaurant. But overall excellent food, service and ambience. I will go back but will not sit next to the window.",

    "text": "So coming back!  No snobbery here. Everyone was polite and gave us great service. The food was delicious. Ordered the braised pork tacos and my hubs had the carne asado burrito. The chips were just the right salty and the salsa was full of flavor and not extremely spicy.  Definitely coming back to try other food on their menu plus I'll bring friends.",
