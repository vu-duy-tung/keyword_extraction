    "text": "I tried Florencia Pizzeria for the first time last night. I ordered a large thin crust pizza and small salad for takeout and was told to arrive in 15-20 minutes. The location is very easy to get to, and the parking is so-so. I was expecting a packed restaurant as all the spaces near the entrance were taken but when I walked inside, the place was maybe at 65% capacity. I know it's nit picky but it was a head scratcher for me, and when you are taking your pizza home you want somewhere near the exit to get in the car and take hot food home. Inside, the restaurant was clean and quickly seemed very family friendly- with lots of kids. So keep that in mind if you are a younger couple seeking a quiet \"romantic\" dinner- this spot is definitely kid friendly (good for me!). I walked up to the bar and was immediately attended to- there were 3 or 4 staff members behind the counter and they were expediently helping other patrons. I remember the place playing good music in the background (sort of indie themed) - with some Postal Service and MGMT. I paid $23 for the food (that includes a tip) - so I was happy with the prices. The pizza arrived a few minutes later, nice and hot. After getting home the family ripped into the food- and it was very good. The crust is the standout here- crispy, almost burnt. Very, very good flavor. The sauce seemed to be on the sweeter side- and the cheese was good. It was a little greasy, but that's because they put a lot of cheese on. The salad was good- and the house balsamic dressing was awesome. We will certainly be back to Florencia's for another trip- maybe bring the kiddo and eat inside next time!!",

Perfect crust that is pillowy yet thin, a large variety of toppings to chose from and a great base for any pizza - awesome maranara!  Florencia offers a great variety of pizza combinations as well as a make your own option.  The Raspotle pizza with a pesto base, chicken, roasted red bell peppers, feta cheese and a raspberry chipotle sauce is incredible.  Their plain cheese pizza or cheese and sausage pizza also tops my list.  The salads are fresh - try the Spinach salad with fresh mozarella, bacon and the best balsamic vinagrette dressing you will ever taste!  Florencia also has a fantastic selection of craft beer, wine and a small dessert menu.  Service is efficient and friendly but be prepared to wait for great pizza - they make it from scratch and it takes a little time.",

Had the Patagonian the first time which was a unique pizza, chicken, pepperoncinis, green olives, feta cheese and the pesto/tomato sauce.  Really, Really good.  Second outing was the Margherita, which i thought had a ton of flavor for just having a few ingredients, real mozz, not the plastic shredded junk, kinda sweet tomato sauce, and shredded basil.   Also, the have some really good beers on tap, and a couple of big tv's behind the bar.   This place rocks, our new pizza place.",

Well he hit the nail on the head because my husband loves meat as well. This is what we ordered, however, we added green olives, and onions to 1/2. This by far was the best pizza I have EVER had! The staff was assertive and overall amazing and the ambiance very comfortable!

The review steered me from Spinato's and drew my attention.  I will be sending him a private message of thanks in just a bit cos he was right on point regarding Florencia's. Florencia's is thinner crust and perfect char, not cracker crunchy and not chewy; the sauce, cheese and toppings were fresh, flavorful and pair very well with the crust.  Not a whole lot of grease either despite the fact I had pepperoni and bacon as two of my toppings. Yeah I'm a fan.  Thanks Yelp...you did me right...again!",

The salad arrived pretty fast, since our server placed the order in BEFORE asking us which pizza we wanted.  (Our pizza also arrived later, bec. the kitchen took extra time to wipe down the oven's surface of as much cornmeal as possible to mitigate possible allergic reactions I might come down w/...)  Believe you me, this pizza was worth waiting for!  The mista consisted of mixed greens, tomato wedges, crunchy walnuts, feta, and Florencia's fantastic balsamic vinaigrette.  (You can purchase the vinaigrette to take home!)  This salad was so delicious and so much fun to eat (crunchy walnuts, creamy feta, and tangy vinaigrette were the secrets to this simple, yet delightful salad!), I could see myself coming back and ordering a small order for my main meal and be completely satisfied.  In fact, I WAS satisfied w/ my half of the salad and could've gone to the movie we were planning to see, but didn't, bec. we had to wait an extra 30 minutes or so for the pizza to arrive.  No worries, though, as the Clevenger was even MORE spectacular than the Bravo I tried the first time around!  (And if you read my first review, you can see how much I loved that combination-- I ate half of the medium pizza at one sitting!)  I apologize for the terrible photos of the pizza I've included here... (My Mac powerbook is in the shop and isn't available to correct for the dark lighting.)  Bon appetit!",

You're here because they have awesome pizza.  The service is good - nothing to rave about, but friendly enough, and they kept my drink full. The pizza on the other hand, was incredible. I didn't go off of the menu - I created my own, so I won't just brag about my incredible sense of taste, but the ingredients were very fresh, and the pizza was cooked to perfection.  A little bit more atmosphere could kick this place up to 5 stars easily, but hey, if you want atmosphere go somewhere else. If you want awesome pizza, stop in here.",

Like, uncomfortably cold. I know, I know...Its summer in Arizona but I actually went to my car and got a sweater. Other than that, everything was spectacular. This place is super amazing. We started with the Misto salad. O...M...G...fresh mixed greens, walnuts, mozzarella in big slices, a hint of fresh basil and some of the best balsamic vinaigrette Ive ever had. We decided to try the olive oil pizza which has garlic and olive oil instead of red sauce. We got the one with ricotta, broccoli and garlic. Folks, this is a fantastic pie. Simple and delicious. I cannot wait to go back. The dessert menu was nothing special so we didn't have dessert but who cares. This is some of the best food I've had. Get there.",

I live about 1.5 miles from the store.  The Margherita. As soon as i opened the box, i knew it was garbage. Imagine a piece of dough, SMOTHERED in sauce, with about 5 blobs of cheese on it. I dont know where this is considered pizza, but im glad i do not live there. The pizza was cold.  the crust was undercooked, and was stuck to the butcher paper in the box.  Even after re-cutting the entire pizza, when me or my kids tried to pull a pice out, all the sauce and cheese( If that piece actually had cheese on it, because yes, some slices didnt have any cheese at all)  just slid into the box, leaving us with a flimsy, cold piece of dough. EPIC FAIL  The Patagonian. This pizza was just a shard better, as far as flavors go. But, it also was cold, undercooked, and stuck to the paper in the box.  And lets not forget the prices. LMAO!!  I thought Papa Johns was over priced.  Florencia has them beat, hands down! I do not know what you are paying for, but i DO know that i will NEVER give them another penny, and i will do my best to let as many people know about this failure as i can.",

They served all of my favorite beers ie left hand odell stone ballast point etc. We started off with their antipasto salad....best salad I've ever had in my entire life. Make sure yu get their homemade balsamic dressing. Their pizza was exceptional, crispy crust on the bottom with a soft gooey layer on the top. They had 4 options for pizzas, traditional pizza sauce, olive oil , pesto, and ranch. They offer many pizza combinations  You are going to find something you really like",

The owner is very nice and always talking to his customers making them feel welcome. I have been living in this area Phoenix for 15 years and this is by far the best pizza I have had in the entire valley and it just so happens to be a couple miles from my house... Thank God. Did I mention that the owner is a Dodgers fan... That's a bonus!!",

    "text": "Florencia is the closest pizza place to my home other than Dominos, so I have dined in a few times as well as ordered take out.  They do not deliver, but it is close enough that I can place a phone order and the order is usually ready by the time I get there.  SERVICE: Service is hit and miss.  I'd love to say they were spot on all the time because everyone is so darned nice there.  There are problems in a couple areas:  1.) It can be difficult to get refills, napkins, or anything really after your food has been dropped off.  We have experienced this on a couple occasions, even when we were frantically removing everything off the table when a friend's child spilled my child's glass of milk.  Even having made eye contact with the hostesses who were looking on, it took several minutes to get anyone to come to our aid.    2.) They seem helpless when it comes to splitting a bill, even though we mentioned when we were seated we would need two bills and essentially sat by family at two different tables which were just pushed together.  When there was a problem with one bill, it took 20 minutes to correct the problem.  We wanted to get our kids home, but the waitress had our cards so we had to wait.  And, even with someone's help, our bill still came out wrong.  We paid it so we could just get out of there.  FOOD: Some things are GREAT.  Some things are just MEH.  The panini pizzetta is a huge hit with DD.  It's better than their garlic bread.  Their homemade balsamic is addictive and AMAZING.  The fresh mozzarella they put on the Caprese and Spinach salads is so delicious!  One time I had The Green Eyed Chicken (a pesto pizza) and it was FANTASTIC.  Another time I had it and it tasted extremely bland... like they forgot to put something on it.  The Snow White pizza is very bland.  Ditto for The Ranchero, which is surprising.  We really thought it would pack more flavor; however, it just tasted like seasoned chicken on bread with some cheese on it.  AMBIENCE: I actually like this place.  It is very cute, but not overly so.  It is a little dark in the dining room at night.  It is usually great for conversation, as it is not too loud most nights.  Overall, this place is nice for a get-together with friends.  They have beer specials and they're conveniently located for Foothills residents.   Let's call it a 3.5* to be generous.",

Florencia is another great example of the good pies that are adorning our eateries.  While not quite in the same league as Bianco, LGO, or Humble Pie they still make the trip to Ahwatukee worth it.   The crust is light and very tasty.  It holds up very well against the big boys with their coal or wood fired ovens.  The margherita is simple and allows the crust to shine.  My only complaint would be that the sauce can really make the end of the piece very soggy.  We've tried several combination's and they all pass muster. One of the better spots to eat in that part of town.",

This is the third time we have been seated and sat here for 10 minutes without even an acknowledgement from the many young women standing behind the bar. They are always apologetic when they finally get to out table, but we shouldn't have to wait that long. The pizza though is delicious and worth the wait.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue. My family and I have been going here for several years now and we really enjoy it each time we go.  Our most recent visit was this past week.  They have excellent salads and their house dressing has a great flavor that works with a number of the salads. We have five people in our family and each of us has our own thoughts on what makes a great pizza. The variety of pizza choices Florencia provides on their menu meets each of our expectations.  They also have a variety of craft beers and typically there is one promoted at a lower price that you don't find at many places. Our daughters love the cookie dessert too.  When in Ahwatukee and looking for a nice family evening out, Florencia is highly recommended.",

You can find both here.. and not just at an average rating but this pizza was very tasty! The menu has a lot of pizza options both in white pizza and in red pizza and pesto pizzas too. Ranch pizzas look interesting too! Who knew? There are salads ; great apps ; Italian sammy's! It's a fun little bar too, so my husband and I had a wine while we waited for our pizza order. We took our time and we're asked if we needed to sample anything on the wine or beer list... which was nice! We liked the U of A memorabilia too and it was fun to learn the owner is a Wildcat alum. We got our pizza and salad : A combo ( mushrooms, pepperoni, onion, italian sausage , olives , and peppers ) a small Stefanos , ( thin crust 'white olive oil pizza ' with garlic , usually feta but i substituted ricotta , kalamata olives , spinach and tomatoes) and a Spinach Salad that was loaded with bacon and goodies .. to go and were reminded that sometimes just driving and finding a new local place brings a new treasure to you! That's what this is! Now added to my pizza favorites list!",

    "text": "This little hidden gem in Tukee serves up an A+ pie. It is somewhat small on the inside, so there is a bit of a wait on the weekend even for a party of two. The waitresses are always on top of things and provide A+ service.  We always order the BBQ Chicken za and it definitely deserves an A+! It always comes fresh and cooked perfectly. I am weird and like the crust edges to be a tad burnt, but not tooooo much. Mmm. Burnt edges. The tangy capers in the pizza add a flavor that compliments the sweeter BBQ chicken. They do offer other Italian menu choices, but the za is too good to not get.   It is nice having two places in Ahwatukee that are worth going to in the same complex (Angry Crab). If you are ever in the area and have a craving for a solid pie, this place receives a passing grade.",

    "text": "I really hated to give this place less than 4 stars. I live very close, and all the rave reviews....  I actually searched the reviews to see if ANYONE had a similar opinion.  Yes! Chrystal hit the nail on the head in my opinion.  You see, I didn't order thin crust, but the crust was soooo thin you can't even pick it up. Just limp and thin as paper. But without being at all crispy.  I was very disappointed. I was also very hungry. So I tried to lift out a limp piece and dig in. Really needed to be eaten with a fork and knife.  Not much cheese either.  The good part is the actual  toppings were fresh and there was a decent amount of them.   This could have been a very good pizza; if it had a crust that was edible. And it would have helped if the pizza had been hot! It was cold, and I got there 10 minutes early to pick it up. I've had pizza delivered that were actually hot! Hmmmm... Getting close to two stars when I think of it.  I  don't think I will give it another shot - even mentioning a thicker crust. You see,  Spinatos is the best, and I even like Rosatis better.  And I always get thin crust at those two- and they're crispy and yummy! And they both deliver.   But I gave  Florencia  3 stars because the toppings were very good.",

It is literally one step up from Domino's.   I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, and for people to say this is authentic NY pizza is just completely disturbing to me.   The minute I opened the box my jaw dropped. It didn't even look like NY pizza, and the crust was horrible. It was really repulsive, but I have come to realize that people on the West Coast know nothing about East Coast food, and maybe to them this pizza is deemed acceptable, but I am left speechless by this. I have spent $18 on better things, so please, stop claiming food to be from NY unless you truly know what NY food tastes like.",

The comments on service seem to be spot on - upon arrival I was summarily told to go to the bar to pick up my order by two smirking teenagers who shouldn't be serving as hostesses for a restaurant. Completely unprofessional.  I'm lost on the accolades for the food. We started with the pesto bread which was devoid of flavor.  The tomatoes, cheese...everything lacked zip which I feared was a precursor to the combo pizza we ordered.  The same experience was had with the pizza itself. The meat toppings weren't greasy which was nice but it was entirely bland. The sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies all had little flavor.  We were disappointed and we wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "Florencia Pizza Bistro is one of those locally owned neighborhood eateries. Ahwatukee has a lot of these little hidden gems because most of them are located in strip malls. This one has been around for quite some time and resides next door to the popular Melting Pot. They offer three types of pizza - Traditional, Olive Oil (Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Mozzarella Cheese with no tomato sauce) and Pesto (Basil Pesto Sauce with no tomato sauce). You can create your own with toppings (over 40 topping choices) or choose from one of their popular specialty pizza creations. Some of the names include the Snow White, Pomodora, Valentinos, Winchester, Clevenger, Malanzane, Bo-Be and the Green-Eyed Chicken. There are many more creations to choose from and they have vegetarian options as well. The dough is house made and their pizzas are thin-crust. I'm more of a thick crust person myself but actually found their thin crust quite enjoyable. They also have panini, calzones, salads and sandwiches if pizza is not on your radar. Their appetizer menu is not incredibly large but they have a nice variety to choose from. I got the mozzarella sticks and felt they were just average. We ordered the Clark's Classic pizza which consisted of pepperoni and chicken marinated in buffalo sauce. I was a little worried the sauce would soak through the thin crust and make it soggy but it actually held up (even eating it as a leftover the next day). There is a small bar area to the side where you can order a glass of wine or beer. The owner is a Wildcat fan (boo...) and they've had fun fundraisers in the past during the annual ASU/UA football game to benefit the local high schools in the area. It wasn't very busy when I visited but service was pretty good.",

We were given a gift card to Florencia and now I'm mad we didn't start coming here sooner!!! I'm obsessed with the Winchester which is a white pie with chicken, mushrooms, and feta. My husband is an easy extra cheese and pepperoni guy and it never disappoints! We get small individual pies and I'm always satisfied after half so I get to save the rest and relive the \"yummy\" for lunch the next day. For the two small pies it's about $24 which is really no different than we've paid for large pies (to share) from mediocre places. The inside is really quite cute and though we've only done takeout, we'll definitely be dining in sooner than later. The hostesses and ladies behind the bar are always super friendly when we go pick up our food and I appreciate the \"family\" feel of the restaurant. Definitely a favorite!!",

    "text": "After a long day of nursing a hangover and a long night of pretending to not be home because we didn't have any Halloween candy for trick or treaters, we decided we needed some pizza. I drive by Florencia everyday and we keep saying we need to check out some of the establishments in this shopping center. Yelp says it's good, so obviously, I trust the palettes of my fellow Yelpers. We headed up there, it was pretty dead and the owner met us at the door and said we could only get takeout because they were closing up at little early. It was only about a half hour early and the guy was real cool about it, so we were fine with it. We went up to the bar and ordered a 12 inch pepperoni and italian sausage. All the girls at the bar seemed really sweet. They told us about 15 mins, so we sat down to wait, one of the girls came around to offer us something to drink while we waited, which I thought was nice. I can see some of the comments about the decor. At first I thought it was odd that the floor is just concrete, but it actually all kind of grew on me after sitting there for a bit. It has kind of a rustic tavern-ish feel. We started talking to Val, the owner, who was a real nice guy. Telling us about the place, they've been there for 11 years I think he said, so it's a nice neighborhood joint. He was real down to earth, just sitting at the bar drinking a beer and catching the end of the game. We noted that they had a pretty interesting beer selection both on draft and in bottles, which he said he rotates fairly frequently. He seems to have a pretty strong passion for beer and real interested in getting in some local brews and interesting selections in there. We got our pizza home and it was cheesy and delicious. The crust wasn't super flavorful, but the texture was perfectly crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The sauce had good flavor and the ingredients tasted like high quality. The pepperoni had a real nice rich flavor and the sausage had a nice flavor with the fennel and other herbs and spices. True it was a little on the expensive side but I'd rather give my money to a nice guy like Val than to Domino's any day. I'm looking forward to heading up there again to sit at the bar, watch a game and enjoy some more pizza or perhaps one of his calzones with a local brew!",

It was a Friday night and relatively busy, although the server could have been quicker, she was friendly and capable. We ordered an Antipasta salad ( Large) , it was excellent and I considered a good value, next came a Calzone, equally good and reasonably priced around $10.00. Then came the pizza, a 12 inch vegy gourmet type that had a smattering of vegetables and a nice light crust and  tasted great, but for $19.00, I could have passed. definately overpriced ! What are they thinking ? Other than the fact that I find it hard to swallow their overpriced pizza, the experience was okay and we may return.",

We are ready to order our food at the same time as ordering our drinks, appetizers will come out with, or after, the main dish, and if we need additional refills, or anything extra, it just doesn't happen. We see our server take our order, and make her rounds throughout the entire restaurant, casually visiting with other patrons. I understand the need to engage, but we've seen this happening where she actually sits down and continues those conversations. Even for a simple drink order. I am referring to one particular server; however, I also make eye contact with other servers who simply walk by without stopping and/or they all visit (among servers) near the bar/drink station. Normally I wouldn't leave a review like this, but it's happened now in the past numerous visits.   We used to come to Florencia's often; sometimes multiple times a week. Now, we just can't justify spending the money when we aren't getting good enough service.  If you don't mind waiting, and these types of things don't bother you, then by all means, order Pizza Margherita, and you will enjoy!!",

So, I am rounding up and here we go....  Atmosphere: inside this evening was dimly lit, comfortable, warm feeling and homey. It's exceptionally clear that this place is not a chain, but more like being in a comfortable family home atmosphere. There is plenty of room between tables to feel like you're sitting at a private table with lots of personal space. Layout is open and spacious. Bar is separated from the dining room with freestanding dividers and plants so it's easy to have the experience of your choice, while still feeling comfortable and open.  Service: The service here was outstanding. The servers all seemed to be young ladies who were all exceptionally friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and prompt. To be honest, they all had \"ownership attitudes\" as if they were all family members of the owners. For the 20 of us sitting on the patio, we were able to ask anyone passing by for anything, and they were all more than happy and willing to help. Each one always had a smile and a positive attitude. It was great! Another table had a puppy out on the patio that was super cute and it's awesome that Florencia's offers a puppy patio!  Food: was super stoked to learn that they offer dairy free cheese on their pizza! I'm guessing in their pastas and salads also. It's rare and awesome to find this and sure makes it fantastic for those of us who can't  do dairy (there were a couple of us). They also offer gluten-free options, not an issue for us, but really nice to know that they care about their customers enough to offer it. We had several different salads, they were all fantastic. We also ordered about eight large pizzas. Their sauce is outstanding! Crust was perfect, thin and flexible with a little chew and pull. Generous amounts of cheese and the perfect amount of toppings made these large, clearly 100% homemade, pizza is absolutely phenomenal! Two of us shared a large, non-dairy cheese Hawaiian pizza and it was excellent! Nice bar with daily drink specials all day and a good selection to choose from.  Value: The value here at Florencia's is very good. They offer a small, medium and large pizzas, custom make your own or they have specials. They offer a variety of salads, pastas and a great appetizers at reasonable prices. Drink prices are not budget-busters and their drink specials run all day at great prices.  Would I go back to Florencia's? Yes, absolutely! It's so great to have a well-run and comfortable, family owned and operated Italian restaurant in the heart of Ahwatukee. If you are anywhere even remotely close to this location, I highly recommend you stop in for what is sure to be an outstanding experience.",

    "text": "This place came recommended to me by a friend.  When we walked in, we noticed that the bar area to the left was a little hectic, so we opted for a table outside.  The tables outside are nice and the string lights really help the ambience.  The noise from the road was a little loud, but that didn't really bother us.  The whole restaurant, inside and out, has a warm neighborhood restaurant feel to it.   The staff seems to be quite a bit younger which I don't mind at all.  Our waitress seemed new but she did a good job despite not really knowing the menu.  We picked out a Mista salad for our first course which was really good.  For our pizza, we opted for the Combo which wasn't quite thin crust, and wasn't thick.  It was right in the middle, and it was delicious.  You can tell that they definitely use fresh ingredients here as that is reflected in the taste of the pizza.   Although the bar area was busy, they definitely serve good drinks.  I tried the Orange Blossom beer and my wife had a Cabernet that she said was one of the best she's had in a while.   I would like to try this place again next time I'm in the neighborhood.",

Not saying I'm not a fan of garlic but there was not enough dispersement throughout the whole pie. Overall taste wise the sauce was just okay. Nothing worth remembering considering the crust tasted like cardboard and the mozzarella sticks were soggy. First time coming to this place I believe I made the poor choice of doing a takeout order rather than having it fresh out of the oven. I am a bit disappointed and will consider my next order thoroughly.",

This place, whether dining in or taking out is always delicious. I can say that because I've done both. Very romantic and dimly lit inside, perfect for date night. But also has a small bar area that has a sports game or two on, but it never gets too loud. Or, if you're home and want something better than delivery and definitely a lot better than Little Ceasar's, then this is the place to go for pick up. We have found that after our many visits, our favorite appetizer is the Barry's Pesto Bread. Be mindful though, this does come with walnuts. That being said, you'd think, \"Walnuts do not go on bread!\" Oh but my dear reader, they most certainly do, especially with the pesto, pepper, jalapeno and mozzarella combination. It's one of those odd but happy couples. Our favorite, which is a tough one to choose from is definitely going the be the Gladiator. Close was the Margharita pizza. The Gladiator just suits my carnivoric appetite a lot better and is much more hearty. We always order a medium because we never learn that we really need a large. Great place. Great food. And definitely opt for some red wine if you dine in, great selection.",

They serve excellent beers from local breweries and elsewhere. The pizza is delicious and uniquely made; good enough that locals might order it for take-out to bring home for guests at a party. I've also had calzones here and they were excellent. The atmosphere is cozy, quaint, and fun, while somehow maintaining a family-friendly environment at the same time. The staff go out of their way to be friendly.   Not a destination unto itself; but a fun place to dine or have a beer if you live in Tukee or are in the area.",

We drive all the way in from Chandler and they barely acknowledge that we are there. And we are somewhat regulars! Last night it was especially bad. I was seated initially by myself as I was waiting for my date. The all female about high school age waitstaff walked by my table at least 5 times, did not make eye contact, did not even ask if I want a glass of water. I was getting ready to just leave when a waitress came closer, I asked if there was anyone covering this section, when she approached the table with quite an attitude. She looked down her glasses at me and said \"oh your waitress is busy and she will be right here.\" I said \"I've been sitting here for over 10 minutes and NO ONE has even noticed.\" She huffed and walked away. My waitress came up right after and I reluctantly proceeded to order. We spent about $40 on pizza and a glass of wine. Very unsatisfactory customer service experience. Will lose business over this even though the food is great.",

We walked in and everyone knew them, and I swear everyone who walked through the door after us knew them too.   We had a spinach salad, which was sooo yummy, fresh mozzarella, really good dressing and pieces of bacon, yea bacon! Then we had some pizza, and I've been craving more since.   There is a pizza I want to try next time we go, it was like chicken and raspberry chipotle. Sounds interesting, I bet it's awesome.",

    "text": "If you want blah pizza go to Pizza Hut. But if you want cheesy, tangy, saucy pizza, come to Florencia! I am from NY and I was really pleasantly surprised by this little gem. I am what you'd probably call 'a pizza snob.' I am REALLY hard to please when it comes to my pizza. NYC has some of the best NY style pizza in the world (I'm not even going to touch Chicago style. THAT'S a different review and I don't need my house toilet papered.)  Florencia's does their pizza right and they know good service. Everyone there was so nice. I only have two complaints. One is the size of the large pizza. It is a little disappointing. It looks very small for a large. Second, and this is just personal preference, I prefer my crust to be a little on the crispy side. Their crust becomes a little soggy. It just doesn't stand up to the sauce very well. But other than that, the pizza tastes amazing! And their prices are pretty reasonable, too. Unfortunately, I won't be going back because they aren't close to where I live (I was visiting a friend across town). If you're listening, Florencia's, you need to open up a 2nd location up in North Phoenix where I am. There are few decent places to get pizza up here. Come save us!",

This is perfect thin crust pizza - not that doughy pizza. Such yummy food. Highly recommend this place!  One note on take out: They tend to say \"20 minutes\", which really means 30-40 minutes. But who cares when the food is so good!",

Going in, expecting bad service, I was still amazed.  We actually received NO service.    We showed up with our 11 month old daughter.  We were warmly greeted by the hostess.  That was the last time anyone came to our table.  We sat there for 30 minutes before we asked for service.  The nice hostess ran away.  She came back and told us that our server would be right with us and asked if she could get us some water.  10 minutes later, the server came out with water.  At that time we decided to go elsewhere.  However, considering all of the great reviews, we decided to give it another go.  This time we got take out.  We ordered three pizzas and I was underwhelmed.  The pesto pizza was the best that I tasted but I have had better.  I agree with D.D. who said that the pizza was bland. Ultimately, I don't think that it is worth the effort.",

    "text": "The BF and I went here for lunch today as we had purchased a groupon for this restaurant a few weeks back and wanted to go to total wine anyway, which is close to the restaurant, so we headed out. We got to the restaurant and it was not too busy, just a few tables. The restaurant was a nice looking restaurant, it was painted a nice color and had interesting metal wall hangings. We're having pizza for dinner tonight so we decided to get a couple sandwiches and the bruschetta. Our server seemed pretty miserable to be there and had a really flat voice. She was not so pleasant. We got the bruschetta and it was not exactly what you would expect. It was like a cheesy garlic bread with tomatoes, garlic, basil, and their balsamic dressing on it. I thought it was pretty good, although the tomatoes were not so fresh and the bread they chose was odd for a bruschetta. The BF, however, really didn't like it. He thought it tasted 'weird.' So then we waited a bit and our sandwiches came out. Here is the real reason for the bad review. The sandwiches just weren't good. I got the chicken panini and the BF got the meatball parm. The meatball parm was really bad. The sauce had no flavor, the meatballs tasted like they were once frozen, and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese on top, like 3/4 of an inch thick. My sandwich was ridiculous. It was giant and looked like a giant salad on bread. The chicken was a breaded cutlet... not super tasty, and supposedly it had their balsamic dressing on it, but I couldn't taste it. It had a lot of raw red onion on it which took over the flavor, and when I took it off all I could taste was the 'pizzette' bread which was overwhelmingly garlicky. I love garlic, but this was too much. It was almost bitter in my mouth. So maybe their pizza is good... I don't know, but what we got was not good. Like so many restaurants, I think this place could use better ingredients and give you much smaller portions for the same price and it would be a lot better.",

We ordered a garden salad to share amongst our table and a specialty pizza.  Overall, I was underwhelmed. They advertise that they sell the dressing for their salad but I found it to be a bit watery.  As for the pizza, parts of the crust were burnt and overall the flavor left something to be desired.  We ordered the Pomodoro, which was listed in the menu as coming with eggplant.  When the pizza arrived I discovered that the eggplant was fried, which I would have liked to know. Since other patrons have raved about the pizza I would give it another chance, but n based on this trip alone I wouldn't give a strong recommendation.",

And the sausage was spicy and plentiful.  Artichoke hearts were extra, but well worth it.  Crust was thin and soft, made the pizza somewhat foldable, which I like.

The sauce is unique and sweet, and I've never been disappointed by the quality of their food overall, especially the Margherita pizza and pesto cheese bread!  Now that I'm living in the north valley, I always try to find a pizza joint that's half as good as Florencia.  The only downfall to this Ahwatukee gem is that the service is sometimes lacking, as it could be hard at times to get your server's attention, causing  food to take a while to make it to your table.  The problem seems to be that there are usually 3 greeters at the door standing around, but only 2 servers helping tables!  I will say, though, when we became regulars, we would ask to sit in one waitress, Carrie's, section, and she would already have our order in for us when she saw us coming!  If the rest of the servers could give the attention she did, service would be top notch.  Overall, Florencia Pizza Bistro is my absolute favorite pizza place in the valley; I only wish it wasn't so far away now that I've moved!",

In this case, it was good. It didn't lower the overall taste of the pizza.   Like many good pizza joints, they can get busy, particularly on the weekends.

Well I need not look any further than my own neighborhood!  Florencia Pizza Bistro Does NOT add cheese to their sauce!!   I rushed right over to cure my pizza craving.   Inside is definitely more bistro, no primary color pizza parlor here.  It was kinda dark, there was some Italian music playing, and it was still casual.   We decided to order a Large pizza half pepperoni for the husband and half no cheese add mushroom, artichoke and basil for me (see pics)  As you can see they did not skimp on my veggie half. The pizza was seriously delicious! The dough was out of this world, it was so light, I can't explain how tasty it was you'll just have to see for yourself.  The sauce was extremely fresh tasting too and I normally don't like a red sauce, but I really liked the flavor of theirs.   They have some pretty creative combinations on their pizzas I highly recommend giving them a try if you are any sort of pizza aficionado.   I give it my Vegan Stamp of approval, there is something for everyone.  Check it out it just might be your new favorite!   *Notes of interest*   *Only open for Lunch Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Monday -Thursday they don't open until 4pm   *Large patio with misters.   *Bar area with 2 Flat screens   *They also have salads, calzones, panini and sandwiches",

Great atmosphere, fun bar, best staff and service ever.  We are so lucky to have a local favorite hang out.  I am addicted. Keep doing what you're doing.",

    "text": "on thursday we decided to try a different pizza joint in ahwatukee since it was on our way to the casino.  pizza: loved the pizza here! our normal pizza that we order is the hawaiian pizza and we added bell peppers and sun dried tomatoes. i was impressed with the homemade crust and the fresh toppings. the sauce & crust was delectable.  the bar is wine & beer only: the server gave us sample a papago beer called orange blossom and it tasted like a creamsicle or a cream soda. my taste buds were so confused..is it dessert or beer? it's unique tasting. anyways we ended up with a blue moon for the mister and pinot grigio for me.  atmosphere: when we walked in it was jammed packed with tukee locals.  families, couples and older folks enjoying some conversation and pizza. noise level was was a bit loud, but it didn't bother me. the place was packed and made for a fun atmosphere.  prices: the price for the pizza is a bit on the higher side but so darn tasty. i would say the beer and wine are average prices.  i can't believe this place was kept a secret from me? this is what pizza should taste like. delizioso!",

Not sure if I'll try this place again.  Grimaldi's seems to always be the best.",

    "text": "Ahwatukee might not be on most peoples list of places to visit while in Phoenix, but after tasting the great thin pizzas here at Florencia's ... it's strongly suggested that it should be.  This locally owned establishment has a variety of calzones, salads, sandwiches, paninis and pizza ... but IMHO, the pizza is what really shines!  They have a long list of pizzas to choose from (Traditional to Specialty pizzas), but what makes their pizzas awesome is the dough.  The dough is made fresh daily, along with the daily made mozzarella. Combine these two very fresh ingredients with your favorite topping and what you have is a classic style pizza that will take you back to Italy.  They don't over do the pizzas with lots of sauce or flooding the top with toppings.  No, here ... they get it that pizzas are an art form and each custom pizza is a work of art.  They taste great 30 minutes later, but are amazing straight from the oven.  You can go and wait hours at those hip pizzarias that cater to the $$$, but if you just want a great place to chill, have a beer or a glass of vino and amazing pizza ... you have to try Florencia!  Ciao Bella!",

I don't think there's ever an evening where this place hasn't been busy!  We tend to order the antipasta salad with their house dressing. This dressing you could drink straight out of the bottle it's THAT good! The mozzarella is always fresh and they place large slices of it around the plate.  The calzones are little pockets of heaven. You can create your own unique combo of ingredients or stick to one off the menu. Whatever your decision, it's sure not to disappoint!   The pizzas are AMAZING! The dough is pillow-like but able to support a plethora of sauce and toppings. There are plenty of pizzas to choose from and again, you can't go wrong because all the ingredients are fresh!  There's always a special posted on the chalkboard sign out front...and it's usually named after a regular customer.",

And drinks came quickly. I ordered a Gladiator med pie and my wife ordered a Panini.  When the food arrived at the table, I requested pepper flakes and parmesan.  After 15mins of not seeing our waitress, I got up and took them from one of the many empty tables.  To the food that was ordered.  Lets start with the Panini, I wouldn't call a sandwich made with pizza crust a panini, the taste (according to my wife) wasn't anything to rave about.  Now to the pie, I am not sure where other people order pies from but here is my feedback: the crust, this was soft and part doughy didn't do well with the toppings on the pie.  The sauce, was not very flavorful at all, more like ketchup.  Overall very disappointing with the service, food and the cost.  Save your $$ and pickup a frozen pizza at a store.",

What impressed me most though was the service I received on my last visit. I ordered carry out and got there a little early so I was paying while waiting for my food to come out. I could see they seemed to be having trouble with their credit card machine (I can relate I have had problems with mine at my business as well) so I was getting ready to pull out some cash to pay when the person helping came back and said i didn't hear the guys name but he told her to tell me it was on him so I assume he was the owner or at least her boss. I didn't complain at all and was planning on paying cash and they just took it upon themselves to give me my pizza for free since they were having problems with my preferred method of payment. Impressive pizza and impressive service. The only other thing I've had is a side of meatballs and those were good too.",
