I have probably had every item on the menu throughout this 12 year relationship and have never had anything I did not like. Here are my top 5:   1. Gyro Feta Pita (loaded with gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and feta) 2. Spring Mix Chicken Feta Salad (Enough to feed two people) 3. Calamari Feta Salad (Crunchy and tasty)  4. Penelope Pizza (Chicken and Artichoke) 5. Fresh Warm Pita Bread (a must have)  The restaurant is cozy, casual, clean, and the staff is very friendly and prompt.    I have tried other Greek restaurants in Phx that have either been way to gimmicky or a total bust and none compare to Crazy Jim's. If anything ever happened to this place I would go \"CRAZY\"!!!!!!",

    "text": "Although it sounds like a wack-job fly-by-night TV warehouse just from the name, don't be fooled nor should you underestimate the impressiveness of this grub-haven on 15th Ave. Last weekend my friend and I had an intense craving for Greek that neither Pita Jungle nor other places could handle.    We realized that this place Crazy Jim's might be up to the task.  I had been told multiple times by friends who work in Central Phoenix about this place (another location on Washington is bonus), only to find myself busy, wanting something else, blah, blah, blah.  The freshly made gyro feta pita was heavenly. The pita was fluffy, the gyro strips were tender and flavorful and the feta cheese and tzatziki dressing were the icing on this cake, so to speak.  The accompanying steak fries are thick and crispy. Bobo opted for the spicy beef pita and was lovin it.  The environs are rough around the edges, but this low-key and spartan cafe delivers, amid the sound of local radio piped in via loud speaker.  The focus here is on the food and nothing else.  The servers were prompt, friendly and chatty, but not too much.  The menu is rife with tantalizing options including pita pizzas, pastas, subs and burgers, but I've never desired to stray from the solid and delicious pitas.",

I had a chicken Swiss salad (I asked them to give me mix greens instead of Iceberg and they did.. with a charge, but I was happy to not eat iceberg). Kinda expensive for lunch.. but very much worth it... Do not judge a book by the cover, its cute inside and the staff is nice!",

Service was good, the food was just ok! Their menu was basically fried foods and or a ton of salad options a few calzones and subs nothing we think of when you think Greek... No cabbage, or eggplant... Shit we ordered a Greek salad and when it arrived I was surprised to see the lack of feta,olives and yellow peppers! I asked why the salad was missing all the typical Greek toppings and was told their Greek salad didn't come with it:/ what? Ok well I asked for it and $3 later I had a Greek salad:/ not sure if they've had a billion people say the same or need them too, but note to crazy Jim's greek salads come with feta, olives and peppers as well without $3 upcharges!!! Anyways we won't be back mainly because we live over an hour away, but second if we do come back in the area we wouldn't return because it just wasn't that good!",

They have several locations, but this is the one I like best.  The atmosphere is Mediterranean-casual. It's the kind of atmosphere I love that reminds me of past adventures in remote corners of Athens, or or little hole in the wall places on the Spanish coast.  For those who don't travel, that means the tables are Formica topped and too close to a noisy kitchen, the aisles are small to non-existent, and the the lighting is an inconsistent no-frills kinda thing that leaves people in one room struggling to read the menu while those in the other room are wishing for sunglasses.  I've seen bigger bathrooms in motor homes.  The only thing missing is the European coffee that no one seems to be able to imitate here. Or maybe they just don't want to.  The menu is big enough for anyone to find a favorite.  They have traditional Greek salads with and without lettuce, pizzas of all varieties, pasta, gyro (pronounced yeer-o) platters and sandwiches, and fantastic calamari.  Dishes are big enough to split, and the pita bread is soft, and fresh off the grill.",

What it lacks in atmosphere is made up by the warm pita bread, large servings and everything feta. I don't usually eat salads for lunch, just not enough food. However, a salad at Crazy Jim's is a satisfying, delicious meal. The Greek salads can be topped with huge strips of grilled chicken, tasty gyro meat or calamari. The lettuce-free salads, called Crazy Salads, are to die for. The tzaziki sauce is great and most of the combinations in the salads are also be served as pita sandwiches. Fresh down-home food that never disappoints.",

Must do something good to the kitchen staff, because everything was quite tasty.  Mad props to the delicious gyros - piles of delicious meat on top of a soft pita bread barely large enough to handle the mammoth pile of savory beef.    No need to order extra tzatziki sauce, the amount given by default was plenty and unlike many gyros the meat was still tender and moist.  Love the crazy decor inside and the friendly staff just topped off the experience.  Would definitely recommend to newcomers in the area since I never would have found the place by judging by the sparse building outside.  This Jim *IS* crazy...crazy delicious!",

She couldn't get over the size of the side salad with its delicious creamy Greek dressing. Really, I have always been satisfied here.",

Sure the pita bread is good, the produce is fresh, the portion sizes are large and the service quick,  but I found the overall experience to be nothing more than mediocre.  The gyro was bland, the feta and olives were nothing more than grocery store passable, and the seasoning was non-existent.  Perhaps I am overly critical, having eaten at great Greek restaurants in other cities (I've noticed that ethnic places - Mexican aside - are over rated across the board in Phx), but as a 'Greek' restaurant this place falls flat.  However, as it is a change from the ordinary casual dining venues, and is close to home, I'll likely be back, but next time I'll choose the pizza or pasta, (with a side of pita) as the Greek and 'Crazy' salads did nothing for me.",

For $19, we had 2 gyros and sides.. a lot of money for not a lot of food. Gyros were very salty, small, dry..and .. well, I've had better :( Maybe I'm homesick for Chicago, and what a universe of Greek food there was out there.. lemon/garlic potatoes, tender gyro slices cuddled in hand-stretched pita.. there's no way this place could compete against, say, Cross Rhodes in Evanston, Illinois, or Larsa's in Skokie, IL.  It's just a different planet out here in dry, dusty Phoenix.  You get what you can if it's something \"exotic\", and try to like it.  I understand that small restaurants like this struggle to compete, and I appreciate that there's always a balance in the industry between what to offer and how much to charge for it.  The bottom line, profitability, is ultimately everything.  That was clear from our meal.   Sorry...I wish I could have liked it.",

I was taken to Crazy Jim's for the first time when I moved here several years ago... and I remember it being somewhere on the avenues downtown - obviously, I didn't know my way around the Valley yet.  Now I'll never forget where CJ's is located; it's easy - on 15th Ave just south of Indian School!  Upon entering, it's easy to tell that CJ's has been around for a long time - it's comfortable, casual, and packed during lunchtime; filled with regulars I would assume.  (I'd be a regular if I lived or worked closer to the location.)  I can only write about their salads and pita bread, but that's enough for me... the pita is pitalicious - I could eat the whole basket if I weren't so carb conscious.  It's sweet and savory and served warm and oh... so good!  The feta they use in the salads tastes like it's straight from the dairy farm; it melts in your mouth.  I have to explore the other menu options one day, and I have a feeling they won't disappoint.  I definitely will not wait so long to return to Crazy Jim's!",

My first time trying the salad, I thought 'peppers and onions' meant they would be raw, but they were cooked with seasoning. Calamari was a tad rubbery, but it was fried so still tasty. Perhaps it was an off night because our hummus was low on flavor. I expected the order of hummus to be a bit larger, it came in two medium taco cups. For me, if this was a $18 meal it would do, but I wouldn't pay $29 for it again. However, the service has been warm and friendly each visit. And the Greek dressing is great!",

I haven't had anything bad on their menu, but the by far the best dish is the crazy salads. All of them are amazing and there's nowhere else in town to get a salad like that - no lettuce but cucumbers, cabbage, tomatoes, etc. instead. The feta cheese and pita bread that come with the salad both taste like they are made there from scratch - if they aren't you can't tell the difference. They also have the best salad dressings in town. The creamy greek and roquefort are my favorites. Both are a must try!  Next time you have a busy day at work and can't make it out of the office for lunch, call Crazy Jim's and you won't regret it!",

As for the pasta...I just wish that for a Greek restaurant, they had something more than Italian versions. It's not bad and the portions are hefty but I could jut go to an Italian American restaurant for spaghetti with meatballs.  I do like their baklava! The portions are huge! On my last visit, I saw they've recently started serving breakfast on Saturdays (8 to 10, I think).",

Food is flavorful and big portions. Not too sure why others are saying differently about the food. Definitely a must try.",

    "text": "I feel so blessed that I haven't had to write a bad review lately.  One reason is I ate at Crazy Jim's!   Soooooooo good.  The hummus was creamy and you can tell freshly made.  The pita came out a little differently than I'm used to.  Instead of just warmed, it seems it was maybe fried in a little olive oil (I'm guessing) to make it a little crispier than other restaurants and tastier.  I'm a fan of this style. I got the chicken patra pita and there was so much chicken, cheese, and peppers that I had to eat it with a fork and knife.  There was no way I could pick that baby up and eat it without everything falling out.  The chicken was tender and juicy.  The tzatziki sauce was delicious.  My side salad was full of green, leafy lettuce.  Quality food.   Our server was so overly friendly too.  I can't wait to go back!   YUMMY!",

    "text": "I had been to Crazy Jim's many years ago. The friend who took me there was a huge fan, and I remember not being super impressed.  Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated has been singing Jim's praises, and over the weekend I was craving gyros. I asked him to take me, and he did. Complicated ordered the flaming cheese (saganaki) which was quite tasty. I had the gyro pita, which comes with choice of fries, salad, pasta salad or lemon chicken soup. I opted for the soup. The soup was incredibly bland and tasted mass produced. (I have been spoiled by Cypress Pita Grill - theirs is amazing!). The gyro was serviceable. Pita was fresh and tasty, the tzatziki was one of the best I have ever had. The meat? Well, it looked and tasted like gyro meat, and I was hungry - it did the job. Then Complicated pointed out that he once bought a case of gyro meat from Restaurant Depot. And hey - this is the exact same stuff! Looking closer - this was not sliced right of the rotisserie. Every piece was identical in thickness, length and width. And each had perfectly rounded corners. Bah! Why did he have to say that? Now I know Crazy Jim's uses prepackaged frozen gyro meat. Instead of prepackaged frozen gyro meat that's at least put on the rotisserie and sliced just for me. There shouldn't be a difference. But there is. And Jim's drops down on my list. I'll stick with Cypress Pita Grill or Athens Gyros when the cravings hit. Maybe I'll explore other items on the menu - I like the room - and I adore dining with Mr. It's Complicated - so I'll venture to other items and just stay away from the gyros from now on.",

Location isn't really the best, but if you're really into food, then going the distance to even the sketchiest of blocks is a must-do. Crazy Jim's is a small place just off of 15th Avenue and Indian School road. The prices are fair and the food is pretty good. I go for the chicken pita, which is always fresh and tasty. The chicken is seasoned well and is moist and the feta is as good as feta gets. This place is great for a lunch date, but I'd shoot for other options for dinner.",

My best guy friend who lives a block away and I ventured over for lunch today and hotdamn, we were not prepared for what we had.  As soon as we walk in we look over to our right and see a massive, sexy, salad topped with beef, feta, veggies and peppers. I think our simultaneous heart-flutters could be heard, as the couple looked up at us and smiled. We were seated quickly, which surprised me given the tiny dining area and it being prime lunch rush time (12:30pm). Our hostess wasn't the most cheery, upbeat girl I've had the pleasure to be seated by, but it was quick and no nonsense so no big deal there.  Our drinks came out quick and we didn't feel over pressured due to our indecisiveness, our server was very polite while checking every 4-5 minutes to see if we'd made our selections. It took us a few checkups but we made our decisions and we eagerly anticipated the coming fury of gyro and beef via pita and salad. Our meals came out quite quickly (around 7-8 minutes) and we were not disappointed.   The fries I received with my Gyro Picado Pita were the thin oil fried type and with a light salting (and peppering) they were delicious. My dining mate's salad looked great as he picked pita pieces and went to town with gusto. No complaints from his side of the table. Also, we had several refills on drinks that were quick and did not interrupt our feast.  My pita sat for a few minutes while I chowed my fries down, as I like to savor them hot, and I immediately regretted not delving into the gyro sooner. I probably didn't even need my tzatziki as the peppers, jalapenos and gyro meat were all perfectly tasteful. I usually try to keep my portions smaller, but there was absolutely no chance of that happening, I took down the pita in probably a minute and a half flat.  We got a box for leftover salad. Check came out quick and was returned quick. All in all, a great experience. Quick, filling, delicious and well priced.",

    "text": "My first experience was a few days ago. I honestly would have never dined here if my friend did not have me tag along. This is one of those times where I can say I am glad I had the opportunity. This west side location is worth the travel.   What crazy is this place is super tiny. The setup is different but there is plenty of seating. You seat yourself and the wait staff comes immediately to take your drink order. Even though I was not that hungry I still had to try something. The menu had a variety of greek options to choose from  for all food fetishes. I ordered the Chicken Lemon Soup while the server recommend I add some Pita Bread. My friend ordered one of the most amazing salads. As I waited for my food I glanced at the other patrons entrees. I have to say all platers looked amazing. I did not hear a peep out of anyones mouth. My food arrived in a responsible time. It was extremely tasty. The pita bread is probably the best I have ever tasted. Matter of fact I heard they make it fresh. I could go there just to eat that. This is definitely a place I will travel out west for soon. Service with a smile and a belly full of food at this venue.",

Oh and the sangria was really excellent also. Not to mention four people ate and drank for under $70!",

The husband and I got lunch at Crazy Jim's and it was awesome! This place has house made sauces and dressings and house baked breads... that's fabulous! I had the chicken picado pita... a fresh, hot, thick, perfect pita piled with delish grilled chicken, peppers, onions, and jalapenos... top it with the tzatziki... you don't get much better than that. Oh, and it came with a side... I chose the lemon orzo chicken soup... a huge helping of chicken soup that was fresh and fantastic. This was under 10$. Wow. The husband got the steak sandwich and fries... also fab. We definitely need to come back here, in fact, I think it's the husband's new fave place.... what are you waiting for? Try this little place... it rocks.  PS the only problem with CJ's is they don't have skordalia...... get the skordalia going and I won't even think of another Greek place.",

We lived in Tempe, so it fell off our radar for awhile, but now it is back to regular visits and we've shared the secret with a few others...and we moved to SE Chandler and still go!  Baked feta is a great appetizer. I don't know what brand of feta they use, but it's creamy and fabulous. Their pita are just the best - I dream about their deliciousness. Soft on the inside, served warm with a toasty exterior. Yum! We often get the flaming cheese as well - a favorite with the kids.   We like the chicken feta pita, the Ellen pizza, the pasta with mushroom sauce is delicious, salads are good. Don't pass up on the olive oil bread or the homemade taziki sauce.   This place rocks. It's a small restaurant but the food they serve, they do quite well.",

Parking is also a bit \"tight\".  During lunch there is a parking monitor to keep spaces open for customers, during peak hours its sometimes still a challenge to get good parking close to the building.  Inside, the atmosphere is definitely mom and pop/family run small restaurant in feel and style.  Seating is a bit limited, so be prepared to be patient sometimes to get seated, especially if you are more than a party of four. The service is good, not necessarily fast, but they are attentive.  The food is excellent, pitas are light and fresh, salads are crisp.  I usually have the chicken picata pita, but the gyros are good too,  I have never ever in three years had a bad meal there.  Great for lunch if you aren't in a hurry, call ahead for seating or for take out.",

The gyro meat is very good, very soft, moist and had deep flavor.  4.5 stars for the gyro.  Service is very nice and friendly.  However the customers here seem really unhappy when they are eating.  Just about all the customers were like that, in a pissy, whining, or upset mood.  It's not a good idea to eat food when you feel that way.  This place is not recommended for a date.  Get food to go if you are in the area and need good, decent quality mediterranean food.",

I'm not going to say it tastes the most 'authentic', but it is unquestionably satisfying.  It starts with the bread, because if you're not ordering a gyro on your first visit, you're doing it wrong. The pita is T H I C K. Flavorful. Heavy. It serves as a great foundation. The meat is tasty, the toppings are good and have plenty of customizable options. I had warm feta to top mine off, and it was great despite almost being too rich. They are very generous portions.  You can get pizza, beer, and a variety of other dishes at an affordable price, so you've got nothing to lose by giving it a try!   Just be warned that parking is a bit of a pain.",

We arrived at 1:00 (which you have to either get here very early or kind of late at lunch as they get packed!) and almost had the place to ourselves which was nice. The waitress was very friendly and took our drink orders while we decided on what to order. It was a hard decision for me as I usually get the shrimp pasta with the feta/butter sauce but I decided to be different this time and ordered the Calamari salad with a side of fried goat cheese. Their salads are huge and this one was no different!  It was simply delicious with so much fried calamari, fresh vegetables, and other goodies that I didn't hardly need any of their homemade blue cheese dressing (that I just love!) to eat with it. My friend had their grilled Salmon salad and the piece of salmon that came with it was a very good sized piece that was cooked perfectly. They serve their salads with a basket of grilled pita bread and I was so stuffed that I ended up taking quite a bit of my salad with me to finish up a little later at work.  I will definitively be back!!",

She never came back to ask us how the food was or to bring a bill. We got up walked to the front and she was so shocked to see us lol well not everyone has time to sit around and waste!

Pizza, pizza pizza  okay I am a pizza snob, and Crazy Jim's is one of the places that has different and amazing pizza. Sorry to say I ate the whole thing myself and now my jeans are too tight and I feel like a pig but who cares when you're eating something so good.  okay Crazy Jim's is easy to find on the east side of 15th ave with a pretty good parking lot .

As soon as I walked in I could tell hostess chick was not happy to see me at 30 min till close. I ordered a gyro with greek salad and abaklava.  She told me they don't have greek salad but for additional cost, she can add feta to my regular salad. Say what? \"If you love greek food, you have to eat here\" or some other such nonsense that is written on the business card. Business cards that have the closing times crossed out and rewritten with sharpie. Super ghetto. Got home. No baklava. Called and she asked if I'd like to come get it or have a credit? Neither. I'd like the difference refunded to my card. The one good thing I can say is that they didn't argue and promptly refunded $4.12 to my card next morning. The meat inside the gyro (I bs you not) is like paper thin uniform pre cut deli slices a and my gyro was dripping grease. I ended up just taking a Caesar side salad btw. The gyro was super gross and I was honestly awakened at 2am by nausea and spent the next hour in the bathroom. I feel bad for anyone who goes there regularly. Maybe you don't know better but if you wanna see the difference for yourself, go have real, authentic, fresh, deliciousness at Athens Gyros right f down the street.",

Fish is not easily found in the desert. They have the absolute best house salad dressing. I don't know how they make it but it taste creamy and lemony at the same time.

But my hub and I went there for lunch yesterday and both of us noticed the change in portions.  Back in the day we could only order an appetizer and a crazy salad.  The portions were big enough we could share and be perfectly fed without being too full.  So yesterday we began our lunch with our normal ordering style and when the food came we realized the portions were so much smaller that we had to order more food.  We also noticed the plates and serving platters were smaller.  Clearly Crazy Jim has decided to deal with the crappy economy by giving patrons less food and charging the same price.  The food was still very tastey.  The service was still fair (never been great).   But as the ecomomy is hitting us too, we decided Crazy Jim's has now been moved from the \"Awesome Crazy Deal\" category, to the \"Maybe if I have a craving\"  category.      Bummer.",

Do yourself a favor and try any of the salads preceded by the word \"Crazy\". They are no-lettuce salads consisting of mountains of cabbage, cucumber, onion, and tomatoes with a light oil and vinegar dressing and topped off with huge chunks of feta and the meat of your choice. My fav is the Crazy Gyro, which is pretty self-explanatory. Plus, all of the salads are served with their pita bread. Bonus - the pita bread is fantastic! Try any of their pitas if you're not in the mood for salad, you won't regret it. My sister also swears by their pizzas. The Ellen is her preference - white sauce, chicken, cheese and spinach on a pita bread crust.  Seriously, is there anything that their pita bread can't make delicious?",

I don't go too often, but when I do, I'm always happy I did.  I've only had a couple things on the menu: the teropita appetizer, the steak pita, the jalapeno burger, and the pepperoni pizza.  You can't go wrong with the teropita.  The soft, chewy dough is filled with a delicious egg and cheese mixture and is to die for.  I highly recommended you start you meal with this.  The steak pita is wonderful and what I always order - tender beef, grilled peppers, mozzarella, and grilled onions (which I always omit) on a wonderfully soft and delicious pita.  With it, I order a side of fried.  Do yourself a favor and order the fries extra crispy.  You won't be sorry!  The jalapeno burger is actually really great.  I don't know where they get their jalapenos, but they are always wonderfully spicy, sometimes EXTREMELY spicy, and always super fresh.  My only disappointing meal here has been the pizza.  I ordered it on a whim one day and was VERY disappointed.  I'm guessing it was an off day, as I've heard others rave about the pizza.  It didn't help that I found a hair on my first slice.  The waitress was very apologetic.  Not only did she comp my meal and offer to have something else made (I'd lost my appetite by then) but she also offered to give me a free meal on a future visit.  I declined the free meal, as I didn't feel it was necessary and knew I'd  be back again, but that went a long way.  This place is pretty small and gets busy during lunch and dinner time, so plan to go early or late.  Enjoy!",

You would think since I'm paying almost $15 for a calzone, they could throw in a ranch for free but they don't. So with the calzone, ranch, and a slice of cheesecake, I paid $23. For one person, that's a bit too much so I don't come here too often. Besides the price, the staff is very nice. The restaurant is always clean.

At first I found him irritating, always asking \"You dining alone?\"  But after frequenting this place for 15 years I am so disappointed if he's not there!  He only asks because they double park the cars dining together to try and make sure everyone gets a space.  For all I know he could be the owner.  I'm like \"Hey!  Where's the You Dining Alone guy?\"  \"Hope he's ok!\"  The food is amazing!  They're kind of Greek but with kick A pizza.  The star of the show is their Greek salad dressing.  They must put something addictive in that stuff.  Don't miss out on that.  I love that u can get a pita or sandwich with the Greek salad as a side among many other options.  Even if u do just get a salad they serve it with hot and fresh pita slices.  (No luck resisting the carbs no matter what because it's all irresistible). The sausage sandwich or the gyro picado salad are my favorites!  I took my boss here for Boss's Day just today.  It's always a special occasion pick but also perfect for every day.  The inside is super small and I'm sure the building is older than I am but WHO CARES!  It's unbelievable and u will not be disappointed regardless of what u order.",

The staff was very polite and attentive. We never had to wait for anything. They had some good choices of beer and the menu wasn't that big to choose from. This made it easy to concentrate on all of the items. Everything was neat and it's place. Thankful, my friend invited me to this place or else I would've been missing out on goodness.  I was wrong! I've never had a salad so good, not to mention the salmon was perfect and juicy. The salad was great and had hint vinegar at the bottom .  My friend had a goat cheese grilled chicken salad and wow! The sauce that glazed the chicken was amazing. It was light, yet sort of creamy. It complimented the bed of salad. I was pressed with the food. Plus, it was cute and very intimate . If I knew about this place earlier, I would probably have tried their whole menu. I'm sure I'll be back sooner than later to try something new. Maybe next time I'll have a beer or two.",

    "text": "I don't recall where I first heard of Crazy Jim's. But when I saw it nearby on Yelp! today, I knew exactly where my girlfriend and I were going to eat lunch.  We enjoy finding out-of-the-way, mom and pop places when eating out. Crazy Jim's has been around for over 30 years and is hidden in plain site on the southeast corner of 15th Avenue and Indian School. Note: It's easier to get to from 15th Avenue and parking is behind the buildings on the corner.  Crazy Jim's is not a huge place. But the staff was extremely friendly and we were seated right away in the front section where it is well lit. It may be tight, but it has a certain charm that makes you forget about the non-descript buildings in the area. And once the food arrives, you will forget you're in Phoenix.  We started our meal, as we typically do at a new restaurant, by sampling the appetizers. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. My girlfriend added an order of Shrimp Scampi. Both are solid choices! The hummus was a generous portion and served with piping hot pita bread. And the scampi was simple and delicious. It was also served with fresh pita bread. Don't forget to soak up the scampi butter sauce with the pita bread!  I've enjoyed some good gyros around town. But the Steak and Feta Gyro I enjoyed today was better than anything I tasted at the last Greek-Fest I attended. The tender steak was cooked perfectly and it melted with the feta cheese, grilled onions and tzatziki sauce. Even though my family isn't Greek, the side of fries reminded me of the homemade fries my mother use to make. This leads me to believe that there is a lot of from-scratch cooking going on in Crazy Jim's tiny kitchen. And when have you ever held pita bread which was too hot to handle?  My girlfriend made a sensible choice by selecting from the very unique \"Not a Salad\" list. It's not a salad because it was made with cabbage. She really enjoyed the grilled chicken which was accompanied by the traditional Greek items (calamata olives, cheese, etc.). Oh, and another serving of their excellent pita bread!  In the end, we were stuffed and had a lot of left overs. Plus, we were very happy that we chose Crazy Jim's over a popular chain that isn't too far from here. We will definitely be back!",

I order a Ham and Pineapple calzone. It wasn't the best I've had but it was still pretty good. My lunch companion ordered a gyro with a side of pasta salad, and I have to say that it looked better than my meal and cost about three dollars less. I tried the salad and the abundance of feta made it taste great.   Other menu items include subs, pasta and salads (with or without lettuce. All the breads and crusts are made fresh daily on site.  My only complaints with this restaurant are that it's very, very small. So small that I noticed a table pushed entirely into the back corner so that only two chairs on the exposed sides could be seated at it. Also, I was quite literally back to back with the gentleman dining at the table behind me. It was also fairly busy (which speaks well for them and their business) and difficult to hear what my friend was attempting to tell me. Oh well, I doubt it was very important anyway...  If I go back to sample the Greek fare, I may be tempted to add a star but until then, this rating is based primarily on my choice of entree.",

If you think paying $7.05 before tax for three small half dried up strips of gyro meat is acceptable, then you might like Crazy Jims. The big chunk of raw onion and the hard pink tomato slice did not make it any more apppetizing.  Now that IS crazy Jim.",

I've tried calamari at many other establishments, but Jim's is by far, the BEST! None of that pre-frozen crap you'll find at your local chain restaurants....the calamari is breaded on site and made to order, and it's simply the best! It's not too breaded and I was told it's pan fried, not dunked in a nasty fryer, like many other places do! Their pita is AWESOME! Its' made on site everyday and it, too, is so addicting! I like to ask the waitress to bring me some honey so I can drizzle it all over my pita, while it's still hot! Everytime I bite into it, I envision that's what rainbows must taste like, because I feel like I've died and gone to heaven! Sometimes I even have them pack me up some pitas to go, so I can take it home and continue to have a fiesta in my mouth! Don't believe me? Try one for yourself...taste the rainbow! This place is great, the staff is super friendly, and the food is fantastic! Please please, Jim, never go out of business, because I'd be lost without you!!",

I've been eating here, without ever any issues for a very long time, but last week while trying to enjoy my lunch, it was super busy, might I add, I was asked by the owner if I drove a particular model of car, because it was double parked behind some other customers who were trying to get back to work. I WITNESSED the owner going from table to table asking everyone if they owned this car to please move it...to no avail. Apparently, she ended up having it towed, because I overheard later on that the occupants that were stuck in front of the double parked were angry that they were going to be late for work..which I could very much understand. The owner was stuck in the middle of it, and had no choice. She absolutely tried in vain to find the rightful owner, I know this, because I had a front row seat to the drama. Anyway, after a long time after...a VERY long time, the two middle aged women that I had noticed the owner approach way earlier, came back in swearing up a storm, accusing the owner of LIES, telling her that she stole their car... thankfully, there was a police officer who happened to be a diner, and made them shut their mouths up pretty quick!I feel bad that I didn't jump in, but after reading the review of the car tow incident, I felt compelled to step forward. PLEASE do not believe these fairy tales of the two angry women.  I was there when they were there and I was there when they left...TWO HOURS later! Seriously, who double parks anyone and dines in a restaurant for over two hours?? Really? Kudos to the owner for handling the situation as best and as classy as she could!The owner is nothing but a hardworking lady. CRAZY JIMS YOU ROCK!! BEST GREEK FOOD IN TOWN!",

When we 1st rolled up to CJ's my girl was like \"I don't know about this!!!\" I said \"lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it\". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasn't too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jim's and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy \"E\" will come to visit.   ps. Our server was great also, friendly, fast and helpful.",

It was almost like Indian fry bread... but not as fried.  Yum.  We had a couple of small pizzas, some hummus, and a side salad.  The prices were reasonable, the service was fantastic, and the food was awesome.   My only complaint about Crazy Jim's would have to be the cramped dining area.  We squeezed in between a couple on a first date and a couple who had clearly been married since time began.  An interesting dichotomy (we are newly married...), but I am one that likes a little private dinner conversation (you know?)  Anyway, I think CJ's would be fantastic for lunch, takeout, or a quick low key dinner.  Go there.  Eat some yummy pita.  Leave full.",

    "text": "I was in the mood to go out for dinner after work instead of going home, and I was getting hungry, so took out my cell, fired up my Yelp app, and scouted for a good local restaurant.  I found one promising tasty Mediterranean fare among other things, less than a mile away, so I made my way over there.  Good thing I didn't \"check in\" before I got to the door--they were closed for \"summer hours\".  Note to newer people in Phoenix--make sure the restaurant you want to go to is open in the evening before beginning the trek!  So I went back to Yelp for another restaurant and now, in the mood for Greek, found another one nearby--practically around the corner.  Crazy Jim's.  Sorry, people.  Despite all the other rave reviews, I can not concur.    I went in and was seated pretty quickly.  The waitress was pleasant and set me up with some water.  I liked the tables with a design and \"Crazy Jim\" carved into them.  The other diners were real casually dressed with t-shirts and shorts--I felt dressed up with my dress shirt from work!    Since other Yelpers didn't rave about the hummus, I didn't order that as an appetizer, as it was also several dollars anyway.  There were two calamari salads, one with or without lettuce.  I went with the \"Crazy Calamari Salad\" with shredded cabbage instead of lettuce to try something different.  The good: the pita.  A nice hot basketful of the slightly charred pita came out, which was great, as many places seem to microwave it and then it gets hard. The not so good: The calamari salad.  I have had a lot of calamari, so I consider myself a pretty good judge of quality calamari.  This was not it.  The calamari was heavily breaded, which may be why it seemed on the greasy side.  The breading wasn't very flavorful, and the calamari could have been a wee bit more tender.  The cabbage was good, the onions plentiful and somewhat sweet.  There was some feta, olives, and pepperoncini, but it was buried under the cabbage and cucumber, so you really had to excavate to find it.  Disclaimer: I'm not a big cucumber fan, so I left a lot of that on my plate.  The oil and vinegar dressing that is on the salad isn't too flavorful--I added some balsamic vinegar that is on the table for extra zip.  Since I really hadn't eaten that much, I had room for dessert.  I inquired about them, and found they don't make their own, but decided to chance it anyway.  The main choices the waitress suggested were a \"capuccino and chocolate mousse cake\" (the menu said tiramisu--was this it?) and baklava.  I decided to try the cake.  A nice moderate-sized piece came out with a blob of white next to it.  The waitress explained that they were trying to serve it with whipped cream, but \"it wouldn't keep its shape, so that kind of ruined the presentation.\"  Uh-huh.  Well, the cake was actually pretty good, but after I finished it, I realized I hadn't noticed much of a coffee taste.  But when I got to the parking lot, I burped, and I tasted it.  And that happened again.  And again.  What?!?!  Did they use coffee flavor or something?    Okay, so the verdict?  I've been to some other Greek places within a 2 mile radius of this place, as well as elsewhere in Greater Phoenix.  Do yourself a favor and try them--better atmosphere and food.  Unless their specialty is chicken, as some other reviewers seem to be saying.",

    "text": "I was just hanging out in Central Phoenix the other day and decided to use my handy dandy Yelp App to find a fun new place to eat. We were wanting to try something new and stumbled across Crazy Jim's.  It's such a small restaurant with the tables pretty close together, so it certainly isn't anything special to look at but the food is really great! After reading some of the reviews we tried the Chicken Feta Salad and the Chicken Feta pita. The Salad was a really good size with all the fixin's and they certainly don't skimp on the Feta! The chicken feta pita was messy to eat but delicious! I don't think I've had enough greek food to have a super dependable opinion of how it's prepared but I really enjoyed it!  The service gets a mixed review: one of our waitresses was very friendly, personal, and really fun to be around. Our other waitress was very even toned and not very engaging so between the two of them the service was good enough.",

    "text": "I can't say I'm in the western avenues a lot, but in the future, whenever I make my way due west, I'll know where to get my Mediterranean fix! Crazy Jim's is hidden on 15th Avenue just south of Indian School. It's unassuming and you could easily drive right past it and never know the difference. But, take my advice and find time to stop in. You won't regret it.   While in between meetings today, Gabi M introduced me to Crazy Jim's and I'm sure glad she did! We were seated by the friendly hostess in the narrow restaurant. Our drinks were brought out within minutes. We started with a side of hummus and pita bread and I opted for the Greek salad with chicken. I was told the dressing on the salad is excellent.   The hummus came out in a bowl and the pita bread was fresh and warm. The hummus didn't have a ton of kick to it, but it still had the creamy hummus taste so it satisfied my chickpea craving. So here is where I shed some light on the concept of a salad from Crazy Jim's. Holy moly salad size! I think they gave me an entire chicken breast on the top of a salad of greens, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese and onions. The salad dressing came on the side and was creamy, delicious and definitely not low-cal (but I don't care)! The meal was hearty but not overly filling. I liked how the salad was hefty enough that I definitely didn't leave hungry for more.   So in summary, there's nothing crazy about Jim's except the fact that they are crazy about their food and getting it right! The next time I find myself on 15th Avenue, I'll know where to go.",

    "text": "I was in a hurry one late afternoon and craving a salad. Luckily, Crazy Jim's was nearby to save me!   Housed in an older building, Crazy Jim's is in a so-so neighborhood, and while I felt comfortable walking from the back parking lot alone, I probably wouldn't do so after dark. It's a small place with wooden tables (carved with Crazy Jim's logo) situated rather close to one another. Luckily I was there late afternoon and didn't need to deal with a large lunch or dinner crowd.   I had the basic Greek salad with home made creamy Greek dressing. I'm often disappointed by salad dressing, but not this time...it was great! The portion size was large enough for an entree, but could suffice for two or more to share as a side. Many restaurants skimp on everything but iceberg, but this salad had several pieces of kalamata olives and the feta was piled high!   The highlight of the meal had to be the pita. Served warm and cut into quarters, it was probably the most flavorful I've ever had! Too bad I didn't ask for extra to go.   My server was fast, friendly and knowledgeable; so helpful with questions I posed about menu items. Speaking of which, since I've sampled so little of it, I'll be back to try the gyro pita and a few others I expect I will love!",

The gyro itself was tender and juicy, and the feta was copious (a little over the top), and the pita....so so good. The pita is really where this place shines. Oh yeah, its not pasta salad if you just give me a thing of penne pasta thats cold. But, good value its like ordering a gyro with a pasta dish. My co-workers really liked their chicken salad, and from the looks of it, they don't go lighthanded with chicken, so great value there.  It's a little weird that the same dish costs $2 less when you take-out versus dine-in....same portion size....  But still Crazy Jim's is decent to good food, good portions, and pretty good price. Good place for lunch.",

However, crazy Jim stands out as a fantastic experience - for my taste buds.  Nothing felt overly salty of gimmicky (corn syrup).  Everything tasted fresh. My calamari was cooked to perfection! So many places overcook calamari, thinking to avoid E. coli or whatever it is that poisons us, but that is mainly a threat from pork or land based meats, not seafood. The side pitas were great too. They melted in my mouth almost. I would come here again in the near future",

Went back tonight and was a tad disappointed in what came with the gyro platter.  Some good places that I've been to put a little medley of things, which it had but was just olives, and those green things that end in cini.  There's a place in Seattle that I have yet to find which compares.  These guys put rice, hummus, feta, olives, tzatziki, and a small greek salad on the side which you can make an awesome wrap with!  And there was more portion for the same price. The meat was good, and everything was good, but I won't order that again.  Seattle's ruined me.  If you are ever in Seattle, you must go to Mr. Gyro's.  I will confidently say that you will not find anyone who makes them better, if so, you got damn lucky!",

The steak sub with feta was great, although I probably would have liked a more substantial roll. Although the salad was fresh and tasty the dressing tasted like plain yogurt with a very scant amount of blue cheese and if there was no seasoning or flavor to it. I pushed what I could of the dressing off of my side and ordered the Caesar dressing and that was excellent. I probably should have ordered the lemon chicken soup instead",

My friends soup and gyro were both cold when she got them. My salad was warm. Usually soup and gyros-warm. Salad-chilled. YA know??? Anyway, we finish eating, I pack my leftovers to go and there was hair on the bottom of my plate. Once I got to the register I let the cashier/waitress know how we felt about our visit and she still charged me and offered an apology she may as well kept. I knew this location wasn't clean but WOW!

Greek dressing - get a side of it no matter what you order.  Add jalapeno to whatever you order, not only are they fresh but its grilled just enough to take the edge off but not so much that its limp.  Adds a pop of flavor to every bite.  Gyro salad. Yes. Cukes & Maters are fresh. Feta is moist. Just a very enjoyable lunch overall.  Nice service. They don't rush you even when there is a line at the door.  I'll Be Back............",

First impression: Crazy Jim's has Crazy Fast delivery!   Then, I bit into the warm, doughy pita bread. Brushed with a bit of oil before grilling, it seems to be homemade, and was absolutely delicious! Second impression: Crazy Jim's has the best pita I've ever tasted...  I moved onto to my chicken feta salad with creamy greek dressing. Chicken = slightly charred, but not too dry, and totally delicious. Feta = abundant and high quality. And then, there's the creamy greek dressing... oh my zeus, it is amazing! Creamy and garlicky and completely drool-worthy. I now crave it frequently! Overall impression: This. Place. Rocks.  We still order in to for the office every once in awhile, but I also frequent the restaurant on my own. I've dined in and ordered takeout, and every time, the food is more than satisfactory. I must admit that I'm hooked on the chicken feta salad, and I have only slightly branched out from there (the goat cheese salad, which was good, but not as good as the chicken salad!), but my other half has eaten their calzones and other items and has always been pleased as well.   We just moved less than half a mile away, so I can see a lot more Crazy Jim's in our future!",
