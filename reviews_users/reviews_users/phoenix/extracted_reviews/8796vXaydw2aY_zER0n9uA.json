I've only ever had a pasty when I've been in the UK...and I may go as far as saying, it's better than what I experienced in Britain.  Modestly priced, great beer, and a large menu selection, including a full vegetarian menu offering the use of Quorn meatless products.  The atmosphere is modern pub with a nice relaxed ambiance.  I love how this spot offers traditional English eats with a culinary twist.  The cottage pie and tikka masala pasty was scrumptious!",

Bartender was pretty attentive. He was good on getting us drinks and taking orders. We started with some wings, which were fine. Not a big wing person, but my friends are, and they liked them. We also had some fries as a starter, which were pretty good. Not extraordinary, but I enjoyed them.  I had the lamb vindaloo pasty, which tasted like a premade Indian flavored dish was stuffed into the pasty and frozen, then baked for me after I ordered. Not great. Chicken Greek pasty was WAY too heavy on the olives, even for my olive loving husband. Did not enjoy that one at all.  Prices for the pasties are a bit high, in my opinion. I don't think I would go back, but I do think the concept of the restaurant is interesting and in cooler weather, the patio would be really nice.",

The bottle and draft selection is always exciting. I have neglected to try anything from the cocktail list yet but that does not mean I am not avoiding it by any means! The food is amazing and alike I'm sure the cocktails are too!   A few favorites: Curried potatoes... amazing The Pilgram... omg your saying i can have thanksgiving whenever I want?? The Lamb Vindaloo... prepare for some heavy breathing from the heat. so. worth. it.  The layout of this place is very comfortable. Along with what I call comfort food the staff and the environment really pulls it together.  A must to visit if your a new resident to PHX, traveling through or you just live here. I promise it wont be your last time back.",

It was a late dinner, so we more or less had the place to ourselves and sat out on the patio with the heater on. I'm not sure if all locations have expanded their menu or if it is just this one, but my friend and I shared the (constitution?) wings and a pasty. The quality was great as expected and our server handled our party great. Would definitely return and recommend",

First of all, they have a fantastic patio, which was a wonderful spot to spend a 70-degree, sunny Sunday.  I couldn't believe how packed the patio was at 3:30, but it was almost full.  There's also ample seating inside, which I will need in the throes of the Arizona summer.  Second, their drinks are relatively inexpensive and strong, and happy hour lasts all day on Sundays.  Third, the pasties are DELICIOUS!  My bf has tried a couple but has stuck with the Reuben because he thinks it's the best.  We ordered a Reuben and a cottage pie (like Shepherd's pie, but with beef and not lamb).  They were both amazing, but the Reuben was definitely my favorite.  The dough was cooked perfectly, the meat was in thick, tasty chunks, and the thousand island was very flavorful.  I usually order apps when I'm out to eat, but there's no way I could have at this place.  The pasties are big!  I barely ate half of each half that I had.  My only complaint is that there are too many different types to choose from!  How will I ever try them all?!  I will definitely be back soon and often, now that I have been introduced to this neighborhood gem :)",

They were really hard wood to sit on.  Our server was OK, but wish she would have had a bit more enthusiasm because the food deserved it!  We ordered 5 things in total.  I had the salmon Pasty my friend had the Pork pasty with apple (not much mint), potatoes and I don't remember what else.  Then I had the greek sale, which was really good, fresh lettuce which was cold and crisp and a great maybe greek dressing.  Half a salad was plenty for lunch.  My friend had a cup of soup with stilton cheese and she said, it too, was yum!  We just had iced tea, pretty color, a little heavy on the water! The reason why I am giving it a 4 star is because of the incredibly loud heavy decibel music which was really annoying if you wanted to have a conversation.  If they could tone that down, i'd give it a 5 start because what we ate for this type of food was delicious, fun idea, and lots of choices! PS, the Salmon pasty was so big, I brought half of it home tonite and now my husband even got to taste this treat!",

I craved it so much had to go back two days later and order it again. I sat at the inside bar, and watched them making different patsy's. There is a lot of work and detail that goes into these things. I need to try some of their other creations, but so far....excellent. The service was very average, and a bit on the slow side. Correct that and it's a True gem.",

    "text": "What in the world is a Pasty, you ask? It's the love child of a calzone and a pie crust. A gourmet hot pocket and a danish. Truly, it's just pretty freaking delicious.  My company had an event here and we sat on the patio. The sky was drizzling, so the staff pulled down the curtains to keep us from getting wet during our meal. The menu is plain unfair because every-single-pasty looks really good. Be prepared to change your mind at the last minute. I asked the waiter what he thought of the Pilgrim (I cheated and looked at Yelp reviews first). He said it was in his top 5, so I acquiesced.   Let me give you the specs on this thing - Roasted turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing. Served with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce. It's basically everything you love about Thanksgiving dinner cooked into a pie.  The pasties come out cut into two parts and I could not stop after the first. It was just too good to not keep going. I think it was the flaky and delicious crust. I really don't know how there could be a bad choice on the menu. We ordered a plethora of desserts as well, which all received rave reviews from the ladies in my office.  I look forward to coming back to check out the expansive bar area and try out another pasty. And, as a Cornish descendant, I highly recommend you support this local Pasty Company!",

Instead of hitting up a place that made me feel like Baymax from Big Hero 6, I constantly hit up In-N-Out and got hungry an hour later. Looking back on my life, I've cheated on tests, got caught cheating on said tests, and have done other things probably not condoned by my neighborhood pastor. But I don't regret any of those decisions. Cornish is different, I regret not going here more.  The parking situation is not ideal, but the food is. Every time I went I got the cheeseburger cornish, and each time I vowed to tell my Super Bowl homies that this would be the place to come for Super Bowl meals. The servings are ginormous. I'm not a big dude, nor do I really wanna be a big dude, but I feel like Taylor Lautner circa New Moon couldn't gobble one of these down even in wolf form.   I've gotta applaud the service too. I've called in beforehand, arrived 10 minutes later than my reservation, and have come during a lunch rush. Each time the food came out in a timely manner.   For a place that transplanted the camp from the Parent Trap to a restaurant in Scottsdale, it is quite impressive. When I come back to Scottsdale, this will be one of the first stops.",

They use quorn ground beef, which is by far my favorite \"fake\" meat on the shelves in the store. The best part about quorn is that they do not use soy. They use mushrooms! It tastes very authentic and finally, FINALLY, you don't have to be that weirdo that orders the only vegetarian menu on the item. You get to indulge in the meat and taters attitude of the rest of your table.   I highly recommend getting the tea with lemon. It is quite different with almost a bread-like taste. The kettle alone makes the tea worthwhile.",

I ordered a lamb with mint pasty, despite the fact that I'm more of a lamb with rosemary, garlic and lemon kind of guy.  The crust was flaky, crunchy and delicious.  To my surprise, the filling was large chunks of slow cooked meat with root vegetables.  I half expected ground lamb and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of ingredients.    This place has a nice atmosphere, a large beverage selection and lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  It's the kind of place where you could spend a few hours, enjoy an inexpensive, but quality meal and toss back a pint or 3.  Just have Uber take you home.",

My family grew up making pasties in the Midwest.  We love eating pasties.  Took my family from the Midwest to the Scottsdale location about a month ago.  12 of us.  Half ordered the oggie.  Took a long time to get our food, which we were fine with.  When the pasties were served, the oggie's were not even close to being done, the potato's were crunchy hard and bruised.  I tried one, super disappointing!  My mom talked to the manager.  She, the manager, made a comment, I told them they needed to stay in the oven longer. What?! Really?!  Very disappointing, considering my family grew up eating pasties and I'm telling them they are as good or better than what we grew up with. Manager credited our bill, that was it. Today, my fiance and I are out and about.  She says, let's go to the pasty co, by our house in old town.  She wanted to get the pilgram and broc cauliflower bake.  OK, we go, sit down outside, no one comes for 10min, my fiance goes in and asks if we can get served w menus?  Waitress apologizes, brings us menus.  Also, she brings a list of everything they are out of.  Broccoli and  cauliflower is on the list of 20 or so things they are out of.  OK, she orders the pilgram and I order lamb n mint.  Waitress comes back, sorry, we are out of the pilgram also.  We decided to go somewhere else to eat.  Sad to say, we may try them one more time down the road, but 3 strikes and they will be out.  What's going on CPC? New management or lack there of?",

    "text": "Attended a wedding rehearsal dinner this past weekend @ Cornish Pasty Company and was very impressed.  Prior to receiving the invite I'd never heard of a pasty before - and apparently wasn't pronouncing it right either.  But I soon learned that what you have here is essentially the British version of a calzone - all the goodies are stuffed inside a pastry & baked.    Cornish Pasty Company truly offers something for everyone - the options for your pasty range from traditional pub fare to indian, jewish deli, seafood & more.  And what they do here they do oh so right - my shepherd's pie pasty was truly remarkable, as were the reuben my dad had & the \"pilgrim\" (think thanksgiving dinner) my wife ordered.  Others at the table also enjoyed the options they went for.  Believe it or not they even have dessert pasties - wifey & I share the caramel apple one, and I had the opportunity to taste the chocolate bread pudding as well, both were really impressive.  As if this weren't enough, they have a phenomenal selection of beers including some nice local selections and all of this is being served up by some super friendly staff in a very casual & fun atmosphere.    My only complaint? Now I have to go back home to NY and find someplace that makes these because I know I'll be craving one very soon.",

Nice, not-too-dark but could be romantic lighting. And you can watch them prepare your food which is kinda cool. They had wings, which were not the stars here but we were forgiving because the pasty's (PASS-TEES) were something everyone needs to try.   A pasty is a baked pastry, a traditional variety of which is particularly associated with Cornwall, the westernmost county in England. It is made by placing uncooked filling typically of meat and vegetables, on a flat pastry circle and folding it to wrap the filling, crimping the edge to form a seal. After baking, the result is a raised semicircular food item.  Kind of like a super pot pie with great choices of fillings. The Oggie (Meat and potatoes) and Reuben were faves. The Italian was so-so, but who would think crossing Britain with Italy would work out?  Skip the wings, go for the prime objective, and follow it up with the chocolate cake which is semi-lava hot and crispy. Need I say more? Great date spot. We saw a lot of that. Service great, clean, several locales. Oh, and did I say beer?",

I know, it was gravy-esque and gravy is supposed to be salty. But I did not enjoy the sauce on the side, while I felt like it was more of a mushroom pastry than anything. Not peppered steak.  Chicken & Pesto filling - Pesto, chicken and cheese. It was A-OK with marinara sauce on the side.  We also got the Scotch Egg appetizer, which was not bad, but I wish there was more flavor in the batter of the egg. And I felt like egg was just an overcooked hardboiled egg.  You know that old stereotype about how bad British food is? Uhhh. ha ha ha.. uhh...",

    "text": "I really love this place, it's hard to know where to start in describing exactly why. The original location is super cool, but this spot takes the cake. Not to mention Old Town badly needs a laid-back hideout for those of us that don't jive comfortable with the normal Scottsdale crowds in the area (i.e. bros and blue hairs). They've done a phenomenal job turning this into a slightly hipster but not at all pretentious hangout. They even let me host a co-ed \"baby shower\" there without judging - and our waiter ROCKED.  First of all, the patio is fabulous when the weather is nice. They have misters of course for hotter days, and it's dog friendly. The inside has a super cool vibe with amazing wall paper and pictures of coal miners for a cool vintage touch (read the backstory re: pasties). The food is consistently excellent and extremely filling - an excellent reminder to keep up my fitness habit. The meatless menu is huge, though I always order the same thing (mmmm vegan Chicken Tikka Masala). I devoured their fries for the first time last weekend, they were spicy and delicious. The only thing I haven't completely demolished was the Strawberry Pavlova. There was nothing wrong with it at all, it just wasn't chocolate covered in more chocolate so... not really my thing. But fruit lovers would probably really like it. The beer selection is awesome with great local options, and while I haven't tried the cocktails, I've heard good things about those too.  Come here for dinner or just a drink, enjoy the patio or escape the heat inside at the bar - there's not a bad time to visit. This will definitely be on the regular rotation for the foreseeable future!",

    "text": "I want to preface this by saying that we LOVE Cornish Pasty, as a general rule. We usually go there every Sunday for a pasty and a beer and our favorite dessert, banoffee pie. We ordered take-out tonight which included our beloved banoffee pie, and when I removed it from the bag, I discovered a frozen-over mess of what was once, I'm sure, a lovely and intensely satisfying dessert. Normally the whole caramel-whipped cream-banana situation is perfectly fresh- ESPECIALLY the bananas, but this looked like it had been in the freezer for a week before they gave it to us. The bananas were brown and squishy and the whipped cream had turned yellow and was frozen solid throughout the middle. You guys should know better than to expect a dessert with those ingredients to be served any other way than fresh- you do everything else so well! I've never had it not fresh when I was in the restaurant- so this was a huge let down when I brought that rock-solid icy mass of bitter disappointment back for my hubby's birthday dessert! No frozen banoffee pie for anyone from now on, can I get an amen?!! And a replacement on my next visit, perhaps? (Kidding... Sort of.) Had to knock a star off an otherwise favorite local restaurant. If I had wanted a frozen dessert, I would have hit up Fry's for a Sara Lee's (which, sadly, would have been an upgrade from this).  UPDATE 2/28/15: You have been redeemed :) Thank you for taking care of us and serving up the usual delicious fare and the best, freshest banoffee pie we have had yet! It's back on top of our list of favorite desserts in town. See you next time :)  P.s. I wish we had taken a picture of the banoffee pie we got on our return visit because it not only tasted amazing, but looked equally amazing as well. We dove right in before we even thought to snap an updated photo for this review!  P.p.s. Crap, now I'm craving banoffee pie...",

Here is the thing, I found out that a Pasty is just like a huge Empanada. If I would have known this, I would have definitely tried the restaurant sooner.   The wrap or crust was super flaky and excellently prepared. She had the Shepherds Pie Pasty and I had the Lamb and Mint Pasty. The fillings were super tasty and the wine reduction sauce was exactly what it needed. For dessert, we had the Banofee Pie. The caramel was made in-house and reminded me of good dulce de leche that I have eaten in the past. We would have given the place five stars but the meatball appetizer was crazily over-salted.   All in all we had a really nice time. Other incidentals, the servers were very friendly and informative and there is bench seating on the inside as well as a large patio seating area outside. It was not super busy when we went, but I can definitely see the place getting packed on a Saturday night. So, plan ahead.",

First, the place looks nice, comfortable seating however it is not. We arrived and it wasn't busy at all. We wandered in and weren't greeted, had to ask about seating. Service was mediocre at best. It took ages. The food was disappointing. We ordered a Rosemary Chicken, Cheese and Onion, Veggie Pesto Chicken and Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese.  Yes, the pasties are large and should be satisfying, they weren't. The Rosemary Chicken pasty was stuffed with slices of potato. My friend had to take them all out because they weren't cooked. They were hard. The waitress asked why she didn't eat the potatoes, she explained and said she could have taken it back and put it back in the oven. We could have, had she ever checked on us. The Cheese and Onion pasty was OK but unevenly cooked. The Veggie Pesto Chicken had little flavor. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Cheese were lumpy, with bits of uncooked potato, a faint smell of garlic but not even a hint of garlic flavor.    The good, place looks nice and the prices are great. The bad, mediocre service, uncomfortable seating -hard benches- and food is average at best.",

Beer selection is pretty good and not ridiculously priced. The entire restaurant is very clean, inside and out. Outdoor seating area is dog friendly, which is a huge plus for us.",

    "text": "Sometimes you just get a hankering for pub food that's hearty and sticks to your ribs. Came in for lunch with the bf before shopping and he was a fan of the Tempe location.   The place was almost entirely empty, but lovely looking. Not as dark nor dingy as Tempe's location. We started off with a Scotch Egg to share and got each ordered a pasty. I wanted to go with a simple cottage pie and the bf got the Guinness Beef Stew.   The Scotch Egg is definitely on the small side, it being one hard boiled egg encased in a seasoned sausage meat and deep fried. It was served with dipping sauce on the side. Pretty good flavor and tasted good with the honey mustard sauce.   My Cottage Pie pasty was definitely filling, I always love the crust here! It's flakey, soft but substantial enough to hold the contents in. Typical ingredients of ground beef, mashed potatoes, carrots and served along with a red wine reduction type sauce.   The Guinness Beef Stew was good, tender pieces of beef and you can really taste the Guinness. The sour cream and chive sauce served along with it freshened up the richness of the pasty and provided a good contrast of cool cream to hot stew filling. The only con was there wasn't much depth or complexity to this filling, it tasted mostly of Guinness leaving me wanting to taste the flavors of herbs that had stewed along with the meat.  Service was great, we were checked up on frequently and food came out promptly. Location is nice with a small parking lot and is easily accessible. The place wasn't too dim and wasn't too noisy as it was practically empty.",

    "text": "I wish I could leave this place 0 stars.  Or negative stars for that matter. March 9, 2018: one of the worst experiences I've ever had in Old Town Scottsdale.   I arrived at Cornish to have dinner with my best friend Dan.  Everything was going great. We sat down at the bar, ordered our respective entrees, and proceeded to what we thought would be a great night. We ordered Irish car bombs, Moscow mules, and Jack and diets.  We were having a great time.  About one hour after we arrived, four friends of ours arrived.  They sat down next to us and ordered drinks. After they ordered, we decided we should move to a table that coule accommodate our party. We asked our server for our tab.  She gave us a table with all of the items on one check.  Not an issue, but since we all arrived at different times, we asked the server if she could split the check.  She replied: \"I don't have time for that.\" We were surprised.  We asked again, but were ignored.  We decided we needed to take things into our own hands and had our friend split the check.  After our friend finished splitting the check and calculating Arizona sales tax, we then left the check at the counter with our credit cards so we could pay. The server then slammed the bill with our cards in front of us and then had the other server hand it to us. She apparently thought that our request to split the check wasn't adequate. Again, we weren't being rude.  We just had different parties come at different times.  And offered to split ourselves.  We closed out, sat down at the nearby table and finished our night. We were so disgusted with the service experience that we decided to leave.   As we were leaving, my good friend looked at one of the employees and said \"have a good night\", to which she replied with no words, only a body spasm and a look of disgust with a cold shoulder. I wish that the employees at Cornish party had more time to add up checks and be friendly like all other restaurant we go to. Step up your game Cornish pasty!",

Hearing that the owner was from Cornwall, England and having been there myself several times, I was anxious to go. I haven't had a good Pasty in years and my quest now continues. The dough itself was as it should be, flaky and cooked to  perfection however, there wasn't enough meat or filling other than potatoes. The gravy was also good but again, when the pasty alone is nothing but a pocket for potatoes, there isn't much else you can do. On a positive note, the guy behind the bar preparing them was very friendly and informative and gave us some great information about Scottsdale and the surrounding areas.",

It just really hit the spot after a long drive from LA.   Beans, poached egg, bacon, potatoes and baked tomatoes fill a flakey, lightly salted crust. I ordered it with ranch and their magical chipotle sauce. I love just how many sauces Cornish has. Truly a beautiful thing.   I've very much missed this spot  please open an LA location !!!!!",

The Scottsdale location is nice and big and although I was here for lunch I would love to go back in the evening and try a few of the beers on the menu. The patio is very comfortable with misters to keep it cool and the interior looks great with lots of seating for both large and small groups.

While my typical spot is the Old Town location, I have also been to the one in Tempe and the food is consistent.  As for the menu, the primary items are all pasties. They are similar to pot pies and have a nice golden crust and each comes with a dipping sauce. My favorite is the Lovely bit of Salmon, which is a healthier option on the menu and has asparagus inside and comes with a dill dipping sauce. The spicy BBQ turkey is also very good. Finally, try pairing your pasty with the lemonade drink from the bar. With fresh muddled strawberries, you can't go wrong!  Bottom line:  This place has great food, a a tasty drink on the menu, and has discounted partially cooked menu items that can be taken home to enjoy at your own dinner table.",

When potatoes are your favorite food (like they are mine) and you could eat soup even when it's 115 degrees out (like I do), there's no better place than Cornish. Oh, did I mention it's a dream for vegetarians? Seriously, you'll be impressed with the number of options they have.   This is good, hearty food that hits the spot. My go-to meal can be any variation of the eggplant parm pasty, the cream of leek, potato, and stilton soup, or the Greek pasty. Great for splitting as the portions are huge. Particularly on a chilly, Arizona winter night, I love grabbing a bench, sipping on a pint, and wishing I was half as cool as the hipster staff here.  Five stars: all day, err day.",

    "text": "I have been in love with Cornish Pasty Co. since they opened in Tempe in 2005. Since then, they've opened a location in Mesa and now a location in Scottsdale. I have been waiting for a Scottsdale location for years and my wish was finally granted!   My husband and I have been here twice since they've opened. The first time we came for dinner. We found parking easily, but I can see how the parking lot could fill up fast. There is no hostess station, it's more of a seat yourself establishment. If you catch a waiter's eye, they'll tell you to sit wherever you wish. I'm totally cool with this. Luckily, there is a lot of seating - both inside and out. We chose to sit outside, so we could enjoy the patio. The patio is large with an awesome bar, a square table fitted around a tree, and large liquor barrels stationed about (for decoration/tables). Our waitress was quick to stop by for drink orders. When she brought us waters, we were ready to order food. The Scottsdale location has some new appetizers that the Tempe location doesn't, so we decided to try something new the Parliament Wings. My husband ordered the lamb and mint pasty and I ordered a bowl of soup - my favorite being the cream of leak with potato and Stilton. Our wings were quick to arrive and were tasty. Not the best wings I've ever had, but still good. The soup and pasty arrived as we were just finishing up the wings. They were delicious and tasted just how we expected. (I would highly recommend the soup - especially if you like Stilton or any blue cheese. It is tangy and smooth. It also comes with some house made bread which is scrumptious.) It was a very good meal and definitely lived up to the high expectations we had.   Our second visit was for lunch. We decided to try the Cornish Meatballs (another new appetizer) and ordered a pasty to split. The meatballs were different but good. The meatballs are wrapped in bacon and come in a small cauldron like pot which has croutons, sauteed onions, and a tangy mustard-like sauce. Again, our pasty was delicious. (I love their crust; the little braid on top is my fav.)   Overall, I would say this is a great success and I will definitely be back. I am super excited to finally have a Scottsdale location so I can now get my pasty fix whenever I want!",

My pasta salad was huge, flavors were on point, nice fresh ingredients! My friend had the Greek pasty that she let me try...Delish! Service was excellent!

My friends used to tell me about going to the Tempe location all the time & how much they LOVED the pasties.  I mean, the restaurant itself is really nice. I liked the set-up/atmosphere. It has a \"clean\" pub feel to it if that makes any sense. I really like the wood tables. The patio is really nice (that's where my and my dining companion sat for lunch). The bar area looked really nice as well, and from what I can tell they had several beers on tap. Service was fine on our visit.   The pasties were definitely tasty. I had the Italian, and I guess when you're eating something that's similar to a calzone anyway you look at it, and you get the one that's MOST similar to a calzone it's a little difficult to get a sense of how unique pasties really are. They have several interesting options, many of which I'd really like to try in the future. My dining companion and I also split an order of fries. I thought they were good, but a little crispy. I like my fries on the crispy side, but a good portion of them were almost a little TOO crispy. We couldn't tell if that's why they were going for or not.  My friend really liked her hibiscus ice tea. She's been here a few times and said all their ice teas are really good.    I'd certainly come back to Cornish Pasty Co., and it seems like a fun place for a large group to grab a meal. Like I said though, I guess I'm just not totally enamored by pasties (but they are good).",

It was my first time here so I got the Oggie as many people has suggested on Yelp. The crust wasn't as flaky as I had imagined and was almost a bit doughy on the part where they pinch the pasty together. Meat and potato filling was slightly bland, so definitely the wine sauce helped resolve that issue. I actually would have liked more of the sauce. Also got the try the apple pasty and banana desserts. I really enjoyed the graham cracker crust on the banana dessert! Very delicious!",

Our neighbor is actually from Cornwall and he was the one who brought us here to try the regional specialty of his home turf.  Obviously, he is a regular here.    Now I had been to the Cornish Pasty location in Tempe, but it had been a few years ago, so for all intents and purposes this was my first real, sit-down visit.    They let us sit where we wanted and we chose a nice spot out on the patio and they brought us a high chair and drink.  I got a glass of the house Riesling.  (It was delicious) and our waitress brought a small pewter plate of bread slices and a small dipping cup of tomato soup for our daughter.  I thought that was really thoughtful of her.  We ordered a side of chips with a spicy bean dip for the table, and everyone enjoyed that.  I also got to taste the cup of soup that Trystan ordered, a creamy potato, leek and Stilton cheese combination.  Honestly I wished I'd ordered a whole bowl of that soup for myself!  Amazing.  I ordered the Oggie pasty and it was a thing of beauty, deliciously browned and filled with a hearty, meat and root vegetable mixture.  It came with a flavorful sauce that I *think* was a red wine reduction.  My husband got the Cottage Pie and he said he really liked it.  And apparently it was hefty enough that he had enough leftovers to take for lunch today.    By the end of dinner we didn't have any room for dessert, which means we will just have to make an effort to come back and try their delicious sounding desserts; like sticky English toffee pudding!  Keep it up guys, I really liked what I saw last night; the food, service, ambiance, everything.  Spot on!",

I have tried several of the pasties but my favorites are the more traditional ones, especially the chicken pot pie pasty - just a perfect, flaky crust and rich, saucy fillings that warm you to the core.   Speaking of warming you to the core, get yourself a cup of the leek soup - it's so underrated and you won't even believe it. Spread some butter on the house made bread, dip it in the soup and you've got yourself a little piece of heaven.   Always great British beers and ales on tap too - one of my favorite restaurants to bring visitors to in the valley.",

We headed out here after discovering the place we attempted to go to dinner closed at 4 p.m. on Sundays, so since this was only a mile away from where we were and had been on both our bookmark lists for some time, it was meant to be!  The ambiance at this location is great. It has a very laid back feel and plenty of seating in break off rooms throughout. it is a seat yourself place and picking which seat you want can be a challenge with all the great options - inside at the bar to watch all the action, outside with the misters and bar feel, or in one of the knooks with a more private feel??  We love to sit at the bar and watch people work, so we took some front row seats and were greeted by our waitress. She took our drink orders and we opted to get the Bangers and Mash and the Porky and both eat half so we get two different flavors each! They were both excellent, but my personal fave was the Bangers cause it was just stuffed with filling and the mashed potatoes were perfect.  At the end we opted to split an Apple dessert pasty with ice cream, and it was just as delectable as it sounds! The staff were all friendly and watching them work was fascinating / hypnotic.   Overall: A+ Dinner and a show if you sit at the bar and watch them work their magic!",

If you aren't one of those people, this place is for you. Don't come here and order a salad. That is just sad.   Now for my favorites: The Pilgrim and the Lovely Bit O' Salmon. I have ventured out of the box and tried others, but I always come back to these. They are perfect.   P.S. If you've never had the pleasure of a Scottish Egg, for the love of god, what are you waiting for?",

    "text": "P-ay-stee, P-ah-stee, or P-aaaa-stee, however you say pasty- it is good stuff.  When I went here with a large group of work friends, we found many interesting ways to say \"pasty\" and after the beers started  flowing even more ha!  If you are very hungry this is the place to go!  A pasty is similar to a calzone or an empanada but with a thin-ish pastry dough as opposed to a bread/pizza dough around the outside.  You can fill it up with any kind of yumminess you would like and the menu is full of delicious options.    The drink menu is decent with a good selection of beers and I am a fan of their house cocktails considering 3 out of 4 of them have gin :)  The service can be slow, but they are generally nice and informative.  The patio is great for groups with bench style seating and picnic tables.  Two historic homes make up the building and  inside there is a view of the kitchen and the staff usually waves hi, which is very pleasant and inviting!",

The pilgram was turkey, sweet potatoes, stuffing and sage. Served with cranberry sauce. Loved it! We topped in off with banoffee pie! Omg.. best dessert ever.

This is the sort of place that makes its vegetarian food taste so good that it doesn't need to be super heavy to compensate for missing meat.  If you're sad that you haven't eaten shephard's pie since you gave up meat, mosey on over!   The vegetarian cottage pie is generous, hearty and flavorful - makes you forget you're not eating meat!  We've tried the lovely bit o'salmon and three different vegetarian pasties.  The pasty shell itself is really nice - flaky and yummy but not in a heavy, thunk in the stomach sort of way.  Each pasty choice has been burtsing with flavor.  The salmon is light and flavorful and the combination with the aparagus is just lovely - and the dill cream sauce has a wonderful light tang.  The portobella mushroom has beautiful vegetables and melty cheese, perfect with marinara.  The vegetarian chicken and rosemary is not too dry, and spiced well with nice texture but then the mustard cream sauce hits it out of the park.     The place itself is lovely.  There are tons of seating choices - inside and out, wrap-around bar, big and small tables - it's large but interesting.  The decor is rich and dark with lots of refrences to mining (read all about the origins of the pasty on the menu), and the service is attentive and informed.    After multiple excellent visits, this place is definitely 5 stars!",

There is a dedicated parking lot but has limited spaces but there is nearby street parking close to the restaurant. Despite being on Goldwater the signage isn't very noticeable so it can be a little hard to find. I didn't immediately see the restaurant but luckily turned into the closest side street for parking.  We stepped in for dinner around 7-7:30 on a weekday and there were plenty of seats to choose from both inside and outside. We sat on the patio and enjoyed our delicious pasties. I had the salmon pasty which had tender flaky fish, spinach, and potato with a lovely white wine sauce that went well with it. The buttery crust was excellent. I tried a bit of the Reuben as well which had well seasoned, tender corned beef, sauerkraut, with a small container of Thousand Island dressing to go with it.  Service was good. Our server was friendly and attentive.  I'll be back if I'm craving a delicious pasty next time I'm in the area!  4.5/5",

    "text": "Cornish Pasty Company was a great late night dinner option in Old Town because we lost track of time and didn't each much at all throughout the night. Open until midnight and with the kitchen taking their last order around 11:40, we made it just in time to grab a couple of pasties. I slept like a baby that night after eating the baked pastry that definitely hit the spot.  This location is large with both indoor seating, outdoor seating, and large communal tables. If you don't get a chance to look over the menu before you arrive, the choices for pasties are limitless and can be overwhelming. We didn't know what to get so we just asked the server and she suggested the chicken pesto and Guinness stew pasties. She didn't steer us wrong with the selections or service. Although I could have eaten anything at that moment, everything inside the flaky crust was delicious and tasted fresh. Two pasties was more than enough for two diners and the St. Archer coffee cream porter was a great paring for the pasties.  I wish we could have sampled more, but that was just bad time management of the night on our part. Depending on what you get, a pasty will run you an affordable $10-$11. There are also soups, salads, and sides on the menu. They have a full bar and the beer list isn't extensive but is rotating with a nice variety. It'll probably be a while before I'm back at this location, but there's no doubt I'll visit the Vegas location to try even more.",

And boy, were we in for a treat! The restaurant is cute, very quaint, and has that traditional pub feel. No TVs were anywhere to be seen which was wonderful! We were finally encouraged to actually sit and talk to each other and really enjoy our time together as a family. Now to the menu. There is an extensive range of pasty options, from a thanksgiving pasty to a traditional beef stew-like filling, and even vegetarian and vegan pasty fillings! Guaranteed, there is something for everyone! We ordered the bangers and mash pasty, the oggie (traditional beef pasty), the chicken pot pie pasty, and the pilgrim (thanksgiving dinner pasty), as well as an order of the Parliament wings. We arrived around 6 and they had sold out of four or five of the most popular pasty flavors, so if you want to try the Lamb Vindaloo, Peppered Steak, or some of the other ones that are popular according to many other yelp reviews, arrive early so you can guarantee they haven't sold out! The dough that they use to wrap the pasty was so delicious and flaky, and every pasty that we ordered was incredible! Large portions and absolutely stuffed to the brim with flavor! The Parliament wings had a wonderful sticky sweet and spicy sauce, I could have eaten an entire order more of them! Service was fairly good, our food came out in a timely fashion, and for such a reasonable price, we left very happy and full. I will definitely be back to try even more flavors of pasty!",

That's right world.  So, as we walked up I already sensed the impending disaster as my friends wife had to correct the way Pasty was spelled to Pastie. Now I knew I was gonna hear it.

I felt instantly sorry for them as a now dreaded the English culinary snobs.   She ordered the Oggie which is the Traditional pasty, he ordered the steak and Stilton and I your humble write ordered the Roast Beef dinner.

You had the option to sit outside or inside. The first time we went we sat inside by the bar and the other time we sat outside on the white picnic type benches. I really enjoy the Cottage Pie and have gotten in twice now because I enjoy it so much. My boyfriend really likes the Chicken Pesto. The service was definitely slower outside than it was inside but then again it's a popular place. I sat on the bench connected to the outside wall and there was little black bugs all on the seat. They got better over time and I kinda got over it realizing we were outside. Every time we go the drinks are always great and the bartender is always on point!",

The service is awful, tonight we were there for dinner... only stayed for drinks our experience was so awful. The music was basically head bangers ball. When I asked the manager if possibly they could put on something less angry his reply \" umm didn't you notice the music isn't even on right now.\" So rude. He wouldn't even turn around and look at me. We will not be returning, such shame we probably ate there once or twice a month. There are too many places in Scottsdale where the servers and managers actually want your patronage.  I do want to update my review... the manager that was rude did reach out to me in a very professional email.  However I have to reiterate that your initial reaction was beyond rude and that type of music in a pub is not professional or enjoyable for the vast majority of people.",

Horseradish sauce was available, but they didn't offer it and I didn't think to ask until it was almost gone.   I mean, hey it's not a regular menu item and this was my first time in the place. I'm not gonna cry, I did clean the plate and it was getting busy. The Guinness & Jameson was cold & wet as expected and did the job.  I got there early and avoided all the riff-raff. I'll be back to try out a few other items and I wouldn't be surprised if they earn another star. The actual restaurant/bar is pretty dope, nice atmosphere, plenty of seating with nice folks.",

I ordered the Meat and Cheese Pasty, with the mustard cream sauce and a water, which came to $10.80 plus tip. It arrived in 10 minutes. My server was pleasant and efficient.   The crust of the Pasty was buttery and flaky enough to remain light yet sturdy enough to avoid leakage. The filling, (meat, cheese, onions and gravy), had ample meat and cheese. The beef was cut into 1/2\" pieces, making it manageable. It was cooked in a hearty sauce but the mustard cream sauce put it over the top. BTW, there is no wrong way to eat one: pasties were one of the original hand-helds.   For a filling, yummy, carb-loaded meal that sticks to your ribs, try The Cornish Pasty Co.",

I got the Carne Adovada and my mom got the Cottage Pie (Shepard's Pie but with beef instead of lamb). They were both very good, although I thought mine was a bit more unique; her's tasted like the shepard's pie I make at home.   They par-bake each pasty to make the wait time shorter when you order it, which I definitely appreciate, but I dislike both swiss and bleu cheese that took a ton of the really good sounding options off the table instantly.  Each pasty ranges $10-15 dollars, and does not come with any sides but I couldn't even finish a whole one so I still think a pretty good value.   This location has a very cool indoor/outdoor bar that I would love to come back and try.",

Though I adore English/Irish/Scottish beers (i.e., Boddingtons, Guiness, Harp), I have always dreaded going to a pub hungry because the food is usually uninspired. But Cornish Pastry Co. shows that the UK can deliver some good food too.   I started with the red pepper soup, which was phenomenal. It came with some house-made bread and great soft butter. I could have easily just eaten bowls of the soup and an entire loaf of the bread. Pasties are kind of like a pot-pie mixed with a hot pocket, but far more high quality. The dough was a bit thick for my liking, but I'm not a big pot pie person, so if you enjoy savory pies, I'm sure you'll love it more than I did. The only complaint - it will take a very long time for them to special order any of the pasties (i.e., I don't like melted cheese, and almost all the pasties come with it). So you will want to check out the menu online first to make sure there are a few options you like. I went with a salmon-based pastie that had a nice dill sauce instead of cheese.   The location is nice, with a gorgeous outside bar. But it is hard to find (I walked around for about 5 minutes through the labyrinth of nearby restaurants and cafes before finding it). Also, VERY minimal parking. They name mixed drinks after Star Wars characters, which is a nice touch. The bartender was friendly, but not too terribly attentive.",

After waiting half an hour, we flagged down our server and told him we needed to get to a meeting so wanted to know when our meal would be out. He said that the pasty took a bit longer - 20 minutes. (Note we'd already waited 30 minutes.) Twenty minutes later his excuse was that they were making sure the tomato soup was gluten friendly. The menu said it usually comes with croutons but could be ordered GF. Wonder what was so difficult about not putting croutons on the soup. His third excuse was that the kitchen was busy. He did not apologize for the long wait, only gave stupid excuses.   The food might have been good if we hadn't had to wolf it down in order to get to our meeting on time. The menu is extensive and the outdoor patio looks inviting. Too bad they don't have people who know how to serve customers.",

The patio is also surrounded by misting machines that go just enough to keep the air cool but not enough to be bothersome.  The menu is full with regular pasties and premium pasties in addition to salads. They also have a good drink and beer menu. Sides are separate and not included with the entrees so plan on paying extra for them; they are big enough to split, however, especially considering how large the pasties are.  We ordered the Rosemary Chicken and The Pilgrim pasties and were delighted with our meals. The Rosemary Chicken was moist and well seasoned and paired well with the mustard cream sauce. Likewise, The Pilgrim was superb and reminded us of a thoughtful Thanksgiving dinner paired with a red wine gravy that added a touch of tartness. The garlic cheese mashed potatoes were tasty and coated in baked cheese.  The food came In huge portions and tasted authentic. The outdoor seating is quiet during the day with good, chill music. Its simply an awesome menu with top-notch execution nestled in a little slice of Britain. If we lived here, this would be a weekly spot for us.",

Wonderful flavor and texture. The meat was all just perfect. The pasty was cooked to perfection. None of us cared for the pesto chicken though.

Our sub-party of three decided to order two Pasties and split them.  We got The Royal with Cheese (kind of a souped-up burger, Pasty-style) and The Mexican.  I was slightly deceived about the level of heat in The Mexican, so my fellow spice wimps out there may want to beware.  I wish I could take the jalepenos though, because the flavor was great.

The Vegan Florentine Pasty combined the delicate flavor of fresh herbs and vegan cheese with the meatier textures of potatoes and other rich vegetables, and I was hooked.  Why else do I go?   The OVEN CHIPS.  They are delectable potato fries dipped and fried in fresh garlic or jalapeno as you please, and they are yummy.    Other reasons:  The menu is startlingly huge, with pasties that capture flavors from around the world to satisfy many palates, from spicy Indian flavors to traditional American to Asian influences.  There are probably at least 40 pasties on the menu, so you're bound to find one you like, including at least 10 vegetarian pasties and a rotating menu of vegan pasties.  Finally, this is a British-style Pub, and so if you want to enjoy traditional British brews while people-watching on a wrap-around patio in Old Town Scottsdale, this is a great place for you.   Final Notes:  Some of the tables are community-style, and so you may be seated at a long picnic table rubbing elbows with another jolly group of people (wasn't a problem for us).  Come hungry.",

For such a large group the service was very good. Parking turned out to be easy as there was space in the lot and on the streets.",

This place refurbished two old houses/modular homes or something and we all watched it go up thinking \"what in the world is this joint going to be?\".   Well, the patio is huge.  It contains a huge booth area around a tree, large seating areas outside (now with heat lamps, so hopefully misters in the hot months), an indoor/outdoor bar.  Great music outside as well.   In addition, the food is great.  I have had the read deal with pasties, and I didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised.  I opted for the lamb and mint pasty because I'm a lamb fiend.  It was divine.  inside the pasty was lamb, mint, rutabagas, potatoes and a side of red wine sauce.  So rich and filling.    Everyone at my table also got a pasty and loved it. One of my friends got a vegetarian option and wasn't that thrilled, but honestly, vegetarian anything usually is only half decent.   the prices are reasonable, the pasties are large and the atmosphere is laid back. Great addition!",

You can seat yourself wherever you want and they have plenty of indoor, outdoor, and bar seating. Sometimes it gets very crowded, but it never gets too loud.  The pasties are amazing. The crust is flaky and delicious and they have so many different options for fillings! They also have LOTS of vegetarian options which is a huge plus. The Veggie Oggie is one of the best that I've had - potatoes, mushroom, rutabaga and onions. Last time I was there I decided to try their soup (cream of potato and leek) and I was not disappointed!  As far as drinks are concerned, I'm not a big beer person, but they have a fairly good selection of ciders and signature cocktails.   Overall, I love going here and would highly recommend it.",

    "text": "If you are vegan and you love pot pie you have to try this place! I haven't had pasties before, but finding out that they have vegan options peaked my curiosity.  Their menu says Vegetarian and Vegan options, but the vegan options are actually not listed - you have to ask your server what the vegan specials are. There are usually 2 every night, but there was only 1 the night we went - the Greek. It came with a side of tahini sauce. With and without the tahini it was oozing with flavor and vegan cheeze and vegetables once I cut it open. The crust was easy to cut with a fork and reminded me of pie. Maybe you've had pasties before and you know what I'm talking about (lucky). For those who haven't had a pasty before, it's kind of like a fancy hot pocket and about 2-3 times the size, but tastes more like a delicious homemade pot pie straight out of the oven. They are filling. I could barely finish mine, but I had some help. The oven potatoes and red potatoes are also (or can be made) vegan - confirm with your server since it doesn't say so on the menu! We ordered the oven fries with garlic. We had to get a second order because they were popular at our table.   They do custom vegan pasties, made with the available ingredients on the menu, but you have to call and order them about an hour in advance - it takes time to make the perfect food (or second perfect food depending on where you rank burritos).  If you're feeling social, they have a couple of long community tables and a good beer selection (and I think a full bar too). Great place to meet friends for dinner. Looking forward to my next pasty!",

    "text": "As a carb lover, anything wrapped in a pastry is pretty exciting for me. Cornish Pasty serves mainly pasties and they have a few dozen different fillings and dipping sauces to choose from.   The first time I ever ate here, I ordered the eggplant parmesan pasty. Because I loooove eggplant Parmesan any other time. But in pasty form, not so great. Plus they put broccoli in it. But I still saw the potential there. I also tried a bite of my friend's Cajun chicken pasty, which comes with a really awesome spicy sauce, and I liked it. So I figured I just ordered the wrong pasty for me. I came back a second time and ordered the bangers and mash pasty--much better! I think pasties were originally intended to be a meat and potatoes thing, and I think it's best to stick to that.  I gave it 3 stars because the service both times I've been there has been sub par. The waitresses always seem to forget about our table for long stretches of time. They also don't allow you to modify anything in a pasty. I believe this is because they ship them over frozen and are just heated up. Naturally, I would give them more brownie points for making the pasties fresh on site.",

That's right, I was tasting Thanksgiving dinner all wrapped up in a golden crust.   The interior of the restaurant definitely has that British pub feel and look, and the long communal tables are trendy and at the same time, reminiscent of the old days.

I arrived a little early so I ordered a Four Peaks Peach Ale so enjoy while waiting. Also cruised the menu too, so many to choose from, how does one make the right choice when trying them for the 1st time.  When it came time to order I went with something that was new to the menu, it was a spicy bbq chicken pasty with a side of slaw. I guess the best way to describe a pasty would be like a grown up hot pocket. Because everything is made fresh in the morning, there is no substituting anything, so order what you know you will like.  My pasty was the bomb! I had been worried thinking it would be more of a pot pie kind of texture (I don't like pie crust) but I can safely say it's more a bread texture. I can't believe I waited so long to try them! Before I knew it, mine was gone!  Service was great and fast! Another great time at ISCUYE!",

    "text": "There are few things I love more than foreign cuisines being adapted to new markets, and Arizona's Cornish Pasty Co. is an absolute brilliant rendition of a classic British dish extrapolated into the budding US Brewpub scene. The food, booze, and experience are all brilliant, and I'll go as far as to say that this is my favorite spot in the state.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Yes, it can get crowded at CPC, but such is the curse of a popular spot. There's ample seating both indoors and out, and I'm a big fan of the communal long tables that are growing increasingly popular. While not necessarily fast, service isn't notably slow, and the staff are generally friendly and knowledgeable. Honestly what more could you ask for? This is a great spot regardless of the size of your party or your type of outing. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  It's rare that I ever stray away from basing my reviews purely on the dishes that I personally order, but I need to take a quick minute just to note that CPC has a truly fantastic selections of brews on tap, and they price those brews at times more competitively than the liquor store. Brilliant. As for the food, a sizable pasty (3x or more times larger that what you'll find across the pond) will run you under $10, which is more than reasonable. They're filling, so absolutely no need to get more than one. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Excellent. While the expansive menu that combines traditional favorites with contemporary gems might have you wishing you could try them all, I went with a classic meat and cheese and couldn't have been more pleased. It'd be easy for CPC to pack their pasties with mediocre ingredients (such can be the nature of the dish), but the meats and cheeses here were excellent and brought together by fantastically buttery and flaky crust. To top it all off, the gravy proved an excellent addition, and the whole thing combo'd brilliantly with a hefty 32 oz. beer.   This was a marvelous dish, and I'll strongly argue that it's better than anything I've had in England. Dual Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Absolutely. With the variety, accommodation, reasonable prices and quality food, Cornish Pasty Co. is my favorite spot in the valley. This is as good as it gets. Star Granted.",

The pasty my fiance ordered was unavailable and he had to choose another. My pasty can out cold and very very dry. My gravy tasted like literal soap- not a comparison, it left a very base and soapy aftertaste.  We love Cornish, so we'll probably stick to Tempe. Great concept and menu, just a poor execution this time around.   Also worth noting, a kitchen worker blurted out \"THIS JOB BLOWS\" and then disappeared. It was entertaining enough to bump them from 1.5 to 2 stars.",

Everything went so well, and he walked me to my car.   When I got home, it was immediately brought to my attention that I had a giant piece of lettuce between my front teeth, which had no doubt been there for at least five hours, since my salad at lunch.   I hope he sees that as me being into clean eating, instead of seeing it as me being a disgusting slob.",

    "text": "The concept is very simple, but it has been executed flawlessly. The British Cornish Pasty is the Spanish empanada, the Jamaican patty, the Indian samosa. It is essentially meat and veg wrapped in pastry then baked. Done right it can be delicious!  I'm English. I grew up eating pasties. Although being from the north-west of England the pasties I ate weren't Cornish, they were a variation of the Irish pasty. Same concept, but lighter pastry, flakey, almost puff pastry. I always thought the crust of a True Cornish pasty was too tough, almost cardboard-esque, (some say they were made this way to prevent damage if they were dropped down a mine). But this is not the case for the pasties from Cornish Pasty Co. Here they are done well.  At Cornish Pasty Co they are light and tasty and the fillings were great. And oh, the choices! From the traditional Oggie to lamb or chicken or pork or cheese steak. There's even a tongue-in-cheek pasty which pays homage to Pulp Fiction. If you're a vegetarian, there aren't just a couple of choices, there is a whole page for you!  The beer list was extensive and varied, the patio wrapped around the whole building and the service was quick, attentive and engaging.",

We sat at the bar and ordered the chicken pot pie pasty (yes I know it was a safe choice, but sometimes you have to when at a new to you place) and fiance had the lamb curry pasty - there was a different name for it but that's how I remember it. Anyway, my pasty was good and fiance liked his. I wasn't a fan of his as something about it made it too sweet for my liking. They are big portions so when we go back, it would be fun to split one and get a couple of the sides to share as well. We had the mushy peas which were yummy as well. It was a bummer because 2 of the 3 things we originally ordered were 86'd so we had to go with option B.  I would definitely come back here to hang in the bar and grab a snack but its not a dinner place in my mind.",

There was such a selection of different combinations wrapped in a pastry shell. I chose the Pilgrim. It was so good. It was Thanksgiving in a shell.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it took quite a while to get our food. It wasn't very busy and we only had an hour for lunch. We ended up having to take most out food to go. I wouldn't have minded the wait if we had more time. It looks like a cool hangout.",

    "text": "Ok, I was at Lawrence Dunham Vineyards across the street for their grand opening and someone said you have to try the Cornish Pasty Company across the street. Being a big fan of Pasties and Shepherd/Cottage pie.. we gave it a try. The starter we ordered was some Vindaloo (I believe) hot wings. They were perfectly charred and still moist inside with a nice spicy kick.    The main entree's we split were the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Cottage Pie. WOW! What a lovely treat when the mains came out. The Chickent Tikka Masala was quite spicy and moist without having so much juice that it made a huge mess. The yogurt sauce was a nice calming flavor to counteract the spicy red curry. Usually you do not get a real curry kick when you go to a restaurant so be aware that this is the real thing. It's wonderfully spicy for those of you with a low tolerance just order something else. For those of you who adore curry and wanted an easy and tasty new way to eat it here in the U.S. this is for you.  I only say that because it's not the usual dish served up in the U.S. while pies and pasties have been the norm in the UK forever.  Big hit #1  The second was the Cottage Pie (shepherds=beef / cottage=lamb)  and this is so perfect. A nice mild lamb flavor with a wonderful cheesy, potato mix that is served with a red wine gravy. You get all the moisture without having a dripping mess on your hands. So perfectly cooked, and filling. If you want a great comfort food this is the one. Don't be fooled when you see it, this is one filling meal. I had trouble finishing although I couldn't keep from eating more than my stomach told me to. Loved it from start to finish.    The crust is nice and golden brown, not to thick but more than enough to keep everything inside. It's so flaky and perfect I have no complaints and had to write a review.  The photo I took is showing the Cottage Pie... the Chicken Tikka is the other half you can't see the inside of. The sauce is the yogurt sauce for the Tikka as it was dark and was the better sauce to show up in my photo.   Give it a try..it's worth stepping a few blocks out of the usually higher traveled old town area. This is worth getting up and driving out of the way for when you want a comfortable setting with plenty of outdoor seating, a huge bar with what looked like  a lot of beer choices. I loved the feel and the crowd it just had even with the smaller early week crowd. It was definitely bringing a bit of that Urban fun and people that Scottsdale needs. Just get there and enjoy.",

I dont remember her name but she was great. We ordered the meatballs which we were super excited to try and after we ordered them she came over and let us know they were sold out. We were a little disappointed but she already had a second recommendation for us which I appreciated. We got the wings instead and they were delicious! The sauce was so sweet and tangy. I loved them.  I ordered the chicken vindaloo pasty and my friend ordered the bangers and mash. Both were super good! They are basically just glorified hot pockets and I don't have any problem with that!   I didnt order a drink but I did notice that they had a great beer selection.

The patio wraps around two historical homes with pretty trees hanging over the tables. They have large tables to fit big groups and plenty of seating at the bar.

My question is, after Cornish miners worked all day in mines with loud mining machinery did they listen to loud music?  Some places like \"Johny Rockets\" are loud but have patio to get away from noise.   But this place has speakers on patio too.   Not as loud - we went out on patio, better to deal with flies than the louder noise inside.",

However, they were out of the pasty that I wanted (eggplant parm) and the food took forrrreeevverrr. The server was pleasant enough and she seemed like she meant well, but after she offered to refill our waters, she apparently forgot to actually follow through. Ultimately my second-choice Mexi Veggie pasty was delicious but all of the waiting left a bad taste in my mouth.",

One guy in our group had water spilled on his phone from waitress, another person received wrong food and the waitress said the kitchen forgot my order. It was an average crowd, but waitress said it was extremely busy, what will they do when snow birds & Spring Training arrives?! The worst part was about 8pm when I was hugging the toilet puking my brains out. I can only guess it was food poisoning. My guess is they rushed my order and didn't cook it long enough.",

I went there with my family and didn't have a reservation, because i had been told in the past not to make one with a party under 10. We were told it would be 15 to 20 minutes for a table and decided to wait. I asked if they had vegan options still available and told there were three. 20 minutes went by and we had to ask how long and then were told it would be another 15 to 20 minutes. We wanted to sit inside, but the were no tables and went outside. By then it had been almost 40 minutes. We weren't too order and were told they had only 2 vegan options now. My friend and i ordered one and my family ordered. Turns out what i ordered was not available any longer. They only has a spicy option. I said i couldn't eat that and we were going to leave. The waitress talked to the kitchen and they said they would throw something together. Fine. The waitress then comes back again fine minutes later and says they were out of almost everything my family ordered as well. By this point, we had been there over an hour and had only had water and everything we wanted to eat was sold out. We ended up leaving and didn't get dinner together. My family had driven from Glendale and we didn't even get to eat together for my birthday. We got a free iced tea though. I love their food, but don't think i will ever go back there after this.",

I had the Greek Chicken which was very tasty, I was concerned about the tzatziki as it looked like honey mustard, but was very good and I sampled my friends's Guinness pasty which was rib sticking! The waitress Andrea was exceptional as she was very attentive to us, provided us with good suggestions and was gorgeous!!  It is interesting to maintain the history of this dish, I am looking forward to having it in LA/California.",

The ploughman's plate was generous and tasty.  Pay the extra for the scotch egg! Deliciously different. We shared the Guinness pasty which lacked flavor.   I make Guinness stew and it can have flavor. They have a lot of menu items to choose from, so I would try this again and choose differently.",

What they have created is a family-friendly dive that's great for food and drinks. The Scottsdale location is quite lovely, having inhabited an old house boasting what just might be my favorite ground-level patio in the area. The place keeps their food simple, while offering a vast array. Seriously, there's gotta be about 40 pasties, a third of which are vegetarian (and maybe even vegan). I've tried about six of them over the last few visits (go with friends so you can share) and, while I have favorites of the lot, I haven't had one that disappoints. Speaking of other things that don't disappoint--the beer list. While not as expansive as the pasty list, there's something for everyone. Oh, and the bartenders can mix up great cocktails. Seriously, I love this place--whether it's a stop on a night out or the main event, it doesn't disappoint.",

He went far beyond and also earned my two crew members greatest respect with his selfless delivery of their meals.

    "text": "Oh how I love Cornish Pasty! I visited this place once about 3 years ago and was so happy to come back on my most recent trip to Phoenix. The history of cornish pasties is fun to read (be sure to check it out on the menu; it describes the origins of this kind of meal dating back to old mining towns... I'll leave that as a cliffhanger) and delicious to enjoy. This restaurant/bar pays tribute to this kind of dish in the best of ways... by creating their own delicious versions!  On the menu, you'll find about 30-40 kind of Cornish pasties ranging from the classic (chicken pot pie, shepherd pie, etc) to the exotic (greek, chicken tikka masala, spicy asiago and more). For those of you who might not know what a Cornish pasty is, it's essentially a mix between a pot pie and a calzone and includes some kind of fillings surrounded by a flaky crust/shell (in fewer words, it's a savory pie). My wife ordered the cheese and onion pasty (filled with potatoes, rutabaga, English cheddar and onions) while I ordered the chicken pot pie (chicken, carrots, red potato, green beans, celery, and onion in a rosemary and chicken gravy). Each pasty is made from scratch each day, so the result is something truly fresh and delicious! The chicken pot pie, for instance, was loaded with savory flavors. And the portions are so large that you'll either leave feeling stuffed, or (in our case) leave with half a pasty for leftovers.  In addition to pasties, the menu also includes salads, soups, appetizers and desserts, as well as a good number of options for beer, wine and spirits. Ambiance here is also enjoyable, especially in the evening when the weather is a bit cooler and the lighting more intimate.  Again, I was so glad to be able to visit this place on a local trip and will certainly be sure to visit again!",

    "text": "I love Cornish Pasty Co.  The first time I came here, I was a second year resident in the middle of my Burn Surgery rotation.  I was sleep-deprived, poorly-fed, and the only thing that kept me awake during the meal was the sheer deliciousness of the food being shoveled down my throat by my concerned husband.  Since then, I've been back a variety of times.  Pasty-wise, the Lamb and Mint is my usual go-to, but I also love the Bangers and Mash, the Shepherd's Pie, and the Chicken Tikka Masala.    I'm going to be weird here.  My last few visits, I've actually not gotten a pasty (cue the horrified gasps).  I'm now addicted to the Cream of Leek, Potato and Stilton Soup.  It comes with delicious fresh-baked bread that I use as a spoon.  A bowl of it will only set you back about $7, and honestly I think it's the best thing on the menu.  I've used the fact that I'm \"just having soup\" to justify having dessert recently (the Sticky Toffee Pudding is perfect!), and I think I'll probably continue to eat non-pasties at the Pasty Company in the future.",

This was an ok spot. Its strongest feature is its affordability in the downtown area. Service was spotty and slow.",

    "text": "Eating at Cornish Pasty Co. with two of my friends was very satiating. However, I was not completely captivated. I will list the reasons why I gave this place 4 (and not 5) stars.  Pros: The environment is relaxing, clean, and comely. I really enjoyed the convenience of a parking area, despite its near-the-neighborhood location. The environment of the restaurant itself has a grandma's-house feel, so it makes you extremely comfortable. The bathrooms (male) are absolutely spotless, and there was no trash or grease using around the floor. The food was simply delicious. I ordered the Oggie (it was my first time there) while my other friends ordered Bangers & Mash and Carne Adovada. The Oggie's pork, cheese, and potatoes were balanced well, and the red wine gravy goes well with the pasty itself. The pasty crust was very crispy, but the crispness went slightly over the top. The homemade lemonade that we ordered actually tasted homemade--not doused with too much sugar. It was almost worth the money for a decent amount of food.  Cons: Even though the environment was nice, the food took way too long to prepare. We were actually starting to wonder if something happened inside the kitchen when the food finally arrived. When we first walked in the restaurant, no waiter came to us to tell us what to do. They expect you to take your seat and order for yourself. Secondly, parts of our crust were burnt. I presumed that burnt crust was supposed to happen when I read about the history of the restaurant, since it states that women made a thick crimped part where the miners held their pasties, which I assumed will be similar to the burned part of my pasty. But upon seeing that one of my friends had neither of his pasties burnt, I wasn't too happy. There was a great balance between the fillings and the crust, but the meat was somehow overcooked.  Overall, I was personally pleased with my visit, and I will try to come here again if the location was not so far away from my house. No more KFC chicken pot pie for me, the crust is just not as good as this.",

We came here for dinner at the tow truck driver's recommendation that we MUST order the Cajun Chicken Pastry. We sat on the side patio and were not acknowledged so we relocated to the center communal table in the courtyard entry way. A few minutes later a man with a beard came over and asked me if I had been helped yet to which I answered in a very pissy way \"no\". Although I don't believe this man was a server, he rose to the occasion and got us water and coffee and introduced us to our server and made sure we were taken care of. It made my day better and the coffee and food was delicious. I'm glad we came here, definitely in need of the comfort food they serve.",

    "text": "One night after a Spring Training game, I felt adventurous and wanted to try something new.  This was when I discovered Cornish Pasty Co.  I actually had no idea what a cornish pasty was and had to wikipedia it.  Basically it is an English pastry where you place uncooked filling into a pastry crust and bake it.  That's simple enough.  Upon driving up to Cornish Pasty Co. at night, I noticed that the parking lot was fairly small and not well lit.  While walking up to the actual place, I loved the layout of the place.  There were dining tables on the inside and outside of the restaurant.  There was also a bar on the inside as well as the outside.  This is a pretty genius idea since Arizona temperature is crazy hot.  The bf and I sat on stools at the bar that was outside.  We experienced great weather that night.  There were also customers who sat in the outside bar area and brought their dogs along with them while dining.  These were not service dogs and they were allowed.  Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but if you can't discipline your dog/dogs, please don't bring them.  The whole time we were trying to enjoy our dinner, these two dogs were just barking and jumping up and down the whole time.  Even the owners couldn't calm and control their dogs.  It was actually kind of annoying.  I didn't realize I was at a dog park.  At the bar, we were immediately greeted by the bartender and he handed us the food menu as well.  I already knew before we got there that I wanted to try a pasty.  However, when I was browsing the menu, holy crap!  There were about 25 different pasties to choose from!  When they call it the Cornish Pasty Co., they were not kidding.  On top of that, there were also soups, salads, and appetizers that you could order.  I asked the bartender what their best seller was, but he was of no real help.  He basically said that all of the pasties are great.  After looking over the menu a gazillion times, I finally decided to go with The Oggie (The Traditional Pasty) which has a steak, potatoes, onion, and rutabaga filling along with a red wine gravy or ketchup on the side for only $8.75.  The bf ordered the Tandoori Wings appetizer ($6.50) which is basically chicken wings baked in tandoori marinade along with a side of lemon mint yogurt dip.  Tandoori wings at a restaurant that mainly serves English food?  Hmmm...   The food came out at a decent time.  We didn't have to wait too long.  The Tandoori Wings came out first since it is an appetizer.  I was actually blown away by how good the wings were!  Wow!  The four pieces of wings were not enough.  The dish also came with some cucumber slices as well as tomatoes.  It was really hard not to devour all of the wings.  I had to remind myself that this was my bf's order and not mine so instead, I started eating the cucumbers and tomatoes for him.  When my pasty came, it was very hot and hearty.  I actually thought the pasty was okay.  It wasn't anything super amazing and it wasn't bad either.  The Oggie kind of reminded me of a puff pastry being filled with beef stew and being baked.  I think I enjoyed the crust of the pastry more than I did the filling.  Overall, the service and food was good and the prices even better!  I recommend checking this place out if you're in the area!  Just watch out for Cujo.",

And the fact that I can eat this delightful food while drinking a British (or local) ale of my choice makes this place a favorite. The wide selection of options means that there is something everyone will like. If you're feeling a little adventurous, try the scotch egg--so good!

I first went here before quitting meat and dairy, so I've had a couple of the chicken pasties (BBQ is most memorable), and most recently had one of their vegan selections.  The vegan pasty was filled with greek fare like tomatoes, olives, spinach and was delicious.  My only complaint is that they are all made ahead of time, so there's no opportunity to order a pasty from the menu, plus or minus an item.  But c'est la vie.  It allows them to get food out onto the table in a very expeditious manner.  I've had happy here and the drinks are good, with a great beer selection.  If you're an omnivore, vegetarian, or vegan, you will find something to eat here... and unless your appetite is a hearty one, you will have leftovers!   Note: Parking is tough and is mainly on the surrounding streets.  Sometimes easiest to park on the other side of Goldwater and walk across.",

Kind of strange, but I'll take it.   The food was pretty good.  I'm not a pasty guy, but I can't complain about it since I decided to dine at a place which specializes in pasties.  That's on me.    The only con is that this place seems like a hipster hangout.  Each time I've been, I've noticed quite a bit of those annoying types.  They can ruin any environment.

I wish Cornish Pasty Co. came to Southern California (just sayin!)    I ordered a pasty of course because that's what you do.  I ordered the Shepard's pie pasty with beef.  They also make the cottage pie with lamb, same ingredients.  Honestly it tasted like lamb which I don't like the taste of and I had to send it back to the kitchen.  They didn't argue but offered me another dish on the menu.   I decided to get their Red Pepper, Black Bean, Rice, Chicken, Jalapeno soup with their amazing homemade soda bread and butter.  Honestly it was amazing.  I am still dreaming of that dish and probably could eat it for days.    I gave them five stars because they have a great ambiance, the service was great (friendly) and while the food is fresh and yummy they took care of my little issue politely and made it easy for me to change.  I'll be back unless you open a restaurant in So. Cal!!",

Rather than college kids looking for good food or the older crowd looking for their silverware in the darkness of Mesa, you get more of a hipster/Old Town vibe. The ambiance isn't as unique as other locations. From lighting and use of space, it doesn't compare to other locations.  But the food is better. The portions are bigger. The pasties are tastier.

    "text": "I checked it out based on a reddit post -- thank you! -- and had the vegetarian tandoori pasty during lunch w/ red iced tea. My stomach growled on the way in from the parking lot once the curry welcomed me and I hoped it was the place. It was!  I eat vegan, vegetarian, organic, and all that without being pretentious and have dined at pretentious places that specialize in that sort of thing...   ...and none come close to whatever Cornish Pasty does with the tandoori spices and fake meat made from seitan. AMAZING.  I've eaten my way through India, love anything Thai, and was raised drinking spicy homestyle AZ salsa.  Cornish Tandoori is in my Top 10. The consistency and flavors even tricked my carne friend :)  My newly retired brit friends loved the layout, people watching, and weather. Divine! One had the carne pasty and the other one had a potatoes pasty... fuzzy details as I was more impressed by the layout, music vibe, and friendly crowd... and completely enrapt by my order. Spent my time wondering how to recreate it at home. Perfect spice blend. They should bottle it and sell it; hook me up with a free lunch ;)  Our excellent server, Dean, informed us the architectural design was made by moving 2 mid-century farmhouses from elsewhere on the property up to the walkable street then conjoining them. There's even a tree framed in the middle between restaurant patio and bar.   Dean was also accommodating when we requested to move tables to enjoy the nice outdoor weather. He gave us no attitude at all; totally nice guy who made an afternoon awesome for my otherwise high maintenance friends. He took pride in his job plus was very patient at explaining menu items, making recommendations, and attentive to our needs. Other staff walked by to constantly refill our drinks and make sure we were taken care of... Very classy lunchtime service.  I noticed indoor bar style seating so you can see how the pasties are made-- great for any boring/awkward date where at least there's something visual to hopefully cue some sort of conversation. If not, then at least you got some scrumptious food out of it. But enough about my dating life. The cure is tandoori!  Sit inside or outside and take in the mellow, Dick Dale surf guitar vibe. Could've sworn we were at a beachside cafe. Reminded me of a Santa Barabara, LA, or San Diego boardwalk-- great food, relaxing environment, soft sunlight, light breeze. I was hooked.  Went back on a different night to check out the beers on tap and wasn't disappointed. Again, friendly, laid-back staff (Bartender: Ed?). He made recommendations and helped me decide on a great craft beer from CO.   Cornish Pasty is an easy place for family, friends, coworkers, or if you're single without feeling awkward about dining solo. The experiences helped me decide to spend more time in the Dale of Scots, for sure.  I debated throwing this up on Yelp because I kinda like it as an undiscovered hangout. And I'm bad with the names of the staff but they were excellent to me. If more of the right crowd continues to end up here, no doubt it will maintain its calming charm.  Hope this place makes a killing during Spring Training and becomes a mainstay. Can't wait to eat here again.",

The servers are friendly and prompt, and the place has a casual, but slightly more upscale atmosphere. If it's a nice night, their deck is the perfect place to socialize and to try a new pasty! But wait - before you get to the pasty, you need to try those bacon-wrapped meatballs... they're amazing!!! Anyway - back to the pasty. I've tried 3 or 4 of them, and I've never found one I didn't like. The Mexican-style one is my current fave, but the pesto chicken one is great too. This is definitely a place to go hungry or to share - these things are big, and boy are they filling. If you've never had a pasty, it's sort of like a calzone, but with fillings that are more like a pot-pie or something similar. Very very good! The only thing to be aware of is that they prepare most of these before you order... so pick one that you don't have to change. (As in, they can't remove the onions from it for you or that kind of thing). But hey, if pasties aren't your game, their salads are great too! The Greek with chicken comes with an awesome green dressing... I have no idea what it is (some kind of vinaigrette?) but it's fantastic! I'd buy bottles of it if they sold it. All in all, a great place for a chill dinner and a cold beer - give it a shot!",

So if you don't like sauerkraut, you can't order a Reuben; if you're allergic to onions, you can't order a Pilgrim, etc.  I met family here; they were visiting from out of town and the reviews for this place looked good and it said the place was okay for kids. The waiter was very polite and patient when my niece was grabbing ice out of our glasses, and brought some extra napkins. The food was also amazing, and very filling. One pasty is enough for about two meals for me. I was very sad when I had driven away and suddenly realized I left the to-go boxes on the table :( At least I still have the most delicious burps ever.",

Environment: Super Chill Food: 5 Star+ Staff: Very friendly  Tomato Soup with homemade bread -  chewy and melted as you chew the bread. I would buy a whole package and eat everyday if I'm not in a fitness program, and too bad it's their homemade only.  Scotch Egg -  not bad, good addition; not impressive though.  Salmon, ham, melted cheese pasty - it tastes way x3 better than it looks. Hot & Crispy pasty. Can't explain how much satisfaction it gives. Never had better \"Sandwich\", period!   Hot Sticky Toffee Pudding - Hot Pudding vs cold ice cream. Put the ice cream in it and you won't forget this taste. It's the taste of childhood.",

I have tried a different pasty each time I've visited the one in Tempe, and this brand new place knocks it out of the park.  Eat half your pasty, pack up the rest and save room for the sticky toffee pudding! It's rich and tasty, and served with ice cream, which makes it a perfect dessert. Yummmmmmy!",

Unfortunately, our server Alejandra made us feel less than important. We waited ridiculously long for everything, and I finally had to approach her for our check.

The story ends with one friend having her debit card get lost and me not receiving any food. Can't wait for my in n out though! That place never disappoints. I waited for over a year and was very excited to go to Cornish but at the end of the day, I can now say I wasn't missing out on anything. Haven't tried a pasty and never will.

The Oggie is always a classic and the Pilgrim was excellent, but the service sucked, just like the other locations.  For a Thursday night, it wasn't too busy.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the great weather.  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and gave us quite a few suggestions on which Pasty's to branch out on.  After we ordered, the service went downhill as it took about 35 minutes for us to get our food.  I can understand that these pasty's are handmade, baked in the oven, but it shouldn't take that long to get your food.  Maybe if there were 40 tickets ahead of yours on a busy Friday or Saturday night, sure... but it was damn near empty.  I would like to see how Cornish Pasty Co. handles themselves on a busy Friday or Saturday night.  I was severely disappointed by the crappy service and will likely leave a bad taste in my mouth for a dine-in experience.  Maybe this was a fluke, but I have had very similar experiences at each location and its disappointing.",

I asked the server which of the pasties are most popular and one she mentioned was the Pilgrim, which is turkey/chicken, sweet potatoes, grilled onions and stuffing with red wine gravy and cranberry sauce.

One con is that they do not have great sides to accompany their pasties.",

Tuesday must be a slower night because hardly anyone was there but my server was very friendly and my pasties were very good.

My boyfriend and I came to place a take-out order, and waited at the bar looking into the kitchen and prep area for our order. Out of the 11 visible kitchen employees, 6 of them were not wearing hair nets and 5 of them were not wearing gloves. One female employee had her long hair down, and the others had longer hair and bears. All of these employees were handling and prepping food. As someone who has contracted food poisoning before, as well as finding hair in my food, I will not be returning to an establishment that has such abysmal food handling policies. Yuck.  Update in response to the restaurant- the other 5 employees without hairnets were men without hats. No hats, no hair net. I did see the employee with the hat and beard net. I also saw the employee slicing onions with no hair or hair net, the employee slicing potatoes with no hair or hair net, and the runner with no hat or hair net",

The menu was a little overwhelming with so many options {tons of vegetarian options too!} to choose from and they ALL looked delicious! I started with the garden salad {Their homemade lemon pesto vinaigrette was aaamazing!}, the chips with garlic AND jalapeno {if you like a kick} are a must and the Cheesesteak pasty was everything that I wanted and more, packed with grilled steak, onions, peppers, mushrooms and creamy cheese, served with a red wine gravy or mustard sauce for dipping (I got both because I'm a sauce freak!). They also have $4 Irish Car Bombs everyday if you feel like getting a little wild! We will definitely be back soon!",

The decor is somewhat rustic, the wait staff very accommodating and friendly, but if you need a back on your seat carefully choose where you're seated. (Lots of bench seats) We started with the Cornish Meatball appetizer and shared it as the portion was very ample.  For the main course my wife chose the Oggie (The Tradition Pasty) and I had the Peppered Steak which had a delightful brandy cream sauce and Stilton blue cheese inside the pasty.  Our dessert was the chocolate bread pudding (superb) and since it was my birthday a complimentary drink called a Car Bomb which is about 4 inches of Guinness, a shot of Jameson and a shot glass of Baileys which gets dropped in and chugged.  What a great meld of flavors.  We've known about the restaurant for quite some time (Check Please Arizona) and now regret we hadn't tried it sooner.  It was soooo good we'll be having dinner there on New Years Eve.   This place just made our list of repeat eateries.",

The basic pasty was quite good, but the atmosphere for dining was absolutely horrible.  The \"music\" they were playing was mostly noise.  When I mentioned to the server that it was not exactly dining music, she reported that the bartender had said the same thing.

We would have to get the second appetizer with our main course.  Keep in mind that the appetizer was a cheese and bread board that did not need to be cooked.  We were told we could not take an ingredient out of an item, never been told that before, and three times that daughter gave her order  the response was \"we are out of that.\"  It was a very long wait for our food and when it came out they forgot to prepare one of the meals.  One of our guests said it was a place he would not return and unfortunately I feel the same.  There are many great restaurants in Scottsdale to choose from and this is not one of them.",

Tried the peppered steak pasty as well as the oven chips. Portions are legit, if you're hungry you'll probably finish a full pasty but if not ravenous, leftovers for later! There's so much delicious on the menu that I will have to return. Their teas were refreshing and their pasties piping hot.

Three of the four of us ordered Tea. Two of us ordered the Hibiscus green tea. I thought it was tasty but my friend did not. JJ swapped it out for the regular black tea and S. was satisfied. S. ordered the Sausage Salad ($8.75) and asked JJ if the kitchen would just include one container of dressing instead of the usual 2. No problem. S. loved the salad. Plenty of sausage with just the right amount of red peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, red onion and feta cheese. T. ordered the Royale, ($9.00), Medium. The only Pasty in the group. Funny. It's basically the innards of a cheeseburger plus french fries wrapped up in a pasty. T said it wasn't that great. The french fries were soggy and didn't add a good texture to the experience. He said the hamburger meat, mushrooms, bacon, grilled onions and cheese were fine.  S. ordered the Pasta Salad, ($8.75). Bow Tie pasta with feta, parmesan, sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, kalamata olives and roasted red peppers. She gave it a thumbs up.  I ordered the Chicken Tikka Salad, ($9.00). Basically a whole chicken breast marinated in Indian spices and then baked, sliced and put atop a bed of Romaine lettuce. Cherry tomatoes, red onions and cucumbers round out the mix. I had the mint-yogurt dressing on the side. Yummy stuff. The chicken was perfectly spiced. This was a good salad. Good food, good service, good pricing. 4 Stars.",

Three months ago tried to order the strawberry beer on tap at the time and also the peppered steak pasty.  Waitress came back to give me disappointing news that the beer and steak are all gone.  Frown face. Month later take some friends that are in town to try the place and 3 of the 4 pastys we wanted are out.  DAMN. Last month come back with the old lady and what she wants they don't have and also didn't have my first 2 choices of beer either.   This can be a coincidence or just bad luck....fine I can take both.  Then tonight  happens and tried to go to my first choice of beer..shot down.  My buddy gets shot down on his 3 choices of pastys. The lady get shot down on her choice.  I went for the Italian as my 1st choice was eliminated as well.  Our server comes back 30 minutes after we placed our order to say that she had forgotten to put the orders for the pastys in and to top it off they are out of the Italian.  She then gets our new order and 40 minutes later we get our dinner.  The place was not even busy it was a Wednesday at 7:45pm on a day that was 116 and no one was thinking of eating pastys except us.  Like any place in Old Town Scottsdale the slower the restaurant is the shittier the service.",

Was I a little cautious when deciding to eat here? Absolutely not. Having read some of the yelp reviews, I was pretty certain that the food here was going to be awesome. I was not disappointed! I ordered the Oggie, a traditional pasty and it tasted exactly as it should have tasted. It was a real Cornish pasty. I was in food heaven. The decor is quite like a traditional English pub, although it has an American feel to it. There are no dart boards but otherwise the place could be transplanted to England and it could fit in nicely. The beer selection is outstanding. The menu offers a wide variety of pasty choices so all tastes can be accommodated. Just remember that you are eating at an establishment that specializes in one item. So, order a pasty, you won't be disappointed!",

The service can  be a bit slow at times, but the made from scratch offerings makes up for it.  The first time I came here I had a lamb pasty with red wine sauce, a real winner. The second time I got the Reuben pasty--delish.  The third time I had the traditional pasty made with beef and rutabaga, divine.  They are baked to order; be ready for a wait, but the freshness of the pasties will make any wait time a triviality.  This is not fast food and it shows.   The pasties come with a multitude of fillings, so everyone can find something to satisfy their taste buds. While most of the pasties are filled with meat, vegetarians and vegans are not forgotten here.  The restaurant makes two vegan pasties daily, and the menu has numerous vegetarian options.  The soups are fabulous and homemade.  At $7.00 a bowl, the potato, leek, Stilton soup is practically a meal in itself.  It comes with homemade bread and will fill you up, making it a cheap, delicious lunch or light dinner.  I've also had the tomato soup, another winner, and there are more I haven't tried.  The desserts are sublime.  Last time I had the banoffee pie, an English dessert pie made with toffee, bananas and whipped cream, homemade and luscious.  On another visit I had the chocolate bread and butter pudding--fantastic.    The menu is extensive and includes salads, appetizers and sides, not to mention a full bar and a wine and beer list.  The ambiance is laid  back and decidedly English, with its dim lights and dark, wooden furniture.  However, it's kid friendly and your family will enjoy this place.  I came here with my granddaughter once and she ate all my potato-leek soup!  Go  on down to the Old Town area and have a new taste experience at this restaurant, where everything is made from scratch and it shows in the quality of the food.",

I ordered the Pilgrim for my daughter but she doesn't like onions. I asked if the onions can be taken off. The waitress replied with No addition or substitution. Hello, this is called \"substraction\". I didn't ask for extra or change. If you can't accommodate a simple request like this, I will think twice if I will come again. Take care of your customers and improve the service.",

This restaurant sits in the shadows of old town, just south of the hussle and bussle around Camelback.    I give this place 4 stars because the pasties are just as yummy and tasty as the orginal, but this building that it is in is just beautiful.  A prefect British pub with these HUGE tables.  this is the perfect place for a large group.  I think our group was about 18 or so and we all sat at one table.  And there aren't just a few large tables, there are a ton of them.  They have this fantastic and beautiful patio.  I can't wait to return and sit out there.",

Staff wasn't friendly nor helpful, we stood in the entry walking around for several minutes looking lost and confused (they were empty) and no one acknowledged us until I finally acknowledged them. I ordered the bangers and mash pasty which was blah, no flavor - tons of potatoes but no meat - whats up with that? The chicken liver pate was delish though.  The real kicker is that I got sick off of their food that evening - Super disappointed since they were one of the restaurants on my places I needed to check out in the Valley.",

This restaurant specializes serving the Cornish Pasty. They offer a multitude of varieties and a long list of vegetarian ones to choose from.   I ordered the traditional \"Oggie\" pasty. It was a thin crispy crust stuffed with nicely seasoned moist beef, potatoes, onions and rutabagas. It was delicious as it was but when you hit it with the wine gravy then it becomes super delicious!  As delicious as my pasty was I'm glad I stopped eating at half. When I got up I felt full. My waiter was very helpful and efficient and offered me extra sauce to take home with the yummy half I brought home. I don't think it's possible to leave hungry from here.  The parking lot is very small and you might not get a spot. You can easily park across the street by the shops.  A very solid 4 stars...",

I enjoy most of the vegetarian pasties (eggplant parm and the greek with spinach, mozzarella, feta, tomatoes, etc.), but my absolute fave is the Cheese and Onion pasty. It is filled with potatoes, onion, rutabaga and cheese and it is just deliciously simple. In my humble opinion, ketchup needs to be your dipping sauce of choice when you're eating this baby. I've tried it with marinara but it just doesn't have enough \"bite\".  For dessert you cannot go wrong with the banofee pie pasty. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, fresh whipped cream and sliced bananas make this treat a MUST TRY. It is sooo gooood. And the Apple Caramel Pasty is a very, very close second. That thing is fantastic!  While I have patronized the Tempe location, I prefer Scottsdale. It's cleaner and there are far less hipsters in flannel shirts with huge beards strutting around.",

As with the 1st time we came here, you can get a little lost in where to go when trying to get inside as there appear to be many doors. If you enter from the front of the place, there appears to be better signage as to where to go. We walked in and they told us to sit anywhere. They didn't appear to be very busy and our server showed up pretty quickly.  I ordered the bangers and mash and boyfriend got the Italian. Both were delicious!!! I think it just depends on what mood I'm in for whatever flavor of pasty I get. We switched halves so if I got half of each. Each of us got a beer, which they have a pretty wide selection of beer (draft and bottles/cans) with some local beers to choose from. We also ended up getting the sticky toffee pudding dessert (only because the chocolate bread and butter pudding was sold out). We got it with ice cream and it was very delicious despite ours being just a touch overcooked. We decided that we need to come to this place more often as the pasties are filling and delicious and go great with a beer! The only thing this place needs are some TVs to watch soccer games to go with the vibe of the restaurant!  Overall, we will definitely add this place into our rotation of regular places to eat. If you haven't had a pasty before, give it a try!  Also to be noted, they appear to have vegetarian options.",

Apparently British miners found these to be ideal vehicles for meals, and they got popular. This place specializes in them, albeit for a price much higher than what a miner could afford.   The location itself is okay. There is bench seating at large, often shared tables. There was no obvious place to enter, lending to confusion early on. I felt like I had to hunt down a waitress.   The food was boring. The pasty I had - bangers and mash - was piping hot but about as exciting as cafeteria food. The execution was unquestionably good, but I felt like I was simply wading through a sea of okay chopped meat and boring mashed potatoes. The seasoning could have been improved a lot.  Those eating with me had marginally burned pasties, though their filling was slightly better.   Don't get me wrong - this place isn't bad. It just certainly wasn't for me.",

The menu is large and offers Pasties with just about any filling you can imagine....and some you probably did't think of! There is even a large section just for Vegetarians & Vegans! And if that is not enough for you, they also have appetizers, salads and desserts! The salads were a good size and greens were crisp & fresh.  We ordered the curry bean dip for an appetizer and it came out with fresh carrot sticks and house made cracker/pita type chips.  We have been to England and eaten Pasties in quite a few different cities & towns over there, and these are the closest to those as I have had in the States.  Come with a large appetite or someone to share with because this place is generous with their servings!",

My brother had also ordered these meatballs that had a slight mustard/onions sauce and they were wrapped in bacon. Also, for the Cornish Pasty's:  I ordered a vegetarian portobello mushroom with balsamic, red pepper, mozzarella, and fresh marinara. The crust was thin and flaky.  My Brother ordered the chicken Tika Masala., served with tzaziki.  Crust again, prepared to perfection.   The chicken masala was absolutely delicious. The sauce I would've preferred if it was a Tamarind or mango, other than that absolutely perfect.  We also had a Coldwater brew which is absolutely delicious.  We didn't order it but we're going to have to go back and get it... They have pumpkin pie Cornish pasty's... I kid you not. OMG I've got to have it. Especially with that crust.  I was also watching them make chocolate bread pudding, Can we all say yes please?",

We have tried the: Bangers and Mash, The Royale with cheese, The Shepard's pie, the Pesto Chicken, and Rosemary steak.  I have only tasted Pesto, Shepard's pie, and Bangers and Mash. I thought Bangers and Mash was a little too salty the Shepard's pie was okay. I preferred the Pesto.  I wanted to try the chicken greek but it was all sold out :( Overall the food is interesting and I am totally down to explore other flavors.   Pasty cannot be modified as they are pre-made, that's what my cousin was told when he tried to get the onions excluded in the royale. He said the onion was fine when he ate it though haha.",

We like to rely on our servers for recommendations. There's quite a variety of inviting menu items, and our server was very knowledgeable and helpful. Started off with a Guinness and CPC Blonde, shared a half garden salad, and split a Guinness Stew pasty, and a Scotch Egg.  Food was delicious.  Impressed with the vegan menu as well. The history as written on the menu about the Cornish Pasty is interesting.  We will definitely be back to enjoy more of the menu offers.",

I had been to both the Tempe and Chandler locations (Tempe being my favorite), but living 4 minutes away, we had to try this one. I love the open, airiness of this location. It was much more inviting and seemed like anyone was welcome. There were people just sitting having a beer, kinda strewn about and not really at a table. It instantly made me feel like I was in place. I must also give a shout out to our bartender because I'm not exactly the easiest person to make a drink for and he made me a custom lemonhead-type martini that sent me into heaven. In fact, so much so that I got a second! We grabbed an Italian & a Chicken Pot Pie, with a caramel apple pasty for dessert. Left fat and so so happy.",

We called at 6:45 to see if you we could get a table for 8 around 7:30 since we were at The Henry in Arcadia and the wait was 3 hours and the wait staff was rude. The staff was so accommodating! They told us to come over as soon as we could and they would get a table ready. When we arrived they had a table waiting for us inside. They also have a gorgeous patio that wraps around the whole restaurant!   They have a huge selection to choose from, I got the Pilgrim which is Thanksgiving food themed (so delicious!). My coworker was super happy since she is a vegetarian and they had a whole page of food items for her to choose from, not just salads! She says she wants to eat there every week now! Our group also tried a few beers we had never heard of that were great! We even had a banana bread beer! I will definitely be going to Cornish Pasty now that it is closer to my house!",

Really good comfort type food. The setup of the place is great with no problem sitting at the bar and ordering your meal. This gives the added pleasure of people watching everyone as they arrive as well as an open air view of the walking street traffic in front. Nice service from the bartenders with everyone working as a team. Love that approach. This is not a high end spot but, delicious comfort food that seems to have an overwhelming loyal base of people.",

I haven't ever dined in at this (Scottsdale) location, but have ordered to go several times with co-workers. All of us have commented that we become less impressed with the place after each time we order. More times than not, the order is incorrect (missing pasties, missing dressing, missing soups, no bread...) The staff isn't particularly friendly and the food is inconsistent at best - sometimes the Tomato soup is to die for, other times it is over salted and bland. They are inconsistent in what constitutes a bowl vs. a cup of soup (you would think they would have containers for each size...no, apparently the portion is whatever the cook feels like you should get). Staff definitely doesn't appreciate being asked about this. Our orders typically amount to $80-$100 so you would imagine that our regular patronage would be appreciated, but this just doesn't seem to be the case. We were ordering from this location at least once a week, after multiple less than great experiences, not one of my co-workers have suggested that we order from this place in quite some time.",

However, one of the biggest draws for me if that it is open late. Even if the social hub of Scottsdale Old Town, most kitchens close around 10pm. Cornish Pasty is open till midnight.  I have tried most of their pasties. I have yet to have a bad one. However, a few could use a bit more spices.  I also wish they had a reverse happy hour starting around 10pm. It usually has less than a dozen in the restaurant when I have been there late night. I think this place could be more popular with its relaxed patio would be great for a casual drink with friends at that after 10pm window.",

Oddly, we couldn't decide where to go to dinner, yet I ordered the chicken tikka masala pasty and he the lamb vindaloo, so it seems to me, all the pre-dinner discussion was quite ridiculous.  Both were so yummy!  Pastry was flaky, fillings were excellent and with the amount of heat you would expect from both dishes in an Indian restaurant.  I also loved that all of their pasties can be purchased partly baked to finish in the oven at home!  So technically, you could serve them to your friends and pretend you made them yourself!  And if you're a beer drinker, the list is long.  I had an elderberry cider which was delicious, but not so good with the tikka masala.  I should have planned ahead before ordering.  There is a ton of seating, although a fair amount of the indoor seating is long tables with bench seating for large parties or communal dining.  Not so much a fan of that, but then again, I'm probably somewhat anti-social.  We went on a Sunday evening, fairly early, and there was plenty of available seating, however.  We look forward to trying many, many more of those pasties!",

I told her what the other server told me and she (Ashley) came up with a lie, \"oh, last week we had vegan peanut butter and jelly.\"  Wow! No allergies here, but haven't eaten dairy in over two years and was lied to about what ingredients are used.  On top of all that, we got there at 6:40pm and didn't get to eat until 7:50pm! Not too good, especially if it's pre-made anyway.  I would recommend going during slow times and not if you have diet restriction because not only is it limited but they apparently either don't know the ingredients and food items or just give False information that could be deadly to some guests.

Walking in, the smell of flaky crust and fresh baked Pasty's entices you, but for me - the flavor fell flat.  I ordered the Asiago Chicken Pasty. The inside was lined with hablano pepper, chicken, black beans and cheese. I'm not sure what type of seasoning was used, but no flavor really stuck out. Almost Like the chicken and pepper were boiled in a pot and thrown in. The spice of the pepper was not too powerful, but it was the most prominent flavor - or sensation I guess.  The crust was done well, but it wasn't as flaky as I personally would've liked. I don't know if I would try this place again. The waitress didn't really seem to want to be there - which is fine, but At least try and hide it lol",

I have been to pasty a lot of other times I love the cream of leek soup!!! Everything I have had has been amazing.  Thanks Cornish pasty!!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have visited a handful of Cornish Pasty Co's locations and have found that they are all largely consistent in terms of food. This location, off of Goldwater Blvd, is no different.  It's a simple concept that just flat out works, in my opinion. There's a wide variety of pasties to choose from. Everyone can find one that fits their personal taste. My go-to is an Italian, while my girlfriend likes their Pilgrim, which executes like a miniature Thanksgiving dinner.   One of these days, I'm just going to mail-order a bunch of different pasties and bake them myself regularly throughout the week.    Of course, when you have a boatload of different options that cover all kinds of territory, I can easily see this approach being a complete disaster. Fortunately, that's not the case here. The ingredients are all great quality and the shortcrust used in the pasties are so flavorful that I could easily eat one without any fillings and still be satisfied.  Starters, such as their bread and baked chips (fries) are consistently good, while I've yet to try every one of their desserts due to our mutual love of their chocolate bread pudding. Warm and crispy on the outside, with an interior that's moist and gooey, it's easily one of the better puddings that I've ever sampled and one that I often end up comparing others to.  While I still prefer eating my pasties in the dark and seedy basement of the Downtown location, this is a respectable substitute if you just happen to be in the area.  CPC will always be a top choice!",

The outdoor patio would be great on a cool day.   Our food arrived without a long wait and was even more delicious than we remembered. My Cottage Pie had the great pastry on the outside with well seasoned meat, potatoes, and vegetables inside. The red wine gravy is the best and makes an already tasty dish even better.",

I had the creamy tomato soup that came with soft delicious bread and the portobello mushroom chicken pasty. The pastry was delicious and so were the mushrooms, but the chicken was extremely dry.   On the freeway during rush hour traffic I had to ask my boyfriend to get off at the nearest exit and speed to the closest bathroom. I hope management does something about this problem so that no one else gets sick.  UPDATE: Thank you for your response Tyler, however, this is not the first time I've heard of someone getting sick from your food. A few of my friends and family have gotten sick as well. Perhaps not everyone who has gotten sick from your food calls or writes reviews to inform you.",

I started with a delicious IPA, and then went to the menu! This place isn't called Cornish Pasty Company for nothing, they have a ton of them on the menu, and everyone of them sounded delicious! But I grew up eating these and I had to go old school and order the Oggie, this is an original recipe pasty of steak, potatoes, and rutabaga, My childhood favorite, my mom used to make them! Now I was worried about eating something this heavy that late at night, but the pasty was just the right size to be a filling meal, but not make you feel like you swallowed a Volkswagen! The crust was flaky yet firm enough to hold together and the fillings were delicious! The steak was tender, and the potatoes and rutabaga were soft but not mushy! The seasonings were spot on, and oh man that gravy! This was a delicious meal, at a fair price, in a lovely environment! And they're open till midnight! In Scottsdale that's a rarity! I highly recommend this place if you're in the area, it's so worth a stop in!",

We also had the spicy red pepper chicken soup, which we treated more like a dip. More good flavors here and make sure to ask for extra bread!  Also ordered the Pimm's cocktail - this is my one bad part of the review. It was overwhelmingly sweet, I only took one sip and that was enough for me. I'm not sure this is a good cocktail place, but plenty of other beverages on the menu to suit your liking.  Unfortunately, we only came in for a snack so we didn't have any pasties, but I will definitely be back to try them very soon!",

There wasn't a whole lot of action going on, it appeared to be a pretty mellow night.  They have a great selection of Beer and to my delightful surprise, they also have Hendricks Gin! We asked the bartender for some suggestions in what to order. I took him up on the Carne Adovada: New Mexican style pork red chili stew, Mexican rice, hatch chili, and cheddar with sides of sour cream and salsa. Wowza! Was it goooooooood!!!  My husband ordered the The Porky: Pork, potato, apple, onion, and sage with a side of red wine gravy. This one was just OK. I will say this was not one of the recommendations from the bartender. My husband makes a dish called a Sausage Plait, which is essentially what the Porky Pasty is so he was hoping the Pasty was going to be the same. The Pasty was just OK, it lacked flavor and the pork was really gamey tasting. There was no flavor of Apple at all, and the Sage was pretty non existent. I think the strong flavor of the pork really took over. It didnt taste freshly made. My husband ate half of it and discarded the other half. The bartenders are not at all in tuned with the bar guests unless the attention is solicited. I truly feel as though the 2 bartenders could have cared less if we were sitting at the bar or not. I tried to make conversation but it mostly fell on deaf ears. We would get very short one word answers back. I understand it may just be the culture, but when you're a bartender I feel as though you should be engaging with your guests. All in all we had a good time and will probably return. The food and drinks are pretty solid. We will most likely opt for a table on the next visit.",

I expect most of their pasty to be all pretty consistent.  I still like the spicy asiago chicken.  May be I will try a new flavor as their menu is pretty extensive.  Was able to try the cheese Royale, as well.  Still preferred to chicken.   Service was pretty good as we had a big group.  Time for ordering until meal actually came out is also pretty quick.  Cool interior decoration, which I guess most of the cornish pasty locations must have.   Clean restroom inside.  They also have  seating on the outside. Limited parking spot.

Also, the patrons are less of an annoyance in comparison to, say, the Mill avenue location. Additionally, the parking here is so much better than the other locations.  We've tried just about every pasty permutation that they offer - the Oggie, Bangers, Royale, Shepherds, etc etc, and we still haven't found a disappointing one in the bunch.  They always come out fresh, hot, and full of delectable ingredients that just light up one's palate. Cutting into one of these meat pies is almost a shame as they are beautifully golden with a flaky crust.

I was surprised to see their menu had grown exponentially, as well as their locations. I went with a friend feeling as though I had already experienced the Cornish Pasty and I have to say, this was as though I were visiting for the first time.   Our server was very attentive and very kind. I personally prefer vegan and he was quick to inform me of the options that were available and went ahead to double check that the options were still on hand.   I asked which he would have chosen out of the ones I was debating on and he offered his input which did not disappoint. He also suggested a few to my friend who made a selection that was out for the evening. Again, did not disappoint.   I had the Vegan Pesto Pasty and it was incredibly delicious! So good, definitely difficult to believe that there was no cheese in it because of the creamy and savory flavor. It was meaty with the mushroom and artichoke.... Mmmmm.... Oh my goodness sooooo good!   I also ordered the pasta salad. As simple as it is, with bowtie pasta, spinach, olives, artichokes, roasted bells, sundried tomatoes and a light dressing, amazing! Truly. My friend indicated that it was by far the best salad he had ever tasted, yet so simple.  I appreciated the fact that we were lingering after we had eaten and paid our tab. Neither myself nor my friend were drinking but we were in the midst of friendly conversation and our server did not push us out. In fact, he continued to keep our waters full even after we were all closed out. That to me, spoke volumes! Wonderful customer service, absolutely!   I appreciated the blankets available for use, although I did not require one, it was a nice warming feeling.   I will definitely be back and I will most certainly speak highly of my experience here! Good job guys, you nailed it!",

You won't find these anywhere else In the area and, boy, are they good! The Chicken Pot Pie and Chicken Tilka Masala Pie are the ones I always get.  That said, every time I've had a bite of a friend's pie they are invariably outstanding. The crust is flaky, perfectly browned and the fillings hot and delicious.   As for the atmosphere, this is a British-style pub like the ones in the UK. It's a dark, rambling, cozy, carpeted, wallpapered, curtained refuge from the world.  Of course, this is Arizona, so the bar does open to a patio. It clearly isn't the product of some marketing department's version of a British pub--no bright lights, no posters of British Invasion bands, no phalanx of Union Jacks hanging from the ceiling. I get the feeling the owner is a transplanted Brit or someone who has spent a lot of time across the pond.  Wait staff tends to be on the hipster side with tats, nose rings, but no hipster attitude. They're very friendly.   Beer selection is good with a nice stable of regulars and imaginative rotations.   If you like meat pies, don't miss it.",

Too many times I visit and it's early in the day around 1130 and the server gives us a laundry list of pasty's they are out of.  it can make for quite the disappointing experience especially when multiples of your favorite options are on the 86 list.    This place also has some of the best scotch eggs in town.  The mustard dipping sauce that comes with them is super tangy and sweet, goes perfect with the salty sausage and egg.  The wings are also some of the best in town.  The parliament wings and that sauce is finger licking good!

    "text": "What a fun dinner location in old town Scottsdale! Having been a long time patron of Cornish Pasty in Tempe, it was fun to travel to Scottsdale for a great goodbye dinner. Located in Old Town right off Goldwater and 1st st, Cornish Pasty Scottsdale is a great old house that has been converted into a restaurant. Patio looked tempting but we sat inside on the long table and some great brews to go with our dinner. I had a dogfish head ale and my mate had a black and tan. Tasty and delicious!! Dinner for me was my usual at Cornish Pasty, a ruben pasty with corned beef, red cabbage, Russian dressing and a side of fries.  But why the 4 stars? Well. The list of food they ran out of was pretty long. Seems like my vegetarian friends always get the short end of the stick. Plus a few staples always seem to be out.  Now. We got there at 5:30pm so it wasn't like it was closing time. Maybe we need to call ahead at 11am and have some pasties on reserve! None the less, a very tasty dinner with good friends and the service was quick and polite. What's a Pasty?? Go check it out. You'll get a short history lesson on why workers took pasties with them for lunch.",

It's a stark contrast, the Tempe location is dark and divey while this one is very open, lots of windows and natural light with a clean and welcoming feel. The new menu options are a great addition, and the design and layout are slick and eye catching. As much as it irks me to say it, I'd rather drive the ten minutes to this location than go to the one within biking distance of my house. It's like I was dating the Tempe location, but now that I've met her sister in Scottsdale, I think I'm in love.",

I travel a lot and I like when I find places that are not only original but they have great flavors. The staff was nice and the restaurant has an fully open kitchen which was neat. You were able to watch the cooks making pasties right in front of you. They even like to chat it up while they are working which makes you feel less like a spectator and more like a part of the picture.",

One thing to keep in mind is it takes 15-20 min for them to cook one of their fresh pastys so if you are hungry make sure to order a side salad to start to help hold you over.  Their lime pesto house salad dressing was amazing!!  The food was great and the huge outdoor seating will keep us coming back!",

In short, it didn't disappoint and was fantastic as always.  But to be more detailed, the new location is amazing. The remodel/renovation they did on the property is beautiful. Adequate amount of both inside and outside seating. They have several large tables, so it's a great place to come with big groups as you can all fit at the same table and eat, drink, and be able to converse together. The ambiance in general is casual and mellow, but with that unique gastropub vibe. Menu selection is huge, there is truly a pasty for anyone. The beer selection is also great. I really like the fact they have 14, 20, and 32 oz draft sizes, rather than just standard pints. You're bound to find something that you like here, and it's always matched by friendly and helpful waitstaff that makes for an enjoyable experience every time.",

    "text": "We have eaten here twice, and as a family, we have tried seven different pasties.  The pasties are delicious and substantial.  One pasty is more than enough food for an average person, and for some, it would even leave some leftovers for the following day.  The pasties deserve a 5 Star Rating.  I would highly recommend eating here, and if the pasty filling sounds appetizing to you, you will probably love it.  The only reason that I am holding back the final star is because the side dishes are truly awful.  We tried both soups, the potato leek soup was so salty it was inedible.  The underlying flavor profile was less-than-desirable as well.  Even if the cook had been less heavy-handed with the salt (it tasted like somebody was playing a practical joke because the amount of salt in the soup was ridiculous), it still wouldn't have been something I would order again.    The walnut spinach soup was not salty, but it lacked one thing - flavor.  It reminded me of Gerber's bottled mush that we used to feed our poor unsuspecting babies before they were ready for solid food.  And finally, the cole slaw.  The cole slaw was some of the blandest, nondescript cole slaw that I have ever experienced.  The only flavor came from crunching on a hunk of onion that didn't really add flavor as much as it just put the nail in the coffin of my side order choices.  Bottom line - eat here; the pasties are wonderful.  But, don't eat any of the sides.  Mind you, I didn't try all of the sides.  But, based on my experience with three of them, I will never try another one again.  They clearly do pasties well, and that is how they have garnered the success necessary to expand to various locations in the valley.  For the side orders, in my opinion, they should start all over again and change their offerings entirely.  Or, just streamline the menu, ditch the sides altogether, and concentrate on what they do well, extremely well actually - pasties.  Order the pasties; you will LOVE them.  Order the sides at your own risk; remember, you have been warned.",

As I've mentioned before, I'm a big fan of the veggie options because they use great tasting meat substitute that is such a treat to have at a restaurant.  I eat meat, but these veggie options taste nearly the same.  Some of my favorites are the spicy asiago chicken, spicy bbq chicken and salmon.  The soups are also delicious!",

I'm always combing Yelp for the original restaurant that will catch my attention when I visit somewhere new. I found the perfect restaurant in the Cornish Pasty Company! We walked over after looking at some art in Old Scottsdale. The patio setting was perfect for hanging out on and having a cold beer. Their beer selection was impressive and the waitstaff super friendly and cool. The food is absolutely amazing! I tell you I don't know how they do it! The pasty is an art if you've ever had one. The key is the balance of the ingredients and that they are perfectly cooked but most importantly the crust has to be crisp on the outside and soft inside. I will say these were as perfect as they come. The portions were hearty and I would have eaten two if I could have! I highly recommend going with the traditional Oggie or Veggie Oggie it's your first time.",

So when we found ourselves in this area around dinnertime we had to give it a try. I had a pastie with chicken, potatoes, and alfredo sauce, and hubs had one with chicken vindaloo. They were both fantastic, especially for non-traditional pasty fillings. I've had worse chicken vindaloo at some Indian restaurants. We also ordered a Scotch egg and potato leek soup, which were both excellent and exactly what I would have expected. Portions were generous- we both had enough to take half home. I also had a sour beer, which I've never had before, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it since I'm not really a beer person. The decor was rustic but cozy and even on a Friday evening the service inside was friendly and the place was non-crowded. Parking wasn't the greatest and we ended up down the street, but that is the case pretty much anywhere in downtown Scottsdale. Overall, this was an awesome treat and we'll keep it in mind when we're on this side of town.",

    "text": "I just finished watching a volleyball game on a Sunday afternoon and was thinking of what to eat near the end of the game. I was hankering for something new and different so looking through my bookmarked locations on my Yelp app,  I remembered how I've been thinking about visiting the Cornish Pasty for some time now. I decided to call my order in with the intention of easily picking it up and heading straight home afterwards. The voice on the other end of the phone let me know that my order would be ready in 20 or 30 minutes. I can't remember exactly. I didn't have a difficult time locating it although it's not exactly in the middle of the more high-traffic pedestrian areas of Old Town Scottsdale. When I first arrived, I noticed the parking lot wasn't huge, although, there were plenty of areas to park within the area. I found a separate parking lot a block away. Out of curiosity and just not being familiar with the area, I walked around the Cornish Pasty before I found the main doors. You'll find seating both outside and inside. There weren't anyone outside at the time and not a lot inside. That's what happens on a late Sunday afternoon in early September. The inside was pretty dark. It was too dark for my taste, but I loved the wooden tables and benches. It gives it a welcoming, unpretentious and casual vibe. The outside would be a great place to sit when the weather's cooler and you need a spot to hang out at after spending time in Old Town. My visit was short, but the staff inside was very welcoming and my order was ready for me. I ordered The Pilgrim and the Lovely Bit a Salmon. I first had The Pilgrim as soon as I got home and totally savored it. I completely forgot that it came with some cranberry sauce and gravy so I actually ate it without them, but I still loved it. Later that evening for dinner, I had the Little Bit a Salmon and equally loved that too. I really should have saved my second pasty for the following day because these pasties are very filling. I think of them as comfort good. A nice warm pasty would go really well sitting outside at the Cornish Pasty during cooler weather and after finishing an event like a game.   I was flip-flopping between 4 and 5 stars with my rating of Cornish Pasty; after all, I've only visited once as I type this review and it was only to pick up food. I'll go ahead and give it the benefit of the doubt since nothing really bad sticks out in my head regarding my one visit. I feel pretty confident the 5 stars will hold after many other visits. I look forward to those visits during the next few months.",

After waiting 15 minutes to order drinks, we finally had someone take the order. Fast forward 10 minutes, we're informed they're out of 2 of the drinks we ordered. Alright. Now we're cold and don't have our drinks. Let's order food! It's then that we're informed, almost a half hour into being there, that they are \"out of most of their pasty's\". We figure let's see if they happen to have any of the pasty's we wanted...nope. Out of every. Single. One. Nobody bothered to tell us any of this prior to sitting down, or even when we were first greeted. I will not be back, it was an embarrassing place to take my group and a terrible example of customer service. We had to tell a group that came in after us that they were out of the one thing they serve, as nobody had bothered to tell them either.",

The service is always phenomenal - friendly, smart, and on the ball.  The food - unique and very satisfying.  There is probably something here for nearly everyone.  It is just a really comfortable, happy place to be.  Even the desserts are pretty darn yummy.  My favorite thing is to sit on the patio, on lovely AZ afternoon, stuffing my face, and enjoying the scenery.",

I have not found them in very many places if at all, so when I saw this place I had to go. They really know their stuff. The pasties were delicious, the atmosphere was fantastic, and the price was not outrageous either. We partnered them with some of the great beer selection that was available and the evening was wonderful. I highly recommend the Cornish Pasty Company.",

The food was delicious and I left feeling satisfied without feeling overly full. I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often! Make sure to try their version of the moscow mule!",

    "text": "A hearty meal, and a decent beer selection.  First time here, Wednesday last week. We got a scotch egg, and split a bangers and mash pasty. Im no authority on english cuisine,  but it was all delicious,  and if split, enough for two and reasonably priced.  Although I've only had the \"traditional offerings\" (bangers and mash, scotch egg, and Sheppard's pie), some of the other offerings that blend english cuisine with other nationalities dishes sound positively untenable: mexican pasty? Chicken Alfredo (pasty)? Maybe I'm just not adventurous enough. The vibe is also a little confused, like a mill ave establishment that has snuck into old town Scottsdale. Strangely,  I think I would give it another star if it would just choose what it is - a communal tabled English drinking bar for out-of-towners, or a hipster hangout with a slightly grubby feeling; and go with it. I'll go back, and try to determine if it's a good fit for me and boys slugging beers and eating unhealthily,  or for the wife, and kids on a school night. It might work as either.",

We started out with a couple Moscow mules (made with ginger beer- not ginger ale) and the parliament wings- both hit the perfect spot and were amazing!        My friend was nursing a hangover and so she ordered the \"royale with cheese\" which is basically a cheeseburger & french fries wrapped in pastry dough- she loved it (I'm not much of a ground beef fan). I got the \"pilgrim\" which is thanksgiving dinner in a single dish! The first bite blew my mind, it was so flavorful and savory I was in love immediately! I tried the accompanying gravy, but it was salty and took away from the perfect combination of flavors. I tried the cranberry sauce for the next bite, it was good- but the pasty is really just perfect on its own- so I only used the cranberry sauce for the \"crust\" of the pasty.  The good was amazing, definitely not \"healthy\" but I feel ok with every delicious calorie I consumed and will definitely be back!!!",

We had our after-wedding brunch here yesterday, as my now husband is British and thought it would be a nice touch to introduce the Americans to Cornish Pasties as a farewell treat.  We initially thought we'd only have 20-30 people at brunch as people were flying out that day, but ended up with a healthy crowd of around 60 people! Justin and his team were able to scramble with limited resources and accommodate everyone flawlessly. Not only was the customer service friendly and attentive, but the food was hot, fresh and made to order. Nothing suffered as a result of my off-estimates.   Everyone had a great time- the space is modern and open. We loved the family-style tables and open-air floor plan. The pasties and mimosas were tasty (I had the english breakfast pasty- It brought me right back to England!).   All around a perfect morning and exactly what we were looking for in a after-wedding brunch. Casual but classy, great food, friendly service and very affordable (the hotels nearby wanted to charge us a 1500 set up fee and 30 bucks minimum a head for pastries and fruit only).  Thank you Justin, Ryan and team for a seamless event! I would recommend any stressed-out bride to consider this spot for your brunch event as well.",

I couldn't wrap my brain around the concept for some reason.  I've been quite a few times now and each time I go I try a new pasty and haven't had a bad one yet.  My favorite is a tie between the Reuben and The Shepherd's Pie.  The beer list is extensive if you like beer.  I always go for the Moscow Mule they have to offer (thanks for using Crabbie's ginger beer!).",

We would have ordered two more rounds if we were offered.  Aside from that, we weren't even greeted properly, just dropped two waters off, no menu, then three mins later after asking beer menus, wait, we also need food menus.  Then, he rambled off a List of things they were out of.....Quite a  lot actually.  The food was good, but not great.  We weren't asked at all btw.  Also it took a long time.

I am not much of a red meat eater so I went for the pesto chicken and it was delicious. My favorite part is that each pastie comes with its own sauce that pairs perfectly with the filling.  My sister went with the Shea parts pie and absolutely loved it! She said it made you feel like you were in your grandmas kitchen!   We went for a happy hour on a Friday and we're able to sit outside! The outdoor patio has a lot of room for large parties so don't be afraid to bring all your friends! They had great deals on drinks! I usually go for the Moscow Mule! And they had a really good one! And it's served in the classic copper mug which is always a must for me!   If you are looking for the perfect place to take the family for some tasty comfort food and great service this is the place to go! I hope you enjoy!",

London Mule - a wonderful accompanied to wash down the pie  All the crusts were perfect and this pie lover is in heaven.  The atmosphere was warm and friendly. The staff attentive.

    "text": "My wife introduced me to the Cornish Pasty Co. when she brought home leftovers from the original Tempe location. I had tried the Portobello Chicken and I think the Cajun, neither I was crazy about but my wife had got the Chicken Greek and loved it.  One day we went to Scottsdale Fashion Square and wanted lunch so we went to the location on Goldwater Blvd. I can't remember which I tried first since it's been so long but I now have two favorites -- the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Carne Adovada. Both are very spicy but very good. My wife prefers the Veggie Greek or Chicken Greek but apparently they changed their recipe and added cauliflower which she dislikes. Since the pasties are prepared ahead of time they can't be customized.  The Scottsdale location is my favorite but we've also been to the one in Mesa where we usually get part bake and take back to my in-laws'. We've also been to the Las Vegas location which is located in a nearly abandoned strip mall in a bad part of town. I prefer the Scottsdale location mainly because the inside is nicer than the other locations. I have yet been to either Tempe location or the recently-opened one in downtown Phoenix which isn't too far from work.  The Cornish Pasty Co. is frequently my go-to place if I'm hungry in Scottsdale or Mesa and if you are thinking this place doesn't sound all that interesting, please give them a try because I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

I prefer the original location in Tempe for it's charm, but you can't beat the convenience for either.  Love the food here-simple and delicious.  If you aren't familiar with a Pasty, it's similar to a calzone but the bread is more like a pie crust (think \"hot pockets\" if they had more filling options and they were homemade by Grandma). The prices are fair, a pasty and a drink will run you about $12-$15. One pasty is more than enough for a full meal - I always leave the restaurant with half of mine to take home and it makes a fine reheated lunch.  I wish they had few more non-alcoholic and signature cocktail drink options, but that isn't a huge deal.  There is a full bar, so you can probably request a tailor made drink.  I am not that creative with drink ordering, so I like to see ideas right there on the menu.  Service and quick seating has never been an issue.  Parking is limited though.",

    "text": "An Interesting Experience In A Pleasant Setting  I had noticed the Cornish Pasty Co. when it first opened, and made a mental note to try it sometime. I especially loved the setting, and the bar open to the outside called my name. When I finally visited recently, I really loved just sitting there people watching. The service was friendly and prompt and I had a been in front of me in no time at all.   Because I was completely unfamiliar with Pasties, I wasn't quite sure what to expect in terms of the flavor or texture. I ordered the Oggie (the traditional pasty) with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga because it seemed like a good place to start.   When my pasty came, is was golden brown, and piping hot. (a good way to start) I enjoyed my first bite of the crust, but from that point forward was disappointed. I think that I had built my expectations up too much, and that this style of food is just not what I enjoy. It was probably completely authentic and correct. I was left flat in terms of flavor, and wished that I had instead ordered something less traditional and more juicy and savory. I did not find that the gravy really helped much and ended up adding quite a bit of salt and pepper to encourage myself to consume my pasty.   I gave the Cornish Pasty Co 4 stars because I believe that they deliver what they say they will deliver and they deserve the benefit of the doubt. It just didn't suit me. They deserve points as well for the excellent service and marvelous, fun, setting.  I also really enjoyed the beer recommended to me by the bartender.",

The pastry was light and flakey. Overall it was good, but I would try a different one next time.   The chips were kind of gross. I was told the garlic was good, but nothing like traditional garlic fries. It smelt heavily of garlic but had zero garlic taste. Would recommend a different side.

    "text": "Finally, I have completed my trio of visits of all the Cornish Patsy's in town!!  And guess what, yet another 5 star from me!!  I have to admit, I truly believe that Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite restaurants here in Phx, and just about everywhere else. We are so lucky to have a restaurant like this in the valley. Maybe with my support I can persuade them to come to the North West Valley.....please.lol  Ok each Cornish I have visited are have the same food, but total different vibe. The Tempe one is very dark and grungy. Black walls will do that. Mesa has almost a church feel, with a bit of French corder in it. Weird in their own ways.   The Scottsdale location is made from 2 restored houses. A lot cleaner looking than the others yet has a lot of charm. The first thing I liked is how large the patio is. With connecting the two houses it's like 1 giant patio with a wrap around porch. We came on a perfect spring night and sat outside.   Service was great..for the food I had the Cajan chicken, wife had the Mexican, friend had peppered steak. We liked them all, but the least liked was the Mexican, probably wouldn't order that one again. My ultimate favorite pasty is the Meat and Cheese. In fact my friend from Austin that came in to see me wants to go back here on way to the airport and I'm already craving what I'm going to order!! Ha  Oh if no one knows what pasty's are, they are basically a hot pocket on steroids! But made with all natural and fresh ingredients and a flakey crust. Amazing. That all I have left to say.",

Even though this is in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, where douches run amok, this is the location to visit. It's built into two houses. They have a giant bar that also stretches to its patio seating.   The food is top notch. Can't go wrong with The Mexican or Cajun Chicken. What's even better is that they have vegetarian options for their traditional meat pasties. Really can't tell the difference between the two.   Really enjoy the English spirit they have here. Also can't hurt that they have Strongbow.",

The concept for 90% of the menu is the same...essentially a gourmet \"hot pocket\" type baked sandwich with a flaky croissant-like crust stuffed with a wide selection of fillings for different (mostly savory) flavor profiles.The vibe of the restaurant is very \"old pub\" with wooden bench seating and dim lighting, but they also have a fantastic patio/outdoor bar area.  Cornish Pasty is one of those places with something for everyone. I really appreciate that one entire side of the menu is dedicated to vegan and vegetarian menu items; the spicy asiago is one of my favorites! The soups and desserts are are also equally delicious, and it's always hard to pass up a banoffee pie or caramel apple pasty for dessert.",

It was definitely worth it, there were plenty of options that were vegetarian and even vegan friendly.   There was a group of us, so we had to wait to be seated until we all arrived. That was not that atypical so we weren't shocked when they asked us to sit at the bar and grab a drink.  The bartender was very friendly, and made a pretty good Mule. Maybe I'm spoiled, but I really like my mules served and a chilled metal container... The glass jug wasn't quite doing it for me. Especially since we sat outside it got warm quick.   Once we set down at the table, the mediocre service really kicked in. It took almost 15 minutes to even get greeted, and then the server appeared to be in a rush the entire time.    For dinner I ordered a Greek salad to start, a vegetarian pot pie pasty, and a broccoli and cauliflower cheese bake on the side.  No, of course I did not finish it all, but I wanted to have a little taste of a few things instead of just one pasty. Everything was very good. I was so excited to see that they serve quorn in their pasty's. It is my favorite vegetarian meat substitute, because it is not sit based.  Overall, despite the week service I definitely think will be back. It was a great selection, good portions and a really neat atmosphere. Great for groups.",

Love the theme.  Didn't try anything from the bar because I don't drink.  The meatballs were fantastic, great big bangs of flavor in each bite.  I wasn't fond of the Shepard's Pie, but I think that wasn't a great choice on my part.  Should've went with something else.  Garlic Mashed Potatoes were good, as were the Oven Chips.  Wish there was one of these in LA, as I would definitely be back to try more items.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale or Phoenix, will definitely be back to try it again.",

    "text": "Went here last night after attending the Jonathan Kellerman book signing at the Poisoned Pen (about 50 yards up the road). The place is pretty dimly lit on the inside. We were greeted immediately and advised that we could sit pretty much anywhere. Sat and got our menus; square metal sheets which were chipped and scratched up so much that it was very difficult to read the items. I scanned through the pasties but as soon as I saw \"lamb vindaloo\" I quit looking. Love lamb, love vindaloo. I ordered that along with a side of garlic mash. The kid had tandoori wings and the wife ordered the chicken pesto pasty.  Food took maybe 10-15 mins to come out. Mine was delicious. However, no sign of the garlic mash. I asked about it five mins later after determining that they'd likely forgotten about it and it's True, they had - not surprising, I suppose, considering that our order was taken down mentally (ie no pad and pencil - hint to the owners, no matter how good a server's memory is, orders on paper are mandatory for any restaurant). They apologized and asked if I still wanted to wait for it. I said yes. Finished my meal and had one or two of the wings, then out came the garlic mash. Also very tasty and covered in a layer of melted cheese.  All up a solid three stars, great tasting, good service, and they comped me the mash since it came out after I'd already finished my meal. The pasties could be a little larger for the price though. One thing I learned is that dipping carrot sticks in cheesy mash is actually pretty good! We'll come back for sure, I'm definitely wanting to try a few more of the pasties.",

If actually looked watered down (I didn't want to complain because the girl was young & it was busy) also I think because it's more of a beer bar then a liquor bar. It did the job. Alcohol is alcohol and works the same but I do love me a legit old fashion. Husband was not too impressed with his portebello chicken pie pastry but I liked mine!!! The fries were taking about 1hr... the server gave us a unexpected discount because we waited so long so that was kind of him.   It gets busy! We sat at the bar. The guy up in front who helped us signed in for our table was pretty nice. We sat at the bar and asked for a table in case we couldn't get food at the bar. Prob about 45 mins later, he actually came back looking for us, asking if we wanted our spot still.   If you are a pie person and want a hearty comfort piece of crusted pie pastry, come here and try it. There were so many options! Next time, I'll come for a beer or wine instead.",

The patio is lovely and the interior is equally as nice. The service was upbeat and friendly as well as fast!  Started with the scotch Egg, a good size $5 appetizer, with that perfectly toasted bread crumb outer layer and savory sausage that encased the egg ... one of the best I've had ... no I'm sure it was the best ever! Came with a brown mustard dipping sauce, super yum!  I ordered the lamb Sheppard pie Pasty and it was huge! I brought the other half to my other half and he loved it! The red wine sauce that accompanied the Pasty was excellent as well.  I ended with my favorite dessert the sticky toffee pudding with salted caramel so decadent and filling especially with the vanilla ice cream. The toffee pudding is served in a mini cast iron skillet and as with any cast iron you must know what you're doing or your dish will burn ( or look burnt yuck!) Not this pudding though, it was toasty on the outside and moist on the inside. The extra salted caramel to top it with sealed the deal!  If you're in Old Town Scottsdale and you want to pass on the typical bar food please check this 5 star Brit pub! Cheers!",

It was delicious - baked to a perfect golden brown. The portion size was fairly large and I definitely enjoyed the generous helping of meat in the pasty. Given the portion size, the price was reasonable. Pasties come by itself, but sides are available as additional orders. As I was not that hungry, I elected to just have the pasty.  Good place for some comfort food.",

The last visit, we sat at the counter and watched the kitchen staff make the pasties. They worked hard, took obvious care to get everything 'right' (weighing, measuring, etc to ensure consistency) and obviously got along well as a team - which I think leads to a better experience overall. They also offered a lot of suggestions and demonstrated a good understanding of the menu.",

I'm a midwestern raised kind of girl who's developed a pretty complicated palate since moving to AZ.   I can appreciate a meal that sticks to your ribs.  It's heavy yet so satisfyingly good.  Choose your filling... steak, chicken, veggies and their amazing combinations of sauces and cheeses.  The Royale with Cheese was my first pasty experience with garlic and herb red potatoes.  It was love at first bite!!    I like the location of this restaurant right on Goldwater... beautiful open air design.  The moscow mules are delicious.  A recent try was the Scottish eggs!!!  TRY them!  The mustard dipping sauce is perfect. The staff is always polite and very attentive.  Doesn't matter if you are on the patio or seated inside they are present and happy to serve you.",

It was delicious not too salty. The veggies were abundant and cooked just right. The crust stayed nice and flaky not soggy at all.  The dipping sauce was a nice compliment to the pasty. I will definitely come back.",

When we received our food, all the Pastys that had potatoes in them were undercooked. The potatoes were brown, not white in color and where crunchy like they were raw. What made it worse is the manager said they knew they were undercooked. We took the other half of those Pastys home and cooked then another 30 minutes to no avail. They were horrible.   Today, we came back for the first time since our last bad experience and it wasn't much better. We sat on the patio and after several minutes had to go to find someone to help us. When they finally came they told us they are out of several staple items. So we found something else. A couple minutes later the waitress came back and said they were out of those too. We decided to leave and go somewhere else.   I'm not sure what's changed or going on there but they need to get their stuff together.",

Very cozy cute comfortable atmosphere. We were waited on quickly. We got our drinks and I thought I should have got a appetizer   But I'm glad I didn't. My pasty was so big I could only eat half. My husband got the  Royale pasty. But he didn't have it with the thousand island sauce he asked for the wine sauce, which was very good! He loved it so much he ordered 2 to go!! We also ordered a Carmel Apple pasty for dessert later at home!!   We can't wait to go back and try the other pasties ! So many wonderful choices. Our server was a young blonde, she was friendly and always there when we needed anything! .",

It was convenient to be able to take it home and pop it in the oven and have a hot and fresh pasty to eat.

To start the meatballs are excellent and the \"chips\" are a great addition to any meal. Also, the tomato soup is an amazing starter or a light meal.   I've had the Italian, Philly, and Piligram Cornish and felt different about each one. The philly was a bust because I hate onion and you can't substitute on any Cornish. The piligram was decent but I think I was to excited for it and then was a bit let down. The ITALIAN is AMAZING!!",

They have a great selection of beer and if you don't know what a pasty is, then you should probably go there now and try it out.   I have been on the lovely bit of salmon for a while now and love the tomato soup too. My gf always goes for the mashed potatoes which I admit are pretty awesome too.   Check it out",

I was there because of my boyfriend's birthday party and they took good care of us, also with the birthday cake brought at the end of the dinner...(perfect timing) 3) the prices are good, not too expensive and not to cheap.  Concluding, if you want to try an English place, this is the one you're looking for! :)",

    "text": "Preface: this review is for the last couple of months visits at this location. The past three years as a weekly customer have been fine up until now.   In the past two months, it appears they have gone through some staffing changes. The same people aren't around anymore, one of the bartenders moved to a different location, and the new wait staff is very non-attentive. The tables and bar have been dirty each time I went in. Employees spend more time talking to each other than handling customers.   The food has been poor and inconsistent. In the last three visits alone, my pasties have been either overcooked or undercooked. On the occasion they were undercooked, the dough wasn't fully baked. I complained, and was brought back the same exact pasty, but now had sat in an oven for twenty more minutes and was overcooked.   The other issue is that they often are now \"out of\" items on the menu. On four separate occasions, I tried to order certain pasties only to be told that they were out of them. One time I had to go through five different choices to find one I liked that they actually had available, until I had to ask for a list of what they even had. How does this happen, I ask? It seems to me that the pasties are pre-made at a certain point in the week, frozen, and then baked to order. But if they run out, they run out until they make more. How can you be out of basic menu items like chicken pot pie? It doesn't make a lot of sense.   I'd avoid this location until they get their priorities back in line and make some serious changes. Management should take a good look at what is actually happening here and fix the issues at hand.   To the owner, if you read these reviews: I'd love an explanation of what is going on here. I've come to this location weekly since it opened and now don't have any reason to keep going.",

    "text": "Cornish Pasties have been a personal favorite of mine since a visit to Bath, UK a few years ago. Usually, enjoyment of pasties is highly selective to the individual: however, Cornish Pasty Co. offers a massive selection of options friendly to anyone. The difficulty is: finding the right one for your taste. Here is a rundown of the ones I've tried:   Bangers and Mash: Pros-hearty, heavy, gravy-filled meaty goodness. Cons- overloaded with \"mash\" (mashed potatoes).   Chicken Tikka Masala: Pros- a great one to try for those tired of the meat-overload. Great spicy/mild flavor profile. Cons- sauce is a bit sweet, chunks fall out while eating.  The Royale with Cheese: Pros- my personal favorite pasty of all time. Meaty, cheesy, buttery, sweet, savory, EVERYTHING IN ONE. Make sure to get medium with bbq sauce. Cons- too much potato. Kept me asking, \"where's the beef?\"  Cajun Chicken: Pros- if you want meat, this one's the way to go. Overload of nothing but spice-rubbed ham, chicken, and bacon. Cons- not a ton of taste, a bit too much meat for my tastes (and that's hard to do). A bit of red/green pepper, broccoli, or other lighter veggie really would've helped.  For dessert, we went with sticky toffee pudding and B-something pie. Both tasty, nothing amazing. Good way to top off the meaty, buttery meal. The staff was terrific, portions were MASSIVE (), great ambience. Seemed to be aiming for a British pub/eatery style, making it really enjoyable for a hungry party! One of the greatest aspects of the place was the music they were playing! 70s-90s classic/alternative rock, with some modern too! Modest Mouse, Led Zeppelin, Arctic Monkeys, Black Keys, you name it. Definitely heading over to the Vegas location, thanks for the fabulous, memorable, filling meal, Cornish Pasty Co.!",

    "text": "Thought this location in Scottsdale would be snotty and completely different from the one on University.  Well I was wrong.  This location is better, the University one needs some major things fixed, like the fact if it rains it leaks underneath the wall or floor and you will be sitting in a puddle by the end of your meal, or you go to pick up your purse and it will be soaked.  This location has completely the same atmosphere, much more space, and a wonderful outside seating area and bar.  Plus I didn't notice anything that needed fixing yeah!  $4 car bombs yes please!    I've had many of the vegetarian options before, but gotta say the carne adovado is to die for I just can't order anything else now.  I always need the Mexican/Spanish style pastys with chiles, salsa, hot sauce etc.... That I have yet to try a traditional pasty.  I'm sure they are all great and really want and will try the pilgrim next time!    I mean I'm a AZ native I guess home cooked comfort food pasties don't catch my eye, but I will expand my horizons and give a traditional pasty a try.   Ohhhhh...... and my bf loves the cajun chicken which is also amazing.  Oh and don't forget to get a cup of leek soup! Now that is a must have every time now,  its so delicious!  Dreaming of it now!  Good service, some servers always seem glum and never smile but still nice staff.  Takes a while to make a pasty but you can have plenty of beer or car bombs while you wait!",

When we sat down we felt comfortable. The building is English style. Beautiful inside.   The drink menu has a large selection of wines and beers. The beers are 20oz for less than $5! Great prices.   To eat we got pastys of course. I got the one that has a burger in it. This one was great! Very flavorful. And the dipping sauce they send out helps the pasty be less dry. So it's i just perfect. My bf got the oggie or the original one. He liked his as well but he liked mine better. I think because it was cheesier!!  We also got the home chips with garlic on them. Excellent.   For dessert we got the apple caramel pasty. With the ice cream it was the absolute perfect ending to the meal.   This is the perfect place for if you are up for some good comfort food and want to fill up. Very unique. Nothing else like it around Scottsdale.   A solid 5 stars from me!",

That said, the location on Goldwater is always consistent, delicious, and affordable.  FOOD: Low price for the great quality you get, and typically one pasty is enough to fill you up, but if you're really hungry get a side or appetizer and you should be good. I've been here probably six times now, always satisfied with what I get and it's always freshly made, out of the oven, piping hot.  SERVER: Most of the time, it's a little slow and lack of attentiveness / refills, but the last time I went it was better than the times before. Still, on average, it lacks a tad bit in this area.  HOSTING: I go here a lot for lunch and it's always pick where you wanna sit or wait for a split second while we pick you a spot. I've been here on a Friday night also and I don't recall there being a long wait or hosts with attitude.  AMBIANCE: Pub-like English tavern feel. Fits with the food and casual yet unique for Arizona, I feel.  Go here and try any of their signature pasties!",

They kept drinks full, food came out very quickly, and it was delicious as usual. I had a vegetarian spicy asiago pasty and loved it. Most of the people in the group hadn't been here before and they all loved it. Not one person didn't seem to like the food. I would never think of getting a salad here with the amazing pasty's but someone did and it actually looked great as well!",

    "text": "It would not be an exaggeration to say that the opening of this Cornish Pasty location has changed my life. I have always been a Cornish Pasty Co. fan for the sheer fact that the food is delicious, satisfying, and extremely reasonably priced. This location has enhanced my Cornish Pasty experience even more, if that's possible.   In all the times I've been here (out of more than 10), I've only had to wait for seating once. The entire space is wide open and seats many more people than the other locations. I've always had good experience with the service- everyone is laid back and genuinely seems to like working there.   Every time I have a visitor from out of town, I bring them or recommend the Cornish Pasty Co. and I have yet to hear negative feedback.  Parking can get a little finicky but I haven't had to worry about it for the most part. I've had luck with a little lot behind the building and if one of the businesses is using that for valet, there is usually decent street parking.",

It's so good heated up the next day too! Their desserts are always comforting and inspired and just the right about of sweetness.  I still dream about a banana pudding I had there years ago.",

The freshest, most awesome tasting bread ever... has to use some real restraint for Pilgrim Pasty was yet to come... Thanksgiving stuffed in a Pasty with some gravy and cranberry's deliciousness!    Christina our server brought some awesomeness to the meal and a great vibe of the Pasty Company!  Thanks for a great meal and great service.",

Fine craft beer selection.  The building itself is perfect!  It would be a 5 star review, but I'm picky about the background music.  Too much Black Sabbath, Foreigner, and Boston played last night.  How about some indie rock, jazz, or classic soul to give the place the classy sounds it deserves.  The food, service, beer, and architecture/decor are A+.",
