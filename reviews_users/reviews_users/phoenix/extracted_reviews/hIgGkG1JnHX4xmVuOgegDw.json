The staff there is so nice and it's always clean.  The only bad thing about going during lunch is that it is on the small side so seating can sometimes be a problem.  They do have outdoor seating though.",

    "text": "Like the review I wrote yesterday, I wish I could give it three and a half stars, but since I can't it gets four. Why?  Well, they basically do one thing and they do it well--cheesesteak. I got one with provolone and raw onions and it was really great--real steak, a little light on the cheese but not too bad, and just the right about of chopped onions. The bread was soft and tasty also, obviously freshly baked. Yes, I know provolone and raw onions is heresy to someone from Philly, but since I'm from Indiana I don't care. Cheese wiz? You can have it. Anyway, with real cheese these things are good. As a bonus, they offer three types of peppers in the condiment bar, which put the place over the top for me. I'll leave it to others to judge the \"genuine\" Philly style sandwich.   Service was also good and friendly, and the place is as clean as anyplace I've been. The only complaint I have is it is a little expensive. I spent a little over $11 for a large sandwich and a coke with no sides. Also, if you don't like cheesesteak you're kind of out of luck. But what they do they do very well. I'll certainly be back. The only reason I would have given it three and a half rather than four stars is because of the price.   And those four and five star reviews I've been writing? I promised myself I would only write about restaurants I have eaten at since I started writing these reviews. I promise when I eat at a bad restaurant I won't mince words! I have a whole bunch in mind, but I want to wait and give them another chance.",

Even though he deceided he wanted to sit on top of the table.   You will see me there again.  *Update*** downgrade from 5 Stars to 3 Stars   We went there a while back and they changed their sweet potato fries!!! I got some to go and started to snack on them in the car. I immediately noticed they were different than the ones I love, so called them. I asked if they changed their fries and he said yes. I asked if it was permanent or they just ran out or something. He said these are the fries from now on.  Until they go back to the old ones I probably wont go there nearly as often. The fries are that big of a deal. :(  2nd Update*** upgrade from 3 to 4 I has been a while and the sweet potato fries are pretty tasty now. And the service is still as good as ever.",

    "text": "Some of the best cheesesteaks i've had. Should of went with the more popular original (steak & cheese whiz), but instead, tried it with my fav, provolone. While the meat and chesse tasted really good, the overall finish was somewhat dry. Probably my only drawback since all my cheesesteak consisted of was bread + steak + provolone cheese. I'm going back because the fries were some of the best I've had. The service was very friendly. My fiance ordered the kids meal (she wanted the grilled cheese) and said it was really good. Portions are right on, a little too much actually. I got the regular and couldnt finish it. But when I go back, I'm going to try the Steak 'wit cheez'.   A- vote.  01/11/2010 UPDATE: I've been back and tried the original (steak with cheese whiz). Oh my! Now THIS is what I'm talking about!!! Best cheesesteak I've ever had outside of Philly.  A+  Also- the employees are still as nice as the 1st time. GREAT service, arguably in the top 3 in all of the Phoenix metro. I've been there 6 times to date and haven't been disappointed.  Also- I must add that their 'fry sauce', whatever mysterious blend of tastebud utopia, is amazing. I don't know what it is, but I love that stuff. Far better than regular ketchup. Also- their fries are ALWAYS cooked to perfection. I've yet to have soggy fries nor old, stale fries.   LOVE THIS PLACE.  (request to owners- if you can, please open up a new location. maybe Tempe Marketplace?? you guys are leaps and bounds better than the Great Steak Escape or whatever they are called).",

    "text": "Ahh cheesesteaks, what a sensitive topic. Well I feel that before I start I have to state that I AM a Philly native. I'm not saying my review/opinion holds more weight than that of others, but basically, it does.   Forefather's is good to go in my book! I tried their \"the original\" and it did bring a slight smile to my face when I bit into it. The shredded style of steak isn't my choice (see my Steve's Prince of Steaks review) but other than that, they've got it down OK. I won't ding them on their not using a certain kind of roll made from Philly local bakery Amoroso's as I don't believe that is a possibility out here.   The only thing that I can say that is a negative about the place is that they are pretty pricey for the amount that you get. However, I too will accept this as things like this are pretty much a novelty here, and I guess I'll have to pay a little bit more for less to remind myself of home in between visits back east.  The fries were OK, and I didn't get to use any of their fry sauce so I can't comment on that.   +1 for the patriotic decor, and another +1 for their tribute to the \"forefather's of cheesesteaks\" display, even though I believe that the big two have become tourist traps and aren't really that great anymore (see SPoS review). Jim's is in the NE very close to Steve's. You \"could\" say that Jim's is Steve's biggest rival, except that Steve's is without peers.",

    "text": "It's Saturday night and I have not eaten much all day.  I had read some reviews about Philly cheesesteaks and was kind of craving one.  I checked around on Yelp and found Forefathers.  So off we went!   We pulled up and walked in, looked at the menu on the wall and ordered.  I had the standard cheessteak with peppers and onions and sweet potato fries.  My daughter had the \"fox\" off the children's menu.  It was chicken strips and fries with a drink.  The young man working the counter was polite and friendly.  We got our drinks and sat down.  There are about 12 tables inside and about 5 outside.  The place was was clean and tidy.  When my order was ready I went to pick it up and the young man asked if there was anything else I needed.  I said no, we were good but when I went back to the table they had forgotten the ranch for my daughter's chicken strips.  She is 7 and very independent so she went up to ger her ranch.  The young man was apologetic and asked and gave her two cups of ranch instead of one.  She was happy.  And she said her meal was yummy.  My cheesesteak was so good.  Great flavor, tendor meat and fresh roll.  And the cheese just oozed out.....yum! The sweet potato fries were great too.  Refillable drinks too.   While we were eating my daughter was looking at the pictures of Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson.  We had a nice little history lesson while we were eating.  She also liked the lighting.  She said it looked like a party.  There were lights draped from the ceiling along with the regular lighting and with the high ceilings it did have a sort of patio feeling.    Being a parent I have probably seen bathrooms in every place we have ever been to, the grocery store, gas station, and restaurants. The restroom here was fantastic.  When I opened the door it was not at all what I expected.  It had nice tile and the faucet had a fancy spikett that turned on automatically when you put your hands under it.  There was a nice smelling soap and lots of paper towels too.  And it smelled nice in there!!  Yes, it smelled nice!  Not like a bathroom at all and it was clean!!    I'm not from Philly but  I know what I like and this was a darn good cheesesteak!  Thank you Forefathers!!",

I was wrong, they have a nice salad menu (that can be modified) and their tomato soup and grilled cheese is fantastic!  I wanted to try the sweet potato fries, but couldn't possibly put one more thing in my stomach.

The service was great and the cheese steaks were done quickly - I got the white American with the extra drizzle of cheese whiz and it was amazing. They have a fridge full of extra peppers which I was tempted to just sit and eat (dipped in their house fry sauce stuff - also amazing). Go here. Eat everything. Thank me later.  Update: had to come back (even though I just ate it yesterday) - came during lunch rush, still super speedy and delicious. Added cheese fries this time and they were also perfect.

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  A very solid cheesesteak joint.  A little pricier than your average steak, but still very good and worth the price.  Standard steak, with onions and wiz.  That's my point of comparison.  The bread here is a liiiiitle too hard, but it's close.  It's chewy and it stands up to the cheese and meat juices.  The meat is well seasoned, tender, and they give you enough wiz.  I'm a sucker for their salad here, mostly because of their house dressing.  I don't know why I love it so much, but the salad alone almost warrants 4 stars for this place. Their fries are fine.  I am not a huge fan of their fry sauce, it's lacking a little something.  But, bonus points to them for putting a couple different types of hot peppers for your steak.  So did the whole Pat's, Geno's, Dalessandro's thing (which are in reverse order of my favorites, still have to try Tony Luke's), so I can't give this place 5 stars.  But it's very good, the place is clean and the staff is friendly and like I said, they don't skimp on the wiz.",

Side note, I came in here one time 15-20 minutes before closing and still got fresh hot food, and the staff was amazing. They didn't try to rush me out nor were they cleaning and shutting down.

I went steak, whiz and onions peppers and shrooms plus fries.  at 12$ that's pushing my lunch price tag.  but the food is arguably worth it.  good steak, little light on the whiz for my liking and a nice firm bread.  the only downside was that by the time I was finishing my lunch the last few bites of bread were completely soaked.    ultimately, if I'm west of the 101 I'd go here for my cheesesteak fix.  for what it's worth, the biggest difference I noticed here was the bread density. definitely more dense and chewier than the Philly place on Alma school.",

    "text": "Four days and maybe seven hours ago, our hunger brought us forth to eat cheesesteak, to try a new restaurant, conceived in Philly, but dedicated to the proposition that not all cheesesteaks are created equal.  We shared a large chicken cheesesteak with everything (onions, bell peppers), and cheese wiz, along with some sweet potato fries.  The chicken cheesesteak came with a good amount of tender chicken, with a lot of flavor.  There is a free-range mini fridge that is stocked with sweet , hot peppers, and fry sauce which is nice so you can customize your order with as many or as little peppers as you want.  While the ingredients were good quality, the cheesesteak as a whole naturally doesn't really compare to any I've had in Philly, but it's good for Arizona!  The sweet potato fries were my favorite part of the meal.  They were excellently cooked with just the right amount of crunch while still tender and sweet inside.  So would our forefathers be impressed by Forefathers?  They probably wouldn't know what a cheesesteak would be, but if they tasted one, I would say they would be!",

This was our first visit, but we thought we give it a south Philly try coming from the Penna area. so yes I do know what a cheese steak should be.  It was good!  Not great ! The place was busy and people were even sitting outside in the heat.   Even though it  was packed the staff was friendly and efficient. The line moved pretty quick.  Our Original Phillys were messy and good.   Our negatives:  The size of the dining area. It was a bit small and crowded today.  The meat was per-cook it take away from the moisture and meat had a little burnt taste. You should make the sandwiches to order ... every order with fresh rib-eye meat \"not the pre cook\" stuff. keep the grill a little lower not burn the meat.  I will try this place again the future to see if anything changes.  The price for two cheese steak, 2-fries, 2 coke was $ 22.00 and change a little steep.  The combo did not include the drinks.",

    "text": "\"Gourmet\"  is used loosely here.  If your meat is all pre-cooked and they just toss it on the grill to warm it up, can you really say you're gourmet? I'm pretty sure that's what Mickey- D's does, and no one is claiming they're gourmet.  I could probably get over that fact if it weren't for a horrible interaction I had with one of the employees regarding their bread.  When walking into Forefathers, they have a sign declaring that what makes the sandwiches they serve better than any other is the bread.  Turns out, they don't make the bread in the store.  Ok, I can get on board with using a local bakery to make your bread.  What I cannot get on board with is the fact that they have no idea what is in the bread they serve, nor do they have any interest at all in finding out!   My allergies to dairy and eggs make it difficult to find bread that I can eat.  When I asked the lady at the register if their bread had dairy or eggs she said she didn't know and couldn't find out.  Ok, I'll have a salad and I'm fine with that.  The issue came when I suggested that she may want to ask the bakery next time she talked to them as food allergies are becoming more common.  She said no she didn't think she would do that and that I was the only one who had ever asked.  WRONG answer! It is an insult to gourmet eateries everywhere to not know exactly what is in everything you serve.  If the bread is really what makes the sandwich, why don't you know what's in it.  I, for one, will not be returning.",

The side salad was fresh, the fries crispy, and they offer a bevy of free sweet bell pepper, cherry peppers, jalapenos, or fry sauce. Our household believes the best thing about the place were the cheese steaks, yummy and satisfying.",

Fresh home made rolls, high quality beef or chicken, quality cheeses make an amazing sandwich, and the fries, oh my goodness soooo good, especially the sweet Potato.  The fry sauce is a must but if you like ranch, ask  for some on the side, hause made and best on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fplanet.no&s=2f35e43dbcd2e8303f739fa9f0a75f13dc1b40631ee7b2d449cb125363976f6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">planet.no</a> joke-I would have it as my drink if I could afford the calories.

The best thing was the sweet potato fries that I didn't even ordered haha. Nothing will beat Philly's Best in Socal.",

The atmosphere and decor inside is very modern and clean. Very welcoming and comfortable. The guy who took our order was super friendly and helpful. The food came out fast and they offer sides like try sauce and peppers out in the dining area so you can go back for more at any time. The food was delicious! Everything was hot and cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back every time we are in the area (it is less than a mile from Ikea).",

This place is in a strip mall and has a modern look about it, not sure what the Cow pictures have to do about our forefathers though. The cheesesteaks were awesome and offered all the choices of cheeses and buns were soft. I will be back unless we get a better place here in the Gilbert area.",

I always get the one with cheese whiz and it's to die for. They always put just the right amount of cheese to where it's not overwhelming.   Finally, the bun is so fresh and fluffy it's the perfect blanket for the aforementioned deliciousness. They come with grilled onion but I personally skip.

It usually turns out to be a hot roast beef sandwich with kraft singles.   Alas, a coworker told me about Forefathers, to which my skepticism stayed high, that is until I walked in. There on the wall was a picture of Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's. And in that moment, I understood the name.   With a twinge in my heart for my beloved city, although I love Phoenix, it will never compare to Philadelphia. I walked to order and saw cheez wiz on the menu board. Impressive thus far, but signs and menu boards do not a cheesesteak make.   I ordered.  I smelled the onions.  I saw the rolls on the counter. I saw an order that looked like \"the best cheesesteak outside of Philly. No really!  Trust me.\"  I ate.  I cried. (Ok, not really but...)  Pros: Thinly chopped steaks, not sliced beef. If you don't know the difference, then F YOU.   Chucks of onions, not sliced. Cheez wiz!    Cons: Not enough salt.  Good rolls. Not Amoroso or Sarcone, but good.   Thanks, Forefathers.

I always get the phili original w/ grilled onions, you know the works. The prices are a little high, from what I recall, 8$ for a 6 inch, and I always get fries because their fry sauce is simply amazing, so Ill spend around $13 if I get the 6 inch meal which comes with fries and a drink. Their condiments are all fresh tasting (banana peppers, etc) and atmosphere and decor is modern looking.   Staff is very friendly and service is quick. I highly recommend checking this place out if you dont mind paying a little on the expensive end for cheesesteaks.",

Additionally during their busiest time they allow patrons who are no longer eating to just hang out while a line starts to form for those waiting for a table to open. We didn't have time to wait so we were forced outside in the 110 heat. No misters, no outdoor fans. We were sweating horribly and both of us just scarfed down our food just so we could get back into our air conditioned car. We didn't enjoy it at all. Either get a larger establishment or ask people to not hog tables when they're clearly done and its the busiest part of the day. Awful experience.",

    "text": "Is it True that I haven't reviewed Forefathers yet? I am in serious disbelief. Forefathers is like my favorite thing ever ever ever. For starters, the service is so wonderful here. It is family owned, so it definitely has a warm, inviting feel to it. You can watch them cook your sandwich right by the register, and it seems they are always talking with each other, laughing, and having a great time. From pure speculation, I feel like the family that owns it really enjoy each others' company. But I digress.  Their cheesesteak sandwiches are amazing. Melt in your mouth, packed with flavor, fresh and hot off the grill amazing. The words escape me for how unbelievably delicious their sandwiches are. They are messy in the best kind of way - I don't even care how silly I look with greasy flavor dripping off of my elbow. Ten stars for the sandwiches. Fifteen stars for the sandwiches. A million stars for the sandwiches!  The decor is also really great here. Lots of patriotism up in that joint. But seriously, try these guys out. I promise you it will be one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat.",

I was introduced to this place many years ago when I worked in the area and would come by periodically for lunch. As much as I love cheesesteaks, man cannot live on cheesesteak alone... though a good argument could be made that a cheesesteak is a balanced meal: meat, dairy (cheese), grain (bread) and veggies (peppers). Maybe get a salad and skip the fries to balance it out a little more :)  I am not from Philly, nor do I know what a \"real\" Philly steak looks like, but these guys know how to make a grilled shaved steak sandwich. The beef is cooked perfectly (a good amount of \"drip,\" not dried out) and the bread is really fresh. Even if I were thinking about cutting back on carbs, I'd have to make an exception for their bread. The portions are large enough that the \"regular\" sandwich is more than I really need to eat, but not so much that I have leftovers.   I got my sandwich with Provolone this time. It was OK. I usually get the Whiz and recommend that with peppers and mushrooms. Whatever you do, don't leave the cheese off; that's an abomination.   :D",

My husband got beef steak, cheese wiz, mushrooms, sweet peppers, and onions with a side of buffalo sauce. They were so juicy and fresh, and great flavor. They didn't last long! We also got the kettle chips, me sea salt and him salt and vinegar and they were some of the best kettle chips we have had! The buffalo sauce was extremely well balanced, hot and tasty. We are so mad at ourselves for not finding this place sooner! Love it!!!",

I love a good smile and someone willing to help. After talking a few minutes I chose my cheesesteak. Let me tell you although it looked basic it was the best tasting cheesesteak I've ever had. The bun was slightly toasted and didn't get soggy which is a big deal to me. The onions didn't over power it either . Perfect. My only wish is that they'd make a permanent location in the west valley so we could enjoy these more often.",

Or if my wife wants to visit IKEA, I say 'screw the meatballs, we're going to Forefathers!' This place has ridiculously good tasting food, plain and simple. Anyone I have recommended it to has come away a die hard fan. I have had nearly every thing they offer and could not pick a favorite off the menu, everything is amazing. The only thing I have not tried is the chicken because 'why would I get chicken at a philly cheese steak place??' But most of my friends who have had it say it is equally amazing. Simply put, if you enjoy eating animals, then you owe it to yourself to try eating here, your tastebuds will not regret it.",

But today i was VERY impressed at the patience and professionalism the staff (might I add very young staff) demonstrated!! There was a large group (20+) of adults and young children. While the parents socialized and allowed their children to treat the entire establishment like a McPlayPlace (jumping and running along the benches, rolling a skate board on the floor, yelling, screaming, etc.) the staff remained incredibly professional and did not let any frustrations hinder the world class service and cleanliness!! They dodged children to make sure their soda machine was spotless, the condiment fridge was full, their paper towel rolls were loaded! I was SO impressed! I was frustrated with the lack of parenting and blatant disrespect for property and other people that was displayed, but,  the staff blew me away with their good attitudes! This truly speaks volumes of these individuals!!!",

The owner/manager that was runni g the table was the worst representative as he proceeded to shamelessly plug the restaurant and how the food was \"way better than everyone else doing it\". Not only did he overly hype the lacklustre food, but he tried to persuade us to coerce the friend driving to get out and buy something. Rude, pushy and annoying. The food was disappointing as well. The $10 buys a soggy breaded 7\" cheesesteak and lukewarm/stale waffle cut chips that may have been ok fresh. Pro tip: Don't plug the high quality of your cheesesteaks if you still feel the need to attempt to convince people the cheez wiz is the best one and list it as your special.",

The meat is cooked well , the bread is not over fully and they have the wiz option which if you are from back east is a must. The staff seem quite friendly and the place is clean and spacious . I should of taken a picture because once again , they do not slack on the meat. This would be my favorite spot but Frank's down in Tucson just has number one az cheese steak hands down . I spent about 16 bucks for cheese steak (they include mushroom bonus points) and cheesy fries (not a ton fries but come on the steaks are big enough meal). They threw in free drink so bonus points again.   I would recommend stopping by the staff may be a bunch of kids but the steaks are all grown.",

When served, it looked like there was a ton of meat, but as soon as I took a bite, I realized that half of it was bread and the sandwich, in fact, had no problem closing.  I felt like there wasnt enough cheese on mine, but my boyfriend complained he had too much, a matter of perspective I suppose.  Or inconsistency.  Prices were average for a philly cheesesteak ($8.30 for a regular).  I'm not from Philly so I can't weigh in on whether it's authentic but I doubt I'll be back.",

The bread is soft and chewy, the sauce is perfection, couple all of that with quality chicken, grilled onions, celery and green peppers, you have yourself a work of art.  The side salad with the fresh made house vinaigrette is a perfect side to the sandwich.  I make sure to come to forefathers a couple times per month.",

I ordered a cheesesteak with onions and mushrooms. I also got a side of fries and my friend got a chicken cheesesteak...  I really wanted to like this place because of the positive reviews. I had such a wonderful experience there, but my cheesesteak was so bland -- almost like they forgot to put salt and pepper on it.  My friend's chicken cheesesteak was, according to her, \"a huge salt lick\". I think I'd rather have taken the salt lick over the non salty food I had. Even the mushrooms and onions lacked flavor...and the swiss cheese was bland as well.  I'm going to give this place another shot...but for now it's just ok. The fries made me happy enough to give them 3 stars.",

So, they dragged me in there. I could not bring myself to order fat dripping and CheezeWiz smothered real Cheese Steak so i ordered chicken one instead. It was BORING, dry and uninteresting. My granny (One from mom's side who can not cook) could make it way better.  So, while i honestly can not evaluate their main product - Cheese Steak,  whatever i got kinda suxed!  They do draw big crowds now and sometime there is no place to seat, or at least that is what guys from work telling me. But whataver...  \"I no like\"",

    "text": "Being from Philly, I have made it a point to try every \"authentic\" Philly cheesesteak place I've come across since moving to AZ in 1982.  Since Longhitano's in Tempe closed close to a decade ago, every new place has fallen so short it's sad, really.  Not enough meat, rolls all wrong, meat TASTES wrong ...   Then my friend Brian, also a Philly native, came to town from L.A.  I decided we needed to try Forefathers.  We went ... we ate ... we ascended to a level of bliss not known in forever.  THESE are AUTHENTIC Philly cheesesteaks.  Don't have to pay for double meat, you can actually get a \"wit wiz\" ... AND a pizza cheesesteak.  OMG, sheer delight!  Brian had the cheese fries as well and they were so yum.  And the staff behind the counter were just AWESOME.  When we went to thank them for the amazing meal, they all cheered that they passed muster with us.  Honestly, anyone who did not grow up partaking of the wonders of real Philly cheesesteaks just cannot appreciate the awesomeness of Forefathers.  We liked it so much we are going back again on Sunday before Bri goes back to L.A.  He posted on his facebook page, and I quote \"Who'd have thunk that Phoenix would have the most authentic cheesesteak I've had since leaving Philly?\"  My ONLY beef (no pun intended) with Forefathers is that they have Hunts ketchup (which tastes awful IMHO) instead of Heinz.  Yes I know, some people consider ketchup on a cheesesteak sacreligious but that's how I grew up.  Sunday I'll try a pizza cheesesteak so it won't matter ;)  Oh, and try the homemade chocolate chip cookies ... oh sooooo good!",

The cashier said, \"Good choice; the pizza cheesesteak is great!\"    And I made the joke, \"I'm starving...so it'd better be.\"  And the cashier told me that if I didn't enjoy it, he would make me something else.  That was good customer service...but it got better.  After a couple of minutes of eating, the cashier walked by to ask me if the sandwich was as good as he said it was.

Forefathers is not going to beat any of these places, but it is a very nice copy of the originals. The meat is similar but they chop it up into smaller pieces here. Also they put the wiz on the bun and on top so there is good cheese to meat ratio happening. The bun could be more \"crusty\" for my liking but it did the job. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to get a good cheesesteak but it will not be the same as the Great ones.",

I'm not a big fan of mushrooms, onions, & peppers on my sandwich so I figured to add lettuce & tomatoes... yeah, they don't have that as an option and that's what I was looking for to add to my sandwich.   Decided to go with American Cheese and just steak and asked what else I could add to my sandwich given that they didn't have tomatoes and lettuce. I ended up adding their personalize fry sauce to give it some 'flair'.   Lunch ran me $13 for a regular sandwich regular fries and a drink.  Food was ready quickly and I was very much surprised at the taste and quality of the meat along with the bread!!! Fries were good too and the nice thing is they have condiments like fry sauce, variety of peppers and other items that you can grab from the fridge at the condiment station.  My only downside was i couldn't add lettuce and tomatoes, but I do understand for my steak and cheese guru's that is not the right thing to add... still good experience!",

When it comes to Cheesesteaks in AZ, I personally don't think it gets any better than Forefathers.   On your first visit you might feel like their prices are a little on the high side but my guess is that by the next time you go you won't even be looking at the right side of the menu, you'll just be ordering.  I've tried the chicken as well and it's okay but the regular cheesesteak is where its at. Make sure you get fries too because they are equally amazing. I would totally recommend this place to anyone in the area.",

A regular cheesesteak is $10 while the large is $13. They are skinny and there is maybe a 2-3\" difference between the sizes. Fries alone are $3.50 and they are similar to the size of In-N-Out fries. The fries are great. I ordered my food as take-out. The \"low carb style\" is small in portion, which is probably the same portion to the sandwich. But, I would expect there to be more of the cabbage and some more meat since there is no bread. I ordered my sauces on the side, but they were not put in the bag. And if the sauces were in the refrigerator available for me to pick up it would have been nice for the employee to tell me that. So, I came home with no sauce so my sandwich tasted plain.",

While Forefathers' is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pat's, Geno's or Jim's a run for their money. And you don't have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce.  The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldn't need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try.",

Prices are kind of up there for fast-food sandwiches, but you get what you pay for. It's quality all the way. We usually get the large chicken cheesestake wit onions and whiz, and it's so big, we split it. Yum. Fries are awesome too!   Only complaint: closes at 8 p.m. Mon-Sat, and at 5 p.m. on Sun. Often on Sat's we're not thinking of dinner until 8-ish, and 5p.m. is kinda soon for Sun. Reminds me of Costco hours. Can't blame 'em, as they are probably family-owned.. but please think about staying open until 8:30 or 9 on Sat and maybe 6 on Sun. :)",

Grabbed sweet peppers and cherry peppers from the fridge 5. Combined everything together 6. Thought to myself, \"I am amazing.\"  All that for under $13.  Not bad!  The steak was juicy and tender, the veggies and cheese were of excellent quality, the pizza sauce took it up a notch, and the cheese whiz sealed the deal - like frosting on a cake!  I also really enjoy how they have the sweet peppers, cherry peppers, jalapenos, and fry sauce in little to-go containers.  When I'm not in a steaky mood, I opt for the chicken + mozzarella + buffalo sauce, can I get a \"hell yessss\"?  Bottom line: come out here and make the founding fathers proud that our country can celebrate unapologetic gluttony/awesomeness.",

I'll be honest, I've never had a \"cheesesteak\" before, so my review is based off of Forefathers and not a comparison of a philly cheesesteak.  By the way, they don't claim to be a Philly Cheesesteak, just a Cheesesteak.  Maybe it doesn't matter.  Whatever.  The first time I had a regular size with Cheez Whiz, no peppers and onions.  In my experience you get big long strips of peppers and onions, so I passed.  I also heard a real cheesesteak has cheez whiz on it, not provolone, so I opted for the Cheez Whiz.  I also got an order of fries.  Let me say, you get a TON of fries and the regular size Cheesesteak is almost as big as a footlong.  This sandwich was YUMMY!!!  The fries were really good, and you have unlimited fry sauce.  I think the fry sauce was good, but a tad bit bland.  So i used ketchup as well.  My hubby got the regualar size Cheesesteak with provolone, peppers and mushrooms.  I saw that the peppers were small and diced up!  He love his meal.  The second time I got the regular sandwich, cheez whiz and peppers, he got the large sandwich with provolone, peppers and mushrooms.  We split and order of fries this time.  His sandwich was too big, and usually he can really pack food in, so this goes to show how big the sandwich is.  Again, we loved it!  ****Warning****** the food is a bit on the satly side, so order a large drink and bring some Diurex with  you!  Your calves will look like tree trunks if you don't!  We will eat here again for sure.  I wish they were open a bit later though, they close at 8pm.  :-(",

While great tasting, can't imagine eating this all the time and staying slim. Will be back when craving something hearty and hefty.",

But your still thirsty!!!! No? Just me? Ugh, I digress!.. While I was here It got pretty busy and loud, which I didn't mind at all. I like the atmosphere and really liked the cheesesteaks. It was pretty huge, and the fries with cheese sauce were really good! I would come back here, but maybe not right before a night out, I'm pretty sure with all the water I drank I looked about 6 months prego!! :)",

For a good deal of the time I was in the food business, and I have made my share of cheesesteaks. I try not to gush in my reviews nor do I criticize if I can help it (having been on the other side, I know how it hurts). But after eating at Forefathers for the first time, I can tell you this: You can get on a plane and fly to Philly for a great cheesesteak, and I have been to all the places there, but you can get one just as good right here. They do everything right- the set-up, the bread, grill technique, the meat, all perfect, as are all the extras- fried onions, mushrooms, green peppers, and your choice of cheese. I recommend provolone, but you have to try \"Whiz\" at least once. When I saw the price (about $8) for a small sandwich, I thought it was a bit high- until I saw it. They really overstuff a 7\" roll. I haven't had a large sandwich yet (app. $11) but I plan to rectify that as soon as possible!",

I Googled Philly Cheesesteaks in Arizona and Forefathers came up, even better it was less than 5 minutes from our house. I saw they closed at 8 and it was already 7:30, we grabbed the keys and off we went. When we got there a table of 12 was finishing up as well as another of 2, 3 people came in behind us so we did not feel too bad being late comers. We were pleasantly welcomed by the staff and ordered our food. A few more patrons would trickle in both to dine and get take out. My husband and I both agreed our sandwiches were delicious. He got the original with cheez-wiz and peppers and I had the cheesesteak with onion and american. I thought it was nice that they came out in the dining room to ask how it was, a few people even came in at 8:02 and they we more than happy to serve them unlike other places that will turn you away 5-10 before closing. We will defitnitley be back, I am anxious to try the pizza steak on my next go around. Glad to have found you!",

There is nothing I like better in the food service industry than a business run by local owners who are on-site and often do the cooking and care about customer service.  Their sub rolls are baked locally and the meat is flown in from Philidelphia.  For those of you non-beef eaters, they serve a chicken filled sub.  Prices range from $6.59 (including tax) for a regular sized sub to $10.89 (including tax) for the large with fries and a large soda.  I'm told a real Philly cheese steak is made with Cheese-Wiz (when I think Cheese Wiz, I think an aersol can, but this Wiz is different).  I prefer provolone cheese versus Cheese Wiz (the Wiz is a little too sweet for me). But, as the company tee shirts proclaim, \"there's nothing like a good wiz\".",

The BBQ Chicken Cheesesteak is a beastly concoction.  You get fresh bread slathered with wiz, loaded with barbecued chicken, and then topped with coleslaw.  Of course I added bacon too.  When we got our food I kind of stared at it for a while.  I wasn't sure what to do with it.  How was I supposed to pick it up?  That would just be lame.  Ready with an arsenal of wet naps in my purse, I dug in to the most precarious food eating situation I have ever found myself in.  The first bite left me drooling wiz.  The second bite had coleslaw covering my hands.  The third bite had chicken falling out.  You get the idea?  It was messy and it was wrong.  It was so wrong it was right.  I really dug this weird combination.  The bacon just really pushed the sandwich from great to stellar.  I have to mention that their barbecue sauce is really good!  It's barely sweet, really smokey, and it packs a lot of flavor.  The bottom line is that I really liked this place.  I would like to go back and just try a regular cheesesteak with some fries.  Why fries too?  Because they have FRY SAUCE!  Woot!",

Order a regular cheesesteak, cheese fries, soda for both of us.  The steak was tasted like minute steak, the cheese I could not taste.  The FF were covered with too much cheese.  And did I say it was too loud to even hold a conversation unless you wanted to talk louder than the guy yapping a foot away from you.  So after watching here is what I recommend if you do go.  Get the cheez whiz on your steak and do not get cheese on the FF.  But if you want a really good cheesesteak go to Philly's Famous in Chandler.  Oh yea just because you call it Gourmet, does not make it gourmet. Gourmet  describes a class of restaurant, cuisine, meal or ingredient of high quality, of special presentation, or high sophistication.  None of that is happening here.",

    "text": "ALMOST desperately searching for an awesome cheese steak sandwich. You know how it is when you know exactly what you want and then the craving sets in.  Well anyway so I checked out the Yelps. Good reviews, it's close to where I am, and it sounds like they had what I was lookin' for.  So in I go on a Wednesday night, just about 7:30. And I gotta say I hate being the guy that comes in just before closing! But anyway, It's a regular sandwich place so it could be quick. I get right up to the counter, can't decide if I want the \"original\" (whit onions & wiz) or the \"cheesesteak\". I also hate deciding so I got both! A good way to shop the wares.  The guy behind the counter was friendly, offered me a meal deal so I got that too.  As I sat and watched while my sandwiches were being done, I could see the staff interacting with patrons. I liked most of it. However I did see something I didn't like. Another guests order came up and the caller calls out the number. If I hadn't seen his lips move I would have thought he didn't say a word. The anxiously awaiting patron that wasn't paying attention had no idea his families food was up. So there it sat. A few minutes go by and the shy little caller tries again, this time with a head nod. Still no luck, I almost wanted to go get the food and serve it myself. Mind you it was almost closing and they weren't real busy. Finally on the third try, as the patron was getting nervous, the message was received. Which was good 'cause my sandwiches were now coming up and I wasn't waiting for this whole event to start over. I met him at the counter as he set the food on the tray and away I went.  As I dug into my meal, I was very pleased to find that it was just what I had been looking for. Now I don't claim that it's as good as in Philly cause I never been there. But I do know good grub when it's in front of me. I polished off both of the regular sandwiches and the fries. Yea I was stuffed, but I felt like I was satisfied, and that my friend is why I go out anyway.  I'll go back, and I'll take friends with me.  Bottom line, this place was just one shy guy away from five stars.",

It has become one of my all-time favorite places to eat now. I am usually a little bit on the frugal side but with this place I do make an exception. It cost me right around $10.00 for a lunch but I have to admit it will make you want to go back everyday. I usually get the pizza cheese steak with grilled onions and peperoni. and a side of frys.... and the awesome dipping sauce. Great dinning experience for sure. If you are looking for a great meal and friendly atmosphere this is the place for you. TRY IT!!",

I made the mistake of ordering a large and could not finish the entire sandwich, but it was so good I almost made it through.  I don't know what other yelpers are talking about using pre-cooked meat.  They were grilling up fresh Porterhouse steaks while I watched.  Fry sauce is great. The food was great and the atmosphere was great.  The place was clean, including the bathrooms.  I will be back for more as soon as I recover from this food coma...",

I put some sweet peppers on it and sometimes sprinkle some malt vinegar over it. Th fries are yummy with the fry sauce. I like their iced tea and I like that they make a chilled espresso drink that you can pour yourself for the same price as a soda. The employees are really friendly, they say hi the minute you walk in, converse with you, and even offer advice. The guy behind the counter gave me and my kids free cookies, which were awesome by the way! This place seems pretty True to Pat's Steaks in Philadelphia with the chopped meat and cheese whiz, I am guessing it would taste similar.",

As i walked in i was greeted by the friendly staff.  At the counter, I reviewed the giant menu posted on the wall.  Being that this wasn't my first time there, it didn't take long to decide on the regular Philly with Cheese Whiz, which is essentially nacho cheese.  I chose grilled onions as my topping along with fries and a drink.  The total came to about $12, a little much, but really only a few more dollars than what you would pay for a combo meal at any fast food joint.  Everything was grilled and prepared fresh to order right in front of me, and the wait was under 5 minutes.   There was decent amount of seating inside and out.  I went outside because the weather was nice.  My first bite was like a meatastic heaven as molten cheese, onions, and shredded steak made my filling Philly dream.  With every bite I could feel my arteries filling with the golden goodness.  The fries provided the perfect balance of crisp outside and soft warm inside.   Overall my experience was satisfactory I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys tasty meats and gooey cheese.",

The cheesesteaks are AMAZING; the fresh meat sliced and cooked to perfection and just oozing with cheese or cheese wiz. As for the sides,  I am partial to the sweet potato fries with their homemade (complimentary) honey mustard sauce, and the hubby enjoys their regular fries with the homemade fry sauce. Although, the fries are not the reason you go to this place.  Great service and fabulous food. Somewhat of an obscure location, so I certainly hope that business is steady enough to keep the place around for the long haul. It was so good that we went here twice in the week that we first tried it.  Yummy!",

I went there yesterday and was greeted at the register by the owner who chatted me up for a few minutes and suggested fry dipping combos for me to try, I can't say enough about the staff, great people.    Yesterday I had the original and a side of sweet potato fries. The original is a 9 inch (I think) roll with sliced rib-eye, grilled onions, and cheese whiz... holy cow, it was delicious. The meat was tender, not stringy or chewy and had enough flavor to make it through both the cheese and the onions, which were just wonderful icing on the cake. The roll was firm enough to hold up to all the juices, yet was soft and tasted very fresh. The sweet potato fries also blew me away, they were not overly fried by any means, just enough to be hot and steaming and were wonderfully sweet. The owner convinced me to take a side of honey mustard to dip them in, and it was a terrific choice. The dressing added a little sweetness, but the mustard added just enough tang to produce a delightful symphony between the two. Yum.    I strongly recommend Forefathers, I have been several times and it is so good each time. The decorations are interesting, the food is delicious and the staff is attentive and extremely friendly and helpful. Go. You'll thank me.",

Being Deaf, I am sometimes wary of ordering in loud places, and although Forefathers wasn't exceptionally loud, there was enough noise that I struggled with ordering and hearing. The guy taking my order was super nice and very understanding, he even wrote out what I ordered to make sure it was correct (HUGE BROWNIE POINTS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THERE... THAT GUY SHOULD GET A RAISE). My food only took about 5 minutes to get to me, and by the time I had filled my drink and gotten together napkins (which were REALLY, REALLY needed), it was ready.  I got the mini cheesesteak with provolone, onions, green peppers, and mushrooms, mini fries, a cookie, and a drink - all for $8.30. The roll was soft and delicious, and the meat & veggies were unbelievably flavorful. The cookie was just as amazing as the other reviews said it would be - gooey and chewy on the inside. The mini meal was the perfect size for lunch, and even then I couldn't finish all of the fries.  Be advised: you WILL need like 500 napkins, moist towelettes, and possibly a shower after eating their cheesesteaks: SUPER messy, but SO worth it. I recommend this place without hesitation for their excellent customer service, clean restaurant, freakin delicious food, and awesome set up.",

This small restaurant in a Tempe strip mall has earned a special place in my heart.  No, not just because of the artery-strengthening cheese.  It is home to the best cheesesteak I have experienced since moving to AZ.  While the menu offers a variety of choices other than cheesesteak sandwiches (chicken and even *gasp!* salads), I stick with what I know and love:  Regular with Cheez Wiz ($7.35) - bring your appetite, because this sandwich is big!  A generous portion of thinly sliced meat and that oh so important Cheez Wiz is nestled within a soft bun.  It is gooey, drippy and messy.  Perfect.  If Wiz is not for you, it is also offered with white American cheese, Provolone or Mozzarella.  While I prefer mine with just the basic meat and cheese, you healthy types can also get any combination of 'OMG' - onions, mushrooms and green peppers.  Fries are a very nice compliment to the sandwich.  Let's be honest here, fries are a very nice compliment to nearly anything.  Forefathers' fries ($2.55) are hot, salty and crisp.  If you haven't gotten your fill of Wiz on your sandwich, you can turn those fries into Cheese Fries ($2.95).  Either way, be sure to grab a container of 'fry sauce' (I am guessing this is some blend of ketchup and mayo).  One taste and you will want to put this on everything.    Lucky for me and my cholesterol level, this gem is nowhere near where I live.",

The first time I came here, I got the cheese steak with provolone, which was a mistake!  You have to get it with the cheese whiz or else you're not getting the full flavor and it's honestly really good.  The fries are fresh and crispy, made when you order them!  The fry sauce is actually very good, and I'm not a fry sauce person.  Lastly, you NEED to try the cookie.  OMG - it's is delicious, soft and fresh.  It's worth every penny.  Come and try this place out!  It's great for lunch, they are quick with their orders!",

Oh and if you're a cookie lover make sure to grab your favorite one before you leave for dessert.   The prices aren't to high I'd say about average for the amount of food you get. The wait especially during the lunch and dinner hour is a little long but definitely worth it. For the amount of people that come here to eat during peak hours you'd think they'd had enough space to sit and enjoy your meal but that's not the case here. If you have time to wait for a seat then really it's no biggie but if it is call ahead to pick your food up and head out.   The employees are very friendly and considering how crazy busy this place gets its pretty clean.  Overall, definitely a must try",

The ambiance is cute and very patriotic...very welcoming.  The young, male dominated staff was also very nice and seemed happy to answer any questions.    The restaurant was clean as were the restrooms and everything was well stocked.  They have a nice outdoor patio area where you can eat as well and they provide a red condiment cart for things you may need if eating outdoors...very nice touch!   My husband and I are BIG eaters, no doubt about it, and we were shocked at the huge portions and even more shocked that neither one of us could finish our food. That is a RARITY!   We each order a large cheesesteak combo and our total came to $35.98 with two soft drinks included.  Check out the photos for more detail about the food.    Forefathers is an absolute GEM.  We aim to come back every time we visit the Tempe area. If you are lucky enough to LIVE here, check them out of you like cheesesteak sandwiches.  You will NOT be disappointed!",

Good people and food ordering/delivery flow. All hard surfaces inside so when it's crowded can get a bit loud, not too bad. Menu boards are easy to read, pretty simple offerings and pricing. I rate atmosphere 7 out of 10.  Service: very basic, wasn't \"friendly\" on this trip, but did the job. You order at the counter, couple guys looking at you, helpful but that's about it. Not bad. Food comes up pretty quickly, that was cool. And it's definitely made fresh as it's steaming. I rate service a 6 out of 10.  Food: the cheesesteaks are really good and portion size is excellent. I ordered the large with fries and was stuffed. The quality was very good, plenty of Wiz, which I love and has been an issue at other steak places who skimp on the Wiz, not here. I've eaten steaks in Philly at many of the big names including Jim's, Steve's Prince of Steaks, Dalessandros, Pats, Genos, Tony Luke's and I'd say Forefathers steaks are very good for Arizona steaks and better than some in Philly. Stream of consciousness about to follow, bear with me,...I'd like to find, review and compare a bunch of steak places in my area like I did with Thai food restaurants. Hmmmm, ya, that's next!! I digress, back to the food at Forefathers. All is served hot and fresh. Fries were hot and crunchy and delicious. It's very cool that at the end of the counter they have a small glass door refrigerator filled with peppers and their special fries sauce, all were excellent. They also offer pumps of flavored hot sauces, a very nice touch. The bread was soft and perfectly steamed, the correct amount of onions and mushrooms topping the moist, hot, tasty steak. It's clear Forefathers focuses on the food as the main event, this is not a bad thing. I rate the food 9 out of 10.  I was torn a bit on this review between a 3.5 and 4 star rating. Service with a smile would have easily pushed it to 4 stars. Maybe it was an off day. Maybe it was subconsciously me because I got a speeding ticket in a construction zone on the way here, DOH!!! Help a brother out, mark those cops on Waze people!! Anyway, I'm giving Forefathers the benefit of the doubt and rounding up to four stars. Would I return to Forefathers? And, would I recommended Forefathers to others? -- YES, absolutely! --  If you're anywhere near the area and want a high-quality, delicious, hot, large, \"real\" cheesesteak, stop in! I don't believe you'll be disappointed!",

It's like plain bread that has been sitting there all day. When other sandwich shops are warming their bread or giving you softer bread, this one just fails in comparison. The meat was good but it tasted like any steak sandwich because the cheese is where the flavor comes from. The prices are pretty high too, two of us had regular sandwiches and fries and the bill was $29. Overall it was ok.",

It's been busy since we got here which was a good sign. Bathrooms very clean also fyi. Ordered a large philly sweet peppers, cheese wiz and fries and drink, $17. Damn. Hmm just saying. Meat is soft, could have a little more flavor but hey their recipe. Cheese wiz nice and cheesy and salty. Grilled onions and peppers of course were good.  Overall all was good until my wife pulls out some hair from her sandwich  part way through. Debated whether to say something now or on our way out as to not make a scene nor to try and get free food which we don't want. Braved the rest of our sandwiches cautiously and yes they were fine, but sorry hair in the food kinda gave her a bad experience. Have no problem coming back and trying g a chicken philly next time. But folks need to watch the hair, hair nets or get some bald cooks.",

Cheese was abdundant enough but if you really dont give a F about your diet, get the extra cheese and live a little. Oh and the fry sauce!

I got the steak with provolone cheese and added grilled onions and mushrooms with some cherry peppers and jalapenos. One of the best things about this place are there side sauces. Their fry sauce is really good but my favorite was their cilantro ranch! I like how they have tons of cherry peppers and fry sauce next to the soda machine so you can grab your own peppers. I really enjoy the bread here too. Soft, yet it holds up to all of the cheesesteak toppings. Fries are delicious and really crispy. This place is a little on the pricey side (roughly 14 bucks for cheesesteak, fry, and a drink) but I think that the quality of the ingredients is worth the price.",

So much so that you had to either order your food to go or wait until you noticed someone getting up to sit down. The size of the regular subs scared me a bit. They were huge, but I noticed that's what a lot of people had on their plates. I chose the mini/lunch portion. I got my cheesesteak sub with Provolone Cheese, grilled onion, mushrooms and sweet peppers. I also chose regular fried or sweet potato fries.   Immediately upon first bite I knew I made the wrong decision with getting the mini sub. It was absolutely divine. I'm not afraid to say this was the best cheesesteak sub I've had in Arizona. It damn sure taste like those cheesesteak subs back East. Hand down!",

My brother-in-law took us here and I ordered the original with provolone (sorry, I don't like cheese whiz), mushrooms and bell peppers. Simply put, this is the best cheesesteak I've had. The French fries are good too, although I prefer ketchup to their fry sauce.

I love that their meat are sliced very thinly and not full of rind and fat. This is a big deal for someone like me who is very picky with my meat quality. Their sandwich is not overly salty and greasy (we have provolone cheese). Best of all, you get free grilled onions, green peppers and mushrooms!   Their french fries are so good, I think they are battered. They also offer sweet potato fries but we didn't order that. Maybe next time.   Will definitely return. In fact, I can't wait to go back! I'm already craving for their cheesesteak right now....",

I've had every cheesesteak location in Washington state, and up and down the east coast (I travel for work). Upon hitting this location today (appropriately named, paying homage to the philly originals) this place not only pays homage in name, but in style, quality, and taste. EVERY single base is covered. From the type of bread, the way it's done. It was absolutely mouth watering and the closest I have tasted to the originals. I found it pleasant that they offered hearty salads and sandwiches and tomato bisque soup for those cold days. But what do you REALLY come here for? That's right, the cheesesteaks.  My only quip, is bring in tastykakes for the dessert and you've got philly covered.",

They also offer chicken, not just steak as well as salads. They always ask if peppers, onions, and mushrooms are okay, and you can decline some or all of them. A little pricey for a sandwich if you want a combo. About $12-13 if you get the regular size with fries and a drink. They do offer \"free\" drinks with purchase of fries but I think the best way to go is to get the mini combo if you want more than just a sandwich. Still one of my go to places. Will be back and highly recommend. Also they offer outdoor seating :)",

I got the jalapeno cilantro ranch and the cheese whiz on the side.  I liked the cheese whiz better than the ranch.  I also asked for extra extra mushroom but only seemed to get a few mushrooms :(. That's the only item I wanted with my Philly besides cheese.   We didn't get any sides except water. The prices are higher than our normal Philly spot and not much different,  but still pretty tasty.   For that price I expected more especially with the innards O.D. the sandwich.

I ordered a regular grilled steak with grilled onions, green peppers, provolone and cheez whiz, plus cheese fries.  The cheesesteak is phenomenal, like best I've had outside of Philadelphia good. For me the regular seems like more than enough, but I could definitely see why someone would want a larger size. The fries are very salty, I wish they didn't have so much salt because they'd be really good beyond that.  The restaurant is very clean with plenty of seating, both indoor and outdoor. Overall I will definitely be returning to Forefathers.",

Luckily for us we discovered Forefathers and I have to say hands down it was the best cheesesteak we've had.  The guys were awesome and the menu was so simple and straightforward.  And can I just say that the fry sauce is AMAZING!! Make sure to put that on your cheesesteak.  The only thing missing was onion rings. :(  I love onion rings with my cheesesteak and wished they had some. I would definitely recommend this place and it's now our new favorite cheesesteak shop!!",

The owners were in there every day as nice as they could be and everyone that worked there was happy and helpful and pleasant. My sandwich order is a unique one and not only did the staff prepare my food with gusto, the owner even joked that he was going to list my sandwich on the menu as the 'Kelly special.'   I moved away from Phoenix 5 years ago and think of Forefathers often. This week I am in town visiting so of course I had to stop by for a sandwich. I placed my order and was told they didn't have tomatoes anymore. Ok. Then I was told they didn't have lettuce, 'we just have lettuce for salad.' Oh, so you do have lettuce. 'Yes, but it's in that bucket over there.' Ok cool, sounds good, you can use that. A girl behind the grill then said, 'no we can't put lettuce on your sandwich.' I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. I just stood there, speechless. Again, keep in mind, I have ordered at least 100 of these sandwiches in my lifetime from this exact location. Another employee said 'it's a spring mix so it won't really work...' I said perfect, that's exactly what I want, thanks! Luckily the sandwich was delicious = 4 stars, but the service? A zero.",

You really can custom order your sandwich, and with so many options you're bound to come back to try them all.   The prices are so reasonable, whether you're ordering just a sandwich or a lunch meal.   All of the staff were pretty friendly, the restaurant was well kept and clean, plus it's in a convenient location. Although it's in an odd area of the shopping center, it's worth the drive!  I would recommend coming here for lunch or for a snack, everything was great that we tried plus it's close to shopping and things to do.",

We got a free drink with our order since we got a sandwich and side. He got his with mushrooms and provolone, I got the works. Mushrooms, onions and jalapenos with wiz cheese, please. Also got the fry sauce on the side which are located to the side of the counter by the sodas. We did not wait long before our order was up and we were able to grab a table inside.   It was love at first bite. Lol! My sandwich was a good size, sorry I forgot to take a pic. It was so big I could not finish it and actually should've gotten a mini one. The fries were cooked to perfection, crispy just the way I like it. And the fry sauce....no wonder why they have it stocked in to-go containers. It was all so good!

Really the employees are very friendly,  but they seam unaware of the pour quality of the food they are serving at relatively high prices.

I think the floors are the type that never look very clean, so they need constant attention.  The vent in the bathroom is a tell tale sign of overall lack of attention to cleaning details not to mention the drink station. Being from Philadelphia does make me critical of the steak, but most of my review is not steak related.  I give the steak 3 stars; the roll being the closest I have found in the valley to right, but the meat... for get about it.",

Now, don't get me wrong, these cheesesteaks are better than those you'll get at a mall food court, but like those in south Philly, they are not.  The last time I was here I was really thinking I'd have a delicious sandwich, and it was ok, but really had no flavor.  I always get mine with everything minus green peppers, and provolone for the cheese.  The meat was tender, bread soft, but the sandwich had absolutely no flavor.  None.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I think I've satisfied my cravings for Forefathers and will wait til my next trip to Philly to have another cheesesteak.    OH!  And I can't believe I almost forgot this, but I always get a kick out of the fact that this place is always full of dudes.  Always.  Single ladies, if you like a meat-eating man, get your carnivore on and go cruise this joint.  You will be WAY outnumbered.",

Most places are really terrible at making them.  Forefathers is different.  They used the right cut of steak, the required white american cheese, onions and peppers.  They even had pickled cherry peppers-this was a strong indicator to me that they were going to be genuine! To top it all off, they had Fry sauce with their delicious and crispy french fries! Fry sauce is uncommon in AZ, so this was a total win.  I will be back, often. Great work people of Forefathers!",

Grilled fresh mushrooms with the right amount of grilled onions and Wiz. No one ingredient overpowered the others. Man it was hot and juicy, just awesome.

Hands down, the best Cheesesteak I have ever had (having never been to Philly) and will continue to have.   The roll is fresh with just the right balance needed on for the sandwich. The steak is cooked to perfection. The cheese is exactly what it needs. You can get it wit or wit'out (with onions or not) and have a large selection of cheeses including the original Cheez Wiz (my personal favorite). Their large is completely filling but only necessary if you are starving. Get a regular and combo it with the regular fries. Then you must try out the Utah-stolen \"fry sauce\" (a combination of Mayo and Ketchup that hits the spot with fries). Considering I am grew up in Utah, these guys are my new best friends.  NOTE: If you plan on become a regular like me, request the rewards card from them. I only recently became aware of this as they do not advertise it but make sure to pick one up. Get 100 points (spend $100) get a free cheesesteak.   Now please, stop reading and get a Cheesesteak.",

It's not overly oily or greasy, and really hits the spot when you're craving a cheesesteak.  Make sure you get some of their fry sauce, which is just a variation of thousand island dressing (but is so good).

Now, let's watch the cook take inferior meat that has already been chopped up and is waiting in bins and dump it onto the grill with the pre-cut and measured onions and peppers and voila your sandwich is ready in 2.5 minutes. I want my freakin steak to start red and get cooked on the grill you idiots.  Ok, now let's pay $8 for a tiny sandwich that uses SIRLOIN steak, not ribeye and be happy about life. Nah, let's just call this place what it is:  a ripoff, a place that uses cheap ingredients to make a profit on the poor customers of Phoenix, who don't ask questions and assume because they throw alot of cheap meat into the bun, it must be worth the price.      Some folks take cheesesteak seriously and no lazy establishment is getting my cash these days. There was nothing to these sandwiches. no flavor and using sirloin is basically the equivalent of buying a pack of Steak-umm's and making these yourself at home.

When I requested cheese fries (with melted mozzarella--something you can get in any pizza parlor in Philly) they were happy to make it for me (as pizza fries are on the menu) but it was battered fries with a SLICE of mozzarella melted on top. The cheese was lucky that it coated 10 fries. There are better places in Phoenix to get a passable cheesesteak (there is one place who's name I cannot recall, that actually flies in Amoroso rolls, tastykakes and Goldenburgs Peanut Chews--that sort of effort is to be commended.)

Oh sure, the roll isn't nearly as good as Delassandro's (my favorite in Philly') and it probably doesn't measure up to this year's winner (Johnny's Hots) in Philadelphia Magazine, but these people are doing a great job with what they have. They even offer one so large, I believe it comes with wheels, so you can drive it home.  Great taste and you can have Cheese Whiz on it to make it even more authentic. Plus look at ALL you will have saved in airfare!  If the rolls were better I would have opted for FIVE STARS, but these rolls will suffice to make it a terrific experience.",

    "text": "I usually make it a point to never order a cheese steak anywhere...except when I'm actually in Philadelphia. I mean, once you taste of the perfection that is a genuine steak sandwich (wit wiz) from Philly, you realize how far short everything else measures up. There's usually no point in bothering with any of the \"authentic\" \"original\" blah blah blah cheese steak travesties that are dished up anywhere west of the Appalachians. Seriously. Well, that was until today. I finally found a place that got it right. This is as close as it gets to the real thing (close, not exact). And how I was delighted to fill my belly with its meaty cheesy goodness! Mmm!  I ordered the Regular sized Philly Original (exactly like I order it back in Philly actually). It's got meat, grilled onions, and cheese wiz; that's it! That's all that's supposed to be on there as far as I'm concerned. It was all cooked to perfection too. The bun was almost perfect--something about the texture was slightly off from the real deal, but it was still the best you're gonna get around here. I ordered fries with my sandwich too. They tasted like they were double fried (and I mean that as a good thing) because they were extra crispy. Overall, I left full and satisfied. I'll be back. Bravo to Forefathers! Keep up the good work!",

    "text": "Napkins required! I dare you to eat a wonderfully gooey cheesesteak here without making a mess.   They do a great job on their food. The roll is springy and fresh. The steak has great flavor, texture, and a thickness. You have a lot of cheese options, but they have the classic cheese wiz. We're talking old school style cheese wiz. A real treat, but if you're a bit faint of heart on cheese wiz, their other options won't disappoint. Grilled onions are good and retain a nice texture. A HUGE plus in my book is being able to add regular ol' sauteed bell peppers, instead of the sweet pickeled ones (they have those too, I just can't get past the taste of them no matter where I am). For a little heat, you can add cherry peppers or jalapenos. I went for cherry peppers and it was awesome. The even better part that has to be mentioned is this is a cheesy cheesesteak. I like mine cheesy and without fail I have to order extra cheese, well until I came here. Their regular sandwhich, without extras, satisfies my cheesy needs and then some. Of course, should I ever want to experience cheese nirvana, they offer an option for extra cheese. One of these days, I'll order extra cheese, simply because I can, but right now the idea of extra cheese here is slightly intimidating in the best possible way.   Fries are fries, but their's are good. What makes them special is the dipping sauce they have. Reminds me of what mom called \"russian dressing\" and put on hamburgers when I was a kid. I still make it to this day.  I'm not going to ruin the recipe for them, but it's a mayo and tomato based sauce that you mustn't pass up. It's almost a mexi-ranch without the ranch flavor.   Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable enough to make solid recommendations, if you want to have a sandwhich that is far better than an average cheesesteak. Service is quick, but there was nobody ahead of me when I went. Prior trips have felt similarly fast though with consistently good quality service.   In a valley of mediocre cheesesteak shops, Forefathers is a cut above the rest.",

Forefathers quickly grabbed my attention.  Meat & Cheese yes! So there we go, I had the beef with cheese wiz, my BF had the chicken with marinara.  Both were loaded with meat/chicken, they were not stingy at all with the meat.  The lady at the counter was so friendly and helpful too.  I was able to get 2 cookies as a side, and OMG those cookies were the best! Make sure you try them, they are homemade, fat, and soft with chocolate chips. And normally I don't consider myself much of a french fries enthusiast, but they were so good I ended up eating half of my boyfriends order. I also loved the American theme, and felt like the place was a family business, I could be wrong but thats the vibe I got.  Overall, a very pleasant surprise.",

They use Kraft cheese whiz, which I could have bought at the grocery store. Meat didn't have much flavor. I felt like I got railed on the price, $30 for two sandwich combos, Cmon.

The fry sauce was undetectable on the sandwich but I didn't mind seeing as they have a fridge full of free fry sauce next to the drinks.

My husband and I tried this for the first time 2/18 and with him being a Philly native he is very picky of his steaks. But as soon as we walked through the door he looks at me and tells me \"smells like home\". RIGHT AWAY we order and our 2 Philly cheese steaks OMG style And couldn't wait for our anticipated meal to arrive. Once we passed the sauce station, which might I add is quite extensive and has a great array of flavors,(Jalapeno cilantro ranch,like yummm!) we took our seats. With in a minute we had our first bite of heaven. The bread was soft with just the right amount of toasted crunch. The PROVALONE cheese was glued to the sirloin steak and along with it came the the omg flavors! ABSOLUTELY A NIRVANA MOMENT!

I walked in just before lunch time, and didn't have to wait in line I ordered #2 the Philly steak, and provolone wit onions.  I know cheese wiz is the way to go for a traditional cheese steak, but I am not a fan of cheese wiz in general; I prefer a better quality cheese like provolone. I decided to get the large, and a combo with fries, and drink. I looked down at the counter ready to pay, and I saw a huge awesome cookie. The guy at the register claimed they were good so I had to try it out.  The total for this gourmet meal was $15...  I got the order in under one minute. I was pleasantly surprised, but at the same cautious because the food came out so fast it would suffer in quality.  Boy I was wrong! The Philly Steak was one of the best I have had if not the best. The fries were amazing!. Make sure you get the \"fry sauce.\"  I washed it down with a coke, and finished it off with the giant cookie. The cookie was amazing.  The only negative thing I could say about this review is the price, but you get what you pay for, and I went all out. Look to spend about $8-$12 which is standard for a Philly Steak around this area.",

Style (with onions, mushrooms, & green peppers) and the Chicken Cheesesteak with Provolone, OMG! Style. We agreed & got those along with a side of fries. Their combo includes a free drink when you order a sandwich & any side.  The food came out really quickly & after only a couple of bites, it didn't seem worth it. Our combos were $11.25 each after tax ... Way overpriced. I only tried a bite of the steak so not much to comment about that but the chicken was cut too large & had no flavor ... the OMG didn't do much for it either. They had \"fry sauce\" too was basically just mayo & ketchup - not very impressive.  So, in conclusion: Was it bad? No, it wasn't bad; we ate what we ordered. Was it good? No, it wasn't good either ... and it was definitely nothing special where we will we return.",

You will pay a gourmet price for a truly gourmet meal; this does not stop us. Though the menu is limited, they aspire to make what they offer amazing. The staff is very friendly and offer great advice if you're just not sure what to get. You cannot go wrong with a regular steak sandwich with provolone or mozzarella, an order of fries with a drink. If you're looking for a lighter side of things, the salads are equally as good. I recommend this place to everyone that finds themselves in the area. We will be back, many tines more.",

Keyword: maybe, as I never asked. Regardless, compared to the Philly cheesesteak sandwich in well... Philadelphia (I'm thinking of Geno's, Pat's, Luke's, etc) Forefathers makes the best I've had in Arizona. Keep up the great work!",

Overall it was good. *one shoulder shrug* I appreciate the fries staying crunchy long enough for me to get back to my desk and eat. I'm assuming the foil helps with that? Tea - meh. It said black tea but tastes like blueberry. Which was an okay taste, but not what I thought I was getting. 3 stars from me simply because I feel it's over priced. $13 for this meal......I'd be back if it was closer to $8.",

The staff is friendly (ironic that you can't call this authentic, getting one in Philly will be more abrupt) and fast.  The various pepper selections are nice, turns out jalapenos are a welcome addition to a cheese steak.  Overall though, I just have to come back to price.  A cheese steak with fries and a drink will set you back $14!  I can find solid lunch any time for less than $10.",

There were less than 20 people at any given time while I was there and the noise level was absolutely awful. I could barely hear the guy taking our order, and I have (what my husband refers to as) dog-like hearing.  (there is an outside seating area) The cheese steak subs are uber good!!! Get the Whiz on yours, because that makes it authentic AND it tastes better (we've now been two times and the hubs tried provolone this time and 'meh). We've tried both the steak and cheese options, both are terrific. Their fries are pretty good, too!",

One of the problems with most cheese steaks is the bread.  Forefathers has a really good bread that actually mimics the bread you get in Philly.  The fries are also some of the best I've had in AZ.  They are nice and crispy like they are double fried.  And the plus is they are quick.  Even when they are busy, you can still eat lunch and get back to work.",

I've tried about every variation of sandwich you can try there and it's always been consistently great.  The employees are super friendly.  The fry sauce is good if you like sweet sauces.  The fries are good, just a little salt and whatever sauce you like and they are crispy and break up the heaviness of the steak.  I kind of like the cheese fries, but they get soggy and cold fast, so go at them right away!  I always know I see a regular when they're at a table with their fry sauces and other toppings all lined up and ready to go before they've even gotten their food.  The look of anticipation on their faces is always obvious, no matter how hard they try to look cool.  If you're in the area and want to try something new, something you won't find anywhere else near there, try this place.  Sometimes it gets full, so grab a table as soon as you see one, or you may have to sit outside.  Start with a regular cheesesteak before going for broke with the large.  I've never been able to finish a large and I'm a big boy.  Tip: try the tomato bisque, it seems out of place in a cheesesteak joint, but it's amazing.",

    "text": "3.5 stars!  Came here on whim when this other cheesesteak spot we wanted to try out was closed for the day.  We had a long day of furniture shopping ahead of us and we needed to fill our tummies.  Enter Forefathers!  The establishment itself is very clean and modern.  The staff was patient while we studied the menu and they seemed like a happy bunch.  I had ordered a regular cheesesteak  provolone and some plain crispy fries .  I almost regret not getting it with Cheez Whiz and OMG style but I figured I didn't need all that cheese filling me up and onions and peppers just didn't draw me in.  I did end up having to dump some fry sauce into my cheesesteak after the provolone got cold and it became a bit dry to eat.  I think this sandwich had great flavor and it's pretty hefty and filling.  The price is a bit steep but you do get a lot of meat [although not fresh].  It's a solid and decent cheesesteak.",

I was getting ready to complain until I saw the menu. It was much simpler and less confusing. All you need is to pick is the size of the bread, steaks or chicken, types of cheese you like and all 4 ingredients. Simple! I like!   While I was waiting for my sandwich to go, I peeked around the restaurant. It is small but well organized. Staffs are young but friendly and polite. They have a small refrigerator to keep hot peppers fresh and organized (and clean). I was very impressed. Their ice tea is delicious. They have few tables in the outdoor area if you want to enjoy the beautiful weather of Arizona.  When I got home, I couldn't wait to eat the sandwich. I have to admit that it was very messy and end up eating it folks and knives Lol... it was juicy, meaty and delicious. Neither one of us could finish ours because the meat portion was generous. Their sweet potato fries are definitely sweet and delicious. We couldn't finish all of it and save it in the refrigerator for tomorrow.   Next time when I am in the general area again, I will stop by here for sure.",

Turns out the Cheese Whiz used on cheese steaks isn't the same kind college students stack with Ritz crackers to give themselves early heart attacks.   I had the #1 (Steak and Cheese Whiz) and it was delicious. I got fries and a drink as well and my total came out to ~$10. The portions are quite large and they give you a hefty serving of meat in the sandwich.   Be careful when eating because these sandwiches are literally dripping with cheese. The bun was great and somehow didn't get soggy.   I've been to a few places serving cheese steaks in the valley and this is the best, added bonus is you can be in and out of here in five minutes.",

However, I always have higher hopes for this place, especially with the words \"gourmet cheesesteaks\" in their name.  Alas, I'm always somewhat disappointed.  While the food is always edible, it just never seems to live up to their name, or these other high star reviews.  The bread is always a bit soggy so there's that.  I'm also apparently an odd bird, as I enjoy lettuce and tomato on my cheesesteaks.  Lettuce nearly non-existent and tomatoes are sparse, but to be fair, this is typical of any cheesesteak joint when I order those toppings.  A better cheesesteak, IMO, is Corleone's at 16th St / Camelback (not sure if they have other locations), but I no longer live in that area.  So, to conclude, Forefathers is just OK, nothing special, but could possibly satisfy your cheesesteak craving, depending on how particular you are.  If you enjoy sloppy, messy, wet cheesesteaks (and I know some people do!) then this is your place.",

Also I've never been disappointed in the service or the quality of the food. Yes at times you'll be dealing with a line but its not as bad only 5-10minute at max. Definitely a very friendly establishment.   I've try all the other sandwiches but I still think the original is the best. The meat was always cook just right, still tender and was never dry. Having good bread is also another key to a good cheesesteak sandwich and it wasn't disappointing at all. Pair it up with a side of sweet potato fries and your good to go! This place won't disappoint you! When I make my way back to Az for whatever reasons that is. This is definitely one of the places on my list that I'll be making a stop at.",

    "text": "The Cheesesteak Saga continues...  I had given up on Forefathers after a visit about a year ago resulted in a greasy steak with sparse, over flavored meat. But a recent return trip was better and showed why so many like the place.  A decent steak. I like the cheese options, as only tourists go for wiz. Provolone is the tip.   Meat was overall pretty good quality, though like many local sandwich places, there's not enough of it. They still over season. Good steak doesn't need to hide behind black pepper.  Serving peppers on the side is a nice touch. Found the fries, both traditional and sweet potato, to be good. Nothing remarkable.  Place is a little pricey compared to some competitors, but in all, a pretty good option for a displaced cheesesteak lover.",

    "text": "If you love a REAL Philly style Cheese steak then this IS THE PLACE! It's a local family owned spot on Priest near Warner. I HAVE to eat here anytime I am in the general area and I always get enough to take home. The cheese steaks reheat very well the next day.   If you are a vegetarian you can eat here too.. My daughter loves their grilled cheese, tomato bisque and veggie hoagie (mushrooms, onions, peppers, cheese on a nice fresh roll).  The salads are great and so are the regular and sweet potato fries. You have to try the fry sauce too and they even offer banana, sweet, and hot peepers on the side- FREE!   Last but not least the owner bakes the BEST chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted. I get 2 every time... They are chewy and pretty large for under $1.   Bottom line.... Go here, support a local family owned business and taste the greatest cheese steak in the Valley",

The first time you go, you just have to order the Original. I suggest adding mushrooms and peppers, too.  The atmosphere is fun and inviting. You can tell all the people working there are enjoying themselves and everything is extremely clean! So great to see a place proudly displaying their love for our country, too. Check it out!",

Phenomenal cheesesteak with cheese wiz is the way too go. Though all of the different ways are phenomenal! The sweet potato fries are great. And the fry sauce (I always did this after a friend of mine moved from Utah why we were kids). I find excuses to drive to Tempe just to get a cheesesteak. Must go!! Love this place",

    "text": "Forefathers always seems to be one of those places that I forget about until someone else suggests it.  Of course, when they do suggest it, I feel like smacking myself in the forehead . . . \"Forefathers!  Of course!  Why didn't I think of that!\"  I'm hoping that the more I go, the more Forefathers will stay top of mind and I will remember them when we're looking for a quick, yummy meal.  I have been a few times now and have to say the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is one of my favorite sandwiches! The bread is soft, the chicken is huge chunks of breast meat, the blue cheese and celery add the creamy and the crunch.  I usually stick to the smaller \"regular\" sandwich, and avoid the large size.  I can't bring myself to try anything else, even though I'm sure it would be delicious.  Good sweet potato fries and regular fries, too. Fry sauce and peppers (sweet, hot, and banana) available in single serving containers in a mini fridge by the drink fountain. Good iced tea, too! I like my tea unsweetened, but this one has a perfect hint of sweet.  The last time I was there I really wanted to try the tomato basil soup and a grilled cheese, but the buffalo chicken philly was calling to me!  The staff is friendly and always ready with a smile.  The place is clean and appears well-maintained.  I hear this place gets busy during the weekday lunch with all the Intel peeps coming over.  I have only been in the evenings and it's pretty quiet.  I am glad they are so busy at lunch; I wouldn't want them shutting down on me like so many other establishments have recently.  One of these days, I'll have to try something other than the Buffalo Chicken Philly . . . we'll see.  Why mess with perfection?",

    "text": "One of my favorite Tempe spots, Forefathers really instilled in me a love for the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. When visiting, I always order the 2nd cheesesteak option with white American cheese, and either a side of french fries or their equally excellent sweet potato fries. For those wanting to manage their portions, their sandwiches also come in smaller sizes. After placing your order, be sure to go to the small refrigerator across from the soda machine and get a side of their sweet peppers to accompany your sandwich. This place has great food, and along with it a comfortable, casual dining environment. It also has friendly ownership and staff. It's been a while since I lived in Phoenix, but whenever I return and come to Forefathers, there are people working here who remember me and welcome me back. If you check out Forefathers, I am sure you'll want to come back again.",

    "text": "My husband is a huge fan of cheesesteaks and I never really have been.  After eating at this place, I can finally understand why he loves cheesesteaks so much.    We came here after reading the reviews on Yelp, of course.  It's a small place with sufficient seating (outdoor seating also).  Very clean inside.  The employees are friendly and do not rush you with your order.  After eating at a different cheesesteak place, I had become weary of ordering whiz on my sandwich.  My husband bit the bullet and decided to try it, however, and after taking a bite of his, I wish I had did the same!  Their whiz is not that crap you find in a jar on the shelf in Walmart.  It has flavor and it compliments their cheesesteaks amazingly!  I had my cheesesteak with mozzarella or provolone (whichever is on the menu.. it's been a couple months since trying this place and I'm just now finding time to write up the review).  The cheesesteak is delicious by itself, but I definitely would have liked the whiz better.  These sandwiches are HUGE.  Glad I ordered the smaller one, because there's no way I could have eaten all of mine by myself.  Considering the cost, the portions are great!  Their fries were awesome, as well.  Next time, we'll try the sweet potato variety.  Never been a huge fan of them, because nobody can seem to make them taste good, but this place won't let me down, I'm sure! :)  If you like cookies -- grab a cookie from there!  They seem to be fresh baked and made in-house.  I could be wrong about that, but either way they are damn good!  Will be going back when we wander out that way again.  Will definitely be a staple destination spot anytime we find ourselves needing to go to IKEA, since it's nearby. :)",

All of us agree that Forefathers has the best cheesesteaks that any of us have had in Arizona-- they definitely rival the famous Pat's and Geno's cheesesteaks. The bread is fresh baked daily, the meat is great quality, and the portions are generous. Ask for their fry sauce on your sandwich (they'll put it on for you at no extra charge), and get a side of sweet potato fries to dip into the fry sauce, too. Mmm, food heaven!",

The bread was fresh and a great texture, the beef was cooked right with no \"mystery meat\" and the large size was certainly large. The cheese fries were fresh and cooked great as well. The only complaint I'd have wasn't the food, but the fact that even though it was an off time on a Saturday the dining room wasn't clean with trash on the floor and only a couple table tops not in need of wiping. But that has never stopped me from jamming my face with cheesy meaty goodness, so I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "If you were one of the many like me that used to make the pilgrimage to Bruchi's CheeseSteaks in Ahwatukee, you were probably also disappointed when you arrived that one day to find them out of business.  For years following their closure I sampled cheesesteaks here and there, but none of them even came close to the taste of what Bruchi's delivered.  Then a co-worker introduced me to Forefathers Gourmet Cheesesteaks & Fries in Tempe and I struck gold. These guys can really turn out a great sandwich.  My favorite is the #2 Cheesesteak (with grilled onions and white American cheese). The regular size is more than enough to satisfy most appetites, but if you are really hungry go for the large. The fresh baked Italian bread is great and they offer a variety of different flavor cheesesteaks to choose from.  If you do a combo meal with regular fries, be sure to get some \"fry sauce\" near the soda dispenser for something a little different.  I highly recommend this place to anyone out there who loves a good cheesesteak. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Being from just a little north of Philly, cheese steaks were a child hood staple.  I haven't any place any better than Forefathers for a good cheese steak (although I would be willing to try)  It's a quaint little place that doesn't go all out in decor, which is fine considering I'm used to some of the best cheesesteaks coming out of a cart.  They don't go all out in trying to impress you with the ambiance because they dump everything into what is most important, the food.  The sandwiches are incredible, and they offer a range of options and they are flat priced, $6.95 for a regular and $9.50 for a large.  The regular, with a side is a match for just about anyone.... want left overs or skipped a few days of eating then go for the large.  They offer salads and some other things, but I'm a meat and potato guy so I've never ventured passed the steaks and cheese fries.    All the subs are flavorly dressed just by themselves, but there are options for adding more, extra cheese, mushrooms, etc. (the add-on prices are very fair)  They brag that they aren't cheap on the meat and in their case, it is very True.  Plus the sandwiches are put together with perfect ratios so no one flavor is overwhelming another.  I also like that you can get sweet peppers, banana peppers, and other things like their \"fry sauce\" from a small fridge in the lobby... yeah, its open house, so no one looking down at you condescendingly when you grab a handful of pepper containers.  In the few times I've gone, I've learned my lesson, if you want to grab lunch during the work week, you've got to make it in by 1120am.... wait any longer and it gets packed quick.",
