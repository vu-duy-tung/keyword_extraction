When we were here in June she went twice in the same week and i have already there again since we moved here. She loves the the Burrito enchilada style with green sauce and rice and beans. I promise you when you get this food they put it in a container that keeps it hot for at least 3 hours...and i mean hot people. Now there are only about 5 items on the menu...and i will post those pics as well...and you will see that this Mexican food is expensive.  Despite all of that though there is always a crowd at this neighborhood spot...and you will see people from all walks of life there for lunch every single day. Now noticed i said lunch because they only stay open to about 4pm and then they are ghost folks...LOL. So i have to say if you want authentic Mexican food and don't mind going to the \"hood\" to get it...it will be the best 8 bucks you ever spent on Mexican food...at least that's what my wife thinks...LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!",

A lot of these things can be overlooked if the food was the bomb, but it wasn't anything special. Part of it has to do w/ the crappy and confusing menu, so I didn't get what I wanted.  The menu is confusing and the cashier didn't really explain things well either. My food took 30 minutes to get and that was after waiting in line for 10-15 minutes in their non-air-conditioned building. The food was good but average and quite a lot of excess tortilla compared to the amount of filling, and the sauce was quite salty. What was $11 here would be $8 everywhere else so I don't know how they get away with charging so much given their location and building.",

It took over and hour to get our food, i don't know what all the hype was about. I took my friend over to Litos on the west side the next week. Boy was he surprised when the staff was friendly, they had seating, and cold AC! It took less than 10 minutes place our order and have it out to our table hot and yummy! I think he won't be coming to ritos that often, Litos is his new spot lol! I for one won't be back to ritos, I think people need to see what REAL green chili taste like at Litos.

It must be good though because I've never seen this room empty.  People come and go the whole time you're waiting for your food.  They stand behind the security bar and you exchange payment/receipts through the space underneath.  Then you wait and get your food under the grate next to the \"order here\" window.  Why all the security?  I'm hoping never to really find out..  The food!  Although it's a bit nickel-and-dimey, ultimately it's decently priced.  It seems like they typed up a nicer looking menu recently too that helps immensely (before all I had was a picture of the lego board they had up).  Anyway, the food is pretty legit authentic Mexican dripping with verde sauce and covered with cheese.  If you're looking for Mexi-comfort, look no further!",

Today I had the red chili burrito enchilada style with a side of beans just like I used to have every payday when I worked at the local bank up the street. This burrito portion is huge and the red sauce was just a little over spicy like I remembered. I even had to wipe the sweat beads off my nose a few times.  So good, I'll say.  The menu is online, I called a head for pick up, I took cash, there is limited outdoor seating and parking might be an issue.",

But that isn't important, the food is what keeps drawing me back.  As other reviewers have mentioned, their tender, seasoned beef is top notch.  Both the red chili and green chili sauces are rich and tasty; I prefer the red but I still usually get the red sauce inside and the green sauce outside.  The beans - kind of half mashed - are nice seasoned as well and make an excellent side.",

It's damn the diet kind of food because this is one of life's great pleasures.  The most important thing about Rito's green chili burro is avoiding a blowout.  A blowout is defined as recklessly biting into the burro and putting too much pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  This creates a hole in the tortilla and the stew drips all over you.  Not only do you lose out on the greatness of the broth, but you have a mess on your hands.  Avoid a blowout at all costs.  The best method I have found is to massage the burro from the bottom up so as to get some of the liquid to the top of the tortilla.  Then when you start taking your first few bites, suck in when you bite.  This ensures you get plenty of liquid with each bite and you sufficiently reduce the pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  If the unfortunate occurs and you do experience a blowout, the best course of action is to remember the three second rule and quickly lick up all the broth on your hands, fingers, and table.  Sometimes it happens to the best of us so don't be too hard on yourself.",

I LOVE this place.  This is real Mexican food.  They serve salad with the Mexican food here in the bay.  If this place opened up on Geary in SF, there would be lines around the block!  Have a Red Chili and bean burrito enchilada style with a taco.  You will come back.",

It's just one of those places where you can just feel the \"Phoenician\" in. Personally, I love the tacos, but they only serve them on a few days. The green burritos enchilada style are also a favorite. The venue is cute and comfy, very minimal. It's also pretty hood, but unless you're from Ohio or something, it's not too sketchy. There are bright painted picnic tables outdoors. The crowd is diverse, from office workers, familys, youngsters ect. Everyone is there to just grab some yummy food and eat. I like the fact that it's in a neighborhood, it's a nice feel. It's very busy during lunch hours, so any time after 1:30 is perfect to drop by and grab a bite. :)",

    "text": "There's a place in Yuma, AZ called Chili Pepper which has some of the best Mexican fast food I've ever eaten. Once I moved to Phoenix, there has been a great citywide search by a group of us Yumans to find someone here that reminds us of Chili Pepper's marquee entree: The Bean, Rice & Cheese Burrito (not tm). Carolina's came close. Juan's fell decidedly short. A few other run down shacks that we've tried have always been inconsistant or disappointing...  One slow mid-morning at work we were trying to figure out a good fast place to get takeout and bring back to the office. Someone mentioned Ritos. Someone mentioned that they have the best bean and cheese burrito. My ears perked up. Upon arriving I noticed that they actually have a bean, rice and cheese burrito on the menu, something that most places have never heard of.  The burrito itself was HUGE. The salsa can be purchased in a large enough container that the whole burrito can be dipped in (don't laugh, this is an important aspect) and provides enough flavor and kick to compliment the beany goodness inside. After going there 3 times in one week, I am ready to declare this place even BETTER than my once perfect Chili Pepper.",

    "text": "I found Rito's by looking at their 4 1/2 star Yelp review.  I have to be honest, I didn't read the reviews; I just saw the overwhelming praise via the star rating and went just on that recommendation alone.  I am a HUGE fan of burritos - mostly from restaurants where I am the only non-hispanic in the place.  I have found a few places that never disappoint, but I am always in search of the Holy Grail of burritos, which I will probably spend the rest of my life gorging myself in vain - never satisfied that I have discovered the perfect burrito, like a confident New World explorer in search of the fountain of the youth - convinced that it is just around the river bend.  Anyhow, to the food......  My preference is carne asada burritos, which they do not carry.  No problem ---  I tried one of the beef green chili burritos.  Employees were super nice, price was reasonable, restaurant was clean, and  wait time was reasonable.  I figured out quickly that there was no interior seating, which was not an issue as I was focused on one thing - finding the best burrito I have ever tried.  It was not the best burrito I have ever had, and it was not the worst burrito by far.  I don't really consider it a burrito per se.  It was more like a light beef stew served in a folded tortilla - extremely watery, like soup.  Even as soup, it would have been a little bland.  To its credit, the beef was extremely tender.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much flavor there.  I took one bite into the end of the burrito, and based on the pressure caused by the watery contents, the entire bottom of the burrito ripped open and most the contents fell out.  I blame this not on my jaws of steel, but on the watery consistency of the filling and mostly on the relatively low quality tortilla.  Did that keep me from eating the whole thing and using the cap of my small salsa container as a spoon?  You already know that answer to that question.....  Then, I began to think that maybe their best meal isn't the burrito, but their good reviews are based on the variety of other options.  I didn't go back and read the reviews, so maybe that's the case.  Would I order another burrito from here?  No.  Would I order another item that might be more to my liking and, more importantly, explain why they got such great Yelp reviews?  Probably not.  Why?  I have about a thousand more burritos to try in my never-ending quest to discover the perfect burrito.  And when I do, I probably won't let anybody know so I can have all of them to myself.",

However, the food wasn't that great ($10 a piece isn't that cheap either).   One thing this place gets right is portions. They're huge.  But that's the only good I can say about this. The \"meat\" is mystery meat. I had no idea if it was chicken or beef or pork or veal or lamb or Buffalo or cat or dog or vulture. You get the point. It was cubes of mystery meat. The inside of the burrito tasted like old frozen Marie Callendar's chicken pot pie. All in all, I was going to walk away very full...until I found a long hair in food. It was long straight and swimming in my burrito. I was instantly disgusted and dumped it in the old tin trashcans, which symbolically were surrounded by flies.   I will not be back at Ritos. I'd rather go to Taco Bell honestly.",

About 3 months ago I ordered a bean and cheese burrito as I'm pouring the beans into my plate I grab some w my spoon and as I do so I see a nice big black hair so I call ritos speak to john he apologizes and offeres me a free meal next time so I let it go and went back about 4 days later (trying to decide if I wanted to go back) but I did this time I order a bean burrito enchilada style w red sauce I open it up cut it open and there goes a sticker from the freezer w the date that the food expires inside my burrito!!!! So I call John apologizes again says the same thing well I said okay I'll just take a break from there (lasted about a week) and there I am again back at ritos been going for about 2 weeks every other day now from the last incident and it's going good... till today!!! May 23, 2018 around 1:30pm I order the same bean burrito enchilada style park in their parking lot and as I go in for a cut a looonnnng big hair is being pulled by the knife coming from inside the beans/burrito!!!! At this point I'm furious and I'm disgusted that this hair incident has happened twice and 3 times them messing up inside my food!!! So I go back inside show the manager and a worker (some girl in green shirt taking orders) my burrito show him the hair and he pulls it out w the knife and says oh yeah it's inside there. I'm so sorry we lent roll our workers before they cook and they all wear hair nets... hair nets? With half their hair sticking out of the nets and some don't even have them on! He goes on to say how he wishes it didn't happen to me and he will return my money. I'm so disgusted and mad I grabbed my money and said I'll never be back here again! PLEASE BEWARE OF RITOS ON 14th st and ROOSEVELT BEANS! Obviously this isn't the first time this has happened and I'm sure there much more hair in that food of theirs!!!! Ritos definitely lost a loyal customer for good!!! 3 strikes your out!!!",

The shells are always freshly fried and made to order.   The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the anxiety I get when I walk in. It's cramped, busy, and slightly warmer than it is outside. I have pretty bad anxiety so I have to be in the right mood to go here. But it is always worth it.",

    "text": "Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders.",

If it weren't for my GPS I would've had a hard time finding it. It is in what seems like a lower income neighbourhood, but the people are fine. Cashier was VERY nice.  I ordered the Red Chilli Burrito Enchalada Style. It was pretty good. It was basically 3 layers of tortilla stuffed with diced chicken or steak then covered with a thin layer of cheese. Tasted pretty good. The chilli sauce was not overly spicy, just enough to get the taste buds going. All in all a good experience  P.S. I will going back tomorrow for a chimichanga :)",

So delicious and flavorful but you won't get that heavy, sleepy, mid-afternoon food coma that their burros tend to induce.  I echo all the negatives prior reviewers have mentioned: the staff is often rude, they only accept cash (seriously?), it's situated in a random not-so-nice neighborhood, and there's only crappy picnic table seating. But I still think the positives outweigh these significant gripes, I just recommend taking it to go and eating it back at the office! Mmm now I'm craving a guacamole tostada...",

On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude.   This family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell.   If you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit.  If only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great.

    "text": "It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.   I'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is True on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps.",

I got the plain green chili burro and was basically making my own enchilada-style with the sauce, guac and other toppings from my boyfriend's plate. It was amazing.   You pay extra for the enchilada-style, for guac, for cheese and even for extra hot sauce (it's homemade). Though still not expensive, the pricier your meal gets, the more delicious it gets. It's worth a bit more to add extra flavor to the burros, which I actually thought was rather plain without my doctoring.  Rito's is a cash-only take out place with some picnic tables outside, and at lunch time it was hopping with people. The only negatives I can see are that it's set up sort of like a bank teller, so you feel quite disconnected to the staff the whole time. I also couldn't find the bathroom to wash my hands after my messy food, nor could I find any extra napkins.",

Their beans are the runny kind, so adding the rice made the burritos easier for me to hold and eat. Their nicely seasoned fried chicken and beef tacos were the best (even the oily juices tasted light and fresh). I also regularly bought their delicious enchiladas.   The menu isn't huge and they don't stay open all night. I think that is SMART.   Ritos is just another one of those very unique places that you come across every so many years. You won't find the same type of food anywhere else, so you wish you could take Ritos with you if you move away.   It's like your mom's cooking. No one else will cook dishes quite the way she did.

Also, don't you love that little mound of lettuce they put on your plate as if that makes it healthy or pretty or something? Try picking through that after driving your food home in a to-go box.

The beef taco with guacamole is good and is the bean burro. All the workers seem happy and friendly all the time. The place is ran well - it's a staple. My brother had one last meal today before he moves to Denver. What did he choose? Rito's.

    "text": "This place is affectionately called the \"soupy burro\" around the office. On my way there, my fellow lunchies warned about three things:  1)Be cautious of the aluminum plate they serve the burro in, its 2 degrees hotter than the deepest realm of hell and will singe your arm hair if you get too close.   2)The enchilada style burro with a side of beans is two parts molten lava, one part devils breath and two parts awesome. Be warned.  3)If you happen to get the burro traditional (without enchilada sauce) try it Gary style.(He's a guy a work) Get a side of rice with your burro and eat directly over the rice bowl because the burro WILL explode  at some point and it is better to catch the molten lava goodness with your rice than on your pants. Unless you want to melt your legs off.  All in all, it is good stuff. Small menu, outside seating, cash only, No sign on the building. Sometimes you have to arm-wrestle a junk-yard dog for a place to sit but its worth it.",

There is never, ever, anything bad about seeing a bunch of old ladies in the kitchen cheffing up the goods.  My personal favorite is the green chili mix burro. Tacos were awesome, but as long as the green chili, beans, and the perfect tortillas remain, I'm a major fan. I like sitting on the picnic tables with my paper plate and my can of fanta holding it down.   Bring cash. Be patient. I'd give five stars if they were open later. I've never seen them open on weekends. Anyone know if I'm going at the wrong time?",

When you go in, it's like going into someone's house and ordering from their kitchen.  This place is a total hole-in-the-wall.  Also important to note that it is a cash-only establishment.  They only serve burritos & chimichangas NO TACOS.  Their burritos are extremely runny but extremely yummy and will literally explode in your mouth.  I recommend ordering a dozen tortillas on your way out.    Check out Rito's when you're feeling adventurous and wanna hang out the locals in the barrio.",

There were a few minor negatives.  Service is a bit slow, no fountain soda and menu options are limited to burritos, chimis and a couple of tostadas, but as long as you know this going in you will be very happy.  Bottom line = Great food at reasonable prices.    They were also serving Tacos when I was there 8/3/09.  I've noticed some reviews say they stopped serving them, but they must on occasion.  They are not back on the menu, but they had a cardboard sign at the counter stating that they were for sale that day. Lastly, it has been stated in other reviews, but in case you missted it Rito's is Cash Only.",

    "text": "I had heard much of the mythical burritos at Rito's.  I'd just never passed by it or knew where it was so I always forgot to seek it out.  But I am kookoo for cocoa puffs about green chile and had heard this place had the best in town.  One day recently, I was driving around the Garfield district looking for a possible new pad as I want to live downtown.  I was driving up and down each block looking at rentals that weren't totally sketchy.  It's and up and coming area, but it's still a pretty rough neighborhood.  As I was driving down 14th st. past a grade school, I spotted people standing in a short line out the door of a converted house with picnic tables outside.  A light bulb went on in my head.  Aaaah, this must be that place they talk about in the magazines and papers.  Rito's!  It was 11:30, so I parked, which would probably have been difficult if I'd gotten there 15 mins later.  The menu is just burritos and tacos and beans pretty much.  There are plaques all over Rito's walls from year after year proclaiming it to be the burrito king of Phoenix.  I got a green burro and a side of beans, waited about 5 mins for my order and went out to a picnic table to dine in the sun.  I shared a table with some other folks and a pigeon.  They are not big on ambiance here.  What they lack in that, they make up for in pure, unadulterated burrito kick-assery.  The beans, hot as molten lava and a bit soupy, were the most flavorful frijoles I have ever, EVER tasted.   The hot sauce, heavy on the oregano, was lovely with good heat for me. The tortilla was thin and chewy with just the right bits of char kissing it.  The green chile filling, again a bit more soupy than I'm used to,  was just sublime.  I couldn't have eaten it without a knife and fork though, cuz it would have oozed all down the front of me.  Make sure you ask them for a knife and fork; they don't just put it in the bag.  They do take debit cards now, I guess it used to be a cash only business.  Boy, am I glad I just happened upon this mythical burrito abode!  I felt like I was in one of my friend's Nana's house at a family party.  This is down home Mexican food greatness...'nuff said.",

The sauce was decent, had a good kick, but there was wayyy too much of it with no chips to eat it with? SHAME on them for no chips and salsa!!!!! For $8 there was very little amount of beef inside swimming in green chile sauce-How did they get all that green chile sauce to stay in there!? We ate it on the picnic tables outside in the 107 degree heat while we got bitten by ants.  It's a pretty sketchy neighborhood, so I would make this a lunch time experience if you must try it for yourself.  Come packin' some heat if you don't want to end up like 'boys in da hood' LOL",

It's the ultimate hole-in-the-wall, and the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.  I have some thrilling news to share.  THERE IS ANOTHER RITO'S (opened by the son of the owner).  It's every bit as good and may be more convenient for you.  It's at 51st Ave. and Orangewood - Rito's Burritos in the little strip mall.  Naturally I tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same, right down to the oversized pie plate.  Ahhh...  Don't worry, for those that are concerned Rito's is going corporate, the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen, and although it has bathrooms, they are perpetually \"under repair,\" according to the glossy, pre-printed sign they've mounted on the wall.  And of course it's still cash-only.  So they have preserved that special charm.   I know this will make the line longer at the new place, but it would be unfair not to share the good news, especially when I learned about the original from here.  Enjoy!",

As a Phoenix native (45 years old) I have eaten my share of red/green chile burritos.  The ones at Rtio's are good, but not so exceptional to take the reins of best.  And, at $8 for a red chile burro enchilada style, it isn't so good to compensate for the cost.  I consider this kind of Mexican food peasant food, that is food that is inexpensive, that the poor could afford and enjoy.  $8 ain't it.  Look to Carolina's for a better value in this regard.  Does anybody remember La Tortillaria run by AZ foods on Washington?  That was a good burrito.  Rito's is good, not exceptional.  Rito's is expensive.  I wouldn't recommend this place over any other standard red or green chile joint nor would I discourage it.  Just be aware you will pay a pretty good sum for something that  tastes good, but is priced a little too high.  Final note:  Red and green chile is a very simple dish to make at home, and is very, very inexpensive.  A restarurant that charges more than $3 bucks is making a huge amount of profit on their dishes.",

Waited a good 15 mins, which sucked because the waiting area was so small! Ordered the green burrito, enchilada style and chips and salsa.  Waited another 25 mins before my number was called.  Their chips and salsa, Egh. Nothing to comment about, wouldn't get again. The burrito was delicious, with the guacamole it brought it up a notch. The only thing, there was more tortilla than cubes of meat. Maybe get it with beans too? The option was there.  Customer service was mediocre, they just hammered out the orders in robotic fashion. With the line out the door the whole time I was there, I get it. I mean, do they get pee breaks?!  I'm already thinking about going back Saturday. Only at 10am instead of 1pm. Maybe it won't be so bad??",

Oh, and I tried the online ordering through yelp for this place and it was so easy to use! This place gets PACKED for lunch so it was such a relief to just walk-in, pick-up my order, and head back to the office. The process was so smooth I might just stick to it moving forward.",

We would get all different kinds including the red chile, green chile, bean burritos and occasionally tostadas and tacos. We'd head home to my dad coming from work and my 2 sisters, brother, my mom, dad and I would half up the burritos between us sharing and delighting in the food.  My sister we would pick up has now passed. Towards the end of her battle with cancer all she wished for was a burrito from Rito's. I live in California currently and no other place has held a candle to Rito's in my heart. Because of the wonderful childhood memories I have of this place and for always being so friendly and being consistently good I give Rito's 5 stars and a heart. My sister I'm sure would agree",

I'm sure their other food is just as good (but I still keep eating just the green chili burros).  I would love to see more locations with later hours.

I have never read the menu, but would venture to guess that everything is delicious.  I order exclusively red or green burritos, as well as the guacamole taco.  Each burrito is made to order, and features homemade green or red chili, an Arizona-Mexican food staple.  I would highly recommend asking for a red or green chili burrito, mixed with re-fried beans.  Having moved to Seattle relatively recently, I pray that one day, a Rito's magically appears; however, until then, I will continue to make my annual pilgrimage to the Mecca!",

I usually opt for the green chili burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and beans. Only complaint I'd have to say is there prices are a bit steep.

    "text": "I've been going to Rito's since 1988. It is so authentic and delicious. It has a lot of spice so if you like Americanized Mexican touristy food, this place is not for you, BUT if you want the real deal, this is the place.  It's nothing fancy and in fact you have to take your food with you or eat on picnic tables outside, but it is really good food. I learned about Rito's when my son was in Phoenix Children's Hospital for multiple hospitalizations. Many of the nurses in the unit were always getting take-out from \"Rito's\" and after being there for a while, one of them invited me to place an order. That was the beginning of a beautiful relationship. I hit up Rito's whenever I am remotely near the area. My favorite is a mixed red and green chile burro enchilada style.  I'm only sorry that it took me this long to write a review because I have NEVER had a meal that wasn't perfection. It is too hot for some, but if you like spicy Mexican food, you will love this place.  It is NOT fast food; depending on the crowd will depend on how quickly you get your order, but it is worth the wait.",

We love this place so much that we even made a nospill game/rule with their famous red chili burritos; the shame was real if u spilled one drop of that heavenly spicy red sauce.

You know, back when (my hood) Coronado and Garfield neighborhoods were considered the ghetto instead of historic! :) That said, the building is small and traditional Mexican style with brick arches donning the ranch-style architecture and nothing more than a couple of plastic chairs to sit on while you wait for your order. I remember the days when this was the best kept secret in town, but I am glad they're gaining some more momentum and praise!   Quite simply, this is my favorite burrito of all time. Their beans are so delicious due to their salty, runny, lardy goodness, and I beg that they never ever change!  The tortillas that they wrap them in are heavy duty and freshly made and ever plentiful! There is nothing more original than these and nothing quite like them in the rest of the Valley! Hallelujah, Rito's burritos, you are fond memories in my past, part of the joy in my present, and I always look forward to you in my future!",

    "text": "I have been coming to Ritos since whn they 1st opened.  I know a couple of the family members.  Although I don't go often, it is hands down the best place to get anything green.  It's alittle hot for me so I always get it mixed with their delicious beans.  Whn I get it enchilada style(almost always) it's so big and filling, u don't need any sides with it.  But the rice is also very good.  Now the meat they use is big chunks and very tender and the green chili has so much flavor but it is spicy hot for me.  Now I have eaten in a lot of Mexican restaurants trying to get that same taste from other green chili burros and in different states( NM, CA and Texas) but there is no comparison and there \"enchilada style\" is like no other and I doubt u will ever find it like tht anywhere.  It's the cheese,  it's almost like a good pizza combined with the tasty red sauce.  I have tasted some of the other dishes like the tacos which are very good but I wish those were bigger.  I just crave more.  Thts why I always go back to the green burro enchilada style.  It fills u up and it's damn good.  And they finally went plastic.  I have been waiting for that to happen for years making Pete's Fish & Chips the last place tht only takes cash. Lol.  So go eat at Ritos and experience this place for yourself.",

First I asked them what they were known for and the lady told me their burritos because their beans were amazing. So I thought I was getting a burrito with beans and rice. What beans? No rice, no beans, it was literally just 4 chunks of meat and runny sauce, I had to get a spoon to eat it. I paid $5 for some sauce and 4 chunks of meat and a flour tortilla. I didn't even want meat, I wanted beans. I tried to go inside to talk to them about it but there was a line out the door. What a rip off. The place is obviously making a killing and yet they have no sign outside, no menus with descriptions, extremely limited menu, no a/c, limited drinks (they didn't have all the drinks because they were waiting for a shipment.) What a disaster. Someone is raking in huge profits and obviously mismanaging this place. But go ahead and call them \"authentic\" no thanks, there are better places.",

The rice had great flavor but was a little to mushy for my taste.  I prefer my rice more on the dry side. We ordered a green chili burrito enchilada style and the green chili was FANTASTIC!  I wasn't asked if I wanted it with red or green sauce and so I found out that they made it with the red. I was disappointed about that because I thought the green chili had green chili sauce.  The other disappointment was that the burrito was kind of deflated.  It barely had anything in it so it was more like eating a tortilla in every bite without the green chili.  For the cost of it I would have expected to get at least more green chili if they wanted to skimp on the beef.  The little green chili that I did get was delish!.  I will try it one more time but if I get another empty burrito, I will have to skip it.  Don't want to have to do it but I don't want to get teased. I still want green chili damn it!",

    "text": "I took a few staycation days this week and made a list of things I never have time to do.  Getting food @ Rito's was on the list.  I've lived in Garfield for 2 years, but I work outside of the neighborhood from 9-5, so I'm never around during Rito's business hours (according to a sign inside, M-F, 9-4).  I rode my bike over on a fine, sunny Friday around 12:30.  I approached from the south, so I could see the patio seating.  If you approach from Roosevelt St., it's easy to miss this place!  There's no signage of any kind, but lots of people parking and waiting outside.  The atmosphere is absolute hole in the wall.  You order through a window with bars at the counter, which is a practical arrangement for the location.  Garfield is pretty chill these days, but that has not always been the case.  There are chairs along the wall for your waiting pleasure, but not nearly enough and they get snagged quickly.  There's a limited menu, but the day I visited, there were 4 specials written on a chalk board.  I am an enchilada girl, so I was pretty happy when I saw them on the specials board.  I know burritos are what Rito's is known for, but I figured I could come back any day and try a burrito.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a side of beans.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  I put it in my bike basket and pedaled home in anticipation of a great Mexican lunch.  The enchiladas were generous, but the sauce was not nearly as tasty as the sauce at Carolina's.  And the enchiladas were pretty greasy.  The beans were soupy and delicious.  I will not order the enchiladas again, but I will go back and give the burritos a try.  The sodas are in cans, so I passed on a beverage.  I'm glad I didn't wait until next week to make my Rito's excursion, because a sign inside announced that they'll be closed all week for \"spring break.\"",

I was tempted to get the green burrito enchilada style because everyone on here said to. And everyone before me in line was ordering it. But I had exploring to do so I figured if I got something crunchy I'd be able to pick it up and eat it in the car.   I got back to the car and opened my rice and bean chimichanga expecting it to be a regular sized fried burrito and omg it was huge! It was topped with sour cream and guacamole  so I thought I would just cut it all up and then eat it as I drove. I took one bite. Then another. Then another. And before I knew it it was gone. And I hadn't even left the parking lot.   I feel ashamed. My only complaint is that this place is not in Sacramento.  Edit: I went back yesterday with the mom and we got a green chili burrito enchilada style. Couldn't resist. This time we ate outside. And it was yummy",

All seating is outdoors so you go in and order at the counter (you can get to-go as well). They are so popular there is always a line. DO NOT LEAVE. The line goes pretty quick (after 40 years in business they have ir down!) and the food is worth the wait.  The  menu is spilt up into burritos, chimichanga's, enchiladas and tostadas...all with amazing sides. For the veggie they even offered veggie tacos and other things.  I got a guacamole tostada and a taco. I will say their guacamole is some of the best I've ever had and the salsa just the right kick.   They are located right at 14th and Garfield in Phx and  been voted Best in Phx and Best Chimichanga too many times to count!   Go find them!!!",

It was sooo tender and flavorful that I could've eaten that alone. I would've enjoyed the burrito if it was crispy. If it had been in a press or a little crispy on the grill, I would've added another star to this review. The salsas were eh as I've had much better. I was really looking forward to having a Orange Fanta in the bottle but they ran out. They also ran out of Diet Coke in the can. If they run out, then take the cans/bottles off the shelf as it seems like they are available. The napkins are cheap quality as well. This is a messy meal and you need 1-2 heavy duty napkins!

The outside of this place looks sketchy but the food is sooo good! This place gets crazy busy, so you may have to wait a while for your food, but it's truly worth it. Please note, seating is very limited. This is a great takeout spot but not a very great dining in place. They do not serve any chicken dishes just beef. But their guac tacos are yummy! And are my fave. Anywho stop by if in the area! You won't regret it.",

    "text": "Yes, the green chile is very good. But the long wait can be difficult to bear and the burritos are approaching $6 a piece.   With that being said this is some of the best green chile I have had in Phoenix. It is mildly spicy with fresh onions and tomatoes, and lean chunks of tender pork. I certainly appreciate that the meat is not accompanied by layers of fat, which I have experienced at other valley eateries. I must confess. I love me some tasty pig and this slightly-too-thin sauce is just squealing for more. Nearly double would be about right.   Rito's also needs to add some combo plates to that barren menu. Give me a green chile plate with rice, beans, and flour tortillas for a bit more than a solo burrito and I will repeatedly frequent your establishment. Currently if you'd like some rice and beans with your burro you're lookin' at $8 plus for your lunch. This is not Scottsdale! Some claim that this place has \"the best\" beans. I disagree. They are a bit too salty and runny. On the other hand the rice is simple and satisfying. Also, while not made in-house and instead purchased from Mama Lola's, the tortillas are still quite good.   In a nutshell visit Rito's if you appreciate some tasty green chile and have lots of time to spare and patience to endure the long line and longer wait. I would recommend going early or late to avoid the lunch rush.",

There were hints of flavor past the salt, but not much.  My wife thought there was too much tortilla.  I slightly disagree,  I feel it helps the burro itself from getting to soggy, therefore I appreciate the amount of tortilla for texture.  We both agree not enough meat.  I think it's the novelty of the location that makes people like it more than they should. I too love the hole in the wall aspect of it.  Tucked in a side street, no sign.  Take out or eat outside.

They are located in a neighborhood and as of the time we paid a visit, they did not have a sign. It is a brick building that probably used to be a house, and we had to drive past it a couple times to realize we were there. They have a very simple menu, but I am not surprised they have found success with their amazing quality. We shared a enchilada style green chili burrito with beans on the side. WOW. It had cubed pork in it, but I was in love before I even hit any meat. The flavors are so delicious and all of the sauces together were perfect. The beans were super yummy and tasted very fresh and flavorful. We ordered a shredded beef taco that was a special for the day just in case the burrito wasn't going to be enough for the both of us, but it ended up just stuffing us until we couldn't breath. That taco was really good too! It seemed like they freshly fried the taco shell and they were very generous with the beef! Next time we will definitely be satisfied with just the enchilada style burrito to share since it was mighty large. Can't wait to come back for more!!",

My wife had a wonderful bean chimi, but again in comparisons with Azteca and others, there is no clear cut superiority to our thinking. So when we are near, we will check it out.

    "text": "Being from Las Cruces, NM which is about 30 minutes away from the Green Chile capitol of the world (Hatch New Mexico), I think that I can accurately judge the green chile burritos to be sensational. I'm not much of a pork fan, (excluding bacon of course) which is usually what is in the burritos, so I usually just order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Green is the only way to go in my opinion. The burritos are huge, and are filled with so much beans, cheese, and green enchilada sauce, it's overflowing as soon as you take the first bite. It's always hot because they make each order fresh, but be prepared to wait especially if you go between 11-1. I try to only go after 1, but it's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes even going after the lunch rush. So if you have only an hour lunch, and you work downtown, you better be a speedy driver. I usually only have about ten minutes to eat after driving over and waiting in line, so that's definitely something to take into consideration.  It's a little hard to find at first because there isn't a sign, and the business operates out of an old house across from a school, but you'll know you're in the right place when you see the line up of cars for a block. The staff is all very friendly, but there isn't a lot of waiting room inside, and there really isn't too much space outside to eat either, so it's more of a grab and go kind of restaurant, which I don't mind because I probably would not choose to stay and eat there either, but you're going there for the food not the experience.  The only other downside aside from the wait, and the lack of seating and cleanness, are that the green burritos are twice as much as the red ones because they are so popular. I personally think that this is ridiculous, but obviously everyone is still willing to pay for it. All in all it's a great little hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix, and a must try if you are craving some delicious green chile.",

Being that we love exploring and trying new places, this is probably one of my struggles in \"What is authentic and what is not?\" having friends to help you sometimes is the best coconut wireless you can ever have...lol!  My son was visiting us from (808) for fall break and his only request is to eat \"Some real authentic Mexican food\" We have been to a few and we do have our regular places that we go but, I wanted to take him somewhere we have never been too and Rito's Mexican Food was a huge hit as far as referrals and so we did.  It's a small place, family owned business, very busy doesn't matter what time of the day it is, lots of place to sit and eat, but their portions are humongous...lol!  I had their Enchilada plate with rice and beans, they filled my bowl plate too the top but, every bite was sooo good. The cashier said it would be spicy but, it wasn't that bad as I can't eat spicy or I'm not sure if my taste buds are changing to acquire the spicyness. My boys had their burrito plates and they were sooo happy to see how huge their portion was and it just made our day even better after hiking up Camelback Mountain early morning - Rito's Mexican Food it hit the spot.   Came home and crashed out for the entire afternoon...lol!",

Today, I ordered the bean and rice burrito and some chips and salsa. Their bean burritos are HUGE and so cheap! I couldn't even eat the whole thing, but it was delicious. Their salsa is really good, but spicier then most places and I'm not a baby about spice. So if you are sensitive to spice, proceed with caution!   My coworker got a guacamole taco which I tried, and it was SO good. My other coworker swears by their green chili burritos, but said they definitely are messy because the sauce is super thin. Just plan to eat it with a fork! I'm excited to go try this place in person and get a little more ballsy with the entrees!",

If we ever come back to Phoenix Arizona we will definitely stop at Ritos again.  Very limited Vegan/Vegetarian options.

On top of burritos they also have tacos (but only on Tuesdays) and a couple other items. The menu is very simple and everything is homemade.

This is what I order EVERY time I'm here. This thing is MASSIVE!!!! It's not that spicy, but it certainly has a little kick to it. It is absolutely delicious and I hate that I love this place so much.  Rito's is a local, family owned joint. This place gets crowded during lunch hour and there's very, very limited waiting room inside as well as very limited parking. There's a small private lot as well as street parking. There are a few shaded eating tables outside for those who enjoy burning in the lovely Arizona heat, but there are zero tables to eat indoors.  If you usually take your lunch at noon, I recommend calling in your order in advance or placing it online!   I'm gonna miss Rito's!",

This is a place the Yelp is good for. There is no way you will find this driving by as its off the main road and has no sign on the outside. The only indication was the line of people going out the door.    Seating is limited to some dilapidated picnic tables on the adjacent patio.   The menu board is quite simple only listing burritos and chimi changas and tostadas, apparently there are some off menu options that are not posted.  I ordered the a bean chimi changa, It was a bean burrito deep fried and then dolloped with guacamole and sour cream there was cheese sprinkled on top of this. It was served on a small bed of shredded lettuce in a white container.  The Beans are flavorful and runny like a bean dip, the fried tortilla was great a it should be, the guacamole was a neon green fake variety and the sour cream was cold and firm .   There were down sides, the price was a bit steep considering the location, potion size and lack of seating. They ration the hot sauce and charge $.15 for a thimble or $.50 for a small cup.  Drink are cans of soda only. And the line was long and poorly structured. this is why it only gets 3 stars, the food is good but the drawbacks hurt it.   Also Note CASH ONLY",

All that said, i dream about their food and curse them for not being open on the weekends!    The green chile anything is good, I get just a bean and rice burrito and then add green enchilada sauce.   I would drink that green sauce by the buckets if i could. I even asked if i could order just the sauce for to-go and they told me no.  BOO!  Bottom line if you are adventurous and like mexican food this is your place.  One more tidbit I am pretty sure the green sauce is not vegetarian, but that has not stopped my veggie friend from still eating eating it.  She just picks out any chicken in the sauce she sees! ha ha  That is how much she likes it!",

Rito's only offers one thing... the best traditional, home-style Mexican food the Valley has to offer. Simple, tasty and made with pride and care. It is pretty much a take out place although they do have a small amount of patio furniture outside for when the weather is nice.   Anyone who knows will tell you that Rito's has had the BEST green chili burros you may rver find although everything they make is above average. The prices are all very reasonable as well. I can feed my family of 4 for only $20.00!  So if you are in the valley of the sun and aren't an ambiance snob... give Rito's a try. You can't go wrong!",

You order at the window, pay, and move to the side with everyone else and wait for your food. It's a bit of a wait, but wow, you won't be sorry for the wait. I got the green chile burrito, enchilada style. Now, I can't tell you what makes it so good, it just is. It's messy and absolutely delicious!

You'd never know it was there since it's not on a major thoroughfare. And it's on such a quiet street that you'd probably drive by thinking it's just someone's house. The only giveaway is the small courtyard with the picnic tables next to it.   I unfortunately discovered Rito's too late in my time living in Phoenix. I only ate there a handful of times before I moved. They have what I call the diarrhea burrito (unfortunate nickname, I know), not because it causes stomach upset, but because it is so wet that if you are a newb and try to eat it off the plate, its contents will inevitably gush out of the bottom and onto your lap in a rush of sauce and meat. Like a burrito with diarrhea.   All of the burritos are wet burrito style. I prefer the green to the red. It's huge, so if you forgo extras, like rice/beans on the side or chips and guac, that might be a smart idea. Unless you are sharing a plate or going family style.    Make sure you do not try to eat this burrito as a wrap-style. It's wet, and its wrappings with safely ensconce it until you puncture it, in which case it WILL mess everywhere.",

Amazing.  A couple of things to remember about Rito's: -No inside seating, which makes it difficult in the summer. -No credit cards accepted. -They are always busy, so expect to wait. -No use in calling in an order. Every time I have I have waited anyway.  The last time I was there, my lunch companion said \"I love Carolina's, but this really is the best Mexican food in town.\" Even though I am a HUGE Carolina's fan, I have to agree.  P.S. Word on the street is they occasionally make tacos. If anyone wants to tip me off on taco day, I would greatly appreciate it!",

I went along with the many suggestions on Yelp and ordered the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style. I also ordered a side of Refried Beans. They were both full of flavor and worth every penny. I don't mind the price so much if my Mexican food is worth it!   The amount of food was enormous! I had enough for a snack the next day!

You're really not working with my intentions of \"getting into shape\" and \"eating better.\"    Oh well, you are so delicious.    Rito's is a cute little hole in the wall in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  In my younger, less adventurous years I wouldn't have stopped here.  I would have missed out.  They only have a few options - red chile vs green chile, burrito vs chimi, rice and beans or no.  That pretty much covers it.  But what they lack in variety, they make up for in quality.  It's gooey, cheesy and delicious.  My personal favorite which I get nearly every time is the green chile chimi enchilada style.  If you don't know, enchilada style means smothered in sauce and cheese.  Sure it's messy, but it doesn't get any tastier.  Don't believe there is indoor seating, so you are left either taking it to-go or sitting on their outdoor patio.  That's all well and good when it is 70 degrees out.  But 100+ with humidity?  I'll take mine to go for now.    Definitely worth a try if you enjoy mexican food.  My only other complaint is that they close early (4pm, I believe) so dinner is not an option.",

I was freaked the hell out through my entire meal wondering if I should really be there. I grew up around these people, in Maryvale, and regularly go to Sunnyslope and have no issues. Maybe it was the fact there were no other white people nearby, and I was in the middle of a residental neighborhood, which made me feel as though I had walked into some gang's territory.   I was still able to eat my meal though. I ordered the red chimi enchilada style. OH SNAP! That was the best chimi I think I have ever had. The food here is not eally cheap perse, but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything. I wholeheartedly felt that I would go back on a regular basis if not for two things 1) it weren't in the location it's in and 2) it weren't so high fat.  At least go try it once, and take CASH.",

Expect the line to be out the door and you are probably going to have to wait a minute to get your lunch; because this is the best damn hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint in the valley. If you have a tourist and want to really give them the Barrio Burrito experience, this is it. Everything is well worn-in and the look of things might scare off the meek gringo. But it is exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. The Chimichanga shouldn't be eaten any further than 20' from the front door, if you don't have time to eat it there: take another look at your life's priorities or order something else. I've had the amazing Red Chili Beef almost every visit, but last time had the Rice & Bean Chimi which may be a new veg fav. The beef tacos are those amazingly greazy corn shells that may or may not be totally deep-fried, order extra hot sauce and don't ask silly questions. Rice & refried beans are just as they should be and even make a tostada delicious! They sell bags of fresh tortilla & chips, but I've never seen nachos on the menu. Everything they do have on the menu though is best-in-class, assuming you like this class. If it's the middle of the week like between 11 - 4, I've got a $20 bill and a hankering for Mexican Al Fresco - Rito's. Who's down?",

You must be able to 'move,' in a real neighborhood so if you are the 'coorprate,' type, keep your sorry behind in the hotel! If you are, however, a real person who likes real mexcan, A Rito's burro is as good as it gets!   PS-really friendly customer service, and sweethearts behingd the counter make for an even better experience!",

Their menu may vary from week-to-week but their awesome Green Burros is always on the menu so I'm happy.  No indoor seating which is the only thing I hold against Rito's.  Great for picking up and eating somewhere else.",

Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there. Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick. With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix. I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer.",

The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)",

My bf absolutely loved the place, especially the burros with chile verde and the chimichangas with red sauce. The tacos were great too. We sat outside and it took a while to get the food, but it was worth. I think it was the best meal I had while in that area. The only thing is that it's a little hard to find. I had a car with navigation, so it was a piece of cake, but it's tucked away in a neighborhood, so unless you're intentionally looking for it, you won't accidentally drive by it anytime.",

I got annoyed and thought ok, they better not be making this place to sound better than it is. So lunch comes around and they return with our massive lunch order (I suggest calling in group orders ahead of time or ordering online) and damn, they were all right.

You won't find them this good anywhere else. no matter what I get, I always get a side of rice and beans because they are amazing.

Look for the metal gated doors - that is the entrance. There is no parking lot, you just have to find a spot to park in the street.  My coworkers and I arrived here about 11:45 today, thinking we were going to beat the lunch rush, but we were wrong. The person in front of us ordered about TWENTY burritos to-go, so it took our food a pretty long time to get out. I would say we waited about half an hour, which kind of sucked. But the food was really good just like all the other reviews say! I ordered the rice and bean burrito with green chile sauce. I think $8 for a burrito is pretty fair, especially considering I could only eat half for my lunch and will be eating the other half for dinner tonight. Plus it's always nice to support a local business. Next time I think I'll try the enchilada.  Oh and they only take cash and they seem to run out of coins frequently, so if you have exact change that is even better. And there is no seating inside. I think they have a few tables on a patio outside, but most people typically take their food to-go.",

There is no sign and it looks like an old house. But with all that being said: I would still recommend it. I LOVE RITOS!",

    "text": "I have to start by saying Rito's is some of the best Mexican food I have ever had.  However, on many occasions including the last 2 visits, they failed to include part of the order.  I work in an office and we do tend to have a larger order than most.  The second to last order they forgot 4 orders of refried beans.  At $2.95 per order of beans, that's like $12 of food we didn't receive.  We talked to someone at the restaurant and they promised to make it up to us on our next order.  So that day is today and low and behold, we go to pick up our order and while checking the order in the car before pulling away, they have forgotten an order of tortillas!!  It's a good thing we had not left yet and have learned our lesson about checking our order.  A word to the wise, check your order for accuracy before leaving the establishment!!  *** Update ***  They also did not include a green chili burrito on the most recent order.  We'll be taking our business elsewhere.",

I go for the green chile beef mixed with beans, enchilada style...it's a gutbomb but so worth it.  No indoor dining area, no alcohol, and no sign...I think that adds to the charm to be honest.    I do have just two gripes though...it takes FOREVER to get your food. 15 minutes minimum up to 40 minutes a few times when it was really busy. It seems like they don't try to complete smaller orders when there's a huge order in...so if someone orders 10 burritos for their office right in front of you, you're not eating until those 15 burritos are done and out the door.  My other gripe is the amount of meat in the burritos...there's barely any! But again, the tortillas and beans are really the stars of the show.  I highly recommend this place but be prepared to wait and don't expect a bunch of meat!",

    "text": "Pretty impressed.  Great value for the price you pay.  Not everything I had was a home run, but a truly legit Mexican take out spot.  I had recently seen the Check Please AZ segment and read the Yelp reviews about this place.  I live downtown but up until now I didn't even know this place existed.  So I decided to stop by at opening on Saturday morning.  The location is exactly what I expected.  A divvy hole in the wall in the middle of residential street in the Garfield District.  The only parking is in the street and the building isn't labeled so be sure to know the address of this place in advance.  I had heard this place was typically busy at lunch during the work week but expected to get in and out pretty fast on a Saturday.  Uh, no.  The line was 12 deep when I arrived which was just 5 minutes after 10am.  The crowd in line was super diverse (white, black, hispanic, and even asian folks) so clearly word has gotten out about this place.  I believe you can call in your order if you wanna run by and pick it up rather than wait in line like I did.  So after about 10 minutes in line, I got to put in my order.  The dish that seemingly everyone talks about as Rito's 101 is the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style with Red or Green Sauce (I went with Red).  A family friend raved about their refried beans so I got some of those in the bowl as well.  Total price was $10 (FYI, they take credit and debit cards now so its no longer cash only).  Took about 20 minutes to get my food.  It's strictly a takeout place, but they do have a tiny amount of seating outside the building.  Being that it was a warm summer day when I went, I decided to just make the 5 minute drive home to eat.  Alright to the food.  Portions are huge.  Burrito comes in a huge bowl and was oozing red sauce with beans on the side (see my photo).  Smelled divine.  I've had a lot of burritos in my time, but this is up there with some of the best I've had.  Great chunks of meat mixed in with Hatch green chiles.  The red sauce and cheese complimented the tortilla very well and the sauce wasn't as watery as I had feared.  Great burrito all around.  The beans on the other hand were a disappointment.  Maybe its just me, but I prefer my refried beans to have a little more chunkiness to them.  Rito's beans are almost more of a puree.  The taste is fine, I just prefer to taste like I'm biting into actual chunks of beans.  All in all, I was impressed at the size and quality of the food I got for the money.  As busy as it was today, I can't even imagine how busy it gets during the work week.  Next time I come here I'll try to call ahead and maybe give the chimichangas a whirl.  Would certainly recommend this spot if you're in the neighborhood.  And if you're still hungry after eating one of their burritos, its your fault.",

I finally made it over spring break and it was fantastic! I never would have known this place existed without Yelp, as the building is on a side street and doesn't particularly look like a restaurant from the outside. Anyway.... once you approach the location, you'll know you're in the right place by the long line coming out the door.... It's that good. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili pork chimi, a guac and beef taco, a cheese enchilada, and chips and salsa. Everything was tasty, but the green chili was by far the best. It was just the right amount of spicy and flavorful. I would highly suggest going to try the green chili pork in any form... you can thank me later. I will be back ( schedule permitting :-P)!",

If you are new to Ritos, know what you are there for before you go, this is overall an assembly line order, pay and pick up, and get out so the line out the door can move inside a bit more.

Unfortunately for me I work in North Scottsdale and this place is only open M-F during lunch hours.   Ritos is pretty much a hole in the wall.  The screen door entrance in a neighborhood setting makes you wonder if you have the right place or will be walking in on a family sitting in their living room watching television.  There is no seating inside and only a few options on the menu.  I ordered the green chili burrito with rice and beans which was one of the best I've ever had.  The meal had probably about 2,000 calories and was worth every bite!  There is picnic table seating outside which would be perfect this time of year...summer, not so much.

Well we truly could NOT wait. We had to pull in at the parking lot of a church, not one block away from there because the aroma was just too much! Honest!  Rito's wouldn't be as fun without the Soup-Nazi attitude of the people running the joint.  I think it's hilarious. It's a Phoenix landmark and a MUST for out-of-towners.  And they CAN be that way to us. They can require cash only. Make you keep your mouth shut unless ordering EXACTLY what is on the VERY LIMITED menu and nothing more.  As far as ordering goes, I ought to add that the word \"ordering\" is misleading. We don't \"order\" our lunch at Rito's. We request.  These people are serious and so am I. I want my bean/cheese/enchilada style and I will do whatever it takes to get it. Don't come with me and get an attitude with them or I'll rip your head off. I will NOT be 86ed from Ritos on account of you! But you can cry on my shoulder as I wolf down my burrito. I understand.  Only thing I want to correct, which I think is unfair in some other reviews: the neighborhood isn't as bad as people like to say. Yeah there is gang activity, but come on. When was the last time some innocent person just getting their lunch was assaulted or shot in the Garfield neighborhood?  Can't remember? That's because the trouble makers usually make trouble for themselves and each other and don't usually bother the rest of us.   Bottom line, if you can't handle central phoenix, stick with your local tacobell/pizzahut/kentuckyfriedchicken drive thru in anthem.",

My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.  First of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.  Tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.  I love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.    I think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.  So they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.  As far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables.   They are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think.   They're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.  I think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.  Right now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.  BTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. Ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit.",

Rito's has been in the same location on 14th street for a long long time... I think around 30 years. There isn't a sign outside...you just have to know it's there.  Just look for the people walking out with smiles on their faces and to go containers in their hands.  When I was there for lunch it was filled with city workers, parents with young kids, and retiree's who live in the neighborhood.  Rito's is family owned, and honestly, I think grandma does the cooking. Also, it's cash only.   You pretty much have to know what you want when you get to the order window because the place is packed and they don't have time to answer your questions about what's in this and what's in that.   After asking the other patrons in line what's the best,  they pretty much all said the same thing...Green Chili Burro...I think it was less than five bucks. I also ordered the beans and rice. My husband ordered the same thing. There was so much food that we could have easily shared one with all the extras...I guess we figured since it was so cheap it's be small...no way...HUMONGOUS!    We took it to go and ate it in the car...cheese, beans and rice were flying every where, the windows were steamed up...the car was rockin' cause we were soooo happy...I'm sure passers by thought something kinky was goin' on inside our car. Nope...just chowin' down on some damn good Mexican food.   I hope I haven't given it away and blown the secret of Rito's by Yelping it...I love the fact that there isn't a sign, you have to know about it to know that it is even exists and it's a locals only kinda place.  The prices are right, the food rocks and it's family owned...what more could you ask for?",

    "text": "I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to \"the hood\" for some really good food.  Lunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).  My favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style.",

    "text": "A friend told me about Rito's, referring to it as reminiscent of Seinfeld's \"The Soup Nazi\" place.  Okay, so there is no surly Eastern European dude barking at you, but it does have the whole waiting in a long line, preparing a head of time what you'll order, and leaving with a delicious meal feeling.    Yes, this place is busy. Depending on when you go, there may be a line outside the building, and a tedious wait.  But all of that is in comparison to the heartbreaking, taste-bud savoring meal you will have.  I've had their infamous green chile burro and their just as famous (I think everything on the menu is famously good) bean burro.  And, of course, both have been enchilada style.  I can't even imagine not having their complexly flavored sauce smothered all over my burros. My next menu try?  Well, they aren't even on the menu, but their tacos.  I guess you just have to ask for them, and if they made them that day, you can claim it to be your lucky day.   The portions are huge and the prices are small.  A great business model, in my opinion!  And, I'm sure one of the many reasons why people keep coming back to Rito's. I know I will be!",

Every time my coworkers get Rito's takeout there's a buzz around the office, aroma of delicious chili and for the first time all day complete silence on the floor...but I'm not sure it lived up to the hype entirely.    My first piece of advice was delivered with a VERY serious face, \"It's in the ghetto. Do. Not. Stay. There. You MUST take it to go.\"   OK, people, 14th St. and Roosevelt is NOT the ghetto.  Maybe it's because I live downtown and the first time I lived alone I had to honk at the sleeping bum to roll out of my parking spot...but seriously, this place was clean enough and had a cute little \"patio\" with picnic tables filled with lunching professionals...which isn't always a good sign.     I ordered the green combo beef/bean enchilada style.  Why not go the gusto?  We waited less than 10 minutes and had piping hot food all the way back to the office.    The presentation was exactly what I expected; a full burrito slathered in melted cheese and swimming in red sauce.  The flavors were pretty good and the meat surprisingly tender.  The tortilla was soggy in the right spots and held up to all the sauce.    I have to admit I ate all of it but I may still be paying the price...trying to rally the 3pm lull is tough after a lunch like that and dinner is impossible.    It was good but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype or chant.",

It wasn't bad or anything, but I didn't really enjoy it and almost didn't want to finish it. I told my friends this and they disowned and vowed to never talk to me again. I decided I better try to save my friendships and make sure my taste buds didn't die or something so I went to Carolinas the next day and their food was amazing as usual. So apparently something is wrong with me because I don't think Ritos is the greatest ever and now my friends won't ever talk to me again.

When I asked him what to expect, he was correct in saying: \"Don't worry dude, just get the green on green with a taco on the side and watch the hood life unfold.\"  He was CORRECT!  This place is in the hood and they open at 10:30am for lunch.  The lines get long at about 11am.  They have a video game from the 80s while you wait. They serve drinks in THE CAN so I would suggest getting a 32oz thirstbuster beforehand.  If you go in the summer, you will be HOT in the summer heat as the only place to sit are at the picnic tables located OUTSIDE of course.  If you try to alter your order, you will be SCOWLED AT by the cashier.  However, if you treat her with respect, she will say something in spanish to the old heavy hispanic lady in the kitchen who stirs the chili and the fat lady will either NOD or shake her head.  All in all - a great place to eat!!",
