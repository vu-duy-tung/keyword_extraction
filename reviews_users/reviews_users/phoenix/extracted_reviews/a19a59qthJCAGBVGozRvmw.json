They ended up giving a discount which was nice but I'd rather have had my food in a timely manner.",

The lengua street tacos for $1.75 each were delicious; the meat was moist, flavorful, and plentiful. Filling flavors were well balanced and spiced. My friend enjoyed her carnitas tacos, saying they were succulent and had plenty of meat. The \"pre-made\" house margaritas on the rocks were surprisingly good and $4 during happy hour. They have covered outside seating at picnic tables. You order at the counter, and they bring your order to you. Service is friendly and fast, and the interior is large with plenty of seating. This will be a regular stop.",

They use tilapia for the fish, so I didn't have any.  The offer an green and red sauce both were spicy.  Excellent price less than $2 per street taco.  I had the combo with beans and rice.  Really cute decor.  The paintings are really colorful and fun.  I didn't have any but they serve margaritas etc   Our server Veronica was well Informed about gluten free options and was very helpful and friendly",

They were fantastic so I stopped here to pick up dinner for my husband and myself after work.   Service was friendly and time was appropriate for a \"to go\" order.  Street tacos were awesome -had the al pastor and they had great flavor. We also had the super nachos. We didn't add any meat to them but I will do so next time. I also ordered the chile relleno.   No complaints - the only feedback was the that the bin of limes only had two left and they looked a little sad :). It was close to the end of the night so I'm sure that's why it hasn't been refilled.  Overall, the meal was great and we will be returning.",

I called in my order on taco Tuesday and was informed it would be 30 min before it was ready. No problem, I understand. I put in two orders, but the person on the phone couldn't give me our totals because she was in the back room. Ok again, no harm done. When we got there only one order was ready. One of the women behind the counter was unfriendly the other just seemed disheveled. My 4 taco order was mashed into a tiny paper bag (why not a plate?) 3 tacos in one aluminum foil (?!). The communication about the second order was lacking, but after asking a couple times we were told the unfriendly one would put it together right now. As for the taste- I'd put it at a 2. The tortillas had an strange sour taste, the shrimp was overcooked, and the beans were just odd. I was going to eat them anyway, but I found two pieces of something I can't define in there. Looked like small worms though I'm hoping they're not. Straight to the trash. Tacos were eaten reluctantly. This place ought to shape up because the whole experience was no good.",

I like authentic hole in the wall restaurants rather than something nice like this place, but this place really impressed me. I was in the area and hungry for some menudo/pozole and tacos. I ordered 1 asada taco and 1 lengua, al pastor quesadilla with rice and beans (to share and take home) and a pozole. My spouse got 2 tacos and menudo. The meat was perfect, all of it. The tortillas could have been just a bit more warmer but it's alright the food went down to my belly in less than 3 minutes I think. Just so you know at this point I stopped being lazy and I'll continue with more about this place. The pozole was just on point with all the condiments to go with it. Menudo was just as good fyi I like my caldo's spicy so I put chili and oregano for more flavor. The green and red salsa both have a unique kick to them so I appreciated both. Oh and I'm eating my left over quesadilla now and it's bomb!!!! Last but not least the service was great and I also enjoyed the tv's!",

This location used to be a Qdoba, and later, a forgettable burger joint. There is plenty of space, and I thought it was interesting how all of their chairs are a little different. It gives the place some color and character.  I enjoyed the street tacos (carne asada and shrimp). I especially liked the carne asada, which paired well with the red salsa. They don't have much of a salsa selection here -- a red and a green -- neither of which is particularly impressive.   What is keeping me from returning is their portion sizes. I ordered the street taco combo and added another taco. I still left pretty hungry. I'm not a big guy (5'9, 172), and I think I'm finished growing outside of what I accomplish in the weight room (25 years old), but I would probably need to spend around $15 here to leave satisfied. That is not ideal with so many quality Mexican restaurants around.",

It's usually pretty clean inside when they're not in the middle of a rush, and when it gets busy it can sometimes take a while to get your order but I'd say it's worth the wait. The asada tacos are my usual go to, the refried beans here are different but in a good way, and I recently gave the super nachos a try, what a generous portion those are, the guac is pretty solid too and the horchata has a stronger cinnamon flavor than some other places but it's good. I've only been disappointed two times in the dozen or so times I've been here, the side order of chips I got were a little too salty once and the pastor tacos come with pineapple and they must've used the core for the pieces I got because it was impossible to chew. Those 2 instances aside I've come back a few time since and will continue to do so. Friendly staff too.",

The quality of this place has been going downhill for awhile now though. $1 Taco Tuesday switched to $1.75 Taco Tuesday which isn't even really a deal anymore for how small the tacos are. Tonight was the real disappointment though. $20 for two burrito bowls that were no better than Chipotle....hell maybe even no better than Taco Bell. Boring, bland, and with zero real redeemable qualities. They get the three stars for their former glory as the place I used to rave about. Will definitely be finding a new Mexican go to place.",

The only downside I can about the food is that the burritos are not big compared to other places in town.  Not to say that's a bad thing, if you're trying to each smaller portions, but who does that for Mexican food?  Decor is nice and overall clean.  I'll definitely be back since it's super close to my house.",

I love all their tacos, the meat is always cooked perfectly and each one has it's own unique flavor. It is great that they now have fish tacos as well. The only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is that I wish they would have real plates and glassware for the dine-in customers. So much trash and waste from all the styrofoam and plastic!",

Are you kidding me im walking back to my seat like no way. Then she goes to the back where the foods being made and comes back out. The lady that looks like shes in charge says you can go home and she says no ill stay and starts taking orders again. I cant believe how someone has no care in the world a out others. I will never go back and ill never tell anyone anything good about this place. Please do not contact me about what you can do to fix it either. A proper manager would have made her leave as soon as they knew!!",

Quick Tips:   - Pozole is served Sat/Sun.  We have a lot of favorite tacos places so its really hard to put this up near the top after one visit but this spot did have pozole since it was a Saturday and that's definitely a plus.  The broth could have had a little more spice but the meat was amazing and in large chunks.  Definitely recommend.  The carne asada tacos were good as well.  The meat was tender and still juicy.  Many people mentioned they are small but they are street tacos.  That's how they are suppose to be.  Rice wasn't anything to write home about but the sauces were good.  Overall the food was great, just didn't notice anything that set it apart.",

I also wanted a pomegranate margarita but they ran out of margarita mix. :(  Some good eats going on here.  I had the chile rellenos with rice and beans ($7) and it was great.  It was super cheesy and had excellent flavor.  The sauce paired with the poblano pepper led to a sweeter tasting dish which was great.  The rice was fluffy and not overcooked or mushy like other places and the beans had good flavor.  The red sauce they offer is also amazing and has quite the kick.  I also liked the warm flour tortilla served on the side with my chile rellenos.  That prickly pear margarita... strong.  That tequila got the Asian glow going!  The shrimp burrito with rice and beans ($9) was also decent.  Still not as good as my favorite burrito place but it was good.  Los Taquitos is an adorable place featuring some gorgeous art murals on the wall. Mismatched chairs fill up the space and there's plenty of lighting for your Yelp pics. Staff is friendly and the food comes out super hot. Enjoy!",

It was made in only a few short minutes and I was on my way!  The burrito was as good as I remember the al pastor at the Ahwatukee location. The marinated pork was tender with a slight amount of crispness along the edges. The flavor was deep, rich, earthy, with a tropical twist from the addition of pineapple. It was hearty and packed with meat, onions and sauce. The rice and beans were good too, and I was stuffed after eating half my meal. The total was a little less than $10. The order didn't come with any napkins or forks/knives in my to-go bag but since I was going straight home it was OK.  This location has a nicer layout and is newer so it's a definite winner for tasty Mexican food in Chandler.",

I had a taco platter: carne asada, al pastor, and fish. All were delicious. I loved that the fish wasn't fried. The steak for the asada was great quality and juicy. The pastor was pretty flavorful. The rice and beans were also really good. Most taco places can have really good tacos but their rice and beans suck- this place knocked it out of the park everything. Note that the beans are whole pinto. Their salsas were awesome and spicy. Great place to satisfy your Mexican food craving.",

I ordered a carne asada torta (Mexican sandwich) which was very good, although it was not cut in half like they usually are so it was a bit of work to get it unwrapped and cut myself since it got a bit messy. Overall the meat texture was good, not dry, and well seasoned.  I ordered a side of beans and rice which also tasted pretty good and were not too salty. The red salsa was very good and tasted homemade but the green salsa needed some work as it was bland.  My husband ordered four mini taquitos which were pretty tasty and came with onion and cilantro. I thought the cilantro was too light and had to go ask for a side but other than that it was good!  We also ordered a ceviche tostada (lime marinated shrimp) and that was very good as well! It was drenched in lime and had enough onion and spices to give it that authentic ceviche taste! Will definitely order another tostada at this location soon!",

The atmosphere was a simple yet unique with an eye catching mural on one side of the resturant. The staff was nice and friendly.   As for the food. The carne asada is nice and flavorful. The rice and beans were average and left a little to be desired compared to the main entree. If you are into sodas this place has only the essential sodas in their fountain such as cola, lemon lime, lemonade etc but nothing special. but they do offer old fashioned glass bottles of 4 Fanta flavors.  The price is well worth the amount of food you get! Less than $10 for someone to enjoy an entree with a sodie pop and leave feeling full.   I would recommend if you want some flavorful, quick and cheap Mexican food!",

Prices are also pretty good overall. You really can't beat the $4 margarita specials for happy hour Monday-Saturday from 4-7pm. Margaritas themselves tasted good, but man, were they STRONG! I wasn't expecting that, but it did pair well with the tacos. Staff was very friendly and service was quick. Worth going to, but be careful with the margaritas!",

    "text": "I feel like I come here every Tuesday!  Its cliche, but its for good reason. They have $1 tacos (chicken, pastor, or carnitas). They are served on corn tortillas by default, but you can opt to get the flour tortillas for the regular price of $1.75 a taco (I think).  Regardless if its Tuesday or not, this is a fantastic place. This place surpasses 95% of other taco joints without question. Its in a great location if you are getting your haircut and want food after etc. Its right by the 101.  Customer service is always fantastic. They are young, and you do have to have them repeat your order back sometimes to make sure they got the right thing (its a fast paced environment) here. The lines are always long, for good reason.  The ONLY thing I can say that needs improvement is the seating arrangements and cleanliness. Its a great thing that tons of people come here, but its PACKED around lunch time (12) and after work (6). I literally find myself racing another person trying to find a table as soon as someone gets up - so honestly one thing adds to another. The tables aren't cleaned alot, because the employees don't have enough time to clean them. Maybe integrate a table seating system like Liberty Market in Gilbert for example. They also have limited seating, but do an amazing job getting people in and out....all while still having a line to stand and order in like Los Taquitos!  Regardless, this is an amazing place. I'll forever be back - just wanted to add a tip and perhaps it'll get around to the manager or owner etc.  Food quality 5/5 Restaurant cleanliness 4/5 Customer service 4/5 Value 5/5",

Pricing was very reasonable. Bathrooms were clean.  Trash was full.  Beans and rice had unique but good flavor, and the three tacos all tasted good.  No objections.   Details :  The decor in this place is outstanding.  It looks like they were aiming to be quite a bit nicer than the average taqueria, and they succeed.   The tables are unique reclaimed wood pieces, and the chairs are fun too.  Tables were sticky.  The wall art in the place is incredible, wonderful artist.  The staff were friendly, with one staffer going the extra mile to ask me how things were and if I enjoyed the visit.    Feedback to management : The one negative about our experience, was the delivery of the food.  As each number was ready, the staffer would stand behind the counter and yell out the number.  AND I MEAN YELL!  The atmosphere in the establishment was great, but the yelling every few minutes was irritating.  Please invest in a table flag numbering system, it will really help the atmosphere.  The decor and food are right there, cutting out the need for staff to yell, should get you that fifth star!",

The meat was also very tough, dry, and lacking flavor. I will say though I have been here 15 other times and the language has always been absolutely amazing.

Plus the prices were so great, that what could go wrong?  I had one Veggie Street Taco and one Cheese Enchilada with verde sauce. My taco was suppose to be topped with onions, cliantro and salsa - didn't happen. The veggies consisted of onions, bell peppers and potatoes. Who puts regular potatoes in a taco?! My tortilla was dripping in oil, that I couldn't even eat it. The verde sauce on my enchilada was incredibly bland. Everything was meh to me.  Then I saw a sign for Taco Tuesday, $1 tacos! Talk about great price. BUT the real icing on the cake of this experience was that veggie tacos do not qualify for this special.   Overall, definitely won't return due to the lack of vegetarian options.",

I must say I was very disappointed with my visit to the new location in chandler.  It's down the street from me so was really excited to see it go up, but once there..... Wow they have some work to do.  Staff isn't very friendly.  My order was wrong and after reading other reviews this seams to be the trend at this location.  Some of my favorite food items are gone, but still ok considering everything I order is usually very good.  Prices are going up on items, and food portions are now getting smaller.  I ordered some asada street tacos and they were filled with mostly onion instead of meat.  $1.75 for an onion taco and a sprinkle of meat is kinda outrages.  I get it, the rent needs to be paid for new locations but don't ruin the experience for your regulars that have very gladly kept you in business for many years.  Ill try out the chandler location in a couple weeks to see if it gets any better but for now I'll keep going out of my way to the other location like I have been for years.",

    "text": "On holidays and looking for something different for dinner we decided on Mexican. We opted for Los Taquitos because it was close to where we were staying and we found information online that said Guy Fieri had visited one of their sister locations with good reviews. We browsed the menu online before placing our order in the store. The lady who took our order was amazing and soooo patient. This after my going through and taking the cilantro off and adding lettuce and cheese to three out of four of the menu items I ordered. Two of the people in our party ordered burritos (shrimp and green chile pork) and the other two ordered street tacos (carnitas and asada) and between us we tried the tostadas (carnitas and asada). The shrimp burrito was good with a little bit of spice (possibly in the wrap)?, my hubby enjoyed the green chile burrito but wished it had been a tad bit spicier. I had the carnita and asada street tacos which were delicious. The asada was so tender and so savoury, I am a big fan of the carnita but this time I completely favoured the asada. The tostadas were delicious - crisp shell, beans, meat, cheese and lettuce. My mum loved the refried beans, said they were the best she has ever had, the rice equally good. Our only complaint was that the guacamole was a bit bland but the rest of the food more than made up for that. We didn't eat in the restaurant but this place had a funky casual vibe so maybe that is something to try next time!",

Pork to me was the best and had best flavor. All tacos were pretty small but good. Got chips and salsa as well.  Chips seemed to be homemade. Very good. Salsa was very much like described, more of a pico de Gallo but had good flavor.  Rice was a little plain but good. Would recommend. Very busy on Tuesdays though so call ahead if you can.",

So now everyone is walking all over rice and food it's disgusting.  Some training is in order here they are now standing behind the cash register with no one in line,  a filthy floor and several filthy tables.  Having said that our burrito was delicious.",

Sometimes you go places on a holiday and they are not happy to be there but the staff was so nice. I love the street tacos, it's my favorite along with the chips and salsa. The price is average and the space is colorful and vibrant, very comfy and casual ambiance, yet fun! Side note: chips are so good with their green and red salsa! If you haven't been, this is a casual sit down place or a good take out option! It is old school Mexican style mixed with modern taste. I do appreciate that this place is always so clean!",

Price was very reasonable for all of the food you are getting.  Everything was wheelchair accessible.  Plenty of table and booth seating and inside/out seating.  Also accessible parking right in front.    I tried my husband's steak taco and couldn't believe the flavor of the steak.  It wasn't dry and it was perfectly seasoned.    Con:  Guacamole was a little thin/watery for my taste.  I prefer a little bit more salt as well and it tasted better after I added some.    Beans were not as tasteful as I had hoped; but everything else made up for it.   Even after the guacamole and beans; I would still give them a 4.5 star because of how amazing everything else tasted.",

I knew long ago they were special when I had my boyfriend pull over at the circle K because I needed more to drink because my mouth was on fire from their red salsa.  The locations and remodels are so beyond well deserved!  We wanted to get dinner tonight and I was craving Maskadores, my husband is not hooked yet so we chose our safe zone, Los Taquitos. Lucky us, it was Happy Hour! (My favorite time of day, amirite?)  We ordered 3 street tacos each, 2 kid meals, a house margarita and an IPA. BAM!  Dinner is served--- The food is flavorful, the pastor is SO yummy I regret not choosing all 3 tacos 'pastor but I decided to mix it up and order shrimp & fish also.  My only peeve of the night is they don't clarify if you want 'a la carte' or a meal. My husband and I just go for the tacos, rice & beans are extra carbs we can live without (Yea, I said it). So, $40 later, we are content, the service is great during dinner, lunch is hit or miss on service but this has been a long awaited review and I'm sure I'll be back soon.",

    "text": "My favorite mexican restaurant in the valley! I've been going to their Awatukee location for years, right after Diners, Drive-in and Dives featured it in an episode. I even drive to their 16st & Glendale location when in that area. If you like fresh, authentic mexican food, without a  mountain of sour cream, shredded iceberg and yellow cheese on top, you will also love their food.  I've pretty much tried everything. My favorite is the carnitas torta. The carnitas are not greasy,  they have a distinct flavor, with a hint of cinnamon. The bread is slightly sweet and just the right bite to it. Of the two salsas, the red one is my favorite. I wish they would bottle it for sale. Their chile rellenos are unique with really good cheese and chunks of potatoes with a flavorful but not spicy red sauce on top. Did I mentioned their margaritas? They are fantastic! Strong, good quality, without that after taste found in a lot of other places. My husband, the health nut, ultramarathoner  loves their trainer salad and bean burritos. On another note, I keep asking the cashiers, to ask the owners where they get their playlist music. I'm originally from Latin America and just love their selection of latin music.",

We ordered 2 house margaritas, shrimp bowl, chips n salsa, and 3 street taco plate. Took almost 20 min to get our food and they forgot our margaritas. So we got those after our food. Food was good but nothing to write home about. I think the prices are a little high for the amount you get. There also needs to be a sign that says where the line begins because there was a lot of confusion amongst costumers of where to go to order. I definitely think the location on Elliott is better but I hope this new location gets better with time.",

I don't eat beef or chicken so I only eat Seafood needless to say however our initial reason for coming to this side of town was to eat at Hash Kitchen but being that it's Sunday the wait is 1:30 min so we came next door.   My daughter and I eat at many different places. It's our way to try new places new food and just hang together   Let's just say she wasn't impressed either.    I get the same thing every Taquitos visit and the shrimp tacos were very sad. They place 3 small shrimps in a taco so it's not really a taco but an appetizer. They might as well just hand you the shrimp in a bowl. The Ahwatukee Taquitos puts at least 7, its a real taco. The food is still good but their presentation is horrible.   The people also working in Ahwatukee are a lot much happier. Not sure if the two times I've been in being the first was for my son but they seem very tired and unhappy to greet.   The food is fabulous at either but let just say if you want quantity visit the Ahwatukee location and see the difference.",

(Although, that is frowned upon during lunch hour w/ the boss, LOL!)   Co-workers are all obsessed w/ the street tacos, and they looked really good! I ordered the chili rilleno combo. And was a little disappointed it took twice as long for that... didn't get my food until almost everyone else had gotten their taco combos & finished. But, I appreciated that it was made fresh! And it was good. Not the best I've had, but not bad at all. It wasn't overly breaded, but there really wasn't a lot of cheese. So the flavor was lacking. Same with the rice & beans- there wasn't a lot of flavor, but still a good meal & not bad for around $10 total w/ a drink.   I'd definitely like to come back and try the tacos. And the portion sizes are plentiful for the cost! Generous servings, and mine came w/ flour or corn tortillas on the side. The homemade salsas are also pretty good- had to snag a couple to go!",

We stopped by for lunch in the early afternoon on a weekday.  The Plot: We started out by sharing a Breakfast Burrito with Pollo and a Carnitas Torta, which was followed by a bowl of Menudo.  The Scene: The restaurant was clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. The service was prompt and courteous.  All of the items we ordered were as appetizing as they look (see photos below) and the portion sizes for both were plenty for the two of us.  The Breakfast Burrito included a generous amount of all of the ingredients. The chicken was tender and juicy and the eggs and potatoes were also moist and tender.  The Carnitas Torta was especially generous in size. The shredded pork was tender, nicely seasoned, very flavorful, and I particularly liked the sauce.  The bowl of Menudo was plenty for the two of us and the level of spice was just right.  The Rest of the Story: This restaurant is a little pricey compared to a typical taqueria franchise but the quality is worth it. Some of the pieces of tripe in the Menudo were rather large and still somewhat rubbery, but it was still yummy.  Epilogue: My fiancee decided that she would like to stop in for lunch more often.

    "text": "One Taquito, two Taquitos, LOS Taquitos, four! That's right, you can't just eat one. You have to eat at least two!  To tell the truth we actually don't come here for taquitos, we come here for street tacos! Now that I think of it, I don't think I have ever seen a taquito on their menu. Go figure!  Their street tacos are so tasty and they don't hurt the pocket. At about $1.75 per taco you really can't go wrong! My favorite is the carne asada and my brother likes pastor.  The only taco I wasn't partial to was the lengua. The quesadillas are great too, they run about $4.90, but if you order from the kid's menu you can snag one for $4.00.  I don't think there is an item over $9.00 on their menu. They are so reasonable when it comes to their prices!  The biggest gripe I have about this place is the parking, which really isn't within their control.  Parking is a nightmare here during weekend brunch hours due to their neighbors to the east. Just be ready to take a walk from the other side of the parking lot when you visit Los Taquitos. Unless you are lucky enough to catch someone as they are leaving, you will be better off biting the bullet and taking a leisurely stroll from the parking lot to the west.   So if you find yourself low on cash and big on hunger, take yourself over to our favorite little taco shop right off of Price Road in Chandler! They will hook you up!",

That is, when we are not at Juan Jaime's that is. LOL  Los Taquitos is an order your food and drink, call out your number type place. But is it by no means a low rent, Chipotle wannabe. They serve great tasting Street Tacos, Carne Asada Bowl (photo) and yes, they even make a mean Margarita.  Their Top Shelf one is only $7.00 btw. Nice!  The only drawback so far has been their occasional order goofs. Now don't get me wrong, they are really, really, really very sweet, hard working and super friendly, which more then makes up for this short coming.   But there is some \"failure to communicate\", which we decided to just ignore at this point. So if it happens to you, just go with the flow. Do as I do, just consider it as an opportunity to taste another one of their dishes .  As I said, everything is delicious, as the line around noon time will surely indicate.  Tuesday is Taco Day, so bring your appetite for their Street Tacos (photos)which are only $1.39 each.  Nice!  Expect to pay $10 or so, depending on how thirty or hungry you are.   Enjoy!",

One has to order and wait for the food then pick it once the number is called. The walls of the restaurant has beautiful Mexican art and looks very captivating. I went with street tacos with rice and beans. I ordered carnitas, fish, shrimp and chicken tacos. The food arrived looking colorful. The tacos were very tasty and the ingredients used were fresh. I loved everything about the tacos, however the fish tacos my least favourite and so was the rice & beans. The best was the carnitas, it was juicy and really good.  I love spicy food, that being said, the downside was the spice level, all the tacos had a little more than required spice in them.   I loved the food here. The price is decent and costed me $9.50, overall a very good place for tacos.",

My son just had side of chips and their refried beans.  Rice was good but the beans and chili relleno was just ok. Poured the red sauce all over to give it better flavor. Red sauce is delicious!

It was a surprise change, IMO, and getting a mushy mess traumatized me. (I asked for it w/out potato the next time- but the damage was done and I got flashbacks lololol. I don't think I'm getting it again). Also their tortillas for the menudo taste weird (gross even) but the tortillas they use for tacos are yummy.",

That being said, being married to a Spanish man we decided to bring my mother-in-law here when she was craving Menudo before she flew back home!   We placed our order over the phone and was able to pick up immediately. The inside of the restaurant was very clean, open and very comfortable! The girls in the front were very happy, greeted us and made sure our questions were answered.  We all had the menudo soup! It was sooo delicious! This was my second time and my husbands 4th I believe. I love the fact that they had authentic condiments which included red onions, cilantro, lime, some oregano, and chili powder. This particular soup is an acquired taste, so if you are open to yummy slow cooked tripe then so for it!! Make it your own dish and add whatever u need! If you grew up with menudo, this will bring you back to grandma/moms home cooking!   For all 3 giant cups of soup we paid $19.00 and some change! Not including the tip.   They do have some other dishes! So if you have time go check them out! We will continue to explore more off their menu when we return!",

It's usually pretty packed on Tuesdays but the flavor/value is spot on so it's not a surprise.  On non-Tuesdays I've ordered other menu items like their carne Asada torta which I've always enjoyed and devoured quickly. Burritos are a hit or miss for me here, sometimes they're big and well portioned and sometimes it'll be on the skinnier, skimpier side. Service is typically friendly and energetic.   In a plaza that has some everchanging food spots, they have been around for a while now, just doing it up right with some good flavors and consistency!",

The cashier greeted us while we were looking over the menu but she had some attitude going on.. I was split between ordering the menudo and the posole, and she recommended I go with the posole.   We ordered one large posole (comes with your choice of tortilla) two chicken tacos, and one carne asada bowl.   The dining area is pretty big and they have seating outside as well. They yelled out our number and we went to pick up our food. Everything looked and smelled delicious!   The posole was pretty good! I added the toppings they provided and it was amazing. (Cilantro, cabbage, onion) The chicken tacos were so freakin good! The chicken was well seasoned and not at all dry. You do have the option of getting the tacos with everything on top or to just get your tacos plain. I got mine with everything on top. (Salsa, onion, cilantro)   My friend ordered the carne asada bowl and was surprised as too all the meat they had put in it. She did say though, she wishes they hadn't put so much pico de gallo and beans in it, and it needed more rice.   The inside was clean and the wall art is great to look at. The music was \"LIT\" and at times it got kinda hard to hear my friend.   Great food and they also have alcoholic drinks!",

I came here with some local customers of mine who chose it as a great lunch spot. It's not expensive, so it's a good sign that a place is great when someone picks it even though they aren't buying. It's the kind of place you want to just share with people.  You can get 3 tacos with rice and beans for a little over 7 bucks. If your feeling like a glutton, you can get additional tacos for $1.75. I couldn't narrow it down past 4, so I went with gluttony. Don't judge me.  Heres the final verdict: Carnitas and Al Pastor were both fantastic. Not greasy, full of flavor and cooked beautifully. If I lived here, it might be hard to keep me from camping in front of this place. The carne asada was very good as well. The Pollo was good, but a little flat compared to the others. Its probably way better than I give it credit for, but its hard when you are a farm team star playing on a big league field. I do have to say, the guacamole side was also a little plain. I would expect more from a place where the tacos pack in so much flavor.  Service was super friendly. It's an order at the counter place, and inside is casual, comfortable and clean.   A real winner. Now, go eat some tacos.",

The food is tasty, they also have a variety of alcoholic beverages you could choose from. I wish they had super spicy salsa. But most places don't. I've had the tacos, which I love that they're small and not full of sour cream and cheese. They're are almost like street tacos which I love!  I've also had the ceviche which I must say is better than some of the seafood places I've tried out here.  I also like that they have different salsas to be used in the front. The wait is pretty long. I usually go for my lunch and I spent most of it waiting for my order.  The staff there is extremely friendly and the artwork is awesome.

Not too sweet,  not too sour, it was perfect. Chilaquiles was so good. Everything tastes like Nana made it.  Horchata came out of a big agua fresca container dished out with a ladle like it should be. Place is legit. $1 taco tues! Clean and super cute dia de los muertos style decor. Love this place! This will be our new fave for sure.",

    "text": "I was very excited when this place opened because many fellow Yelpers stated that their food was so good at the other locations.  In fact, a few Yelpers were so excited that they posted positive reviews of this place before the restaurant opened- not cool!  This review is based on the three times I have been there.  The first time I went I ordered the pastor taco, shrimp taco and a chicken enchilada.  While the tacos were flavorful and not too spicy, the chicken enchilada was kind of a mess.  The entire enchilada needed to be cooked more.  On the second occasion, I had the Super Nachos.  There was nothing super about the Super Nachos except I had a super stomachache after I ate them.  I returned today and decided to go with the tacos again.  As today was Taco Tuesday, Los Taquitos was offering chicken, carnitas and el pastor tacos for just $1.00 a taco.  The chicken taco I ordered was very tasty but the two other tacos were actually kind of nasty.  Today the el pastor taco was incredibly spicy while the other day it was mild..  Consistency is important and hopefully Los Taquitos will figure it out.  It also would be nice if they had more salsas available or some sort of salsa bar to liven the tacos up.",

The grilled fish has good flavor, but was slightly too dry in my opinion. I had to add extra salsa. The al pastor on the other hand was delicious: well-marinated and perfectly cooked. On one occasion, my rice was undercooked. The portions are smaller than most divey, Mexican fast food restaurants. Overall, Los Taquitos is a good choice: not amazing, not bad.",

Wasn't crazy about the dressing they used for the burrito.  Rice was nothing special, especially since I found a piece of paper in it.  Retried beans were good.

We both ordered chicken burritos and I added enchilada style.  Unfortunately the chicken was extremely dry and very very salty.  My burrito did not come with salsa or beans inside like the menu states.  My husband ordered his Arizona style with the pico on the side.  Again just a bunch of dry chicken with potato's and no pico.  The order took particularly long too and our cashier had a massive hickey on the right side of her neck with bite marks that she didn't even attempt to cover up.  Classy!   I'll be back for taco Tuesday again, but that's about it.",

I go at least 4x a month for over 2 years to Los Taquitos on Elliot & have never had an issue with my food or the staff. Today, I decided to try the one on Ray Rd, since it was closer to my meeting. Wrong decision. Upon order, the lady at the front was rude she legit stares at you without saying one word - she expects you to read her mind. This resulted in having a problem with my food.. I had nothing put purple stuff all over my tacos (cabbage). It was as if I ordered cabbage with a little bit of taco. When bringing it to the front I stood in line for about 5-10 minutes before being helped, listening to the same lady who \"helped me\" \"helping another person\" - all she kept doing was repeating everything in the burrito bowl to the customer, when the customers question was \"is it all grilled together in the bowl\", repeating what's in it won't answer if it's grilled together, but again the lady behind the counter expects you to read her mind. I was informed that they do not put lettuce and pico on the street tacos anymore... like street tacos w/o lettuce & pico. When advising another lady she said, they haven't updated the signs but it's been like this for months. Since when? What? When I advised her I never had this issue at the one on Elliot, her demeanor changed quickly trying to be nice. The staff was very unprofessional & not helpful at all. Also included is a picture of my shrimp... tell me you'd wanna eat this & maybe I'll change my views on this location. When I decide to go back, I'll be sticking to the nice ppl on Elliot. I think maybe Guy needs to come back and evaluate his rating on this location.",

We ordered 2 asada, 2 carnitas, 1 pastor, 1 fish, all street tacos. With drinks, 1 rice n beans, flan, it came to $22.Flavor was average; the sauce tasted the same for all the tacos. The carnitas had a lime flavor instead of the asada which threw me off as I'm used to having lime only with asada tacos. The meat were all soft n juicy. The flan was bland and the texture led me to believe it didn't have enough egg yolks - but it was obviously healthier for you. The asada is worth another try but that's it.",

The first time I asked for no beans, but when I got home I learned there were beans. Today I asked for no beans, add guac. Well the no beans happened but no guac either. These are small things but it's not hard to get right- so I hope they will work on attention to detail.   2.  Guacamole quality. I was very surprised to see such poor quality guac. It had a pudding like consistency and zero flavor. It is such a departure since all the food is flavorful and very good quality. I understand avocados are expensive but you can't serve green applesauce and call it guac. If it's that difficult or expensive I would remove it from the menu.",

Im origionally from Cali so ive had some great mexican food and also experience some bad. Ive been to a couple mexican restaurants out here and have not been impressed at all. I decided to cash in my GC and tried their carne asada burrito.  Wow, I thought it was delicious, the meat was tender and juicy and had an equal balance of meat/rice/beans. They look small but believe me, they are extremely filling. I also tried their carnitas and they were delicious as well. I honestly didnt think this place was going to be this good but, i was wrong. I wish they had more options of aguas frescas though. Their salsas are also pretty good. Wish they had a lil better set up of the salsa bar with extra things u can take to go. Overall, great place and will definately come back.",

The tacos were underwhelming.  The chicken was not tender (perhaps overcooked or sat after cooking).  The carnitas missed the mark as well...the meat was too fatty for my taste.  No complaints about the asada however.    The rice and beans would have been excellent had they been served hot and steamy, instead they were just slightly above luke warm.  To be fair, it was just a soft opening and I'm sure they will improve.  I will be back and will adjust my review after the next visit if I have a better experience.",
