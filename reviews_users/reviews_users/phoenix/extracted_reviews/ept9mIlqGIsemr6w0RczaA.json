Everything I have had is awesome, and really really really big portions (fruit & cheese fantasia, nachos, chicken combo platter, wood-fired chicken, gyros, wraps, spinach pasta salad...YUM!) You can definitely share an entree with somebody else, or split a couple of apps. Or just order it all and feast :)  They almost lost me for a bit. I would come here right around either a shift-change, or just a slower time in the day (2 or 3 pm) and our servers would be MIA. Getting this or that took forever. The first time I thought I was crazy, then it happened multiple times, and a couple more after that. Solved part of that problem myself by just grabbing the check early if I know I have to get outta there. Not a big deal, but a little frustrating.  Came last Monday for dinner. I believe Phil was our server's name. He was the best! Polite, knew his favorites and preferences, refills, and very attentive.",

I've never ordered a bad meal here and staff have always been cheery. The reason for the bump in the rating? The tapas special during the happy hour. You can order small portion plates from $1 to $2. You can get Mozzarella & Tomato plates to Hummus and tiny slices of Pizzas. Seriously, It's cheaper than chips!  What's not to love?    .",

As for the food and any menu recommendations, I like the:  Red Pepper Hummus   Gambas Con Ajo (5 shrimp, loads of garlic and tomato. Hint: the description says there's cilantro. I HATE cilantro and I like this dish.)   Spicy Chicken Wrap (packed with chicken, beans and rice -- big enough to share!)   Broiled Fish Sandwich (My fish was cooked perfectly here. There was way too much bread, though. I wound up eating most of the fish with a fork and leaving most of the bread)   Fruit & Cheese Fantasia (A hit with my family. It's huge!)   Wine List (they have great selections! I can always find something I like.)   Perhaps my least favorite thing on the menu: One Thousand Beans because it has tempted me more than once and then proved to be beyond bland -- flavorless. Blech!",

I had a few tapas which were great appetizers for less than $5, but I was not prepared for the awesomeness of the Veggie Garden wrap.   Firstly, it was HUGE! And the quality of the food was so high that I couldnt finish it! A wonderful blend of veggies that is way beyond your iceberg lettuce/ tomato/ onion joke of a wrap that most places serve. A Savory sauce holds it all together from the inside, while a great tortilla hugs it together externally.   The service was great.   The art was great.  The atmosphere was hip, artistic, and classy",

Upon moving to downtown Phoenix a year and a half ago, we've frequented the 3rd Ave location about 10 times.. all of which we have been disappointed. (Yes, we think it'll just be better the next time...) The service is never great - whether we call in an order or eat at the restaurant. The food is usually good... although on occasion it has been wrong. We're not ones to complain, coming from the service industry ourselves, but I just wish this place would get its act together as we do love the food.",

The portions here are generous sized but prepared healthy so you can indulge without feeling guilty.  I'm not a big fan of hummus or even the pita dishes so I go either for their fish or their wood fired chicken. The wood fired chicken in particular is served with delicious, zesty garlic tomato sauce that almost make your toes curl. Accompanied with mashed potatoes, this is probably my favorite dish.  Unfortunately I've only ever had Pita Jungle as takeway so I've never had the eat-in experience but I bet the food is even better dinning in.....some day.",

Sadly, no, no, it did not.  There might have been 5 actual mushrooms in the dish. It was served on what I can only perceive as a sauce plate.

When I'm in the mood for something light their salads never disappoint. When I wanted to load up before my marathon it was the chicken combo platter for me! I stand my ground when I say that nothing on this menu isn't delicious.   When I moved to downtown I was ecstatic that a Pita Jungle was right down the street. It is conveniently located, with a parking garage for its customers. The reason for only 4 stars is because I have sat on the patio several times (taking advantage of the beautiful fall weather) and every time the service has been less than desirable. Inside, there are no problems but for some reason it's always slow when seated outside. Which is unfortunate because it's such a nice patio! Even so, it doesn't stop me from visiting this location after work for some Tapas, or on the weekends for a lovely brunch!  Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!",

As a vegetarian, it's extremely difficult to find restaurants catered to our food preferences. About a month ago I ordered the macro platter and Greek salad for pickup. When I came home the salad looked disgusting. There was a massive red onion with onion skin on it and a brown lettuce stem the size of 6-8.\" Basically, the salad looked liked the pantry chef/garde manger chef threw it together in a dark closet. I called the restaurant immediately and spoke with the manager, he informed me he would credit my bill in full. I still haven't received the credit and have called since the incident and was informed I would receive the credit and it was just delayed because of the holidays. Still waiting. Tonight, with great hesitation I ordered dinner. I ordered a falafel pita, sauteed broccoli, potatoes, side of tahini, side of pickles and a side of Tzatziki. My bf picked up the food tonight and upon receiving the order I noticed I didn't receive the side of pickels or Tzatziki. The red onions in the falafel pita were absolutely HUGE as well as the MASSIVE broccoli pieces and potatoes. This restaurant continues to go downhill. Their kitchen staff doesn't care about the food or presentation and it shows. I gladly welcome a new vegetarian restaurant to come into the area to take over this poorly managed restaurant.",

The prices are in line with what they should be, but this is nothing to write home about.  I'm glad that down town is getting more places to eat, but if the prevailing attitude is going to be sort of blah, then I think I'll drive to eat.",

I always walked passed this place to snag coffee and hi-jack a table to study at lolas. However as I was exiting & noticed a crowd of folks eating outside. My hunger pains got the best of me, so I decided to give it a shot and the hostess, blonde wow. Getting off point, the food was excellent their menu had a nice variety of options. Great service and the atmosphere was inviting. A kick-ass place to bring friends and chow down!",

The food is different lots of dishes you can order other places but they seem to have there own special twist on things.

I never went to a sit down Pita Jungle, so the slow service seemed liked an eternity. I will attribute that to the new staff getting the hang of things.  I'm vegan so I was very happy that they gave a list of what was and wasn't safe to eat, and WHY! That was the best part; you could change the meal to be vegan/vegetarian.   Went today again and liked it even more than the first time.  A good drink ran Rada about 5 bucks, and The hummus sample plate was a buck and additional pita was not even 50 cents more. Amazing.  I like hummus.  You can get veggies with it instead of pita if that's not your thing.  If you're looking for beef and pork though...keep going. The only beef you'll see is in the Gyros. Burgers are veg. :D I am very happy to have this place just walking distance from my fab flat!! Thanks for finally opening!!!!!",

    "text": "This is the fourth pita jungle location I've been to, and I must say this location beats out the Chandler location in terms of character, and overall atmosphere. Now, the Chandler Pita Jungle may have a \"lake\" view but this one is set in the middle of the very artsy and picturesque Roosevelt neighborhood. Its setting alone yells out sophisticated urban space. The large windows facing the street, the whole exposed air ducts/loft look and the large mirror with the kitschy frame made of various radios and stuff - love it! now, as for the food, what can I say? I love pita jungle for what their menu offers, and I am boring when it comes to Pita Jungle coz my usuals are hummus, their garlic potatoes (yum!), the Chicken Shwarma plate, and my ultimate fave their Chicken Pasta Salad (rotini pasta, with grilled chicken and sliced tomatoes) boring eh? So, I decided to change it up, and this time I got the Chicken del Sol, it's more of a stew of sorts with chicken pieces and stewed tomatoes and a cheddar lavosh crisp as an accompaniment. It was good, loved the taste and flavor but I really felt they went overkill with the tomatoes, it  was a tomato filled dish that really became too much that i started hating what i ordered. =( Chances of me getting it again is a possibility, maybe I'll ask for less tomatoes, but me coming back to this location? of course! love the vibe and can't wait for another pita jungle outing. =)",

    "text": "Its not often I give such high marks to a chain.  Or more specifically a location within a chain.  Pita Jungles are everywhere in AZ and the growth of the franchise shows no signs of slowing down.  The experiences you have at Pita Jungle can vary by location and the staff they employ.  These different locations can often have their own atmosphere unique to the neighborhood they're situated in.  In fact if I were writing this review about Pita Jungle in, say, Arrowhead (which I've gone to multiple times) I probably wouldn't be giving such high marks.  But the Downtown Phoenix location is different.  I've read the reviews both good and bad about this location.  And as much as I've looked attentively for areas which I could criticize since going here, this location has never let me down and its time to give them credit for it.  I've actually used this location far more for takeout than dining in.  They have great party platters that have wowed my friends and family for years.  Today though I dined in for the 3rd time at this location.  The location itself is fantastic.  In an old restored historic building thats been around almost a century.  Its nestled wonderfully on the corner of 3rd Ave and Roosevelt right along the arts district.  The interior is modern, but you get great views of the neighborhood from inside and there's a patio out back with plenty of extra seating.  Definitely feels like a neighborhood haunt.  The service I've received each time here has been exemplary and today was no different for lunch.  My staples are the hot pitas.  My favorite being the shawarma.  The one I had today was just as good as its ever been.  Clean, flavorful, fresh ingredients, and at a reasonable price.  I didn't know this but they also apparently have a Sunday Brunch menu which my Dad jumped on.  He had the pancakes with blueberry sauce and was highly satisfied.  All totaled (including drinks) lunch only set us back $20 with tip.  I've had a number of other dishes here as well including the hummus, the tazziki, their caprese salad, and even their wraps.  Every dish has exuded quality and flavor.  It's really no wonder Pita Jungle continues to grow.  They've got a menu that appeals to a wide variety of tastes and diets.  From my experience, I haven't had a bad item here ever.  I'm pretty certain any Pita Jungle will deliver on most of these qualities.  But in terms of aesthetics, vibe, and service, Downtown Phoenix may be Pita Jungle's preeminent location.",

We finally are told from across the room to sit where we would like. The waitress annoying came to take our order and breezed off. We ate our food and was never checked on after that. No refills for our drinks, nothing. The chicken in my salad was undercooked. You could see it was still slightly pink.  I have also ordered over the phone and the service is equally as sloppy. They often sound hassled by the call even though it's usually at night as opposed to the lunch rush. Once again the chicken comes undercooked. I order it because when it's done correctly it is appetizing. Alas, more often they can't get right. Occasionally I'll order the fish and spinach. When it gets to me it's fish and spinach soaked In oil. Very sad. Just not up to par with other pita jungles.",

Because the menu looked so awesome I was looking forward to making it a regular place to come grub, however I am heart broken to report that we received moldy pita bread with hummus (photo attached) followed by defensive service... I would have been willing to add a star to this review but only one out of three employees was actually apologetic about the situation. One bearded man in an apron actually tried to insinuate that I couldn't tell the difference between mold spots and oven char, and then a waiter with a quirky mustache was a bit over dramatic in offering either a new piece of PITA (untoasted) as if somehow it would prove that mold didn't exist on the first piece. Look guys- mistakes happen and restaurants are hard to run, (I know first-hand about this as I have helped run one!) but the number one rule after inspecting food and cleanliness is to try not to insult the intelligence of your customer. The hummus, chicken schwarma and falafel were mediocre at best, and again,  I'm just sad, but it happened... I also recommend you guys clean your decor better because dust hanging over head is just as unappetizing as much as moldy bread. Thank you to the waiter who reminded me of Neal Patrick Harris for seeming genuine in his apology and stating \"omg, that's disgusting and completely unacceptable\" because it was. Double check your food folks. Adios!",

Erica was our server and she was very attentive even with how busy she was because she had patio seating too, and the patio was crowded because of the great weather. Erica took great care of us, even offering suggestions to me for food when I couldn't decide.  Heard her offering  others recommendations as well.  Very friendly service!  I ended ordering the Kafta pizza which was very tasty.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone.  Great food, vibe, and service!",

Top favorites would be the hummus (get the trio where they let you try all 3 for the same price or some combination thereof) and the chicken chipotle lavosh pizza (it's amazing). The lentil soup is pretty tasty as well.   The other perk is that service is generally fast, the staff is friendly, and the portions are a good size. The food is as good there as it is to-go which I've done a few times.",

    "text": "After waiting for seemingly FOREVER for this location to open, it took me a few weeks to get to actually eat at the downtown Pita Jungle.  It was initially a little confusing.  We rode our bikes from my place downtown, and locked them to a tree on 3rd Ave. side.  Not sure if there are bike racks on the patio side, which seems to be the main entrance.  There must be a parking lot back there, as all things Phoenix seem to revolve around the car.  We entered from the Roosevelt side, and a sign pointed us to a host station across the dining room.  We went in and out a couple of times (bike lights, water bottles, etc.), which seemed to attract a hostess to our side of the building.  We were seated where we could keep an eye on our bikes, which we appreciated.  Our server was upon us before my friend was even seated, offering drinks.  I hadn't even been able to scan the beer/wine menu, so she brought me a water in the meantime.   I was not impressed with the beer selection at all.  It was pretty limited.  I got the salmon dinner, which included wilted spinach and garlic smashed potatoes.  These are three of my favorite things.  They arrived quickly, and were hot.  I was less than pleased that my spinach was served heaped upon my potatoes and topped with the salmon.  I was ok with the spinach and salmon touching, but didn't really dig the spinach juices soaking into my potatoes.  But maybe that's just me.  My friend ordered the spanikopita and said it was ok.  She also got the pita melt, and said that was good.  A couple of other friends who also live downtown rode their bikes up shortly after our entrees arrived.  They got the hummus, and had to request extra pitas, as the two it included were simply not adequate.  He got the falafel.  She got the chicken lavosh.  The turtle cheesecake was delicious.  My friend enjoyed the rice pudding, which is made in-house.  I really dug what the Pita Jungle has done with the physical space.  It's huge and open.  There's a ginormous patio, too.  Not sure about the heating/cooling options outside, as we ate in the dining room area (as opposed to the bar area or the patio).  I LOVE the location.  It's a nice bike ride from my house.  It has a very chill, urban feel.  I hope downtown folks support this latest Pita Jungle venture.",

I skipped the pitas that came with the hummus and instead brought out my own veggies, all of which went great with the dip. I want the recipe!!   The restaurant itself is such a pleasant place to be, too. The inside is huge with high ceilings and lots of windows, and the patio is always hoppin'.

I usually order the lentil fatoosh salad, but today I decided to order the wood fired salmon, and boy was that a mistake. First of all, my food took forever to come, I waited 40 minutes. Once my food arrived, my salmon was not well done as requested, and the portion size was super small considering the price of $15.99. It was literally maybe 2 big tablespoons of mashed potatoes and a sprinkle of spinach. The food was Uber bland, and it wasn't made with love. Whoever is cooking in the kitchen must really hate their job because it shows in the food.  The server \"tried\" to fix the situation by bringing us a complementary desert and she brought us baklava after I cleared mentioned a gluten sensitivity at the beginning of our order. What in the world?!! She was kind enough to give us $10 off the next meal. I am so disappointed and I won't be back. Ever.",

I am not sure I can put my finger yet on what Pita Jungle is, but I enjoyed my experience and would be open to repeating.  My friends and I split the jalapeno and cilantro hummus and it was quite splendid.  I was a bit confused why it only came with two pitas when it was clear that two pitas would not be sufficient.  Luckily, each additional pita was only 39 cents.  Still, don't serve a dish that is not complete without paying extra.  My friends all had various other dishes that were huge portion-wise.  They all enjoyed their selections.  Service was decent.",

It was a glorious day when we (my lovely co-workers at Arizona Theatre Company) heard the news that Pita Jungle was open for business. Of course, the best part is that we can walk there from our office on 5th Ave and Roosevelt. Also fabulous is the food! Delicious food!  I've been for lunch a few times now, and I want to do a happy hour there soon. I keep eyeing the bar area ....   My favorite thing to do at Pita is split two specific items with a friend.   1. Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus (the small platter is plenty!): Chickpea puree with cilantro, jalapeno and tahini sauce, seasoned with fresh garlic and lemon juice and topped with pico de gallo.   and  2.  The Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza: crispy wood-fired Lavosh crust topped with honey mustard glazed chicken, wood-fired onions, cheddar, feta, mozarella and herbs.  I don't even like hummus THAT much, but I really love THIS hummus.   The only thing I have had (so far) that I wasn't crazy about was the Taboule salad, but maybe I'm just not a Taboule kind of gal?  Overall, pretty delicious. I've noticed that they're still working out some issues. There have been a few customer service inconsistencies, but I'm still in the \"grateful they're open\" stage.",

I figured, a new location for me will do. Today was my third time visiting with my girlfriends and I ordered my usual, a falafel wrap. Three bites into it, it was good, as usual. Before I can continue eating, I removed the foil wrap and there was piece of chicken on the side of my pita bread. I totally lost my appetite since I haven't had meat in 10+ years. I made the waitress aware and she offered to bring out another one. I had already lost my appetite so I did not want it. She brought out the bill to me and said that the manager wouldn't charge me for my meal, well, I hope not since I didn't get to eat it. I was paying for my friends because we were celebrating a birthday so when I paid I informed the waitress that there should be a bigger discount because it's not just about me loosing my appetite it's about the fact that I sat there while my friends ate and at one point they didn't feel comfortable either and felt bad. She informed me she would ask her manager. She came back, dropped off my copy of the receipt, and walked away. Not saying anything at all. I opened the bill and the manager didn't take any additional discount or anything. What a shame. This is the second bad experience and after this I DEFINITELY won't be giving Pita Jungle a THIRD try!",

Since the weather is so nice out, we were able to take advantage of patio dining. Our server was nice, but honestly, I don't remember her name. In fact, I'm not sure she introduced herself, but one of my friends knew her from a previous restaurant they both worked at.  We enjoyed the falafel platter and the small hummus as starters. The falafel was flavorful, tender, and not overdone at all. I hate hockey puck falafel. My vegetarian friend enjoyed the roasted vegetable salad, my son had the pesto pizza, our other friends had the lavosh pizza, and I had the chicken schwarma pita. All were very tasty. My son enjoyed his pizza so much that he didn't even speak the entire meal.   I'm looking forward to coming back soon to try out some other treats!

I liked the fact that it wasn't too loud to have a nice conversation during happy hour.  We ordered drinks and got the Hummus Trio, Babbaganoush, and some pita.  The first batch of pita was cold but nice and soft.  We quickly ate it up dipping it in the hummus and Babba.  The different types of hummus were very flavorful.  The happy hour prices on the appetizers were great but our server told us the servings were only enough for one person (so not really for sharing).  We asked for more pita and then got a few whole pitas which were warm.  When they cooled, however, they got hard...not very appetizing.    Servers were friendly and checked in with us often enough.   It wasn't too crowded when we were there (between 4 and 6 on Friday) but busy enough.  We didn't have too many other things to eat but the menu looked interesting--I definitely would like to come back.    One tip: there is a parking garage with free parking across the alley from this place.  It doesn't have a lot of spaces but probably is best for late afternoon to early evening.",

I have a serious baklava addiction. This baklava.... it was weird. The pastry itself had very little honey in the nut mixture. So it was super dry. Instead of a drizzle of honey over the top, it appeared they poured a bunch of corn syrup instead.      Our service was decent. The restaurant was clean, but it just felt as though it was trying too hard to be trendy.    Will I go back? I don't know. I can get better Greek food at some of the hole in the wall places I've tried.",

    "text": "That damn no 1/2 star system strikes again. If it were in place, I'd give our experience this location a solid 2.5 stars.   On the drive there, we contemplated Crazy Jim's but decided to give this location a whirl in hopes of it outshining it's sister spots.   For starters, this is the cleanest version of any location I've visited (Chandler, Tempe, Arcadia). I agree that the interior decor doesn't really match the vibe but it's nice and the patio has plenty of room with proper seating.   Down to business: The service was the BEST we've ever experienced at any location. Our server was sweet, attentive and helpful; just the right blend. She deserves 5 stars; and that's so rare for Downtown service.   The food: salty, messy, blah creations we could've whipped up better versions of at home.   Roasted Red Pepper Hummus and Pita: It had been over a year since my last PJ visit and since then I've become quite the regular at Crazy Jim's. I literally spit out the hummus and pita in the most ladylike fashion imaginable; I couldn't even eat it. Once you get used to real, homemade pita, this store-bought version won't cut it. The hummus was over blended, bland and salty. Crazy Jim's is flavorful, chunky and fresh. I was instantly sad we placed our whole order at once, otherwise we would've cashed out and headed straight there.   Dolmades: the flavor was sort of there (it helped \"soak up\" the salty hummus left in my mouth), it was missing something but I couldn't quite pin it and they were pretty messy. I'm used to them all being tight, perfect cigar rolls, even fresh-made same day.   Salmon entree with garlic mashed potatoes and wilted spinach: My first version was a salt bomb. I ate about 3 bites and super nice server got me a new one. It took about 15 min (rightfully so) and the new one looked NOTHING like the old one and tasted like actual salmon, spinach and potatoes. Plenty of food for leftovers. Again, nothing spectacular but good enough.   (Husband) Turkey pesto lavosh wrap: Meh. I was underwhelmed and kind of annoyed he ordered something we could've made at home; only our version would have had better quality deli turkey. Theirs uses that \"slimy\" deli turkey...not a fan and barely a pesto flavor.   Overall, for $45 for 2, the experience simply wasn't worth it. I enjoyed the patio and could see returning for a beer or glass of wine but certainly not the food. There's just not enough attention to the ingredients or consistency. Next time I want cafe style Greek/Mediterranean, I'm heading to Crazy Jim's.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the whole Pita Jungle family, so I was pretty pleased with the newest addition. Working at the Downtown campus of ASU, there are certainly some great spots (especially when the food trucks hit on Friday), but having some pita goodness less than 5 minutes away is nice. I actually missed the grand opening by....well, about 5 months, but better late than never!  So first, this place is basically a \"spic-and-span'd \" version of the Tempe and Indian School PJ's. For Desert Ridge and Downtown, the Jungle seems to have cleaned up their act a bit, with the ambiance and serving staff. Not that I dislike the punk chics with sleeve tattoos at the other locations (cute inked girls are never a bad thing), but you can see that the Roosevelt location is trying to draw in the business crowd. It must be pretty successful; we got there at 11:15 with the place half empty, and it was packed within 15 minutes.  Our server was very good, on top of our table (in a good way) during the entire lunch. I am pretty easy at Pita Jungle; I am legally addicted to their hummus, so I just got the Hummus with Sirloin while my lunch-mate ordered a greek salad and dolma. Everything was fantastic. I have never had a bad order of hummus from PJ (and there have been A LOT of orders), and the sirloin was really good. I was used to the chicken, but the steak was a welcome change. I even grabbed a dolma from CM, which was very good, almost like a full sushi roll with just rice.  Overall, it was a very good lunch experience. I would suggest getting there early to avoid the lunch rush and dive into some pureed chickpea splendor.",

I have eaten here for years and should probably have more consistency in my check ins because I would be the BOSS!    For those who seek healthy catering options, these guys rock my staff have always appreciated it.  Their menu selection is very diverse and the hummus is off the hook.  I love having the mahi with hummus and pita chips!    You can always try out their lavoush pizza's and never forget their Pitas!   The staff are always cool hipsters that actually work really hard for their tips (at least in the two locations I frequent).    Only feedback for the owners of the company would be to be more consistent in your recipes across your expansions!",

The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like.  As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.  My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the \"meat\" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];  So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.   But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.   Yes, I'm bitter.",

    "text": "This was was my first time here. I was really excited to try this place out I have heard so many good things about it. Parking sucks... drove in circles then found a spot. The building itself lookes like it was closed but it was just the shades that made the windows look blackened.  I was seated immediately. The waitress was not much help when I asked a couple questions. So I just went and ordered what I was familiar with a gyro and side greek salad. I did order the cilantro hummus now that was very good. Tasty perfectly creamy and well seasoned. Glad that came out because I was starving. And it took forever to get my lunch. I kinda almost wanted to pay for my hummus and leave.  I couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to. I kept seeing plate  after plate brought out to my neighbors. I wish my server offered me some of the other things that I was seeing. But oh well. When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there. It was actually good. Now I have had gyros at a few places and I just kept thinking is this pita from frozen?  I have seen pita bread that has been frozen and thawed before and it looked exactly like this.  When I have had pita at other places it looks like the Greek dude in the back hand made that sucker. Just wondering.  Oh and another thing is if you are serving hummus please provide enough thawed out pita. I do have to admit the hummus was delicious. My gyro was huge and filling and the price was not bad for it. But this is just another joint for people to say OMG Hey lets hang at the pita jungle and be cool. I think its a nice place to come for a business meeting or meeting of something. And lighting does suck in there.",

The \"fresh\" ingredients in their salads have been prepared days before it ever gets sold- the onions are translucent and soggy, the lettuce is brown and cracking- if not wet and rotting- The dressings are even older. Take a point, if you are going to make a dressing ahead of time, don't put the lemon juice in till the last minute. The dressing is borderline rancid. Gross. The service is terrible every time.

Popping in for a quick take out order, I was really pleased to see the spacious interior with contemporary yet cozy tables and chairs. This seems like a departure from the other PJ locations, and it really fits the venue. Polished concrete floors and a historic building make a great canvas for this PJ location. It has a noticeably different feel than the Tempe location, and that isn't a bad thing. Bonus points to PJ downtown for providing ample space between tables. If you've been to the Arcadia location then you know how tight seating is, and you essentially need to introduce yourself to the people sitting next to you, as you will be hearing every word of their conversation.  As with other PJ locations, this location is filled with attractive servers, bustling around. When I went to pick up my order, I noticed a few employees were having a bit of a spat, and launching zingers back and forth at each other. Not sure what the issue was, but maybe a better location to fight would be in the back kitchen area?  In closing, this PJ location is off to a great start, as with any new venture, there are things to be worked out. I imagine if they get some front of house leadership in place, things will run more smoothly. In the meantime, it is a reliable place to grab a good meal.",

Hummus, olives, mozz & tomato, garlic potatoes - yum!  That way, you get so much variety.    I love how vegetarian friendly their menu is and I enjoy that I can try something new almost every time!  My favorite is the Thousand Bean pita - its so huge that even when splitting it with my man we are unable to finish it!  I wish their staff was more friendly.  On more than one occasion I've had staff be outright rude.  All other times, it never goes above mediocre.    Also, whats with the weird pita to hummus ratio?! From the name, you would expect an entire jungle of pita bread. There is always way more hummus and never enough pita...I am okay with eating my hummus with a spoon.

A friend told me they almost chocked on a piece of really hard plastic, I decided to go anyway (accidents happen) and it's literally one on my favorite places.  We ordered a Medeterenian salad and the broiled chicken salad. The server was okay, I think she was new. I always mixup the broil chicken and the wood fired chicken even tough they are totally diffrent. I didn't have the menue infront of me; she had a hard time explaining it. But it was ok until the first few bites of the medeterenian salad. We were trying to explain that something was wrong with the salad. My friend always orders the Medeterenian salad or Greek salad. I told her the dressing was rancid. My friend wasn't feeling well. Poor girl was so sick she almost vomited. The manager never came out. When the server came back she told me she couldn't find the manager. Unlucky lady I know who the manager is since this USED to be on of my favorite places. I told her you were standing right next to him right before you walked over?! Horrible service. This is not an awesome spot. I'm not sure why they lowered their standards.

Wow, has my opinion changed!  Service was great.  The ambiance was really comfortable.  The food was delicious.  What I appreciate most was our server's honesty.  I went in knowing I wanted baklava.  When I asked him if it was good, he said no.  I asked if he just didn't like baklava or if it was truly not good.  He said it was truly not good and recommended the carrot cake instead.  It may sound inconsequential to be so impressed about someone's opinion on dessert selection, but I thought it was really cool.  and the carrot cake?  TO. DIE. FOR.  Thank you, Anthony!  I went back yesterday with my cousin for lunch.  We arrived close to 12:30, at the height of the lunch rush.  We went in, gave our names, and waited just a few minutes for a table.  Again, service was great, even when we asked for extra pita, refills, or took forever to make up our minds.  This place  has quickly risen to the top of my favorites list!",

Some standards stay consistently good, but if you venture out to try something different, you're going to be disappointed!  I tried a salmon burger today and it had ZERO flavor. I don't know how that's possible. Even the red onion had no flavor. The potatoes served on the side were almost cold, and a bit soggy. Case in point: my photo.  Looks great, right?  Nope.",

I'd never heard of the chain until I moved out to Phoenix and had thought it was nothing more than something similar to a Pita Pit...Not the case!   While their menu did have some pita options, it offered many other diverse mediterranean dishes...everything ranging from Mahi Mahi to Chicken Masala, to pesto spinach salad dishes. Wow!  The group went with the hummus trio app (jalapeno cilantro, original, and red pepper) and the tzatziki sauce with fresh pita bread and pita chips - so fresh and flavorful, especially the jalapeno cilantro - a must try!   My spinach pasta dish was  delicious and filling (the portions are pretty big!).. pesto pasta abed spinach with a lemon vinaigrette.   While the service was a bit spotty (we had a group of 10 during the lunch rush), I will definitely be back!",

The chicken dish arrived about 15 minutes after ordering. It was a large portion of food with diced tomatoes on top and wilted spinach and garlic mashed potatoes beneath the chicken and was very good (4). It was a full meal and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.   Table service was good (3.5). Parking was available for no cost in the adjacent parking garage.",

My wife is vegetarian and all of the food we got had meat. I called the 3rd ave (this) location and spoke with a Spencer, whom proceeded to cut me off while I was speaking to tell me they would never send anyone to another location for anything. I totally understand mistakes happen and was more worried about the party that got our order expecting the massive order that we got in error. Spencer had no interest in our concern and I'm sorry to say that we may stay away from this location entirely going forward.

Loaded with vegetables (huge plus), packed with chicken and mixed beans (hello protein!) and lovely seasonings for just the write amount of punch! Best part- no cheese!!! (I don't like to intake dairy too often). We sat at the bar and got great customer service from the bartender. She was blonde and super friendly (forgetting her name- sorry!) They had outdoor seating and are walking distance from a lot of cool spots downtown. Paid under $15 for my meal including tip. And this pita was large enough to have lunch leftovers next day.

When we inquired about the status, our server said \"we're busy right now\" and left us to wait another 10-15 minutes while other customer that arrived later than our trio were paying their bills! Then we receive the food and everyone's dish was significantly subpar compared to other recent experiences eating at this location. There was one time we were asked if everything was ok- before we'd even had a chance to eat (why do they do that?) There went $17 on a crap salad with over-cooked, skin-filled salmon and an iced tea that wasn't refilled once. Thanks, guys. I'll stay up in central Phoenix for future work lunches.",

The last time we were there we discovered the seasonal menu that had been the seasonal menu for months had changed. We had been eating at Pita Jungle more frequently than we used to specifically for the avocado chicken tostada menu item on that seasonal menu. It was in our opinion the best dish they had and would notice a lot of people around us ordering it as well. Needless to say we were quite disappointed the last time we were there that it was no longer available. I understand that seasonal menus change hence \"seasonal\". However, I would love to see the avocado chicken tostada be added to the regular menu, because it seemed to be quite popular and could be an everyday menu item.

This location does not take reservations, but I have been with groups of 7 to 25 people, and they were reasonable and helped us find tables together.  Or, there's a large table towards the front where large groups can sit together.  I had a graduation party there, meetups, and birthday parties with excellent service. The wait staff doesn't hover and make us feel like we have to leave immediately after eating.   Food: Hummus is ok, soups are usually quite tasty. The happy hours specials are nice.  The veggie wrap is usually very good but have ordered a few that were bland.    Service: Usually quite efficient and helpful. Sometimes a table may have one server and multiple individuals coming by with food, but I have not had any issues.  They also don't make us feel like we need to leave ASAP if we are just chatting or hanging out.   Atmosphere: This location is surprisingly not busy as often as I thought it'd be.   There is an outdoors patio, nice in the spring and winter.  The inside has booths and tables, plus a bar area.",

I ate at the downtown PHX location, and I was completely surprised! Eat out on the patio if you can. It's a lovely setting with stringed lights overhead, and alley views. You get a real urban setting here, and delicious food. I had a pesto turkey pita and my husband had the Philly cheese steak one. We ordered the cilantro jalapeno hummus = this is a must try.

They have some great vegan options as well as just a large selection of healthy fresh menu items at a very reasonable price point. The only reason that I took off a star is that both times I have been here the parking is horrible. The plaza that it is in is awesome for bike up or walk up business, but if you are in a vehicle and it is anywhere from 11-1pm in the afternoon you may as well hang it up cause odds are it is not going to happen.    Back to the food, the hummus trio is seriously fantastic. I don't know of anywhere that I can think of off the top of my head that has better hummus. (I have been wrong before, so feel free to correct me :).  PS...Leave it to me to look over 30 super healthy and delicious menu items to find the one thing on a slab of bread and covered with melted cheese. (The chicken philly pita). There is a little something for every tastebud on their menu which makes for an easy choice if going with a group where no one can make up their minds.",

I choose to pick up the order as opposed to have it delivered. When I arrived to pick up the order there were a few things that went wrong. 1. due to the location it is difficult to pick up large orders unless you can pull up front to load the vehicle. Well there are pick up parking spots but patrons who are staying for lunch seem to feel that they can park there for as long as they want so these were all taken which meant i had to park in the far back part of a parking garage. No biggie except the restaurant does not have a cart to load the food on to take to the parking garage well.... they do but they only have one and that was in use for the guy doing deliveries. I had to make five trips back and forth to the garage with food. On the last trip I finally got one employee to help me out with a tray or it would have been six trips!.  Another issue is that the trays that the food is put on are flimsy even if you are very careful. I had thin plastic sandwich trays with a depth of an inch and a half over filled with humus. These would be trays you would serve sandwiches on. The covers kept popping off as they were transported and humus leaked out everywhere. Containers were not well sealed so I also had other food items all over the car. When I got the items out on the other end to take into the office it was very difficult as the containers were very leaky and messy.  I have done a lot of catering orders over the last eight years and this has been the worst as far as packaging, maintaining quality of food and keeping food in containers that keep food at temperature.  I was able to fix the presentation of the items but it was awkward.  I am happy to say that the other pita jungle locations do a better job of catering, I have to specify what containers I want used but other locations seem to be accommodating.  I will not be using this location in the future for catering orders. The container issue could be fixed but the assistance with the order which was large could have been handled better.",

    "text": "We have ordered food for our office from this location multiple times. Each time we have ordered from them something has been messed up. This last time was it. We had called at 10:30am to place an order for pick-up at 11:30am. Spent almost 10 minutes on the phone going over our order and confirming, only to get there and wait another 10-15min because our order was not correct. On top of having to wait for them to fix the order, which consisted of them literally just taking the protein off the salad and putting it into a box, they also didn't have our additional side of cucumber. After messing up on our order and making me wait another 10-15min they made me get back in line to pay $1.09 for the additional cucumber that THEY forgot to charge and put in. We called back and spoke with a manager and there was absolutely NO accountability for their mistakes. They clearly do not care about losing business from companies. Will never order here again or suggest them to anyone else. I suggest someone have a talk with this location because that is not how you run a restaurant.",

He had just been promoted from general help to handling take outs for this location.  He's going to do well.  The service he provided was just what I could have asked for. He knew the menu and a lot of small details I wouldn't have expected.   He even made me aware that there was covered parking that I didn't know about.  I haven't been in a Pita Jungle for years but if he is representative of the type of people that the company hires, I'll go back more often.  I certainly couldn't complain about the food either!  I like vegetarian especially when there are some interesting dishes featured which they definitely have.",

No refills, no silverware waitress dropped food on our table yet never came back to pick it up  and if we asked for the service that should have been provided she was plain rude about it. Worst dinning experience I have ever had. This location is plain awful!. Im not the type to write a bad review but the service was so horrible I felt this location really needs to do something about the servers they hire. I understand that a lot of circumstances can lead to bad service thats why Im usually not the type of person to complain I usually try to put myself in the servers shoes and understand that it might be a bad or busy day. I didn't go at a busy time it was this past Sunday around 4 and we sat at the patio. There weren't many people there yet the wait staff had no time to wait on our table or acknowledge us we constantly had to ask for service and still deal with them constantly forgetting to help us. Steer clear of this location. I have been to the other Pita Jungle locations and have had a great dinning experience. Beware!",

Having only been one other time I decided to order my usual, it's probably not \"usual\" if I only had it once, huh? Well, I decided to order what I had last time, how about that? Spicy chicken, beans, rice, a slew of veggies all wrapped up in some wheat pita, figured I'd enjoy it as much as I did last time, but not so much. It was a little off. Unlike last time when the veggies were crisp and I could differentiate between them, this was a pita full of mush, and I could barely get through half before I chucked it. It had good flavor and in PJs defense I took it to go, so maybe something is lost during carryout? In any case, It was good enough that I'll be back, and maybe next time I'll make sure to eat in.  Know Before You Go:  If you're taking it to go, call in your order. It was a zoo when I was there and I had to wait close to twenty minutes.",

Others had the philly chicken pita and the garlic potatoes which looked really good but for what I had and paid, totally not worth it. Service was good and friendly and it only took about 10 minutes to be seated inside however, we had an annoying fly lingering around our table the entire time.

So after pushing the chicken aside (I don't eat meat), I was left with an $11 sad looking pile of lettuce carrots.... I worked at a different Pita Jungle for years, so I get that mistakes happen during the lunch rush, but I wish someone had noticed the error before they tied up the bag.. guess I should take a peek inside before I leave next time.

The building and space are great, and certainly outshine the other strip mall locations around town. We started with Happy Hour Tapas and wine that are priced just right. The tapas portions are SMALL but they only cost $1.50 to $3.00 and a great way to taste a few diferent things. We both had the same entre of roasted chicken on spinach with smashed potatoes and tomato garlic broth. It was tasty although the Chicken lacked any kind of roasted qualities, it almost looked poached. none the less it's something I might order again. We had great service as expected from our server, she was very attentive.  Lots of good stuff above but now for the bad,  FLYS & BUGS! and LOTS OF THEM, not all the creatures buzzing around the table were standard flies, Im not sure what they were but the unwelcomed dining companions never left with a constant dive bombing and ear buzzing. Owners and managers cant ignor this and need to figure out how to get rid of them. For this reason alone, I probably wont rush back. The flies were the sole reason I didnt rate with 5 stars because they were that bad!",

The number one entree that I get pretty much every time I go to Pita Jungle is the Chipotle Chicken Lavosh Pizza.

Start with an iced tea, and make sure to get a to-go cup when you leave to really get your money's worth.   The hummus is creamy and seriously some of the best I have ever had. The trio allows you to sample all flavors while you pick a favorite. I usually need to order an extra pita to finish the hummus (can't waste something this good!).   For the main course, I love the lentil fetoosh salad, and it is very filling. The 1000 bean pita is also great, and also very filling. Whenever they have the lentil soup- get it. The roasted potatoes are a nice accompaniment albeit a little heavy if you're eating beans and lentils.   The dessert menu leaves something to be desired, but just explore downtown and you'll find other tempting options.   The lunch rush can get very busy, but just go a little early or a little late and you won't have an issue. Parking can be annoying because the garage is awkward but you shouldn't have a problem if you avoid the lunch rush. There is street parking available up and down the neighborhoods surrounding Pita Jungle.   Service can be hit or miss. Sometimes it rocks, other times it's slow and you feel like you are annoying the staff. I don't really care about the staff's moods, so I don't hold it against them.  Vegetarians and meat eaters - enjoy!!",

Normally I love pita jungle food is good and service is relatively good. It was a regular Friday date night for my fiance and I for years and still is. I rented out the back patio and because I was expecting of a party of 20 and or so and had ordered catering two weeks in advanced. I was already sad because a few family members got sick and couldn't make it to the rehearsal but looking forwarding to eating at our favorite restaurant and sharing it with our family who have never been there before. First of all they got the time I asked wrong. So they were not prepared once we arrived. I reserved the patio just incase. However no one was even in the Restaurant so that was clearly a waste of $50. Being unprepared my family and bridal party had to push the tables and chairs together so we can all sit together, then once the food was served it was served on plastic delivery plates like we were at a picnic or something.   I was very disappointed as the staff was not very attentive we only had one girl who can't clear plates all by herself there should have been another person helping her. No one checked if we would like water and the way things were served was very trashy. I honestly could have served a better small dinner at my house then pay all that money for what we got. It made me feel embarrassed on how everything was since my fiance and I raved about this place.    Also when my bother asked for more ice tea from the server because we ran out of the green tea she said \"no\" seriously? Something along the lines of that was all we got, or paid for.    I would not recommend catering or private parties there. It was not very special for a tiny rehearsal dinner.",

    "text": "I had to write a review here, because I couldn't disagree more with what someone else said in their review, \"You can expect Consistency and Good Service when you dine at Pita Jungle.\"  I live within a 5-minute walk of this location, and I've been there countless times so far in 2013.  Consistent is the last adjective that comes to mind when I think of this particular Pita Jungle.  So, I'm not sure it's possible to write an effective review of this place.  The service has ranged from annoyingly attentive to so neglectful you feel invisible when you're sitting at the bar 2 feet away from someone working there.  The kitchen can sometimes have your meal in 5 minutes, sometimes 50 minutes later you wonder if they even put in the order.  Sometimes it's extremely silent, sometimes the kitchen and staff are so loud you can get a headache even when there are only like 3 customers in the whole place.  The food is totally inconsistent also, and the garlic new potatoes come to mind as a good example.  I've had the garlic new potatoes as the side to a meal at least half a dozen times.  They have been absolutely mouthwatering perfection with perfectly cooked caramelized seasoning at times.  So perfect I was tempted to order two sides of the potatoes for desert.  However, once they were scorched on the outside and still a bit raw inside.  And the majority of the time they are generally just barely \"cooked\" (meaning not raw), but browned even slightly and totally bland and tasteless.  I could go on about a few other dishes, and about other service experiences.  But the point here is that this place is a gamble.  I only go now when I'm ready to risk it, or feeling lucky.  Occasionally it's amazing, sometimes it's completely disappointing and horrible, and a lot of the time it's just a mild let-down.  But consistent?   I don't know how many times the people who are writing those reviews have actually been to this location, but if they got consistency, they were really lucky.",

    "text": "This Pita Jungle was good. We went for the reverse happy hour. Well, what happened was we didn't know about the reverse happy hour until we got there. It starts at 9 and we got there at a little after 8. So we went for a walk around the neighborhood first to burn off some of those calories we were about to tack on and to kill some time. The walk was fun. The neighborhood is awesome. It doesn't feel like Phoenix at all. We even saw a big boat.  After the walk, we perused back over to the joint. I don't know if they had drink specials, we didn't drink that night. I had an iced tea and homemade lemonade. I think it's homemade. It tasted like it. I was impressed. I LOVE my Arnold Palmers. I would consider going there just for a big drink to go. I had the felafel, my husband had the chicken shwarma. The pita bread was a little hard and the felafel was a little dry. I don't know if maybe it was because it was the end of the night? We also had the hummus trio and the garlic dip. Both were delicious. But again, the pita bread was kind of dry. We couldn't decide which hummus we liked best. I think my vote is for the original. My husband was all over the tomato.  The service was pretty good, although she only came back to our table once. But again, that's probably because it was the end of the night, I think she was doing her side work. Luckily we didn't need anything. It was pretty busy for 9 oclock, I was surprised. We were no where near the last ones out of there. I don't know if we'll ever go back to Pita Jungle. I'd like another drink, but other than that, it didn't leave me craving more.",

I will paint this picture for you: Our server at the 2nd time we tried ....  beater tank top, disgusting armpits learning over our table.... yum yum.  NOT.   My first experience with this place was last June in Flagstaff, AZ.  There were 4 of us....  2 of us are from the restaurant industry so we get it.....We were sat, and we sat there for 15 minutes.  Not one person came by to get a beverage order or anything.  The group of servers where standing at the bar drinking their beverages and showing each other stuff on their phones...   We flagged one of them over, he literally rolled his eyes, and looked over at one of the other servers and pointed at us.  still nothing.... so we left.    so, I am back in Phoenix this week ....  I am a vegetarian... sounded like a good idea, same friend I am with, we decide to give them another try.   yea, pretty much the same thing....  we kept having to flag our server down, we had to ask for our appetizers as our lunches came out first ... and he gives us some bullcrap story about how pita bread takes forever to warm up.  uh ok.  whatever.  So, I am never going back, I tried twice.  At least the 2nd time I got to eat, the food was good.  But really I can't stand watching servers in restaurants drinking their beverages, watching the game and playing with their phones.....  Bummer.",

Went during the lunch rush, like only a crazy person such as myself would. Walked in and we were seated immediately. Our server came over promptly and took our orders. I kid you not, we were there for about 7-10 minutes and got our food within that time. I was flabbergasted!   I ordered the beef and lamb gyro. It was the largest, most succulent and flavorful gyro I've had to date. Get this....9 bucks! Well 9.48 with tax...CRAZY! The other person in my party had the hummus trio (cilantro/jalapeno, roasted red pepper, and original). The cilantro/jalapeno was my favorite. Not one flavor overpowered the other. I might even suggest the flavor of the jalapeno be a bit more present, but it was just phenomenal.   All in all, our dining experience lasted about 20-25 minutes. Talk about stellar and unheard of during the lunch rush? Bravo, Pita Jungle...Bravo!",

I had a flight leaving around traffic hour so didn't want to be far from the airport but I also don't like to eat anything heavy before a flight. My friend suggested this Pita place. So happy we did! The restaurant was very clean and we were greeted right away. There was beautiful art decorations all over with the option to purchase. They had a large menu and I really wanted to try everything. I didn't get a picture of it but we started with a trio of hummus. I believe the three were cilantro, roasted bell pepper, and regular. It was delicious! The pita bread they brought over was very fresh and warm. I was stuck between the Turkey Pesto Lavash Wrap and the Lavash Shawarma Wrap. I asked the waitress which one she recommended and she told me to do the Chicken with some of the sauces instead of turkey in the pesto wrap. IT WAS DELICIOUS! The prices were so fair and there was plenty left over. The waitress we had made sure the water was flowing and she was very attentive (I'm mad I didn't get her name). My only complaint, the parking. We struggled to find parking. Seemed like this shopping center was a little too busy that day. Other than that, I look forward to going back on my next visit!",

Found extensive happy hour menu and convenience of being 1 mile from Marriott. Amazing restaurant, not that the art was satisfying the hunger but nice atmosphere with local artistry. Menu had extensive list with prices ALL from $1.00 to $5.00 - was perfect to order tapas and sample dinner menu. Enjoyed everything we ate - entire bill for 4 people came to $50! No surprise the place was jam packed",

Those that read my reviews know how much I love my coffee and with Lola's right next door it was inevitable that I'd have to try this place out. When I walked in it took a bit to be seated because the host was running around. Great menu, and price wasn't too bad, but a little more pricey than I'd like to pay for lunch, but worth it for sure. I ordered a gyro and a side of rice. I was disappointed at first it didn't come with any type of other side, but when it came I'm so glad it didn't because this gyro was huge! I never would have been able to finish anymore food. Great taste and the rice was flavorful and perfect. Service was ok. It was kind of hard to get my water refilled, but again it was super busy and lunch time. Still a great experience.",

My favorite thing about PJ is their INCREDIBLE happy hour. They do a huge selection of tapas for $1-2 each! You can get a few small plates and try multiple things and have your bill, with drink, come out under $10. Slammin!   Tapas items: Hummus Trio, Garlic Dip, Sauteed Mushrooms, Tomato and Mozzarella, Olives, Taziki, Some Lemon Chicken Dish, Olive Oil and Pita, and Falaffel. I'm sure I missed a few others. They also do $1 of cocktails and beers, and have $5 draft margaritas. HH ends at 6pm.   Generally I think the food is pretty bland, but I have also come to love the cilantro jalapeno hummus, the 1000 bean entree, and the Caribbean salad. I also enjoy their falaffel.   I'm not really sure what would make PJ a 5-star for me other than all around improvement on the flavor of the food. Maybe I am just picky.",

    "text": "Easily the best experience I've had at Pita Jungle since they aggressively expanded. The space is open, inviting and tasteful, there are separate bar and dining rooms, and window seats make for a surprisingly romantic setting. I don't usually equate Pita Jungle with romance.   (Only layout criticism: The bathrooms are cozy, and not in a good way.)  The food was reliable as per usual (although the bread was a little stiff, which tends to be the case later in the day) but what set the Roosevelt location apart from PJs on 44th/Indian School and Scottsdale was the service. This girl had worked a long day (she recounted 15 and 20-top services she'd administered over the dinner rush) but her attitude was meadow fresh. (Sometimes I get a sense that PJ servers are allowed to be rough around the edges in an attempt to earn hipster cred but thankfully not here.)   I could eat the chicken and hummus plate with extra cucumber all day long and when I do I'll do it from this Roosevelt spot.",

This was my third visit to this location and the only qualm I have is in regard to the staff.  I went by myself to do some happy hour yesterday before going to a dbacks game.  I sat at an empty bar and received service that was just okay nothing to write home about.  What I am writing home about is how four employees stood directly in front of the tv I was watching and continued to conversate about ex boyfriends and how one of the servers dated someone seventeen years older than them.  Maybe it was because I was alone at the bar and there were no other patrons talking to drown them out, but still.  How bout I don't want to hear your personal conversation while having my beer and tapas.  My beer was good and cold, my sauteed mushrooms and hummus trio were good, pita bread was dry almost as if it were a day or two old.  I'll definitely be back as I am a pita jungle fan and I love their food, but the service leaves something to be desired.",

For being a chain restaurant (and after having been to some of the other locations around the city), this Pita Jungle really stepped it up when it comes to atmosphere. Great patio, cozy seating, and a laid-back bar.   #2: Excellent service! A group of friends and I sat at the bar today and had very impressive service. The bartender was quick, casual, and attentive...without that lurking feeling you can sometimes get. She was the perfect server.  #3: Badass happy hour. I love the $1 and $2 tapas! The hummus is so creamy and delicious and I love the oil and vinegar all over the mozzarella and tomato. Yum!  Good work PJ!",

Of course not knowing what to choose I went for a combination they offered with Baba Ghanoush, tzatziki, tabbouleh, hummus, marinated green bean salad, falaffel and a couple of dolmas. Yeah a lot of food is what I was expecting and I received.   The plate was served with about 3-4 whole pitas. They were a bit dry and stiff. Maybe Al Hana has me spoiled. The baba was a bit bland and I was unimpressed but I did really enjoy the falaffel, tzatziki, and the hummus. The green beans were good and I also prefer my tabbouleh with a better balanced parsley to Bulgar ratio. This was about 85%+ parsley.   I took about half of what I was served home. I can see myself coming back here but now I am wiser about what I would order or not order again. I did enjoy the ambiance and the location is hard to beat when I am out looking for quick bite to eat.",

Of course, they were delighted to see Hummus, Falafel, and Baba Ganoush on the menu! They were even more delighted when our food came out, and it tasted not only authentic, but was presented in a modern way and was completely yummy! I ordered the Hummus Trio platter, which was bespeckled with kalamata olives and lemon chicken. Yum! Others at our table ordered the wraps and the pizzas, all of which were excellent! We also got a Tomato-Basil Caprese Appetizer for the whole table to share, which we all enjoyed. Service is usually quick and friendly. The brick patio is very cute with string lights and a laid-back ambience.  They have great happy hour tapas platters, too! I love this place because it's healthy, reasonably priced, and gives you an authentic taste of the middle east.",

    "text": "A friend and I have been dying to try this place because everyone is always talking about how great the food is. So we decided to give it a try last night. When we walking in the decor was arty and cute, and it was actually pretty packed in there which was excited because that's normally a good sign on a Wednesday night.   There was a sign that said \"see hostess for seating\" with an arrow not really pointing to anything just into the large dining room. So we walked up to what looks like the hostess/cashier station and I asked \"Are you the hostess\" and the reply I received from a younger girl about my age was \"I guess I can be\". And this is where the TERRIBLE service had just begun.   We sat and waited for at least 10 minutes before a women can and asked what we wanted to drink. A man returned with them and told us he was our server. His name was David and was one of the most unpleasant servers I have encountered so far. He had the most put out attitude towards us, for example when he took our appetizer plate out of the way he took some silver wear with him, he said \"I'll bring some back.\" In a tone as if we were stupid to think he wasn't. When he brings new silver wear he TOSSED it onto the table and said \"Here\" And walked away. Every time he came to our table which wasn't not that often we would just cringe. When it came time to get the check he asked if we wanted it split we said yes, he walked away quickly not even asking how we wanted it split and came back and put the check onto the table stating \" I don't know how you want it split, figure it out and I'll do it.\". After that we just wanted to get out of there, we gave him $9 in cash to put towards the bill and the rest on the card and we clearly said to him to do it this way. He returns puts the check down and goes \"Well I put $7 in cash and kept the $2 and put the rest on the card, I thought that's what you said I could do\" as if he was scared we weren't going to tip him or something and he NEEDED to take that $2. I was shocked as a past server I would never bold face take money off the top like that. I told him no that was not correct and signed my receipt and gave him his REAL tip that was going to be on the card not his $2 in cash that he felt the need to keep. And we were out of there.   Now other than the service the food was fantastic. The hummus appetizer was amazing and we both had the gyros and they were amazing as well.  I will most likely not ever return to this Pita Jungle location because the service which is a shame because the food was really great.",

I have one drawback in that if you were to eat at the bar you may find it to be quite loud because the kitchen is open and it's right behind you.  We really enjoy the food and the setting.",

I like that it's a little bit fancy and the art work in the restaurant really suits the Downtown Phoenix style. This is a great place for lunch or dinner. I have yet to try brunch. This is also a good place for take out. I like to order and take a short bike ride then come home and pop in a movie. This is what makes living downtown fun.   My favorite dish is the chicken combo at any Pita Jungle. This is due to the delicious garlic sauce that I can mix with the rice. I also like the combo of beans, onions, and pickle. So good! No matter what you are eating, I recommend ordering some garlic sauce on the side. If you like garlic that is...",

It was so big and I think it had more toppings than lettuce!  Usually salads don't have enough topping.  There were so many different things in the salad and the curry flavor was different on a salad.  I don't think it would've worked without the grapes and raisins.  I might have to try something new again.  I liked this location.",

    "text": "I will start by saying that I normally LOVE Pita Jungle, so it disappoints me to only give this Downtown location 2 stars.  With 2 kids (under 3) in tow, I was meeting my best friend for a quick lunch downtown. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and keep my kids happy. It took almost 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge me - despite my telling the hostess after 10 minutes, and trying the flag down the server who kept going out of his way to ignore me. Finally I was able to flag down another waitress, and give her our full order, so that it would arrive by the time my friend got off work.  The lunch rush was over, so I didn't expect our food  to take longer than 15 minutes. We ordered a fruit salad (the Carribean), a Lavosh Chicken Schwarma Wrap, and a kids meal. THIRTY minutes had passed and our food was still not out. My friend literally had 10  minutes to eat before she had to be back in court.  The only thing they were quick about was taking my friend's credit card.  The 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual, but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch. So disappointed.  I really hope they step up their game. Next time I will go back to the Desert Ridge or Arrowhead location. Much better service/experience.",

I was excited to try them since they have branches all over the valley - in spite of some of the reviews here on Yelp.  While the service was good and the ambiance casual and attractive the food sucked. Total disappointment with their pita. Now, I wasn't expecting the rapture, but I was hoping that it would be one of the best ever. It was, actually, one of the worst. Cold, hard and tasteless. I have had wonderful, warn, fluffy and soft pitas here in the valley- but not here. You're the Pita Jungle. Hello ?  Very sad when you screw with a fat man's food.  While the portions were generous and well presented, all were just mediocre.  I had the Mediterranean Platter. I grade it a C. Now in all honesty, they have an extensive menu and maybe some of the other items are great. Hell, they look fabulous. Maybe so I should maybe give them another chance ? I want to like this place.  Again, the  service was good- and it was the lunch rush. Maybe the cook was in a bad mood. Sorry Mr. Pita Jungle.",

I also think the servers are more personable here, but that's totally subjective. Happy hour is great for drinks but I still prefer the full-sized food portions. I don't think you get the same amount of food during happy hour. I think the full-sized is a better deal.   When I ate meat, I loved the chicken Philly, but now that I'm vegetarian I prefer the fatoush salad. The portion is so large that I'm never able to finish. The salad is still great the next day cold or warmed up with a quick stir fry. I also always start with the potato garlic dip, it's just so delicious and simple, though I get it with cucumbers and tomatoes instead of pita. I once had the Caribbean salad when it was very hot out and it was an incredibly refreshing fruity salad. I shared it with another person and we still couldn't finish it.  This place is great for big groups, dates, and if you're flying solo you can sit at the bar and talk to their friendly bartenders or watch the tube. I like that Pita Jungle started in AZ, so I continue to support them.",

Given the great deal, we decided to do this for our Christmas Eve party this evening. We placed an order for four large hummus dishes and eight pita. When I presented the coupon at the restaurant, I was told that it was \"dine in only\". I didn't argue because my partner was the one who got the deal initially. I went back to look at the terms on the Facebook event, and sure enough it said \"present this event at time on phone at time of order\" so obviously it wasn't a dine in only event. Whatever the case, we are disappointed in the service and at the fact that the staff doesn't take care to understand the details of the promotions they place on social media.",

    "text": "I've been hooked on Pita Jungle for years, that's why I want to write about their decision to replace real Sriracha sauce with a house brand that either hasn't been taste tested or just plain tastes bad.  I'm a hot chili sauce fanatic, especially for Sriracha and Cholula. A few weeks ago our server at Pita Jungle delivered private label green and red hot sauces to our table. The name brand Sriracha was gone. The taste is awful - of both, but my main complaint is the red which I like to eat with baba ganoush.  Additionally, the bottle is some cheap, unsqeezable plastic that takes 2 hands to operate, so you can't exactly put some on a bite while you're eating. The taste is vinegary, without the wonderful nuanced blend of chilis in name brand Sriracha.  For hot sauce lovers, this is quite a negative and, in my opinion, a bad business decision on Pita Jungle's part, akin to a hamburger place deciding they're spending too much on ketchup and starting to bottle their own. To me, a restaurant should do what they do well (cook) and buy their condiments. It's forced me to give up their baba ganoush though, on the bright side, I'm now eating their cilantro jalapeno hummus which requires no accompaniment.   But, honestly, bring back the name brand Sriracha.",

I ordered the spicy chicken wrap and the iced chai tea. The 1 star is for the tea, it's great. The food was horrible. First off the menu says hot sauce, it's just sriracha (which is not Mediterranean). Secondly, the food was wrapped poorly, there was a gaping hole and pretty much made it impossible to eat as a wrap. Eventually, I just had to take off the foil and eat it with a fork and knife. Lastly the taste, it tastes like they mixed steamed vegetables, unseasoned chicken, beans, rice, some garlic, and sriracha. It's just depressing. It  felt like I was eating the worst fried rice of my life with some mushy pita bread on side.",

Tonight for example, I began calling to place a takeout order at 7:30pm and from 7:30 to 7:50 I called 6 times and the phone just rang with no answer. I went to the location and ask the person if you guys still took phone orders and he said yes, why? I explained my story and the response was - well the bartender is on to go's. He was very nice and accommodating and even got the food out quick but the bartender had about half the bar wide open. She was not busy. I am just very disappointed as it seems to be a common theme on Monday/Tuesday that when I try to order via the phone either no one answers or they \"don't put the order in\" or something like that. So go for the food just avoid trying to ordering takeout or sitting at the bar in Mondays and Tuesdays.",

This is the second time I have ordered a curry chicken salad, and it came out terrible (hence the review: two bad experiences). The chicken just seems like grilled chicken with no curry flavor (and very little of it), and it's almost entirely lettuce (hardly any brown rice). What makes this salad great is all the flavors, especially the curry. I'm pretty disappointed I spent that much for a salad that was severely lacking in the flavor department. If I had time, I would've taken it back. Be warned: this location underperforms.",

Being on a cross country road trip has its downs when sick in the middle of nowhere and eating greasy, unhealthy food. Well, let me just say that Pita Jungle had amazing options of healthy food that actually tasted great too!  For example, I got something off of their seasonal menu which was basically a Chili with quinoa. My husband despises quinoa, but when he tried my dish, he wanted to eat all of it! Haha, it was really good, and for less than 6 bucks, I'd go here everyday if I could.   The outdoor seating was really nice with ambient lighting. It's a relaxed setting. I will say that service was a bit slow, it looked like some of the servers were doing their closing side work. We didn't have any napkins the entire time.   Besides the service tho, I'd definitely go here again if I am to stop by Phoenix",

We did not feel rushed at any time and the server was very attentive. We shared a Caramelized Chicken Pizza (Lavosh) and a small Greek salad.  The flavors were great.

Last time I went there for lunch with my 6 of my coworkers we waited for one hour, (even after we called and told them a big group was coming for a birthday). We didn't get our drinks refilled and barely got our food 5 min before we had to leave to go back to work and one of our orders got lost/was forgotten (most of us only get a 60 min break for lunch so no time to get lunch sonewhere else). The manager was nice enough to not charge us for our food. I didn't wanna go back during lunch because of what happened to us last time but five of us went back today (again, food here's delicious! ) and we had the same issue again. We waited for 50 min, other tables were served before we got our food (and some of them arrived after we did) and 5 min before leaving, our food arrived. We even sat outside just so we didn't have to wait extra time for a table inside the restaurant.   I understand lunch time's a busy time in the kitchen ans the restaurant was packed but this is a recurrent issue every time we've been there. It's unfortunate because their food is very good. My gyro was yummy and very tender. The garlic potatoes weren't all that great today.   All in all, I don't think I'm coming back. I understand this isn't a fast food chain and it takes time to prepare your order but more servers/cooks during lunch time may be a good investment for this restaurant. I work Downtown and I can get yummy food close by without having to drive/wait for over 45 min to end up either eating super fast before I have to go and not enjoying my food (which is the main reason to get out of the office) or taking my food to go and eating it on my desk, which is what I want to avoid when I go out to eat.",

So I sat for another 7 or so minutes.... a female server plopped down 2 menus and said she would be back to give me water... I asked if it was still happy hour and she said, \"yes, until 6:00\".... she never returned.  I waved my arms around just before 6:00 and asked for service.  Another person took my order.  Another 15 minutes went by and another person delivered the order.  After a while, I waved my arms around again to get the attention of someone to get napkins and more water.  My guest joined me around 6:30... the original server took her order which was received about 30 minutes later :( I was getting quite an arm workout waving my arms to receive attention.  It got close to 8:00 and the final arm waving was to request a check.  Another server brought it over. Never have had such poor service... ever.   The food is great but I will never return to this establishment.",

I find myself returning just for them!  I've tried the food but wasn't a fan, I find most of it bland. Same for their desserts. The \"Gambas Can Ajo\" for instance needed more garlic and the sauce was too thin. The \"Rice Pudding\" lacked cinnamon or really any flavor.  The service can go either way, sometimes they are attentative, other times not so much.   They do have a parking garage right next door which is excellent for being downtown.  Overall, the smoothies are the winner here!",

I ordered the gyro. I would say it was decent, but nothing really stood out to me in terms of taste. I'm used to eating gyros in Portland food carts or restaurants catering specifically for Mediterranean food. I assume since this is a restaurant is a place that caters to people who want healthier options, the flavor goes down a bit? They didn't have french fries (which I'm always craving) so the waitress recommended roasted potatoes. The taste was....as you would expect cubed, roasted potatoes to taste. Again, not extraordinary, but edible. Service was pretty friendly and the restaurant was clean",

The interior is large and modern, not at all what I expected from the outside. The service was amazing, and out waitress answered all of our questions, even offering suggestions on what to order. Because we were there during happy hour, the tapas were a really great way to get small servings of a lot of things and still call it a meal :)   I highly recommend the salmon dish and the cilantro jalapeno hummus. Everything was amazing but those were definitely my favorite dishes. Our waitress also suggested mixing the lemonade with the guava iced tea as a refreshing drink, which I loved a lot!",

The staff was awesome in helping find out what dishes could be made vegan, which was great!   I ordered the falafel wrap as a bowl instead of a wrap so the onions, falafel, and tomatoes were on top of a bed of rice with the tahini sauce on the side. It was delicious and tasted super healthy and the tahini sauce was perfect. On the side I had the tabbouleh salad because tabbouleh salad is my favorite and I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty it was. I wish there would have just been a little bit more tomatoes. Both left me feeling like a nourished my body with the right food, rather than feeling bloated, like some restaurants do.   Anyways, it was kind of busy but the to go service was speedy fast, so way to go on that!

Allow me to get on my soap box for a minute.  I'm a water-drinking kind of girl and I'm not going to apologize for that.  Just because I'm drinking the free water doesn't mean I don't want my glass refilled as fast as my dinner companion who may be drinking the ice tea.  You refill the ice tea - you refill the water. It's simple. So why do I have to remind the staff to refill my glass? Every. Time. Here in endeth my rant.   Seriously though if you're a vegetarian (like me) or you like Mediterranean food (also me) this is a good place.  Not great but good.  (I really don't think chain restaurants can be great but the familiarity is comforting.)   However the baklava is great!! If I was just rating the baklava that would get 5 stars. And the bartender Celia is very nice and chatty which we appreciate in a bartender.    Mostly we come here for the happy hour when money is tight.  You can stuff yourself on tapas and get a huge beer and the bill is only like $20!! (For two people)   If the service improves I will consider changing this review to 4 Stars.",

    "text": "I'm pretty obsessed with Pita Jungle. I've never had a single bad thing on the menu. In addition to good food that offers healthy and vegan offerings, their happy hour is awesome with small portions and cheap prices on food and drinks. The staff has always been friendly to me here- although can be a bit frazzled during lunch hour. I love the patio too!  A couple of tips:  - the Lavosh Chicken Schwarma, Chicken Pasta Salad, and Chicken del Sol are my go-to favorites. Add a little sriracha to the Lavosh Chicken Schwarma for a spicy kick!  - if you're planning to go during weekday lunch, go between 11-11:30 a.m. After 11:45 a.m. it's a mad house. - there's no getting around it: the parking sucks here. There are only a few spots available next to restaurant and in the parking garage before you have to find street parking. Carpool whenever possible.",

The food is good for Americanized slightly bland version of Middle Eastern food. I can make better hummus at home for about $1, but when I'm lazy, this will do.  At least they use quality olives & pickles. I'm not saying I won't eat here again, because I will, but I'll definitely be in casual clothes and have my credit card ready so I don't have to wait an extra 15 minutes for the staff dressed as regular people to hopefully come back and finish my transaction.  If you like mediocre gyros and hummus and don't want to wait forever, PIta Jungle isn't bad.  It's just not phenomenal either.",

One of the main reasons was because when we used their restroom it was SUPER clean and so was the eating area and kitchen. Another reason was that the food smelled lovely!  Fortunately, we decided to give it a try. The staff was super nice and helpful. We opted for the outside seating which was lovely in the perfect weather! The patio was super nice and I felt like I was in Europe NOT in the U.S. I really loved the ambiance, decor, and presentation.  I ordered the shrimp and OMG it was sooooooooooo good! The shrimp was sauteed in onions, crushed garlic, and tomatoes. It came with pizza slices shaped pita with pesto spread. OMG! I cannot emphasize how delicious and flavorful it was.   I highly recommend this place!",

I stood there in an empty restaurant while the too cool to be bothered chatted among themselves instead of doing their job. When the hostess/server finally approached she demonstrated her lack of clairvoyance by asking me if I was there to pick up an order.  Apparently someone eating alone must be getting take out. After informing her I was there to eat food at a table she took me to a table with an attitude.  Seriously people, grow up!  You'r not impressive to anyone but yourselves and that's a very very tiny universe you live in.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that Pita Jungle is my favorite casual restaurant in the Phoenix area.  I go to Pita Jungle SEVERAL times a month.  That said, this location is seriously lacking in SO many areas.  I actually lived on the same block as this Pita Jungle for awhile.  I waited patiently for it to open, which seemed to take forever since I passed by it daily with its \"OPENING SOON\" sign mocking me.  I have eaten at this location about fifteen times, conservatively.  So, this review is a compilation of the last several visits.  First - don't order take out from this location.  Whereas the other locations in the Valley seem to replicate the dishes you see in the restaurant in your takeout container, this location skimps and gives you much less food.  I usually have to box up about half of my dish when dining in, but I can usually eat everything when I get it to go from this location.  Plus they tend to just throw everything into the box, making it look incredibly messy and unattractive.    Second - the wait staff routinely disappears on you... especially during happy hour.  Whereas in other PJs the waitstaff makes it a point to check in on you to make sure you can get your last orders in for happy hour, this PJ seems to want to avoid you at all costs.  I understand they make less tip money on the items; However, the quicker people get their food, the more food they will likely order.    Third -  when you're sitting on the patio in the Summer, you get forgotten (even though the host seats you).  This has happened to me on MULTIPLE occasions.  I understand it is hot outside.  If I choose to sit outside on a day when it is above 100 degrees, I should not be punished by having to sit outside longer than necessary.  When it is hot, I need more water, more frequently.  If you cannot make it outside, can you leave extra water?  Can I expect a waiter to actually come take my order within twenty minutes of me being seated?  If not, you need to close your patio in the Summer.  Fourth - they do not have a firm grasp on how to prepare the kids' menu items.  Not only are the portions MUCH smaller here than at ALL the other Valley PJs, but they are not the same.  Sometimes the chicken is the broiled chicken.  Sometimes it is some kind of chicken with a red hue.  Sometimes the mac and cheese is so runny it sloshes on the plate.  Sometimes it is a globby mess.  When DD orders broccoli at the other PJs, she gets a portion the size of an average man's fist.  At this PJ, she always get about three small twigs of broccoli.    Fifth - I know it is downtown, but your waiters should not have attitude.  There are plenty of more chic, more hip, more cool, more \"it\" restaurants all around town for those kind of servers to work at.    Most Recent Visit - We recently had a server who was really sweet and cute from North Dakota.  Of course, he forgot to take our order (he didn't see us out on the patio, but saw every other table) and then got my order wrong when he did take it.  We were also served 15-20 minutes after every other table on the patio (who were ALL seated after us).  We were dining with a 4 year old who was starving, sweating and at her limit by the time her food finally arrived (some forty minutes after ordering it... and it came after all the other entrees were served).    Overall, I do not recommend this location of Pita Jungle.  It is such a shame, too.  It is in a prime location and I have a lot of friends and business in the area.",

The mango lemonade is yummy. Biggest drawback is no menu changes in 5+ years. I guess if it works why change but I would add some more choices. For example their Pita falafel is mediocre and they are the Pita Jungle.",

    "text": "I love the pita sandwiches here, especially the Philly Steak Pita, but for the price they charge, they should at least come with a side.  The sandwich looks lonely on the plate with not even a garnish to accompany it.  The filling is tasty and juicy, however if you don't remove it from the foil (which is meant to keep it warm), the steam will make the pita too soft and it will fall apart on you. My favorite side is the garlic potatoes, unfortunately I have never gotten them HOT, always half luke-warm, half cold, and let's face it, they don't seem like they were cooked in the last hour.  The last one I had, had plenty of garlic, however half of it was raw, which made the whole dish bitter. It is nice that they have varieties of Ice Tea, however they don't have regular ice tea as an option. Located in a rehabilitated building, the location is convenient to downtown, but has limited parking, and is always busy.  If you manage to get in without waiting, consider yourself lucky.",

Service was good, the a nice mix of attentive and patient. My friend actually lives in Scottsdale, so it took him longer to make it there than it took us, so the waiter was chill about us sitting at the table drinking iced tea for half an hour before my friend arrived. I wouldn't go as far as to call it excellent, but a solid \"good\".  The menu offered several yummy sounding options, but having eaten Lucky Wishbone one last time a few hours before when we left Tuscon, I really just wanted a light snack while visiting with my friend. So lucky for us, we were there during \"happy hour\" which offered plenty of very inexpensive snack options ($1 hummus trio, $2 fallafel, etc.) We were able to get a nice sampling of tastes on the cheap, and satisfy the snack level hunger while catching up with my friend... i couldn't really ask for more..   The iced tea was also very tasty! If I lived in Phoenix, I would certainly go back :)",

The best part of having this great new place is that its only 1 block away from where I live, perfect walking distance.  The only thing I did not like about this place was that it closes way to early 10 pm and on First Friday it should stay open to at least 12 or 1am. Hope they adjust those hours soon, so Check it out.... =o)",

Our waiter was a bit of a putz. He forgot our hummus plate before hand, and then got one of our orders wrong. Decided to eat it anyways, and it was good, just not what i was expecting. I dont know how long they have been open, so Ill pass and give them a break this time. It is a bit fancier than the other pita jungle out in Arcadia. The big mirror was just odd to me. But just the same as the place out in Arcadia, it seems beautiful people seem to flock to this place for some reason. My attention was diverted more than once with some of the business women coming in. =) I definately will give it another go once I feel its been open a while to see if the service gets better.",

    "text": "The food at Pita Jungle was nothing spectacular. I was excited to go here because of the great reviews. First of, we ordered a few things of the happy hour menu, hummus, baba ganoush, lemon chicken and one more which I've already forgotten. The lemon chicken was decent quantity and had some flavor. The rest of the apps were mediocre with regard to taste and tiny tiny servings! I had the chicken platter and my husband a gyro. His gyro was decent, but my platter was not..the chicken was dry and the beans very plain. The pita they served was also dry and stale. I wouldn't go here again.",

    "text": "First off, glad to see someone move into the Gold Spot building!! Got my husband to come and try Pita Jungle, even though he says no the Greek food.... The building is done up nicely, with a great outdoor patio area. The beers on draft are first rate, and the happy hour tapas menu (all for $1 !!) is great for chatting and sharing.  We ordered wayyyy too much, as the plates are very large. We shared the Greek salad, fresh and tasty. Husband had the Phillie Pita... huge, and hot, tasty and given a good review by him, with a \"I could do this again\". I had the Tuna Pita. It was great, but I thought it was tuna in a pita, and it was greens with tuna on top with a pita on the side. Was great, but huge!! Then we shared two of the one dollar tapas plates, the falafal and the hummus trio. Both good...  Service was wonderful, and the whole experience was good. Glad to have them in the hood, a new place to ride our bikes or scooters to!!",

I always ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad which was perfectly textured - until they started replacing the lettuce with parsley.  Now it is almost inedible.  The prices seem to have steadily climbed as well.  Last week, my lunch crew decided we will not be going back for lunch because prices have risen to much and the quality of the food has declined.   18 bucks out the door is a lot of money for sandwiches and salad at what is essentially an upscale fast food joint.",

    "text": "I have to say I have tried this Pita Jungle Downtown location multiple times to give it a fair chance to display their quality of service and food.   I have been here during high and low traffic times.  Each time has been the most horrible display of customer service in the metropolitan Phoenix area.  I'm a huge foodie, so in that sense I do admit that the food that I have ordered so far has been up to par.  So, kudos to the cooks.  I recently gave this location one last chance and to no surprise they failed at providing even the most basic and courteous customer service.  Regarding the servers I have gotten each time I dine here:  raggedy clothes that are tattered and too small to be worn, simple ponytail hairdos look like they were done by a 2 year old, their fingernails are way too disgustingly long to be anywhere near food.  Ew...Gross.  And nasty stuck up attitudes.    The last time I dined here I was much more attuned to my environment and my server, hoping for a better experience.  We were sat down by the host at the long community table.  After a long wait (the restaurant was not extremely busy) our server finally stopped by to take our order.  We made a few modifications to our order and she rolled her eyes and sighed like we were being a huge bother.   Our entrees came out before our appetizers.  Seriously, can they get someone to manage the food window in a more organized fashion?  A different server came out, apologized,  and gave us our appetizers.  While sitting at our table (which is right behind wall/area where the servers fill drinks) my friend and I overheard servers talking about customers they were serving.  We heard offensive language and rude blatant comments about customers.    Our jaws dropped.    Throughout the entirety of our meal, it was a chore to get our server's attention to refill our drinks.  She sure did know how to make us feel like a burden.  We finished our meal and got the heck out of dodge.    I have been in the restaurant/customer service industry for years and I am absolutely appalled by this restaurant.   It really does not take a genius to know what is proper attire and how to treat customers.  I understand this is a \"hipster-ish\" location but come on!   I will never eat here again and will warn everyone I know of this customer hating restaurant.",

It's a great space with outdoor seating on the corner of 3rd and Roosevelt and although I like the area, I can't take anymore of the low quality servings.    From what other reviewers have stated, maybe this location is bad.  I will try one of the others sometime in the future.  But for now I graded only three stars because:  1.  they put yogurt in the baba ghanouj.  Why?  Eggplant is one of my favorite foods and when made into baba ghanouj I'm expecting to have a vegan dish.  I don't want it thinned out with yogurt.  Yeah I know I'm a cry baby.  Waaahh waaaah waaah!  2.  the cooks use way too much cooking oil on the grilled veggies.  For every one of my veggie orders, I can only manage to eat the morsels sitting on top because the bottom ones are saturated with cooking oil.    I nearly threw up today when I bit into a slice of eggplant on the grilled vegetable salad.  It was a thick slice and cooking oil oozed out of it giving me a mouthful of sliminess. I used about five napkins trying to spit it all out.  The bed of greens on the salad had become translucent due to all the cooking oil settling to the bottom and I didn't even touch them.  Basically, half of my salad went to waste.   3.  they rarely get my order correct the first time.  4.  there are too many wait staffers standing around.  So there, I've said it.  I've bad mouthed the PJ.",

When the waitress (I can't remember her name) finally came up and said this isn't my table but I will start your order.

The service has become so terrible I have vowed to never go to this location again.  1. Called in a to go order to pick up on the way home from work. I arrive and was told it was not ready, in fact it wasn't even put in yet (15 min from work to pita) she apologized and offered me a soda. Cool I'll take it. Mistakes happen. 20 min layer my order was done but they forgot one of the meals. They hadn't even made it. I cut my losses paid and left. I shared the one meal with my husband. Lame  2. Seated outside, waitress was so uninterested in our table I felt like she was 1. About to go home or 2. About to quit  Took our order in a timely manner but was never seen again. No drink refills and never checked in on us   3. Was seated inside but waited about 15 min to only finally being approached after flagging someone down. There was a game letting out downtown so it was busy. They were obviously understaffed. The waiter was apologetic but still was having a hard time keeping up with the customers. Food was good as usual but the staff was more concerned with the large groups than my husband and I  4. Tonight.....we sat outside and waited..... Was approached by a friendly waitress who took our order. The food was brought out by someone else.  We had no silverware and had to ask ....and never saw another employee again. Frustrated my husband went inside to pay our waitress (also the bartender) who we saw through the outdoor window talking to customers/employees and texting. No drink refills or check ins.  Our bill was $66 that is too much to pay for a terrible experience. Sorry pita, you taste yummy but your service has been consistently terrible. I will drive to another location that is out of my way before going back to this location.",

This place is filled with a variety to choose from on the menu...  It was cleaner than the Pita Jungle in Peoria.",

However on the night of 9/5, we stopped in to get a bite, the mushroom burger and falafel bowl to be exact. The burger wasn't bad, but the beans on the side were cold, and the falafel bowl was made with cold and what felt and tasted like day old rice. It also lacked any sort of seasoning not even simple salt and pepper it was literally flavorless. There was also what looked like maybe one price of cold falafel chopped into bits mixed in. I really hope this location can improve.",

Their hummus platters allow you pick between three different types and they're even flexible even to allow you to do half and half. Got an order to-go and they did everything right w/ respect to ensuring we had everything we needed from a flatware standpoint to enjoy a nice \"car picnic.\" They use actual lavash for their wraps, rather than tortillas, which was legit and appreciated.

I had the black bean burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my LIFE, meatless or otherwise. It was seasoned to perfection and so was the potatoes. It came with tahini sauce, which I've never had before, but I loved that too! Everything tasted like it was freshly made, and not that over processed heat it and eat it mess. My friend ordered a side of baked cauliflower that was dressed in caramelized onions and that was amazing too! I definitely recommend this place whether you are a vegan or not.",

Our apartment complex is full of people who can both afford to live here and also eat out with some pretty fair regularity, and also who love their dogs. It may be to your benefit to apply to Maricopa County Environmental Services Department for a Dog Friendly Patio Permit Application if you have not already done so.  It is a fairly simple application and, from what I understand, nearly always approved.   As for my experience, it was four months ago. I wrote my yelp review while standing outside, across the street, astonished. Perhaps that gives you a timeline, but other than that, I can only tell you the server was a young male and that he was very, very rude.  Nearly all of the local businesses have dog friendly patios, good food and friendly staff. Pita Jungle was among my favorite but until my dog can come along, I won't be back.   Thank you for your time.   Holly",

The food was delicious! Definitely not your run of the mill pita place.   My only complaints would be that our food took a while to come out, and that when something burned it the kitchen, the smoke flooded into the dining area because of the open-air concept.",

I said thank you, to which you mustered up a thanks. You obviously think you're very cool and important - with your black hair, plastered on makeup, and diamond finger tattoo (how original on that one). You're not important, Sam. And if Pita Jungle has any idea what they're doing, they'll fire you. You're terrible at providing customer service, which is probably one of the easiest professions out there. I've done it.

First of all, we love the patio. It really is a great place to chill on a weekend afternoon. Our favorites include the hummus, the gyro (they put a pickle in it!), salads and the Sharwarma wrap. We visited on New Years Day for lunch and it was great as usually. We tried the Lentil Soup (for good luck), and it definitely impressed.   If I was going to give Pita Jungle a knock, I would bring up the service. The servers all seem like college kids and don't seem very experienced. When they get busy, the service usually starts to fall apart. We have had a few mediocre experiences here, but for the most part it has been great.  I definitely recommend!",

    "text": "I must be hitting the jackpot lately on dining at less busy times!  I can't think about anything not to rave about!  First, let me say I immediately noticed a difference in the atmosphere from this location to desert ridge. I liked it, definitely felt like we were \"downtown\".  I came with the bf and his buddy, and we all gawked at the HUGE mirror on the wall with very unique knicknacks framing this monstrosity.  The \"executive\" seats were also a nice plus and a step up from aforementioned location. We also stared at the hugely inviting booths that were sadly all occupied, but luckily our seats were nice and comfy anyway.  We got the hummus as an appetizer of course, with chicken. Mmm Mmm Mmm mmm! The 3 pitas brought weren't quite enough and they do charge for extra, but its $0.39, nothing to squawk about. The hummus plate is so large and generous, and it could not be left to waste. I don't know what the chicken is marinated in, but I would like to learn, and replicate it at my house!   Friend got the spicy chicken wrap and coconut curry soup. The soup was in quite a big bowl but I was focused on the hummus and did not try it. I did try the spicy chicken, and it had a nice flavor to it. The wrap is gigantic btw. My bf got the wood fired chicken special, and it was also humongous. Huge portion of chicken breast over broccoli(came with spinach but he subbed, n/c) and garlic smashed potatoes with enough tomatoes to feed an army. Okay maybe not an army, but plenty of extra for me!!! Those tomatoes were so tasty, almost like bruschetta. I want to go back again soon and find those tomatoes in another dish, I hope!  Then there was one of the best pizzas I've had in my life. I was feeling incredibly indecisive today, but this pesto pizza called out to me, and I added chicken (for $1.79). Holy Mother World of Flavors! Even my bf said my dish was the best at the table.  This delicious pita pizza was packed! Pesto, feta, spinach, mushroom, tomato, chicken, topped with melted mozzarella.  Again, I consider myself a completely stuck up pizza snob, and I would not have changed a thing about this!  Good service too, but to be honest, I like the food so much this is one place I would still go back even if the service wasn't good!",

This location is airy and open; dare I say - spacious?!!  Parking can be a little snark inspiring but once you get past that and get into the actual restaurant, take a deep breath and enjoy of the wonderfullness of PJ without having to rub elbows with the people at the tables on either side of you.  ;)",

Whenever we are trying to decide where to go eat pita is always first choice.  Pita jungle is and will always be my favorite place to eat.",

Gluten free options abound, and all of them are tasty.  I've eaten here about five times and never been disappointed.  One occasion was a large group with shared tapas and the staff handled it very smoothly. My favorite dish is the hummus (regular plain Jane flavor) with chicken and cucumbers on the side to replace the pita.  Mmmm.  They also have a full bar and, at least the times I was there, a decent bartender.",

    "text": "I have loved Pita Jungle for years. I've spent countless hours attempting to duplicate their Shawarma chicken, lemon dressing and babaganoush at home. I've never quite succeeded and that's always sent me going back because boy do I LOVE these flavors.  This is the first time I've ever gone to a Pita Jungle and thought to myself \"this is a restaurant in decline.\" To be fair it's my first visit to the Roosevelt location - but then again, the hallmark of a good restaurant is consistency. The location is, I think, evidence that Pita Jungle is over-extending itself. Lavish in size and appurtenances, it has that undeniable vibe that says clearly \"THIS AIN'T CHEAP!\" This is in direct contradiction to the previous locations I have visited (Indian School and Apache) which have always tended toward the spartan.   That expense appears to be taking its toll. The \"large\" baba - as delicious as ever - is served stingily, spread out over the plate but less in volume than I've been served before when I ordered a small. It is served studiously with one (1) each: tomato wedge, cucumber slice, kalamata olive. The small Greek salad is nearly half the portion I have gotten at the other locations. I always ordered small because it was more than enough to feed me and large was out of the question. Here it resembles a side salad at Dennys.  All of this smacks of cost savings at the expense of portions and man, that is my definition of a restaurant that is in trouble. Pita Jungle, I love you, But I spent $33 for two people drinking water at lunch only to wish that instead I'd spent my money manufacturing my own inferior versions at home because I walked away hungry. No amount of impressive decor can make up for this. I have been pleased by your success, but now you're over-reaching. I hope it doesn't kill you.  Edit: I upped this to three stars because I kind of felt guilty. At the end of the day the food is still  just as wonderful as it always has been, but the portions were weak and I figured two stars was a bit extreme.",

    "text": "I've come full circle with Pita Jungle, having lunched there often  when it was a single restaurant near ASU where I was a student. Now, it's moved in a few blocks from my home and office in downtown Phoenix, in addition to locations throughout the state. So yes, it's a chain, but I forgive its chain status because it's a local chain with local origins.  This new location is just what downtown needed, and a good move for the restaurant too. The space is huge, and fills up the Gold Spot corner beautifully, right next to the charming Lola Coffee. The food is what I've always liked about Pita Jungle: Mediterranean style with creative diversions, a lot of healthy fare, hummus, baba ganoush, all that good stuff. This time I spotted a new entree that caught my attention: chicken tikka masala. Nothing wrong with that, as chik-tik is actually an invention of British-Indian restaurants, and not an authentic \"Indian\" meal per se. So I tried it. It was nothing like typical Indian restaurant chik-tik, not quite as greasy, but still flavor-packed, and tasty. I'd get it again.   I'll be back often for lunch.",

The location is cool and the spacious area is bright, and great to eat in.   Unfortunately, the times I've been there, the food wasn't so good. The dolmades I had were mushy and too sour. The pasta salad was incredibly bland. The gambas con ajo was better, but not at all special. The mozzarella, tomato and basil wasn't too good, either. The mozzarella tasted old...  The atmosphere is friendly enough that you can go and have a drink and get a quick bite, as long as you stick with the hummus...",

    "text": "The new Pita Jungle freaking rocks. I haven't been to one in years, but I can see them quickly becoming a new favorite.   Ambience gets an 8.5 so far.    I'd have to spend more time in the inside and see the bathrooms to finalize it. but it was pretty kicking Monday night at 7:30 three days after their opening with a lively crowd--somewhat unusual and definitely welcome for Downtown.  Good parking right off the patio was open during my two hours there.   But we walked there, taking our seats in the patio in the back after a friendly greeting with the bartender.  The *full bar* window sits *very nicely* between the inside and patio which combined make a very un-Phoenix like setting, something I'm really fond of getting used to downtown.    Inside, I was instantly taken aback by the pleasant configuration of the cavernous interior.  I soberly staggered about, grinning idiotically.  Its a use of space that easily beats the last tenant, a fly-by-night home-foreclosure help-line.  I didn't miss the always-closed design firm that was there before either.    I admit my continued giddiness.  Outside was comfortable and quiet for the most part except for the occasional headlight glare.  We were the only ones seated on the spacious patio.  But it wasn't isolated; foot traffic from folks driving up, walking in like they weren't from the neighborhood along with folks who lived next door--all nice people--added to the pleasant urban dichotomy of entrances in front and back.  Service gets a 9.5/10.   Our position outside in view of the bar made it easy to be seen, so I can't say the same for the inside but have high expectations.    The staff should read the directions/learn how to turn the heater on instead of depending on the later arrival of the one bestowed with that knowledge.  I'm guessing enough restaurant patrons would have just gotten colder and more irritated while they waited, I'm not that kinda guy.  I chocked it up to an opening day jitter and pushed both buttons in.  The food came out wicked quick, and the super cute waitresses were friendly, patient, and otherwise on top of everything.     A phone call before we left was answered promptly and courteously.  They said they were \"not busy\", but were crowded when we walked in, suggesting they know how to deal with traffic.    Food gets an 8/10.   To start off, it was $5 for what I think was 20oz of a perfect Devil's Ale:  a fun, big glass with a handsome head...Drink me, it begged, and I happily obliged.  Served cold, it warmed me right up.  If a buck (or two? please?) were off the beer and the joint stayed open till 4 AM...it'd be a madhouse.  We can dream, but I doubt the looming apartments would enjoy that kind of big city vibe off the patio.      In the meantime, they could have had more warm drinks besides the tasty hot chocolate for the winter. Lola Coffee next door could hopefully provide some of that vibe for some real synergy if they stayed open later.  The tzatziki put me in food paralysis--a heavenly feeling I get when I first take a bite of something and it's that amazingly good all other senses shut off.  I kind of wondered at the better part of $8 for my companion's small pesto pizza with no meat but it too was a 10/10.  The beef gyro was some points lower, I seem to recall enjoying its selection of stock greens (I just killed it this morning as I write this),  but the meat was average and a bit lacking on the sauce.  Either way, they  made up for it with a hearty, filling portion that should be an easy standby for any carnivore, especially one on a budget...   ... but take the gyro by itself.   It doesn't quite work next to its $3 up-sell garlic potatoes which were mediocre in the beginning and went cold quick.  Skip 'em.   Still, the potatoes along with everything else wait in my fridge for the next day like everything else I took home.  Shouldn't be too hard to give them enough kick again in a toaster oven or microwave.  The rice pudding was served cold and average on its own (maybe that's the point?), but it was definitely enlivened with the right amount of cinnamon and half the amount of fresh fruit they put on top.  Total bill was $36 before tip. For appetizer, main course, dessert, and beverage for two in such a expletively awesome place, it's definitely worth it.   As a quick dinner to go, it's a major, major reason to not hit the local fast food joints in the late evenings too.  8.8 out of 10 for my best luck to the latest addition downtown, the newest for all of 4 days before Vitamin T opens up.    What bad economy?  I sometimes wonder. =)",

Sooo last night we decided to venture to the downtown location for another go together (I've been plenty of times and love it so I was super excited) and we kind of had to sit and wait again for a server....10 minutes later-not that long but no one even stopped by to tell us they'd be with us soon-once our server came by she totally ROCKED!  made me so glad that bf changed his opinions a bit, I think her name was Alisha? anyways, we had a great time just hanging out on the patio drinking wine and eating reverse happy hour, which by the way is super cheap $1-2 tappas and then drink specials as well.  we walked out of there with a bill of $26 for 2 glasses of wine, 1 beer and like 6 tappa plates :)   love the location, service and food...hopefully next time they'll jump all over us right when we sit down so bf stops teasing me about having to wait ;)",

Who would have thunk all those dam brined pea lookin things on the Pizza Hut buffet would ever make it into my stomach again... Pretty darn tasty stuff if you ask me and the Pita Jungle's Cilantro Hummus is made fresh and served perfectly chilled. The Portobello Burger is quite a meal and really appreciate the fresh baked bun. Our server Josselyn was a charming young lady with an old Hayden Mill Flour Sack T-shirt that I must have. Good times and you'll be seeing more of me around these parts.",

I sometimes go on my own and sit on the patio side at the bar which is also nice.    Everything I've tried on the menu is good and tasty.  Lavosh pizzas are great, the Turkey Pesto Lavash Wrap is awesome, though I think it's pretty chintzy to charge for extra dressing (really, is it like made of gold???).  Many good options for vegans and vegetarians too; the Lentil Fattoush Salad is a particularly good stand out.    A great place to go for a healthy and affordable meal.  Enjoy!",

This is something I was aggravated by at the Tempe location is they have no bar, and the Indian School location has no patio. They also did a teriffic job of keeping the integrity of the old Gold Spot Market that they are located inside.   The service here is impeccible just as normal with Pita Jungle. Friendly servers, cute waitresses, prompt delivery from the kitchen, and efficient seating. The food is high quality, tasty, and inexpensive. The black bean burger is probably my favorite dish here.

    "text": "I'm a usual at the downtown pita jungle. Worked in the industry for a long time and love this place. The food is consistent and amazing. There not stingy and they really wanna make sure you enjoyed your food. The downtown pita jungle is really quick with to-go orders and its so nice to be able to grab a coffee at lolas next door or relax while waiting for your food, location is killer. So without a doubt this place is definitely a five star for the food. But the reason for this review was with my last visit in to my neighborhood pita I was pleasantly surprised with 2 of the employees. Walking in I was greeted at the door with a huge smile and not the everyday cliche line of \"welcome\" but a \"hello,  how's your day going, lets get you inside and out of the heat\" I did go at a busy time and the young gentlemen (jose i think) had to put me on a small wait. He than asked if I needed anything while I waited, he went out if his way to grab me a water. Unlike usual hosts this gentleman didn just stand at the host area he was walking around looking for tables and even bussed my table and a few of the  other tables as well. He got me seated as soon as he could. This was just the starting to my great visit! I was sat in a nice area by the window, my waitress Colleen came as soon as she saw me and took another drink order. She was very good with me, always coming to refill my drinks my food was prompt and she helped me try something new! The restirant was very busy but she didnt make me feel rushed or was short with me because she was stressed about her other tables. THIS IS HOW RESTAURANTS SHOULD BE. Colleen was restaurant responsible with the small talk not in any way inappropriate and very sweet and genuine. To say the least I was very pleased. Jose and Colleen were both well dressed, hair done and well put  together unlike some  service staff at pita jungle I have had before. I recommend this place without a doubt! And if you haven't already you should be trying my new fav the grilled veggie salad! :)",
