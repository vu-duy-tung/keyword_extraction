The inside is nicely decorated with painted plumerias and a vibrant saltwater tank.   The service was slightly slow and disorganized yet not horrible.  The Ahi tuna roll was fresh, flavorful and filling. The Macadamian Nut Mahi Mahi was better than what I read on the prior reviews and the dish was accompany with crisp cooked asparagus and properly seasoned potatoes. The chocolate flourless torte cake was the best of all. As I cut my fork into the delicious piece in front of me, I see a warm chocolate center oozing onto my plate like lava exploding out of a volcano. The taste is perfection in my mouth and worth the 3 miles on the treadmill.  I also found out the restaurant offers both regular happy hour and reverse happy hour. Prices are only valid at bar and not formal dining area. Go to their website to view the aloha happy hour menu.",

App for the table were calamari, caterpillar rolls, poke bowl, and lobster potstickers - all very good and fresh. Anyway, two of the group order the roasted Macademia nut crush Mahi-Mahi entrees were a bit overcook but flavorful. Two other had the shell fish sampler - they ran out of scallop that night- so got a crab cake substitute. Must say that the crab cakes were not as good as Chula's or Fleming's...but enjoyable with good size lobster tails. I had the Filet Mignon with Teppan Shrimp -  And that was a well ages and tasty steak! It was spectacular of the night. We finished off the table with two Souffle \"LAVA\" cake with Vanilla ice cream. That's pretty sum up a great dinner.  Why 4 star and not 5 - no scallop, the \"well done\" Mahi Mahi, and not enough crabbies in the crab cakes.",

Then.. the lobster came out stuffed with crab and upon cracking the claw we found the meat to be completely raw still blue in color. We asked the waitress who was very accommodating to bring this to the chef who preceded to tell her it was fully cooked. He then left for the night we were told. Appetizers and dessert were great and whole meal was comped. It had potential and we believe it just may have been a rush service toward the end of the night however serving completely raw lobster is dangerous.

    "text": "\"Making it okay to have seafood in phoenix\"  Yes, yes, that sounds like an awful thing to say! But it really is True, I have had some fabulous seafood dishes in phoenix and some that left a bit to be desired. A group of us came here for the pre-fixe menu. You get an entree and a regular size app for a fixed priced. It's actually a really good deal considering this place is err a little on the pricey side.  We sit down and everyone is super nice! As we wait for our orders, we are brought out some spicy thai like edamame. It was delish!  Before talking about my meal, let's talk about how absolutely knoweldgeable our waitress was. I hate I can't remember her name, but she was SUPERB.. I always say it is nice when you talk with someone who knows the menu down to how the best way to serve it is (i.e. fish should be medium because it loses flavor the longer it's cooked) but offered flexibility when I wanted my potstickers well done (texture always gets me).  My group has the crunch golden pot stickers and calamari - fantastic! They are really setting the tone for me.  For my entree I had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi - this was mahvelous and cooked to absolute perfection. The spicy mustard that accompanied with it took it over the edge! Everything else my group ordered was good as well. People had no complaints which is hard to do in big groups.  Last but not least, dessert. There was some chocolate goodness and something else. I'm not a big fan of desserts, but for those who are.. these were quite tasty!  Would totally go back and Mondays made it way more reasonable.",

I can understand why at one point after 2:30 pm on a Sunday we were the only patrons there when we left an hour later no more than eleven individuals were dining. Our eating utensils were dirty and spotty, we were told by the waitress that polished silverware is reserved for evening dining (unbelievable)! The manager returns to our table with the explanation, \"you all caught me in the middle of polishing the utensils\"...so she gave us a clean set. Then we wanted to try the grilled shrimp and was told the shrimp was for evening only, but she would ask the chef, and were presented with a large plate and four small shrimp for $16. she explained the small shrimp were $4 each, a price invented because the appetizer is not on the menu. Needless to say we will never return.",

    "text": "Love Love Love this place.  I have been to Roy's at many locations and especially enjoyed the Roy's on Maui, but this is one of my favorites.  This place is amazing with a reoccurring Hawaiian theme, whats not to love!  It is a mix of European techniques and Asian cuisine while meeting Hawaiian hospitality.  Honestly, I love the Seared Ahi Tuna and get this dish most of the times come. But when I decide to change it up, I am never disappointed.  For the appetizers we loved the crunchy golden lobster pot-stickers, for the salads we loved the roasted beet salad and grilled pear salad and for the entrees (besides the Ahi Tuna) the crab dynamite baked barramundi is delicious(a little rich so be prepared),  the mahi mahi and Hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish is absolutely mouth watering!!! If you are reading this, you must go and try :)  I also heard from one of my friends that the filet mignon is one of the best around.  I have not had the chance yet to give it a whirl. So maybe a surf & turf next? Last but not least is the dessert.  This may be my favorite at any restaurant out there.  Roy's Chocolate Souffle.  A delicious chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream and a tad of raspberry sauce - it literally melts in your mouth.  This is a MUST, make sure you order it!  Remember, there is always room for dessert!  Monday nights are usually a fix priced 3-course menu, so you should check it out. Great deal if they still offer.  My friend and I have dined here many times and we have had some issues in the past with take-out food, so make sure your order is correct before leaving.  ALOHA!",

We came in for the second time on 5/9/15 to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, and Mother's Day. The food was good, but our server was a bit awkward and pushy, which I was not fond of.   I asked him if the lobster bisque risotto was more of a full dish of risotto, or if the risotto was merely a side--he responded by telling me all about the Ono fish. I had to ask my question again and he still wasn't getting it. I did end up ordering the dish and he said that I should have the fish cooked medium, I responded that, \"Unfortunately, I cannot have any undercooked food because I am pregnant and it's not safe for the baby. I need it well done please.\" Again he insisted that the chef recommends it only cooked to medium, and I became very frustrated at this point and told him, \"I don't care what the chef recommends. I'm pregnant and cannot eat it unless it's well done.\"  If I have to tell you TWICE of my consumption needs and you still don't get it and insist on me eating it a different way, I'm not happy. Under normal circumstances, I would love to have sushi or medium-cooked fish instead of a well-done filet. But when I tell you I'm pregnant, stop trying to force a piece of food down my throat that could make me sick and possibly terminate my pregnancy!!!   Also, the risotto was severely undercooked--I love risotto and pastas to be Al dente, as they're meant to, but this was completely raw grains of rice in some areas.   5/19/15 UPDATE: After posting my review, I was promptly contacted by managers from the restaurant to discuss the issues we had, which translated into better informing employees about sensitivity with pregnant womens' diets and not trying to force undercooked food on them. We were also sent a very generous giftcard to give the restaurant another try, which we will. The service we've received from the management staff has earned them another \"star\" in my rating",

Plus it had been well over a year since we had even visited Roy's, but they were the shiny star of my memories. Every thing you could ever want in a Seafood Restaurant.  When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion, I told them it was Rachel's B day. When we arrived they told her Happy Birthday and gave us special menus on the inside it said Happy Birthday Rachel and the date. Wow, I thought that was pretty amazing.  Our server was an amazing girl that thought of every thing. The manager even came over to wish my daughter a Happy Birthday. All the drinks were usurper! The food was truly amazing!! We had the Canoe for two for starters, even though there were 3 of us, there was more than enough. Plus, Mario got a salad which he said was delish!  We had the Butterfish , the Mahi Mahi , and the Old School combo,which was 4 fish dishes on one large dish.Mario had that one. Every thing was perfect, I mean everything.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Souffle and they even treated the Birthday girl to a wonderful Creme Burle, with fresh fruit and chocolate cake. They even put Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce on her dessert plate. Yes it is expensive but, at least you are getting what you pay for .  Great service and Great food.",

We ordered the lobster potstickers at his recommendation (10/10), and he so highly spoke of the fish that I ordered the Roy's trio of salmon, butter fish, and mahi mahi and it did not disappoint! Even if you aren't the biggest sea food fan it is so tender with such complex flavors anyone is bound to enjoy, but the non-seafood options are still a hit!

The fish was average.  The flavors were not unique, just tasted like gingery soy sauce, and their beef is standard fare.  Also, the service was subpar.  The server did not even offer us the option of wine, jumped right into the main courses and our water glasses were often left empty.  Next.",

The staff did an exceptional job. Their $5 happy hour menu is a pretty good size with pretty good portions, would recommend two if your creating a meal.  The prices are good for the happy hour selection but the full meal menu prices are  a lil steep ($25-$35, couple items up to $40) compared to surrounding restaurants but well worth it. I will definitely be visiting Roy's again as well as recommending it to others.",

This particular visit we had reservations for 8:30 and part of our group did not even arrive at our house until 9:00. The staff was very accommodating with the shift of our arrival time.   The food is to die for. I have enjoyed everything I have ordered. My favorites are the lobster pot stickers, calamari, and the chocolate souffle.   Roy's has their own cookbook and I would highly recommend purchasing it. Most of the recipes are relatively easy to make.   This is a great place to go for special events. We have been with small groups and large. The service is always spectacular!!!!!!",

Anways- started with the calamari and it was delicious.  This red sauce they have is really spicy and sweet at the same time and we asked for another serving of it.  The server told me she could write down the recipe but I told her no need- I am far too lazy to actually \"try\" and recreate it.  But the thought was nice.  I ordered this macadamia crusted mahi-mahi.  My dish came sitting on top of some mashed potatoes with 3 sticks of asparagus and 6 chopped slices of red potato.  I thought my dish was filling also.  bill was $99 bucks total with each of us getting one alcoholic beverage.  If i do return it will be for the calamari only.",

I know it's not fair, but I always root for the ma-and-pa-type places. Anyway, Roy's serves what they call \"Hawaiian Fusion,\" a blend of Asian and European flavors, using local ingredients, with an emphasis on seafood.   My husband and I went here for a date night (a rarity for us). The ambiance was lovely: Hawaiian without being like we were in a theme park. The service was attentive-- as it should be for an establishment with this price tag.  We had Lumpia (like an egg roll) for an appetizer, and it was very good. My entree was a different story though. I had the Chicken with Gorgonzola and I thought it just good-average. Dave had the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and loved it (but how can you screw up salmon?). The portions are rather small, although the presentation is very nice.   The dining room was very loud, and although as the parents of teenagers and toddlers we were used to it, Roy's might not be the perfect place for a romantic wedding proposal (Will I what???)",

I always get the Butter Fish which was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. However my husband got the Trio as did another person and they felt the Butter Fish was great but the other two fish selections were just mediocre. The pineapple upside cake was good but not outstanding as I would have expected. I guess it was because it was the holiday but I felt the server rushed us through the meal. She even delivered the check while we were still eating dessert. Without alcohol the bill for two people was $125.00 so it's truly a commitment to eat there. And, for that price I was to be wowed; which we weren't. So I think I'll try other high-end restaurant for my next special occasion.",

I went there late on a Sunday and the hostess let me know they couldn't help me at that time but she walked me out and showed me some options. Thank you for that. As promised I came back two days later and new hostess was ok, but once inside at my table their service was INCREDIBLE. They make you feel like royalty. I had different servers picking up my plates and asking how things were going, it seemed like they were working as a team.   I got the butter fish plate with the black rice. A bit to strong taste for me, didn't love it. But salad/dessert absolutely delicious. I'm sure if I got the steak or sushi I would've liked the meal a lot more. Again, know what you are ordering.",

We ordered a combination of rolls and calamari for dinner and an upside down Pineapple cake for desert. Rolls were average. Calamari seemed rubbery and tough. I could not eat the Calamari. The Pineapple upside down cake had a burned smell when it came to the table, half of the bottom was burned. We ate around the burned parts. The waiter offered to take it off our bill, but why did it even come out? We told him we ate around it and didn't feel right about taking it off the bill. Not worth returning to Roys  unless it's for drinks. The bar is probably a safe bet. The waiter was fine. The person bussing our table started reaching across  the table to take away our plates in a rather abrupt manner. He appeared out of nowhere, the second we put our chopsticks down. Without asking, he leaned across both of settings and started stacking our plates. It was like we were being rushed out of there. We spent about $100 with tip. Not worth it.",

He paced the meal very well and was attentive, yet not overwhelmingly so alike some waiters.

Then I had the grilled Caesar salad. I really like that the salad wasn't drowning in dressing like lots of restaurants often do.   My entree was seared ahi with rice. It was a perfect seat on he outside, yet tender and rare on the inside. The sticky rice was great as well.

    "text": "Definitely had my hopes set high for the price points on the menu and decor.  Made a reservation, arrived early by a few minutes,  and still was asked by three different people my name and if I had a reservation.  To top. It off they all were within three steps of each other,  led to a table by a girl with blonde hair that needed to be brushed.    Ordered appetizers, entrees, dessert. The summer sangria was awesome, really nice drink, well mixed.  Appetizers came out, decent presentation but NO PLATES .....glazed ribs too messy to eat over myself or the cloth table cover. Just was awkward trying to eat until finally flagged someone down.   Hand cut sirloin with corn/chile mash potatoes. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was cooked, nicely seasoned.... Mash was a nice bold flavor contrast.   Teppanyaki shrimp.... BLAH.  Shrimp were 30-40 size and tasted and looked like they came out of a bag of imported frozen shrimp from Walmart. Bland and severely disappointing. Fried rice was mushy and bland again, like a Bird's Eye microwave bag of rice and vegetables.   Dessert.... Molten chocolate lava cake with ice cream and raspberry cheese cake.... Might serve the same thing at Red Robin.   I would have hoped for an island dessert, something more related to the \"Hawaiian\" menu.   Doubt will ever go back.  I think some may think I'm crass but for $100 for two people it should have been somewhat a special experience.",

Had large pieces of bok choy that were good, but semi difficult to eat because it was just like a whole half chunk of bok choy all together. Also had a fancy little carrot that was still super crunchy and ginger rice that was tasty, but a little cold...  Also tried a couple pieces of the ribeye. Very flavorful! And macadamian but crusted mahi mahi, which was good but not as flavorful as my dish or the ribeye.   Wait staff is typically great, but today's girl never smiled. Wasnt friendly. Just took our order. Did her thing.",

The steak had this super salty sauce we didn't ask for. Sent it back and the scraped it off and gave us the same steak. The halibut tasted like leather. Both were over 50-bucks. I would rather drive to Scottsdale and get a real steak or fish for a much cheaper price. Realistically you can go to out back and get the same steak.   Very very disappointed.",

    "text": "We made a reservation through Open Table to celebrate our Anniversary, we wrote on the reservation the motive of our visit...our table was the only one without light candle, the waiter \"noticed\" maybe 20 minutes after we arrived and just \"drop it\" inside of the candle like a coin. Not carefully not attentive, didn't placed the candle on the Center for us or at least smiled..nothing...   I think I'm used to be greeted better? By the hostess and the waiters? Specially at this kind of restaurants where yo pay $60-70 per person right? And well I was expecting at least more friendly and attentive service.  The ambience is just ok, nothing fancy, and dark, very dark I hate how the pictures from the food came out...  Also I can tell the place must be old and they haven't invest in renovations for a while... the ceiling had some problems with the rain or the a/c I wasn't able to tell but there was a hole on the ceiling and the paint was coming off... one of the plates that I got was really scratched and still being used..I mean I will not complain if this is a Hole in the Wall cheap kind a restaurant...but we are paying right?  The music was annoying, very repetitive and the rhythm was accelerated like music that you hear at a fast food place... I don't know I was expecting a more relaxed and soft kind of music... We visited on a Sunday, arrived at 4:30 by 5:00 the place started to get more costumers and became noisy...so keep that in mind. Besides that the kitchen is on a corner and they don't have doors which makes you listen all the noise of the cooking and the handling of the plates...yeah my romantic dinner was romantic because of my husband, that's it the environment didn't help it to make it a perfect celebration how I expected.  The food was salty and I wish they added more vegetables   I'm really disappointed, when we married in Koo Olina our celebration was at Roy's Restaurant and everything was perfect,the food, the service...so celebrating our Wedding Anniversary on this other Roy's made sense to us... However I really regret to try to celebrate on this restaurant my anniversary",

    "text": "Fine but not consistent with other locations. I've eaten at several Roy's, not probably in 5 years, but took my girls here for their first time for valentines and was definitely disappointed. The server was very nice and i don't fault him, but the kitchen definitely messed up this evening. Prix Fixe menu should make it easier to get people in/out with good food, but that was the opposite. The apps were good, but the next dish of soup and salad took forever. This is not the dish that should take a long time. Salad was the same temp as the soup, why wasn't the Caesar chilled and just waiting to add dressing? For the price I expect something other than bland non-seasoned white bread for croutons. Just seemed weird for a nice restaurant. The main dish was ok, wife's was amazing, mine which was the most expensive option was mediocre at best. The desert was ok, except the red velvet cake which taste worse than store bought. Cake was not soft and moist and very average frosting. Not what I expected when you say you have a master pastry chef. Small detail, but still frustrating, nice restaurants need to taste their water. When you serve water and don't ask if you'd like bottle or filtered than I expect the water to not have a bad after taste. This is an easy fix and overlooked. It took about 2 hours for dinner, about 15 min was our fault, but not worth the wait.  Last night I spent the same money for 3 people at another restaurant. We had more food, more drinks, and everyone loved their dining experience and couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. Had I known how far Roy's had fallen I would have taken my family to the place I went last night instead to ensure they had a special evening.",

With the discount I felt I could try a bit more and started my meal with an appetizer. I had the Ahi Poke, similar to a caviche small cubes of ahi came in a martini glass seasoned with some soy and garnished with a wasabi mayo. It was good but quite small.   For my meal I selected the \"Roy's classic trio\" consisting of Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi & Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. It came out with 3 small I mean small plates in a tasting style display. The Ahi was great, the spices went well with the cool raw interior. The Butter fish was nice too with a sweet miso glaze on a bed (or pillow in this case) of black rice. I thought the salmon was a bit over cooked. After I had finished the three 2oz tastings I was still hungry.   I am probably not the only one with this opinion as on both weekday visits we were one of two tables.   I think if they want to increase the plate count they should lower the prices and or up the portion size.",

    "text": "my first-ever experience at one of roy yamaguchi's restaurants was on my tiny little island in the middle of the pacific ocean. poipu, kauai, hawaii to be exact. and since my fist experience, roy's restaurants never fail to amaze me.  this was a special occasion because it happened to be my birthday!! my husband and i decided to do something special and spend the weekend away from tucson and drive up to the phoenix area. i was excited to find a local favorite of mine from back home up here on the mainland.   i made my special birthday dinner reservation and was even excited that they answered the phone with a friendly 'aloha'.  as expected, we were seated at a nice, intimate table. the one thing i love about roy's is how personalized he makes your experience. because they knew i was coming in for my birthday dinner, they made a nice little insert for the menus brought to our table. when we were done ordering, they rolled the inserts up and gave them to us to have as keepsakes.   our server was gracious and kind the entire evening.  the husband had a combination of two types of seafood -- fish and scallops (that were hugeeeee!!) and i got the filet mignon. everything was cooked to perfection. of course we had to get the chocolate souffle for desert. you can't ever go to roy's and not get chocolate souffle. it should be against the law. it has to be the best desert on the face of the earth [in my humble opinion]. to top that off, they even brought out their signature flourless chocolate complete with candle and our server took our picture and framed it to also take home.  we both left fat & happy. if i could have it my way, i'd choose roy's restaurant for every special occasion we celebrate because the people that work for roy always go above and beyond to make sure everything is perfect.   mahalo nui loa a hui hou, roy's chandler! hope to see you soon!",

The appetizers were fine, too. I recommend the sliders and the rolls.   So why three stars? Because for a happy hour, it was all just meh. The food was fine, but not outstanding or particularly filling. The cocktails were fine, IMO, but others at our table found them too sweet. Very limited beer selection, too.  Looking at the regular menu, there's no way I could swing those prices for the plates I saw people receiving. I hear the chocolate souffle, though, is definitely worth it.",

The spicy butter sauce was more spicy than expected (horseradish type of spiciness) and the flavor wasn't that great anyways.  For desert I had the chocolate dish that takes 20 minutes to make (they tell you in advance, so that's not a problem) which was actually pretty good.  For the price the place is not worth it.

    "text": "Tried Roy's for the first time last night when we met some friends who rave about their Aloha Hour (Happy Hour).  Always avoided going because we tend to not like restaurant chains, but this place is a gem and exceeded our expectations.  The bar area is relatively small, but very classy.  We were able to have few drinks at the bar ($5 for beer, wine, and their signature cocktails) before we were able to get a table in the bar area for 5 people...thanks to Leah and the hostess staff (you guys are great).  Didn't have a bad drink -- loved the The Original Hawaiian martini was delish, as was the mojito, jalapeno margarita, mai tai, and wine.  A friend was sad the cucumber drink she liked was missing from the menu, but sounds like the menu changes often so diners/drinkers get a chance to try new concoctions throughout the year.    For food, we tried most of the HH specials.  Everything was spot on -- excellent flavors and beautifully presented.  The tuna roll and tempura shrimp rolls were my favorites (sushi rolls), with the lobster pot-stickers being a close second.  Some friends ordered dinner...and were able to speak with Chef Bray about his recommendations for fish.  She ended up getting the Crab Dynamite Baked Barramundi, which was so yummy!  The happy rice on the side was great too.   My hubby got the Yellow Fin Ahi Poke -- something we have looked for since trying some fresh poke in Kona, HI last year.  I couldn't believe the flavors...eating poke in the AZ desert!  Its preparation with the Wasabi Creme Fraiche made it a meal we will seek out again in the near future.  Ended our meal by sharing the chocolate souffle, which was a perfect ending to a great Friday night gathering.    Definitely recommend Roy's for seafood that is excellently prepared.  Aloha Hour is a must.  Extra props to Matt, our waiter, and Leah on the hostess team for their accommodations and service.  We had a great night.",

Two bites into my husband and I's meal ( we both got the Butterfish ) and we see charcoal all over the bottom underneath our fish.

I also ordered a jalapeno margarita & they always come with the jalapeno garnish instead, this one came without. My favorite part is the jalapeno.  All in all they came & took $20 off our bill.

The calamari was great. My wife liked the salmon and I was really pleased with the special, dynamite baramundi. No kidding it was the best dish I can recall eating! The service was perfect, very attentive and friendly. Most definitely we will return and recommend to friends. Way to go!",

    "text": "As I promised, I am updating my review of Roy's.  I went there last night and there was a great improvement over my previous visit.  We were seated promptly as the restaurant was about half full.  A waitress came over fairly quickly to take our drink orders.  We both had their \"Celebrate Fall\" special, consisting of an appetizer of breaded prawns on a bed of cabbage leaves and a great salsa.  Really delicious.  The crusted salmon was done according to order, i.e., well done for me and medium for my wife.  It was served on a bed of baby vegetables and was quite yummy, no complaints there.  I also ordered a wedge salad as my wife and I were both extremely hungry, pretty much having not eaten lunch.  The bread pudding for dessert was nothing short of outstanding, served with a garnish of fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream.  So, all in all, the food was really good.  So if the food was this good, why the three stars.  Well, for me to give 5 stars I would have to visit a restaurant several times and have a predominantly 5 star experience each time, so I'm no quite there with Roy's yet.  As I pointed out in previous reviews the food and service seems to be spotty, so I'll have to keep an open mind and return a few times to see if their game has truly been upped or if last night was a fluke.  Sorry to be so pessimistic, but my experience has made me very wary, considering that Roy's is not bottom of the barrel pricewise.  Four stars might have been appropriate, but there were a couple of missteps.    To start with, for some reason Roy's is a bit slow on the drinks front, which is odd as most restaurants make a large portion of their profit from the sale of alcohol.  That should prompt the bartenders and waiting staff to get those first drinks out ASAP.  Also, because we were so hungry I asked if we could order some bread.  The waitress told me they don't offer bread, but we could have some complimentary edamame if we wished.  I gladly accepted the offer, but the edamame never materialized.  I was also never asked if I wanted another beer - same comment about alcohol sales.  I don't get it.  (As an aside, Roy's has no beer on draught, just bottles, but I shall not hold that against them in the review.  Again, beer on tap may carry a higher margin than the bottled variety, so why not sell it that way?  I'll let you decide if this is a plus or a minus.  I do find it odd, though, since most good restaurants do offer tap beer and in larger quantities than a 12 oz. bottle provides.)  Lastly, I waited a full 15 minutes to get my bill.  I was basically ignored by the waitress and had to get another staffer to lasso her and get my bill ready.  Oh, yes, during our meal, a gentleman, who I assume to be the manager, did come to our, and everyone else's, table very briefly to inquire as to the quality of our experience.  I don't mean to be rude or mean, but his approach was more perfunctory than warm or cordial, but at least he made the rounds.  All in all I enjoyed the experience, but since 5 stars are out for the moment and since there were still a few hiccups with service, the best I can do at the moment is 3 stars.  I shall go back since the food was so good last night and the service has improved, but still not as good as it should be.   I would love to give this shop 5 stars, so I'll give them a chance to earn it.",

A menu full of unique Hawaiian inspired cocktails to choose from and wine and beer all for $5.  Six different, all delicious, $5 appetizers to choose from including lobster pot stickers, sliders w/sweet potato fries, beef skewers, ahi tuna roll, salt and pepper calamari, and one more lobster one . . . I forget.  The calamari and sliders w/fries were my favorite.  This is a great place to go when you want a good happy hour, but aren't looking for the crowded, busy spots.  This was a great place to eat, drink, and catch up on conversation.    While we were lingering around waiting for our friends and after finishing our food, our server was great about checking in, but not too much.  Making sure we didn't miss happy hour, but not pressuring us either.  Never felt rushed or that we were putting her out by trying to get one more appetizer in just under the wire.  And the drinks were great!  Normally, the fruity drinks don't appeal to me.  But with names like Basil Cucumber Collins, or Cilantro Cucumber Margarita, Pineapple Ginger Mojito, Lemongrass Sake-tini, (the list goes on and on) I couldn't resist.  AND, the wine was great, had a glass of the Malbec.  BF liked his beer.  Oh, and all of this Aloha goodness . . . DAILY . . . 4:30-6:30!  Nice!  Mahalo, Roy's!  We will be back!",

He said ok, took my number and said he would call me back. No phone call, received a text message from him showing the bill was corrected from $160 to $106.10. Wasn't happy. My husband called Roys and asked for the GM, was told we do not have anyone here by that name! Seriously! Then asked for the General Manager and spoke with Jay.

    "text": "So we just finished dinner at Roy's for Restaurant Week and I must say it was quite impressive.  We're not accustomed to eating out so 'finely' on a week night, but this has been a rough week for dear hubby of mine and I wanted to treat him tonight.  We showed up a bit early before our reservation, so we sat at the bar and were tended by a couple of lovely gals.  I had a very delish grapefruit martini and he a Jameson... then we were taken to our table and commenced the 'feeding process'.  WOW, it's been over an hour since we ate and I'm still 'stuffed to the brim'!  Their portions were very impressive:  Appetizer: I had the Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Roll appetizer, he hadthe Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs - consensus: roll was outstanding, accompanied by a fantastic buttery miso; ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor coating was finger-licking yumminess.  Main Course: I had the Mac Nut Mahi Mahi and he had the Beef Short Ribs.. again, flavorful!  Mahi Mahi is a little too dry for me (it was cooked more rare, which should have helped this already dry meat) and besides the Lobster essence, there wasn't that much excitement going on.. no spark, no za-zamm...(BTW, HUGE portion on the Mahi Mahi).. his short ribs were scrumptious, especially with that braising sauce to smear it with... his dish was way better than my dish. Dessert:  We tried both the Souffle and Cheesecake.. the cheesecake BY FAR outdid the Souffle.  The Souffle was just too rich and too chocolatey... unbearably so!  but the cheesecake was creamy, slightly rich but well balanced with the fats in the crumb base... ugh, so good!  Overall we enjoyed it!  Service was great and I appreciated that Roy's participated in Restaurant Week and had such impressive dishes and delivered on all ends (well, except as noted).",

    "text": "It is a rare restaurant that doesn't misstep at all, and this is definitely one.  I was doing a sales type dinner, so I looked on Yelp for a good restaurant - Roy's popped up - just around the corner from the office and rated highly.  Without knowing anything, the plan was laid.  The dinner started with edemame - nicely steamed (but a little over-cooked in my opinion - still very good), covered in a mix of salt and sweet - brown sugar, perhaps?  Definitely delicious.  Then we ordered the Roys Canoe Appetizer and a Lobster California Roll.  I highly recommend the Szechuan Pork Ribs off the Canoe, but everything was excellent.  The ribs got more than one complement.  Our main courses were mostly from the sea.  I had the chicken breast of the night which came with bacon gravy and sweet potato puree.  The sweet potato puree was sweet, but the bacon gravy more than made up for it.  I mean, honestly, how can you go wrong with bacon gravy?  The other main courses all got good reviews.  On to dessert and coffee.  One of my dining companions opted for the pineapple upside down cake, and the other for pumpkin cheesecake.  When they came out, they were works of art - comments like \"it's a shame to eat it\", but they managed it anyway, and commented on how delicious they were.  The cappuchinos around the table were also savored.  Through it all, we had some of the best service I have encountered.  It wasn't obtrusive, but there was always someone close by to assist.  My only complaint (and its common among a lot of restaurants) is that when asked for a recommendation, waitstaff always point to the most expensive thing on the menu.  Either that or they go the marginally less informative route of saying 'well, everything is good'.  Seriously guys - you need to step up and say what YOU like.",

Roy's is a place I go on a night I'm looking to celebrate something and enjoy a nice time with friends or family.",

My husband thought it was a little pricey, but I think three people who were drinking, ordered an appetizer and had three entrees for just a little over $200 was pretty reasonable.  Especially given the unique entres and the amazing service.  I had the white truffle and black pepper scallops and they were amazing.  The pesto rice stuff they were on was sooooooo good.  Had to try the chocolate soufle after reading all the reviews on here and it was yummy, but by that time I was EXTREMELY full!  We'd do it again anytime.",

A note was on the table when we got there and the night ended with a group picture, and a small cake. The staff here is amazing and would be the reason why I'd come here again, and have. I ordered the Dynamite lump crab crusted barramundi. The fist was done right, I enjoyed the taste and the sides of bok choy and the carrot. One thing I wanted to highlight was the sauce, while it was tasty, there was way to much of it, that it overpowered the taste of the fish. I would have loved it more if there was less sauce.   Thanks again to everyone there our experience was amazing. Definitely will be back.",

Compared to the other Roy's we've gone to in North Scottsdale, California and Hawaii, this location wasn't a standout but the quality and service was still great.   I always get the Aloha roll sushi appetizer and they were out of spicy tuna so they ended up subbing it for salmon inside which I loved even more than the original :)  I always get the Misoyaki Butterfish and thought my portion was a bit teensier than usual...but maybe the other Roy's just serve bigger portions.   We will be back (pro-tip: the Costco in Chandler sells $100 Roy's gift cards for $70, so pick some up to get $30 off)!",

My friends and I (4 of us), wanted to get dressed up and have a really nice dinner. We debated for days between Hillstone and Roy's.  I love Hillstone too but we wanted more of a variety so we went with Roy's.   Between the 4 of us, we ordered and shared the following: Wedge Salad Calamari Lobster Pot stickers Classic Four  Duck Breast  Roy's Trip Truffle Bacon Mac n Cheese Lobster Fried Rice  2 bottles of wine.

While we enjoy the ambiance and menu, the service at this location is almost always a disappointment and the food can be hit or miss. About every third time the fish is dry, overcooked. Last night was the biggest disappointment to date. We waited 25 minutes before calling a server over to please take our drink order, he forgot them and came back 5 minutes later to take them again. He then proceeded to not bring a correct drink. He continually reached all the way across table to set things down, pick them up, he served from one spot instead of walking around. He interrupted my husband and friend to chime into their conversation. While we understand everyone is new sometime, this is not our first time with a less-than professional server. It happens a lot here. For the price we pay here we should be receiving good to excellent service. We will not be frequenting Roy's in Chandler in the future.",

It also came with forbidden rice which was super hard. I then ordered the lump crab fried rice which I was so excited about. The rice was hard. My friend had the salmon which she said was good but her side of rice was also hard and she couldn't eat it. The lobster pot stickers were good and did not disappoint.

He said it was the most of any restaurant he's been too that's not a vegan specific restaurant. The best part for him was when they said could adapt any of the vegetarian dishes to be completely vegan. The meal he had was, as he put it \"the best I've had since turning vegan 2 years ago\". He loved it and was excited when I told him there was a Roy's in So-Cal near where he lived.   I personally had the Roys trio...the portion size was perfect for a \"sampler\" meal. But the flavors were out of this world. Man was It great. Service was excellent and the entire meal was very enjoyable. Even the drinks were a strong pour and very good. I'll be back often.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try out Roy's for a while now, and finally got around to stopping in this past Friday...  We rolled in a little after 9ish, and business was quite slow at this time ... I believe there might have been a few people in the bar area and only another two top in the dining room area.  Needless to say we were seated fairly promptly and the hostess seemed pleasant.  A server greeted us promptly, and since neither of us had been here before and there was a rather extensive menu it took us a few minutes to ask the waiter questions and review our possible menu choices.  I opted to try a Hawaiin (pineapple) Martini, and my friend had a glass of wine.  I must admit the pineapple Martini was delicious and a very well balanced cocktail.   The server asked us if we would like some complimentary edamame, and I must say I believe they flavored the edamame with some sort of hawaiin spice/flavoring because they tasted quite delicious and different from the typical bland heavily salted edamame.... it was nice.  I decided to try the surf and turf option - filet mignon and lobster tail.  It was very reasonably priced at under $60, and it was very good.  I was actually impressed the lobster was soooo yummy.  My medium filet was nicely flavored hawaiin style and it was accompanied with bearnaise sauce, which is one of my favorite dipping sauces for filet, so I was quite pleased.  I will admit it's not the best lobster tail or piece of filet that I have ever had, so it was not absolutely exceptional, but it was great tasting based on the price and portion size - it hit the spot and the plate presentation was very nice too!! The broccolini was a nice light side.    My friend tried the half chicken dinner and seemed to like it ... However, I did not try it, so I really can't give any sort of extensive review about it.  Overall, I would probably rate Roy's a solid 4.5 star review if that was possible.  We really enjoyed our dinners/adult beverages, the service was very good, the overall ambiance and look of the restaurant was was appealing, and the reasonable price point/portions were spot on!  I would absolutely recommend Roy's to others, and I am sure I'll be back to have another filet/lobster tail dinner with a Hawaiin twist at some point in the future!",

There was an error with my reservation and she was able to take ownership of the issue and fix it appropriately. She was super friendly to talk to and confident in taking care of the issue. This started off such a great experience at Roy's! Upon arriving, I was greeted and happen to to show up earlier than my reservation and was able to be sat right away. Did not get the girls name but she was also very friendly and I felt taken care of. The waiters name, I believe is Tyler. If I am mistaken I apologize. We were sat at 7:15 on Friday the 28th of June, 2019. He was \"three for three\" on recommendations!! He recommended the seasonal halibut and was open and honest about why it was a great choice. It was unbelievable! He then recommended a whiskey drink which I loved and took the time to help me figure out the type of whiskey to go with. Lastly, he recommended the pineapple upside down cake with coconut icecream!! Once again, un-freaking-believable!! Roy's in general is an amazing restaurant and I have been going there for a couple of years. I have always loved their food and this was by far the best experience I've ever had. Tyler (hope I'm right) knows the entire menu and was extremely helpful in making this such an amazing experience. When we asked him what hes tried and what he liked, his response was \"I've had everything.\" He was wearing a \"Kukui Nut\" lei (necklace) which we asked about, and he even educated us about the culture and what he was wearing! We could tell that he loves his job and takes the time to evaluate recommendations based on his own authentic experiences with the food at Roy's. I will be back sooner than later and Roy's will now be a regular visit because of my experience last night. Unbelieveable and thank you Roy's for your UNBELIEVABLE staff and food. -Brett",

They make sure what exactly you want, and always match the expectations. It is not cheap, but I prefer to pay a bit more but not worry about how good it will be. Recommended.",

    "text": "OMG! This place is absolutely WONDERFUL! In celebration of my birthday a group of friends and I went to Roy's. A friend made reservations well in advance and when we arrived we were immediately seated. I opened my menu and to my surprise inside the menu was a flyer that was personalized for all the guest in my party wishing me, yours truly, a happy birthday. It was a nice keepsake. At the end of our meal we were also photographed and given the picture in a nice frame to forever capture the event....Anywho...on to the food.  For an appetizer I enjoyed the lobster roll. It was good. The seafood fresh and the presentation awesome.  My girlfriends had salt and pepper calamari and the other had szechuan baby back ribs (these were heavenly).  Main entrees we enjoyed the misoyaki butterfish and it was succulent, moist and melt in your mouth fabulous. My other friend enjoyed the rack of lamb and judging by the bones left on her plate they must have been pretty darn good as well.   Dessert. I had the pineapple upside down cake and my friends had the apple crisp tart and the molten hot chocolate cake...orgasmic...lol  Oh, I forgot the sangria it was Wonderful as well...  This place is awesome. However, if you are looking for a $20 meal this is not your place. Be prepared to spend a little more than average here. It is worth every penny. Appetizers are roughly between $10 -$20. My dinner entree alone was $28.95 and desserts average what appetizers cost. Bring your credit card...lol   I hear happy hour is wonderful with wonderful prices. I will be returning very, very soon.",

We celebrated a special occasion there and we couldn't have been happier with our choice of a restaurant. It might be just a little bit too loud if you want a quiet romantic dinner but the service and the food make up for it. Everything was delicious, and again, the service was quite impressive! The waiter made us feel like we were his most special customers not just that night, but ever!:) So Roy's will always be our first choice for special occasions.",

FABULOUS service from a Lady who knew exactly how to successfully wait on a small party. As usual, her impeccable service made the experience all the more enjoyable.  I always have a difficult time NOT having The Butter Fish dish. It had been voted as one of the Top Ten Dishes in Las Vegas when I lived there a couple of years ago and, although I have never eaten Butterfish anywhere else - OUT OF THIS WORLD!  On this particular visit, our party had a couple of Appetizers (Pot Stickers, Sea Scallops) and two salads (Chopped, Maui Wowie Shrimp) as well as the aforementioned Butterfish entree our other entrees included, Salmon and both of the available Mahi Mahi dishes.  EVERYTHING was prepared superbly and I can honestly say, that outside of Legal's (East Coast) Roy's does fish better than any other Chain, and better than most Independents specializing in fish.  A great treat every visit and this past one was as good if not better thanany!    Can't miss here.",

    "text": "My wife and I have wanted to try Roy's since we moved to Ahwatukee. We're glad we finally made it there because the food was absolutely wonderful.  We called ahead for a reservation and were seated right on time. Our server was very prompt, and took a moment to go over the menu since we were \"first timers\". We started with the lobster potstickers. They were fantastic. Substantial lobster filling and light enough to leave room for our entrees. I was struggling with what to order so our server told us the chef could do a split plate with two entrees. It was the perfect solution, and very unique compared to other restaurants.   I had the blackened ahi and the prosciutto wrapped ono. Both were perfectly cooked. The ahi was spicier than I had anticipated, but very flavorful with great texture. The Ono was the better of the two dishes. Light with a great buttery flavor, and the prosciutto didn't overpower the flavor of the fish. My wife had the scallops. There were four large diver scallops in the order. The had a wonderful crispy sear, but were perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was very savory as well with great flavor.   We finished with the chocolate souffle. it was very light, but rich at the same time. Word to the wise, pre order this if you're thinking about it for dessert. Ours came about 10 minutes after we finished our entrees because we pre ordered. A couple next to us didn't, and they were waiting for theirs even though they finished their entrees before we did.   Overall a great experience and we'll definitely go back. We'd love to make it in time for the happy hour and try some of the appetizer and cocktail specials.",

    "text": "I'm really torn about this one, so let's start here. That was literally the worst piece of fish that I have ever been served. Last year I was in Honolulu for my birthday and my wife and I had an amazing dinner at Roy's. When my wife found a Roy's here in Arizona, she thought that it would be a nice surprise for my birthday this year. We were greeted and promptly sat at a table that had a place card wishing me a happy birthday (very nice touch.) We ordered drinks and ordered. I had tuna poke and my wife had lobster dumplings. Both were fantastic and got my hopes up for the entree. My wife had a filet and I ordered the macadamia nut mahi mahi. My wife's filet was spot on although the whipped potatoes and veg were pedestrian. My mahi on the other hand was terrible. I know, I live hundreds of miles from fresh fish but still. The mahi was cooked until every molecule of water was cooked out. Not only did the fish not flake, it turned into dust (that might be a slight exaggeration but still, it was dry as this god forsaken desert that I live in.) The complimentary birthday dessert was a nice touch and the flourless chocolate cake was great.  Service was good but I'm not sure that it was $75 per person good (no steak knife until my wife had finished and my wife's dessert was served 15 minutes after mine.) I would have to say that my night would have been better at the bar just eating appetizers and dessert.",

Great place to go for a nice evening out !   Attire is semi dressy and the meats are always perfectly prepared! Although they do offer a lot of seafood and sushi we opt for the Steaks and meats!  Although friends of ours rave about the seafood their so I bet it's a great meal as well !   Our waitress on the other hand was just okay !  As it got busier she seemed to stop by less and less I had an empty glass sitting in front of me for some time ! That's one thing that drives me nuts . Just fill my glass before its empty especially if it's just a simple glass of soda ! I would have tipped her a lot more then I did if she didn't have a waiter in trading or what seemed to be the buss boy offer us dessert and such ! So besides her dropping the ball a little bit with consistent waitressing it was all wonderful and worth every penny !  Thank you for a wonderful night out !!!",

    "text": "Really disappointed - had a mediocre experience here.  First time here, came with my friend for restaurant week in September. We came on a Thursday night around 7:30 - mostly empty restaurant. The hostess was really sweet. The place itself is clean, and the decor is nice.  We were especially disappointed in the server. He seemed overwhelmed, even though there were plenty of other servers there; he was overall inattentive. This seemed especially prominent once he realized we were doing restaurant week - maybe he didn't think he would get the same kind of tip as a table ordering off the regular menu? Not sure. At one point, a second server even came over to \"help out\", but was equally rushed and didn't really seem to help much. Our server also disappeared for long stretches, especially when we were ready for the check, and came back smelling like smoke. It would have been okay if we could have flagged someone else down - there were plenty of servers standing around - but we weren't able to and had to wait 15-20 minutes just for the check!  I really could have forgiven the poor service if the food had been good, but it was just average. Best things we had: - Lobster potstickers - amazing, very good! - Grilled salmon - pretty good, nothing outstanding but a solid dish  Everything else was just \"meh\", including: - Teppanyaki Shrimp ... not good, bland, mushy fried rice - Grilled ceasar salad - Desserts - the choclate dessert and the raspberry cheesecake, both just fine, nothing special.  Overall, for a $100 meal, I would have expected much better - at least on either the service end or the food end. Both could use some improvement. No wonder the place wasn't busy.",

The hostess acted like she was doing us a favor.  She made us wait 15 minutes for them to \"set up a table\". Our server was very good, and dinner was nice but the portions...wayyyyy too small.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a BIG eater by an case, but it seemed as they only served a \"taste\" of food. They did leave me wanting more with the salmon but for the most part it was disappointing.  I have to give them credit for having the Hawaiian brew which is very tasty if you give it a shot.  KONA BREWING CO.",

    "text": "My husband asks me to travel with him, often.  99% of the time, I just can't get away.  However, when he told me that he was going to Scottsdale AND that there's a Roy there, I asked him to book my ticket immediately and I would clear my schedule!!  We live in Charlotte, NC and the closed Roy's is 6.5 hours away!  Shameful!  Let me preface the 4 star rating by saying that it really should be 4.5 stars, but that's not an option (Hello, Yelp...get with the .5 star ratings already!).  I really wanted it to be a \"5\" experience, but it didn't quite live up to the 5 star stellar perfection of the experience that we had at Roy's in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii.  If the Miso Butterfish (one of Roy's Signature dishes on the menu at all of their locations) was prepared exactly as it was in Waikiki, then I would have given 5 stars, no problem!  Everything else about this visit was spot-on, but the difference in the fish had to take it down to 4 stars.    We arrived early for our reservation so we waited at the bar and enjoyed delicious drinks and an appetizer from the Happy Hour Menu until our table was ready.  My husband had the Mango Mojito and I had the Hawaiian Martini.  Both of them were strong and delicious.  The Hawaiian Martini was my favorite drink of the week!  I ordered the Happy Hour Tempura Crusted Spicy Ahi Tuna Roll.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  Easily, the most delicious thing I ate all week....and I ate some really good food in AZ that week!!!  The Bartender was new to that location so he was still learning the ropes.  He was SO nice, very friendly, and very attentive.  He's going to do great there!  Our table opened up just as we finished our appetizer.  We were seated at a nice table that had great view of the dining room.   My husband ordered the Bing Cherry stuffed Pork Tenderloin.  It was beautifully plated, seasoned perfectly, and was moist and delicious.  He was very pleased.  The Apple & Goat Cheese Potatoes Au Gratin were also excellent.  As mentioned earlier in my post, I ordered the Miso Butterfish.  It was very good, but it wasn't the sublime dish that I had in Waikiki Beach.  The flavors were only marginally different, but enough to make a difference.  We ordered the Kona Coffee Creme Brulee for dessert, but it was a bit too strong tasting for my liking.  Service was excellent, attentive, and timely.  The restaurant is very pretty and the overall ambiance is inviting and upscale, but still comfortable and not stuffy.  It was a great meal and a lovely dining experience.  I would definitely go back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone.",

We had to take advantage as an excuse to go back and as usual we were not disappointed.  I love their food and their to die for chocolate lava cake.  I could just go for the cake any day of the week!!!   We ordered something different other than steak or seafood.  I tried the bone in pork chop and wow, it was simply dreamy.  I took half of it home because I had filled up with the rib appetizer.  I would say five it a try if you haven't been here and if you have, come back.  It saves us a trip from going back to Hawaii for this food (not that I would mind going back to Hawaii, but love this place as it is a treat).",

They used to have several options on a seasonal prefix menu. Now they just have one.  They also took the beef short ribs egg rolls off the menu. It was rich but so tasty. The portions have gotten smaller and seems to be more expensive. I noticed they are now offering sides? So it has a different feel for it. Then to top it off, a lot of new employees. the atmosphere just isn't the same either. It sounds like the bar has taken over the resturant because it was just so loud in the dining room area. Luckily thr chocolate souffle was still incredible. But I'm afraid I'm not going to be running back. So sad.",

Matthew is extraordinary at the bar! He is very friendly, super-attentive, knowledgeable and generous. I recommend dining at the bar if you have the option.  Next, the decor is very pleasing. Though the locations I've been to on the Islands (Kauai and Ko'Olina) are wonderful just because it is Hawaii afterall, the design of this location is more aesthetically pleasing and intimate. I've dined here a total of three times now - twice in the bar and once in the restaurant and I find it very enjoyable.  Finally, the food is consistent with all other Roy's locations, which is very good. Tonight I enjoyed the potstickers and had just an \"okay\" experience with the seasonal salad only because I didn't inquire about the dressing (didn't pair well with my wine). Matthew was kind enough to bring me something to clear my palate afterwards so I could enjoy the remainder of my wine. From my recollection of the other two visits, I remember the food to be quite enjoyable (I believe I had the butterfish at least once and maybe even twice).  When in Chandler, Roy's definitely ranks highly in my book. I almost went somewhere else to expand my experience when in the area, though am glad I didn't.   I've dined at several other Roy's just for context: Kauai, Ko'Olina, San Francisco, and Carmel and this is one of the nicest. Who knows, I may be visiting the Ko'Olina location again in just over a week...",

We ordered the potstickers--overcooked and too crunchy on edges.  The waiter recommended the calamari--it came in a very sour sauce that was not good.  I wish they had served the calamari with a side for dipping.  Having lived in HI, I know Poke and I have never seen it served with green tomatoes and odd sauce--nothing close to authentic.  Butterfish and short rib dinners were both covered with the same tomato and onion topping--very strange.  My wife did not receive a birthday dessert.

The lobster roll was good and fresh, but it was difficult to taste the lobster. The calamari was great, but the sauce was far too spicy for our tastes.  They had a special birthday message in the menu as well as chocolate bday wish on a small dessert plate of cookies and a picture of the two of us to commemorate the special occasion.  My Mahi was very good, although slightly dry. The husband's shellfish sampler was superb. The chocolate souffle was delicious! The restaurant made it a very special dinner.",

I made a reservation online and the online form asked if there was a special occasion, so I entered that it was my birthday and it asked for my name... when we got to the restaurant they had personalized the menu's with a welcome and happy birthday page which was beautiful and a really nice surprise.  Each of us (me, my husband and two teenagers) had something different and everything was delicious.  They also brought a complimentary birthday dessert as well as took a group photo and delivered it to us in a frame.  The birthday desserts as well as the chocolate lava cake and the pineapple upside down cake were a perfect way to complete a wonderful evening.  I really would recommend Roy's for any special occasion.",

Wow this place was really good... handled a large group with ease and the appetizers, food and drinks were all amazing.  I had their special which was four smaller servings of their butterfish, mahi mahi, salmon and seared ahi tuna.  I enjoyed this a lot, but the ahi tuna did not have a lot of flavor and others at the table who had the same thing agreed.  I also had a mango mojito that was perfect!  I did try a couple of bites of one of their signature deserts... it was a flourless chocolate cake with a creamy chocolate center and a hint of raspberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream it was soooo good!  If I am ever missing the wonderful fish that Hawaii has to offer I am heading straight back to Roy's it was really delicious.",

    "text": "This had been one of my favorite local restaurants. I will give it another chance, but at these prices it better be that \"one bad meal\"- or I'm done paying 100.00 for dinner here.  Decided to splurge for my birthday, so made a reservation for Sat night. Party of 1.   Waiter was good enough, nice guy. He did give me a good recommendation on wine for my second glass. I was happy with him overall.   Their \"signature dish\" Misoyaki Butterfish\" is one I have loved - and ordered every third time I came- for probably 20 years now.   I ordered lobster pot stickers, and they were very overcooked; slightly burned around the edges and slightly tough to chew. This is NOT how pot stickers are supposed to be- and I've loved them previously. (See photo)   Not wanting to start my birthday dinner off negatively, I just ate them and moved on- waiting for the yummy butterfish to come!   The thing about the butterfish has been the delicious Wasabi sauce- slight heat, and slight sweet- that yummy wasabi flavor.   When it came the presentation was a 10! ( see photo) . Was very impressed. My first bite though, was fishy tasting. What? I've NEVER had that happen. Looking at the bottom of that half of the fillet, I could see that dark grey color- which always means a fishy taste. I moved to the other side of the fillet (thankfully the larger side) and had no taste of fishy. Whew!  The other thing is- NO wasabi flavor at all! Just very very sweet. I had loved it BECAUSE of that wasabi kick. WTF?   I did mention this issue  to the waiter when he came by and asked me how it was, and he DID offer right away to replace the fillet, but I decided I would just eat the good part (which was most of it) and again, not have an issue on my birthday dinner.   By now though, I was not happy I had paid $13.00 for hard potstickers and I think it was $42.00 for the butterfish. That's a hefty price for an average size piece of fish- anywhere you eat!  The waiter was sweet to pre order the volcano lava cake for me for birthday dessert (free), and it was perfection- as it had always been. He did then tell me he had taken off the charge for the appetizer due to the butterfish issue. That was decent I felt.   With tip ( generous) it was still 130.00! (2 glasses of wine included)  I think I hit a bad night- the chef/ staff was certainly off.   I will come back- but I will NEVER again order the butterfish. The sauce change alone gives me reason to avoid it.   One more \"fair\" $130.00 dinner and I won't be back again.  I hope that doesn't happen. ************ UPDATE!!! Just ran across another review from late 2017 that complained the butterfish was gray and fishy on the bottom. I don't feel like I'm being overly picky now! Whew!",

I'm not a big drinker, but there are a lot of drink specials too.  I like to sit at the bar because the bartenders are friendly and social.

I wish they offered a lunch menu but everything we had was delicious. We started with the sampler appetizer (I forgot the name) and it was amazing. My husband had the braised short ribs and I had the lobster bisque. Oh my word, it was all heavenly. My girls just had the keiki breakfast and it was breakfast. It's not always that we go all out for lunch but when we do, we'll make sure to go big with Roys. I'm already dreaming about the braised ribs (of course I took a bite).",

But the salmon was undercooked on our current visit, even though the server mentioned it would be medium with the fish cooked completely through. We specifically asked that nothing remained raw. After eating part of the fish, both salmon dishes turned out to be raw inside. The server apologized and had the kitchen cook the dishes again while we waited. They were fine this time, but the chef who we were told would come out to check never came. And the service was listless and slow, even though they were only about half full. We have had much better service here on our past visits. Given the upscale ambience and menu prices, the lackadaisical service was especially grating.",

They first had some appetizers: thai skewers and wagyu dumplings. The skewers were really tender and had a great sauce to it. The dumpling wasn't exactly \"wagyu\" grade, but the flavor was there and the fry was good on the dumplings. The salad that came out while it tasted great, felt very small (like literally I could count the number of leaves they gave me) which was mentioned by several of my coworkers. The main dish that I chose was the braised short ribs which were incredibly tender and juicy. The glaze that was on the outside was delicious as well. I think the highlight was the bed of soft mashed potatoes underneath. The combination was really great and gave a great textural feel. Lastly, the dessert was a chocolate torte that tasted like a REALLY good fudge brownie. Overall, if you're looking for a restaurant to try out Roy's would be good. I think in the future I might try to visit them outside of a set corporate event.",

We waited for about fifteen minutes for our waitress to come over, and when she did it was to take a quick drink order and rushed off. We had to flag her down again to order our dinner, which was probably about twenty minutes after that.   We sat many times with empty drinks, and as the restaurant began to clear out we thought the service would improve. We were sorely mistaken. The icing on the cake was when she never came back to see if anyone else wanted a dessert (one person at our table ordered the pineapple upside down cake which takes longer to cook so it is ordered with dinner), and when she delivered the dessert she asked if anyone else wanted one. Really?   It was such a disappointing dining experience, and sadly we will probably not go back. Pricey and poor service is not a good combination.",

We really liked the lobster dumplings, the lobster bisque, and more poke...   I really liked the butterfish, but it was almost too saucy. We also loved the chocolate souffle!   Service was great! We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Nice decor, great wines and friendly college worker service.  Would be 5 stars if was local joint with small local flair but it's not. It is a very expensive unit of famous Roys of Hawaii where they sell the fresh product, prepared correctly, and executed in the kitchen so that when he hits the table it looks like a $40-$50 meal.   Again if the prices were $25 range then back to probably 3 1/2 stars. But then add the young kids in the corporate uniforms and it just falls apart. I keep thinking wow we're looking at $50-80 person for a corporate meal and there's no value to this. If your going to get these prices - better be polished on a Friday night with a seven-ish reservation, we are one of four tables in the entire restaurant with a departure time at 9pm with 1 table left. The service was just OK and again like everyone else and we tipped 15 to 20%. I'm not making excuses, just very disappointing since I have dined in the islands with this group.  Guess I did not get the memo, but with three or four tables on a Friday night -  I doubt they're gonna be around much longer and maybe that's the plan.  If someone actually post a review and reads this can they please ask why the edamame soy bean appetizer comes with sugar on it and not salt or chili oil.  That was so weird to drink wine and have a sugar appetizer.",

Okay the food tasted fantastic so it was definitely worth the wait.  Now for the unbelievable part we did not see our waiter again.  Nope another 30 minutes went by and we were finished eating thinking well that was great but I sure could use a refill on my tea.  I literally had to grab this young kid  and ask him if we could get a refill.  Then we sat there for about 20 minutes looking around for our waiter.  I finally grabbed this guy that looked like he might be in charge and told him we would like our check and that we hadn't seen our waiter since we placed our order!  He went and got him and low and behold he came to our table with our check.  No apology just left the check and off he went.  Really??  I was fit to be tied to say the least!  Our bill was $121 we did not leave a tip!  I will NEVER go back there again!",

The starter that my wife and I both chose was the coconut shrimp.  The flavor was delicious.  My wife's was cooked perfectly.  Mine was dark brown, severely overcooked, and tough.  The clam chowder was not at all a traditional clam chowder, and was delicious, as well.  My butterfish entree was cooked perfectly, but so oversauced that I had to scrape everything off it to eat it.  The flavor of the sauce literally drowned any butterfish flavor.  My wife's Mahi Mahi tasted \"fishy\" and was tough and hard to chew.  The chocolate souffle for dessert was excellent.  Service was quite good, after we asked the waiter to slow things down - otherwise, it was rushed, rushed, rushed in an effort to turn tables.  Disappointingly, the ambiance was dreadful - many tables in what was one sparsely decorated large room - as if you were in a convention hall.  We've eaten in Roy's in Pebble Beach, Chicago, and Orlando.  We will go back to those as they were excellent.  We will avoid Roy's Chandler forever.  It wasn't worth eating there and is not worth going back.",

Not only did I love the dishes, I learned a few techniques that could be useful for any type of cooking.

That being said...it wasn't a disaster...just didn't live up to my expectations from previous visits to other Roy's locations.   For an appetizer we got the Szechuan Pork Ribs which is still a favorite of mine here and I swear I would eat a whole rack of that. No complaints there. For the entree I got Ahi tuna and my date got the butterfish from my recommendation as I remember that being really good. I understand quality food takes time...and maybe I was really hungry as I was at the gym prior to coming here but it felt like ages before we got our food....seriously like 30-40 minutes or so from when we ordered it...I feel that is pretty long. I think our server forgot to put our order in until like 15 minutes have gone by.   By the time our food arrived I was full on bread but I can always make room for delicious!....problem was...they forgot the delicious in my Ahi...it was dry and bland...I was disappointed...I tried to like it...I even didn't send it back at first even though my date kept insisting....but after taking a bite of her butterfish I realized what i was missing...so I sent it back and got the butterfish....which was just as good as I remembered.   For dessert as allways...the chocolate souffle which is always a favorite.   All in all the reason I'm giving 3 stars is the speed of food delivery and the blandness of the Ahi. I will come again and will re-review when I go back...i just hope for a better visit next time.   PS: Both my drink and my date's drink were delicious. I got the pineapple mojito and she got a melon margarita.",

I would buy this wine at Roy's or Total Wines. The food was perfectly paired with the wine. Roy's even substituted out one item due to a food allergy for me. This event has renewed my faith in Roy's!

It was a hefty gift card ($75) so I thought it would go a long way. Well, it barely covered our meal, which was during the time they called \"brunch\" that I was thinking would be like a brunch buffet. No, you had to order off a very limited menu, but the items on it were very good. Luckily they were able to accommodate hubby with a special vegetarian menu. I had a delicious mimosa (champagne and orange juice, I gather? Sorry, not a drink I'm terribly familiar with), they refilled hubby's soft drink before he even asked, I had the lobster omelette and hubby had some stir-fry dish with rice, veggies and tofu. We split a lime tart. I think it's a great, beautifully appointed place if you want to really dress up and go all spendy for a wedding anniversary or the like, but it's not exactly casual dining. Great for a once-a-year celebration spot.",

Partly because we enjoyed the food so much that day. My boyfriend and I shared an appetizer and a 3 course meal. We started out w the lobster bisque. SO delicious! Creamy and the lobster tasted fresh. For the course we had a calamari salad. It was not greasy and had a ton of flavor. They didn't have a sauce probably because it wasn't necessary! For the main course we had the shredded pork and rice. I'm having it as leftovers 2 days later for lunch and it's still soOo good. So tender and it melts in your mouth. The rice was soft and fluffy and it came w a boiled egg that was fried or something. Just amazing. I'm not a big dessert person but we had the chocolate souffle w ice cream. Pretty good and I'm assuming it was because my BF finished the whole plate. I will be back any times more if the food is consistent. Oh.. Almost forgot.. Tried their Mai Tai.. Again I'm not a fan of sweets and their Mai Tai was too sweet for my taste. The server said it was made all at once and offered to make me another one to my liking. He took it off my bill and was very nice about taking it back. Love this place!",

To be honest, the Butterfish was pretty good, but it should be at $38 dollars.  Here is where Roy's fell completely apart for us. The server was absolutely terrible, I told him that this was our first time at Roy's, but that didn't appear to matter. He never introduced himself, never told us about the specials and had a unpleasant attitude the entire time.  I overheard the server behind us introduce himself, being very professional, and explaining the menu in detail.  I can't remember the last time I didn't leave 20% gratuity, but quite frankly, the server \"Brandon\" deserved 0% and additional training. I'm not some kind of food snob, but Introducing yourself, and assisting the customer \"who is a first time guest\" isn't asking very much. We moved to Arizona 18 month ago, and Roy's left a terrible taste in my mouth. Awful Experience!  Gary L Traylor",

    "text": "Anniversary dinner with Roy and the gang. Perfect evening to dine on the patio, started off with a jalapeno margarita and light salad. Then went all in with the boneless ribeye and wasabi mashed potatoes. The glaze was savory and the steak cooked perfect to a medium rare.   Wife got a seafood sampler plate with butterfish (favorite), salmon (close second) and Mahi Mahi (good but a little too fishy-compared to the others).   Finished with a blood orange cake (shoulda done the souffle, live and learn) which was a little sweeter than I like, but still very enjoyable.   Ben was an awesome server, knew every bit of the menu, and perfectly attentive.  Considering we usually are on a cruise ship somewhere for our anniversary, this made staying home well worth it.  Looking forward to the next time!",

We plan to go back for our anniversary dinner each year.  Each location has a slightly different menu so when I was in Phoenix for a business trip I wanted to make sure to get the chef's specials for this location. I had the lobster sushi roll and lobster pot stickers for appetizers, and the Himalayan Sea Salt Ribeye with a side of scallops for the entree. Although I love Roy's I have to say the steak wasn't that great. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly, but the cut of meat had too much connective tissue I had to work around. The scallops were wonderful, soft and tender and very flavorful.   I've been here so many times with 5 star experiences that I'm averaging it out to 4 stars for this review.",

    "text": "One of our favorite restaurants!!  We discovered there was one in Chandler and it just happened to be extremely close to our hotel.  We went for Happy Hour and had some drinks and appetizers.  My wife loves the pineapple martini, and I had the Kona longboard, which is what I had at the Roy's in Hawaii.  An authentic Hawaiian beer!  The spiced pork ribs are awesome and tastes great!  The spring rolls were good too, but not as good as the ribs.  I ordered the butterfish, which is a great, tender, mild fish.  My wife had the ahi tuna entree.  Both were delicious, properly cooked and tasted fresh (although I don't know if it was).  The sauce on the butterfish was great, although there was a hint of wasabi, which I didn't really like.  It also came with black rice, which tastes almost like risotto with a sweetness.  I didn't care for he rice too much, but my wife liked it.  And, of course, we got dessert.  Chocolate souffle for me, and the pineapple upside down cake for the wife.  Both were delicious, but you need to order it early because it takes 20 minutes to make.  We need to give kudos to our bartenders, Justin and Samantha.  We sat at the bar and they served us dinner and drinks all night.  They were very attentive to our needs and chatted us up a bit when things were slow.  Truly professional, friendly, and both made great pineapple martinis.  Loved the drinks, food, and the overall experience!!",

Our waitress was so nice and very informative about the menu. My husband and I normally don't drink when we go out to eat but he decided to go ahead and order a beer. He asked for a \"Dos Equis\" and they let him know that they didn't carry that brand. He decided to go for his other favorite beer, Blue Moon, which they did carry. Sadly, the beer never came. Our waitress must have forgotten. The group that she was serving next to us was ordering so many drinks and so many menu items so she might have felt the tip over there was going to be higher and proceed to neglect us a little bit. Not a big deal.   The food was really good and we, of course, ordered the chocolate souffle. Unfortunately, when I cut into the souffle, the chocolate didn't ooze out like it normally does. It was certainly over-baked. Again, not a huge deal as I've had it in the past and it's always been incredible. I'm sure it was just a fluke.   Could our service and experience been better? I think so. Will be go back? Certainly!",

    "text": "Roy's sent out a promotional email with a $25 off coupon, so my husband and I went for our anniversary.    The food here just isn't as good as it is in the Roy's locations in Hawaii. I thought I might have been too picky the first time we visited this location a few months ago, or perhaps the kitchen was having an off-night, but our food this time around was even worse:   Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs: should have been savory and melt in your mouth. It was just ok. It was much better prepared on our last visit.  Side dish of Szechuan string beans: I  was appalled. It was a pile of steamed green beans -- that's it. When I asked the server, he checked with the kitchen and said they had sauteed the green beans in the Szechuan sauce. It clearly wasn't, but I asked if I could have some of the sauce on the side, so he brought some. The sauce was ok, but not really Szechuan. From what I could see it was just shoyu and chilipaste. Was pretty miffed I had to even pay for this.  Alaea Salt Crusted Bone in Ribeye - My husband ordered this. It was fine for a steak, but nothing great. The biggest disappointment was the Truffled bacon mac n cheese! It had zilch seasoning, had very little cheese sauce, and there was hardly any bacon. I'm someone who can get by without much seasoning, unlike Ryan who wants 10lbs of salt on everything, but even I thought it was waaaaay underseasoned.   Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake (forget the actual name on menu): The last time I was here, I commented that it was a bit chewy. I was hoping for a better one this time, but it was even worse. There was not much oozing of chocolate goodness unfortunately, and the cake was even harder/chewier than last time.  I think if you've never been to Roy's in Hawaii, the food is fine and you'll enjoy your meal here. But if you have been to Roy's in Hawaii, it will be a letdown. There is just no comparison!",

No, I've never been in Hawaii, and yes, I like fish, so how can I not be tempted.  True to the word about Hawaiian hospitality, I felt welcome and accommodated by the staff throughout the entire meal. Bonus point for our waiter too for her recommendation and also for knowing her stuff about the ingredients on our dish. For our entrees, I had my fish and my companion had duck, Hawaiian-Asian fusion it is. Three delectable portion of fish meat called Roy's Classic Trio (mahi mahi, salmon, and butterfish) tastefully decked with rich sauces adorned my long three hollow plate. It goes with flavored rice, and whew, I can't even describe how heavenly it satisfies my palate. My friend's well done duck breast, contrary to the chef's recommended medium cooked, is texturally juicy. Prepare to spend on the mid-range price but every bite is worth it.  There were two dinner functions when we were there so the noise level was kind-a up, other than that, I think it is a cozy place for a date night. Will ask for a booth on my next visit and will definitely come back.",

My husband and I don't eat meat, but we LOVE fish - so we ordered 1 of each of the fish appetizers served during Aloha hour...  1) Mahi Fish Taco - Super fresh and a nice crunch...oh and the jalapeno sauce -YUM! 2) Lobster Potstickers - also very nice...wish there were more than 3 per portion 3) Ahi tuna roll - Definitely our favorite of the four! One of the best sushi rolls i've ever had 4) Ebi Roll - close second to the ahi roll...the addition of mango  really elevated this \"shrimp tempora\" roll to a new level  We finished it off with the lemon cheesecake - so refreshing!

    "text": "03/31/11  Had planned to partake in Fleming's happy hour (had a giftcard), but came here instead when I saw how busy it was at the bar (and I didn't want to sit outside in the heat).  I knew Roy's had a quasi-HH (free edamame-- what kind of HH is that?), so I had resigned to have Roy's tasty Waimanolo (sp?) salad.  Surprise, surprise!  Roy's now offers four food items (ahi tuna, calamari, Wagyu sliders, and beef skewers!), as well as a few wines by the glass and ALL of its signature cocktails during happy hour for $5 each!  I've tried the skewers before and wasn't too impressed, but I knew the calamari was very good, so I didn't go for that (even though I really wanted to have some).  No, what I had my eye on were the Wagyu beef sliders, w/ caramelized onions and, wait... what else did I read?  Sweet potato fries??  Oh, yeah!  My name was all over this dish!  I also placed an order for chardonnay, but I changed my mind when I saw that I could try another of Roy's signature drinks-- the last ones I'd tried many, many months ago were my espresso martini and a friend's lemon martini I'd sampled.  I was doubly-excited when I spotted Roy's Hawaiian take on the classic sidecar!  This happy hour was going to be FUN!  The Fred and Ginger cocktail did NOT disappoint!  It contained Hennessy VS cognac and Domaine du Canton ginger liqueur w/ a candied ginger peel garnish served in a martini glass.  It was beautiful to behold and so very delicious to sip!  'Twas a shame I couldn't finish the whole drink-- had to save some room for the sliders and fries (and the dessert I hadn't even planned on having later on!).  I really liked the sliders-- there were two of them, one on either side of the mini-Chinese takeout box filled w/ seasoned crispy sweet potato fries.  The sliders tasted like Whoppers (back in its heyday in the early 80's) kicked up several notches (LOVED the crispy/chewy pretzel buns!), and the fries were seasoned w/ herbs and even had a bit of cheese drizzle here and there!  I would definitely order the cocktail and app again, and for $5 each, they're a steal!    (I almost did not want to yelp about Roy's happy hour, bec. I wanted to keep this a secret for a little while.)  Thinking back, the cocktail and app would've been enough to satisfy me for the rest of the day, but I didn't really want to leave Roy's just yet ( had planned to write a review or two), so I broke down and decided to try the Chocolate souffle ($9.95), Roy's take on the chocolate lava cake, but w/ homemade vanilla bean ice cream and a raspberry coulis.  This item is baked to order, so if you are on a time limit, you should place your order in early, as it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  Was it worth the wait?  Hmm...  I liked the outer edges of the chocolate cake, which had the chewiness of a soft, fresh-baked brownie.  The lava center was definitely gooey and rich, and it tasted like hot brownie batter.  I think I'd have enjoyed the cake and its lava center a lot more if the accompanying vanilla ice cream was of a better quality.  I didn't care for its texture (not creamy enough), nor its flavor (vanilla bean specks were absent and the vanilla essence wasn't strong enough).  This dish cost as much as the app and cocktail combined, and I didn't think it was worth the price.  Can't wait to go back here for HH w/ friends!",

She is ready for promotion....she was probably the most polite  employee there.  Even the manager refilled our drinks once.  Everything was served quickly and with a smile.  The food was excellent!  I highly recommend the short ribs. My husband marvels at the creamy texture of the mashed potatoes. The only issue was that we had to wait for our table 15 minutes after our reservation time. A couple arrived after us but were seated before us. Even if their reservation was the same time or before ours, it's my opinion that you should seat waiting/on time people first. We will be back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Roys tonight (8/3) to celebrate my new job. We came in with the mindset of getting whatever we wanted regardless of the price, we were looking to spend money! We have heard nothing, but amazing things and we were excited. We both ordered some wine, along with the lobster potstickers..... AMAZING! For our entree, we ordered the butterfish and I ordered the shellfish sampler... so we thought. My boyfriend received his food and he enjoyed it! However, they brought me the salmon, I told the server that this is not what I ordered and that I ordered the trio with lobster, he quickly sent back my food and within 10 minutes I had a new plate of food........ Roy's trio, again NOT WHAT I ORDERED. I am in the service industry and felt bad correcting my order again, but when you expect lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp and then a fish platter shows up I am sure you could understand my disappointment. My server recognized that I hardly touched my food, I only ate the salmon considering I do not like the taste of other fish. He never asked if anything was wrong with it or why my food was hardly even touched. We went in an hour before closing and were treated like we walked in 5 minutes before. The table next to us had the same server and waited forever for the meals. We were EXTREMELY disappointed considering we spent $170 on a meal where I left hungry and didn't receive anything I ordered besides potstickers. Your servers NEED to repeat orders when they are taken, you lost a guest that was really excited to make Roys a new date spot!!",

Was immediately seated in a nice booth. Drink order taken by Chase, who turned out to be a great Waiter. Cocktails were excellent. Started with wedge salad, good, with crisp bacon. Had the lanilanaulei (?) Roll. Wagyu beef, crab, asparagus. Delicious, melted in mouth! I then had the always excellent Ribs. Didn't disappoint.  We both had the Butterfish. Superb! Rich, luscious, and flaky. No fishiness at all. Comes with black rice, not one of my favorites. For dessert, wife had the decadent chocolate molten cake, I had the pineapple upside down. Deelicious. Both with vanilla and coconut ice cream. This was a pretty expensive dinner, and we agreed, worth it. Came away completely satisfied. We'll be back soon, they have some excellent price fix specials. Thanks to Chase and crew for the great service.",

We were offered a table in the bar area but what was the point of making a reservation for that.  Once we finally got to our table it was another 15 minutes before our waitress bothered showing up.  Before we could place our drink orders she disappeared.    Once we finally got her back and placed our order, things went better. The drinks were Devine and the food was delicious. I would highly recommend their signature drink that comes in the metallic pineapple. We just had to laugh how comical the service was. If I'm going to spend over $100 for a meal, I would at least like to be waited on a little.  Hope this place can get its act together as it really does have a lot of potential.",

Not many people must know that they are open because when we went a couple weeks ago it was only us and one other party. But not a problem for us as it granted us excellent service! We started with the lobster potstickers (a must in my book) and the lobster bisque (not pictured) which were both amazing. The lunch potions come on cute little plates served with soup, and side salad, and white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. I got the Shrimp and Pineapple Fried Rice which was enjoyable, but I've definitely had better entrees from this establishment. Great dining experience, will definitely be back!",

Large charges were placed on both peoples cards and police reports were made. Wallets never to be found.  When calling Roy's again speaking to a manager she said we're sorry.  Very little concern and tried to hang up quickly.  Be very careful or your surrounding if you go here and do not hang a bag on your chair.  I also thought the food and service were mediocre and the \"fried rice\" was actually steamed white soggy rice.",

The bartender was a little rude, maybe just aloof...but definitely not put together. I don't understand why management wouldn't want their bartenders to look presentable especially when working at a nicer restaurant. Does it really take a lot of effort to brush your hair or put on a little makeup..she looked like she just rolled out of bed to go serve her local dive bar. Makes me feel like I'm at some hole in the wall place. Didn't help that another bartender or server who was tabbing someone out in front of me put the persons credit card in his MOUTH while he messed with the screen. Come on, seriously.   Besides that the ambiance was fine, I sat at the bar on a Friday and while it was busy, you could still get a seat pretty quick. The ribs for $7 happy hour price were AMAZING. You get 4 and they slide right off the bone. Can't say enough good things about them and everyone was ordering them. The lobster potstickers were sooo good too, definitely will order again. We also tried the mac and cheese (didn't like them - it was more noodles with not enough flavor or cheese), and the crab fried rice (I liked there were big pieces of crab in them, would probably get again).  It's a good place to try, I'd like to go back for their full dinner menu.",

The food, well, I haven't had anything this good since I was in Maui last summer. I had an unlimited gift card so I tried MANY dishes. If you haven't tried Roy's before I suggest the many sampler plates, you will find a favorite! Mine is the Miso Butterfish, melts like butter in your mouth, with a flavor experience you have never had before! Less fusiony dish-The filet mignon is to die for! Service was sketchy, I had to refill my own sparkling water twice! We waited a long time  without a check in from our waiter in between orders!!! Hence, the 4 stars, not 5! Dishes were on small side so you will need an appetizer and dessert to be \"full.\" I would eat here again, especially if I'm not buying, it's a little pricey but great experience!",

The appies were very good as were the drinks we tried almost all between the 4 of us. Good value at 7$ a piece. Did look at the dinner menus which looked amazing but pricey. As for dessert  go to the chocolate souffle as soon as you can it's amazing",

Once seated the service was outstanding, it was a crazy busy night and the staff all worked very well together.  The food was very good, although the ceviche appy was very small and in my opinion not worth getting, the others dining with me had the soft shell crab and they were delicious.  The Hot and Sour soup was a bit spicy but so tasty.  The entrees all great as well.  We were all given $20 to return in the next few weeks, we will go back for sure to take advantage of that.",

    "text": "My hubby and I ate here last night for my birthday dinner.  I wanted to go somewhere close to our house but didn't feel like steak.  A lot of independent restaurants are closed on Mondays so that is why we had to do a chain. I am not sure if that also explains why this place was so packed.  It may also be due to the fact that they have a great prix-fix deal on Mondays where you can get almost any appetizer, entree, and dessert combination for just $37.  Not a bad deal since we both left the place absolutely stuffed to the brim and we are both big eaters.  Overall, the service at this place is really great and the food is prepared well.  I really enjoyed our visit there but I would never really become a regular since for some reason I am just not a fan of their menu.  I love seafood, but most of their dishes come with a ton of sauce or crusted or wrapped in something.  I think if you have fresh, high quality seafood then you should just let the flavor of the food shine through.  That's just me.  I did really like the taste of the wasabi sauce on my butter fish entree. I highly recommend ordering that dish. And also, their cocktails. I have sampled a few of their specialties on the drink menu and they are all quite good even if they are way overpriced.  I think Roy's is a great option for happy hour when you are looking for something a little higher class than your basic patio bar or for dinner when you feel like a taste of the islands. But I can't honestly say I'm a fan, hence the three stars.",

As far as ambiance, the Desert Ridge location is better since it is located in a resort and their patio seating makes you feel like you are in Hawaii (think palm trees and tiki torches) The Roy's in Chandler location is located in a mall area. The food and the service at the Chandler location were excellent. I got my usual which is the Ahi and hot chocolate souffle. Everything was delicious. We were celebrating some birthdays and the staff made us feel special with birthday desserts and a group picture. Would definitely return if we are in the area again. Rating 4 stars instead of 5 just because of the mall location. We have dined at many other Roy's restaurants all over the country. Many other Roy's locations have great views, this one does not.",

When I called to make the reservation, the hostess was super friendly, and asked if we were celebrating a special occasion.  They had an 'Anniversary table' setup for us, and we appreciated the added 'champagne toast' upon being seated.  There was a specific TravelZoo menu, and all options sounded delicious.  We chose the crispy chicken spring rolls as an appetizer, our salads were fresh with a light and tasty citrus dressing.  We shared a grilled, marinated salmon and baked chicken; both were so tasty.  Then we shared the Chocolate Torte w/fresh berries and cream.  All portion sizes were perfect.  The atmosphere was calm & crisp, and definitely clean.  Our server and the host were very attentive.  We will definitely return...that's a big deal for my husband! :-)",

    "text": "So yummy! They serve you edamame instead of bread. It's so flavorful. It's spicy and sweet - addicting!   I then got a mango martini sans the mint. Oh my goodness also too addicting! So great and bubbly.  I tried their specialty drink that was infused in pineapple for 2 weeks. It was pretty good. If you like coconut you'll like this.   We got the sampler plate. It was OK.  It had sushi, spring rolls, ribs and other food.   I had the Mahi Mahi for dinner. It was great.  Not fishy tasting at all. One negative to the dish was the side dishes. It came with asparagus and sliced potatoes.  The potatoes were so disappointing because they were flavorless and tasted a bit too hard. Besides that the dish was very good with extremely flavorful sauce.   We had pineapple upside down cake and the lava cake for dessert. The pineapple upside down was nothing worth writing home about. It didn't have very much flavor to it.  I've made a box mix pineapple cake that tasted better. It didn't even have that classic sugar crispness that you normally get from the brown sugar.  The lava cake was scrumptious. I do have to say the one negative about it was the raspberry sauce. It didn't taste good. The chocolate cake was still very good and very sweet.    This place is definitely a special occasions kind of place as it is quite pricey.",

    "text": "1st time visitor for Birthday dinner.  Had high hopes.  Family of 3 ordered the chefs tasting menu.  Watermelon salad consisted of 5 bite size chunks of melon with a fresh cheese spread & dot of vinegar to touch melon in with a few sprouts atop.  It could have been much better.  The plates sat near the heat lamp too long and were quite warm along with the melon.  I was expecting cold crisp melon.  I really don't like to complain.    The 3 of us ordered flank steak atop sesame spinach with mushrooms.  The other orders of same dish looked appealing.  My entree was quite charred and when I took a bite I realized they covered it with soy sauce to try to soften the charred beef up.  The spinach was also covered in soy sauce.  The two other same entrees were not swimming in soy sauce.  I couldn't eat that.  I did bring it to managers attention.  What kind of chef would let that strap of leather flank steak leave their kitchen?   Molasses tart with vanilla ice cream was good.  Extremely sweet center.  So sweet I couldn't eat all of it. Been there tried it won't go back.",

    "text": "This place was soooo good in many ways but I really held back on one star because the connectivity was a bit wanton. I felt I had to work to be treated like I belonged there commenting on the food. The lack of a sommelier is a noticeable miss also since there is an extensive wine list but nothing but up sellers pushing the most expensive options without real pairing consideration.  We found a pretty nice South African wine called Excelsior which was a less expensive cabernet sauvignon which matured in  stages.  It really went well with the all the fish with initial fruity tones of fig and a peppered wood. Sophisticated if you wait a good 30 minutes.  I got the combo trio plus one that is not on the menu but available... butterfish to die for, seared ahi ahi, teriyaki salmon, and a lovely grilled fish ( cannot remember which it was but it sat royally atop a lovely prepared potato slice).  Impeccable sauces and vegetable pairings were just the right thing to set this place apart from other fish houses.    I could not help but also try a guiness chocolate cake special.  If it sticks around, definitely try it if you want to skip the souffle.  But who skips souffle unless they've had it every day for a month?!   I have to acknowledge my servers, Ben and Erin.  They really worked hard to try to answer questions and were attentive to my needs.  My only note for improvement has to do with setting the tone initially.  There was something lacking a bit to make the experience warm from the start.  Perhaps it seemed too rehearsed and not genuine.  It was all redeemed after it seems Erin relaxed and was herself and got to really participating in our dining experience versus just serving us.  Does that make sense? In other words, by the time we were leaving I felt like she really did care that I had a good experience.  Still, it was good and I will return.",

    "text": "Tonight my boyfriend and I went out to celebrate Valentine's Day since I was out of town last week. We wanted to try this place out because we drive past it all the time. Well it went down hill from the beginning. The host acted surprised that we walked in. It wasn't busy at all and we stood there with her writing something on a paper for about 3 mins before she walked us to the table. The restaurant was small but nice. We sat at the table for about 5 mins before some girl who never introduced her self or welcomed us to Roys said \"ice water or bottled.\"  We then sat there and other 5 min before a different male server dropped the water off. He did seem friendly either and walked away. We were so confused on who our server was. After sitting for a total of 15 mins before anyone came to take an order. There was about 5 other tables in the whole restaurant, not busy at all. Then finally the girl who took our water order came by and asked if we were ready to order (later found out her name was Nicole when we cashed out.) We asked if the meals were a la Carte because the menu was a bit confusing and she replied the meal comes with a veggie and a starch. When we ordered she didn't even mention what our meals came with. We ordered the calamari to start with. That was delicious. We were barley checked on. I know it was towards the end of the night but that doesn't count for poor service. Our meal came out about 20 min later. The meal was good but disappointing. The server did not know her menu. I only received a veggie and my boyfriend only received a starch when we were told we would receive both. They poured sauce all over my steak that was not mentioned on the menu which ruined the flavor of the steak. Would have been better if they put the sauce on the side. The food was good. I wouldn't say excellent, my boyfriend can grill better then what we had, but the service was awful. No one was friendly, or trying  to give us a WOW experience. When you go out to eat it's the atmosphere and the food that your paying for and it was the worst dining experience I have ever been too. The night was a loss and has put my boyfriend in a horrible mood that he wasted his money on that. We will never be returning or recommending this place to any family or friends. Spending ur money at McDonalds would have been a better night.",

From the edamame they serve instead of bread to the lobster potstickers to the Cesar salad, everything was melt in your mouth delicious! I had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi, and it was truly a dissolve in your mouth tender with a light crunch coating. We shared 2 martinis before dinner. The 1988 and a pineapple one. Both were fabulous. This has become our new favorite place to go for special dinners or anytime dinners for that matter. The service was excellent, though a tad slow coming from the kitchen, but since every thing is to order, that's understandable. The decor and ambiance was spectacular , lots of bamboo, flowers and tiki torches with a modern twist. Definite go to this place! You cannot go wrong!!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time. The restaurant is clean and inviting. It was a weeknight and not busy at all. We were sat immediately, greeted and ordered drinks right away. Our server was, helpful and ready to answer any questions we had.m. We didn't need any questions answered but it was clear our server was prepared to guide us through the menu if needed. For a slow night, there did seem to be quite a long time between ordering a drink and being checked on for questions or to take our order.  Once our drink was up, our server came took our order. He confirmed how we wanted our dinner paced and then let us know that certain desserts take a bit of extra time to prepare so if we were considering any it would enhance our experience to give him a chance to fire it during our main course so he could time it correctly. We had already ordered a dessert, but it was a nice touch at ensuring we had the best experience. It was also a great, natural way to try for an up-sell without being too pushy.  All the food came out in a timely manner, and once things got going the service from our server and the expo/runner/busser was very attentive. We're easy though, just keep the food on the table and drinks/water in the cups. One thing missing from the overall service is that the expo/runner could've had more menu knowledge. Although, the expo/runner was unable to answer a question I had while the food came out, they made sure to send the sever by the answer. It sounds simple but I find it important that service team members are comfortable asking each other for help. I'm sure if  the question was more difficult and our server didn't know, they would've been completely comfortable asking the chef.  Onto the food, we ordered the seasonal \"sampler\" 3 course meal designed by the head chef as well as a couple appetizers and the rack of lamb. We started with truffle fries, a Hawaiian inspired roll and some Korean inspired dumplings. The fries were good, but the truffle felt almost non existent, maybe were just used to bold truffle flavors. The mandu (Korean dumplings) were savory and in a chili sauce that satisfied my want for a more bold flavor to start. The roll we ordered was essentially a CA roll (crab/avo base) with a deep-fried asparagus topped with rare wagyu beef and using snow crab instead of imitation or real crab. I like my sushi to speak for itself and it did. Although it was very non-traditional, it wasn't covered in sauce as is typical of many sushi restaurants (especially the Korean owned/inspired sushi). I like my sushi with less or no sauce on it and this roll was well-balanced and the light drizzle of sauce was the perfect amount.  For our entrees, we had a beef galbi as part of the season 3 course meal and the pistachio crusted rack of lamb. The meat was cooked to a perfect med rare and very tender. The veggies on the lamb plate complimented the meat. The galbi came with a kimchi mash which was what I had to ask about and where I feel the runner should've had a little more menu knowledge. Since the galbi was part of a Korean themed set it was also played with bok choi and some bean sprouts.  The dessert that came with the seasonal set was a cotton cheesecake with a lychee sauce, some Asian pear, blue berries and sesame caramel I think. Cotton cheesecake has a texture between a sponge cake and a traditional cheesecake. It was fun to try but I don't think it can beat a classic NY style cheesecake. I also found the lychee sauce to add a bit too much sweetness, however it was bursting with lychee aroma and flavor.  All of the food was enjoyable. Somethings more than others. Next time I'm looking for an up-scale dinning experience I'd feel confident that I could come back and try the rest of the menu and leave satisfied again. Service was above par, but it's the small details that really polish the experience at a restaurant like this.  The food had rich flavors and entrees were both well rounded with enough complexity to make you want another bite. Because I enjoyed it all I hope the pictures I took help capture some of that. The food here is neither traditional (it's fusion) nor is it vanilla. By saying it's not vanilla, I mean the chef has put a lot of time into preparing these dishes and for the best experience I'd advise not modifying anything unless it's to avoid a food allergy. Thus compliments to the chef.",

I've heard so many great things about this place and I was let down with ever dish I ate and the service.   Service was very slow. It took them about 20 minutes to get our drinks and even more time to take our order.  Canoe Appetizer for Two - Its an appetizer boat with a little bit of everything. Szechuan Ribs , Spicy Tuna Roll, Lobster Potstickers Beef Macadamia Nut Spring Roll. Everything was just meh.  The best things were the potsickers. I would only order the potstickers if we could do a redo and not waste our money on everything else.   Misoyaki Butterfish  with furikaki rice. The fish was good, but it was drenched in sauce that was WAY TOO SWEET! What made it worse was that WITHOUT TELLING ME they gave me \"forbidden black rice\" with it instead of the furikaki rice. The forbidden black sticky rice was ALSO sweet. So my whole plate was just too much sugar. I was actually looking forward to having the furikaki rice so when I asked my waitress if this was the \"furikaki rice\" she said \"no, this is the forbidden black rice, they will switch things if they feel like it.\" WOW. That would have been nice to know before hand. She later asked me if I still wanted the furikaki rice because she could go get me some and I told her yes. She brought out a bowl of white rice with a little dash of furikaki on top. I was so excited because I thought that the white rice with a little saltiness would balance out the sweet fish. As I went to go dig my fork in to what I have been wanting, it was the DRIEST AND OLDEST tasting white rice I have ever had. This rice must have been there all day or every DAYS ago and microwaved back to life. It was NASTY. For a $$$ restaurant to give me that type of white rice, you've got to be kidding me.  Panda Express at least gives me better white rice then that. Such a disappointment.   Ribeye - I forget what the original side was that came with the ribeye, but it was lobster something. The waitress said that the side that came with ribeye was out so we could order a different side. We chose the fried rice. She offered to put the lobster on the fried rice since they didn't have the original side and so that we could still have some lobster since it came with the original order. So we agreed and were happy about it. When the food came out, it was a bowl of fried rice. We thought the lobster was mixed inside and cut in little pieces but we never found any. When we asked the waitress, she said she forgot and brought out 3 tiny pieces of lobster. WOW. Its kind of disappointing to see how little they offered, EVEN AFTER A MISTAKE. Let me remind you, we didn't ask for the lobster, SHE was the one who offered at the beginning since they didn't have the side. I honestly thought they ran out of lobster which is why they didn't have the side to begin with. But I guess that wasn't the case. The fried rice as just okay. The steak was pretty good though. It was cook perfectly. (too bad it wasn't my meal and I only got a peice TT__TT)  I can truly say, I was super disappointed in everything. For someone who made a reservation for a special night, this was a huge let down for my night. Some of the food was okay, but I was more disappointed by the service. Ive been to many popular upscale restaurants and this doesn't not even compete on the same level. I would have rather at home  Environment: 5/5 Food: 2/5 Price: 1/5 NOT WORTH THE PRICE Service: 2/5",

I don't expect impeccable service at every moment but we were seated with one menu for three people.  It took a long time fir anyone to come to the table so I grabbed one from the neighbor long empty table and two employees noticed but seemed okay with that.   This was at 4 pm, so there was more staff than customers still.  Next we got most of our food delivered with a place setting missing.  I took a set of silverware from the same table, again noticed by employees who did or said nothing.    We shared some entrees that I nibbles at while waiting for my simple dish, which never came.  No one came back so we flagged down our server who finally got the dish with no apology.  No one checked on us, no one cleaned dirty plates until we flagged our server down.

    "text": "UPDATE from last Birthday!  The manager was kind enough to ask me to come back and try another b-day meal on them-to see if they can't make it right. I wasn't expecting that, and I appreciated the gesture - that's class.  So off I went, hoping for a better experience. And I got it.  Heres what I had:  Hawaiian-tini (martini) I've had these many times, and I have always loved them. This one was not as sweet and tasty, and tasted like almost no alcohol. Hmmm.never had a bad one of these, so I was getting worried about the meal. BUT-it was the only real \"miss\" of the night.  They served me a small free appetizer, and it was very tasty.  No complaints-I really enjoyed it.  I ordered surf and turf (lobster and filet mignon), med/rare.  I enjoyed the lovely atmosphere and appetizer while I waited on the main course.  The server was not as attentive as they usually are, but he was pretty young and probably pretty new.  I had to flag someone for more water (not him-he disappeared). I went at 5PM, so they hardly had the tables filling. BUT, he was nice and pleasant!   The meal looked great, and I sucked down the delicious lobster very quickly. It was moist and flavorful, not always such an easy feat!  The steak had kind of two parts: one small piece on one end, attached to a larger hunk. They were covered in a delicate but tasty sauce. I had trouble cutting into the small piece, it had gristle. Yuck! I stopped and focused on the larger piece, and it was GREAT; moist and tender and very good flavor.    The \"french fries\" will fool you. They are crispy and very flavorful. I LOVED them - and I'm not a big \"fry\" fan. Don't flinch - try them  A lady came by and asked how the food was (the server never did) and I hesitated a second-not sure to bring up the gristle side-as all else was so good, but she noticed and asked e-so I told her - but not upset or anything. She offered a whole new steak, but there was enough left on the other piece to satiate me so I said it wan't necessary- but thank you.  Then, she said \"I will have them adjust the bill a little-I know those smaller pieces can get gristly\".  I was appreciative went on to enjoy the biggest side of the meat.  I ordered the delicious pineapple upside down cake. I do love the volcano fudge, but sometimes need a subtle flavor. It was very good-love it.  It was a good night, I was full and felt they vindicated themselves.  I will go back now, and enjoy their usually quite tasty food!  And, the waiter was very sweet when I paid - I think he was just a little green- no shame there.  Thank you Roys!",

The pineapple martini is always a fave and was great here. My fish was great, but my friends wasn't. He said they gave him the worst part of the fish as he compared his to everyone's at the table.

I ordered the chef special, herb crusted halibut which was juicy and tender, cooked to perfection.  My husband had the butterfish which was good but a little too sweet for his taste.  We were then presented with a complementary dessert, molten lave chocolate cake circled by a raspberry gastric and vanilla ice cream.  It was hands down the BEST dessert I've ever had!!!

    "text": "Roy's is the exception to our general rule of not frequenting chain restaurants, it is an exception because they stand out and do things exceptionally. Mom always requests to go here when she visits, and last night we celebrated her Birthday with Tyler as our very cheerful and adept server.   Any Roy's location captures the Aloha spirit and vibe with decor and cheerfulness of staff; we were guided to our booth adorned with orchids and including a Birthday card for Mom. Tyler introduced himself, wished Mom a Happy Birthday, and took our water order whilst we perused the menus.   A creature of habit, I must have the Paradise Found cocktail, partially because I adore the ginormous copper 'pineapple' they serve it in. Similarly, I always have the lobster bisque, poured tableside over a generous amount of lobster meat and bit of heat offset by a light coconut note. Scott and Mom split and enjoyed the wedge salad.   This time Mom and I both had my regular entree, the shellfish sampler, can't recommend it enough: a perfectly cooked lobster tail, seared scallops, and shrimp, accompanied by a lobster sauced rice. Scott had a filet which they always happily prepare blackened, subbing impossibly light mashed potatoes for the lobster mac, and we shared a side of mushrooms. All of our food was perfectly prepared, the timing of the dishes was on point, Tyler was engaging without being intrusive, and a Manager both checked in to wish Mom Happy Birthday and on us in general in spite of a large, raucous Duckhorn Wine Pairing meal being in process concurrently.   The lava cake with vanilla bean ice cream is a must for any chocolate lover, both Scott and Mom ordered this, which you must do 15 minutes in advance, FYI. Tyler brought a very tasty mango sorbet gratis which I enjoyed with my Sambuca aperitif.   Roy's is a great celebration spot, date night destination, has several private dining rooms, and catering menu options. Another not so spendy way to enjoy the beautiful bar area is through their nightly Aloha Hour option which offers drink, appetizer, and sushi specials. They have a patio outside with tiki torches which is probably great when it isn't so hot out.   So, we are total fans!",

I got the butterfish for the entree, spare ribs for appetizer and the pineapple upside down cake for dessert.  The butterfish melted in one's mouth.  Didn't know you could change the order of the rice, but the black rice was good.  The spare ribs were good and plenty for appetizers.  A lot bigger than I thought.  The dessert was a little too much for me in terms of quantity.  It's a lot for a single serving and probably could've been like 2 servings instead.  The restaurant wasn't too noisy but we were seated in a secluded area, so that's why it was probably quieter.  Nice ambiance.  Will be back.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place a 2 out of 5 stars mostly because of the service my girlfriend and I received when we last ate there on 8/3/19. We walked into an empty lobby at 8:50 at night which is one hour and ten minutes before they were set to close. We waited for about 5 minutes until we were greeted. The host seemed to be surprised when we said we wanted a table for two looking at us like we walked in 2 minutes before close. After getting seated we waited another 10 minutes for our server. We each ordered a glass of wine and the lobster potstickers both were great! We then ordered our entrees I got the butterfish and my girlfriend ordered the shellfish sampler, which consists of lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp. When the food came out I received my butterfish and my girlfriend received the hibachi grilled salmon. At first we thought it was a simple mix up and when we told the gentleman who delivered our food that she got the shellfish sampler with lobster we thought it would be taken care of. However, after waiting another 10 minutes to receive the correct dish they instead bring out the roys trio which is salmon, ahi tuna, and butterfish. My girlfriend who also works in the service industry decided to deal with this blunder and stick with what she received however she only ate the salmon as she did not like the taste of the other two fish. We were hoping our server would come by but he made sure to avoid all contact except to ask if we wanted a souffle. He never once asked how we liked our meals or even was curious as to why 2/3s of her plate had gone on eaten. I wish I could give this place more stars because the potstickers and my butterfish were delicious! If you're craving Roy's I'd recommend going to the one at Desert Ridge.",

Kids meals came with a fruit cup to start and dessert after. The wedge salads were phenomenal. I had the lobster bisque which had an amazing flavor but it upset my stomach and I was unable to enjoy the rest of my meal. I ordered the lobster omelet as my entree and was very underwhelmed. Not worth the high price tag. There was very little flavor and very little seafood in the omelet and a lot of onion, which I am not a huge fan of. Those in our party that ordered the steaks and short ribs were very pleased with their meals. The service was good, they changed out our silverware between each course, which we ended up laughing about by the end of the meal. I've never used so many different forks and spoons and knives in one sitting. The lighting was incredibly dim for a mid-day meal. I would understand if it was dinner time and they were trying for an intimate atmosphere, but it was 12 in the afternoon. I want to be able to read the menu, see the food I'm eating, see my family...well maybe not them so much but definitely the food!  If you want dessert you have to let them know early in the meal, as they need 20 minutes to prepare.",

    "text": "First visit.  This is a tricky review to write.  But I'll try.  This place is a little loud.  Not sure why.  It wasn't even full.  But it was loud.  Nice ambiance other than the 'loud'.  An understated tropical feel. I could do without the TV's in the bar, or at least partition them better.  Made the place look like a sports bar (there was some sort of sporting event going on).  The fish tank is nicer but too small to see everywhere.  This was our anniversary.  I expected the place to be full so I made reservations ahead of time.  They asked if we were celebrating anything, and they do a few special little things for your event.  That was nice.  There were three menus.  They had a special three-course meal menu (which my wife ordered), a one-page special drink menu (I didn't really look closely at that one), and the main menu.  The main menu is probably about 1/2 drink menu (the first two pages at least).  The waitress was very professional and explained the different menus, and then made some recommendations.  I went with the grilled ono (a type of fish) because she said it was a house specialty.  I also got the poke appetizer because I like poke.  So the appetizers arrive.  My wife chose the calamari salad as part of her three-course menu option.  I tried it.  It was good.  Not extraordinary, but good.  I did think adding heat to it was a bit odd.  Calamari isn't a strong flavor and you're going to add jalapeno to it (or whatever chile it was)?  I know you want to set yourself apart, but that doesn't seem like an appropriate match to me.  I will be returning to this theme shortly.  The poke was good.  I thought a bit too much avocado with it, but I could taste the poke.  It came with chips which would have been good for scooping, but the chips overwhelmed the poke.  Maybe it was the combination of a lot of avocado with the chips that dulled the poke too much, but I just ate it with a fork instead. It would have been better to emphasize the tuna in the poke.   My wife's entree was the mahi mahi.  By itself it wasn't really very good, but there was a little puddle of dipping sauce (green).  If you used that it was much better.  That flavor combination seemed to work reasonably well.  The kimchee pancakes that came with it were OK.  Not great.  Dipping sauce didn't help.  My ono was fine, if a little sour.  Delicate flavor that they didn't seem to do much with that I could detect.  Just grilled it, maybe some lemon juice (I assume since it was a little sour).  It came with a cheesy risotto that was too strong for the fish, but did counteract the sour.  It was good risotto, but I couldn't taste the fish at all.  So, again, we have a flavor combination that didn't seem to work right.  Presentation was impeccable for all dishes. They clearly paid attention to that detail, which is nice.  Service was pretty good.  Just about the time you started to wonder if they were going to check on you, they checked on you.  A little slower than other places, but at the same time they're giving you privacy for your dinner companion.  The last course was a chocolate souffle, and it was great.  A lot like a lava cake (really hot chocolate sauce inside).  It was probably the best thing we had that night.  My wife also really liked her mango \"martini\" (actually it was a mango-rum drink).  So in summary, we had flavors that didn't seem to compliment each other well in at least two things we ate.  Presentation was expert, service was good, the little extras for our anniversary were nice.  But I can't say I'm a fan, especially at these prices.  For the price paid the food should have been a harmonious symphony of flavors, not a dischordant attempt to partner mismatched flavors.  If you're going to try to be high-end and charge high-end prices, your food has to be high-end too.  And it just wasn't.  I'm willing to concede it may have been a function of what we ordered.  The mahi mahi with green sauce worked, but it's weird that two of our items didn't quite hit the flavor harmony that they should have.  I'm going with three stars (barely) because of the mahi mahi, the chocolate souffle, and the poke (without the chips).  But I would only recommend it with the caveat that maybe if you order something different you might have better luck with the flavor symphony.",

Of course, being the good son that he is, we all went here on our last night in town. And I wasn't disappointed. Walking into his establishment, I was amazed at the colorful decor. Splashes of vivid color in a Hawaiian themed restaurant were beautiful. The 2-D wall art was tastefully displayed. Upon being seated, our wait person, Anthony, was informative and gracious beyond reproach. From the 1st glass of water until our last bite of dessert, Anthony made our dining experience over the top. We began with calamari. OMG !! Melt in your mouth tender & battered to perfection. Piled high bite size pieces instead of rings. I had the trio which consisted of Butter Fish, Ahi Tuna & grilled Salmon. Each fish was drizzled with a different sauce which complimented each individual fish. To die for is an understatement. The presentation of each of our separate entrees was nothing but classy. After dinner, Anthony surprised us with their signature pineapple upside down cake & chocolate souffle. Both desserts were rich & delectable without being sweet.  As each of us ordered something different, it would take to much time to tell you what we each had. I would just strongly suggest that you make a date to take that special person in your life to Roy's for an unforgettable dining experience. Just ask for Anthony to be your server. I promise you won't be disappointed. Kudos to Roy's Restaurant & its staff of professionals !!!",

I went in craving my favorite dish (Misoyaki Butterfish), but decided to try the Shoyu Charred Rib Eye with sunny side-up egg, housemade kimchi and short rib hash. WOW! The rib eye was delicious, but that was expected; what wasn't expected was the kimchi and the short rib hash - both were absolutely to-die-for!  We also ordered the Roy's Benedict with Filet Mignon - again, the filet was delicious, but what stood out were the cheddar bacon biscuits and the Shiso Bernaise.  My dad ordered the Lobster and Shrimp omelet, which he said was excellent. (Side note: I was extremely impressed by the perfectly-uniform brunoise knife cuts on the omelet dish.)  Kudos to the management, Chef, kitchen staff and our server, Eric, for doing fine-dining correctly! .  Roy's is now my favorite brunch spot!",

It was a Monday night (not too busy) and our server Nicole let us wait nearly 20 minutes before taking our orders.  I had to notify the receptionist that we've been waiting for our server to come back, but she was nowhere to be seen.  Once I told them about that she immediately showed up and took our orders.  But it didn't stop there.  Drink refills were not checked and one of my guests never got a fork.  The one thing saving me from getting up again to find a manager was that I was among friends and we were having a wonderful conversation.  I would rate the food five stars, but the lack of service knocked the overall experience to three stars.  For such a nice restaurant with great food, I expect much better (and prompt) service.",

I usually ask for an extra scoop of vanilla ice cream.  We go here for all of our special occasions.  You won't go wrong if you do too!!!  Butterfish! Even the meatloaf rules!!!",

    "text": "First off, I will NEVER patron Roy's in Chandler ever again!! Please read on to see why...  A friend and I went for Aloha hour and it was awesome. Everything on the HH menu is only $5!   We enjoyed everything from the food, drinks, & service, that we decided to come back and try their dinner menu.  9/4/2010 My friends tried the Hibachi Style Grilled Salmon, they both were quite pleased. Perfect portion size, above average quality but yet still a bit pricey. Nonetheless, the dish was quite satisfying.   For my meal I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish.  It came with black \"forbidden\" rice and bok choy.  Each flaky bite was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Excellent choice!  This is where it gets ugly... As our average service was about to conclude, the waiter drops our check off. I ask him for another cup of coffee and as he pulls his hand back from delivering the check, he knocks a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone. He proceeds to apologize and cleans a portion of it up, then walks away. He never returns for the coffee I asked for, nor did he offer to refill my friend's $8 glass of wine. I gave him time to reconcile as I saw him pace back and forth but to no avail. I had to chase him down for my refill on coffee. Despite my friend getting wine spilled over her without compensation, our party decided to reflect our displeasure through our tip (~8%) opposed to an open, verbal complaint. However, our waiter wasn't pleased with his gratuity. He came back to the table after he discovered his low tip. YES! He actually had the nerve to return to our table as if he didn't understand why he received a low tip! He spilled wine, which we had paid for, on the customer without compensating for it! What did he expect??  He came back to the table asking if we were displeased with his service. Astonished by his ignorance, we explained to him what we were displeased with. Get this... He didn't think spilling the wine over my friend wasn't a big deal because he thought it was a small amount and that she was finished anyway. Imagine a waiter spilling a paid for glass of wine over you and justifying it because you were almost done anyway. Absolutely ridiculous! Plus, what did he expect from us at that point. Did he expect that we would change our minds and tip him more? The waiter apologized once more and we just got up and left. Our server, THOMAS  the absolute most ungrateful, inappropriate & rude bastard of a server I've ever encountered!!  The manager was of no assistance either. Just a note, in the Service Industry, there is no verbal apology that is acceptable. In the Service Industry, the only apology comes in the form of compensation. The manager apologized but asked if we would like to have gift certificates. That's like saying \"May I say 'Sorry' to you?\" He should've given, not asked to give. Putting the onus on the customer is an insult. We declined since acceptance would paint us as opportunists.  Bottom line you expect above the standard level of service when you're shelling out $25-40 per entree.  So even though the food was great, the horrible experience with how we were treated is cause enough to never return to this location.  It's like being slapped in the face but saying it's okay because the food was wonderful...NO THANK YOU!!",

This is not our first visit but it was definitely our best. We went for the prix fixe surf and turf with some reservations concerning the low price but were pleasantly surprised. Begin with the Miso soup, you will not be disappointed. The Lobster was broiled to perfection and the Filet Mignon was perfectly cooked tasting better than any steak I've had in the Phoenix metro area in recent memory. We were at Morten's last month and this blew them away. Last trip to Morten's for us. The service could have been a slight bit better although she was swamped and held her own with the help of the ancillary staff.  Our server was very friendly and kudos to her for the recommendation of pineapple upside down cake with toasted coconut ice cream. This was one of the best desserts I've EVER had and I love dessert. Our party of 4, 1 of which is quite a cook herself, was indeed impressed. As far as drinks go we all had Mai Thai's which had a slightly different flavor than any we had tasted before but that wasn't a problem as they were delicious! Great food, dessert and drinks, need I say more? OK, good times, good food...",

The service was, as it always has been, excellent and friendly, but the food just didn't meet the expectations that we've set for this restaurant.  Their dishes are always flavorful with what seems like minimal ingredients.  Tonight everything tasted like it was depending too much on sauces and salt to carry the flavor.  I don't know if there was a different chef, or the ingredients were cheaper, or what, but it tasted more like a meal we'd get at The Keg or Keegans (and we like those places, but Roy's is much more expensive and had always been worth that extra expense).  We started with the calimari.  The waiter did tell us that they'd changed the recipe slightly since we'd been there.  It was fine, but the previous way it was served was MUCH better, and we told the waiter so.  I had the greens with strawberries and goat cheese and, I swear, I think they actually salted this!  Not that there was salt in the dressing, but actual salt on the greens.  My entree was the butterfish.  It was fine.  Not outstanding, not sublime, just fine.  I've never had a \"just fine\" experience here and didn't finish my meal (also a first!).  My husband had the filet and poached lobster.  He asked for the steak to be cooked medium well and it was easily rare to medium.  It all had a sauce on it that seemed heavier (and served with a heavier hand than usual), so mostly you tasted sauce and not the usual delicious simplicity of the food.  The good news is our dessert, the pineapple upside down cake, was as delicious as it's always been, so the evening wasn't a total loss! :)    I really am curious if anyone else has noticed a difference or this really was an off night.  I'll be watching reviews to see if there's a downward trend.  I really hope not, this was always our favorite special night go-to restaurant.",

This particular Roy's stands out and is by far the BEST of them all!  They have a good menu and the food is always well prepared.  What puts this Roy's over the top is the exceptional and personalized service.  They really go out of their way to make you feel like a welcomed and valued guest.  The waiter made a few recommendations, which we didn't particularly enjoy, so after talking with us they immediately brought us something else that we absolutely loved.  This is a great example of really taking care of the customer and ensuring they have a positive experience.

We then had the Asian soft tacos which weren't personally my favorite however John loved them. I ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and originally when it came out it was super salty I could barely taste anything else at all. I let our waitress know and she was very quick to fix the issue and brought me out a whole new plate and it was amazing, nice, flaky, and moist it had great flavor. I had also ordered a side of the pesto risotto and that was tasty as well. John ordered the white truffle and black pepper sea scallops which were cooked to a perfect medium as he had asked also served with the risotto. Both meals were so good we had to force ourselves to stop eating just to save room for the pineapple upside down cake which was to DIE for. It was made fresh to order and served with homemade coconut ice cream(which I could of ate a whole bowl of alone lol) Overall I had a great experience here and while there was a little mishap with the mahi mahi at first they were quick to fix it and the manager even came by and apologized and took care of our dessert for us.",

The service, the food, the atmosphere was awesome.  We ordered the dumplings for the appetizer and they are the best we have ever had (and I've had A LOT of dumplings in my 36 years of life)!  I ordered the filet mignon and it came out perfect.  I order my steaks medium well, I know I know, everyone makes fun of me.  Thing is, my boyfriend orders his the same way.  Our steaks were perfect.  A tiny bit pink but the flavor was extremely tasty!  We asked for recommendations for cocktails and the waiter picked out some awesome ones.  He knew exactly what we were looking for.  Highly recommend this place!",

Didn't do much research about Roy's so when we walked in we immediately felt underdressed and quite out of place. But the service was fantastic. Our waiter was named Sean and he made the awkwardness go away immediately and made us feel welcome. He surprised us with our entrees and we were not disappointed. Great service and fantastic food. The manager TJ along with Sean made our awkward dinner turn into a night to remember with great food. Definitely will be back for more, just with a little more formal attire.",

    "text": "I had seen all the good reviews on Yelp so I expected a good meal at Roy's but I was still pleased at how good the food actually was.  The boyfriend and i hit up Roy's on a Friday night. We didn't have reservations so we were offered a table in the bar. The bar isn't very big but it was full so it was pretty loud. The noise was a tad distracting so I might try the dining room next time.  But other than that we had a nice time. I ordered a Mai Tai to drink and the Macadamia Nut Mahi Mahi for my entree. Boyfriend ordered the filet. The Mai Tai was yummy and rummy. Although a bit on the pricey side - $12. I did not order a second. My Mahi Mahi was served with new potatoes and gravy and asparagus. The fish was done perfectly and had a great texture and flavor. The potatoes were nice and tender and the asparagus was good too. The portion of the fish was quite large. Boyfriend's filet was tasty as well. Slightly more done than he likes it but not overdone. The steak comes with mashed potatoes (with bacon!) and broccoli. He did not hesitate in cleaning his plate.  For desert we ordered the chocolate lava cake. Maybe I was just too full but I found this to be a little underwhelming. The ice cream was more like frozen yogurt and while the cake was full of oozing chocolate it just didn't have that decadent chocolate taste I was hoping for.  Overall I was very happy with my night at Roy's. I would definitely go back.",

Our waitress was very good. She answered our menu questions and obviously knew the menu.  We started with the lobster potstickers (recommend).  I ordered a Hawaiian martini; husband ordered the Maui Mule.  Wished I had ordered the Maui Mule.  Salads were excellent, perfect sizes and tasty.  I ordered the fish trio, which was just the right-sized portions of the butterfish (highly recommend), mahi mahi (tasty) and salmon (so-so).  Husband ordered the swordfish (so-so) and wished he had ordered the butterfish.   We did order the souffle; however, if we'd known we'd be getting a complimentary brownie for our anniversary (delish!), we'd probably wouldn't have ordered the souffle.  All in all, a nice dining experience.  Our feedback:  Music: The music was too loud and not very classy.  Had a Denny's Restaurant feel.  Was expecting a classier decor.  Servers: As soon as we finished a final bite, the servers swooped in and removed our plates, making us feel rushed.  They even swooped away our desert plates and utensils, leaving us to use our fingers for the complimentary brownies. Not cool.  Food and cocktails were tasty. We'd go back.",

I was expecting Roy's to be sort of chainy and cheap, but it is incredibly classy and unique.  The atmosphere in Roy's is wonderful. Hawaiian meets mid-century modern. Love it. The wait staff was very attentive, and even when they messed up our order (more than once actually), they fixed it immediately so that it wasn't a problem at all. Everything arrived quickly, even though they had a huge party in the next room.  We split the fixed price menu and added an extra appetizer, although we really didn't need it! One order of the fixed price menu is enough for 2 people unless you've just hiked Camelback or something. We started with the calamari, which was perfectly done, and came with a macadamia nut bruschetta-like topping and a spicy dipping sauce. We also had the pork tenderloin on the fixed price menu. Very tasty, but the calamari was better. Our entree was the trout, which as I said was phenomenal. The desert was the cheesecake, which I thought was a little overly rich. But, still, this was the best meal I've had in Ahwatukee/Chandler,",

Some dishes are great and others are no better than a fast food Chinese place nearest 'anywhere America' - yes really.  Service: Always very good, never a complaint here expect when they did nothing when my dish was crappy. Did not comp the dish or even offer a desert... no, I did not even finish it.  When to Go: business dinners are the only time I use this place. If I spend my on cash, I go other places and get better food for the same $.",

    "text": "My quick summary: One of the best places I've been to eat, possible ever.  My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband had made the reservation online.  It was great because it asked if we had any allergies, so he could let them know ahead of time that I'm gluten free.  They also asked if we were celebrating anything special, so he let them know if was our anniversary.  As soon as we walked in the door and let them know our names, they immediately wished us a happy anniversary, and grabbed me a gluten free menu.  When we got to the table we found they had created personal menu inserts, congratulating us on our anniversay, brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, and let us know the chef had prepared for us an anniversary tasting menu (gluten free for me) if we wanted to go off the regular menu.  It was truly memorable.  The tasting menu was amazing, simply amazing.  The started with a shrimp & scallop appetizer.  Scallops are one of my favorite things, and this was cooked perfectly.  They brought us a small plate of steamed edemame, and the seasoning was super delicious.  The next course was ahi tuna poke.  It was a little spicy, but the cucumber and avacado they served it with toned it down and made it perfectly balanced.  We were then served butterfish bites.  I have to say, that is one of the best things I've ever eaten, hands down.  It served with a ginger glaze and a little wasabi.  I could have eaten a whole portion of that.  We also had a small salad of arugala, dates, panchetta, and a white balsamic dressing.  It was so light and refreshing.  All the flavors just exploded in your mouth.  The main course consisted of steak and a half lobster.  The lobster was buttery, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The steak was served with a red wine ver blanc.  The official dessert was their chocolate souffle, but as a surprise they served a mini dessert for us with chocolate cake and creme brulee.  They decorated the plate to say Happy Anniversay and took a complimentary picture for us.  Those mini desserts were divine.  Then came the souffle, I'd been eager to try it for about a week.  It did not disappoint.  The chocolate was rich, the inside was gooey chocolate goodness.  Between the experience of all the managers & our server catering to our anniversary and the amazing food, my husband and I are guaranteed to become regulars here.",

It is clean and has trendy decor, but the prices of the food and drinks don't add up to my satisfaction for the value.

    "text": "My wife and I came here for our Wedding Anniversary. We were half an hour early for our reservations, but they took it in stride. This may be the best service I've ever received from a restaurant staff. They were very into the \"special occasion\" and went WAY out of the way to make it special for us. They had their hands full, as the restaurant was busy, and I know there were at least 2 birthdays within earshot (no they don't sing to you). The food was FANTASTIC. We started with a spicy shrimp roll, it was VERY GOOD. My wife had the surf & turf (steak & lobster), she gave me a bite of both, and the steak may have been one of the tastiest steaks I've ever had. The lobster was also great, not overcooked, good flavor. I had ribs, done more like roast beef, it was also very good, a little \"fatty\", though that can be expected with ribs. I was also served something I'd never had before. It was like a hard boiled egg (yolk still runny - similar to over medium-like) then peeled, and fried like chicken... I had thought it was a hush-puppy or something similar, so I was surprised, but it was great! They gave us a free dessert, and a $20 gift card. We left with a great experience, bellies full & a framed picture of us that they took while we ate dessert. We will be recommending this place to our friends. Thank you for your wonderful service. I rated the food a 4/5 star, and that is probably harsh. The ribs were fatty, but still very good overall. I also rated the ambiance a 4/5 which I feel is fair. The tables are pretty close together, and the restaurant overall got pretty loud. It was a romantic ambiance, just loud. Everything else was worthy of 5 stars in my opinion.",

This beer is only priced at $3 during Happy Hour and a few select drinks at $7.  My GF decided to have Kahlua and Cream and that was $10 -- a little steep IMO.  Their Happy Hour menu is $7 per small dish; but with only 4 or 5 things on the menu you don't have much of a choice.  We had the Wagyu burger ($10), the ahi roll, and the crispy pork in steamed bun -- they were all good.  We ran up a bill of $60 and were going to leave and use our $20 gift card and were told that the gift card cannot be used for Happy Hour......WTF?  They never said that when we got the gift card as a kickback for spending more than $200 at Mother's Day!  So we had to buy an entree at $32 to use the gilft card.  So the net is that we spent $72 for Happy Hour.  Bottom line is Roy's is OK, but nothing special and their prices are high.  Make your own Happy Hour at some small bistro or some quaint Italian restaurant and it will probably be better and cheaper!",

When we arrived, we were greeted by multiple friendly employees and I believe even the manager, who was walking around to make sure things were running smoothly, it seemed! We got walked to our table and were soon greeted by our server Eric. He was so kind, and so friendly. He made sure we were taken care of!  We started off with the Sunshine sushi and omg! Tempora, yellowtail, salmon, avocado, rice cooked to perfection, YUM! It was the best sushi roll I've ever had in Arizona! My entree was the shrimp and fried rice and my wife got the braised beef. Each dish was incredibly delicious. The shrimp was fresh, juicy, and plump. The beef melted in your mouth! The entrees did not disappoint! Last, the dessert was pineapple upside down cake and oh my... Let's just say that was gone QUICK!    Overall, if you have a nice occasion and want to eat well, choose Roy's. It was one of the most pleasant experiences we've had and we can confidently say we'll be back!   A side note though, it is more on the fancy side so I was surprised to see people in T-shirts and flip flops.... Cmon people! It's fun to get dressed up every once in a while. Let's keep it classy!",

Flavorless.  The Mac and cheese had a gritty texture that was quite gross.  The fish itself was Amber Jack and quite overdone.  Would not go back anything other than the happy hour drinks. The food is utterly uninspired and bland. Which would possibly explain the lack of anyone under 60 in the restaurant at the time.  The bartender was excellent.",

    "text": "Even though Roy's is a nationwide chain, it's a pretty nice chain, built from the hard work of creator Roy Yamaguchi, whose Asian-fusion dishes embody the spirit of Hawaiian cuisine.    A nice perk of making reservations here online is that they offer 1000-point Opentable reservations for certain times and days.  This will put you half-way towards redeeming a gift certificate!    After we got seated and were poring through the menu, we received a plate of steamed edamame to snack on.  They were nicely seasoned with a sweet-salty-spicy mixture.  They currently offer a prix-fixe menu, where you get your choice of 1 out of 3 appetizers, entrees, and 1 out of 2 desserts for about $36.  Our waiter recommended a few a-la-carte items for our meal, which is what I ended up ordering (Go with what the experts know!).    I started with the lobster potstickers.  They had a nice crunchy pan-fried outer texture to contrast with the ginger-lobster filling.  The lobster was nice and tender, and had a delicate flavor that went pretty well with the sauce and glaze accompanying the dumplings.  My husband had ordered the prix-fixe menu, and decided on the citrus salad, which was served in a beautiful presentation, with bright, vibrant colors, and refreshing flavors.    As for the entree, I got the recommended misoyaki butterfish.  The butterfish was indeed a tender, buttery melt-in-your mouth texture.  The glaze seemed more heavy on the \"(teri)yaki\" side rather than the \"miso\" side, and as a result it was a bit too sweet for me.  There was a small bed of a pico de gallo type mixture on top of the fish which helped balance out the sweetness of the glaze somewhat, but I would have needed more of it to go with the rest of the fish since it was a limited amount.  The presentation was beautiful, as the darkly glazed fish was perched on top of a bed of bok-choy and forbidden black rice, surrounded by an emerald green wasabi sauce.  I also tried some of the prix-fixe pork shank, which was fall-off-the-bone tender, excellently seasoned with a lovely broth-like sauce.    We shared dessert, which was the chocolate souffle.  The molten dark chocolate in the souffle was nice, and the cold vanilla ice cream was a good complement to the deep, rich chocolatey hot souffle.  Service was a little sluggish, but friendly.  If you feel like splurging on a good meal, Roy's might be a good choice if you want an upscale Hawaiian experience in Arizona.",

    "text": "We came here almost 7 years ago and decided to come back to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The decor and ambiance inside is nice, the hostess greeted us quickly and showed us to our table and handed us our cloth napkins. For starters we ordered the calamari and the calamari itself was lacking seasoning on the batter, but the firecracker sauce definitely made up for it. It had an Asian flare and nice spicy kick. I ordered the filet mignon and what I got did not look nor taste like the filet mignons I've ever had before. It was a flat piece of meat that was overly charred and burned on the outside and covered up with some kind of weird sauce that didn't taste very good. My husband got the Roy's trio that came with ahi tuna, butterfish, and salmon with a side of rice. He didn't like the ahi and said it tasted funny and the other two fishes were just ok. Our server took forever to come back after we got out food to ask how things were and we wanted to ask for hot sauce and a redo if the steak but the time we waited for him to come back just wasn't worth it. The fries we ordered were nothing great. We saw on yelp pictures that other guests got really nice anniversary desserts and what we got was definitely not the same but I understand times change and it was better than nothing. Overall, nothing great and we probably won't come back.",

John (with ponytail) was our server, and was fun without being too over the top.   We all had various combinations of the shellfish and salmon, and all were perfectly cooked and flavorful. For dessert, you will want to try their flourless chocolate souffle. It has molten chocolate inside and vanilla ice cream, with a berry sauce. One of the best restaurant desserts I've had in a while. The atmosphere is a little noisy, but not so much that you can't have a conversation.   All-in-all, they did a great job!",

I ordered the Braised Short Ribs. Wow they were delicious, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  The mash that came with them was just as excellent and the broccolini and carrots were simple yet a nice touch.    We had mentioned we were there to celebrate an early birthday, and even though it still wasn't her bday Roy's still brought us a dessert and even took our picture from their camera and printed us a photo.     It's the little things that stand out the most and Roy's excelled in that area.  I highly recommend to everyone and I can't wait to go back.",

We ordered the canoe for two and the Poke Bowl along with the pineapple upside down cake and we loved it all tremendously.

Then this past Wednesday it turned out that both Mr. M and I were dressed nicely at the same time (usually I'm working from home in my \"Hoptimistic a cold beer is in my future\" t-shirt and some old shorts), and we decided to go to Roy's.  I have eaten at several different Roy's, but it's been a few years, and my Mr. had never been to one.    We started with the surf and turf app from the Chef's Selection menu and this was absolutely delicious.  Two grilled shrimp, cooked perfectly and slightly smoky.  Then there was a 3-4 oz. bacon-wrapped filet on top of a light potato puree.  Oh my.  If we go back anytime soon, I want one of those all to myself.  That disappeared very quickly.    We also ordered some cocktails and I had the Buffalo Trace Manhattan and he had the Rye Me a River.  Both very nice and well worth their 12 dollar price tag, but remind me to hit their happy hour sometime so I can afford to eat and drink here more often.  Then for our entrees my husband ordered the Himalayan sea salt ribeye off of the Chef's Selection menu and I ordered the Roy's Trio, which our server offered to make into a quad with the addition of the Ahi for $3.95.  Heck yeah!     We had decided not to take our phones in, and just talk and have a nice meal so I don't have any pictures of the main meal, but suffice it to say, it was all perfect.  The way they prepare the fish here is just amazing to me.  The ahi and the butterfish are so light they melt in your mouth, and the macadamia crusted mahi and salmon are so flavorful.  We also really enjoyed sharing the ribeye which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.    Our server, Anthony, was the most gracious host and when I mentioned we were sharing our food he brought a couple of clean plates right away so we could pass bites across the table, and was very prompt with drink refills.    We don't usually order dessert, and were too full to have the chocolate souffle or the pineapple upside down cake while we were there, but I thought it would be nice to take something home for later.  On the specials menu they had carrot cake listed and that always sounds appealing so I ordered a piece to go.  When I asked Anthony if they put whipped cream or anything on it, he said \"yeah, they put all kinds of cream and mango or pineapple something on it.....\"  I asked him if we could just get it plain and he said, \"Sure.\"  He got it all boxed up to go and put it in a bag to carry out.    When the bill came it was $140.21 before tip, as expected, so I was really glad I had the gift cards.  The only disappointment came when we got home, and I totally take the blame for this.    When I got home I decided to take a look at the carrot cake and was totally shocked I paid 9 bucks for 2- inch and a half square pieces of plain carrot cake.  See picture.  Nothing else.  No cream cheese frosting.  No nothing.  Ah I should have known.  A great deal of enjoying a meal at Roy's is the presentation.  I'm sure they take these 2 little squares and really doll them up.  9 bucks.  4 bites of cake.  Well, live and learn.  Next time I'll ask more questions or look in the box before I take it out of the restaurant.  Overall, I would definitely go back to Roy's sooner rather than later.",

I had the sea bass which was mushy and appetizers weren't so great. The egg rolls were soggy, lobster dumplings were good, ribs were good and tender and calamari was bland.

    "text": "I was really excited to come here for Restaurant Week and I was not disappointed!  The restaurant is beautiful and you are greeted by a huge fish tank with exotic fish near the hostess stand.  Feels like a little bit of Hawaii!  I did not know this place would be so \"intimate\" as in dimmed overhead lighting with candles on each table.  It would make a great place for a special date night.  As for the food, I tried the tempura ahi tuna roll appetizer, the short ribs entree, and the lemon blueberry cheesecake.  My favorite was definitely dessert!  The cheesecake was thick and creamy with a sweet graham cracker crust and topped with lots of whipped cream and TONS of blueberries.  The ahi roll was good, although I would have liked it even better if it had not been fried and had just been a regular roll.  The short ribs were also good and very tender, but sooo rich and fatty.  I know that's what you should expect with short ribs, but it was almost to the point of being TOO rich.  And the flavoring/marinade on it was a bit strong and salty.  I think it would be good with a lot of bland potatoes or something to balance it out.  It did come with a mashed potatoes side, but not enough to counter all the strong flavor and fats from the short ribs.  I also like that they offer online reservations, makes it so simple and easy to plan your night out.",

The cocktails are great, fruity just as I like them.  The wagu roll was good but it needed an element of crunch and some acidity. The lobster dumplings were rich but felt like they were missing something.  I ordered the butterfish. Our server totally sold me on it because it's what their known for, but I didn't like it. The coconut milk was overpowering. The fish was executed perfectly, but all I tasted was sweetness. Way too much sweetness.  The partner ordered the scallops and they were good but the park belly was more fatty than crunch. The fennel greens seemed out of place and didn't blend well with the other flavors. It definitely needed something else to make the marriage work.  Dessert was ok. The lemon was a nice zing to a one note meal.",

The food was amazing, and service was much more the norm.   We came to the special Roy Yamaguchi dinner and wine pairing. It was fabulous. Roy made an appearance and was so nice. He took pics with those of us taking part in the special dinner pairing, as well as the regular dining crowd. That was a great treat. Best of all, we had the special happy anniversary dessert. Loved it! Thanks.   Old:  So, I still enjoy coming here - mostly. And I wish I could do 31/2 stars. But I've not been as happy with the service. It was our 21st anniversary at our most recent visit...and no flowers on table (at first), no card, no special treat - we used to get a mini dessert with happy anniversary on the plate. Even the upside down pineapple cake didn't have happy anniversary on the plate. Super disappointing. Good food and cocktails overall, though. But my rare filet was more medium rare. Our waiter didn't check back to make sure all was good before we were mostly finished. And we got a frown when we tried to use a $20 off coupon. Hopefully next time will be better for the amount paid.",

For the price of any entree you get a three course meal.  The shrimp dumpling appetizer was okay, not great but tasty.  The alternative \"surf n turf\" with prawns and pork loin was bleeping deliciousness in my mouth.  The plate was beautiful and everything (absent the cold tomato side) had a purpose on the plate.

When it came time for out main entrees, we were so pleased with our choices. I ordered the Filet Mignon, which came with a bernaise sauce, grilled asparagus, and cheesy mashed potatoes. YUM! My husband had the butterfish with forbidden rice. So delicious, melt in your mouth, sweet, absolutely perfect. We normally don't order dessert, but we splurged and ordered the pineapple upside down cake. It came with a side of homemade coconut ice cream. My hubby is normally repulsed by all things coconut, but he devoured it! Truly one of the best date nights we ever went on. The service, from the host to our server to the front of house manager, was all stellar. We will without a doubt come back here in the near future.",

We finished with the chocolate souffle and were so full but it was so good we had to finish it. Our server Kim was great! She was very attentive and helpful without being too \"in your face\". We definitely want to go back. It was a special occasion for us, otherwise we would not have paid so much for a night out. But the food was definitely worth the price. I told my husband that this is my new birthday dinner place (hopefully he listens )",

We were seated right away, our Anniversary was recognized by the server and with a special dessert! Our server Stacy was fantastic! The food was wonderful! For appetizers we had a surf and turf and the lobster pot stickers. Oh my goodness! Our main course was divine! My husband had their 3 seafood special with lobster and shrimp.  I had the Crab Dynamite Broiled Barramundi which was recommended by Stacy and both of us were thrilled.  We only chose this place because we had received a gift card, it will however become our new go to restaurant!",

    "text": "I first became aware of Roy and his restaurants four years ago while watching season 2 of \"Top Chef.\"  At the time I was planning my first visit to Hawaii, and I was specifically avoiding Oahu and making a beeline for the Big Island so the final competitions on the Big Island captured my fancy.  Roy was a major judge in the competition.  The loss of my job nearly four years ago caused a major shift in priorities for me, as in no more trips to Hawaii anytime soon. Ditto for dining on haute cuisine.   Somehow I stumbled onto the website for Roy's and learned about the Aloha menu.  With a five dollar price ceiling for drinks and food, I reckoned I could once again sample food that was the culinary equivalent of transcendence without feeling guilty about the expenditure afterwards. So, I cajoled my meat and potatoes Midwestern beau into taking me to Roy's for an early light meal and cocktails.  From the moment we walked in the door, everything was perfect and professional- very professional. I should know, once upon a time I made my living in haute cuisine restaurants. I've always said it's easy to find great food for a commensurate price, the trick is getting great food without a hefty pricetag. Aloha hour at Roy's affords a person such as myself the opportunity to experience innovative cuisine and cocktails without forfeiting a necessity of life such as electricity for a month.  Getting back to the staff, we were greeted and treated as if we had arrived in a limo instead of a Tundra. Once seated in the bar for Aloha hour we were not subjected to thinly veiled contempt from the server who realized that the tab was not going to merit the same gratuity as a several course meal.  The hostess, our server, and the manager on duty were  all extremely cordial, polite and provided seamless service and even better food.    The original hawaiian martini I ordered was prepared with top shelf liquors, not cheap substitutes to reflect the reduced price.  We loved the salt and pepper calamari, Waygu sliders, potstickers, and the sushi rolls with a spin.  For a fraction of the price of the average degustation menu we sampled the gamut of appetizers and several drinks- well, I had several drinks, not the driver.  As for ambiance, we were seated at a banquette adjacent to a very large marine fish aquarium.  The atmosphere was subdued, urbane, comfortable and the staff was attentive, accommodating, and knowledgeable. Since we were on a date at the time, the server offered to take our photo. It was presented to us in a paper frame shortly afterward.  That is a ready indicator of the staff's desire to go above and beyond percentage-motivated tasks for guests.    Kudos to Roy for bringing the True spirit of Aloha to the mainland along with his unique fushion cusine in a sophisticated atmosphere that reflects warmth and the highest level of professional service for guests regardless of the bottom line at the end of the meal.",

The waiters were very attentive...like putting a napkin on my lap, refreshing water practically after each sip, walking me to the restroom, clearing plates as soon as we were done...like that. So we had lobster pot-stickers to start out with. It had a butter demi-glaze sauce (I believe) that had a spice to it and i don't think I can have any pot-sticker ever again that will be as good as this. These were so good! Second course I got filet mignon and the boyfriend had short ribs. Both excellent, cooked to perfection and came with buttery mashed potatoes, brocolini and small carrots. Seriously...the potatoes were amazing. I kept dipping the veggies in it to enhance their flavor.  Dessert choice was a chocolate souffle for me and a cheesecake with blueberry sauce for the boyfriend. All in all, best service, best food and wonderful experience that I've ever had. Need to try this place again....the pot-stickers alone make it worth while.",

I ordered the lobster fillet. The lobster was really good  Now the negative the fillet was awful just disgusting. It was way too much pepper there was no flavor only pepper. I highly recommend staying away from the fillet mignon. You might regret if you ordered it. That's why I'm giving it two stars. I asked the waitress and she said that they haven't changed the seasoning. So not sure if I'm coming back or not.",

Again, we started with the Crunchy Golden Lobster Potstickers, the best I have had.  For the main dish I had the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish, which literally melted in my mouth.  Was delicious!  I am usually not one to eat \"everything\" on my plate, but left nothing here.  They had asked us if we were celebrating anything special while they seated us, so we let them know it was our anniversary. They brought out to us a plate of mini desserts to have and offered to take a picture for the occasion.  We also had ordered some dessert.  There was nothing left when we were done and left completely satisfied.  I cannot wait to return for more great food!",

Then...come back for dinner sometime when you feel like throwing down some serious cash for some seriously good eats.  I took a friend there last night as a \"thank you for watching my dog while I was on vacation dinner\" (her choice but I was totally IN) and she was SO happy! We started with cocktails: the Mango Mojito was nice but expensive but I REALLY enjoyed the equally pricey Coconut Frappe off the \"Lifestyle--Under 150 calories\" Menu. That little taste of cinnamon was inspired! And the sweetness really set off the salted/garlic edamame which is complimentary (such a nice alternative to bread, which always fills you up too much to enjoy your meal, no?).  We then proceeded to taste everything on each other's plates so I can personally attest to their 3-course Prix Fixe menu (app/entre/dessert for $37)--she chose the Pan-Seared Trout over Black Couscous (not fishy at all, a bit dry for my taste), the Dim Sum (which was nice but I needed a bit more of the Shiso Herb Puree, which was deelish), and of course the Chocolate Souffle (perfectly rich!). I opted for the Trio, which was on a Yelp special for 30% off ($24 instead of $36, yay! more $ for cocktails!) and featured a sampling of 3 of their most popular fish dishes: the Teriyaki Grilled Salmon (yum), the Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi (double yum!) and the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish (triple yum!!). I can't believe I ate it all! And that's after splitting a Grilled Pear Salad w/ spicy walnuts and blue cheese (dressing was divine!)...whew!  In addition to all this gastric happiness we experienced, our service (from greeter/hostess to waiter to table-busser) was wonderful. Attentive, prompt, suggestive and friendly.   A wonderful evening!",

The group favorite here is the prix fixe menu, which gets you three courses. The entrees have varied - the last time I was there only one fish option was listed as the entree. (This is odd for a Hawaiian fusion place.) The short ribs I had instead where quite good, however.  The bar crew here is very good, and they make a killer mojito. No beer on tap, though, which is disappointing. (A nice draft Sapporo would go quite well with the fish.)

He would ask the requisite questions, but always with a disdainful look on his face. He also seemed irritated that we didn't order any drinks, and he all but snatched our wine glasses away.   Specifically, a few other things stand out among the general attitude of displeasure he displayed. We ordered the mango streusel dessert (from the prix fixe menu), and he brought out a pineapple dish and called it \"apple pecan... eh... thing.\" We didn't realize it was the wrong dessert until we dug into it, so we didn't say anything. Then, when it was time to pay, we wanted to use two gift cards plus a credit card to cover his tip. We had some confusion about how to do this, and he seemed really impatient when we asked questions. Then, when we said we would think about how we wanted to split things up, he backed away with his hands up and stomped away. Lastly, when we had paid and wanted to double check that we had properly written everything out on the receipt, he just snapped, \"That's fine.\" Again, I didn't expect him to fawn over us, but considering that we were trying to tip him (generously, might I add, given his rudeness throughout the night), he could have shown a little patience or at least said thank you.   I want to give the server the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was having a bad day, but it's really a shame that the good food and atmosphere were tainted by his unpleasant behavior. Next time my family wants to enjoy a nice dinner, we will probably choose a restaurant where we can expect a server who doesn't sneer at us.  ***  Edit: The manager saw my original review (above) and called to get more feedback. This impressed me and showed that Roy's really cares about its customers, and Emiliano was nothing but courteous and understanding when I spoke with him. He even sent a $50 certificate for our next visit. I really appreciate that he reached out and will be sure to try Roy's again soon.",

One of the best things about this chain is the consistency in the high excellence of food and service.  We love Roy's, we've been going here for a long time.  I would recommend it just about anyone, even the fussy eaters.  If you are a chocolate lover, make sure to try their chocolate lava cake.  You have to order it along with your dinner as it takes about 30 minutes to make.",

    "text": "For the price; definitely not worth a visit  I would definitely not return to this restaurant; although based on other reviews I might try one in a different city.  The service was not good.  We were seated by a very inexperienced host and our main waitress seemed to be very new and moved from \"stalking us\" to ignoring us for long periods of time.  In addition, the food was good but not up to par with the prices.  I had the seafood sampler and the lobster was on par to something you would get at Red Lobster (it was small and overcooked)-seriously.  My husband had the seafood quad (not on the menu) and said all of the fish (except the tuna which was served raw) was overcooked.  We did enjoy the beef spring rolls; although the presentation was really odd...they looked like three soggy cigars when they came out; but they were delicious.  Finally we had the chocolate desert that you have to order ahead...I had one bite; it was not worth the calories.  We did enjoy the wine...Fess Parker Ashley but we found by the second bottle that we needed to move it to the other side of the booth because our waitress kept over pouring our glasses...it was crazy.   Anyway, hope you have a better experience.",

The food, however, was just ok. Especially for the price.  My beef lacked flavor and was a little tough. the lettuce wraps were good, but not amazing.  The ice cream served witht eh souffle was generic and lacked vanilla flavor.",

We didn't have a reservation and we're treated like that was not acceptable but they would try to fit us in, it would be a few minutes. We watched at least three parties leave and one go in while we waited over 30 minutes with no communication from the staff. Very rude! Will not go back. We went across the way to Z'tejas and we're taken right in. The food at Z'Tejas  was great and we had very good service!",
