    "text": "Having walked all of Scottsdale during our 2.5 hour wait for a table, I understand that this is the upscale restaurant in the area. Not many other choices for a dressy date night, work dinner, or the like. Still, it's not worth the wait, or really any wait. I didn't mind the wait so much, but the hostess was either disingenuous or grossly mistaken about when our table would be ready. Protip for hostesses: don't tell people they are next or point to a specific table as theirs if you intend to seat other people in front of them.   As for the meal, the cornbread was passable. Dry on the outside, a little doughy on the inside, and overwhelmingly jalapeno flavored, though not spicy. The house salad was simple, but good, and I especially liked the deviled egg on the side, which was quite tasty. The service was friendly and efficient, and she kept my water and soda glasses full, so that's a plus. Overall, I can't see any reason why I'd eat here again.",

    "text": "Tonights vacation dinner destination was Bandera, located in Old Town Scottsdale. We heard lots of good reviews for Bandera, and were excited to try it. Bandera is also a sister restaurant to Houstons and The Rutherford Grill (both 5-star ratings from me).  We got there about a half hour earlier than our reserved time, and enjoyed a drink and the Deviled Egg app on the patio. Our table was ready in no time. We ordered the Grilled Artichoke and Cornbread sides...the artichoke was fantastic. The cornbread was the best I've ever had. For my main course, I ordered the Steak and Enchilada. The 6oz filet was sliced into three small pieces and had a maroon spicy sauce on the side. The enchilada had their signature rotisserie chicken inside. Both were tasty.  The wifey had the Macho Salad. The salad arrived and for whatever reason, it was missing the rotisserie chicken. They quickly corrected it, and she enjoyed it quite a bit.  I liked Bandera, but it was a touch off. Maybe it has something to do with the Mexican fusion? Good, but not as good as their sister restaurants. 4-stars.",

    "text": "I went to Bandera when I first moved to AZ a few times and enjoyed it... and then a few years passed and I didn't really think about it.  But then all of a sudden, Bandera was on my mind.  I needed to go back!  Perhaps I was craving that cornbread or that warm atmosphere that I remembered, but for the past few weeks, I've been suggesting Bandera to whomever I'm eating with so I could return.  I saw Bandera at Noche De Gourmet, and that just put it in my head even more.  So finally, this past Sunday night, I convinced my dining companions to go to Bandera!  It was around 7:30pm... it was me, Jared, my parents, and Joan M (my mother-in-law).  We'd all worked up an appetite watching my brother complete in IronmanAZ.  We arrived at Bandera and luckily, there was no wait.  I ordered the cornbread and grilled artichoke as appetizers for the table.  A few of us enjoyed a bottle of wine.  Our server was really sweet although perhaps a bit annoyed when my dad attempted to special order the sides that came with his fish.  My mom had the meatloaf, I had the Macho Salad, J had the rotisserie chicken, and Joan had a Caesar Salad and side of brussel sprouts.  While I really enjoyed the appetizers and wine, my meal was not all that... On the menu, the Macho Salad is described \"with Roasted Chicken, Avocado, Chopped Almonds and Goat Cheese.\" I ordered it without the almonds but it had some other surprises in there as well including cornbread croutons and dates.  Don't get me wrong - i like those things but I also like to know ahead of time what I'm getting!  The salad was huge and could've easily fed two of us.  Everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals.  I know a lot of people compare Bandera to Houston's (and they are both under the Hillstone Restaurant Group umbrella), but I have to say, I think the food at Houston's is much better!  I will no longer be craving Bandera's food... but perhaps I'll return for just their cornbread!",

They had whole chickens cookibg rotisserie style that you could see and smell from outside, creating a wonderful aroma. Our server Megan was very polite and good looking. She was quick with the refills and made sure we had everytjing we needed. We had an appetizer of the corn bread, which was great. The rest of our food was brought out surprisingly quickly. I had the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken was maybe the best I have ever had anywhere! So tender and juicy! The mashed potatoes were very good too! My brothers both had the rib and chicken combo and loved it. They preferred the chicken to the ribs, but liked both. I had some over their fries, which were delicious and the corn on the cob looked very good. Everything there was great! Highly recommended for a nice dinner",

I enjoy Bandera for dinner because it's cozy inside and filled with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant without making it uncomfortable for customers. I like this atmosphere because we can have a nice dinner for two and be in our own element but it's not quiet either. Nothing's worse than being in a dead silent restaurant where the staff is lurking around waiting to hear your conversation.   Now moving on to the food side of the evening. I have two words: southwestern cornbread. Oh my...I could eat the entire skillet, but I contained myself and just had a corner of it. It's filled with jalapeno, and chunky corn throughout the bread. It's amazing. It's so amazing, it didn't even need butter. That's a sign of good bread. I had the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious but ginormous.   In summary, I have Bandera on my rotation for great dinner spots when it's time to make it a night out but without making it a huge deal.",

The Chilean sea bass was absolutley one of the top 3 things I have eaten in my life  I almost ate it all, and it was my wife's.   We had read reviews about the cornbread skillet so we ordered it. It was huge and only $5 so you can't lose. It was so good it didn't need any butter or honey with it.   Our server was attentive and helpful.  First, the hostess was able to find us in the crowd without a vibrating coaster or annoying intercom system.  Our waitress was able to transfer our bar tab to our dinner ticket which made things easier.   The atmosphere is loud because of the number of people but very professional.

If anything, I would say that Bandera is almost a victim of its own success and is maybe slightly too busy, if anything - but maybe I'm just bitter because I didn't get the chance to linger longer over the amazing meal.  Definitely the best place to grab a bite in old town Scottsdale!",

You'll feel relaxed there, the waiters are so genuine and friendly that it seems like they really care about you.  I am always skeptical about having rotisserie chicken for dinner because I could live with Boston Market's anyway, but this one is so much better than any others I've tried.  The restaurant is roomy and dark but it's quiet enough to carry a good conversation with friends (in my case it's my boss.)  I greatly recommend this restaurant if you are in Scottsdale and want to eat chicken.",

A friend took me for my birthday, and I was surprisingly let down. The place really is too stiff for a rotisserie (as a fellow poster noted), and I think the prices are exceedingly high for mid-level food. Portions were small, and the staff was a little too formal for my taste. I don't plan to return.",

They have a fantastic basil martini that is always worth trying not to mention a great wine list.  I was there last weekend with my mom; she had the ribs - which literally were falling off the bone delcious and I had the meatloaf.  The meatloaf was running a little late and the chef came out to apologize.  Afterwards, he came back to see how it was and I told him I wanted the recipe.  He took 5 mins out of his BUSY shift to explain to me how to make it and I really appreciated that.  Also the fries are soo good!  Bandera - I love you.",

Over the years, I have been to various Bandera restaurants numerous times and the food and service are always, consistently good.  Bandera is definitely a place to \"see and be seen\" -- and is especially popular with a fairly well-heeled crowd of folks who drive 7-series BMW's and wear fancy gold Rolex's.  The bar also has the reputation of a world-renown cougar pickup joint --  But, if you can get past the obvious pretentiousness the food and atmosphere are always excellent.    The to-die-for Veggie Burger and Chicken Enchiladas are stand-out good items on the menu.  A dedicated meat lover -- the Bandera Veggie Burger is hearty enough to stand it's own against any steak sandwich.  Get braised cabbage with goat cheese as your side and you won't be sorry!  The grilled artichoke appetizer is also very good, albeit overpriced for what you get: a split artichoke with a tiny cup of very good aoli sauce.   Overall, a very good meal, for a reasonable cost.",

The hostess was busy seating other guests so one of the managers saw us and seated us immediately.  He asked us if we've eaten here before and when we told him we were from out of town he took the time to tell us what was good on the menu.  His (Luke) recommendations were on point!  I had the chicken and green rice platter, my husband had the tri-tip and enchilada platter.  He also recommended their house margaritas which is made fresh!  They were the best margaritas I have ever had.  We had an awesome server, Danny.  He knew when to approach us and not to approach us.   To top it off this restaurant is in a little area called Old Town Scottsdale.  What an adorable area!  Make sure to visit this area and go eat at Bandera!",

Pleasantly surprised that the restaurant had a dresscode, which is fairly uncommon nowadays.   Only issue was finding parking due to the nearby SF Giants game, but eventually found a spot within a couple of blocks of our destination.  Walking into Bandera immediately reminded us of the old Houston's on Park Avenue South in NYC.   Same subdued lighting and dark wood booths surrounding a vibrant bar scene.   Soon learned that the Hillstone Restaurant Group which runs the Bandera chain also manages Houston's, thus the many similarities.  Menu choices were sufficient to please even picky eaters. Terrific wine and beer and specialty cocktail list.  For a chain restaurant, service, food and value were uniformly excellent across the board. Menu choices were sufficient to please even picky eaters.",

    "text": "My father's friend recommended Bandera as a dining location during our family's pilgrimage to Scottsdale. It's a popular restaurant - when we called up at 5:00pm to make a same-day reservation, the earliest available table was at 9:15pm. We decided to wait for a table instead, and were seated in about 45 minutes.  A quick perusal of the menu told me that it was a Hillstone-owned restaurant: there's the \"macho salad\", a butternut and cheddar enchilada, homemade Oreo sandwich, etc. This was a bit disappointing as I've dined at a couple of Hillstones elsewhere and was hoping for a more original dining experience. But since we were there, we ordered:  Grilled Artichoke (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#NXGmm9uLQ9DrIYJSSJffMw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/band...</a>): 4/5 Who doesn't love a nicely-grilled vegetable? This was nice and crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside, and served with a good remoulade dip. They serve this at every Houston's and is an appetizer I'll always order.  Skillet Cornbread (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#sd27YFMBnR2nFa0P4FY2og\">yelp.com/biz_photos/band...</a>): 2.5/5 Another Houston's staple. There is much less cornmeal in this than in most versions of cornbread, and it's quite heavy on the butter. This combination makes for a heavy, non-cakey cornbread, which I actually prefer but will leave traditionalists a bit disappointed. You'll find corn kernels and jalapenos baked into it.  Crispy Chicken Sandwich (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#p25rQpHnyaxrdxQu8feqXQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/band...</a>): 1.5/5 I had this at Honor Bar in Beverly Hills and LOVED it. Unfortunately, this was quite disappointing. The chicken breast was flavorless in addition to being fried too long so that the overly-crispy batter was falling off. There wasn't enough moisture in the sandwich overall to combat a heavy-tasting bread; the kale slaw was really lacking in vinaigrette and there was none of the delicious honey aioli I remembered from the previous time I ordered this dish. It didn't get finished.  Bandera-Style Roasted Chicken (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#Cc7HeytW61mGJIjsOjzuSQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/band...</a>): 2.5/5 I guess there's only so much you can do with rotisserie chicken, but this wasn't a huge step up from what you can get at El Pollo Loco for far cheaper. While the 1/2 chicken was moister, it was prepared with the same paprika and onion powder rub. The accompanying rice looked fantastic, but was ultimately very bland and herbed with parsley rather than cilantro.  Banana Cream Pie (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bandera-scottsdale?select=-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ#-eniIDlsW7sIOR6YOF2sAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/band...</a>) 1/5 The only thing \"banana\"-y about this dessert were the fat slices on the plate. The pie itself had none. The custard wasn't flavored with anything (no vanilla, no banana, no nothing!) but was just your standard thickened egg yolk. And the whipped cream had no sugar or other sweetener mixed into it and was completely bland. This was less than half-eaten between 3 adults.  We were a bit disappointed with our dinner and won't return in future visits to Scottsdale. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who has been to another Hillstone/Houston's in the past.",

Smoky, sweet peppers inside gave the bread amazing crumbly texture and flavor, which is a feat to behold as that dish is so easy to make bland & unappetizing. For my entree I had the Carnitas sandwich which came with fries. The sandwich is absolutely enormous and I could only eat half as it was so messy & filling. Unfortunately, the fries added nothing special to the dish. They were limp & seasoned unevenly. My friends had the Rotisserie Chicken & Meatloaf which they both said were excellent. We all shared the brussel sprouts which were also enormous. The aioli accompanying them was delicious, however I prefer my brussel sprouts to be crispy throughout & bite-sized. Bandera is a solid 4 star restaurant and I'll be back again ordering the cornbread, just not the sandwich or sprouts.",

The food and atmosphere are top notch, but if an broke don't fix it. Recipes going down hill when changed.  Also, first time with two small children at the restaurant and it's not very child friendly for obvious reasons.",

It would be a shame for you to skip over this place as its in a touristy location. This is outstanding dining and service.  I've spent quite a few years in Chicago and have experienced my fair share of smoked salmon. The smoked salmon app, smoked in house at Bandera was mindblowing. The delicate flavor of the smoke wasn't overpowering and mingled nicely with the fish. There were no bones, and the texture was just flakey and smooth. This was as fresh as it gets and beyond even the finest deli's smoked salmon. Bandera pairs this with a brilliantly executed twist on a caesar dressing. It's a mayo with anchovy paste, lemon juice, black peppers and scallions. I'm trying to recreate this delicious sauce right now. I guarantee I will be back for a lagunitas IPA and this thoughtful appetizer.   For my main, I had the rotisserie chicken. This was seasoned in a light cajun rub and perfectly cooked. I loved how tender everything was. The scallion mashed had an oddly high ratio of scallions, but I enjoyed it. The moisture level was just perfect with this meat.  Another interesting standout was a home made cabbage, this anti-crout had some firmness and was served with goat cheese. Weird but memorable.  Service was spot on, you may have to dress up to get in to this place. Pacing between courses was as it should be and the wait staff was knowledgeable. While bandera is on the pricy side, its not unfair. Your looking at 17$ for the chicken, and 14 for the smoked salmon which fed 2 people. I can't afford to eat here all the time, but my mind keeps wandering to that legendary smoked salmon app. I'll just turn it in to a lunch!",

I saw a gentleman with a great looking salad  that I figured had to be a specialty salad but that was not the case, it was the house salad and it was also really good.

I ordered the macho salad and my wife had the BBQ salmon.  She loved her meal and I was extremely happy with the macho salad.  While the dish was 25% smaller than previous visits, it was perfect.  I could never finish the salad before so a little less was fine by me.  Most importantly, the mix of ingredients was spot on.  The chicken was tender and plentiful and this time there was avocado, tomato, goat cheese, dates, corn, etc. all mixed to perfection.  I will definitely put Bandera back on my very short \"go to\" list of Restaurants in Scottsdale.",

Seated promptly, server arrived to take our drink order within one minute after being seated.  Drinks came out promptly.  Nice selection of beers on draught and a reasonable wine list - not great, but adequate.  Server was attentive throughout the meal, although she did not ask me if I wanted another beer or if my wife wanted another Margarita.  WE would not have ordered a second drink, but the server did not know that.  One should always be asked - revenue generator.  The food is delicious and well presented.  Pricing is as follows:  my wife's salmon dish, probably about 5-6 ounces of fish, was $28, her Margarita was $12, her dessert, a cheesecake dish, was $8.  My beer was $5 and my pork sandwich was $17, I think.  I must say that the \"home cut\" fries accompanying my sandwich were a bit of a disappointment, cut very much like shoestring potatoes, very thin and short.  I prefer my fries a bit more on the meaty side.  The ambiance is quite good, very pleasant.  Although on one website the restaurant more than hints about one's cell phone etiquette, suggested elimination of baseball caps, (particularly if one has not even a modicum of couth and wears the cap backwards like an ill bred, redneck slob), and general standard of dress, I still did see some men in the restaurant with shorts and t-shirts, generally against the restaurant's published dress code.  If you are going to publish a dress code, at least have the courtesy to those of us who follow it to enforce it as your web site says you will do.  Overall I would probably go again.  Bringing children to the restaurant is also strongly discouraged -Hallelujah!!!!!!!!!!!",

I did order the Prime rib which was beyond expectation. Salty crispy outside and a juicy (medium) inside. The mashed potatoes were so flavorful. I loved the main dish and ended up with Oreo Sandwiches for desert.  My dinner was lovely.",

After waiting an hour to get our table, It took a another hour to get my appetizer order in. The service was not attentive. I flagger down a server from another section to get some water for me because it took over a half an hour to get my drink, after our cornbread had been delivered to the table. The manager came over and assured me she be right back with my drink after apologizing for running out of artichokes as I watched the table across me eat an artichoke.  My drink was never delivered by the manager and my friend finished his drink before I got mine.  It took about an hour to order our main entrees ordered and by the time we finished it was nearly 10:45 p.m.  I just feel like the entire night was substandard, and if I am going to go to Bandera I have higher expectations.  Unbelievable",

Historically, the service is unparalleled. However, as of late, it seems things have gone downhill in that department. Sometimes we'll have amazing service, but other times we giggle at how terrible the service was. The food and drinks make up for EVERYTHING - hence the 5-star review.   The one thing that really does irk me and other guests and friends we've spoken to is the hostesses. My goodness! Those ladies sure know how to stare someone down and make them feel uncomfortable. I honestly can't recall a single time where I've felt welcomed. Hoping that changes over time with the seemingly revolving door of management.",

They are well known for their rotisserie chicken as that is there staple.  It's a must get if you are big into country chicken and potatoes.  But my all time favorite is the burger, I am big burger guy so if you are looking to spend a little more than the average burger this is where you should spend the extra dollar.  The only reason I provided the 4 stars was because they are always busy especially on the weekend.  The staff is not to favorable when it comes to walk ins.  If you do plan to go to Bandera I highly recommend using the reservation app, because of you don't it will be an hour and half wait at the LEAST.",

We started with the grilled artichoke with lemon aioli dipping sauce (phenomenal). She got the bangers and mash and I got the rotisserie chicken. Presentation was nice, speed was excellent and taste was amazing!   Drinks were good, with a suitable selection and to top it off, the banana cream pie was delicious!   Overall, great service and food! This place gets busy and it's easy to see why. If you okay spending a little bit more, it's well worth the price...every bite of it...",

The kale and peanut side salad is so amazing also.  I know, Its alot of food, but we cant resist the amazing party that takes place in your mouth.

For the entrees, it's hard to find anything that isn't delicious. I've had the macho salad, bangers and mash, prime rib, and rotisserie chicken...none will disappoint. They've got a great selection of wine and beers as well. I've only had dessert a couple of times but both were excellent. One was a nut crust pie and the other was creme brulee.

The portions are not huge and shareable.   We had an issue where there were black specs in the water (maybe a filter issue?). At first we thought they were bugs but after asking for new water and getting it again, we realized it must've been the whole supply. They seemed too busy to really care or address this so unfortunately the 8 of us just went without water.   We aren't dying to go back, but would return sometime in the future because the food and atmosphere are great",

The cornbread and rotisserie chicken are the best I've ever had anywhere, and they definitely know how to cook a steak. The ribeye is super tender. The atmosphere is sort of upscale relaxed, so you feel taken care of but still casual. Only one time did we have a slight service issue at the beginning of the meal, and it wasn't that big of a deal, but they still went above and beyond all expectations to make it right and give us an awesome experience. I will absolutely keep coming back here.",

The wine list literally doesn't have any bad choices on it especially when paired with their duo dip.  When in Scottsdale this is a stop worth making...twice.",

    "text": "Off My List For Good  This is a place I either used to go to, or order take-out from several times a month for years. I loved that if I didn't feel like getting dressed to go out, I could drive up and they would bring my food right to my car - so yes, convenience was a factor.  It is still convenient, but for the value, the prices have gotten awfully high over the years.   Many of the items that I came to love on the menu have been modified to the point of not hitting the mark with me anymore, or have been removed. When I ask about the modified items, I am told that they have not been changed, but I've been dining there longer than most of their staff has been working there. I have tried newly added items over time, but I just don't care for them, not limited to, but especially the fried items. They are all way too heavy.  Maybe I'm a throw back, but I would like to have the same Macho Salad, with the same dressing that I enjoyed in 2001. I would like to see house smoked salmon on the menu all of the time. It is on the menu of all of the other 4 Banderas across the country, why not here? I really miss the grilled lamb sirloin.  To give them credit, the rotisserie chicken is wonderful. At least they haven't changed that, and at least they have stopped serving it in that awful puddle of tortilla sauce which you had to remember ask them to leave off the plate once they started serving it that way.  Between their prices, unpleasantly shifting menu, and the absence of my favorites, I give up. Although service is ok, I want to go somewhere where they have food I can enjoy.",

So good.   Coleslaw is also  winner, spicy but not overpowering. A must try.   The meh: Chicken while tasty didn't knock my socks off. We had just had El Pollo Loco last night and don't see much difference between the two.   Green rice, hmm really lacking flavor. Skip it and sub Coleslaw.   Service was overall very good. Staff was very friendly. We did receive our food rather quickly, which didn't make for a relaxing meal. Timing could have been better.   Overall it is a good place. 5 stars no, but a solid 4.

On arriving we were accosted by a really drunk guy who was completely abusive and spewing nonsense about \"the rich fu%^ers who live in Scottsdale\". Now, Bandera can't control fools on the street but this guy was hanging out with an employee who was working the rotisserie/takeout window. Not a good 1st impression at all.  The person I was with was in a deviled egg mood - not something I'd generally order but the Bandera version was quite tasty. My Macho salad was amazing - goat cheese, almonds,  some sort of dried fruit and fresh chicken. I asked for the dressing on the side and they dutifully omitted it, but never brought the side - however the salad was plenty good without it.  Everything was delivered to the table quickly but we weren't really checked back on (see: no salad dressing above) and they never bothered to refill drinks. That said, for a chain Bandera was above average in the food department.",

We put our name on the wait list for a table in case the bar failed to clear out which is what happened.  We also met a local who frequents Bandera multiple times per week so through him we were able to learn more about both the restaurant, it management and corporate history which is not really important for an update.  What is important is to remember to always ask if something you want is NOT on the menu.  Good example is their incredible meat loaf which I thought was long gone.  Not so according to our new friend who not only spotted it in the open kitchen but also asked our server who confirmed that it was.  I still haven't had their renowned rotisserie chicken which is a favorite of the friend who joined us for dinner.  This restaurant never ceases to amaze me and I don't think I would ever get tired of either the food, the ambience, energy and class of this place.  It may be part of a chain but it is one hell of a good chain restaurant.  Can't wait to eat there again!",

Oh, and we each had a glass of wine which was delicious. :-) One more thing...we noticed a couple walk in and the man had a sleeveless top on. He was politely told he needed something with sleeves.

The servers were attentive and one young man ( can't remember his name- wore glasses, dark brown wavy hair; sorry ) assisted my husband who has a physical disability by having us sit at a table closer to where we entered that had easier access.  We entered from the parking lot and walked through the kitchen prep area.  I was very grateful for this kind young man!  We love this place!",

The service and the consistency and delivery of the product is second to none. Even when they're slightly off, they are better than the rest. About the food: although the atmosphere is somewhat elegant, the food is purely comfort food. The beef ribs are absolutely delicious! The grilled artichokes, when in season, are amazing! The Caesar salad is the gold standard of all Caesar salads.  The biggest complaint I see on Yelp about them is the price. To that, I say, you get what you pay for!  Note to the manager: please bring back the regular mashed potatoes... cheese potatoes are too cheesy. Can't wait to go back again!",

She was extremely in tune with our needs. She would walk by often just to see if we needed anything else. She was warm and friendly. She wasn't the only one - we heard a few other employees talking to other tables and they were all very professional and caring.   To make this review really stand out. I left her a huge tip. Trust me I do not leave big tips; it is rare. She truly deserved it. When I say huge tip I don't mean 30%. I'm talking more than 50%. That's how good I felt after visiting banderas.   Food: we had the rotisserie chicken and the macho salad with the chicken. We had the artichoke for an appetizer. All of the food was great!  Beer: my husband loved the frozen cups that made the beer taste fantastic!  I had to speak to the manager just to let her know I was highly impressed with her team. She explained that their hiring process was pretty intense and they want their customers to feel special so they train their employees to exceed the standards.   If you've never been to this restaurant. You must go!!!",

Historically, the service is unparalleled. However, as of late, it seems things have gone downhill in that department. Sometimes we'll have amazing service, but other times we giggle at how terrible the service was. The food and drinks make up for EVERYTHING - hence the 5-star review.   The one thing that really does irk me and other guests and friends we've spoken to is the hostesses. My goodness! Those ladies sure know how to stare someone down and make them feel uncomfortable. I honestly can't recall a single time where I've felt welcomed. Hoping that changes over time with the seemingly revolving door of management.",

When we asked the waitress what was in the sauce she immediately told us and it had about 8 different ingredients, which explains why it had such a complex flavor. Oh, also get the kale salad. Just do it. It is phenomenal with crushed cashews creating a crunchy texture and delicious flavor!  I shared two entree items with a friend so we had the rotisserie chicken and prime rib cooked medium rare. The prime rib was bone-in and was huge!  The meat against the bone was delicious, but the rest of it was pretty standard for prime rib.",

Let's just say they're not known for making you feel all warm and fuzzy, but the food is always great so you go back.   If you want to go somewhere to spend time with friends or guests then don't come here.   Tonight my guest and I were asked to get up from our table to make room for the other reservations. I was so horrified that a manager would even come over to request such a thing. To clarify, we asked if this was a policy and she responded that yes- after 90 minutes they ask people to get up if they've finished their meal. If I'm going to spend about $80/person on dinner then I feel like I should be able to stay and enjoy my wine or cocktail.   Hillstone, Houston's, Bandera are industry stars when it comes to polished service but what the heck was that tonight?? I couldn't even believe it, I still don't think it has sunk in.

I was visiting from Texas and a group of us decided to try this place based on recommendations. The food was perfect. Cornbread is exceptional, prime rib was the best I've had, salmon was great, and broccoli was cooked perfectly. That's all of the food I tried but everyone in the group thought the food was amazing. The service was outstanding. Kind, attentive and knowledgeable servers. I even loved their \"uniforms\" and clean, slick back hair.",

Evidently some of the subtlest market positioning ever is taking place at their corporate headquarters.  Having said that, I like the place.  The cornbread is the stuff of legend, a modern day manna if you will.  Just read every other review.  Also, the way they roast their chicken is top notch.  I believe 3 of my favorite dishes there feature it.  Great American dining, even if it's hard to distinguish this place from a Houston's.",

He offered anything and everything to help us out and help take care of our children. Crackers, bread, he even brought over a plate of frys to help. And boy did it help.

My favorite entree is the Macho salad which is a really nice combination of the rotisserie chicken, toasted cornbread, fresh veggies, avocado, etc.   Last time we were there we also tried the ribs and they are excellent. The meat just fell of the bone and the sauce wasn't too heavy.   If you like rotisserie/BBQ, this place is for you!",

Lately however the menu has slowly been changing and not necessarily for the better.  First the classic rotisserie chicken we changed making like everyone else's chicken and potatoes.  The green rice was brought back but not the tortilla sauce ( although they still have it upon request.  Another classic they've abandoned was their take on the Pimm's cup.  The latest incarnation lowers the standard to be just like every other bar/restaurant in Scottsdale.  If you are coming back for the classics you probably won't find them here. 4 of our last 5 visits, the grilled artichoke hasn't been available and is MP3 longer a regular menu item.   Still the food is still good and the service outstanding. Although food often comes out of the kitchen not warm enough.",

The food is very good, with rotisserie chicken that you can see slowly turning on the rotisserie, smoked ribs, delicious salads and burgers to die for. You will not leave hungry, that is for sure.   You can eat at the bar or get a table, however there is usually a wait for tables, especially on the weekends.

It's a bit more cozier than Houston's with lots of u shape booths and same dimly lit environment.   The artichoke appetizer was not in season and got their cornbread skillet as an app instead. It was real satisfying. Wildfire offers it complimentary though. Don't know if there are Wildfire in AZ.   Their prime rib was so good and same with their filet. Rotisserie chicken was really good from what my friend said.   The service was very warm and friendly.  It's not too loud do you can carry on conversations with your friends.

Chef Jason has nailed this for foodlovers worldwide.  Again...OUTSTANDING!!  The prime rib...well...nothing less than awesome.  A very subtle back flavor of herbs.

But the food is sooo worth it. And it's in the middle of old town so it's walking distance to lots of shops so you can walk off your meal. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Okay Bandera. After a long hiatus we decided to try you again with some friends. At one time you were our favorite restaurant and we would come here as many as eight times a year. That quit happening after a series of rushed undercooked meals where the last time all in our party were ill. That is stomach wise.   Returning we found the same great atmosphere. The restaurant was comfortably cool and the corn bread was outstanding again unlike the last few trips where it was over cooked and dry. Had their rotisserie chicken which I always liked. Here is my problem. Now it comes with mash potatoes instead of their summer rice. That was disappointing. Service was rushed as usual. This was off season. We were with another couple. SLOW it down.  Anyway long story short. Probably won't be back for another few years.",

The place was packed for a Monday night and buzzing with loud noise. It was a bit hard to even have a dinner conversation but we got through it. I loved the atmosphere for the most part and the lighting.  We ordered the famous and well deserved reason to be famous artichokes- yum! Got a beer and a vodka ginger ale promptly and then ordered: I had the kale salad with peanut dressing and chicken and he had the enchilada plate - I loved my salad and he very much liked his no-meat enchilada that seemed to have sweet potato in it I believe? It was an interesting plate with a side salad he enjoyed and slices of pork. I didn't give it 5 stars because the pork was dry but I will say the side of horseradish we asked for to help pair with the dryness did help.  I would be back but not on a busy crazy night like this... would be much more enjoyable to be here on a slower night where you can visit and sip.",

The ambiance was very nice, and our server was polite, attentive, and very helpful.  The house salad I started with tasted noticeably fresh and was generous in size.  My wife had a rotisserie chicken, which she really enjoyed.  I had their special for the evening, a lamb sirloin, and I was delicious.  Very flavorful, and the sides (broccoli and mashed potatoes) were tasty as well - and I'm not usually a fan of broccoli.  The evening was topped off by a birthday dessert of a banana/chocolate pie - again, delicious.  No complaints about the food, service, or ambiance.  Wish we would have found this place earlier, and we'll definitely be back.  It's risen to the top tier on our list of Scottsdale restaurants.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Annual visit to Bandera's and was surprised to see a new menu  I had called in reservations advising that there would be 3 birthday boys, Hubby, SIL, and Son and a toddler. When we arrived, they made us wait until everyone was there which I don't understand why restaurants do that. Then we get to the table and there were only 4 place settings and no booster chair or high chair. Service was terrible. Waitstaff tried to clear table while we were still eating. Felt rushed but didn't see any customers waiting to be seated. Not only that, but there was no special offering of dessert for the birthday boys. We ordered the skillet cornbread, which was a little underbaked. Also ordered the green rice which was bland. SIL ordered the veggie platter and did not eat the tuna; it looked overcooked. Son had the ribs and chicken and the chicken was good. It should be since that is their signature dish. The ribs were beef and they were tender. They no longer have the pork spareribs, which is what Son wanted. Hubby ordered the prime rib and it was tough and overpriced. He substituted the mashed potatoes for the coleslaw which he's had in the past, but the kale in the coleslaw had not sat long enough in the dressing to have wilted and was still too crunchy for his palate. I didn't mind it, but since Hubby and Son have had this side dish in the past, they didn't feel it met up to their standards. All in all an average dinner and I had to take down the rating primarily because of the waitstaff and hostess and less than stellar food.",

The line to get in was out the door for 4 nights in a row. This may have been because of spring training or maybe its like this every night, who knows.   The food is good but maybe not worth the hefty price. The menu was somewhat limited but the server was really helpful and knew it inside/out. I had the steak/enchilada combo and it was good, but seemed to be cooked before hand then preheated when ordered. The cornbread is very good but a little does go a long way.  The french fries were unique and delish. The smash hit was the oreo ice cream dessert which was truly very memorable.",

The potatoes are good and they were GREAT 20 years ago-with the right combo of parsley, cabbage, and onion. Somehow the flavor has changed maybe due to recipe changes. It's been 3 years and I will be returning in another month to see what's changed and will update my review accordingly. Service has never been a problem however perhaps the economy has taken it's toll on the ingredients. Can't speak for the drinks - have not ordered any there.",

My every need was taken care of right away. I had a very attentive blonde female server! She was quick to take our drink order and made sure we had all the appetizers we could possibly need and suggested a really yummy one!(the deviled eggs, which to my surprise were absolutely delicious!) I also ate the chicken sandwich which is my norm and always so delightful! One thing that has always made me a little uneasy is the attire they dress their employees in. I am a personal shopper for Nordstrom and wish I could just get in their and dress these individuals. The white button up shirts and sherrif's badges scream olive garden/farm attire to me. If there is anything I could tell Bandera as to why they only got 4 stars is their clothing choices. Overall wonderful eats!",

The salmon  was raw in the middle (a little frustrating when you have to wait as long as you do at Bandera for a table or seat at the bar ect and not be able to eat your food when it comes).  I sent it back to be cooked but asked for chips and guac to snack on in the mean time.    I'm not all about getting a free meal because of inadequate cooking, but they could have at least comped the guac for me while I waited for them to cook my meal---again!   They didn't.  I was charged for it. I give Banderra a 4 or 5 for the food when it's cooked properly, but a 2 for the service.

    "text": "After reading some glowing reviews of Bandera (specifically of their 'best on the planet' cornbread) here on Yelp, Krashawnda just had to try the place. We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that.   The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping.   Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while.   To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience.   From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shot",

The food, I had the ribs and chicken combo... the ribs were WAY to dry and the sauce was, I don't even know what that was but it was not good.  The chicken was ok nothing to write home about but it was smokey which was nice.  Over just a very underwhelming experience.  If you want good smoke house or good prime rib experience go to Bootleggers across the street.",

The waitress misplaced my credit card and implied it was my fault. She said \"Im 99% sure I gave it back to you\".   After frantically looking all over our seats and floor for about 10 minutes,  the waitress came back with our credit card and made an excuse how she misplaced it.  I'm \"99% sure\" she wont be getting a tip....  It ruined the whole experience.   I recommend going to a restaurant where they take value in protecting your credit cards.",

It is a nice restaurant, with a dark wood decor.  Staff is friendly and they have a centralized bar.  I think it may be tough to have a large group meal here, unless you split up, because most of their tables are booths.  There is no patio seating, so you will be in dining in the dimly lit restaurant.    I had their Macho Salad: delicious and large!  The tomatoes and avocado slices were very large, and the chunks of goat cheese (which is soft and tasty) adds a nice flavor to the vegetable mix.",

We ate half as a starter along with the nice little house salad, and took the rest to go (ended up as a nice dessert later that night.   Also for dinner, we had the chicken, which was moist and tender, and the butternut squash enchilada, which came with a spicy glaze and was just unique and delicious! My companion says the enchilada was the highlight. Both were great and came with a tasty green chile rice.  Overall experience was great, too. We had early dinner reservations (5pm Saturday) prior to our evening plans and were seated promptly. Others without reservations seemed to be seated no problem either, though the place seemed to be getting pretty full. The wood fired menu options, tasty food, and great service made this one a winner!",

    "text": "I am only giving this one star as you have to give one to leave a review. This place, staff, management and corporate don't deserve any starts!  This was my first time eating here (March 10, 2014) I had some friends just get in from Cali that I had not seen in 25 years. We picked them up from their hotel around the corner at 5:45 and we were seated promptly for our 6:00 reservation. My girlfriend and I split a bottle of wine while my boyfriend and other friend had a martini.  When our dinner came we ordered a bottle of wine for the four of us. We had started with the artichoke appetizer which was probably the only good thing about our whole visit.  Our dinners came and we had not yet gotten our bottle of wine. My friend went to ask the waitress if we could get our bottle of wine as our dinner has been served. She said \"OK\".   We started eating our meals, I had the rotisserie chicken dinner with the green rice. My chicken was bland and red in the middle and my rice was cold. Before I could say anything, the waitress came to the table to see how it was, but we again asked for our bottle of wine. She than told she could not serve us anymore alcohol and that was their policy because my friend and I had shared a bottle of wine. More than two people have to share a bottle. They didn't tell us that when they served it to us. So my friend went to talk to the manager, Nick. He told her he was not serving us anymore because she was already slurring her words! This really upset my friend and she came back to the table in tears. My friend was in a horrific car accident a few years ago and her speech has been affected and Nick took that as her being drunk!!!  So my boyfriend goes to talk to the manager and he said the same thing. Then the waitress came back to the table and we told her this was ridiculous and she said that a week prior someone had gotten a DUI after leaving the restaurant and blamed the restaurant for over serving them alcohol so they were being cautious.  The manager came back to our table and told my friend she was DRUNK! Right to her face and that he will not serve us anymore.  My friend didn't even touch her dinner she was so upset. I didn't eat much of mine as it was cold and not good at all and then the managers behavior turned me off.  My friend asked that he take her dinner off the bill because he upset her and he at first said \"NO\" but after our arguing, he did take if off which we appreciated.  I called corporate and spoke to a nice woman there. She said they have to protect the restaurant and they don't know if we came from somewhere else that my friend could have gotten drunk at.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  This restaurant is part of a big corporation so what do they care?  I explained to her that we will never be back and we will tell all of our friends. The manager should be more sensitive to people than thinking everyone is drunk all the time. The only thing the woman was concerned about was Nick's usage of words \"slurring\" and \"drunk\" and she said she would speak to him about his verbiage.  My girlfriend is owed a big apology!!  We will never go to any of these restaurants and I we will spread this to all of our friends so they don't go either.  We went somewhere else where they were more than happy to serve us alcohol and they had NO ISSUE with my friend who has a handicap!!!",

Tonight the General Manager Sarah Ansley has turned us off to Bandera so that we will never be returning. We came to celebrate a birthday and were gladly willing to wait 45 minutes for a table. As we were taking pictures the host walked up to us and informed us that our 16 year old son was out of dress code in a jersey (mind you during March madness) and if we wanted to stay we would need to go get him a different shirt. We then asked how much longer our wait was going to be to which the general manager responded \"about 44 minutes.\" Even after over 15 minutes already waiting. My boyfriend then responded \"I'll go buy him a fucking poncho then.\" And walked out to buy him one. After mumbling under her breathe \"he won't be eating in MY RESTAURANT\" she then walked up to me, who had just received my drink at the bar and took it from me and told me because he cursed we couldn't eat there. Not only embarrassing but completely irrational. So bad that the nice older couple who witnessed it all decided they would voluntarily be leaving the place as well... NEVER again will we be back, horrible management and  a total birthday ruiner.",

I LOVE the seasonal veggie platter, which features a veritable bounty of the freshest veggies, cooked to perfection. Try the tuna poke, and pretty much every dessert on the menu if you're feeling decadent (but mostly the banana creme pie, a dish which I used to order and take home to eat in bed... don't judge me). So, my enthusiasm for Bandera is pretty solid. The reason why the fifth star eludes this restaurant is because they have the hardest time managing to seat people on time. I don't mind waiting (they have a bar, so no problems here), it's just something that's worth addressing.",

I wasn't particularly hungry when we stopped in for a late dinner before Nathan's surprise party, so my meal consisted of a few sides. We started with the obligatory cornbread skillet which everyone raves about...I wasn't crazy about it. I love the idea: cheese, cornbread and green chiles, but it was WAAAAY sweet for me. I definitely expected something more savory and cheesy, but the sweet corn over-powered everything else.   My 'meal' was the side house salad and a side of mac and cheese. I make really awesome m&c so I wasn't uber impressed with bandera's version but it was good nonetheless. The 'nice little house salad' was indulgent, my favorite part by far. Well-dressed, ribboned lettuces and cabbages, with I think 1/12th of an avocado and a tablespoon of goat cheese and a few other bits and pieces tossed in.   Our server was pleasant, service in general was quick and we were seated right away too, which was surprising on a Saturday night around 9pm. I would go back if someone suggested it.",

As for the service, I couldn't ask for better. Polite, fast, friendly, and professional. I saw that a previous reviewer had a lot to complain about a specific server and a lot to brag about their rich friend and how they spent a whopping $105.80... big whoop. Gotta love the snotty \"middle-class-millionaires\" around here. Anyways, it turns out the server they're complaining about is the same server we had, Kamaili. She was excellent, and I hope we have her every time we go here in the future. She was clearly focused on making sure we were happy with our meal.",

The croutons were made from the corn bread   The ribs and chicken were excellent. The BBQ sauce was not overpowering tart vinegar taste. The smokey taste hit the palate a few seconds after the sweet sauce taste.  My only disappointment was The banana cream pie.   The crust was a fine the filling was sad. It was like a very soft banana pudding poured into a pie. The bananas were in chunks on the side. The presentation was great but the taste very ordinary  The salad will Always bring me back",

    "text": "4 years ago I was praising Banderas for their exceptional service and food. Those days are over. Went back on the 20th of June for husband and mine 10th wedding anniversary because that's \"our\" place, met at Bandera's for first date, proposed and accepted 2 years after, went back every year for anniversary and decided to celebrate our 10th. We usually have Amy who is wonderful. She was not scheduled for the evening. The server we did receive was meh. I'm going to blame management for that, she was obviously not trained for exceptional service but you can't have your cake and eat it to, but we always did with Amy.  Banderas no longer carries Bone-in-Prime Rib. Knew that going in ,was hoping it was a special, was not. Ordered the Ribeye which was on menu and was told \"you're going to hate me but we are not serving that tonight\". If we were told from the very beginning of our dining experience this was the case, we could have had the option of leaving. But we had already ordered a Dip duo no guacamole and were in the process of ordering a bottle(which the order was not taken correctly).That is also due to a lack of training, always call back and get confirmation of order. Back to the Ribeye, was also told that the Ribeye was not being served because they were pushing the pork tenderloin.If that's the case ,reprint the menu and update the website menu so I do not drive 1.5 hours to be told that management changed their mind on menu selection.  So we both ordered the tenderloin, was perfectly cooked, absolutely delicious. Broccoli was perfect, corn perfect, mashed potatoes perfect. Thank you kitchen. Caesar salad tad too much dressing. Corn bread skillet was flipped upside down on plate, we like the crunch on top, don't know why server did that. Server broke cork had to get new bottle. Banana pie was meh. We left 20% off of $247 because we're not aholes but would have liked not to have been treated as if we were the problem. As a food industry professional I know exactly what goes into service. Banderas has always been a beacon of exceptional service and quality of food in Scottsdale. There are evenings when things don't go right and that's ok. I understand but there is obviously a change in management. Usually when you walk in the back door everybody greets you, not that evening.Usually management will touch tables, not that evening. Too many quality service issues for high ticket prices. Better to go to Steak 44 or Hillstone. Unfortunately we will not be coming back. Thank you Banderas for 12 good years.",

    "text": "Lovely ambiance, lackluster food.  Tried Bandera for the first time last after a friend convinced me to go somewhere new.  The ambiance was lovely and our waitstaff was friendly. We ordered the duo dip of guac and queso.  I'm not sure what others think of when they hear queso - but i think of melted cheese with a bit of spice to it.  This was a cold shredded cheddar cheese, and felt more like a 'pimento dip' than queso.  The quac was ok, just standard.  But they barely serve enough chips and we had to request more.  My friend ordered the seafood civeche, and was less than impressed as well, he barely ate 1/4 of it.  I then ordered the rotisserie chicken, which is described as coming with a 'mole' sauce.  Mole sauce is  typically 'black', due to their being a bit of chocolate in it with spices.  The chicken was served with a red sauce, that honestly tasted like campbells tomato soup to me.  I switched the fries for a side kale salad, and that was probably the only thing I enjoyed out of the meal.  The chicken itself was bland and looked as though it had absolutely no seasoning on it, just the skin.  After reviewing some of the photos on yelp this morning others have posted in the past, it's clear it's not the same recipe or dish I received last night.  My friend order the ribeye which came out precut up on his plate.  We were both surprised, as any half decent cook knows, you don't slice up steak all up right away, you let it sit so the juices can redistribute.  The juices from teh steak were all over his plate, rather than in the steak itself.  We were both left completely underwhelmed and have said we will not be back.  We should have just gone over to the mission instead like we originally intended.  Lesson learned.",

The reason for the bad review is simply bad service. The service was so pathetically slow, it ruined our dinner. It wasn't just one thing, it was as if every part of the dining experience took at least twice as long as it should have, up to the point where the server kept apologizing for her lack of attentiveness but did nothing to actually fix the problem. It was an annoying dinner, and it took her 15 minutes to bring the check after plates were halfway cleared, and there was never any mention of desserts.  Cost aside, Chipotle would've been a more satisfying experience...at least they have the sense to hire people who are right for the job.",

    "text": "Ah Bandera it's been years! Location couldn't be better right off Scottsdale road, the decor is warm and chic but reminds me of an upscale Houston's to be honest. The service was more than adequate on a busy night not overly attentive but we never wanted for anything (for too long) Iron skillet cornbread was as advertised \"sweet and spicy\" I am not a cornbread fan although the table devoured it! I liked the spicy aspect of it I think they might use jalapenos, for not being a cornbread fan thumbs up for sure. I had the rotisserie chicken with mole amarillo. I'm always apprehensive about big pieces of chicken some rely on the sauce because they are dry as the Sahara! NOT here it was moist and delicious and the partial skin that remained had a nice crispiness to it. Wild mushroom meatloaf, wow I guess I haven't tasted meatloaf since I was a child at my Great Aunt's house, I didn't know it could be succulent and slightly pink in the middle and not brown like a hockey puck! Who knew? Delicious. Only complaint was the \"seasonal vegetable\" broccoli I love broccoli; However usually when you get broccoli at a restaurant the pieces are separated so you can pick one up at a time with your fork right? This was a head of broccoli connected at the bottom in one blob which required cutting leaving the base that no one eats on the plate. Not a fan of that, otherwise thumbs up!",

To go to the Old Town area on a Friday night and hope to get a table is not how I want to start my weekend.  They told me they're trying something new.  WHY?  Aggravate the \"locals\" why don't you.  Aren't we the ones who keep you in business during the \"off season\"?",

    "text": "The aroma of barbecue coming from this place drew us in.  The service however was less than desirable. We started at the front area bar due to a wait for a table.  To be fair the bar and restaurant were busy but the bar tender had enough time to leave the bar a couple of times when we were waiting for drinks. We were sitting in 2 seats so it was hard to overlook the fact that new costumers were seated. We waited for 20-25 minutes without service and were eventually seated for dinner in the restaurant.  The food was very good. We started with corn bread which I highly recommend. My husband got the enchiladas which he really liked and I got a salad with chicken which was good. We got a beer and a margarita. Our server was attentive and had a great personality. However, there was a woman walking around clearing tables that made us feel very rushed through dinner. As soon as we put a fork down our plate was cleared which I usually appreciate. It became a bit aggressive at one point because this happened multiple times immediately upon finishing.  I have been a server in the past so I understand the benefit of quick turnover but my husband and I do not tend to linger in restaurants for long periods of time and the tables around us had all been there longer than we had. When I turned my head my margarita was cleared (which was not cheap) before I was finished. Although the food was very good the service was lacking and I will not plan on returning.",

We had ate here 10-15 years ago when it opened, and I thought it would be fun to go back and try it again.  I was really glad we made this decision.  We started with the cornbread and a rack of ribs to share between ourselves.  Now, I had been to other Hillstone restaurants and I new the cornbread would be great.  However, I had never had the ribs.  They had a good char on them and were fall off the bone tender.  They topped the ribs with a mustard BBQ sauce that was just perfect balance of sweet and savory.  I had the 'campfire' blackened ribeye.  Perfect temperature.  An interesting blackening rub gave it a sweet smokey flavor.  It needed salt and a little more 'heat' for my taste for a blackening seasoning.  My other buddies also got the rib eye or the bone in prime rib.  The prime rib looked awesome...I was a little jealous.  Two last comments:  The wine prices are more than fair...they appeared to not mark up their wine at all.  We had a bottle of the Lewis Cellars Hillstone Cab...$125.  This is what I would pay retail for it.  This was a very nice surprise.  Lastly, our server, Anna, was outstanding...dealing with our alcohol induced antics and giving us great recommendations throughout the meal.  1st class server in a great dining establishment.  The GM should be proud of what they are doing.",

    "text": "Somebody please lower the flag to half-mast out of respect for Bandera's dead menu. I was wondering why they kept it dark in the restaurant. It was so dark, I could see the ghosts of past meals wandering around. 'Eeeeat meee.'  I dined there expecting dinner, but felt like I got only small plates. I'll admit less is more sometimes, and with my finickiness and snobbishness for quality over quantity, I'd like to think this was a good deal. Have I been took, because I'm feeling jooked - hook, line, and sinker?  Seasonal Vegetable Platter ($15) was pretty with bright primary and secondary colors of reds, yellow, greens, purple. It served a bit of cucumber salad (very tasty), cherry tomato halves, a slice of red bell pepper and a yellow slice too, broccoli, and disappointing bread that was soggy with something oily.   Skillet Cornbread ($8) is about 6\" diameter. It's good but crumbly and too sweet. I wanted a strong corn flavor with spiciness from the jalapenos, but I tasted no corn and no pepper whatsoever.   Dip Duo ($8) with thick tortilla chips was delicious and I could not stop eating the chips. My impulse was to order more, but the ramification of eating too much of a good thing...ugh, I decided to pass this time around. First dip was avocado. Very good (no tomatoes - yeh!) and not salty. The second dip was of cheese and very salty - chunky too - like cottage cheese which was kinda weird. If you order it, do yourself a flavor and slap some of that salty stuff on the sweet cornbread. Winner!   Salad ($10) was good with fresh greens.  Enchilada ($7) of potato, squash, and shard was topped half-and-half in two sauces tasted okay.  Other items on the menu include entrees and specialties ranging from $15 to $40 and desserts for $8.",

I started with their house margarita which was made especially well. We tried the special for our appetizer which was roasted Brussels sprouts with a dipping sauce and it was amazing and very healthy. For my entree I had the enchilada. The enchilada was different with the squash inside but the sauces they topped it with added a lot of flavor. It came with their cucumber salad and cilantro lime rice both were great compliments of the main dish. Will defiantly be back for special occasions since it is a little pricey!",

I had the prime sirloin tri tip with white cheddar enchilada and I am admittedly a sucker for enchiladas anytime anywhere, and Bandera's version was a winner. The steak was also cooked very well and the service was super-duper quick and friendly. The ambiance is noisy, but I liked it and I liked that the kitchen was open too.

    "text": "So my friend from Tucson said when she's in PHX she always likes to stop by at this restaurant called Bandera. She told me how good it was so I went on Yelp to do some research because I haven't heard of this place, which to me was shocking. I'm not sure how I missed this place because it's right in Old town where all the restaurants are at. O_o  So what grabbed my attention from the pictures on yelp was their Cornbread... let me just say that I LOVE good cornbread...Bandera serves their cornbread on a skillet, it came out right out of the oven, hot, fresh, crisp, and my golly it so good! (Yes, I said \"Golly\" lol...)  I could  taste the corn and jalapenos all together in my first bite. If anyone has tried ZTeja's skillet style cornbread, Bandera has got it in the bag! I just wanted to eat that as my main entree...it was that good...!)  I got the Prime Sirloin Tri-Tip and Enchilada Platter with cucumber salad (this seemed the be the popular choice on yelp). The portion was good, although it was plenty it wasn't too small or gigantic. Everything went well together, the sirloin was cooked to medium rare, the enchilada was delicious with the perfect amount of their special enchilada sauce that was drizzled on top, and their cucumber salad was refreshing! My bf got the Aged Prime Rib which is slow roasted on the bone with mashed potatoes. He was surprised on how big the rib was, it was literally the size of his hand haha! It was just way too much meat for him, if you like a lot of meat then this dish is for you!   So everyone said that they were full and had no room for dessert but I insisted on getting something! It was either between Banana Cream Pie or their homemade Oreo Cookie, they both looked so good but we choose the Banana Cream Pie with caramel and crushed chocolates to share and guess what...we all killed it!   I would definitely recommend this place. The ambiance was great, service was fantastic, food was good, check it out. =) I'll be back to try their Oreo Cookie Sandwich next time and of course their Cornbread.",

Unfortunately I can't remember my waitress's name, but she was one of the best waitress we've had in a while. Food was brought out immediately and was incredibly tasty, corn bread is great! Our fave dish was the BBQ Salmon. Great place for a special occasion!",

They also have TVs and good beer on tap so it sort of a sports bar with amazing food but not noisy; just cozy.  I put prices at $$$ but they have other items on the menu.  The fried corn bread is really nice.  I thought it would be boring but enjoyed it.",

The bar menu was interesting and the wine list was well chosen.  My companion's dessert, a homemade Oreo sandwich, looked amazing.  The Not So Good:  I have food intolerances, but I'd rather just order carefully than discuss them with strangers.  That means I rely on accurate menus, not ordering the entree that comes with ponzu, even though I love Ahi, and asking for no almonds on my Macho Salad.  It's really good and half as big as one I'd make for myself, which makes it a very large salad, but it was a chore removing the many croutons and getting all the corn out would have required more patience than I have.  I'd probably eat here again quite happily, if it didn't require that conversation (\"So, I can't eat..., etc.), but it does, so I'd rather move on to one of the many other fine restaurant choices in Phoenix and Scottsdale.",

    "text": "The food at Bandera was very good.  I was with a group, and we shared a couple starters that were all delicious:  the corn bread was flavorful and beautifully presented, and the \"duo-dip\" (guacamole, and a cheese-type dip) were seasoned perfectly.  For the main course, I had roast chicken and it, too, was delicious.  So, why only 3-stars???  My issue goes beyond the food and drinks, I had a very strange experience at Bandera - one that I've never had at any other restaurant.  I was with there for a business dinner, and we weren't sure if 6, 7, or 8 people would be joining us.  First, our group encountered a lot of resistance to us sitting at ANY table if we weren't exactly sure how any people would be there, despite the fact that when we arrived, the restaurant was nearly empty.  (Being fare to Bandera, they did draw a very nice crowd, just a little bit later).  We ultimately sat at a table for 7, and of course, our 8th person arrived.  Even though we made room by squeezing in - and we were ok with that - the wait staff hurried over to let us know we had to split up into two tables.  We reiterated that we were fine, but it was made clear that 8 people at this table for 7 was NOT ok..... Our business dinner ended up split between two tables.  Very odd.      Sadly for Bandera, the people at this dinner were influential local and national business leaders who dine out frequently.  After dinner, many of us commented that this restaurant did not seem to be amenable to accommodating our group, and most of us won't be returning for future business dinners.  Here's the thing:  if you go to Bandera, expect good food, but only go with a smaller group.  (And, by the way, the largest table they have seats 7, so let that be your guide).",

This was by far the best kids meal I have ever had, and we eat out with our kids a LOT! I think it was about $5 and they shared it. It was a leg and a thigh (I assume it is the same as their regular roasted chicken). Super moist and flavorful. Served with a side of your choice. We chose mashed potatoes. They were fantastic too. I also ordered a side of broccoli for them and it was a nice sized portion for $4. The broccoli was super good, but tasted like it had a good amount of butter on it.

What struck us this time is the service.  The servers themselves were ok, I just think the management needs to receive and provide some training - and look at some of their silly policies.  We went on July 5th - a very slow day when we got there. We were meeting a friend who was visiting from out of town for dinner.  At least half the tables were empty, yet when we asked to be seated they said \"You can wait at the bar. We don't seat you until everyone is here.\"  We told them, half the tables are empty.  Can't we be seated?  \"It is our policy,\" they said.  After a bit of pleading with a \"you've got to be kidding me\", they agreed to seat us.  I can understand the policy if the restaurant was busy, but it was almost empty!  Then, the servers kept trying to rush us.  When our friend got there, the server kept trying to take our order.  We ordered some cornbread and said we wanted a little time to visit.  We got the cornbread, but kept getting rushed to order.  Once the food came, the servers (not just ours, but others) kept hovering by like they were checking us out. It was an unpleasant dinner.  Then, they kept trying to rush us out.  I am sensitive to staying in a restaurant and \"hogging\" a table, but that wasn't the case.  I could see the front door and kept an eye on it to make certain there were no people waiting.    If you want to get a quick dinner, then this place is fine.  If you want to enjoy a reasonable dinner, I'd find someplace else.",

Boyfriend had the ribs, which fell off the bone into succulent pieces of perfection. He even enjoyed the cole slaw which is a dish he usually detests! Topped it all off with banana cream pie. This pie has the perfect amount of chocolate shavings and caramel sauce all atop a walnut-Graham cracker crust. Swoon. Highly recommend and we will certainly be back!",

I asked the server what their secret is.  She said good food, good prices and good service.  She described it perfectly.  While I am not usually into chain restaurants, I was pleased with the food, prices and service.  The BBQ salmon was good. The cornbread is a must try, as is the mashed potatoes.  It is also fun to sit at the bar.",

It is SO GOOD, a crunchy sweet crust on top, a savory, almost muffin like inside that is filled with cheddar cheese, jalapenos, and maybe even some onions and chives.  Wow, TASTY!  and totally worth the $5 for an app. to share.  Now, I have read other reviewers say that the rotisserie chicken is the king.  So I had it, and I have to quote Jim Carrey in Liar Liar - \"I've had better.\"  It was good chicken, I have certainly had better other places.  The spanish rice, however was the best I have had. now that is good stuff.  Too much cilantro on their escabeche made it awkward to eat.    It was a great place to eat, perfect lighting, AMAZING waiter service, and tasty local Amber brew.    Great place for a night out in Old Town....",

There were three large booths open and set for dinner. The hostess told us we would have to wait 45 min for a table until people were done eating. We asked about the three large booths and they said they could not seat our party unless we took two separate tables and split the group.   We asked why we couldn't be seated at the large booth and they said it was against policy to seat six people in a booth for five. It was obvious the large booth would accommodate 6 to 8 with ease, yet they continued to tell us that we would have to wait for the other smaller booth. Go figure... We know the cherry creek grill in Denver very well (I hear it's owned by the same person) and decided they clearly don't need our business at either location in future.  We found a nicer more accommodating place across the street.",

Immediately we noticed that we were perhaps a bit underdressed, but the wait staff was amazing at making us feel welcomed. We had our three small children with us, which is also not a great idea here, but our server went above an beyond to make them comfortable as well. You have to get the cornbread appetizer! It is the best cornbread I have ever had! I also had the tuna for my meal and it was delicious! Very intimate atmosphere; great for a date night or get together with friends.

The menu varies with seasonal vegetables, entrees & drinks come go like the seasons. The things I go to Bandera for don't change. The skillet green chili cornbread always hot, moist, sweet & salty just great. The macho salad is delicious from start to finish. All of the senses are tantalized completely. The burning flesh aka the rotisserie chicken calls my name when I turn the corner onto Scottsdale Rd. in Old Town it's always delish. The grilled artichokes & ice cold Stella don't hurt either. I recommend them one & all. Bring Friends or a hungry date & prepare to pull an Al Bundy & unbutton those True religions or better yet leave those at home girlie's because this isn't for the faint of heart. I do have one very very small issue I have begged and pleaded my pathetic desires for the basil martini to return & alas they have all been brutally rebuffed. Each of my food fairies aka wait staff have given me different versions of why it left the menu when on my last visit I was told it was a pain to make so they removed it. Finally, that's what was probably the most pathetic but refreshingly honest answer I'd been given to date. It was one the the few drinks on the menu that required multiple steps behind the bar beyond a pour of this & that. I loved it though & can now accept it's premature departure & lay my case to rest it was a pain to make. But like a high maintenance woman I wouldn't wanna put up with making it myself I did enjoy it while I could. Good bye Basil Martini & hel-lo Ginger Basil Martini. Not the same but a decent backup plan.",

Bandera altho a chain and part of the Houston's brand is one of those chains that I will frequent because they are worth it.  For some odd reason I like my 3s and if I were to recommend 3 items on their menu ok wait 4... but the main 3 are the Green Chile Cornbread Skillet, the Bandera Cheeseburger and the Roast Chicken. These menu items are foods that must be tried because they're good. The cornbread skillet is crumbly, moist, and simply good. It easily serves at least 3 people but the center comes out drier so ask for some extra butter in order to moisten it a little bit. The Roast Chicken is half a chicken and served with green rice (the fourth recommended item) which is divine. The Roasted Chicken is moist, and the flavors of the chicken is scrumptious. And last, the Bandera Cheeseburger which must be cooked medium but it's not served on the usual two buns, not it's like a long bun split in 3, so it comes out like large sized sliders. Along with the shoestring fries and that my foodsters is one of the best cheeseburgers on the old town drag. LOVE it! Bandera's is perfect for date nights, friend night outs, and family dinners. It's a nice laid out place with good service and totally recommend dining there. deuces!",

    "text": "So it's been almost 3 years since a friend of mine told me this place was not so great so I never went. Finally after all this time we decided to give it a shot. What a shame we waited so long! The restaurant is truly a great spot. It's a limited menu so don't expect to have a million things to choose from, but it's got the basics and good ones at that.  I tried their chicken and rib dish and was very happy with the result. Juicy, flavorful, and gone in about 15 min. The meat slipped right off the bone and had the perfect touch of sweetness. My gf had the chicken sandwhich (we've ordered it to go 2 times since) and it's def a winner. Big and enough for two to share if you're concerned about your beach body. Sides are okay, thought the fries were more like shoestring and even still, really too thin and crispy to call it a fry. Mashed potatoes are decent not a big fan of the amount of scallions mixed in...call me crazy but I'm not feelin' a crunch when I eat mashed potatoes! Mac and cheese was pretty good, thought it was cooked really well not extremely cheesy (although I do like that too) but enough to make you feel good and prob my favorite of all three.  My only problem was this: we ordered the cornbread bc it's obviously their highlight app (and it was reaaaaallllyyy good) but we didn't get it until after they served our main course. Kinda annoying but not the end of the world.  Insdide is very reminiscent of a Houston's style retaurant in terms of lighting and booths and colors. Nothing super cool but still very nice. Always draws a crowd but a drink at the bar never hurt anyone. House margarita was real tasty, but hit me with a little more tequila next time so I can feel it!",

The food was great, although a little spicy. I like hot food, but you need something to temper the heat a little during the meal. The pork carnitas were great, my wife had the butternut squash and white cheddar enchiladas. Fantastic! The deviled egg appetizer was also a pleasant surprise.

I love, love, love their grilled artichoke appetizer! I think it is one of the best in town and is served with their delicious creamy dipping sauce.  Their rotisserie chicken is delicious and my favorite entree on their menu is their grilled bbq salmon which is cooked perfectly tender and melts in your mouth!

Their rotisserie chicken is good too--you can see the chicken roasting on the spit through one of the side windows of the restaurant. The only downfall? The water glasses are really really tiny. It isn't a huge deal, but as a big water drinker, I feel bad having my server come to refill my glass 19 times throughout my meal. Good thing the service is so nice!",

    "text": "Absolutely horrific experience. Would not recommend this place to anyone. I had a large group and attempted to call ahead for reservations. I was told I would need to come in. I then walked to the restaurant and put my name in. I was told my party would be seated in two groups of 6 in approximately an hour. They do not offer a call or beeper service so I was told to call back in a half hour check the wait time. I did as instructed and was told the wait would be 30 minutes. I had my entire group of 12 leave the bar we were at enjoying drinks immediately to ensure we were on time. When we arrived at the time we were told to arrive, I was told they could only sit us in 3 groups of 4. This was not what I was told initially and unfortunately, this did not fit our group dynamic. Rather than apologizing for the mistake, the hostess accused me of lying with her finger pointed in my face. The manager offered no solution. We waited over an hour and a half and were not ever seated. Luckily, Gramaldi's down the street is delicious and accommodating.",

The Mustard Barbecue Beef Ribs were so burnt that when we called back the waiter, he recognized this before we even said anything and took it back.  We were brought the check without requesting it and without being offered dessert. As soon as we finished dessert, our water glasses and napkins were removed.  When I asked--tongue in cheek--if it was because he wanted us to leave, he said \"yes\" just loud enough for us to hear.  Feeling lead out the door, my wife and I were quite embarrassed and will not be returning.",

    "text": "Tonight I had an excellent meal at Bandera.The jalapeo queso dip appetizer was quite tasty.  My rotisserie chicken sandwich was the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten. The chicken was tender, the cheese was melted yet still flavorful and the bun complemented the flavors as opposed to just being filler.  It was my first time visiting the restaurant and I was unaware that it was part of a chain. I think that speaks volumes about the establishment right there. I'm rating Bandera four stars instead of five because the prices were rather high for the size of the portions. That being said, the portions were what I would call \"a good size\" compared to say, Claim Jumper which has portions that are too large. Further, I think that Bandera could use a larger selection of beers and mixed drinks.   Bandera was packed, something that surprised me for a Thursday night, and while I was able to get a table for two almost immediately, the background din made it difficult to hold a conversation or even clearly hear the server. I enjoyed the darker candle and track-lighting lit atmosphere, but it might be a turn off for some.  I'm definitely going back to Bandera, but next time I'll be prepared and not wear a ball cap, as they aren't allowed in the dining room. ;-)",

The Bandera Baby Back Short rack of ribs is the best I've had from anywhere in AZ. On this evening, my guest Sheldon had sliced sirloin and enchiladas which were excellent, both in presentation and flavor.  There are lots of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, and many of them are very, very good... But, I keep going back to Bandera because of their incredibly consistent high quality service and a menu that may be less variety than most people are used to seeing, but which every single entree is excellent.  Plus, I seem to run into a lot of the PHX Valley's movers and shakers in this establishment while dining there or hanging out at the excellent bar that seems to be quite the hot spot.",

It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top! Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)...  I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!",

I began my ventures here on the recommendation of a coworker after I mentioned eating complimentary cornbread from Z'Tejas and the $2 basket at Redfish Grill and Bar.  I first started having one huge slice (you can substitute a slice for a side that comes with their entrees).  I then graduated to just ordering the skillet and having two slices.  On my next visit I had half of the pan (the server even commented how the meal I was having that night wasn't very nutritious).  I seriously believe that my corn allergy was aggravated with my obsession of Bandera's cornbread skillet :(  I was able to try two entrees on separate occasions before I went stir-crazy on the cornbread.  Bandera is known for their rotisserie chicken, so do try some.  The salmon is also very good.  For sides, the spinach and glazed carrots are nice.  The enchilada my aunt tried was also quite tasty!  To help keep your wallet padded, have lunches here instead of dinner.  The vibe here is usually subdued, with great-looking staff and clientele occupying space, but it can get quite noisy on busy nights.  In the summer, try to sit at a booth with the window cracked open.  So refreshing, and quite relaxing- almost like having dinner at one of your chalets.",

And if you have a party of 7, they only have two booths to accommodate you, but they don't tell you that when you call to make reservations.  So, we had to wait an hour. Even though a booth that would fit 6 (and could easily fit 7) was open - they wouldn't allow us to sit there.  And don't even try coming with 8 people, they won't allow that many at a table.  So, besides that and the slow service at the bar, we still managed to have a good time.  My Carnitas Sandwich with Braised Pork, Avocado & Rio Grande Glaze was delish - although I would prefer it without the avocado.  I also got the mac and cheese - which was just okay - I wouldn't recommend it.  I stole some of the shoestring fries from a friend - they were quiet tasty!  Also, my glass of wine Mi Sueno El Llano (a cab) was perfect.    All in all, I would come back here with a girlfriend or a date.  Definitely not a good place to dine with a group!",

We ordered the corn bread, which was HUGE (enough to share with four people) and came with some onions and jalapenos.  Warm and good (if you like what's inside).  Then we split their rotisserie chicken and their pork ribs.  I'm not a huge fan of pork, or of ribs, but these pork ribs were absolutely delicious.  They slid off the bone with no problem, and they were just the right amount of sweet and with very little fat.  The chicken was also pretty good, but I found it a bit dry.  It would have deserved 5 stars if the chicken was a bit more juicy and if they had a larger menu.  As it was, the menu was a bit limited.",

I was there on Sunday for a birthday dinner with some friends and I left asking my wife: \"Why don't we come here more?\"  Bandera is part of Hillstone, so it is like Houstons in a way. I prefer Bandera due to the smaller, seasonal menu and the smaller, more intimate feel to the restaurant. On Sunday, I had the ribs, my wife had the lamb (a special item that night), and both were delicious. The table got the cornbread to start (amazing), and we finished with their banana cream pie (UH-Mazing). The rest of the sides, salads and entrees that we ordered were very good as well.   Every time I've been there the service has been spot on, the cocktails are good and the food is consistently great. I'll probably end up here again within a week or two.   Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Wow. I don't know what the heck happened to Bandera. This has been our absolute favorite restaurant for many years and we've always raved about the prime rib to everyone. We took some friends out for dinner for a special occasion and arrived there early since it's usually busy on Saturday nights. We were surprised to find that it was not busy at all and we were seated right away. We ordered at 6pm and 30 minutes later the server came back to apologize that they only had one prime rib left (all 4 of us ordered the prime rib). That has never happened to us before and we usually go for much later dinners. So disappointing. But we ordered rib-eyes instead. 15 minutes later they came back to say they were out of rib-eyes as well. When we finally got meals well over an hour after we ordered, my prime rib was WAY over cooked. I ordered it medium and it was definitely well done but since it was the last one there was nothing that could be done. They offered to bring me another dish but I didn't want to wait any longer. The prime rib was also tiny compared to what they used to serve. I would write this one night off as a fluke but they replaced their AMAZING mashed potatoes with a pathetic little smear of what seemed like mashed potatoes out of a box. I gave this review 2 stars because the server and manager were very gracious and comped most of our bill. I don't know what changed but I will really miss the flawless food and service of the old Bandera. I guess all things must come to an end. Sad.",

So if someone is late and another group come in before your last person shows up, you'll lose your table. Corporations suck! Eat at locally owned establishments.  The food is average. I've had better.",

    "text": "What a great intimate place for a date night or dinner with a few friends. Bandera is a small cozy establishment with a bustling crowd. I'm not sure, but I didn't see any big tables to accommodate more a bigger group (8+). All the booths on the side seem like they were meant to hold 6 people max. Anyways, the place we actually ended up sitting in the bar area b/c a spot opened up fairly quick after we got a few cocktails. (20mins at opposed to waiting for 40 mins for a table).   The drinks we got were strong and pretty good. I wouldn't say it's a place to go for cocktails since I've had better ones at speakeasy type bars. However, they do have a pretty good and unique in house selection of cocktails like the alcoholic tea.   The food was amazing. This was the best part of coming to Bandera. We started off with the skillet cornbread which was sweet, savory, and had the right texture. Will definitely recommend it to anyone coming here. Then we shared the enchiladas and the macho salad with rotisserie chicken. Both are very very good as well. Portions are huge too, so sharing is encouraged.   The service i thought was top notch. Everyone was very friendly and the food came out super fast! I was almost surprised by how fast the food was coming out and they were all at the right temperature and no undercooked dishes.   Overall, i would love to go back and try out different items.   Tip would be to make a reservation if possible since there is a huge crowd waiting outside and most times the wait could be 40+ if not longer. Or you can just wait around the bar and wait for a spot to open up!",

But regardless, this place is a \"must go to\".   Great atmosphere, we stayed there for over an hour and a half talking with just simple small dishes. Very relaxed, yet personal vibes going on and our waiter was HILARIOUS. great service, great recommendations and even tastier food!   If you're in downtown Scottsdale and looking for a place to dine.. I would definitely check this place out!",

    "text": "My friend and I went there on Monday night, had an amazing meal.  It was one of the best filet mignon either of us have ever tasted.  The artichoke appetizer was fantastic, best choke I've ever had.  Waitress was very good as well.    It was so good that the very next night (last night - Tuesday) we decided to go back.    We arrived at 915-930pm.  We were promptly seated. And we knew very quickly what we wanted to eat.  Prime rib and ahi, Caesar salads, and an artichoke app.  Ordered it.  Got a couple beers.   Then very quickly we got our artichoke.  Next we got our salads about two minutes later, and about two minutes after that we got our entrees.  We'd literally taken maybe two bites of salad and the waitress brings the entrees.    Talk about rushed!  It only gets worse.  About four minutes later the waitress comes by and takes my friend's beer glass.  He said \" can I have another one?\"  She said, \"we're not serving anymore alcohol.\"  And I forgot to mention that the waitress had a generally bad attitude and snooty demeanor.  She was very obviously annoyed by a late table.  Very obviously annoyed.  No apology about the rush or no more beer just a snotty attitude.  She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.  She was just thrilled to see us leave.    Call me crazy but in my 25 years working and managing a multitude of restaurants in every food genre and class NEVER, unless it was 2am and illegal did anyone not get offered another drink.  NEVER did I treat a customer so poorly, and NEVER did I allow my staff to do so either.    Maybe we need to put training wheels on the conversation for their staff.  Anyone heard of profit and loss?  EPIC FAILURE!    You lost customers.  You lost profit.  I vote with my wallet.  And my friend that took me out both nights makes more sitting on his couch than the staff put together.  It would be laughable to be treated like crap by crappy staff if it wasn't such a phenomenal example of how NOT to do customer service.    You lost big money; big Scottsdale money.    Call me crazy",

Our dirty dishes was taken away really quickly and they checked up on us very often.   We also had a smoked salmon appetizer and that was very good to. They had this tarter sauce that went very well with the salmon. I could eat that sauce by itself lol.",

    "text": "So we eat at Hillstone or Houstons about 6 to 8 times a month. Tonight was our first time at Bandera.  Made a reservation for 7:00 and we were seated around 7:10 which was excellent!!!  Once seated our impatient waitress was nothing but RUDE at best the entire meal. After asking us if we were ready to order 3 times within 10 minutes....we felt forced to choose our meal and actually would have had an appetizer but weren't given the time to make a decision.  We both had salads with the meal but before we could get finished our meals were already at the table. That is not what we have come to expect with a Hillstone Restaurant.  Our dinners were good Prime Rib and BBQ salmon. No real complaints about food quality with the exception that I had to ask 3 times for my Ice Tea to be refilled...absolutely not acceptable. Again our server was not up to the quality I would expect from a Hillstone restaurant.  Normally I have no problem remembering our waitress name..and providing a substantial TIP but this waitress didn't impress enough to matter.  UPDATE: Received a follow up phone call from General Manager Sarah and was very impressed with her concern about our service last night. I felt reassured that she would address our concerns...thanks to Sarahs follow up we will be visiting Bandera again soon.",

The food at Bandera is always consistent - so much so that when we don't know where to dine at we end up here because we know it will always be a fantastic meal.    We started off diner with a couple of Martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives - some of the best colossal olives out their!  Here's a nod to the top notch waitress, Ashley Z., halfway thru our martini's she noticed that the glasses weren't as chilled so she replaced our glasses.  We ordered the devil-eggs and fire roasted artichoke to start.  Definitely get the artichoke when it is in-season.  My Fiance ordered the rotisserie chicken which is a huge portion of their famous chicken - very moist and tender served with mash potatoes.  I had the BBQ salmon which is my go to, it is cooked to perfection and never dry.",

Best to be shared amongst 3 other people but I tell you it is a MUST try.   Chicken/Ribs combo - Chicken was moist and very well spiced. Ribs tasted deep fried! Delicious. The bbq sauce on the ribs was sweeter than I am use to but left a fairly refreshing taste in my mouth.   Service:  This is Scottsdale...service better be good! And it was.   Environment:  Dampened environment. Great for first dates or lonely dinners on your own. I highly suggest sitting at the bar if you are eating alone.

    "text": "I have been going to Bandera for years. They had delicious chicken, great service and fair prices. Went for dinner yesterday and couldn't have been more disappointed. I ordered club soda with lime. The server brought me a bottle of Perrier and did not ask me if that was what I wanted.  They have a delicious seasonal artichoke on the menu. I asked the server the price, she told me $9-$10 dollars, which is high, but so worth it. I ordered that along with dark meat rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes. The artichoke was delicious and asked for a box and some sauce as it was too big to finish. She boxed the artichoke but never gave me the sauce. I cut into the chicken and it was bloody. Sara, the manager came to the table offering to make me something else, but after looking a the blood, my appetite was gone.  My bill arrived - $16 for the artichoke (seriously) and $3 for the Perrier.   I had been visiting my mother in the hospital all day and was just too tired to call the manager again. So left my money and started driving home. I was really aggravated with the entire thing so I called Sara, the manager and told her about the server forgetting the sauce, giving me the wrong price, reiterating that the chicken was bloody and how disappointed I was since living here for 27 years and coming to their restaurant many times.   Did I want my money back? No, but would have appreciated more than an apology. A gift card, a \"please come back again and let me take care of you\"...something to make me want to eat at Bandera again. It's very sad when people just don't care enough to keep their regular customers. Soon the snowbirds will fly back to their roost and Bandera may be looking for regulars like me. Shame on them!",

It was 8:55 pm and they close at 9:00pm but the place was still busy and they didn't hesitate to serve us.  I call that great service.  We weren't terribly hungry so ordered the BBQ artichokes with the perfect seasoning and wonderfully crispy edges and just the right amount of grill marks.  The mayo or aioli served with them was perfect.  A total of 1 1/2 artichokes or three halves.  They tasted like they steamed or boiled them in a garlic lemon water.  Them cut in half, cleaned out so the stems were very tasty after grilled with a real smoke flavor.   We highly recommend them.  We then shared the combo plate of chicken and beef ribs.   Ahhhhh.  Those beef ribs were so great tender falling of the bone with a wonderful brown glaze sauce.  Their cole slaw had a hint of broccoli and the dressing was outstanding.  It also came with a western flare on a caprese salad.  Two golf ball size vine ripe tomato's with a. Ice basal balsamic topping and clumped mozzarella.   A delight to eat.  The chicken had a nice BBQ'd skin that was Smokey and tasty.  We had a breast with winglet and a drum stick.  The winglet and drumstick were great and tasty.  It was late and I ll give them the benefit of the doubt but the breast was a little over done and well dry.   But part of that is us we prefer the dark meat.   Will definitely return. The Arnold Palmer has a wonderful fresh squeezed lemon aid.   Definitely a truly western dinner.",

The margaritas and the jalepeno cornbread.  I think the margaritas were the best, but I dont know what they have done last few times they have not been the stellar margarita we are use too.

It was moist in the inside the nice and crunchy on the edges. I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken & Carolina-Style Barbecue Beef Rib Combo with Cole Slaw. The chicken was moist and tender and the meat slid off the bone and tasty. My wife had the Butternut Squash enchiladas which she has ordered each time we come here. For dessert, we shared their House-Made Oreo Ice Cream Sandwiches which was refreshing. Wish the server was more hospitable",

I was surprised when it came on a bed of red sauce, that was awful. It tasted like a cinnamon curry sauce and totally ruined the chicken.

    "text": "I went here for my birthday dinner, family member's treat.  I looked at the website before we went and was encouraged by the dress code bit: hubby and I were looking to dress up on this special occasion.   The night of my birthday, we walk in, dressed to the nines, and immediately notice that we're surrounded by tacky beach shirts, wrinkly khaki shorts, and seen-better-days Birkenstocks.  I have no problem with casual attire, okay?  I actually *prefer* it.  But if you're literally going to state on the restaurant website that a dress code applies, shouldn't you kinda sorta try to enforce it so the rest of us don't feel like schmucks?  Then comes the food.  We paid almost $80 for what would be appetizer portions in any other restaurant.  Seriously, we left hungry, and literally ordered giant-sized pizza and gelato as soon as we left this place.  The portions are ridiculously small for their ridiculous price, and while the food wasn't bad, it certainly wasn't worth the price tag.  And here's my real pet peeve of the evening: they *knew* it was my birthday, even asked me about it, and still didn't bring me even a little scoop of overpriced ice cream as a little bday treat.  Is this what happens in absurdly overpriced-for-what-it-is restaurants?  Because I can tell you, I've never in my life not seen any kind of treat offered to the birthday girl/boy/whatever. It's not about the treat -- it's about the thought.  It was rude and cheap of them, and we left there disappointed and turned off, but most of all, really, really hungry.",

Back to the service: our cocktails were priced on the higher end, but the generous pour, top shelf ingredients, and great bar tending made them a value. Both my wife and I were still working on our drinks halfway through the meal, and our server brought new chilled glasses and poured the last 1/4 into the new glass. What a nice touch.

WHAT? The cornbread seemed to have shrunk as well (though still more than enough) - and it didn't taste as good as it has in years past. Maybe just our order, but on top of my million dollar salad, it added to the disappointment.  Still good food, but with price increases, there are so many other great places in the area, we will now be checking them out vs. coming here next time ...  Thanks for the memories ....",

    "text": "A friend recommended Bandera to me.  First, point in their favor - they take reservations.  We arrived on time and they seated us right away.  I had heard that their appetizer cornbread was not to be missed and so we ordered it to start.  Delicious in flavor and unique in presentation,  I loved the fact that the cornbread tasted like corn *emphasis-on-the-corn* bread and not corn flavored cake.  The green chilies were a fabulous compliment.  The prompt service and delivery of our food was the second point in their favor.  I ordered the roasted chicken and the barbeque beef rib with coleslaw and my dinner companion ordered the carnitas sandwich with braised pork and rio grande glaze with a side of the shoestring fries.  My chicken was moist and extremely flavorful - real flavorful, not the \"we-added-fake-smoke-flavoring-to-the-store-bought-barbeque-sauce-we-slopped-all-over-your-chicken\" flavor.  One of the three ribs on my plate was a little over done.  I'm all for cooking the ribs until the meat falls off the bone, but please stop when it starts to turn to charcoal.   The best part of the dinner was the coleslaw and that's saying something, because I hate coleslaw.  It was unlike any coleslaw I've ever tried.  It wasn't a mayo based coleslaw rather it was shredded cabbage with a touch of cilantro and what looked to be fresh spinach mixed with an oil based dressing that had a touch of chili powder.  It was then topped with crushed peanuts.  A savory and unique dish.  Bandera's food was deliciously memorable. Its service was prompt and thorough.  I'll be visiting Bandera's  again in the very near future.",

Everything was cooked to perfection. Having a chef for a son, we are no strangers to fabulous food and Bandera has fabulous food.",

We went with friends for their prime rib which we love and got there early at 6 o'clock with a party of 6 all craving prime rib. When we ordered our prime rib they informed us that they had run out. What a disappointment it was only 6 p.m. so the next best thing as they said was the chicken and ribs which we all ordered. What another disappointment. The chicken was dry and cold and the ribs were overcooked. Did this company sell out?",

My friend was trying to get us a drink from the bar, when a girl went out of her way to take our order (come to find out she was a manager walking by).  Talk about excellent customer service!  Dinner was excellent - I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly.  It came with brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes; I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts, but they were awesome.  The others had the rotisserie chicken which was really juicy and favorable.  Alex was our waiter and he did an excellent job, even though the place was really hopping.  Definitely check it out - you'll be thrilled.  Oh, I forgot to mention the cornbread skillet is the best too!",

A little pricey....Also surprised that a prime dip wasn't on the menu. The wine list was limited and quite pricey, although the tempranillo was perfectly smooth and very addicting.    The crispy cornbread was excellent and the Bandera chicken sandwich was delectable. The roasted peppers I had as a side were a bit oily for my liking.   I'll definitely be back.

We had, I can't remember the exact name, Pork Sandwich (avocado, bbq sauce) & Ribs (they were going to take them off of the menu soon).

This place does seem to get busy so try to get there as early as possible if you do not want to wait.   We walked past where they were making the chicken and the smell from that alone pretty much sealed the deal as to what I was going to order. We did start off with the cornbread which was absolutely amazing. I would definitely recommend getting that as an appetizer.   We all ordered the rotisserie chicken as stated and it did not disappoint. It was so juicy and tender and the sauce that they had on it was absolutely amazing. By far the best rotisserie chicken I have had in a long long time. The green rice it came in was pretty darn good as well. After we stuffed ourselves my friends dad insisted on dessert so we got the oreo with the ice cream which did not fail to disappoint as well. In all, a great meal. I would definitely recommend this for a casual dinner out with a family or even a date.",

Anything that they cook on the rotisserie out back tastes awesome and the drink list is nothing to laugh at with only the best bartenders with top shelf liquors! Bandera also can cater your events or call for take out but make sure that you call ahead since everything is prepared fresh and you don't want them to run out ; ) Two of my favorite foods here are the mac and cheese and the chicken and ribs dish which gives you a taste of both worlds!

Don't expect to be stuffed after this dish, it is filling though (especially after the dip duo and cornbread). The other dishes that were ordered were the salmon and the chicken sandwich. Both of these dishes received raving reviews - not a bad word to say about either (hard to come by when you're in a group!)  This restaurant has a very lively ambiance and is always packed during Spring Training. I recommend making a reservation. However, do not be surprised when you have to wait ~10 minutes for a table.

After my last meal there the perceived value was shattered. Tiny portions of everything from chicken to potatoes and vegies. The avocado salad was kind of a joke and certainly not shareable.   I think the wine is overpriced because they serve a 4 ounce pour and at 11 bucks, a small glass of a grocery store Chardonnay is a bit much.  Service is always predictable and by that I mean fast very fast as in eat and go please. It's rarely kind and personable but at the same time never bad, because the severs are obviously trained to turn there tables professionally.  This use to be my go to restaurant in Old town, but I find myself choosing others now. I wish Bandera was great again.",

The food was outstanding! We ordered the cornbread app (sweet, crumbly goodness) and the dip duo (guac and spicy queso dip) with very few chips. They were kind enough to bring us more chips on request at no additional charge. For dinner most of us ordered the rotisserie chicken with mashed potatoes. Huge portions at only $17/each - pretty good deal for fine dining! Drinks were standard. Margarita was a little weak for $10 - lots of ice.  The loss of two stars is a result of terrible, grumpy service. Our waitress, Vanessa K, put on the smile, but you could tell she was really hating her job last night. I don't know why - we ordered plenty of food and drinks, you'd think she'd be excited for the tip? Not so much. She was very short spoken with our group and at no point offered to do anything for us, we constantly had to request service.   I would recommend the food, just not the service.

I've become accustomed to ordering the skillet cornbread as an appetizer. It is buttery with a kick and the top is sweet and crunchy. Together, this makes it for one of the best cornbreads you'll ever have. My go-to-dish is the meatloaf which is filled with a juicy mushroom flavor and goes perfect with their garlic mashed potatoes. The enchiladas are worth a try as well and my husband most recently enjoyed the prime rib.   They have a descent selection of beers with a few on draft. Lots of good wine to choose from and even some signature drinks such as the Caipirinha filled with cachaca, sugar cane, and lime. Although having too many of these can become pricey rather fast, definitely worth a try. This was similar to a mojito, but better in my opinion.   Finally, they currently offer an Oreo cookie sandwich dessert. The chocolate cookie was interesting- not identical to an Oreo, but similar. The ice cream was homemade and the entire thing sat in a warm bed of espresso sauce with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Definitely worth a try!",

    "text": "I had some clients in town and someone suggested Banderas. I had never been there so thought we would give it a try. Call them around noon and made a reservation at 7:15 pm for 9 people. A couple of the people in our party had gone to the Waste Management Open that day but the rest of us went to the restaurant directly from work. We arrived around 6:45 and had a beer while we waited for our table which was finally ready around 730pm. At that time they informed us that they could not accept parties larger than 5 or 6 and they would  be sitting us a two different tables. We asked if they could just push two tables together and we were told no!   The hostess sat the first table of 4 and then came back for the rest of us a few minutes later. She asked where the rest of our party was in which I said that they were all seated or outside on the phone and that they could go ahead and seat us. The hostess refused to seat us and said that she needed to make sure we only sat 5 people at our table. That was the sole reason she wouldnt go ahead and seat us. She could not trust that we would sit 5 person per table. Frustrated and upset I informed her that were were all business professional adults and know how to count, that we would sit the correct amount of people per table. She finally sat us.  The waitress brought us waters and asked if we wanted anything, at that time we ordered apps. She came back later while I was in the middle of a conversation with one of my clients and when I didn't acknowledge her right away I noticed she stormed off with nasty look on her face. About 10 minutes later, she returned and asked if we were ready to order, we said yes, the first question was from my wife who asked what the house soup was, in which she said \"we don't have one\" in a rude way. One of my clients tried to order the grilled artichokes which is highlighted on the menu as a specialty, the waitress said \" we are out of that too\" so he picked something else. I ordered last and asked for the house special French Dip, she replied \"Oh we are out of that too.\" It took me a minute to find another dish as the menu was not to my liking.   A few minutes later after the waitress left I commented to the table about the bad service from her. I clearly pointed out the fact that she was rude, did not talk to the table about any restaurant specials or inform us what the kitchen was out of, I told the table she was not very good at her job. While I was talking about her i did not realize she was at a server station behind me, listening the whole time. About 5 mins later she returned to the table to bring silverware, my wife asked if she could have another Margarita. At that time the waitress informed us that she was cutting off the whole table, I informed her politely that all most of us where on our first or second drink. (One of my clients had been to the PHX Open that day and was buzzed but very quiet). She reiterated that we were cut off. I replied that I would like to see the manager. When the manager came I calmly explained to her the whole experience, situation and fact that the server cut us off because I made a comment that she was a bad waitress, that she was merely being vindictive and retaliatory because of my comment and while the manager understood she did support her server by stating   \"I am not going to go against my server.\" In the same breath, she looked at my wife and said I'm sure we can get you another margarita, (because we were not intoxicated) but it never came.  Based on this incredibly poor experience I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

    "text": "Let's pretend for a moment that we're bigshots! We want huge steaks, giant glasses of wine, and beautiful waitresses serving us. It's Friday night and we're getting drunk. That's the feeling at Bandera. Excess is normal and we love it!  Bandera intends to be a serious steakhouse, but they only have three steaks on the menu. That's pretty good compared to the rest of Arizona though. I ordered the fillet mignon with spiced curry powder. Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare), the curry powder was balanced, providing a nice zip that vanished as soon as it was detected. The grill masters really know their stuff, as the wood fire grill provides a beautiful aromatic char.  My entree came with a gargantuan piece of broccoli, fitting the theme of excess, as well as an accompaniment of shoestring fries. The fries were thin, crispy, and dainty, being the only reminder to an outside world where things aren't always super-sized. It was a great balance to everything else that evening.   Service is gorgeous and polite. At the bar, the wait staff is a bit hectic as they need to handle two types of requests at the same time. But it's forgivable and the food more than makes up for it.  Highly recommended if you're a voracious carnivore.",

I tried the classic margarita no salt which was so yummy my husband traded me his grapefruit tequila martini drink.  Loved them both and the dip duo- Steve offered to bring more chips but the amount served was good for us.  One dip is a cheesy cold salty yumminess and the second dip is a chunky freshly prepared guacamole.  For our entree we shared the tri tip and enchilada.  The enchilada was Melty cheese and some spinach I think but it was the highlight served with half green sauce and half red.  The tri top was seasoned perfectly and charred in the edges.  A little chopped salad is served with this which has a nice broad range of veggies from cauliflower, onions, cucumbers, and a goat cheese crumble.  Our favorite dish was the banana Creme pie!  We had 2 rounds of coffee and enjoyed the casual festive ambiance.  We overheard the table next to us inquire about the rotisserie chicken which apparently is marinated 72 hrs in citrus and then slowly rotisseried.  Going to try that next time!",

The Jackrabbit is probably the best on their menu and would greatly recommend it.   Another night i went back for appetizers, dinner and dessert. For appetizers we had their Iron Skillet Cornbread, and Seafood cocktail. Both were excellent in their own way. Then for dinner I had Ahi Tuna with Shiitake Ponzu, and that was probably one of the best tasting things I've ever ate. Savory, and wonderful all around. It was unbelievably good. The Dessert we had name skips my mind, but it was like a cookie ice cream, and it was excellent as well.   The over all look of the establishment is homey and welcoming, bery beautiful to look at and be in. The staff is very friendly and willing to help make your stay worth its money.   If you are in the east valley, or willing to make a trip this place is well worth its money. Would greatly recommend to anyone.",

    "text": "If you like to overpay and dine in what looks like a Chlli's then this is the place for you! Bandera is NOT a Mexican restaurant which one would think based on the name but it's not lol. The menu has a lot of meat dishes. A few salads that are roughly $20 each. Not justifiable in my opinion.   The special the night we were there was a pork dish that was on the regular menu but was discounted $6 or so. Huh? Is your pork going bad or did you get a good deal on pork this week? Just odd never heard of such a thing. And the $6 discount was not even close to being enticing.    Our waitress was not 100% there she was scatterbrained and tried to play it off in a funny manner. Not funny tho.   The appetizer dip duo for the table was very small for 4 people. It was approximately 1 ice cream scoop of guacamole. Sad.   Parking: Street parking, no valet. However, in walking distance to many other local spots and hotels. Or you can Lime or Byrd scooter here. They're all over Scottsdale.   Overall I was not thrilled with this dinner at all margaritas were made well but still $13 steep for Arizona. You can get awesome margaritas in NYC for $8-10. Would not dine here again if it wasn't for a work function. Again my apologize for lack of photos. It was a work function and not appropriate for me to be snapping away throughout the dinner.

It was actually only about 10 and we were sat!   Service wasn't fantastic. Our waiter never brought us water, and dirty plates were left in front of us for a while. When our appetizer was dropped off, a girl who wasn't our waiter dropped it off at the table and placed the small plates in front of me instead of giving my husband one. They also added random charges to our bill that weren't ours. When we brought it to our servers attention he removed it, but I figure he would have noticed most of the items on there weren't ordered by us  Food was very good! However, you can never go wrong with a hillstone restaurant. The meat of my ribs just fell right off the bone. It had a fantastic taste. The chicken was very juicy but not as flavorful as I'd hoped.   Overall a good restaurant for a date night or dinner with friends. I would definitely return if in the area.",

Now it is served dumped upside down on a 6\" plate.  The portion size is smaller, the quality has gone down and the yummy crusted top is no longer.  Sad.   My chicken was undercooked and bloody at the bone.   Worse than that, men are no longer allowed to wear a hat in the restaurant.

Reminder, you're a rotisserie chicken restaurant- not even a tablecloth restaurant.    The American male is under attack in this country and it's a sad sad state of affairs.

    "text": "So the service was not 'bad', it was just 'off'.    Unfortunately, service misses stand out when you are part of the Hillstone Restaurant Group.  The 2016 glowing, multi-page article in a popular cooking magazine set my expectations high and those expectations have typically been met over the past few years.        As we were seated I mentioned the cold draft I could feel coming down from the ceiling and we were told it would warm up as it got busier.   The hostess continued by asking if  I would like something warm to drink.  I declined and said I would just have some water.    Did she take this as a special one-off request for water?    Because the next thing you know she returned with a glass of water for me and no one else at the table.     Drinks were ordered......The sparkling wine failed to appear with the other drinks.  Our friend waited, and waited and eventually had to ask about it.     I ordered the Kale Salad with the dressing on the side.   Our server took the order and returned a few minutes later to tell me the salad could not be served without any dressing.   Hmmm.   Ok, maybe they dress the Kale in bulk to let it soften up?    The salad came, and I was taking my first bite when another server appeared with a salad saying it had no dressing and I could have it if I wanted it.   I had already started eating the one I had, and the idea of wasting the entire bowl of food did not sit well with me, so I said I would eat the one I had.     Ignoring the hiccups in the service, the food was flavorful, consistent, and served at a nice pace.",

Our drinks were never empty.   The food was quick.  Awesome!! We chose the cornbread {{because you cannot skip this}} and the Brussels sprouts.   They were THE BEST Brussels sprouts we ever had.   They weren't too crispy, too greasy or too rich.   The were steamed then grilled & pure magic.  We will be back soon to try the artichoke when they are in season, but we were NOT sad that the sprouts were our option.   They were delish.    For dinner we shared the chicken & rib combo.   It was yummy but 4 star yummy.   Next time we will for sure try the salmon.   If we weren't so completely stuffed we would have just gotten the CORNBREAD for dessert.   It was that good people!!",

Couldn't describe dishes beyond the bare basics and didn't seem comfortable standing by the table. Ordered the margarita but it was pure salt with a touch of lime water. Overpriced for low quality and low quantity.  Menu is very basic but they were out of multiple things. Took us 3 tries to order something they had. Ordered the filet that is paired with a Caesar and mash potatoes. Filet is advertised as prime but tasted no different from a choice cut and not the top 2% of cuts that are prime grade.   We were celebrating a birthday but were given the check without being offered desserts. I don't expect a dessert on the house but being that we were celebrating a birthday we would have liked to have done dessert. At this point we just chalked it up that this restaurant is mediocre at best and we decided to go somewhere nice for dessert.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been a regular Bandera customer for over 20 years.  Dining there was a special event.  When out of town guests come, one of our favorite outings is to take them to dinner at Banderas ... but, sadly, likely no more. Several years ago they stopped offering their absolutely delicious and unique Irish mashed potatoes and instead plop regular nothing-special mashed potatoes on your plate.  But we still came back because the menu items were excellent ... and the main draw was their large skillet corn bread. For decades their corn bread was consistently prepared, tasty, moist and large enough for four people.  It was served at the table hot in a cast iron skillet.  Moist, tasty, large enough for four people. When we ordered it on August 21 to our surprise the waitress came with a small half sized cast iron skillet, turn it over and plopped the 'corn bread' onto a small butter (or dessert) dish. I thought I was at a IHOP restaurant, not a classier evening-out restaurant.  Their revamped corn bread was tasteless, than half the size, and DRY and crumbly as you can see in the photo.  I would never order it again, not worth the cost and certainly not worth the calories.   Since their Irish potatoes (no longer served) and the delicious corn bread are now history ... so are we as a customer.  The dining experience I was used to and willing to pay for is no longer worth it.  This is sad because there are not that many nice moderately priced sit-down restaurants in which to enjoy a relaxing meal (a nice change from the Pubs and fast casual restaurants which are a bit tiresome after a while).",

I've never had a cold queso dip. I expected a skillet of hot bubbly cheese and a got a plate of ground, cold cheese. Moving on...the ribs were absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back to try other menu items and opt for the Oreo cookie dessert.",

    "text": "I lived in Sacramento for many years and the Bandera there was my all time favorite restaurant. I also frequent the one in Brentwood and love it. On our recent trip to Scottsdale, we returned to this location and it really was not up to the usual Bandera standards.   To begin with, we had a reservation. We arrived on time and the hostess did not look up from her mobile phone to greet us, in fact never said a word to us, just looked at the reservation screen and then spoke to a server and said \"I only have table # such and such left\" and the server then grabbed menus and asked us to follow her to a very small two seater table near the restrooms. Oh well, not the end of the world, but we felt like an afterthought.  I started with an awesome martini and our salads and perfect cornbread came out in a hurry. I ordered the meatloaf as my entree and it came out stone cold and not quite cooked thru. Our server was no where to be found, I even tried flagging down another one, who looked right at me and kept walking. Not the usual Bandera experience! Finally found someone to take my plate, and told my husband to go ahead and eat his ribs, which were very good. The manager brought my plate back to me about 10 minutes later, and apologized profusely, she was lovely and said she was taking the meal off the check. I didn't expect that, but in the end was glad she did as the meatloaf was hot on the outside and not quite warm and very mushy in the middle.   None of this would keep me from going back, I am loyal. But this location might benefit from this feedback.",

The cornbread was absolutely great and I loved how the queso complemented the guac in the dip duo.   I ordered myself a margarita to go with my dinner. It was a pretty great margarita, as the sweet and tartness was well balanced in the drink. I also got the BBQ beef ribs. They were cooked to perfection and though not so tender that they would fall right off the bone. I subbed the cole slaw that comes with the dish for the cucumber salad. I think this was a great choice as the cucumber salad was very refreshing and great flavors with some goat cheese. Since we were there celebrating a birthday, we got both of the available desserts, the banana cream pie an Oreo cookie. For me the True winner here was the banana caramel pie - I'm not a big fan of overly sweet desserts and this dessert was a great way to end the meal.   This was my first time here, so when I looked up the restaurant and saw they had a dress code, I was expecting it to be a little more upscale than it actually was. It seems like the dress code is hardly enforced and to me that seems like they're trying to be more upscale than they actually are.",

Bandera reminds me of Houstons (same owners?) and has a gorgeous layout and open kitchen that give the place a great energy.  Their specials are well rounded for the fish lovers, just in case someone doesn't want a big slab of moo, and their appetizers are good enough to have just as the meal.  Desserts are straight-forward and well executed.  Round that out with a decent wine list (a lot of the wines are by the glass, which is HUGE) and a full bar that knows how to do your drink and you have a bar that gets a \"solid\" rating.    It's location makes it easy to walk to quite a few other restaurants or bars and of course downtown Scottsdale and \"The Waterfront\"  are one of the best places to hang out in America for the evening.",

I managed a Starbucks for a year and the coffee used at Banderas is far better. They are so great- they bring chilled cream to your table for the coffee!! Real cream, not junky crap. Its just delicious. Dont miss the roasted artichoke appetizer! I had the salmon dinner and it was cooked properly and was nicely seasoned. The dinner items didnt blow me away, but they were good.  Definitely recommend as a cool place to go without small children. Dim lighting, comfortable tables/booths, and friendly staff. I enjoy going to Bandera just for the coffee and dessert! :-)",

Simply put its like ninja's with water jugs because everytime I'd look my glass as always full!  Honestly I love that.  Great atmosphere for a business dinner or formal quiet celebration.  Drink selection is accomodating for any taste and I'm always a return diner at any time of the year.",

Bandera came as a recommendation and the prices were not too bad.  25 for some pretty good prime rib isn't too bad especially when you can expense it.  The wait time was about 10 minutes, but I can really see how this place can be super crowded on weekends.    I didn't try the chicken, but the other 3 folks who ordered it enjoyed it.",

    "text": "Scottsdale has some pretty standard restaurants I could find back in CA: Mastro's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Wildfish, etc.  Bandera was a safe choice for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had a slightly different menu than the one I go to in Corona del Mar.  We started off with the grilled artichokes with a garlic aoli sauce, deviled eggs, and, of course, the infamous cornbread.  The grilled artichokes were standard fare, simply grilled and seasoned but tasty nonetheless.  The deviled eggs were ok, there were parts of the yolk that hadn't cooked fully through and were slightly congealed.  Also, the filling was a bit too acidic for my tastes.  The cornbread, however, was perfection.  A heaping, crumbly carb filled with corn, queso, and jalepeno.  Yum.  I almost finished the whole pan, that's how yummalicious it was.  If you go here, you must, must, must order the cornbread.    For dinner, I had the grilled loup de mer with a side of tabbouleh and mac n cheese.  The loup de mer was grilled perfectly, was very tasty. The tabbouleh was good, not too lemony and the parsley was in perfect balance.  The mac n cheese is my absolute fave here at Bandera.  The shells are perfectly al dente, the cheese isn't too cheesy, and they top it off with panko bread crumbs.  Ahhh, a dish after my heart.  This is a must have, IMO.  My friend had the ribs and they were super yummy, but I'm not really a ribs kinda gal.  If you dig ribs though, they were falling off the bone, no knife needed.   All in all, it was a pretty good dining experience.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale though, I'll try something a little more adventurous.",

The cornbread and artichoke is excellent (the best artichoke my husband ever tried... keep in mind he's only eaten it with me).  The Cesar salad is excellent. I think they use the cornbread as croutons. Yummy!  The ribs are my favorite here. I haven't tried anything else because the above appetizers and ribs are too much food for me.  I would have given this place 5 stars BUT they CHANGED the peanut coleslaw recipe!!!   NOOO.......  I don't like cole slaw, but their peanut one was incredible. I would order extra sides of it, because it was so delicious.  I haven't been here for ~1 year, and the cole slaw turned into a salad kind of thing with peanuts sprinkled on top.  awful.... it was not very good.  What a disappointment. Don't know anyone who makes coleslaw like that. It was incredible. I wish it would come back....",

I don't drink so i love to have a coke with my dinner. The waitress tried to make it sound better by telling us the bottles were cute and we could save them as a souvenir.  Well I don't think people going to Banderas are the type  to display coke bottles in their living room.  So I spent 10 bucks on soda that night.  Even at $3 a soda they are making bank.  I think they are trying to be trendy and different but this just ends up being stupid.  Talk about being out of touch they probably still use a typewriter to type the menu.  Save some money and aggravation and go to Roaring Fork where they will refill your coke all day long for one reasonable price.",

They sat us quickly and I really like the ambiance and feel of the place.  Our server seemed okay in the beginning. Very knowledgeable and efficient...at first.  She got us our drinks and brought us amazing jalapeno cornbread. Then it went downhill very quickly.  First, not once did she refill our drinks.  Second, she forgot one of the meals and it took her twenty minutes to come back and figure it out!! Then it took forever to get our ticket. Then even longer to get our card back!  Service was the minus two stars of this review.  As for our food? My salad was perfection. The best of salty and sweet and crispy. Three ordered the filet and they said it was cooked perfect, the potatoes were creamy and even thought the brussel sprouts were yum! One had the Caesar and it was big and looked great. The last of us had the enchiladas and she licked the plate clean!  I'm guessing just get carryout and you'll have a five star experience?",

Maybe that's one of the reasons we keep coming back here so often! As many new restaurants as we try, very few measure up to this place. There are so many things I love about Bandera I need to make a list, paragraph form just won't cut it. 1. Consistency. In my experience very few restaurants can pull off making the same dish exactly the same way every single time. Bandera does. We go back over and over again for our favorites and it always tastes exactly the way it's supposed to. 2. Food. It's amazing. Some of our favorites:      -grilled artichokes      - corn bread (my arteries hate me afterwards but seriously, best corn bread ever)      -macho salad      - crispy chicken sandwich      - peanut cole slaw      - every single fresh seasonal vegetable they serve      - banana cream pie 3. Service. Always friendly. Always knowledgable. Love that I can start a tab at the bar while I wait for dinner and they transfer it to the dinner table, no questions asked. And yes, the bartender is tipped out appropriately on this transfer so I don't have to worry about that.  4. Take out. It's hard to find take out that tastes as good at home as it does in the restaurant. Sometimes you just want to eat something delicious in your pajamas and on your couch! And as many times as we have ordered take out from Bandera (and it's been a lot of times) they have never once messed up our order or forgotten anything. Seriously! That never happens but here, it just does.   So, long story longer, we love Bandera. If you've been hopefully you've had the same amazing experiences we have. If you haven't been, GO! And order yourself a home made margarita while waiting for dinner, it's amazing.",

    "text": "Basically, this is a fancy grill in Old Town Scottsdale.  The food four star but the prices, crowds, and awkward hostess team drops it a star.  I had the chicken and ribs - the ribs were very small, there were only two, but they were very moist and well cooked.  The honey mustard sauce was tasty but a bit overpowering.  The chicken, which is apparently their signature, was pretty run of the mill.  Not sure how they did it but the skin on the chicken wasn't crispy - it was soggy - which is hard to do on a rotisserie.    Now, the awkward hostess and waitin time.  We arrived at 7pm for dinner and was told it would be 75 minutes.  Normally a non-starter but we walked the town and it was fine. A friend of ours decided to join us so we notified the restaurant and they said that adding another person would push the wait to 2.5 hours becuase there are a limited number of tables for 6.  Gulp.  I explained that two in our party are children (aged 2 and 4) and didn't need a full seat.  that seemed to really confuse the hostess ... she reminded me a few times that the wait is 2.5 hours and that we'd still need a party of 6.  Even though they're tiny, would likely be sleeping in the stroller anyway, and the booth style seating meant there'd be plenty of space if we needed it.After speaking to a manager I convinced them to let us take a table for 5 and all was saved.  But let's just say that the hostesses should work on being less awkward and more flexible.",

We arrived hungry so the all too memorable smell wafted in the air. We had a drink at the bar and did not wait long at the bustling bar. The bartenders are on it here! Great service!   Once seated, we ordered the grilled jumbo artichoke. So good! The corn bread is good too! I had the aged prime rib with mash potatoes ($26) and veggies. The Mrs. had Chicken enchilada ($15) that was meh. Wine was good, service was awesome! No room for desert.   We forgot that there is good people watching here too.

Skillet cornbread: try it, you'll love it! -not related to the restaurant, but in a great area, Old Town Scottsdale, nice place to walk around in the evening. -they ban cell phones! Yup, means I can't check my email or fantasy baseball stats, but made for an enjoyable dinner as the ambiance was strictly human conversation. -rotisserie chicken: enjoyed it with the green rice and paired with a great white wine.  Why no fifth star: -good portion for me for the chicken, others might find it small; if so, get the chicken/ribs combo -no sound on the tvs at the bar. -not a large variety of steaks on the menu, more of a nice restaurant than a steakhouse  Overall, really liked the food here; would definitely come back here or visit the one in Sac or Chicago just for the cornbread!",

They are famous for their wood-fired rotisserie chicken.  I wasn't a fan of the thin french fries though.  The burgers are also delicious too. Overall a great place to meet friends or go on a date with great food.  Although I don't believe they have any outside seating.",

My personal favorites are the roasted artichokes, jalapeno cornbread (served in an iron skillet), Caesar salad with a creamy dressing with just a hint of Southwest. I also enjoyed the prime rib (med-rare). My friends enjoyed their salad, chicken enchilada a la carte and roasted chicken. Service was attentive and friendly, but would've liked to have been asked if we were done with our dishes and drinks before they so efficiently stealthed by to take them away before we were done. The only downside was waiting over an hour to be seated because we had no reservations. We were able to keep ourselves entertained at the bar while we waited, and the margaritas and mojitos were great!",

I could almost hear an angelic choir hit the high notes after my first bite.   For the main courses, we ordered the Kobe beef tips and the grilled salmon. The beef tips were the clear winner, tender, cooked to perfection, and with a nice wood-grilled flavor. The salmon was good, but the \"green rice\" that came along side of it was a little on the tangy side for me. The salmon had a sweet glaze over the top which was good, but I guess I was not in the mood for that flavor.   The bottom line is, the Yelpers were right again. This place is a winner. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I'm going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars... it was damn good!  I seriously couldn't stop eating... and lets just say I learned my lesson about over-indulging!  I was lucky enough to be invited here by a friend who's date was very food knowledgeable.... he's been in the industry for years.  So he took the liberty of ordering for us which I don't mind at all.    For starters we had the cornbread... Delicious.  It was so crusty and yummy on top and tender with a nice crumb in the middle... it had cheese corn and peppers in it and I thought it was great... def try it!  Next we had the deviled eggs... FRESH and delicious, and I'm not a huge fan of these unless my mom or gram makes them.  These had celery in them just like my mom/grams and they were perfect.  I would order this again.  Finally we had the guacamole, also very fresh.  This had corn kernels in it as well and I just loved the texture it brought to it.  The chips were house made, and NOT GREASY AT ALL... YUM!  you should have seen the chunks of avacado in this!  Beautiful.  I ordered the filet with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Our friend recommended I order it Philly style (at least I think that's what he said) which is charred on the outside and I always order my meat rare... LOL and of course the other girls at the table had to let out their \"EEEEEEEW\"'s!  I'm not sorry, that's how I LOVE my meat, RAW :)  This was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had... Just perfectly cooked, almost purple in the middle.  Apparently their meat in the best of the best, Prime Prime, not just one Prime but TWO!  Not a drop of blood on the plate, which means they rested it.  The mash was delicious as well... and the broccoli was wonderful and buttery.  My friend ordered the ribs and they were tender and sweet and just mmmmm... if you love ribs you shouldn't pass these up!  She is not a big eater and she finished the whole slab!      I almost ate all of it I'm such a pig.  I just couldn't stop eating!  But I did save room for one or two bites of the banana cream pie (my favorite!) the table shared... and it was great... I would've eaten more but I was STUFFED to the gills!  They also ordered this oreo ice cream dessert but I simply couldn't fit in another bite.  I almost forgot... I had two (the second one was ordered for me against my will) lemon drop martini's and they were very delicious but VERY strong... jeez I didn't know what hit me!  I tasted my friends' Cosmo and it was very good as well... apparently they are famous for these two cocktails.  I would go back here every week if I could!!!  Its just that good.  I'll be thinking about this meal for a while!",

For dessert we had the oreo cookie sandwiches.  Amazing!  I left feel stuffed but satisfied.

    "text": "This place was not what I was expecting. Based on the pictures and other reviews, I was anticipating \"cowboy\" style but in reality the leather booths, sleek bar area and cool, modern open kitchen were anything but rustic. Although not as classy as Cowboy Chao, this place is definitely way more upscale than the nearby Pink Pony or Saddle Ranch. I got sort of a mellow supper-club vibe from the classic cocktails on the menu and the jazz music playing in the background. There were very few people in the dining area when we ate there on Sunday evening since it was early (we arrived shortly after they opened at 4:30) but I can see how this place probably gets much more upbeat on Friday and Saturday nights.   The menu at Bandera is not really my style of food but my hubby really liked the roasted chicken and beef rib combo that he ordered. Of course, like everyone else we had to start with the cornbread and it really lived up to the hype. It was truly amazing. I ordered the Macho salad which was ok; I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it did not have WAY TOO MUCH dressing. All the flavors were good but that kind of ruined it for me. Fortunately I had ordered the artichoke appetizer as a side dish and so I was happy to munch on that instead. We were too stuffed for dessert but I did spy a couple on the menu that sounded great. I think I would love to come here another night for drinks and dessert but there are so many other good restaurants in the area that I haven't tried yet I doubt we will be back to Bandera for dinner. I wish I could give it 3 1/2 stars since it did exceed my expectations and it is a better than average restaurant but I just didn't like it as much as my 4 star places.",

Even my coworkers were impressed with my good-restaurant-picking-abilities in a strange town...thanks, fellow Yelpers!  Atmosphere-wise, it bears an uncanny resemblance to Houston's...and the cuisine isn't terribly different, either. Despite how busy it appeared to be, our party of 4 was seated immediately, and our waitress was super friendly...even chatted us up a little about where we were from, etc., and provided us with some good beer recommendations.  For starters we went with the Dip Duo with Tortilla Chips. The duo of dips turned out to be a pretty chunky guacamole, which was very refreshing, and some kind of queso dip...I'm not sure exactly what was in it, but it was very yummy...they also brought us more chips after we'd polished off the ones that originally came with the dips, which I appreciated. For dinner, I ended up ordering the fish special, which was a grilled cajun blue nose, which is, as our waitress kindly informed us, in the the snapper family and is a mild, flaky white fish. And it was JUST fabulous...I enjoyed every bite of it! It came with a little cucumber salad, which was just basically thickly sliced cucumbers tossed with a light dressing that had cilantro and corn in it...and some other stuff that I can't identify, but it complemented the fish wonderfully.   Obviously my meal wasn't probably the classic Bandera meal, what with the lack of steak and all, but my experience was nothing but good, so 4 stars it is! I noticed they have a Brentwood location, so I might have to check it out once I'm back home...maybe I'll give one of their steaks a try!",

I wanted the meatloaf but they were sold out. I then ordered Bandera-style Roasted Chicken.  It was very good.  I love watching their chickens roasting outside.  A cool place.

This is one of the few restaurants that can draw you in by olfactory senses alone, thanks to a giant outside rotisserie that seems to excite your senses and it only gets better.  The food is simply wonderful, I recommend trying the Southwest Corn bread appetizer to start off the evening and all of the entrees are extraordinarily well done. I have dined at Bandera numerous times with everyone from in-laws to business associates trying numerous dishes including fish, chicken, lamb, and steaks. The lamb will melt in your mouth, the chicken is wonderful, and the steaks enchilada style are sizzling in more ways than one!   It's been a wonderful experience each time as far as the food and the atmosphere. The lighting is wonderful, it casts a very warm flattering glow over the ugliest of my friends and it is definitely a place to take a date or celebrate with friends. Well over 95% of the time the service is spot on, they are responsive, friendly, accurate, etc.  but there have been a few small preventable mistakes (the nights in question were very busy so it is somewhat understandable).",

We got there at approx 5pm and they got us in right away no wait.   We were seated near the kitchen which is right in the middle  but I was fine with that since I was entertained with all the culinary artistry that was going on.  I ordered the Barbecue Salmon with Green Rice and Mexican Cucumber Salad and the husband ordered the Roasted Chicken &  Barbecue Beef Rib Combo, instead of coleslaw substituted for the spinach.    I sort consider myself a savvy salmon lover and I give the salmon here an A, it was cooked to perfection.  My husband had no complaints and he enjoyed his choice of food as well.  We did order the cornbeard and we requested it to come out with our meal and I agree with all the previous reviews, the cornbread is yummy.",

Oddly, my friend also ordered the fillet and 15 minutes later mine came out, and a minute after that my friend got the manager instead of the fillet.  The manager explained that they ran out of fillets (they had also been out of chicken but we knew that pre-ordering).  They apologize, took a wine off the check, and blasted a prime rib out after about 3 minutes wait (sorry person who had that snagged from the heat lamps).  Nice service save.",

My mom was visiting from Los Angeles and wanted to head to dinner in Oldtown Scottsdale. After nixing The Mission due to deafening noise level, we headed to Bandera where we had a fabulous dinner. Started with the deviled eggs (they were okay - I am not a fan of surprise celery in anything-  but needed a little more spice.) Skip these and get the skillet cornbread! I had the filet mignon with seasonal veg (broccoli) and mashed potatoes and the mom had the Loup de Mer (seabass) with marcona almonds and herbs plus veggies. The fish and steak were both perfectly cooked. We also got a couple very well balanced cocktails and the nice, unobtrusive waitress brought out additional chilled martini glasses to keep our drinks cold during dinner. I am looking forward to going back as the view of the open concept kitchen has convinced me I have to try a lot more of their menu!",

Walked in at 6:45. 4 adults and 2 small-ish kids. The restaurant was empty with large booths around the perimeter that were desolate. There are ONLY 2 booths in the entire over priced rotisserie chicken joint that accommodate 6 people and they are on a first-come-first-serve basis. Both were filled.  However when I asked about the uninhabited LARGE booths I was told we we could not sit there because \"That's not how their restaurant functions\". After asking for the manager and hearing his lame excuse of why he can't seat us in the booth that would spontaneously combust if the 6 of us sat there we decided to take our business else ware. Good luck with that small minded business model Bandera. When you are looking for 6 hungry deep pocketed patrons to fill your failing chicken joint, we will be down the street enjoying our dinner and laughing.",

I have made it a must visit and never missed coming here the 20 something times I have visited the Phoenix area. But I recently visited the restaurant and had a very disturbing experience. I checked in with the hostess and was asked if so had a reservation,and replied that so did not know they took reservations. She told me that they don't in busy months, but do in slower ones.She said that she would be able to seat us ( my girlfriend and I) in 15 to 20 minutes, which I said thank you! We then stood and watched MULTIPLE PEOPLE come through the door and were all seated within 10 to 15 minutes while They continued to pass by us, and basically ignore us. After 45 minutes of patiently waiting I went to the hostess and asked when we would be seated. I was informed it would be about 30 more minutes. Finally 10 minutes later ( after everyone but us were seated) we were seated.( The blonde manager seemed really put off towards us, slammed down a couple glasses of water on our table, and rudely marched away!   We felt so DISRESPECTED , and killed the great mood we were in before entering the restaurant!  We decided this place did not deserve our hard earned money and got up quietly and walked out! I felt I should leave this review so other people won't feel the snobbery we were treated to. This is depressing to me because I bragged to all my friends that I have brought here how great this place is. Sadly though this bad experience  has soured me, and will not return. People should be treated equal, and we dressed nice.but must not have  met their snobby Scottsdale expectations...RESPECT PEOPLE",

I had the prime rib and thought it had no flavor to it, the raw horseradish had zero kick to it and the broccoli tasted like I was eating a tart lemon, just odd. Very disappointed!

My entree was the prime rib, which was ridiculous (-ly good). At first I wanted to order the BBQ Salmon, but then I thought, \"Wait, I'm in the middle of the desert, I'm not ordering fish!\" But the waitress suggested the salmon appetizer, so I figured I'd give it a shot - see what a talented chef can do with desert salmon.   Best salmon I've ever had...in the middle of the ******* desert.   That one little anecdote is just a taste of the care and talent Bandera brings to its food. Everything was awesome. Ribs? Sure. Pick it up, take a bite, and oh, all the meat falls off of the bone because it's tender AF. My dining companions had good things to say about the chicken and cornbread, but to be honest I was in too much of a salmon/rib/prime rib haze to comprehend actual words.   Bandera's bar game is pretty on-point, too. They have a good scotch selection, the old fashioned's are a little sweet for my taste - but everyone has their opinion - and my aunt is in love with their lemon drop martinis. I would like to see a bigger wine list, but that's just the wine snob in me. The Syrah I ordered went great with my meal.   In conclusion: quit readin' Yelp. Instead, eat the food, drink the drinks, Bandera = good, I'll fight you if you disagree with me, end of story.",

Fantastic steaks, had a great wine pairing, and they brought us more blue cheese olives upon request, twice!!!  Totally coming back.",

There were no remarks of delight during the meal or the ride home about the food so I will surmise that it was average.   Go to Blanco it's is much better.",

Apparently bandara has a dress code (no hats, tanks), whatever that's understandable. (At the same time this place isn't Mastro's). One of the my guests had a bag which was placed next to the booth, this created a huge problem with the staff. He had moved his bag twice and the hostess came over to our table 3 separate times to Intrude on conversation and hassle us about the bag. Halfway through my salad I pulled a long blonde hair out of my mouth which came from my food. I told the manager about this and she looked at me like I had three heads. I'm VIP security at a high end club and my friend is the AGM at the same place. I would love to buy the management a table at our place of work and give you your first bottle on me so we can teach you proper customer service, you need it. Absolutely terrible!",

Don't miss the cornbread, it was spectacular.  It was warm, moist, tasty, delicious! I couldn't make up my mind between the chicken and the ribs, so i got both.  I'm not one to eat a lot of roasted chicken when i was out, but this was very good.  Juicy and cooked just right.  There weren't a lot of ribs, but the meat fell off the bone into my mouth.  MsD had the chicken as well and couldn't finish it, though she really liked it.  Being from South Jersey, I consider myself a bit of a corn snob.  I snickered at getting corn in Phoenix, but Bandera had it seasoned nicely with butter and garlic to make it edible.  Quite the complement from a Jersey Boy! The service was excellent, our waiter Stefan was there when we needed something, but not intrusive.  As we were walking around Old Scottsdale we ran into a couple of eastern travelers who were looking for a place to go.  We sent them to Bandera without a second thought.  Wish we could go back soon, but we'll have to wait until we're out west again.",

    "text": "I have never been so dissapointed with the service at a restaurant before. It was my friends birthday so we went to Bandera as it was suggested to us by the concierge at our hotel. We arrived at 8pm prompt which was the time we made reservations for. Appon arrival we were told it would be about 15 minutes and to have a seat at the bar and enjoy a drink. We had been drinking all day at the pool so opted not to have a drink at the bar. I scanned the room and saw at least 5 open tables. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated. We were greeted by our waitress who was very profesional but did not have much of a personality. Our food came in about 15 minutes and was good but was NOT worth the money we paid for it. We started with the Duo appetizer, which was delicious... the only good part of dinner. We had our food in front of us for about 5-10 minutes when the waitress came back and asked if we needed boxes. She did not ask if we were finished or if we needed more time but when we said we did not want a box our plates were taken immediately we didn't even have a chance to stop her. It was as if she was yanking our plates away telling us we were done instead of asking if we were finished. After that the appetizer was still on the table, so we started to munch on that a bit because they took our dinner away and then they came and took that despite us still enjoying it. The check was dropped and about 2 minutes after she returned our cards to us and we had signed our copies she took them all off the table. I have never been rushed out of a restaurant so quickly. We were seated at 8:10 and back to our hotel by 9pm. Not to mention we were still hungry after eating a $100 meal for 4 people because they did not allow us to finish. I will never go back.",

This place is one of them. Don't follow the recomendations of the rest of the herd posting here though. The chicken is probably the last thing I would order on this menu. Not that it's bad. It's actually quite good. It's just that it doesn't compare to the rest of the items on the menu. Bandera has the best Filet Mignon I have ever had. They put a worcestire & chive filet butter on top that is out of this world. There beef ribs are also the best that I have ever had. They are meaty and tender and the barbecue sauce is out of this world. Other recomendations include the barbecue salmon (or any fish that they are offering), the sliced leg of lamb, the burger (delish!)and of course the cornbread. The service is always good as well. Bandera is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale and it I would recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "I like Bandera because it offers the quintessential multi-sensory experience.  As you walk from their parking lot you're given the opportunity to experience a blast of heat put off by the intense fire roasting their rotisserie chickens.  Once inside you are offered the opportunity to watch the chefs race each order to near perfection.  Plenty of booth seating provides a great way to converse with the people you are eating with, and many seats around the bar enable you to chat it up with the staff.  And all of that leaves the food - the most important sensory experience of any restaurant.  Bandera's food is quite good and that has led me to eating there more times than I can recall.  I am by no means a connoisseur, but I feel as though I am experienced enough with Bandera to suggest some pretty solid options.  Their rotisserie chicken and cornbread (perhaps two dishes that the restaurant is best known for) are very good.  I am a big fan of ordering a grilled artichoke for my appetizer and then following that up with the chicken enchiladas.  With that dish you get all the benefits of their great chicken, but with the added variety that enchiladas offer.  Plus the management at Bandera has been altruistic enough to enable you to get an additional enchilada for $1 more.  Yet don't ask for a third enchilada for $1 because you won't get it; believe me I've tried.  And as I said just a few sentences earlier, their cornbread is really good.  So be my lemming and always order a skillet of this Bandera specialty - the jalapenos in this cornbread really set it apart.",

At night it's dimly lit and during the day they open up the windows. They have only 2 beers on tap, but both are excellent choices. Stella and Kilt Lifter my favorite beer in the universe brewed right in Tempe! Check my other reviews for more info on that beer. Anyway, they have specials every night so when I took my family the other night I ordered the apricot glazed meatloaf it was phenoninal but I tried everyones plate. So I can personally speak to...the meat loaf, sword fish, Ahi Tuna, chicken enchilada's, and the prime rib sandwhich. All of those were fantastic except the enchiladas I found those to be \"ok\", but not phenominal like the rest of the menu. For appetizers they have a duo dip (guac & cream cheese kind of dip) its very good, I also have had their deviled eggs & corn bread. Also extremely good. Everytime I have been to this place there service has been great, it is a perfect setting for a first date. I believe its a dinner only joint that opens @ 4pm. They take reservations. Enjoy!",

Since I don't get to venture here often I always choose the Macho salad. It is consistently awesome each time.   On our last visit we sampled the dip duo which consisted of some fresh guacamole and a spicy cheese concoction with some nice, salty corn tortilla chips. Yum!  My dining companion isn't in quite the rut I am in with the Macho salad. This go-round he had the roasted chicken which he devoured. It was juicy, aromatic and flavorful. I know this because some of that chicken was in my salad!  We cannot go wrong with over-stuffing ourselves with the Oreo cookie ice cream desert at the end.

Salmon very tasty and vegetable salad yummy.  We were so full but we are glad we had the banana cream pie.  Best we ever had.  The service was super.  Can't wait to go back.",

You feel as though all servers work as a team and are able to anticipate your every need.  The speed in which they get drinks, appetizers and the delicious entrees out was excellent.  We had the prime rib, wild mushroom meatloaf and the rotisserie chicken.  Couldn't decide which was best because they were all do good.  Definitely don't miss treat.  Thank you",

The service was great, we were seated right away and our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. We started with the artichokes and had the carnitas sandwich and steak and enchilada for our entrees. Everything was amazing, but hands down, the carnitas sandwich was my favorite. The restaurant was packed but the level of service didn't change a bit. Can't wait to go back!",

The service is not the best as it takes a while to place your order, but once the order has been made the food comes out quick. The skillet cornbread is amazing. Moist and flavorful. It is baked with a hard, crunchy crust and soft inside. Very nice contrast in textures. The cajun ribeye was tender. It's a decent steak, but nothing to rave about and nothing special.  However, the grilled corn on the cob was great; fresh grilled corn on the cob is always great. I will definitely come back again.",

Beef Ribs:  fall off the bone beef.  unreal.  I loved their old bbq sauce:  ask if they have any.  The mustard bbq is still excellent.  4 ribs on your plate.  Sometimes they switch up the menu and do a rib/chicken combo: just tell them you want ribs only.  Sides:  you can switch out anything.

He decided to joke around with the guy who answered the phone by asking what the lady situation was like in the restaurant. \"It's mostly a white upper class restaurant,\" we heard in reply.   After a dozen or so minutes of soul searching (should we really go give these people our money?) we decided to check it out.  To our delight, we found that it was not overly white and not very \"upper class\". We were seated immediately - the only positive segment of our outing.  We had a young, shy waitress who was nice enough but didn't seem horribly interested in making our experience enjoyable. A buddy ordered a drink which came out quickly; about 10 minutes quicker than the waters the rest of us ordered.   About 15 minutes in, we get our waters and are asked if we would like some cornbread. Now, I don't frequent \"white upper class\" joints too often but i remember bread being offered for free at some of the finer establishments I've visited. Usually when an appetizer is being offered, the waitress says something like \"can I start you off with (Appetizer A) or maybe some (Appetizer B)\" not, \"Do you want me to bring some cornbread out?\" Thinking it was free, we confirmed that, yes, we would like some cornbread. The cornbread was the best of the food we ordered (knowingly or unknowingly), so, there's that.  Three of us ordered the rotisserie chicken and ribs. One buddy ordered the prime rib - he said it was decent. The chicken was mehh. The ribs were bad enough that once I saw them I wished I hadn't ordered them. Once I bit into them, I wished I hadn't tasted them. Once I finished them...you get the idea.  Decided to wash that nastiness down with some rye:  \"Ma'am, what rye whiskeys do you have?\"  \"Ehmmmm...excuse me?\"  \"Rye whiskey...do you have?\"  \"Let me ask the bartender...\"  (15 minutes later I catch her walking by.)  \"Ma'am, did you have a chance to check on the rye?\"  \"Oh, yeah...\" (makes the long trek to the bar [we're sitting right next to it])   At that point, I didn't really want the drink but because of the terrible service, I needed it.  Maybe this whole \"white upper class\" dining experience isn't for me.",

Definitely on par with restaurants in NY, and in some cases much better than some overly hyped places in NY (I'm looking at you No. 7!) I've also heard very good things about their burgers.   The food isn't going to blow your socks off with any new unique flavor or flare. They don't have a Picasso working the kitchen but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It keeps prices reasonable and what they do make, they make it very well. I didn't get to try 30 restaurants in the area but I have to imagine this has to be one of the best ones.   I should also mention that the service and ambiance of the place were also excellent. Great place for a special occasion or a nice night out when you don't want to cook.",

My mom went to move it quickly, burning her hand. The server then had an amazing thought to send her less than stellar manager over who let the first thing out of her mouth be \"I didn't know the plate was for a child\" again common sense or even clear thought processing was lacking! Needless to say, our entire meal was comped (thank you) but not before I made sure to make the manager aware that she's very lucky it was my mother (sorry love ya mom) and not my 5 year old who burned her hand or it would've been MUCH more than a comped meal.",

Anyway, I went with the $17 macho salad...it was ok. Not really what I expected based on the description in the menu. My friend and I were hesitant when we saw black squishy bites, but I ventured, and turns out they were dates. Not bad, just unexpected.

Not only was our reservation pointless and a waste of my time, my prime rib... The meal I always look forward too, the one I hyped up so much, was COLD when I started eating it. My boyfriends was also cold. What a waste. The free desert they provides showed they didn't care, their offer to throw our meat back in the fire shows how they are ignorant that reheated steak is awful, their offer to send us home with new ones shows the clear fact they don't understand how they ruined our Valentines Day.  Seriously Bandrea, what the hell happened to you guys? Truly, no longer my favorite restaurant...",

I recommend the double \"duo\" dip appetizer which is delicious, but at $9.00 you cant help but notice how small it is.  My main course was the pork ribs special. These were incredibly delicious, but they were served with fries that are so thin you cannot grasp them with a fork and you cannot dip them in sauce with your fingers because they are so small they will get stuck in the sauce. Plus, this entree was $28, and struck me as more of a $17 at best entree. At $28, you truly are left feeling like you should have received more of something.  Trying to impress that special gal? This is the place to do it. This is a great first date restaurant, or a special occasion restaurant. But chances are I would never become a regular at this place due to their prices.",

We got our food incredibly quickly.  The server joked that the chefs weren't very busy, but hey, that's much better than the food taking a long time.  The food was all great.  Everything had a little bit of a kick to it, from the Dip Duo to the Carnitas Sandwich.  Nothing was outstanding, but it was definitely worth the money.  This seems like a great place for a date night or a calm night with friends. Check it out!",

The cocktail drinks were perfectly mixed and best of all, were strong (there's nothing I hate more than weak drinks!!!). We had the always tasty & fresh deviled eggs and it was great to see that they returned the Little House salad to an appetizer sized serving which is where it belongs. The staple of this place is the rotisserie chicken, and once again, it did not disappoint. The quality & quantity of the food negated the need for deserts. Although Bandera is not inexpensive, the freshness & quality of their offerings and the responsive, friendly service of the staff make it a worthwhile experience in Old Town Scottsdale. As I always say after ding at what I consider a 5-star place, we will be back!!",

With tip we couldn't get out of there for under $62. I think you're just paying for the location of the restaurant; a busy corner in Old Town Scottsdale. It was so dark I couldn't even see the food I was eating. I had to turn my flashlight on to see what was on my plate.  Two stars because the service was pretty good and the food was good but I would not go back there.",

Not much chatting or enthusiasm in regards to the menu.   I had heard amazing things about Bandera and we were so excited to try it because we LOVE Houston's -- unfortunately it wasn't as awesome and we thought it'd be.   Ambience and environment are nice. Good was ok but just not amazing - especially for the price. I was surprised how limited their menu was and just expected more options. I had to try the cornbread bc of the reviews but to me, it was a little dry and was good but not great. Guess I'm used to more buttery, southern home cooking type of cornbread. The steak was ok but Houston's is sooo much better bc of the marinade. My husband made the comment that the sauce on the ribs tasted like chick-fila sauce and it so did!!   Overall just wasn't too impressed, especially for the price. Glad we tried it but we'll stick to Houston's!",

The service was great. Attentive without being pesky . The drinks were very good . Husband had the prime rib and he loved it . Huge portions. I had the emerald kale and chicken salad . It was also very good . The artichokes were sublime . And the cornbread is a must have . We would surely recommend this establishment and return when in town next time .",

From the moment we received our Duo Dip appetizer our meals were terrible. The Duo Dip portions were barely enough for one person, let alone enough to share!   We ordered the rotisserie chicken like we always do.  Last night the chicken portions were so small we were wondering where they found such small pieces!   In addition to the small pieces, they did not even taste fresh.  They tasted more like old chicken  that had been reheated.  They have also started putting some kind of spicy pepper sauce on the chicken, which totally destroys the flavor!   Needless to say, we don't be going back to Bandera anytime soon!",

By all means you easily could of sat us on the other side that was empty-ish.

    "text": "Home of the flying chicken (aka delicious chicken to go that they bring out to your car)!   I have been a Bandera fan for as long as I can remember. Everything on their menu is tasty and high quality. Most frequently my family and I ordered to go; we ordered ribs, chicken, house salad with cornbread croutons, a burger, and fries with spicy mayo (don't forget the spicy mayo). Ordering to pick up could not be easier, you call and order and then they bring your food and bill out to your vehicle. Oh and let me tell you, every single time the order is correct!   Once we got our food home it was still warm and ready to eat. Oh my gosh, the ribs were absolutely incredible! The sauce and the temp that they cook them in are something special. The chicken was juicy and had wonderful flavor, and the burger was cooked perfectly. The house salad is a decent salad on its own, but when you add the dressing and cornbread croutons it is taken to another level; so yummy! The only thing that wasn't up to par were the fries; they were seasoned well, but were not fully cooked which was a disappointment.   If to go isn't your thing you are in luck, the restaurant itself is lovely. It is in the heart of old town and has a traditional and comfortable atmosphere. Just make sure to call for a reservation or get there early, because it is a popular place. The best thing about dining in is the way it smells...heavenly!   Bandera has incredible food, top notch service, and great ambiance. I'll be back again and again and again.",

    "text": "We used Yelp to find a place to eat in Old Town and of course it did not disappoint.  We arrived on a Thursday night around 7 and the place was slammed.  Since we did not have reservations the hostess said it would be a 25 minute wait.  I did find it odd that after telling us this, she selected \"25 minute wait\" on her ipad for our reservation.  I wonder if the software only called us after 25 minutes....  It didn't matter as we spend that time wandering around Old Town Scottsdale which was great.   The place reminds me of the \"Houston's\" chain with it's dark wood/steakhouse decor.  It's definitely pretty nice.    I'm not sure I would necessarily call the menu southwest since had cheeseburger, french dip, bangers & mash, and BBQ Salmon on the menu.  They also did not have a kids menu which didn't make our 7 year old too happy.    While outside you can see the chicken roasting on the rotisserie and it smelled awesome so I went with that.  My wife had the Kale Salad, and our kid the fried chicken sandwich (without the bread).  Overall the food was pretty good - the rotisserie chicken was juicy and flavorful.  Since our kid fell asleep we ended up eating her sandwich which was tasty. I was also a fan of the kale salad.  The menu is a little bit all over the place so I'm not sure I'd come here again, but it was a nice dinner in Old Town.",

Water came, no ice and chilled but not cold water... whatever... our waitress finally showed up again and took our orders. They were out of the first item ordered... right before food came they came and removed our appetizers, which were not finished and we weren't asked... we never saw our waitress again and had to flag her down to get our bill. Not sure where she kept disappearing to... This is the 2nd time in a row we had bad service, which we now have heard is their growing reputation. Too bad for them.

There was a nice, balanced mustard-honey sauce on the fall-off-the-bones ribs. They know how to do ribs. I wasn't expecting much from the \"vine ripe tomatoes,\" so their deliciousness, and the fresh cheese with them (I believe a soft mozzarella), was a bonus. I wasn't expecting the tastiest tomatoes I've had in a long time, and I make an effort to get good heirloom tomatoes. Portion size?: you better be hungry.  The cornbread appetizer is a 'personal size' that can be split by two. My wife spoke highly of the salmon. We split the two desserts and can recommend both the banana cream pie and the Oreo cookie ice cream sandwiches. Ambience is very nice! A good value for the price, which of course, is nice.

This place is no different-- same set-up, same great food.  The only difference is that this location is laidback. Whereas the Hillstone restaurants in L.A. required a lot of getting ready beforehand, Bandera in Scottsdale was still upscale, but with less high maintenace-looking people.    I had the prime rib and it was ah-mazing *cue angelic chorus*.  I tried both the creamy and fresh horseradish with it and prefer the fresh one. The mashed potatoes were also pretty bomb-a-licious.  I paired it with The Rule cab sauvignon.  I was so consumed into my food that I forgot to try my boyfriend's ribs dinner.  I did try the salad and it was also solid. We shared the Oreo cookies with ice cream for the dessert and enjoyed it.  Perfect meal.  We actually explored going to a more local joint prior to deciding upon Bandera. But because we were both craving meat and wanted something we knew we would enjoy, we went to Bandera.  And it did not disappoint.",

    "text": "My husband and I recently went to Bandera for the very first time, and I have to say we've never been treated so awful from a restaurant. We were greeted in the back lot by a woman who yelled to us if we were eating at the restaurant. I believe she yelled across the lot because she wanted to make sure we weren't just parking there. She then welcomed us and told us to go to the front to be seated. Waitress was pleasant, told us the specials, and we ordered. Here's where it goes down hill...Our bill came, my husband put his discover card in the tray, and it was picked up. Moments later a lady comes to our table sets the tray down and says they don't take discover, and walks away. Discover was our only form of pymt, so we flagged down our waitress. We told her we were just told the restaurant doesn't accept discover.  She confirmed and said we need to use another form of pymt. We explained Discover is our only form of pymt, we do not have another card or cash. People are now looking over at our table wondering what's going on....waitress said she'll get her mgr. Mgr comes to the table, repeats they don't take discover.  She asked for another form of pymt(don't you think we would of done this if we had it). My husband asked why there wasn't a post displaying the types of pymts accepted when entering the restaurant, and we didn't see anything on the menu. Mgr said she doesn't know why they don't list pymt info on the door or menu,  but did tell us that she gets a Discover card about once a month and people in Scottsdale usually have other forms of pymt or cash. Seriously, what was she implying. Mgr told us we could leave to get money and come back to pay(Don't you think we would of done that if that was an option). She then asked when could we pay, asked us our names,  if we had a business card to give her, etc. We felt like we were now getting interrogated (I get it, they want to get paid but now everyone around us watching and listening, it was embarrassing). We told her our names, we don't have business cards, and we would come back next weekend. She said ok, gave us our bill and her business card. Really, at this point what do you do?? My husband and I left. While in our car I remembered that I had my husband's $100 gift card he got back in December(we forgot about it since it had been a while), so we drove back to the restaurant. We knew it would pay the entire bill, but sadly the waitress wouldn't get a decent tip. I went back in the restaurant, found the mgr and told her I remembered we had a gift card and it should have $100 on it since we never used it. She processed the card, hands me another receipt and tells me we still owe $9.51 and to return to pay it(are you kidding me). I got back to my car and told my husband there wasn't $100 on the card and the mgr said we still owe $9.51 and we need to come back to pay. My husband said are you kidding me...lol. We never used the gift card, so i decided to call the 800 number. There was a pending charge from Bandera's for $100, so i called Bandera and told the mgr the bill should be paid plus a little for tip. Mgr told me they add 20% for tip and most gift cards will only process up to 80% of the card amount and I'll get refunded the difference when they batch out. Mgr should of told me full pymt may not go through, and we may still owe money depending on amount on card.  But NO she didn't, just tells me we still owe $9.51. Are you kidding Bandera!! It was not our fault your restaurant does not take Discover. Maybe your restaurant needs to display pymt methods on the door where customers enter. We have NEVER had an issue with using our Discover card!!! We made an effort to pay our bill, your restaurant inconvenienced us and were not apologetic either! The money was on the gift card, so it's not our problem your Mgr couldn't just run the card for the exact amount of $100. We had nothing less then an unpleasant experience and you made us feel like this was our fault. Really, we still owe $9.51. Send your Mgr to us to collect the $9.51 that your restaurant so dearly needs.  We have going to restaurants for over 20 years and have never been treated so poorly. Shame on you for the way you treat customers. This all could have been avoided if pymt methods were posted!! By the way I called your corporate office and I was told i should of asked what types of pymts are accepted before we ate at your restaurant, and that the owner thinks it tacky to display pymt methods on the doors of his establishments. The service just keeps getting better! Really, what's tacky is asking a customer to go through hoops to pay the bill due to the ignorance of the establishment not displaying pymt methods then assume customer should know. Then have the audacity to tell the customer they still owe $9.51 after all that happened. LOL, you've got to be kidding me!",

There are restaurants that boast about having the best of some sort of dish and this place has the best rotisserie chicken I have ever had.  Still have not had a dish here I disliked on the menu so that's saying a lot.   You may expect to have a wait for you snowbirds during those times of the year.  However, the wait is well worth it.  The staff if is on point all across the floor and some of the best I have seen!   5 stars to the staff and chefs that prepare some of the best home cooking plates in Scottsdale!  Also, hats off to the wait staff for providing exceptional service at all times.    Also, ask about dishes that you do not see one the menu ie, grilled artichokes!",

But overall the food is good, but don't expect a changing menu. Their focus is on a chicken they roast, and cornbread and mash potatoes. I would say the style is comfort food with culinary flare. Don't get me wrong the food is awesome. Although my boyfriend would disagree I LOVE their vegetable platter with fun, seemingly farm fresh vegetables charred to perfection. Their macaroni and cheese, appetizer of skillet cornbread and half-chicken come recommended.   Drinks are of higher price, but the atmosphere makes up for it. EXCELLENT service, definitely a highlight of the Bandera experience. This place is perfect for date night or when you're just looking for a yummy, solid dinner with fresh ingredients.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Bandera's star worthiness.  Ambiance is great, dark, romantic, great bar area..I could picture James Bond sipping on a cocktail at this bar and charming a Scottsdale woman back to his suite at the W before flying off to Casablanca to kill another villain..one star for that. That said, it gets packed, and can feel a bit claustrophobic.   Our server was wonderful. I think the True talent of a great server shows when they can handle big groups and are good with kids. I can't remember her name, but she deserves a shout out, star for that.    Now that I'm living with a famous health food chef/trainer I am lucky to experience what real quality food can taste like when prepared to perfection. Ill say the food was good, but not life changing here...so one star out of two for taste.   Why do they lose the other star you ask? Well it's always nice to have management stop by and ask how things are, it is an important part of customer service. We were celebrating a bday..and one of the attendees was in the two year old range. For the most part, behaving very well, but was occasionally letting out a giddy, happy scream, which can happen at this age especially with the excitement of helping open a few gifts for her mother.    There is the way right way to approach this situation as manager on duty, and a wrong way....The only time we saw management was when she approached the table and straight up told the group, \"If the child screams one more time you are going to have to leave this restaurant\"  This was after we had a half dozen appetizers on the table and waiting for our mains..Now I  certainly do not write books on the basic fundamentals of nonviolent communication, but I'm guessing this would not be in the manual.   Pissing off mamma bear is exactly the last thing you ever want to do.  A better approach may have been to start with  \"Hi guys, Im so happy everyone is having a lovely time at our establishment, happy bday, and I just would like to ask you guys to try and hold, insert name of said child here, happy screams down. The pitch is rather loud and echoing across the other tables thanks again.\"    It certainly soured the evening and I know that it may be a long time before anyone in our group gives this place any business again.",

First off there is no steroid use on anything they serve. So the leg and breast that I got were junior size. Delicious and juicy, but small. The two ribs were in a mustard sauce, but the meat was dry. Brussel sprouts were not all that. And I am a fan when they are done right. The banana cream pie was over the top delicious.

The place was crowded but we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks and just as fast we got a table. Great view of the restaurant. I went for the chicken and I was a bit surprised at how small it was but that did not matter, It was cooked perfect and full of flavor. This was a good choice. Good food, great service a must stop.",

Luckily Bandera is alive and kicking...this place was packed...hostess told us it would be a 30 minute wait for a table (Saturday Night)...we were able to snag a spot at the bar immediately.  We got lucky!  The food was fantastic...like always.  I don't think there is anything bad on this menu.  The Bartender talked us into the trout queso as an app...it was really good. The prime rib was so good (medium rare) and don't forget a side of mac and cheese.  I'm getting hungry again just typing this.   We did not have desert but I've had the key lime pie here in the past and it is fantastic.  It is not always on the menu...so call ahead.",

You instantly feel comfortable as the home cooked delicious aroma fills the air. Our DELIGHTFUL waitress Glorianna was the BEST. She was knowledgeable about everything and had wonderful recommendations for a first time customer. Just lovely and such a sweet doll! Although ALL the staff, including the hard working manager, all pitch in to help make the experience top of the line I suggest you request to be seated in Glorianna's section. THE FOOD! Beef ribs and the ever amazing rotisserie chicken were fabulous! So super Tender,  seasoned to perfection and soooooooooo juicy!  Oh, and the sides!  Everything is made with a dash of extra effort that makes the quality of your meal special.  5 stars in my book because it is so rare for a menu to be done to perfection and have a staff that works above and beyond as they exude the pride they have in their resturant!  Very impressive.  Xoxo ciao bellas!",

    "text": "Attended a birthday dinner last night for a friend at Bandera. Bandera is categorized on Yelp as a \"steakhouse.\" However, other than filet mignon, there is no steak on the menu. In fact, there are more fish entrees than anything else.  Admittedly, what they do, they do well. Unfortunately, what they do is very limited. Namely, a very small wine list and limited number of entree selections. Further, some of the menu items that were most in demand have been discontinued.  Ordered was: deviled eggs, the prime rib dinner with mashed potatoes, the rotisserie chicken with garlic mashed potatoes, the jalapeno cornbread and a white cake soaked in cream, topped with caramel sauce and fresh fruit . We didn't order wine because none of us saw a wine we recognized or liked. We ended up drinking beer (Fat Tire) and iced tea.  The meal was solid, but unspectacular. The five deviled eggs were good and remarkable only for the fact they appear on few other menus. The prime rib dinner ($31) was a smallish cut (approx 16 oz) for the money. The mashed potatoes (and the garlic mashed potatoes) were made from real potatoes and had chives incorporated. The rotisserie chicken dinners ordered were \"off the menu\" but the kitchen readily accommodated us. Where they were unable to accommodate us was with a former menu item, baby back ribs.  Bandera was famous for their baby back ribs. Enjoyed on previous occasions and commented favorably upon by other reviewers here, these should be a staple, like the hamburger at \"21.\" For a while, they were available \"off the menu.\" Alas, no more.  The highlight of the meal was the jalapeno cornbread. It comes in a small cast iron skillet. The crust is sweet and the interior is soft and crumbly. Combined with butter, it's by far the best item we sampled on the menu. To eat at Bandera and not order the the jalapeno cornbread is almost a wasted trip.  The white cake soaked in cream with caramel sauce and fresh fruit was excellent. Our \"Birthday Boy\" had to settle for a single candle in his dessert. The staff does not make a special to do over birthdays and anniversaries -- thank God.  The service was well above average. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Our meals arrived at the table hot and our glasses, especially the iced teas, did not remain empty for long.   I'd like to give Bandera 3.5 stars. They would otherwise be four stars except for the small size of their prime rib and the small size of their menu. Bandera is a \"safe\" choice in Old Town Scottsdale.",

It seems we were instantly profiled, as the hostess sat us at the worst possible table, in a mostly empty restaurant. Our table was right next to the dish station and we could hardly hear eachother over the constant clang of dishes. We asked our waitress to be moved to a less noisy table. She seemed really irritated and moved us to the table nearest the door, with the cold night breeze coming through the doors right at us. With the table change came a new server, she was really nice. We just couldn't get over their blatant desire to sit us at the absolute worst tables when every other table was open. We spent too much money and tipped too well to have been treated like that. We probably should've just left and spent our money elsewhere.",

But Bandera is just that good, from the upscale casual, relaxed and inviting atmosphere to the excellent service to the delicious food.  Ordering the cornbread to start is a must - it'd be a crime not to. The grilled artichoke and queso/guacamole apps are also wonderful. I had the macho salad, which was quite large and packed with good stuff. I also had a side of the mac and cheese that was outrageously good. Dessert offerings are limited to two choices, and neither blew me away, but the Oreo one was the better of the two.  Bandera is, like its sister restaurant Houstons, always a wonderful experience with reliably terrific food.",

Due to a malfunction with THEIR machine our credit cards were denied 5 times, each a different card. On the spot in the restaurant  I called AMX and was told the had NO record of our cards  ( my husband's and mine) even being attempted to be used. We had a huge credit line and no late charges. At home we called Chase and we're told that no attempt was made to use that card either.  The manager was arrogant and did not even listen when we told him what American Express told us.   AMX said it was an error with their server or their machine.  He was very rude and condescending. He insisted it was us. On a last attempt our card went through. No apology. No attempt to make it right. Not even a cup of coffee!  Went next door for ice cream and the card was fine!   A new manager  is desperately needed !",

The last time here was about a year ago and everything was delicious. However, last night we left so disappointed in our meals and the service.  First of all, the meals were at our table in minutes!  Kind of too soon, as we were enjoying the cornbread and conversing before eating. The Brussels sprouts were very undercooked - too hard to enjoy.  The ribs were dry and tough, and NOT falling off the bone like I had remembered. And the mashed potatoes tasted like they were instant.  We all remembered them being one of the highlights of our meals and last night they were the type you'd get at Denny's!  We asked one of the waiters if the restaurant changed management and he hesitatingly replied, \"I'm not sure....\"  My margarita was taken away before I was finished and I was never asked if I wanted another.  We definitely got the feeling that they just wanted to flip our table fast. Then when we asked for the remainders of our dinners to go, our waiter unceremoniously plopped three plastic containers down in the middle of our table.  No offer to help us wrap, no bag to carry them out, nothing. $30 plus a plate and we wrap our own leftovers? We finally asked for a bag and we got one.  All in all, this was a huge disappointment for us and I personally won't be going back at these prices.  Bandera, you've lost one of your biggest fans.",

Well how is that a problem you might ask since that is normal everywhere else...the problem is that they order their meal, are half-way through it and then move to their tables when called upon instead of finishing their meal at the bar. That's a problem because those of us waiting for tables can't get drinks at the bar since the bartenders ignore you unless you are seated at the bar. We waited nearly 45 minutes for a table standing around. The bartenders ignored you and it was impossible getting a drink.   The food was good but overrated. I ordered the por ribs and the meat fell off the bone. The fries were terrible and burnt little crisps..think of it like stale pringles... The service was polite and friendly yet not outstanding.  A good restaurant for the Phoenix area but a lot of hype. This restaurant caters to the 40-60 year old White local Scottsdale crowd. I definitely recommend arriving before 7 PM and after 9 PM on the weekends otherwise you will wait 45 minutes for a table standing around without a drink.",

    "text": "Extremely upsetting dinner. We had a pleasant start, drinks and appetizers were good, but when our meals arrived, our evening took a turn for the worse. Our friend took a bite of his steak and immediately started choking. A cook that was on duty escorted him to the restroom to make sure he was OK. Turns out he wasn't. He and his wife left immediately to the emergency room at Scottsdale Osborne Hospital while my husband, myself, our daughter and our friends' 3 children continued to stay and try and finish our cold dinners (not to worry the kids.) Needless to say, it was a rather unsettling dinner and we were eager to finish up and leave to check up on our friend. We never saw or heard from a manager???????we were stuck with a bill of food that was not eaten and completely un-enjoyable (the server said we took care of your friend's steak, ha!) and on top of it all there was no concern or sympathy towards our friend or our situation at all! Where was a manager during all of this?????? Our meal was fine. The tri-tip was dry and bland. Our experience at Bandera wasn't handled well and because of this we will never go back.",

    "text": "We heard great things about Bandera, and had to try it.  I have to say, the pork ribs outdid the chicken (although it was very tender and tasty).  Our source said the meat would fall off the bones, and it did!  You must order the cornbread, but expect it to be a little on the sweet side.  We loved all the sides, and the oreo ice cream sandwiches were fantastic.  We had a reservation, but did have to wait another 15 minutes, which was a bummer.  The staff was very professional and pleasant, and they accommodated our 11-month old with no hesitation.",

    "text": "This place is the best place I've eaten out of all the times I've visited the Phoenix area. My friends took me here when I was visiting last weekend and I really hope we go back next time I'm in town! The cornbread was amazingly delicious with the jalapenos inside and caramelized top. I split the chicken, green rice, and cucumber salad with one of my friends and the other ordered the ribs. Of course we all sampled each others meals. The ribs are without a doubt the best I've ever had and I would make that my standard order as the meat literally falls off the bone before you bite into it! The chicken was great, but not really covered in bbq sauce; it was moist and came off the bone easily. Rice was great and something I've never heard of before; I forget what was in it exactly, but I think it was cilantro or something similar. Cucumber salad was fantastic with it's cucumber, avocado, corn, greek olives, fresh feta cheese and peppers. I had a really great glass of Riesling from a German winery; wish I could remember which one it was, but it was very smooth. The waitstaff was fast and courteous. I love that there is a dress code for guys as it adds to the classiness of this place.",

    "text": "WOW!! This place is truly a gem in Old Town Scottsdale! From the outside coming in, all you can smell is the aroma of meats on the grill - so good! The wait staff is polite and quick to serve you. I ordered the cornbread and jumbo artochokes as appetizers while out with my aunt, and both were great! I am a cornbread fanatic, and this version was delicious! It was moist but not over buttery, and had mild jalepenos inside. The artichoke was well seasoned also. For my entree, I had california sea bass, which was prepared perfectly. My sides of red and yellow peppers were also perfectly prepared, although I didn't care for the tabbouli. My aunt ordered the prime rib, and wasn't fond of the spicing and thought the meat was quite tough. When she told the waitress, she immediately asked what else she would like, no questions or comments! She replaced that with the pork ribs, and OMG they were to die for!! Also, the corn on the cobb is killer. This place two thumbs up :)(:",
