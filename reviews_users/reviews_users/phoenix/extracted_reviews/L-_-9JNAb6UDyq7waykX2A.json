I ordered the Las Vegas Roll just to have something I KNEW I'd like and decided to try one of the Latin rolls. I got the Guamuchilito - Shrimp Tempura, Avocado, Cucumber, Crab Meat, Cream Cheese/Fresh Shrimp (breaded and deep fried). It was amazing. The decor was nice, not overdone. The service was good (read: helpful & friendly). We will definitely make that drive again. I can't wait to try some of their other creative rolls.",

I didn't read the reviews before I came here.. only after we were eating (which is rare).  I hate when somewhere good is down rated.  I read some of the low rating reviews as I was eating the awesome appetizer and wonder what exactly they expected.  I immediately grasped that this is a mexican-japanese fusion restaurant from the restaurant's name. I guess some reviewers didn't grasp that this isn't a typical sushi place;  it has a mixture of American, japanese sushi (not much raw at all), and mexican inspired sushi.  A lot of the sushi is deep fried (like the Las Vegas roll is at many sushi restaurants) and has ingredients not typical like CARNE ASADA.  Don't come here expecting raw sushi, wasabi, and sliced ginger... and you'll probably love it.  Also.. while it has a bar and even has a band some nights this isn't a night club (as some low star reviewers seemed to think).  Maybe the fact that this place has a bar and stage for a band has some people justifiably confused.. I don't know (the band wasn't there today).   In any case I'll be back.",

My husband and I went on a Saturday night and when we arrived the place was pretty full but we were seated immediately. I don't really like the table setup, they aren't that comfy & I felt like a sardine almost all crammed in there. I'm really confused as to why people are complaining about the prices, we've payed similar prices pretty much every place we've ever ordered sushi, traditional or not. Our bill was around $50 for 2 rolls & 3 drinks. Yes a little steep but well worth it in my opinion, and I'm almost sure this will be our new anniversary/special occasion go to (good bye red lobster) Some better drink specials on weekends would be nice. The food was excellent, seriously, like I want to go back right now. We got the culichi(sp?) & tres quesos. They have a live DJ And he played all Latin music. It was really loud and almost like a club but I enjoyed it and had no problem conversing with my husband. Our server wasn't like  THEE best, but he wasn't bad either so I can't complain about customer service. The hostess,who actual reseated us into a \"intimate\" booth did so very willingly after we placed our order and I felt 1,000 times better and probably enjoyed myself way more once we sat in that booth with some funky lighting fixture that cast a great orange glow.   **Bottom line.. Cheaper drinks on weekends and this place will get 5 stars from me. I definitely recommend and will definitely be returning.",

It was myself and 2 other individuals, we were seated almost immediately but then sat at our table for 20-30 minutes, without a single waitstaff coming to greet us, offer water and/or take our order. I kid you not, everyone within the restaurant were starring at us (minus the waitstaff, who couldn't try hard enough to ignore us) I'm not sure if it was because we were the only group of Caucasians or if their fully staffed waitstaff, and not that busy of a restaurant, just weren't equipped for 7pm on a Monday. We finally decided an entirely new restaurant to go to before anyone came to our table... Sooo all in all, if you aren't close to 44th Ave and Indian school don't waste your gas.. and even if you are, don't waste your time!",

From the looks of it they make their money from drinks/music nights and their food is just an added convenience to go with their alcohol. Food is overpriced and drinks get very watered down. Even though the staff is really nice they are not very knowledgeable when it comes to sushi. Obviously its not your average sushi restaurant and i know that but was expecting more. Three times I've come and i think im out.",

It was my first time at senor sushi and I had heard good things about the food but I didn't even get a chance to try it. We waited about 45 minutes for the food. My mom, who ordered at the same time as me, got her food and I never got mine. I waited patiently for about an hour but at that point I wasn't even hungry. I told the waitress I never received the food and that I wanted to cancel my order. Instead of apologizing she tried to blamed my other family members for eating the food even when they had also placed an order for that item. She made my cousin feel bad for eating the food saying it was mine and that he hadn't ordered even though he did. I know a lot of people like their food but I'll never know because I will not continue to give my money to people who don't care for their customers. I understand mistakes happen but once the mistake is made the professional thing is to fix it instead of blaming others.",

Spacious and somewhat noisy (thanks to the multiple flatscreen TVs showing soccer games), this restaurant was quite busy on the weeknight that John M. and I went - a good sign, I think. The decor itself reflects the establishment's main concept: Mexican and Japanese combined. We shared our orders, starting with an appetizer of   boneless wings with fires, which were OK but far too heavy considering what would come next. The rainbow roll was good, as was the Melina sushi. The sushi servings were very generous and not typical of the serving portions you get in standard Japanese sushi restaurants, and the prices were good. Service was efficient and very friendly. This is definitely a good place to try if you're in the Maryvale area.",

Really hard to keep up a conversation when you can't hear anyone... Also, the waitstaff although nice, they did lack on checking up on the table. This review is based on one visit to be fair.... I will definitely go back for the food... Although it was pricy it was very filling. Also, didn't love the location. Hard to find and lacked signs. Still giving them a 5 star for the unique variety of sushi:)",

    "text": "I heard about Senor Sushi through a friend, who was having a birthday dinner there. Imagine my surprise that in that same week, they were running a Groupon deal. When I first heard about where this place is located, I was initially hesitant, as I'm not a big fan of the West Side. (What can I say, Central Phoenix kind of girl!) Still, I gave it a try and I've been a fan ever since!  The inside is HUGE, I think at one point it may have been a sports bar of sorts. The decor is interesting, and it works. On Saturdays they play great music and there is a dance floor. During the week, I have not experienced DJed music. They also have a full bar and TVs that are usually playing soccer matches, football games, or whatever other sport is on at any given time. Any day of the week it seems like a pretty popular place and has been clean. There are always many diners, including large families, and an extensive amount of staff. The staff are extremely nice and accommodating. I have noticed that they continue to make improvements to the space and additions to their menu, so that's a good sign. On one particular visit there were musicians playing guitars from table to table and a lady was singing. Her voice is incredible!   The best things on their menu are, of course, the Latin Fusion rolls. Deep fried concoctions stuffed with different cheeses, avocados, etc? YES PLEASE! Upon first bite, I knew I was in love. These Latin Fusion rolls are ginormous. Prepare to stuff yourself into a happy oblivion. They also serve traditional rolls, but why order those when you can get those anywhere?  From the drink menu, they have outstanding Micheladas. For dessert? Fried ice cream, please! If you're into appetizers, I never order them anymore here because they rolls are just too filling, I recommend the stuffed jalapenos.   I've recommended this place to other people since I have discovered it and they've also loved it as well. Glad I gave it a chance! I don't know of any other Mexican Sushi place in the valley, nor have I ever had this type of cuisine anywhere else.",

We ordered quite a bit of food ($60 worth) and every single food item came out even more delicious than we expected it to be. The portion sizes were generous and in addition to being enjoyable, the food was really fresh. However, the service provided was pretty bad. Our waitress only came by maybe three times to check on us so we had to go quite a while without drinks and paying for our meal took way longer than it should have. I probably will go back because quite honestly the food can almost make up for the bad service but I really won't have Senor Sushi among my top choices for places to eat in the future.",

We went on a Sunday and when we got there, there was many people but we got seated on a timely manner. The real problem began when we ordered our food. It took an hour and a half for our food to get there. Our waitress never came once after she brought our drinks to ask how we were doing nor to ask if we we wanted a refill. After hour in a half! My sister called the waitress to ask where her food was at, since we all had gotten our food except for her. The waitress then said that they were backed up and left. Not once in that hour in a half did she ever mention that.  After another 15min she brought my sisters plate of food, which wasn't even what she had ordered! At this point we were all outraged and my sister asked to speak to the manager, which the waitress then said she was one of them. So then she asked to speak to the supervisor which the waitress then ignored the request and said that she wasn't going to charge my sisters food. Which is not the point, the point is that the service was HORRIBLE and no place makes you wait 1 hour and 40 min to get your food and not to even care to ask how you're doing or inform you that your food is not ready.  NEVER going back to this place again!",

The windows are blacked out, but there is a little sign if you look up and a solitary neon flashing \"Open\". It honestly looked like a certain kind of video store from the 80's and 90's. The kind of video store doesn't carry Disney movies, if you know what I mean.   Inside is no less confusing. To the right is a decent sized bar with a bunch of big screen tvs. Ahead is a stage.  Service was friendly, but it helps if you can speak Spanish. The menu had some of the traditional sushi rolls, but you don't come here for those, you come for the Mexican Roll or the Guanchito roll. Deep fried and heavy, but tasty and massive! The highly recommended jalapeno poppers did not disappoint.  Worth the visit, but probably wouldn't make a return trip.",

A word of caution: if you don't like deep-fried sushi, then avoid these rolls.  I LOVE the crunch texture and that's why they're my favorite.

    "text": "Senor sushi was an interesting experience. The atmosphere is kind of funny. It looks like it was a night club before. The windows are still blacked out and there is a giant wooden dance floor and huge bar. It was a little weird. It did not feel like a sushi place.  Anyways, I had a groupon so we decided to check it out for lunch.  We seated ourselves and the baby. FYI, they have good high chairs where my baby can't crawl out.  The menu had some fun things like edamame with tapatio. We decided to try 3 rolls- tres quesos, Milana, and guacamuchalito. We also got fried rice for Baby to chew on.  The rolls were pretty expensive. 11 dollars per about.  Wow these rolls were huge! We ordered waaaay too many. We can usually split 3 rolls between us but not here. We had so much left over. I would prefer them smaller and cheaper so I can keep up a variety. I love to get many different kinds of rolls and not just 1 or 2. Fortunately we had a groupon, so the price was not too bad.  The rolls were very tasty. I was a fan of the queso one, and hubby liked the guaca one. The problem was we only got friend cheesy rolls so it was a very heavy meal. I didnt leave the sushi place feeling like I got pretty healthy food like I usually did. I went home and took a nap and was still stuffed.   I did not find any problems with the service. It was fine for me.   Now the question will we be back? Hubby says he probably won't because he likes traditional healthy food. I would go back with a friend and another groupon but would order a lot differently.",

But trendy, with no real demographically defined  market. Not worth the expense. We shared 2 appetizers and one HUGE sushi roll. NO BEVERAGES and with a tip, just shy of $40! Great for large groups as the servings are huge. But it you just wanted to try a bit of several things, forget it. I see it as trendy, overpriced, limited market eatery with just OK food. Consumer ability to speak Spanish a plus. Oh, salsa and chips are not provided.",

We ordered the cordon bleu and caramelo roll, both were really good but they have plenty of cream cheese. The chicken fried rice was VERY good. We also ordered a miso soup as an appetizer but she didn't bring it out until we already had our rolls, when I mentioned that we didn't want it anymore she refused to take it back and gave us attitude even though she took forever.

Or if you do enjoy traditional, they got that too! My favorite dishes to start are the fire cracker jalapenos: crab meat stuffed in jalapenos. So tasty. Then I get down on the carne asada roll. It's a roll that's filled with carne asada and vegetables, rolled in rice, breaded, then deep fried. Try it first the way it comes, then try it with some if their signature Senor Sushi sauce. You have to ask for it. My go to drinks are the \"Mangonada Margarita\" for something cold and sweet or if I'm in a different mood I go with the \"Michelada\" which is your choice of beer mixed in with a spicy Clamato mixture they prepare and the drink comes with a chile salted rim. Great if you like cold drinks with a bite like I do.",

The place looks pretty to me honestly, I' am a person who prefers dark over bright light any day so perfect ambiance for me and he didn't seem to mind either. I went with the \"Mexican Roll (Call 911!)\" and he ordered hamburgers which kind of ticked me off because I wanted him to try something new but I got him to try a piece from my plate anyway. The wait time for the food was normal and once I tried it I instantly loved it. If you're the kind of person that LOVES spicy or hot foods I highly recommend getting the Mexican Roll. My fiance tried it too and loved it, and also loved his hamburger too. For dessert we ordered the fried ice cream, something we both never had before. I should've read the description on it though because its covered in coconut and I hate coconut but it didn't stop me from trying to eat it. The fried ice cream plate looked really pretty with strawberry slices placed perfectly around it with drizzles of strawberry syrup and hot fudge syrup, it was amazing. It all stayed under the groupon budget too (and yes we did tip). I highly recommend Senor Sushi!",

The latin rolls are by far the best I've had here in the valley and their calamari salad the first few times was excellent, but there's been quite a few problems I've encountered my last visits and I just keep giving this place more chances but last night was the end of  it!!! I had the cielo mar y tierra roll which is covered in panko and deep fried the chicken, beef tasted like it had been cooked days before not fresh at all, and the oil that the roll was fried in must have been old because it made the roll taste funny and this has not been the 1st time this happened to me here my buddy ordered the gordon blue and had the exact same problem and when I ordered the kamasaki roll and didnt like it because the rice tasted odd the waitress did not wanna fix it for me nor even bother getting a manager to check out the situation so I ended up paying for something I didnt eat she was rude about it too! The calamari salad was blah and there was only about 5 other seated tables in the restaurant and we waited forever for our food to arrive. Lastly we had the \"deep fried\" ice cream which was hard as a rock when it got to our table we had to sit around and wait for it to thaw out a little and I didnt even bother to point it out to the waitress she would have done nithing anyway, overall I have eliminated this restaurant from my faves list and would not go back by any means unless they'd step theyre game up and take food and customer service seriously what a shame because their latin roll menu has so much to offer and the cooks are just not putting any effort in what they do. I only gave it 2 stars because at one point they did serve outstanding food but the customer service has always been terrible",

I have been here on comedy night and old school night had a blast. I did not see any \"fried burrito rolls\" so not to sure what one commenter was talking about. The calamari salad was also pretty good! Some friends and I watched the game there and had some chicken wings they were surprise surprise great tasting also. They have a little bit of everything for everyone. If you want to try something new that isn't your typical sushi place, but a fusion of foods than this is one place you should try for yourself.",

There was a live DJ playing upbeat Spanish music. It was kind a cool vibe once you got used to it. Staff were courteous. Service is a bit slow, even with many staff standing around chatting. The waitress brought bowls of sauce but never told us what kind of sauce it was. she also didnt recommend any particular items to us. This is a fusion place, so wouldnt you want to push your unique dishes? The menu was a little small and had a lot of cooked rolls, but the food was very good. Actually it was better than good! I could see coming here with friends for an evening out. I saw some drinks pass by that looked delicious. We ordered a Las Vegas roll, a Shrimp Killer, and another spicy roll. Very yummy! Lots of good flavors. It would be nice if you got some soup, salad, or edamame with your order like most sushi places, but not a real big deal. I would just beware that waitstaff seem very inexperienced.",

    "text": "So I do have to kinda agree with some comments on here the food was pretty great and pretty fairly priced at around $6-$12 a roll depending on what you get.I went with some buddies that dont like sushi, but they had a chicken roll and a carne asada roll which was pretty inventive and good. They have a variety of food, which i liked. I went on a friday night had some good specials $2 domestics and I think $3 mix drinks not to sure though and it was pretty busy so service was a little lagging. The girls seemed overwhelmed, but the place is fairly new so I can understand some training needs to be done. It was a mix of a bar,night club,sushi place nice interior and decor. Ive also been at lunch time and the service was better. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is the service does get slow, but the food and music (which I might add they have a dj and a dance floor). I will continue to go, as service each time has been improving. Overall my service wasnt extremely bad, but it wasnt great either. Keep in mind though the weekend they treat it almost like a club, so it gets pretty hectic. Id say if you are going to just try the food go on a weekday or at lunch. If you want to have a pretty fun time, and dont mind some waiting than try a weekend. Either way its worth trying.",

    "text": "Since I don't live anywhere near this restaurant, it was a Groupon that tempted us to check it out. First, the location is in a shopping center in a run-down part of town. The restaurant itself was formerly a bar and still retains the trappings with a  big dance floor and disco ball. The sushi menu honestly didn't look that exceptional to me, but the reason I came was to try out the Latin-inspired rolls. First up, was the Firecracker Jalapeno appetizers, which had a slice of raw chile, tuna, crabmeat and cream cheese that lightly deep-fried and served with a nice dipping sauce. I found this to be less than \"firecracker\" status, but It was very tasty. Note the tuna tasted like canned tuna fish to me, not ahi, but all the flavors worked together. For the main dish, my sister and I ordered the Guamuchilito with shrimp, avocado, cucumber, crab and cream cheese. This was breaded and deep fried and while it certainly is not light fare, it's hot, crunchy and again, all the flavors blended well. The quantities are quite generous, too. My husband got the Cielo Mar Y Tierra, which is the same with the inclusion of chicken and beef. No complaints from him. My brother-in-law ordered the Mexican Roll because it was supposed to be spicy. He wasn't impressed, plus this roll is not deep fried and is served cold as a traditional roll. Granted, it doesn't say deep fried on the menu, but it's tucked in with the others, and it's an easy mistake when you're not paying attention when ordering. All told, we liked the fusion part of the menu, and I would recommend expanding that.",

The sushi rolls were not traditional but that's what made them interesting and they were delicious. The service was great too and our food came out with only a short wait. We ordered 2 different styles of rolls and a salad and we had quite a bit to take home because the portions are huge. The mangoneada was good as well. We went on Thursday night and waited less than 5 min for a table. If you're wanting traditional sushi this probably isn't the place for you but if you're looking for sushi with a delicious spin go check it out!!",

If you arent particularly fond of raw fish thry their carne asada roll which is cooked steak wrapped like a sushi roll.  The chicken cordon bleau is also amazing.   Not feeling any sushi-esk food, the fried rice and yakisoba noodles are on point.   They are generally pretty loud and their seems to be live music every eveneing. Fun spot with lots of energy.  I have to give special recognition to staff, i left my wallet there last time and they immediately stored it and i cane back and got it.",

I will say this first...this is not like a traditional sushi restaurant and they don't have any type of traditional sushi on the menu!! There's no hand rolls, no sashimi, no nigiri, none of that it's all MEXICAN rolls!!  I went over the weekend because I have had heard rave reviews that this restaurant was amazing and the food was great and unfortunately that was not the case.  When I arrived it was overly packed like a can of sardines and there was very limited seating. The wait was 25 minutes which didn't bother me too much because it was over the weekend and I expected the wait to be similar at any other restaurant over the weekend. When we got seated and saw the menus that's when everything took an unfortunate turn of events. The menu's were in very bad shape and ripped. Aside from the menu presentation there was not a lot of variety when it came to sushi. What was also off putting is the appetizers...there were Buffalo or BBQ wings and fries as an appetizer item on a \"mexican*japanese\" fusion menu which didn't add up.   We ordered our sushi (which came with no soy sauce, we had to ask our waitress) and the sushi was not good. I ordered the Kamikaze Roll but they put some type of Mexican house sauce all over it with a variety of peppers which ruined it for me. Back to the soy sauce...they didn't give me a bottle but instead a bowl of soy sauce with Tajin in it!!   I also ordered the Large Chicken Fried Rice which was actually the best item on the entire menu but it had green beans in it. My mango margarita was trash it was very watered down and disgusting. Overall I will not be returning ever again.",

It had spicy crab, salmon tempura, and the taste was pretty original, also had a slight spice to it.  The waitress told me that the Fire Cracker jalapenos were good so I went for those.  All I can say is I have never every considered jalapenos in sushi, but with the spicy ahi, and crab, these chefs really know what they are doing.  Really good!  I only had time to try 2 things because I had a meeting, but I'll be back again in 2 months, so I'll go back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I think its so cool that almost every sushi chef in either Scottsdale or Phoenix are Mexican.  I guess like my chef friend in New York said, Mexicans are really the best cooks in the world, but Sushi, who knew!",

I've had Mexican/Japanese fusion sushi in Tucson and loved it, but this place is far from any type of traditional sushi and not in a good way. First of all, we couldn't even find the place. We had a groupon so that's how I even heard about it in the first place. I called about 20 times and each time it went straight to a voicemail that hadn't been set up. The place has blacked out windows with NO SIGN, just a small flashing neon \"open\" sign. The atmosphere is weird. It's a very large open space with lots of black furniture and a dance floor? It looks either very unfinished or like a grimy sports bar, since it has huge tvs and a huge bar that covers one entire wall. I didn't find the wait staff too friendly, well trained, nor professional. It took over 45mins to get our three rolls. We had to ask for obvious things like dipping plates, soy sauce, etc. I agree with some of the other reviews that their orders are large and we had plenty leftovers. I also agree that the food here is extra unhealthy. Everything is either deep fried or overly covered in mayonnaise-based sauces. We ordered the tootsie, volcano and carne asada and the carne asada was the best, although it was deep-fried. I didn't feel like I had a healthy meal, good service nor a pleasant surrounding environment.   Also, I used their restroom and of the two stalls, one had the toilet seat broken and laying on the floor and the other had a door that didn't close properly. =/",

They stop serving food at 11pm was not really hungry but would have liked some menus just to try something. We sat down, we're not acknowledged until after 11pm so no menus. Actually I had to get up and ask one of the waitresses who would serve us some drinksand she said I dont know who has that table but I will serve you. She did seece us one roundbif beers and 30 mins later I had to get up and ask her for another round of beers so frustrating. Bi asked if she would bring us a drink menu she said they did not have one. When she went to go get our drinks I told my friend let's just go.   We had lots of beer money to spend and instead just ended up paying for one round. Oh forgot when we sat down the table was dirty and sticky, very irritating.   I went on the website to ask the owner via email what time they stopped serving food and did get a reply, he/she stated 11pm. Then I sent him another email lettiing he/she know about our experience and got no reply back.   Too bad for this bad experince will look for other restaurants with same concept and hopefully get better treatment!  Don't waste your time or money here!",

    "text": "So if you are looking for a authentic sushi experience, then I say, maybe this is not your place. I wouldnt order sashimi from this place, but I am really picky about that. This place has an awesome, lively, fun, truly different take ~ latin inspired sushi. So most of the rolls are deep fried, but it was delicious! The loud music, nightclub type atmosphere was a lot of fun. Here is my one complaint - MY GOD, it took FOREVER for the food to arrive. One of the folks in my party of 6 waited 45 minutes for ONE sushi roll. My husband waited 30++ minutes for his roll to arrive also. I think the annoying thing about that is to wait almost an hour for ONE sushi roll, have it happen to multiple parties at the table, none of the food arrived together, and for them to ADD 18% gratuity to service like that. Its presumptuous - why would I tip 18% for what I would consider poor service? None of us got to eat together, I ended up sharing my sushi rolls with the other folks at my table who were still waiting on their rolls 45 minutes later.   Here is a tip - order a salad or the teriyaki chicken, that came out the fastest or just dont go their hungry. It was definitely worth the experience.",

I love Japanese cuisine and I consider myself a connoisseur of sorts, that said the sushi is not \"bad\" a bit overpriced for the portions and the service was terrible. Granted I took my order to go, however while I was there I saw none of the tables waited on which were only 2 couples. After ordering my rolls which I was told would take 10 minutes to prepare, not bad usual wait time for a couple of rolls NEVER a hand roll though, I went outside to walk around came back in still not done. 30 minutes later finally done, but the waitress is now attending the new customers. So after 45 minutes of waiting I had 1 salmon roll and an eel roll. The salmon hand roll had almost no salmon on it at 7 dollars you would expect at least a mouthful. The eel roll was more avocado than anything and at 11 it was a rip off.     What irritated me the most was that what looked to be like the owner of the \"establishment\" was sitting there the whole time just ignoring the fact that I was still waiting for my order. Needless to say I will not be back. Go to Akai Hana on 23rd and Northern Authentic Japanese cuisine and sushi. They've never let me down.",

This place is somewhat a nightclub with bands at night so when u walk in, it looks like a dark night club with some tables in the middle of the dance floor. The had booths that lined the wall. The table we were sat at looked as if it had dried up soda or beer all over it and was pretty sticky. Yuck! The service was no bueno. We had to ask multiple times for water, silverware, napkins, and BBQ sauce. The server was sweet although she pulled out her cell phone twice and was looking through it and typing/texting while taking our order and while dropping off our drinks. Not very professional. They did not have a kid menu but I did notice they had one on their web page so if U have kids, u will need to look online because the server didn't know what they had for kids. No happy hour menu, although they have one. (Starts at 3pm) the margarita was pretty good. Stay away from the mango martini!!! Tasted like I was sipping on warm thick mango syrup. Ick!  The food was great. I would recommend the firecracker jalapenos and the milena roll, and the cordon bleu roll. Only thing I would have liked to add to my roll next time would be jalapenos. The flavors were good but needed a lil spice. The menu is awesome!! If they could hire attentive and experienced servers, this restaurant could be a gold mine. We will be back but will order to go.",

    "text": "Wow! So, these guys (owners) learned how to make sushi from another great sushi restaurant chain in Arizona.  They learned very well and after many years they got together and opened Senor Sushi.  The location might not be glamorous but the food is.  The taste of the food is excellent.  You might not find all of the traditional sushi dishes here but you will find great sushi.  For the most part the menu is a Mexican infused sushi and it is amazing.  Especially if you like spicy food.  The service staff is still learning and with time they should get it together.  Lunch time is the best time to eat here. They have a stage so it might turn into a Mexican fiesta a night with live entertainment.  If are looking for a nice traditional Asian sushi place this might not be the place for dinner.  There is nothing romantic about the restaurant.  The decor does have some Asian influence but the staff screams Mexican restaurant.  The staff overpower the decor, but the great tasting sushi overpowers everything.  I've never ate carne asada sushi (pretty sure thats not sushi) but they say it is.  Give it a try and tell me what you think?  I've heard its good.  Anyway  If you are in the neighborhood give them a try the food is worth it.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to purchase the Groupon for this place and give it a try. We are sushi lovers and have tried a bunch of different sushi restaurants. I have to sadly say this was the worst. I used to say that I wouldn't purchase sushi at a store, like Costco but now I have to say I would rather do that than have sushi at Senor Sushi.  First off, the service was not so good. There were people around us getting service left and right and it seemed like we were invisible. Frustrating to say the least.  The sushi itself was flavorless and old. I have to wonder how fresh that fish really was. Having grown up in the bay area and eating some of the best fish you can find anywhere, the fish at Senor Sushi tasted like it had sat there for 4 days before being served. The best part of the dinner was the desert which was actually good. Unfortunately we were both sick within a few minutes of leaving the place and tossed the leftovers out of fear of food poisoning. I'm not sure if this fusion is a good idea or if it was just not executed very well but sushi is surely not a strong point at this place. I might suggest the cooks head around town and try some sushi to get a taste for what it should be. It would also help to have fresh ingredients. You can't serve old sushi and pass it by anyone that knows sushi. Won't be going back to this place.",

They took our drinks and food order within minutes and in less than 15 minutes our food was served. The food was above average, pretty creative with the menu. It was a fusion of Mexican and Japanese sushi. Good taste on the food overall.   The restaurant was loud since they have live music. It's suitable for all ages I would say..",

One time that I came with my hubs we waited 10 mins..tonight we came and waited like 35 mins..so it's a hit or miss... It was super hot inside! Like I was sweating and it was just so clammy inside. I got upset because a waiter seated 2 woman before me and I was there before them so watch out with that. Now let's talk about the service. You will be seated and wait like 10 mins before your server comes and asks for drinks. So be prepared. Now the best part..the food. So far everything we have tried was amazing. The fried rice is so bomb! So flavorful and yummy. The guamachilito roll is bomb. The firecracker app is bomb. The poison ivy roll is bomb. Tonight we tried the bomba roll which was good. We tried the caramello roll which was bomb and this one that comes to you lit on fire which was bomb. There was a guy singing music tonight which was a nice touch. Slow service, but I wasn't mad about it and wasn't in a rush. I will come back and get something new. Check it out if you want a different taste on sushi as this place is a Mexican infused sushi that works.",

    "text": "Met a few friends here on Sunday afternoon and was unfortunately not super impressed. The menu is a good size, the selection of sushi is diverse and original, but the service and food quality are greatly lacking.   We had to wait for a few minutes as there were five of us and we were seated right at the front of the restaurant. This unfortunately caused us to be at the mercy of the brutal sun that came through the door every time it opened. Every time we looked up or turned around we were blinded. I think having a barrier between the door and the restaurant would help a lot with this. The inside of the restaurant was actually super cool with tons of red and black accents and televisions.  We ordered edamame and fried calamari as our appetizers. The fried calamari was a lot of breading and very little calamari. The calamari also came with onion rings, which were again more breading than anything else. The best parts of the fried calamari was actually the salad that was underneath it and the creamy mayo dip. We each ordered an individual roll and a order of shrimp fried rice to share. We decided to eat the rolls family style by passing them around--vegas roll, poison ivy roll, a couple of carne asada roll, and the minera roll. The rolls were definitely worth the $12 price as you got a good amount of food, but the quality just wasnt there. There was tons of breading, rice, and just lack of flavor and umph. The only spice came from the jalapeno cheese that was on the poison ivy roll.   The fried rice was such a disappointment as well as it was burnt--literally burnt. Everything from the shrimp, to the corn, green onions, and the rice itself was burnt looking and tasting. We brought this to the attention of the waitress and she quickly took it away and off of our bill.  Also, it took forever for us to get our food and it was not super busy. We were not really checked on during the process at all and then when we did get our food we were not checked on again. I think that if we were allowed to stay in the restaurant for the rest of the day we could have--we were virtually ignored.   There are so many other better sushi spots in Phoenix, so I do not plan to return.",

I now live out of state and flew back to visit family so I decided to give it a try. FOOD IS DELICIOUS, not really sushi since it has a hint of Mexican, it's more Mexican rolls than anything. However, service is HORRIBLE and DEFINITELY FAVORITED!! We were a party of 4, who arrived BEFORE another party of 4 (only difference is that the other party of 4, were young female adults dressed like they were headed to the club.) We were promptly greeted by a male server (Victor R.) but our drinks and food came out SEVERAL minutes AFTER the other party's!! I'm not talking like 15 minutes... I'm talking like 30 MINUTES!! How rude of you to bring out a meal to a person in our party and then take 30 MINUTES to bring out ours after!! Not only that, it took you another 20 MINUTES to get our desert!! And another 25 MINUTES to bring our check!! Definitely asking for a different server next time, maybe one who's not looking for a date while HE'S AT WORK!! How pathetic!!",

For these reasons, Senor Sushi is not a place that I frequent. Most of the rolls on the menu appear to be breaded, fried, and drenched in sauces.   If you are a fan of the fried rolls and prefer that to more traditional sushi, you will probably love this place. If you prefer traditional sushi, you will probably not care for it very much. Either way, it's worth a stop because this place is a Mexican-Japanese fusion and kind of unique in that aspect.   I would not recommend going late on the weekends because it's PACKED and the music is so loud you can barely hold a conversation without almost yelling.",

I didn't stay to try the food.  I will not stay at a place where the service is that horrible.",

It took about 2 mins for the server to come to our table to get out drink order, another 6 mins till we received the drinks. She looked a little busy. We decided to come here since we had a Groupon deal. Which included two Sake bombs, two salads or two soups, 2 sushi rolls any kind and a dessert. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and she checked on us many times to make sure everything was going well. The rolls were great and very big portions. The dessert was also a hit with us fried ice cream with fruit. While we were there they also had live entertainment of a mariachi band. This venue also is a club on certain nights with booths surrounding the restaurant area with a huge bar. The decor was ok, I would go back if I had a Groupon the prices are a little high without it.",

What we ordered:  2 Miso Soupos (Just as good as any other Miso we have had)  Mexican Roll- Very Good taste and presentation.   Yamas-Aki - Presentation was excellent, came out with flames, tastes great.  Culichi- Best Roll out of the three, Very unique roll, The flavors mixed well together  The service was excellent, our waitress was very attentive (Denise)   The environment was more adapted to the bar scene but the food far outmatches any bar food I have ever had.  They have live music as well, we will be visiting again soon.",

It was crowed (in a good way) so we asked to sit at the bar (even though we don't drink). Mary was nice and friendly,  even with the drink orders keeping her plenty busy. Totally worth it.",

The inside is huge with table and booth seating for at least 200. There is a fully stocked bar and even a band stand for live music events. Several TV's are located throughout with various sporting events on. Now on to the main event - FOOD.  We tried the Caramelo roll, the Melina roll and a Rainbow roll. All of them were really good! The Caramelo roll was our favorite overall. The fish on our Rainbow roll tasted very fresh. Service was the only issue. It wasn't busy yet it took a while before anyone came and took our drink and lunch order.  Overall it's definitely worth a try and we will return.",

I went today for lunch with my sister, who by the way hadn't been there ever.  We were greeted  and seated immediately as we walked in by a very friendly waitress.  My sister and I had the \"firecrackers jalapenos\" as appetizer and order the \"tres quesos\", \"rainbow roll\" and \"Culichi roll\" to share.  Let me tell you, all of them are to die for. Best part is that this rolls are huge and very affordable.  My sister wanted to order a fourth roll just cause she is so used to sushi at other places were they come very small and only six slices. But I warned her that this place is nothing but generous on their portions.  We were extremely satisfied with our food and service.   To be honest, it took me this long to go back just because last few times I'd been there before today, waitresses were not friendly and took for ever to get our drinks and food delivered.  But this time everything was perfect.  I don't give them a 5 stars just because I believe their rolls need to be a bit tighter since we had to rush picking up the pieces and eating them before they crumble. But other than that I totally recommend this place.  Just be warned, portions are BIG so if u don't eat to much just order one roll or order a couple to share. Also be adventurous and try some of the Latin Rolls. I assure you won't regret it!!  Can't wait to go back!!!",

Anyway, if you like sushi, it's a good place to go, but any other foods than that, forget it.  The shrimp and noodles dish tastes like they seasoned it with leftover ramen packets.",

    "text": "I will start off by saying the food here is good and tasty. Other than that, this place doesn't know what it wants to be. The dj is so unreasonably loud I had to shout just to talk to my gf who was sitting directly in front of me. Next, our waitress sat us at a booth where towards the end of our meal, they decide to drop a screen in front of us blocking us in at our booth! There were plenty of other booths and tables open. Why would you do this! Maybe if the food didn't take so long to come out to us we would have been out of there already. And we never got an apology. There were no Fucks given. Good food, terrible environment. If I wanted a nightclub I would have went to one. But what I got was an inconsiderate sushi restaurant with over bearing music. Way to ruin my meal! No wonder there were so many empty tables.",

    "text": "Bless Groupon for leading us to an unexpected find in Maryvale: Mexican sushi and a sizable, comfortable, and unusual venue to dine in.  Big comfortable booths line the perimeter, semi-encircling numerous tables stationed on the stained concrete floor.  The place is awash in a very oriental color scheme of deep red and black, while numerous flat screens broadcast futbol visible throughout.   Tucked away (I seem to go to a lot of places that are \"tucked away\") in a small 1/3 empty shopping plaza located on NW corner of 43rd Ave & W. Indian School, once you figure out it's in the plaza, the building housing Senor Sushi sit's behind/ just to the north of the O'Reilly Auto Parts that faces Indian School Road.  There's a lit sign on the building that apparently wasn't there early this year, and I'll grant that with the front windows and door covered up with only a lit \"Open\" sign exposed, it is a bit reminiscent of an old time \"adult\" bookstore - except I don't recall seeing any of them with their windows and doors covered with huge color photos of sushi rolls.   They were doing a surprising amount of business for a Monday night but it's a good sized place and they were not crowded and we were seated immediately.  Our server greeted us nearly immediately, was most helpful, and maintained a smile throughout our interactions.  She took our beverage order right away, and brought those to us in short order.  I regret not being able to compliment her by name, as she was friendly, courteous and helpful, and in English, which I don't think was necessary for most of the other patrons, but was appreciated by us.   We ordered a very un-Mex-un-Japanese appetizer of \"boneless terriyaki chicken wings served on a bed of fries\". The chicken bites were good, and the fries tasty enough, but it did make for a  heavy start.  Norm ordered the Rainbow Roll ($11.95) and I the Melina ($10.95),  consisting of Shrimp, Chicken, Bacon, Avocado, Crab Meat, cucumber, Chihuahuah and Cream Cheese (deep fried), Poor doggie, but very good, and huge.  I've never seen a serving of sushi of that size, and I thought the Melina was excellent, and loved the flavors.  The Rainbow roll of  Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Cucumber, Avocado, Spicy Senor Sauce & Orange Sauce, I thought very good as well, though didn't detect the orange or spicy which  I may have missed on the side.  We were unable to finish and had a small amount leftover to take home.    The full price of our generous meal for two without the coupon would have been $35 (+tip).  I don't do sushi often but recall spending way more in a very informal place in DC more than 15 years ago - and leaving hungry.  We did not leave Senor hungry tonight.   In other news, the stained concrete-floored dining area appeared clean.  The large, black-ceilinged interior  I thought had a night-clubbish feel to it.  Numerous families were dining and while I was surprised at the number of small children (burgers available on the menu if the kids aren't into rice & rolls, but not running loose and not obtrusive but for a shriek or two.  The men's room was clean and stocked with all necessities including TP, disposable seat covers, hand soap, paper towels, and working hand dryers.  If you're looking for \"genuine Japanese style sushi\" - go somewhere that claims to serve it.  In my limited sushi experience, you'll pay a lot more for a lot less.  \"Genuine\" is great, but don't let that stop you from appreciating a different take on the subject,   I think Norm R will agree our food was very good, the serving sizes downright shockingly generous, and our server could not have been friendlier or more helpful.  Your experience may vary, but as for me, I shall return.",

    "text": "My first experience in this place was a disaster, my two sisters, my older sisters boyfriend & I ; very specifically & nicely let our server know my younger sister was vegetarian. He showed us the vegetarian options.  Also, Keep in mind she's vegetarian for a reason due to being highly allergic to eggs. We each ordered different types of food & our server took about 10-15 minutes to bring our drinks. By the way the margaritas do not taste like they have any alcohol. Anyways, We didn't complain, still remaining very kind to our server. He brought out all of our food at different times , in between waiting about 10 minutes for each plate. We were all hungry & wanted to eat together so we waited for all of our food. But he had gave my vegetarian sister the wrong plate , we let him know & he took it and apologized for it. He then began to eat the plate that he had taken. We waited another 15 minutes, by now our food was very cold. He brought out the correct plate but had put chipotle on top of her vegetarian sushi. After five minutes of trying to get his attention, we let him know that we ordered a vegetarian fried sushi & the chipotle sauce had eggs. He began to try and argue with us about how the way they made the chipotle sauce did not have eggs. We asked if it had mayo and he said yes. We told him that mayo had eggs & my sister could have gotten very sick due to his mistake. He apologized and took the plate , by this time we were all very disappointed & aggravated. Our food was cold, we were hungry and we had like an 1 and 30 minutes waiting to eat. He came back with a regular sushi, it was not fried. But at least it didn't have the chipotle sauce. Haha ! We let him know about our cold food & he said theres nothing he could do about it. We asked for the check and left the place. Yes we paid for everything. If i could rate it negative 5 stars, i would. Never going back to this place ! Will never recommend...",

The food was simply amazing. We had Jalapeno Poppers (the best in town!) Guanchito Roll and a Las Vegas Roll. So amazing. This place is amazing. It is now my go to spot for tempura sushi rolls. Delicioso!  PS. The Pina Coladas are out of this world! I went from liking this restaurant to LOVING this restaurant. Five stars!",

When the waitress arrived, I had already ate half. So I was not going to tell her anymore,partial I was hungry and waited too long. Then I couldn't find her to ask for a refill,so I ended up eating my food with no more drink. Eventually she arrived again and I ask for the bill.

They offer a wide variety of traditional Hispanic dishes and secondary sushi rolls. On the back of their very colorful menu they blend sushi and Hispanic food into Latino rolls. If you are looking to try something different and don't want the same Hispanic or sushi restaurant this would be a good place for you. It was a clean comfortable setting and easy to find with good parking.  The rainbow roll I had was large, filling and fresh. $12.00 worth it",

    "text": "Oh, where to start...  Let's start with the food.  Ordered the jalapeno appetizer, Mexican Roll, Mohica (Momila??) Roll, and chicken tenders with fries (for the kiddo in our dinner party).  The jalapeno app was muy delicioso and not at all what I was expecting!  They were jalapenos sliced in half lengthwise, lightly and crispily breaded and stuffed with crab among other things.  The jalapenos were super fresh -- they appeared to be uncooked despite being breaded, which gave them a surprisingly good crunch!  The Mexican roll was my favorite roll -- it looked like your traditional sushi roll but with a latin interpretation.  It came with a dipping sauce that was difficult to figure out exactly what was in it... but I found myself soaking my roll in it!  And their special spicy sauce is outstanding.    The kitchen... was about as slow as they come.  After maybe 30 minutes, the chicken tenders came out.  It took another 25 minutes or so before the jalapeno app came out... and maybe 15 more minutes before the Mexican roll arrived.  And then maybe another 15 minutes before the Molica (Mimolca??) roll was delivered.  I am glad the children's dish came out first, but I would think both dinner dishes would have been served at the same time.  And seriously, it was a LONG wait time for food preparation.  The service was pretty friendly, but it took at least ten minutes before our server initially stopped by our table.  Granted, it was a super busy night... but there were a handful of times when I looked for a server but was left sitting there for five or ten minutes trying to catch her attention to ask for this or that.    The ambiance and setting... like other reviews state,  this place looks like more of a dance club with the lights on... so maybe trying to dim the lights wouldn't be a bad idea.  And the dark tint on the front glass is just tacky.  Maybe this is one of those places that turns into a club afterhours... so if that's the case, then maybe they could just pull off the tint by the front door so you it seems more inviting and open from the outside?  Not sure why the tint bothers me so much, but it does...  Next time I'd probably order carryout.",
