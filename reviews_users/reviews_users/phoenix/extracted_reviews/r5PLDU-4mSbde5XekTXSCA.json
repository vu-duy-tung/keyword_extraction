If you're opening up this app to figure out what you should order, listen up. The cheese steak or meatball sub are both divine, get it on the baguette. If you're leaning towards a cold sammie, the II purista is your move. Finally, the cheesecake (how am I not 500 pounds) it is the best cheesecake you will ever eat. Defalcos I love you, never change.",

The male employee behind the counter kept staring at me when I came in, as I ordered and when I sat down to eat.  He then pretended to clean a table near me only to use it as an excuse to come over and ask me if I had my cell phone on. He then said \"give it to me babe so I can add my digits to it\"  Not only offensive but over the top rude.  I got up and left. The owner needs to sit down with his under-trained staff and either fire them all or al least train them to be nice.  NEVER going back again.",

It is nice ,the food is good, but it is not great. The grocery food items for purchase have dust on them. I do not like that at all. It creeps me out a bit. Living in AZ ,I know Dust comes in from every direction. But, that is why you have to clean it.  It is a great location in Scottsdale. I do love their Mozzarella and the sauce they use for the restaurant meals.  However, I am just not blown away with everything else. It is good though. We are in the Desert and it is hard to find really good Italian here. Although Las Vegas seems to have it down. Maybe there are just not that many Italians here. So they do not need as much great stuff.  I do find Romanelli's to be much better. More Neighborhood like in it's feel. It is worth checking out though.You could definitely do worse.",

Crunchy outside crust, and soft hot on the inside.  Life changing.  The sandwich was big enough for two full grown men to share and came with au jus and marinara.    I also tried the Italian sub and the procciutto sandwich both were legit.  The shop has some yummy looking treats plus wine and beer.   If I lived near here I'd try everything on the menu.

Counter style ordering doesn't really bother me, and the guy taking my order was super cool. The behind him though, kind of a jerk and kept bitching about getting in late orders. It was close to closing probably 45 minutes out, I wasn't at the 30 minute mark so I think i was good. I walked in and then 20 others walked in behind me, obviously DeFalcos is no stranger to later diners.  Ordered chicken parm and mac and cheese. The chicken cutlet itself was absolutely nothing to call home about. It was pounded out, breaded and friend appropriately, nothing special at all. The pasta was way over cooked, and the red sauce, was watered down and lacked any depth or flavor. Ive cooked, and eaten both American Italian and traditional Italian my entire life and this sauce fell very short of what I expected. It wasn't like it was a quick crushed tomato, garlic, red pepper, onion, basil sauce that you through together on Tuesday. It was an I spent all day making this sauce, let me dump some water into it.   Mac and cheese, same deal. Noodles were overcooked, the mornay was a joke. Literally watered down and tasted like nothing. I tried to taste it, it literally tasted like nothing. I put some salt and pepper on it, it tasted like nothing and salt and pepper.   Finally the garlic bread. It was good, extremely reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread. Not being rude here it just was reminiscent of the frozen garlic bread. I regret having to write this, i thought everyone was spot on about this place but it was not good at all.  My $0.02.",

The store part of it had a good selection of deli meats and cheeses, as well as shelves of pastas and sauces.  I'm sure there were more things, but we were there for dinner, not shopping.  We ordered the large portions of Chicken Marsala and Stuffed Jumbo shells.  The marsala wine sauce was excellent, and the orders were very largely portioned.  The side salads were not the best, but the garlic bread made up for it.  The service we received was friendly.  It's probably not recommended to come here with a large group since seating is limited (It's more store than restaurant), unless you all sit outside.",

We arrived very early for lunch and were two of only a few others in the restaurant, but it took 25 minutes to get two sandwiches.  I am not exaggerating either.  We compared the time the food came to the time stamp on our receipt.  25 minutes.  The sub sandwich had a good flavor and lots of meat.  I liked the Italian dressing on it.  I also thought the ingredients tasted really fresh and stood out each on their own.  My husband said the flavor of the Italian beef with peppers and onions was quite flat. He said it didn't have a ton of flavor.  We also weren't too thrilled about the potato salad or the tortellini salad we got as sides either.

We have so many great memories there, however I don't like taking my kids there because of all the amazing stuff that is everywhere and I don't trust my little ones to keep their hands to themselves (I have little ones).   Besides that, I love their sandwiches, their pastas, and pretty much everything. I think I switch it up overtime I go there. Unlike my hubby that orders the same thing every time. I think he orders the Meatball sub every single time. It can be crazy busy and super chaotic - which is a bummer for people like me that can't make up there mind and it's kind of cluttered, so when I just want to browse I feel like i'm bumping into people. But that is what makes Defalco's Defalco's! The place is great. Check it out!",

Tomatoes, basil, evoo , fresh mozzarella, basil.  when I got my pizza, I got pizza sauce , 4 tomatoes, mozzarella cheese spread on the whole thing, and a few pieces of fresh mozzarella. The menu is deceiving,  looks like they pay attention to detail when it comes to ingredients, but it tasted sub par.  I don't think I need to visit this restaurant for a while .

The quality of their grocery items are unique and truly Italian.  I've spent some time over there, and this is the real deal.  You could have a field day in here if you wanted to cook a special dinner.  Yes, the wait was a bit for ordering at 2pm (it wasn't packed).  But the food...the food shut me up it was soo delicious.  The portions are enormous, so you get really good value for whatever you order.  One weird thing though: I clearly stated the YELP discount for 1 free cannolli, and the cashier looked at me like I was crazy and charged me for it.  The cannoli was probably the least satisfying part of the meal.  Other than that, I'd come back for sure.",

Their Fettuccine Alfredo is to die for. And, I disagree with a previous statement about the garlic bread. I always order extra to take home. The portions are huge, so order 1/2 order if you don't want to take any home. Their clam chowder is also very, very good. But isn't always available.   I have friends in Awatukee that drive into town on weekends specifically to eat here.   They have a great wine and beer selection, we always like to purchase 2 bottles of wine.  Drink 1 with dinner, and take the other 1 home.     Calling ahead of time is recommended, because as others have said, the wait can get pretty long due to overcrowding of the restaurant. But, if you are looking for a fun, friendly atmosphere, this is the place. They have magazines out front and newspapers, so it is fun to go and people watch while waiting for your food. And remember... the workers are True Italians, so sometimes you might catch an argument, or someone giving a customer grief. Its all part of the experience and fun.",

You can get some good beer here too, and every now and again I pick up a few groceries to take back home as well (pizza dough anyone?)   The biggest issue with Defalco's is consistency. On their very best day, this is EASILY a 5 star sandwich. However, they do have off days and happen to have them often. That's when you sink your teeth into a bready mess of a sandwich that leaves you feeling totally gypped. 3 stars for sure.  Mostly though, this place is quality and I would recommend it to anyone over the run of the mill \"fast food\" sandwich shops around town.",

I went for it but was on the fence for my pasta side dish.. he handed me a sample of the tortalini and I was in heaven.  Service was polite, the place was busy but not crowded, it was clean, and very appealing to look around while waiting for our order.  Took about 10 minutes to arrive, not bad.  I thought the price was fair  and i could have went with just a half sandwich as it was very filling.

However, in our second visit, they forgot to give us the napoleon dessert we ordered, which is $4.99 a piece before tax.  We found out that after 10 miles of driving.  Called the store to ask for credit.  Nothing has happened, kind of expected, even though whoever answered the phone said will credit it back to us.    So while you think about how good their food is ....  Make sure you check out your take out order to prevent any surprises that you might experience later ........  We weighted the two visits and give them 2 stars.  EDIT:  Anthony, the owner, was nice enough to get in contact with us and let us know of their policy.  DeFalco's has a policy where if something you ordered wasn't in your take out order they will automatically credit you back that purchase and give you that same item for free next time you visit; a credit one give one policy.

The fridge near the to go pick up counter also has raw pizza dough if you are wanting to stretch it and make your own at home (fun date night). Not a 5 because the pizza needs to be eaten fresh, otherwise it gets soggy and a bit rubbery.",

Then they tell you it's a solid 30 minute wait after ordering. Super rude service, terrible food, not worth it. Please do yourself and everyone else a favor and do not come here!!!!!!",

The gnocchi is so good, love the alfredo sauce, pizza is pretty great, but my favorite is the arancini. I'd never even knew it existed but now I'm hooked. If I suggested one thing from there it would be the arancini (beef or veggie) with a side of sausage. It's a meal by itself and the stuff that dreams are made of. Dont skimp on dessert either. Their cakes are to die for and they have this gelato ball in the case next to the register that comes in a crispy chocolate crust that is insane. I'd go for the raspberry or espresso, but that's ur call. Just dont miss it.",

But don't worry they will up charge you for the changes and then add insult to injury and f@$# it up. Just thought newbies should be aware.

I tried to give this place a second shot, thinking maybe it was  just the pepperoni. Nope! This pizza was worse. Got 2- 12 inch pizzas. One had sausage and bell pepper, the other was ham and heavy mushroom. Both sucked. I am being honest. So greasy yet dry. Both pizzas had no flavor! Still looking for the heavy double mushroom. Almost non existent on pizza. Yet was charged for the toppings. Not to mention girl at register had a real bad attitude. Dear owner, please hire staff that actually have customer service. My advice to cashier,if your not happy, find another job. I feel like I deserve a dam refund! Disgusting and 29. 69 less in my pocket for attitude and food that sucked!",

For both of us, the sauce was so salty you could barely eat it. In fact, we have over half of it left. My friends cheese lasagna had a big piece of meatball in it. The garlic bread had so many herbs on it, it was green. The parmesan cheese on it was overdone as well. The cheesecake order was messed up. I ordered Chocolate Caramel and Strawberry, but got Strawberry and plain, even though the container said what I ordered on it. I called and told the manager I was unhappy with the meal and his reply was it's the same recipe and he would check on it, but didn't have any other complaints. It might be the same recipe, it doesn't mean it didn't get messed up. I love salt, so if I say it is over salted, it was. Coming from 40 years of food service, the thing to do would have been to offer a replacement meal, but.....doubt if I go back unless they resolve this.",

Unfortunately it only earns a solid \"mehh.\"  The sandwich bread is delicious (both the Italian sub and baguette). Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.

I also ordered a bruschetta sandwich (only supposed to have cheese, tomato & basil), but it tasted like some kind of deli meat..... weird.....

Laziness and corporate making sauce like its coming out of the jar is never a good thing. The prosciutto is never moist and that's a problem as well.

I gave Defalco's four stars and it was as hard as pulling an in-grown toenail. I do really enjoy this place, but there are some things you can't overlook. They have great foods and a wide selection of groceries to choose from, but it's quite small. Everyone is in love with this place so there are limited number of seats to choose from.   And the line situation is never clear. It's like Southwest Airlines where they have you line up according to your zone and seats, but people think because they are B13, that entitles them to run roughshoud over B14 and be rude. To avoid this - go at a non-busy time, but I am not sure when that is. Trial and error.  I recommend going here. It's finger licking good. I am not an Italian, so I can't speak for their cuisine, but I think it would make them proud.",

Side salad was really nice and included more variety of veggies than I typically get with a side salad. Wished the baklava had more layers of phyllo but good flavor. Cannoli was also good. We didn't order pizza but the pizzas they were bringing out for other people looked really good.",

The cheesesteak was the best I've ever had! And my hubs sandwich was super fresh and delicious!   If you have time to wait and savor the deliciousness of their sandwiches, go!",

The sandwich however was disappointing.  Whoever sliced the meats left the casing on.  Whenever you bit into the meat you had this stringy casing you had to remove from your mouth.  I brought it to one of the cashiers attention and they didn't seem to care.  I still love this place but it must instill better quality control in their workers.  I just hope this is a one off because if it is not the restaurant is doomed.",

I've only had a couple of their sandwiches and one of their salads. The sandwiches I've tried are the cheesesteak- bomb; the meatball - bomb; and the chicken parm - meh. I've tried their Chicken Spinach salad which was pretty good and filling. For dessert, try the Tiramisu which is pretty good - unfortunately, ours was still frozen but a couple minutes exposed was enough to be edible. Aside from the restaurant, Defalco's is also a mini Italian market where you can buy wines, bread and other Italian stuff. Be prepared to wait in line and for a table as it is a pretty small joint. All in all, this is a good place to go when you need a good sandwich.",

However, the sauce was over-cooked, almost to the point of having a scorched-like flavor - perhaps masked with sugar since it was overly sweet, as well.  The lasagna itself was decent.  The meatballs were bland with a mushy texture.  Perhaps, since we are from Cleveland - home to some of the finest Italian restaurants in North America -, and because my husband has labored for years to perfect his family's spaghetti sauce, we're too finicky.  If so, I apologize.",

They acknowledged me, but couldn't send anyone to help me.   I ordered a whole cheese steak and a whole meatball sub expecting two giant sandwiches but seemed to get 2 separate half sandwiches each at around 4 inches long. You could tell they made them separately since the meat tapered at both ends of each piece.   I was seriously disappointed at the size of these sandwiches for the price. I can't imagine spending $5 for one of these half sandwiches. They weren't even that stuffed full and the baguette wasn't very crisp, bordering on slightly stale. The take out box they gave me looked almost half empty with the sandwiches in there too.  The flavor of the meat  wasn't too bad though. The mushrooms were nice and the cheese sauce was really good too. It actually reminded me a lot of  the Uncle Sam's that used to be by my house. Better quality here, but I feel like I enjoyed the Uncle Sam's cheese steak more.  The meatball sub wasn't anything special to me either.  Not sure I'd ever really come back.",

Seriously, even the greatest carnivores among us (like me) that normally scoff at a vegetarian entree will buckle for the the mighty Defalco's mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar on sub roll.   The service is friendly but the shop can get extremely crowded during peak feeding frenzies. Try to go early or slightly late if possible, you won't be disappointed.",

Did apologize, but the person that followed him out was obviously upset with a customer and stated so, loudly.  We've been there quite a few time, but to be honest, there are other delis just as good with service and employees who appreciate you coming in .",

    "text": "Sooooo happy to have found this gem!!! Authentic Italian food with a first class deli. Everything is extremely fresh and delicious! We stopped in for a pizza one night. We had the PIZZA BIANCA with pepperoni and mushrooms. Literally my taste buds exploded with goodness!!! I highly recommend that particular combo and pretty much anything on the menu. We came back a couple of days later and got a variety of fresh lunch meat and cheeses. All of which we are still enjoying. They unfortunately were out of canolis, however we tried the NAPOLEON which, no surprise, was delicious!!! We got a loaf of the fresh bread to go with our deli meat that still tastes as good as it did 3 days ago when we bought it, as well as the texture has not hardened. Absolutely worth 5 stars. Service: excellent. Food quality: excellent. You feel like you're being cooked a quality home cooked Italian meal and the owners are there to personally assure that you are being taken care of and that it is up to the highest standards. Go try Defalco's!!",

He didn't really offer anything and his answer was a little rude - my friend said it was really rude.  I ended up having the sandwich combo and my friend had the meatball sandwich, neither was remarkable nor noteworthy, they were just average. So not sure what the big deal with this place is? I have to wait and watch triple d to see if they recommend something better.",

I was a little confused about how the ordering process worked because it isn't a restaurant-restaurant where you sit and order which is what I expected, but just hop in line, the menu is hanging above the deli counters. Speaking of the deli counters... Yum! The sausage and salami looks so good I wish I had bought some, maybe I will before I return to Vegas. The desserts are also gorgeous and delicious looking, I ended up getting the chocolate covered cannoli which was fantastic-the filling especially!   My fiance ordered the meat lasagna which was tasty and I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich that was so perfect! The mushroom is marinated and has a real sharp bite to it and then you get the delicious goat cheese with it which just kills it.  We came because of triple d, and after our huge let down earlier that morning this place just shined even more!",

    "text": "I am sitting here as I type this.  My wife, her parents and I were visiting from out of town and decided to drop by an \"Italian deli\" for lunch.  Firstly this place is closer to a deli you'd find on New York rather than one in Italy.  In line, I heard two people order fettuccine Alfredo for lunch...   So, here's our order:  one prosciutto sandwich (one if the few Italian items on the menu),  one Italian sausage sandwich, one portobello sandwich and one cheese panini.  While I was ordering,  the cashier ( the owner) kept giving me an odd look...like \"who do you think you ordering here?\"  I also got a beer which was on display.  When I asked for it,  he didn't know what it was so I had to show him the bottle.  Also, the request to have a double espresso and tea made later seemed to give him and an associate all kinds of inconvenience.    Here's what we got: The prosciutto sandwich was good albeit a bit greasy. The Italian sausage sandwich was OK. The portobello sandwich NEVER arrived.  Instead we got another half of a sausage sandwich.  When I told this to the server, he said \"If you want portobello I'll make you one.\"  No apologies no cares.   When it finally came out, it was bad. The cheese panini (which had bacon in it!) was nasty.  When I went to ask for a knife,  the owner said that they should be out by the soda machine.  I informed him they were not.  He screamed for 'Ernesto to bring out the knives\" and told me \"the should be out soon, I THINK\".  Also got first apology of the day.  The espresso was atrocious.  It's beyond words how bad it is.   Really awful. Seriously.  Finally,  to add injury to insult, we were overcharged 50c .  This was explained as a computer error.  We got the money back.  Will NEVER return.",

Defalco's is the kind of place I really miss from the Boston area.  Down to earth guys, a variety of good Italian deli meats, salads, cheeses, a nice selection of Italian grocery items, and great sandwiches.

    "text": "Wow!! This place is seriously a gem. Our family has been coming here for several years now and we've decided that this is the closest you can get to an authentic Italian deli in the East Valley.   My recommendation is the \"Il Purista\" sandwich--a basic Italian sub with prosciutto, basil, tomato, fresh mozzarella, etc. This sandwich is a game changer. The price is extremely fair and the size of the sandwich is perfect for leftovers.   Service is good and they always have call in orders done on time.   Seriously-don't miss this place.",

    "text": "You want authentic Italian in AZ you go to Defalco's!  When you walk in you get hit with the authentic Italian smells of Italy.  Their dishes are a mix of the old school and new school Italian and you can tell their recipes have been handed down for generations.  Their staff is super friendly and treat you like family.  Defalco' was also on the Food Network's DDD, so you know they are throwing out some amazing food!  The food is Phenomenal.  You really cannot go wrong with anything on their menu especially if it has their in house made sausage.  Here is what I recommend when you go to Defalco's:  Meatball Hot Sandwich: Comes with House made Meatball, with melted cheese on a sub roll.  You get the soft chewiness of the sub roll then there house made marinara sauce with the perfectly cooked, tender, juicy meatball, then the nice creaminess melted cheese.  Best Meatball Sandwich I have ever had.  Italian Sausage with Peppers and Onions: Made with in house made sausage, red and green bell peppers, onions, and melted cheese on a sub roll.  Another awesome sandwich that was on DDD (Diners, Drivins, and Dives).  Off the first bite you again you get the soft chewiness of the sub roll then the snap of the sausage casein loaded with spices, then the hit of the sauteed peppers and onions, then on the back end you get the amazing flavor of the house made tomato sauce and melted cheese.  Straight on mouth punch to the taste buds!  My Favorite Sandwich Chicken Parmigiana: Made Lightly fried and breaded chicken with melted mozzarella & topped with out home-made sauce on a sub roll.  Best sandwich on the menu!  Once again right off the bat you get the soft chewiness of the sub roll then you get the nice tender, juicy white meat chicken with the light crunch from the breaded crust of the chicken.  Once you get past that awesomeness you then get hit with the amazing home made tomato sauce and the melted mozz!  I am telling you its a must have!  If you are going to get an amazing pizza you have to go with the  Chicken Pesto Pizza: The Pizza is Grilled Chicken, Pesto Sauce, Cheese, Fresh Tomato, then I added sausage, and ricotta cheese.  The pizza crust is perfectly cooked.  Not to crunchy, but soft, chewy, pull apart greatness.  Your first bite you get that delicious crust, hit with the amazing pesto and fresh tomato, next the juicy tenderness of the chicken and the spices of the sausage, then you get the nice creaminess of the ricotta cheese on the back end.  There is a lot going on but you have multiple amazing flavor layers that your brain will thank you for!  You are looking for the most authentic Italian in AZ and be treated like an Italian family?  Go to Defalco's!  Welcome to the Family!  BrandonFitFoodie",

After a couple of hit and misses on our meals in Scottsdale while here on a business trip we decided to take the advice of the manager at Old Town Cruisers where we went to rent bikes. And that was...come to DeFalco's Deli. The huge Capacollo, Hard Salami & Provolone sandwiches on fresh Focaccia Bread we had for lunch were probably the best sandwiches we have ever had. Sadly we could eat only half because we were already enjoying our beautiful cappuccinos made by Antonio. The freshness of the food, the outstanding service and incredibly reasonable prices made this place the highpoint of our few days stay in Scottsdale. In fact we loved the joint so much we came back later that evening for dinner. We shared the best 10 inch Calzone ( Centurian ) money can buy...my God it was good ! My wife being a very versatile cook has made calzones and makes them very well but not as good as these guys. And then we shared a giant slice of New York Cheesecake which was no doubt the tastiest Cheesecake we have ever had. We even took a tub of their imported gelato back to the hotel. It was a very unique flavor and I thought it was great. If we had known from day one how good this deli was we would have eaten here every day. As it is this is the only place we have dined at twice in the same day. This place is the best !",

We were absolutely impressed with the atmosphere and the food. We all rolled ourselves out of the building with to-go boxes.   My second experience was definitely the opposite of our first. I took my fiance as a surprise for his birthday. When we arrived, the employee took our order, which we had to repeat a few times. We ordered my cheese lasagne and cappucino, my fiance's italian sandwich with olives and coors bottle and a cookie. We asked that the cookie and drinks be brought out.   We sat down and waited. The food always takes a while to come out, which is fine. The atmosphere is incredible, everyone is so relaxed. After about a half hour, our food came out - still no drinks. Our food came out and my fiance's food was missing his olives. So our drinks were still missing and his food was wrong, as well as our dessert.   My fiance went up to talk to the employees and came back extremely upset. He had asked about my drink, and our cookie and had been blown off by the employees multiple times, including one of them asking the other if I wanted a hot or iced cappuccino and the initial employee responding 'whatever man, just make it hot.' That lack of customer service, infuriated my fiance. Eventually the drinks showed up at our table. Still no cookie I had ordered. About ten minutes later, the initial employee that had taken our order showed up and delivered our cookie to the family at the table next to us, with two adorable children who were delighted by the surprise. They said 'oh thank you so much what a surprise.' I tried to flag him down, he ignored me and walked away.   After we finished our dinner, I walked up and asked the same employee if I could then have the cookie ordered - he looked confused, shrugged and asked another employee to help me. The only kind employee to help us the entire night, was then this employee, who seemed to pick up on the crappy attitude and service most of his team was giving to the remaining guests. He was wonderful, just kind, with a smile, offered me my cookie (I LOVE me some italian cookies) and even two because it was so late in the day, but I really don't need that much sugar - going to a late night concert.   We then had our cookie with the remainder of my cappuccino - gave our dishes to the very sweet busser, who also had a great attitude (the only two in the building) and left.   I am so extremely disappointed because after living in Italy for a year, it is rare to find such a fun establishment with a store, and great food with a lovely atmosphere. After such crappy service and treatment of my fiance, who was trying to correct my order, we will likely not return.",

Comes with a wonderful side salad and garlic bread. These people are not stingy with anything (doesn't seem to be any corporate scales weighing anything in the kitchen). Just good old fashioned judging on the side of generous. The nice guy at the table next to us shared his cannoli with us...oh my God, it was really really good. No wierd overly sugary fluff on the inside, but some sort of creamy flavorful mascarpone/ricotta(?) slightly sweetened..with a crunchy flavorful shell.....who knew a cannoli could be so good. Going back soon to work around the menu. Considered not putting this on Yelp so you won't be standing in front of me in line...but they deserve a great review, and I would stand in line for this food. Yum.",

So I took a guess at which one since it was under that label..I ended up with tortellino salad (or however you spell it)  instead of what I wanted. But is it my fault it's on the wrong label..she wouldn't even take 3 steps over so I can point to which one. Common sense that if a customer continually points to what's in the fridge and says I don't know the name (because I was quite sure the label wasn't correct), why don't you as an employee take 3 steps over so we can both make sure we are correct. Don't just ask me what it says..because I was hesitant as fuck because I didn't think it was correct since the fridge looked a mess, either way i said the label it was under.   Also add more milk substitutes..first of all milk from a cow is disgusting and gross and filled with hormones, so no one wants to drink that.  Add almond milk, soy milk, or coconut.",

    "text": "This place has a very nice inviting atmosphere and feels really mom-and-pop.  They also have a few racks of groceries that you can look through and purchase from.  One of these days I will buy cannoli shells and make my own cannolis!  In the meantime, I think I'll just order their food.  This particular time I had the bruschetta sandwich, which once I saw it I kind of had to laugh at myself for ordering it.  Bruschetta is kind of just like an open face sandwich, so to make it a sandwich you just have to close the breads over one other and boom sandwich.  And that's pretty much what mine looked like.  Honestly, I was a slightly disappointed by how mine looked especially next to my dad's chicken parm., sandwich that was jam packed.  However, I will say, my sandwich was pretty darn good and was very favorable and even though I probably won't order it the next time I visit, it won't be because it didn't taste good, because it tasted very good.  Rather I will get something else because it all sounds so good!",

It took us 30 minutes to get our food (1 pizza and 2 pastas), and when it came out all 3 entrees were lukewarm, like they had been sitting there for a while. The gnocchi was over-cooked and mushy and the pizza was soggy. The atmosphere is cute and warm, and you get a lot of food for the money. But it doesn't make up for the cold food and slow service. Not very impressed with the place and likely won't be back.",

They do sell beer and wine by the glass/bottle, and they have a great deli selection of meats and cheeses. Skip the line by ordering in advance to go.",

Other times I have been here are shorter, but still longer than other places. I've had the centurion calzone and meat lasagna and they are delicious. The calzone's bread has a just baked feel and the mozzarella cheese is amazing. A ton of flavor is packed into the calzone. Really you can't go wrong with this choice. I enjoyed the lasagna and it tastes like you would expect it to. One of the better lasagnas that I've had. I also tried the tiramisu and it was rich but not overwhelming. Very airy and chocolatey!",

And if it's good enough for Guy Fieri it's perfect for me! It's such a cute little grocery store with all of these treats and ingredients straight from Italy. There's so many types of pasta and wine to choose from it's almost overwhelming but in such a good way.  I've had just about everything on their menu and everything is always so perfect. So flavorful and mouth watering.  The subs, the pastas, the pizza and the sides everything is wonderful and so well made. Plus it's family owned so you know it's made with love.  Their dessert selection has a few different options everyday but the baklava is always my go-to it's so good not overly sweet, perfect combination of flaky from the pasty and sticky from the honey it's fantastic.  If you live in Arizona and have never been here you MUST try it!",

The tables are set up within the pockets of areas that they fit, next to the shelves of food, by the door, next to the kitchen , etc its really homey and a neat idea.   You go up to the deli counter and order. The deli counter has a huge variety of salads and sides within out for customers to see, which all look amazing by the way.   I tried the meatball sandwhich, tomato and mozzarella salad and Greek salad. All amazing!! The bread used for the meatball sandwich was crispy but soft on the inside. Meatballs were a generous size and full of flavor. Loved the tomato and mozzarella salad with basil and a balsamic vinegarette dressing.  Craving that again!!  Super cute spot, check it out if your in the mood for Italian yummy!",

They have a full service deli & grocery, so you can take & make your own Italian creations if you want. I got sausages one night & it even made my cooking taste good! The prices are amazing too. For about a quarter more than you'd spend on your \"five dollar footlong\" you can get the real deal. If you want food in a super hurry, go somewhere else. They make everything after you order, so you might hafta wait, but the seating is set up well. You can still feel tucked away & watch TV until they bring your food over. I turned some friends from Connecticut onto it & also some other New Yorkers....now get your butt over there & eat some real food!   :)    PS, their chocolate (mousse type) cake will change your life!",

They do some times take a long time to fulfill your order though.   I have only had the subs there, can't say a deli is the place for pizza. Had some of their cappuccino  and  I can say their food is good but not great or anything to really rave about. Actually I found their cold subs are better than the hot ones. The hot ones are rather bland to my taste and really lacks anything special especially the bread and I have tried 4 different types, there is little seasoning. The subs ingredients are plentiful, they do put a lot of quality ingredients and yes they are better than the chains so they may be a couple of dollars more, it is worth it. It really is good or a little better than average and I do not consider the chains average. All in all, I would recommend it for their quality and also they have a good  plentiful selections. Does not blow me away and I usually like it here for the atmosphere also, so the two combine is not bad.",

Homemade tomato sauce, pasta, pizza- you name it. Even the owners are homemade Italians, if you know what I mean. You can also purchase Italian-style groceries (pasta, sauce, wine) so you can take home to cook and pretend you are a cool Italian.

    "text": "I've been here a few times and always been so impressed but keep forgetting to make a review. I feel like I say this in all my reviews lately but I'm pregnant and so really when I'm craving something, it's so specific and I end up building it up to be the best thing in the whole world and then when I get it I'm disappointed because my expectations were way unreasonable. Well today for lunch, I wanted Italian beef. I've had the cold Italian combo sandwich here before and a few other subs and they were always great. The artichoke salad is really good too.   I ordered over the phone to avoid the lines... half Italian beef sub with provolone, and a side of Giardinara peppers. I went to pick it up and it was ready right away, and for everything it was only around $7. I read in another review that they don't dip the whole sub, and I like mine really juicy, but I figured I'd still try it. Well they provide a side of au jus so you can dip it yourself, so that was exciting. I got back to work and started eating... omg, it really was so so good. With each bite it tasted better and better. The hot peppers I got on the side made the sub though (I think that's what I was truly craving all along). It was hot and juicy and the au jus was more than enough. There was a lot of meat, which was tender and perfectly cut, not a singly fatty piece and it was all evenly distributed on the sub. Sometimes I have to rearrange my sandwich to even out the meat but this was perfect. It was so good. I was really full by the time I finished but still wished I had ordered a full. The only negative thing I would say is there were too many onions and green peppers for my taste. However, I'm not mad about that because I'd rather there be too many and I can pick some off rather than not have enough and wish there were more.   The guy that always takes my phone orders is seriously the nicest guy ever. (I think his name is Joe?) He's so pleasant on the phone and just as nice in person. He'll give you his personal recommendation if you have questions and he'll help you make decisions if you're super indecisive like I am. I love this place and would highly recommend it to anyone. They have such a wide menu that there's really something for everyone!",

The market itself has a great selection of pasta, sauces, biscuits, and wine. The food itself is great.  The menu was huge and I kinda got lost in it so I ended up ordering a half turkey and provolone sandwich on nine grain, a cup of minestrone soup (which came with bread) and a side meat ball. The sandwich was good, it wasn't the best but good for the price. The minestrone was yummy. And the meatball was AMAZING!!! My fiance had the cheese steak sandwich, which was very tasty, but the clam chowder was pretty bland.   The wait was a bit long, but we really were not in a hurry so it was not a big deal. Also, the salads looks great. The next time I come here, I'm definitely getting another meatball, maybe try one of the other hot sandwiches and one of the salads.",

    "text": "I know, its annoying to all you AZ peeps when I say, \"I grew up in NY with good food.\" I accept that it is impossible for you to understand what it is like to rarely have bad bread, bad cold cuts, bad service or just plain have a place that isn't trying staying around. Of course, us east coaster's are leaving out all the corporate places; the same Chili's, Applebees, Boston Market...etc stores are back east as well (most of them) and they suck just as bad there as they do here. What we mean is that the places that everyone goes to in our old neighborhoods are like Defalco's.   Defalco's is like no other place I have been to here in AZ. They have amazing food, great bread, Boar's Head cold cuts, and italian groceries that I didn't even realize I couldn't find until I saw them here. Amazing...just amazing.   They have chicken cutlets. NO ONE IN AZ HAS THESE! It is kind of ridiculous that an easy to make, menu staple (in the east) is impossible to find out here. I have seen them on menus, they were actually chicken tenders. Cutlets are chicken breast, breaded with Italian spices and egg, pan-fried and then baked. Defalco's has awesome cutlets! They use them on their Chicken Parmesan sandwich as well. That blew me away!   They also have Dilusso Genoa Salami, if you haven't had it...you haven't had salami! This gem of a store is a constant stop when I am anywhere near it, or have family visiting. If you haven't been...just go!  Side note: If you are expecting to be told what is on the sandwich, give up eating sandwiches. When you order, tell them the things you enjoy eating on bread, they'll assemble it, bring it to you and then you eat it. It ain't Quiznos or Subway, this is good food. If you can't figure it out, walk away and eat crap, come back when you know what you like!",

I used to work for a very picky Sicilian man that ran a pizza restaurant and cleanliness was right next to food quality and freshness. This place has the same overpriced who knows how long they have been sitting canned stuff all the others have. And I find this not very appetizing. As for my sandwich, I would have liked a fresher loaf, the bread was dry, meat was good but ended up overly chewy and the \"sub roll\" overpowered the sandwich.",

I can't leave with just dough though, it's usually accompanied by kalamata olives, margherita pepperoni and a can of sauce. It's a blast to make their pizza at home but it's just as fun to browse the shelves while picking up the ingredients.",

Being originally from NY I know what good marinara sauce is (a 10) and this is about a 7.5. But I must admit it is better than most of the ones I have tasted in Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurants.  They are definitely nice people and they do their best to serve you quickly.  I would only return if I were in the area.",

I visited on a Saturday when I had nothing to do other seeking some decent quality Ricotta cheese and Amoretti cookies.   What a charming place. My only regret is in not arriving hungry since I'd really like to try to their sausage sandwich.  I don't eat Italian outside of the home very often since I'm usually more pleased with what I cook, but in this case, I'd really like to try their food.  I overheard two people dining and one said to the other \"I can't wait for you to try that sausage to hear what you think of it.\"  Clearly, based on reviews, seeing what diners were eating and overhearing comments, their Italian sausage must be loved by many.  I bought the Ricotta, cookies and an interesting bottle of Pinot Grigio.  I'm not sure if it was all priced fairly,  but I was just pleased to see the selections of Cento brands, interesting Italian wines and San Marzano tomatoes!",

See, ever since I took a trip to Tuscany a few years ago, I am always faced with yearning for the freshest prosciutto, the perfect cheese and bread, and a wine to wash down the salty, meaty goodness with. E ecco!   I ambled in and was awash in Italian grocery goodness. The giant gallon-sized cans of Extra Virgin Olive Oil with the Italia stamp on it made me long for the olive gardens of yesteryear, the truffled gelato in the freezer was whispering sweet nothings to me... I had to hold myself back fiercely to not grab a basket and start purchasing everything.   I stood in line patiently-- it was mid-afternoon on a Saturday and there was quite a bit of traffic. While I waited, I stared in the refrigerated glass counter at the stuffed mozzarella balls, the various Italian salads and fresh-cut meats. I moved closer and laid my eyes on the menu. There she was: \"Il Purista,\" the greatest-sounding sandwich ever: Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Tomato, Roasted Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Balsamic Vinegar. Che fortunato! I ordered it from the surly Italian guy behind the counter. The sandwich was the perfect combination of flavors, but what was most impressive was the pile of prosciutto on it. I could not believe the quantity, quality and savory goodness. My mouth waters just thinking about it.  However, due to the fact that I had to wander around their close quarters for about a half an hour before I got my food, I think I will call ahead next time. They do have a sign that warns you about their process taking longer than usual, so I consider myself warned and cannot wait to sink my teeth into their food again soon!",

In addition to being a deli it is also a small Italian grocery with numerous wines, oils, cheeses, and meats.  I originally stopped in for their Philly Cheese steak and, having been to Philadelphia this past year I can honestly say this sandwich earns that name, so delicious.

Customer service is very good and prompt but the food is menza menz based on the cheesesteaks, Italian sandwich, and tuna sandwich. Found the cheesesteak to be somewhat salty and bread dry and lacking flavor. The steak meat was top quality with very little gristle and cooked properly but the overall saltiness detracted from the experience.  The Italian sandwich offered better quality bread but still was lacking the punch of flavors you'd expect from a great sandwich. Very good quality meats nicely assembled but still did not meet expectations based on the reviews. I believe the tuna was a mix of the two grades of tuna and again very bland. I did see a few people eating pasta and should probably try next visit since it did appear to be fresh pasta. The store itself is fairly well stocked with both frozen and dry goods as well as several selections of jar sauces and various Italian specialties and, of course, a deli. It's nice that they offer a nice selection of bottles of wine and/or beer with your meal or for take out but overall, based on the sandwiches I tried, not the best sandwich shop in the Scottsdale area.  A special Thank You to the staff member who brought a bowl of water for our dog while we ate outside, that's customer service!",

The only thing that upsets me about it is that now I'll have a hard time trying some of the other items on the menu.  From the reviews I have read, a lot of people have long waits when eating here, but I did not. I think if you can work around peak restaurant hours, you shouldn't have much of a problem. Also, the staff was pretty nice to my group and me.   I'm addicted. There I said it. DeFalco's brings the East to the Southwest, and it does pretty perfectly. It's a must if you've moved from back East and want a little taste of home, or if you've never been out that way and you want a little taste of what you're missing.  Bravo!",

    "text": "Since moving here from Boston, I've been rather disappointed with the quality of food. Everything from pizza to Chinese food has really been nothing but let down after let down... especially the Chinese food... man is it bad.. like, you have to try to make Chinese food this bad.. the only real saving grace is the Mexican food and the happy hour (lets be honest... quality of food is NOT what you're after when going to happy hour).   That's why, when you do find a place around here that is head and shoulders above the rest, you need to tell everyone about it and always go back. Defalco's is just this kind of place.   I pretty much agree with everyone when it comes to the cheese steak. Sure my arteries trembled with fear when it saw a massive amount of ooey gooey cheese rolling their way. but i didn't care... it was one of the best cheese steaks I've ever had. It was comparable to, or maybe even better than, my favorite from back east... La Cascia's Bakery & Deli's cheese steak (Burlington, MA). it had the perfect amounts of steak, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and cheese. as bobby said... goddamn..   Some lady also got a Chef Salad that looked out of this world. its an old fashioned Italian deli so its all high quality cold cuts and lot of them!   One last thing too rave about is, this place has has a lot of stuff that you cannot find in the grocery stores around here but were readily available back east. all of the Italian sauces, pastas, oils, vinegars, etc... next time i cook I'm definitely getting most of my stuff from here.",

    "text": "Finally, my first chance to try DeFalco's.  Not gonna add much that hasn't already been said, but yes its awesome.  Super authentic Italian deli and grocery store.  The interior is a maze, the food is incredible and the prices are just right.  Tonight for my first visit I got a full Il Purista sandwich, a traditional cannoli, and a glass of Italian red wine to boot.  Total cost was about $20.  Came out in just over 5 minutes.    I'm not quite ready to say the sandwich was up to the level of one that I had at San Francisco's Molinari deli, but its pretty damn close.  The sandwich has tons of prosciutto and mozzarella, plus basil, tomato, red peppers, EVOO, and a balsamic vinaigrette.  I got mine in an italian baguette per their recommendation.  The sandwich was huge and the ingredients were fantastic.  The cannoli was also excellent with a rich creamy filling and sweet shell with just the right amount of crunch.  So yes, the Yelp reviews are accurate and the accolades are well deserved.  Anthony DeFalco and his family have done an excellent job carving their own niche in a valley restaurant scene saturated with Italian establishments.  Here it's not just about the pizza or the pasta, its about the whole Italian culinary experience from the restaurant, to the grocery store, to the butcher, and so on.  Truly a valley landmark in every sense of the word.",

On my most recent stop I got the Il Purista sandwich which is one of my favorites the fresh mozzarella with pungent fresh basil, roasted peppers and the great Prosciutto come together in a flavor overload on a great sandwich roll. How fresh and high end the ingredients stand out especially with the mozzarella as it has a much more distinct and rich flavor and texture than the more bland store bought stuff.  I also added a cannoli to my order which was great. A lot of places make cannoli that is just too sweet and this was the right mix of sweet and savory. The other nice part was that it had just enough chocolate chips to provide a good flavor without overpowering the sweet shell and creamy ricotta.  In past trips I have gotten the meatball sub, chicken parm sub and the pasta and meatballs.I can tell you that you can't go wrong with any of it.",

It's been a favorite stop for years and the many others dining and grocery shopping prove their perfection.  The imported mortadella with pistachios is something I haven't been able to find since I lived in San Francisco! Thank You Defalco's!! Worth the drive from anywhere!! I can take the 72 bus from Tempe and be there in no time! Patricia St Vincent, Maple Ash  neighborhood, Tempe",

It looks like they're usually busy and bustling inside; there are shelves of Italian groceries for sale. I wanted to browse while I waited for my order, but didn't see a way I could do so without getting in someone's way. Perhaps next time!  The person who took my order at the register was very polite and helpful with my questions. I got my order to go, and it was very nicely and securely packaged.   On to the FOOD. I ordered a grilled chicken pesto pizza, and it was out of this world! Their menu says a small is 12 inches, but my pizza easily looked more like 14-15 inches, which meant leftovers for later! YAY! Delicious pesto sauce, flavorful, marinated chicken, and great crust. Winner all around. I also took a pignoli cookie for dessert: crispy outside, fluffy inside, made with almond paste and toasted pine nuts on top. Ah. Maze. Ing. I was in heaven.   I can't wait to try more of their menu! I'm just sorry I took so long to give this place a try.",

The tiramisu was exceptional. By far, this is the best tiramisu I had in Arizona. I would definitely visit this place again for pastas and lasagnas of course.

As I driving up I saw three cars pulling up and three more cars leaving with to go orders. I knew I was right spot!   I walked in to grocery/restaurant with deli counter with plenty of seating throughout. I quickly grabbed a menu and browsed for bite to go! I was amazed by all of the selections on the menu with half options for many of pastas and sandwiches.   I walked out with chicken parmigiana sandwich w/ Greek side salad and strawberry cheesecake! I must admit I as expecting homemade sauce and authentic taste and they knocked it OUT THE PARK!   My sandwich was very delicious with homemade tomato sauce and juicy chicken with melted cheese!   Strawberry cheesecake... Better than Cheesecake Factory! Very delicious   I will be back",

The grocery part is still yet to be tested by me but they have a wide selection of wine, oils, cheese, meats, pasta and other things.   They make the food quickly, fresh, and you can see it with an open kitchen.   I usually get the Philly Cheesesteak no onions and no mushrooms, extra peppers. It has been consistent and phenomenal every time. Never disappointed in the amount and I always leave full. The cheese is melted perfectly for me and I thoroughly enjoy it. Maybe one of the best Philly in Scottsdale.   I get the pasta salad and antipasto salad as sides because I don't eat all the bread. All of it is great, fresh and I tastes wonderful!  I will obviously be back and get items from the deli/grocery to try them out. Super excited and I will be feasting.",

No waiting and a relaxed pleasurably lunch on our own terms.    Everything sounds great on the menu and really end up doing a flow chart - hot or cold?  If hot, pasta, sandwich, pizza, etc. and if cold, salad or sandwich.  I went with cold.  The side of Antipasto Salad was so generous and had chunks of meat, cheese, peppers, olives and oil.  The meat were chunks right from the deli with Mortadella, Capocollo, salami and all were excellent.  The cheese and peppers along with the spices, made the salad taste fantastic.  I also opted for the whole Maximus, again with the spicy prosciutto, and Capocollo, Mortadella, Genoa Salami provolone on focaccia.  The bread was soft and fluffy with a airy crumb that was seasoned to give it a hit of extra oregano.  The sandwich was dressed with cold, crunch iceberg, tomato, onion, mustard, mayo and of course, Italian dressing.  Excellent flavor combination - highly recommended.",

The Grocery is much smaller and they have sold out to making pizza and sandwiches their priority and not service to real Italian food lovers.  When you call you are usually greeted with some kids running three words together so fast you can't comprehend as they immediately put you on hold and forget about you.  I stopped in twice now and you can't even browse the store items without having to weave in and out of the Starbuck's Drive-thru SUV driving, can't cook crap consumers, standing and waiting to place an order to go.   Are you a deli-grocery? are you a sit down restaurant? are you a crazy busy take out place? Make up your mind.. I'll go get my fresh dough and groceries from Tony up in Sunnyslope. I can get there and back before I can wait my turn at this atrocity.   PS: to the take-out consumers.... try making your own pizza sometime with ingredients from a real Italian grocery. It's so easy, park your SUVs, do something that makes your home smell good and your kids appreciate a home cooked meal. Enjoy!  To the owners, buy a store next door and give us back our grocery.",

I really like the sausage they use because I can taste the fennel and it just ties everything together. Lasagna is pretty expensive to make at home. (All I know is that when my bf and I made homemade lasagna, we spent almost $80 on all the ingredients. But maybe we splurged too much on expensive cheese idk lol)   A slice of lasagna here should set you back $9. Not bad because it is a pretty hefty serving. I always have to take half of it home, especially since it's served with a piece of garlic bread.  We also tried the cheese ravioli. Scrub mistake. Order the meat ravioli because the ravioli is already good, but the meat takes it over the top. I love their red sauce so much I could drink it.  The first time my bf and I came here, we thought one tiramisu cup was going to be enough for the both of us. It wasn't. The tiramisu is so creamy and the amount of coffee is just right. Now we always order 2 tiramisus so we don't have to fight over who gets the last bite :)  The restaurant is pretty cozy inside but I think the environment definitely makes it a cute date spot for good food.",

    "text": "My wife and I are each half Italian so I like to say we make a whole Italian!  I've been looking for a place like this since I moved to Arizona more than 30 years ago - an authentic Italian grocery store that also serves prepared dishes.  For us, this was everything familiar - familiar brands, familiar ingredients, familiar treats and sweets.    We ordered in and did a little grocery shopping as well.  Their prepared food is outstanding and the real deal.  Their groceries and other items are a tad on the pricey side but that is expected when you want genuine Italian brands and you need them quickly.  Although we live a couple of hours north of Defalco's, we do visit the Valley frequently and this delightful establishment will become a regular stop for us when we find ourselves nearby.",

I had the Italian sausage sandwich which was the featured item on the \"Diners Drive Ins and Dives\" episode. It was pretty good but nothing too special. I also had the penne with vodka sauce and I thought that was better than the sandwich. On the side I ordered a meatball to have with the pasta and that was good as well. For dessert, I had a cannoli which was great. I also had the chance to talk to the owner who was also in the \"Diners Drive Ins and Dives\" episode and he seemed like a genuine guy.

I had to take her there so she can experience what my wife,myself and my daughters have experienced in the past. Perfection!!  We got there earlier than usual because of when my parents eat dinner and it was great timing before the Friday night crowd came. My sister loved DeFalco's and was so mesmerized with all their items,including the wines and Imported items that you can't find in most places.  I had to have their Pizza Bianca White Pizza), which as usual was delicious. My wife has their Chicken Parmigiana, my Dad had Spaghetti and Meatballs (incredible), my sister and my Mom had the Eggplant Parm, and my daughter had the Chicken Fettuccine. Of course we all tried each others and all were amazing. Oh,I ordered the Fresh Mozzarella Ball to share and dip in sauce. Every dish was amazing.   My family are originally from NY and ate some great food there, and I am so grateful to have found a wonderful place like DeFalco's where they make great Italian food.    As I have stated before, if you want a fancy place go there,but if you want great, inexpensive, consistent Italian food,go to DeFalco's....   OMG, make sure you have some of their desserts..",

I ordered a half because the last time I ordered pasta, the whole order was almost enough for three meals!    I got the pasta and opened it up to make sure everything looked okay, and was astounded to see the amount (or lack there of) of pasta in the container. I took it back up to the register and asked if this was correct as it just did not seem right. One of the cooks in the back came out and said \"yes, this is what you ordered. We do 6 ounces of pasta for a half order, you have the pesto sauce and then this is what we add on for the sausage\".   Not only was he not pleasant, but if I had known the half order was going to be the size of my fist, I would have gotten the whole, especially considering they charged me $11.50 after all was said and done.   Certainly not worth the price and did not meet the taste standards that I am used to associating DeFalcos with.   Big disappointment.",

Would  I never find another sandwich that could compare? Can I eat this sandwich for the rest of my life?  The answer was Yes.   Another favorite here is the Chicken Parmesan. This is by far the best marinara sauce I have ever had, smothered on the best breaded chicken breast on this earth.  The grocery is neat, a bit of a novelty, and seating is sparse. I enjoy sitting in the more private section to the right of the entrance. Prices are fair, and you can split most entrees between two people.  Would definitely recommend to anyone seeking authentic Italian cuisine!",

I did think it was very kind of him to say you are ordering too much when other restaurants would have not mentioned it and been happy to have a bigger order. Robert was placing the customers need as the top priority.  Our guests ranted and raved about the food and of course the cannolis.  Everything was hot, fresh and delicious!!!! I couldn't have been happier and the cost was extremely reasonable to feed 60 people.  Highly encourage you to try their Italian grocery for dine in or carry out.

My go-to item is the Cheesesteak (better than any cheesesteak you will get in Philly.) The Mac and Cheese is out of this world, seriously the best I've ever had. Their homemade pastas and pizzas are super legit too. Not to mention they have a great Italian grocery selection. I like to grab their pre made pizza crust and toppings for pizza night at home. Did I mention they have amazing deserts too? Only downfall is you are immediately going to need to renew your gym membership once you leave.",

The nice thing about DeFalco's is they are willing to give you what you ask for, unlike some other Italian grocery market in Scottsdale. DeFalco's Italian eatery is the hot spot to go for lunch, dinner and take out. They do a great \"to go\" business, all with a smile and a thank you. They have a great looking deli counter.  I couldn't walk out the door without grabbing a Cannoli to go. That too was very good. So, if  you are tired of hearing \"no or we don't deviate from our menu\", or \"no you can't have a small side of red sauce with your Calamari\", then you should give DeFalco's a try. They appreciate their customers and it shows. They are willing to make you happy and give you exactly what you ask for.",

The linguine (pasta options are spaghetti, linguine, fettuccine, and penne) was a bit mushy but I liked the basic marinara sauce - it had some heat with lots of red pepper flakes. The sausage was bland - I would go for the big, fluffy meatballs. The garlic bread had a lot of herbs but was also surprisingly bland. This place is inexpensive and laid back - it has a family owned feel that I like. Everything has a lot of options as I mentioned above, and you can do half or whole orders (half was plenty for me). There is a soda fountain and free refills.   Based on my spaghetti and sausage meal I would give 3 stars but that meatball sub was honestly amazing. Next time I am definitely getting a sandwich!",

Waited 20+ min for the sandwich and when they finally brought it out it was on white bread when i asked for wheat. So right off the bat i was peeved. i didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for a damn sandwich so i sucked it up and put my big girl panties on and ate it anyway. it was alright, honestly just another sandwich.  However they do have a considerable large choice of meats, cheese, pasta sides etc..i am a girl who likes choices. The atmosphere was also interesting as well, ya know, the whole Italian grocery store thing inside a restaurant is pretty creative.",

The tomato sauce for my parm tasted like it came right out my of school cafeteria from when I was in grade school. I went at a time when there were very few customers (about 7:30pm) and the wait was a little ridiculous, about 25 minutes.   However, the bad aside, there were some things I liked a lot about this place. One was the layout, its a bit confusing but kinda fun. The tables are kinda strewed out through the store and its kinda cool eating among the various grocery products. Two, they had an excellent bottled beer selection with a very wide variety. Three they had an excellent happy hour special, 3 dollar imports, 2 dollar domestics.",

I had the chicken Parmesan which was awesome; my husband had a calzone with sausage, pepperoni, onion, and peppers. The sausage and pepperoni were made right there and were downright bitchin! We ended up shopping at their store too and picked up some salami and cheese for the trip back home. I wish that we could have something like this in Wisconsin, we would be there all the time!",

You have been to Italy before and you want to relive that Italian food adventure but not leaving the confines of South Scottsdale 2. You want to have some of the best Italian Beef or Philly Cheesteaks sandwiches you have ever had.  3. You are in no rush for your meal  I have been to Defalco's over 15 times while leaving in Phoenix. Their food is superb, the staff is friendly and the experience is always consistent. The only glaring problem, which they address with a sign on their front door, is it takes FOREVER.   This is the closest you are going to get to an Authentic Italian Delicatessen in Phoenix.  The food while eating there is delicious but I would also suggest having them set you up with a Pizza Kit so you can make authentic Italian pizza at home. It is delicious easy and very affordable.   However if you are a cheesesteak lover and you go to Defalco's and don't order it is a sin. It is a huge hot messy mouth watering I can't believe I finally found such a delicious sandwich.   The portions are huge so keep that in mind and it's not the cheapest or quickest place. But it is the BEST Italian Deli I have been to in PHX.",

The italian dressing was meh. No spices- just oil and vinegar. I expected it to be a special homemade type of dressing since this is an italian deli.   Both my husband and son had the cheesesteak. They loved it. The roll was great and that is very important to the whole package. It was meaty as well. My husband liked the fact that the cheese was mixed and melted into the steak. Not on the bottom of the roll or laying on top. My son didn't like the fact that they didn't have WIZ but he is a teenager and  well...if you have a teenager you know where I'm coming from.   Even though we liked it, we like Philadelphia Sandwich Company better and it will be hard to go right by it to go to DeFalco's.   Another quick thing to mention. The guy taking our orders was not rude but his attitude was \"I'm doing you a favor by standing here taking your order\". So....I don't know if he was hung over or having a bad day but it was our first impression.",

My husband was made fun of in Spanish by an employee over his France football jersey. Funny thing is my French husband is fluent in Spanish. Next time wait until your back in the kitchen to make fun of customers. Philly cheese steaks mediocre. Most of the food in the deli case was old and crusty. The place was disgusting, too many employees standing around doing nothing as well. It was actually uncomfortable to be stared at while we ate. Also noticed health code violation of storing food items directly on floor. We bought a few food items to go and a lot of cheese, my husband forgot his wallet at home and had to wait for me to pay. The manager on duty proceeded to laugh in his face. This place is a joke and we will never spend our hard earned money in this establishment again.",

We've ordered takeout here for work on several occasions, and just recently I was able to eat at Defalco's for the first time. What I've realized? The line is absolutely well worth it. I've tried to order a different sandwich every time and every time it's been just as amazing as the last, if not better.  I love how the line goes through the store, allowing you to see all the wines, beer options, foods you can buy and the deli section in slow motion before you make it to the counter. Next time I am definitely getting the German potato salad!  Two minor issues I had with eating in last time: 1)  One of the displayed beers, a microbrew I look forward to every year, wasn't actually available. 2) Upon going up to the counter to get a refill on my beverage the man taking orders was very upset. He told me the people in the line were gonna come after me. And I'll stop there. I think this took longer than actually refilling my drink.",

DeFalco's is a hybrid, both a place to eat, and a place to shop. The store looks a little cramped, but there is definitely space for everyone, dont let the looks decieve you! Their menu is relatively large, and definitely fair in price (10-15 dollars per meal) for the quantitity and quality of the food you recieve. Personal favorite is the Chicken Alfredo. It's just Chicken Alfredo, but it is done right, every single time. Their pizza is also amazing, decent cheese to sauce ratio, and the crust is perfect! Food is delivered to your seat, whether that be in-store, or the outside patio they offer. They also offer to-go. Their fountain drink selection is pretty standard, Pepsi products + Dr. Pepper. They also offer a variety of unsweetened teas, all of which are delicious in their own right.   DeFalco's has amazing food and amazing quality that they offer their guests every single time. When you come here, you come in expecting great food, and leave with great food in your belly (or hand)!",

The food all in was solid with a couple of snags.  I saw reviews about slow service, and that is the rub.  We had two couples and we ordered back to back.  The first order came about 15 minutes later, which is no problem.  After my wife and I had waited a full 30 minutes and our dining partners were nearly done eating we went and found someone to help us.  They brought us the food then, and while good, the Alfredo was lukewarm, meaning it was sitting up there ready.  WTH?  I suspect the issue is with their numbering system which is out of sync.  We watched a table that ordered 10 behind us get served far before us.  Why?  They had the number 24 and we had the number 45.  Just a guess that the delivery guy was picking off the lower numbers, or going random.  Either way their is no first in first out process in place.  We will go back, and expect to have to bird dog our order.",

    "text": "I have been craving for pizza for awhile now, so my friends and I finally decided on defalco's for their Italian food. It was a right choice. :)   Quick tip: I was rather confused in terms of how to order at first because it was a grocery store and a restaurant at the same time. Unlike the others, they have tables and chairs between the aisles so there isn't really a clear separation between the grocery store and the restaurant itself. Once you enter, you can just go ahead and stand in line to order, then find a table afterwards. Think of it as getting a sandwich from Safeway!   I ordered the II Purista since almost everyone on Yelp recommended it. There is a variety of bread you can choose from, like marble rye, sour dough, and wheat, etc.  I ordered the crispy baguette to go along with it. The sandwich was very fresh and the mozzarella cheese in it was very spongy! It was good and I'm so proud of myself for getting it.   My two other friends ordered the calzone and the pizza margherita. I didn't get to try the calzone because it looked huge and stuffed with cheese. It's just like a pizza folded in half. I knew I was going to get sick if I ate that, so no thank you. However, the pizza was PHENOMENAL! My friend says in order to know if an italian restaurant is really good, he always order the most basic margherita to test it out. It didn't disappoint. The basil leaves were super fresh. It was great!!!",

    "text": "My first visit to Defalco's did not live up to my expectations.  Ordering food at the counter is sufficiently quick and orderly.  Though, I had to ask how I was going to receive my food, because there is nothing to imply they will deliver it to your table.  I guess they simply remember your face or something.  Within a few minutes, my order was delivered to my table outside on the patio, but I still had to convince the young man that, yes, I ordered a half meatball AND a half cheesesteak.  Sheesh.  Don't judge me!  The sandwiches come with a small pepper on the side.  Both were very good, but I have some complaints.    The meatball wasn't as warm as I would have preferred and the bread they use makes their sandwiches difficult to eat, especially the meatball.  The bread they choose to use is big, flaky, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, Italian bread.  I don't like it.  I hate trying to maneuver my mouth around a sandwich that is obviously too big, so my only choice is to flatten, mold, and manipulate the bread to where it is edible.  Doing this invariably creates a meatball mess, because the bread is not properly designed to contain meatballs and marinara sauce.  Though, cutting it up into smaller portions seemed to work.  The cheesesteak was delicious, but the one-note, repetitive flavor became overwhelming towards the end.  I think it was the cheese they use.  It overpowers everything else and diminishes all of the other elements to an imperceptible degree.  I couldn't even taste the onions and green peppers.  The meat was also barely perceptible.  Too much cheese, I guess.  Though, I did appreciate the fact that I could squish the cheesesteak without making a mess, which was the complete opposite of the meatball.  Overall, Defalco's is still a great place, but personally I prefer Casella's.",

The calzones to warn you are just as huge as they are delicious. The gnocchi in pesto was great and cooked perfectly. And the bruschetta sandwich was different than expected but still a good size and taste, once again was perfect. All of the pasta and noodles will be just what you're looking for. The allla vodka was perfectly creamy and rich! I can't give this little spot enough praise and suggestion if what you are craving is home cooked heavy Italian food.",

The tables are too small and there is hardly room to get to the station where you get soda, water and silverware. I prefer to dring water with my food, but the water tasted funky. Oh yeah, when we got our food, they didn't bring any silverware, so I maneuvered over to the station and they were out of forks. So I had to go to the pickup counter and ask for forks for my wife and me. The glass of wine I got (Chianti) was very stingy in quantity and bitter. This place is so tiny that we didn't feel comfortable talking because our business would become everyone else's. We ordered eggplant parmesan and spaghetti and meatball. Meatball singular is what you get, pretty lame. Prices are too high for what you get in this no-frills place. Some inconsiderate employee was hogging the restroom way too long. On the plus side, the food tasted good and they did include garlic bread and salad. But the salad came at the same time as the main dish, so that does me no good. I don't think I'll return, at least not for dinner, maybe lunch or for pizza to go.",

Whenever the boyfriend and I drive down Scottsdale Road the boyfriend ALWAYS has to mention that he wants to try out Defalco's...so, last night I did my homework and yelped Defalco's before giving it a go.  I decided the reviews were pretty damn awesome and that I would have to go by for lunch.   Ok, this place...so amazing.  It's seriously like Italy decided to give birth to a small little grocery store in the middle of a pretty lame plaza to grace Arizona with its presence.  It's got racks and racks of Italian wines, balsamic vinegars, Italian breads and sweets.  They've also got some frozen pasta to cook up in your own home. Anyway, let's get to the good stuff.  As many have mentioned it does get packed during lunch so expect a wait.  The boyfriend got a full chicken parmigina sandwich. It was pretty good and a HUGE serving.  He got it on the soft roll and they do not skimp out on the chicken.  The roll was filled with perfectly breaded chicken breast, topped with a simple, yet flavorful marinara sauce and of course...so cheese. YUM. Like I said it was pretty big and filling and it was $7.50.  I took fellow Yelpers suggestions and got a half order of the beef cheese steak with mushrooms, onions, and peppers. Heaven in the mouth for $5. Enough said.  One star off for the wait but it was worth it!",

While it's setup as a mini market/ deli, the market offerings are a little pricier than i've seen elsewhere.    Back to the subs tho - great crusty loaves, high quality meats, and made in True italian deli fashion. The also offer some traditional italian dishes if you're in the mood for a real meal.    While I usually just get a quick sub or am picking up some things to go, there are some tables to sit at if you choose.  Plus the people are pretty laid back and friendly.  Only complaint that I have is the traditional Euro-style reusable and communal towel in the restroom.  A little hard to shake considering how many people don't wash or don't wash properly.",

There were only a handful of people ordering at the time & in the store.  I'm assuming they were short handed that day, or had to fly all the way out to Italy to get our frickin' sandwich fixings.  The sandwiches were mediocre at it's best.  The sandwiches tasted bland and cold cuts were dry.  The crapeteria here at my work makes better sandwiches than this place.    I guess the saying, \"you get what you paid for\" is definitely True here & for a 1/2 sandwich at $4.25, I shouldn't have expected too much, especially when I've been accustomed to some awesome sandwiches from Genova's Delicatessen & Specialty's Cafe & Bakery.  One good thing about this place was the guy behind the ordering counter.  He was friendly, upbeat & extremely helpful.

    "text": "Everyone knows that Tony Soprano didn't die, HBO merely made the ending ambiguous so that America would be shielded from the awful truth that he was planning to move away from the East Coast to none other than Scottsdale, Arizona. Why you ask? Because where else can you carry on business dealings in a strip joint, be involved in \"waste management\", act out of control all the time, philander, defraud the government...and fit right in? But for he and many other recent transplants from Jersey, the truth is part of Scottsdale's allure rests with places like DeFalco's Italian Grocery.  Sitting in a worn strip mall in an older section of town, the scene almost evokes a little hint of the Garden State. However, the good news is that I've never seen anyone whacked in the spacious parking lot...or wearing a Members Only jacket for that matter. Upon entering, there's a claustrophobic sensation as you see the grocery aisles creating a slightly labyrinthine path to the deli counters, which are separate based on ordering prepared or raw food. Upon reaching the prepared food aisle, you'll invariably see a microcosm of Scottsdale, ranging from senior citizens to high schools girls using platinum cards to buy lunch for the whole family. (Luckily though, no sign of Carmine Gotti just yet.)   The menu? It's a pageant of sumptuous meats and cheeses, and they even offer I-talian soda to go with. It's so good, you might think like many a famous eatery it's a front for the local outfit. While I don't believe that to be True...(it is Arizona after all) the owners certainly make purists and old school Italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo. The food also will seem dry, but that's only because they are careful not to drown out the meat's character with too much mayo or other condiments. Some may not like it.  Price-wise, this place is pretty much a steal. It's a shade more expensive than Subway, but not much more-so. But as Scottsdale goes, it's almost unbeatable. They also accept plastic and have a loyalty card, so as you can imagine, you'll want to come back often if you know what is good for you.  Since it's a deli, there's no waitstaff. Still, service is total class. People are friendly, and professional so that it still feels family-owned and not corporate. The tables are usually clean in the seating area, and spaced evenly enough that you won't feel like someone just broke your legs.  But then there is the one detraction to this place: the supposedly endless wait for your order. I've never been on a weekday, but weekends I have found are pretty manageable. For some people it won't  be like Jack-in-the-Box, but if you order ahead you should avoid some of the hassle.  Of course, part of the allure going to an Italian restaurant in the cultural attitude about savoring life, food and a slower pace than our Anglo-Saxon roots ultimately prefer. Unless, that is, you have reservations to Buca di Beppo...but that's another story entirely.",

Real Italian creme sodas, deli, desserts, GROCERY STORE, you name it, they have it. We were visiting our daughter in Scottsdale. SO GLAD that she knew about DeFalco's. WOW, WOW, WOW!!! I had the eggplant Parmesan (it comes in two sizes, I should have gotten the small!) and my husband had their Italian sausage and peppers sandwich. My daughter had alfredo and her boyfriend had the meatball sub... all sandwiches come with your choice of homemade breads. The deli counter looked amazing and the smells... ahhhhhhhhhhhh! The first time we stopped, my husband and I shared the turtle cheesecake. The next time we were in the area we stopped specifically for their lemon cake... WOW! If you are in the old downtown Scottsdale area and you love Italian, YOU HAVE GOT TO STOP at DeFalco's!!!",

    "text": "4 1/2 stars!  Oh Defalco's.  You drain my bank account and you take up my entire lunch hour just driving to and from but I don't care, because you are delicious.    By far the best authentic Italian deli in the Valley, I have yet to have one thing there that I didn't love.  They have a gigantic menu of options, featuring everything from hot and cold sandwiches, pizza, full hot pastas and entrees like the intoxicating chicken parmigiana, and a stacked deli case of side dishes with easily the best pasta salad I've ever had.  Family owned and operated which is another littler perk in my opinion.  Let's put it this way.  My boss is usually in town for a week to a week and a half every month and he still manages to eat there at least 6 times...it's that good.  They freshly bake all of their own bread daily, which is excellent.  I prefer the Crispy Baguette with my sandwiches because it is oh so flaky and wonderful.  If you've got extra $$ to throw around they also have a quite nice-sized grocery selection right in the deli featuring authentic Italian delights.  I'm talking everything from 30 different types of aged balsamic vinagrette to over 100 different bottles of Italian wine.  The only reason I have to take a half a star off is because if you make the fatal mistake of going there between the hours of 11:30am-2:00pm M-F and you did not have the foresight to call your order in advance, you will sit there for 45 minutes, EASY.  But now that I have mastered the timed call in approach, it is wonderful and you should all go if you haven't : )",

The lasagna has not been the same since the first time I ordered it and reviewed it so glowingly; every visit I always get the spaghetti (and by the way, the one time I ordered meatballs, there was too much breadcrumbs.  Wait, what?  When does that happen?) has been mediocre at best.  The last six visits-that's SIX visits - it's not hot enough.  Look, I \"can\" the busboy it's not hot enough, but he doesn't know saute'.  Apparently, neither do the cooks. The chef?  Management?  No one's home.  Look, I know it's deli masquerading as a restaurant...but it's still supposed to be a restaurant.  The lasagna, which I thought was awesome, the spaghetti is cold...why am I going back?  That's the tough part about the restaurant business: every single day is \"SHOW ME\".",

    "text": "Italian is not my #1 choice but my husband has picked Deflaco's for dinner twice in two weeks! We were so pleased after our first visit that we went back not too much after. This place is great in that they have made-to-order sandwiches, pastas, and pizzas and also a wide selection of groceries.  The first time we went was on a Friday night & it was packed! Even though the line was long, the time it took to order & also get our food was reasonable. I decided to get the Grilled Veggie Sandwich & Penne/Mostaccioli side salad and my husband got the Calzone & Tortellini Salad side salad. The sandwich & side salads were both very colorful and tasted great.  I think the sandwich would have benefited from having the herbed mayonnaise inside the sandwich instead of on the top to really get the flavor of it on the veggies. I honestly should have just asked for an extra side of it since I always like there to be a generous amount of spread / sauce but still, I enjoyed it.  I was a bit hesitant in ordering the Penne side salad because it had salami & pepperoni. The meats didn't have a strong flavor though, so I wasn't even able to tell that the pasta salad had any meat in it (until I ate the pieces of salami & pepperoni), very good! The tortellini side salad was equally good, and in this one as well, the ham didn't have a super strong flavor. I'd recommend either one but if I had to pick, I'd go with the tortellini.  My husband enjoyed his calzone so much that he got it both times we were there. The first time, he got a 10\" one with mushrooms and the second time, he got the 12\" one with sausage & mushrooms. The calzone was was really cheesy and had quite a bit of toppings. The best part though (in my opinion) was the marinara sauce that came with it. So good!  I had gotten the Margarita Pizza the second time & even the 12\" was huge, I was literally able to get three meals out of it. I enjoyed the flavors that were on it but this wouldn't be my number 1 place to get a pizza at ... yet. I am interested in trying out just a cheese pizza with toppings & the White Pizza too.  Overall, 4.5 stars for flavors, ease of ordering, & the good service (especially considering it's a grocery store). We saw them bring out fettuccini alfredo & lasagna to other tables & they looked amazing. I can't wait to go back & try their other menu options.",

    "text": "Wow.  Defalco's brings Italian food to a whole new level! Do not be deceived by their name, it is a grocery store but they have a restaurant tucked away in there as well and you do not want to miss out. Hidden behind the aisles of delicious shelf stable Italian food, as well as fresh you will find a deli, as well as a counter where you can order pizza's, pastas, calzones, sandwiches, salads, desserts, oh and the best philly cheese steak sandwich (don't question this just get it!)   You will probably have a hard time anytime of the day or week finding seating in here, it is a really small place, but if you have the patience it is not impossible to get a seat, and you do seat yourself. So if you come with someone and you notice an open table immediately send someone to sit there even if they haven't ordered yet, because chances are that when you're done ordering it will be gone.  You can also purchase wine here by the glass or the bottle, if you want some you might as well buy a bottle because the glass will run you about $7 dollar and you can find some decent ones on their shelf for around $15. Just ask for some wine glasses and for the bottle to be opened. No corkage fee either.  I would choose a meal here over a fancy Italian restaurant any day. The calzones blow my mind even their simple cheese calzone is amazing. They come with marinara on the side, not inside of it. This prevents it from getting soggy. The dough is light, crisp and perfect.   The pastrami sandwich is the best I have ever had. The Philly cheese steak sandwich is also the best I have ever had. It makes it so hard to choose!  They also have these little marzipan cookie/cakes that are so delicious for only about $1. Along with a wide array of other desserts like cannolis.  So if you are in the mood for Italian head to Defalco's everytime.",

The first time I went, I ordered a margarita pizza and was not very impressed. But luckily I decided to give it another shot. They have amazing desserts and sandwiches. To be fair, I am vegetarian but some of my favorite items here are the grilled veggie sandwich (make sure to specify your bread at the register or they will select for you), the vegetable and artichoke lasagna, the caramel fudge cheesecake (it's literally unreal...), and the lemon ricotta cookie. Once you find an item you love on their long, extensive menu, you won't stop coming back to Defalco's. The prices are also amazing. A whole portion (they have whole and half) tends to be at least 2 meals for me. They also have a great selection of cheeses and grocery items such as frozen pastas and ice cream. Definitely check this place out!",

Either way, you cannot go wrong!  We have been coming here for over eight years, going back to their previous location. They've grown and yet they still need more room.   At DeFalco's we love the food, the Italian sandwiches, the cold cuts (mostly Capocola), bread, frozen Ricotta filled Ravioli, Wine, and that was only our shopping list for today.  LOL  As I said in my Check-In, it's hard to get out of here for under a $100. But it's money well spent!",

This ensures at least that the ingridients in the deli are authentic. I picked the reuben and my boyfriend picked the prosciutto. Both were on fresh bread that had wonderful texture. I choose to have the corn beef on my reuben and it was cooked perfectly. It reminded me of home.  I also purchased there lemon bar which was cooked well and tasted fresh. Had the right amount of lemon flavoring without being overwhelming.  We arrived at 7 pm and they seemed busy. I was slightly confused on where to order but I also believe I misunderstood the signs directing the customer. At the end as we were leaving we were handed a loaf of bread for free. It made my day!  I will definitely be returning again and will test out different times to guage the best times to go!",

    "text": "My fiance and two of our friends went to Defalco's for dinner tonight. I ordered the Meat Lasagna (half portion) which came with garlic bread and let me tell you..it was quite possibly the best lasagna I have ever had! The sauce was fantastic, perfectly seasoned. My fiance ordered the Pesto chicken sandwich, which I sampled. The bread was wonderful,chewy and slightly toasted, not like those terrible deflated buns at most sub shops, that they somehow manage to make shatter due to over toasting when bitten into. The bread itself was amazing here, coupled with juicy chicken and an almost floral fragrant pesto. Worth every bite!   Our friends ordered the Vegetarian lasagna and Pasta Alfredo. The Alfredo was buttery but needed pepper, which was fine since a lot of people don't like pepper and there were salt and pepper shakers at each table so the customer could decide if they wanted it or not. I didn't have a chance to sample the veggie lasagna, but by the pace at which it was eaten I assumed it was very good. All our orders came with a side of garlic bread that was absolutely fabulous, I would come back here just for the garlic bread.   This place is also a grocery store and so I couldn't resist but buy a jar of Puttanesca sauce and an order of tiramisu to go (which is sitting in my fridge as I type this), which I must say, sounds like a marvelous breakfast. Overall I really recommend Defalco's, they have an extensive array of wines, cheeses, meats, pasta and other products, particularly gelato. Don't miss the tubs of gelato in the freezer section in the most delectable flavors. I didn't buy any this time but definitely will the next time I go here.",

They even have Lupini, if you know what that is, you are Italian. Fun just walking around the place and looking at all the stuff they have. Then there is the deli. While waiting for my pizza I stood and watched the items coming out of the kitchen. I wanted to take a bite from each of them. Everything looked just great. Got a pizza to go, the only problem was that traffic was heavy and it took me 40 minutes to get home.  I wanted to grab a slice from the box while driving but I just could not manage it as the slices were quite big and I think it would have ended up in my lap rather than my mouth. Even though it was a bit cold it was still quite good, great crust, nice sauce, cheese could have been spread a bit rather than just big slices placed on top. A bit light on the mushrooms, tasty pepperoni, but all and all a pizza I would return for. I only wish it was closer, if it was, I would be there several times a week.",

    "text": "I stopped here yesterday after arriving after traveling all day from the East Coast. Needless to say after airplane snacks I was starving.   My wife and I have a tradition of going to at least one Diners Drive ins and Dives location in every new city we travel to.    We ordered an Il Purista sandwich on whole wheat roll to take back to the hotel.  While waiting for the sandwich to be done we perused the groceries and wines they have in the store. They have everything imaginable for a great Italian meal from antipasto to dessert. We ended up buying some fig cookies to nosh on as well.   When arriving at the hotel we dug in. The sandwich was prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato, roasted peppers, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The wheat roll was soft and worked well with the sandwich. Total cost for the sandwich, two drinks and cookies was about $25.   The best compliment I can give this place is that it reminds me of Italians Delis back in Hoboken.:)  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Scottsdale.",

It has been on my list for years, and yesterday I had the chance to have a late lunch there - I'm so glad I did!  There are a few Italian deli / markets around town, but by far this is the best one I've been to.  Of course they have a nice selection of Italian imports that will help make your meal the best it can be, but walking past the counters seeing the menu I knew I was in for a treat.  I went with a sandwich, since it was my first time, which was easier knowing my girlfriend would order the shells and cheese with a meatball on the side.  I got the Il Purista - it just made sense.  Fresh basil, mozzarella, prosciutto, tomato and topped with a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar - it was perfection on a deli roll.    The shells / cheese / meatball / fresh tomato sauce were everything you'd want in a bowl... the ricotta was hands down the creamiest and freshest I've had the pleasure of eating.    Topped it off with a beer and a healthy serving of Italian nostalgia for a lunch that everyone in Phoenix should have at least once.  I did notice that they cater for large groups / events and this will be on a short list in case I ever need anything along those lines.  GO HERE and enjoy!",

I couldn't finish mine but it was even good heated up the next day. I cant wait to come back to try their pizza and some more of their salads.  They also have a large selection of wines, pastas and various other snacks so Its a great place to do some shopping for home while you wait for your food to be prepared.

I got there right before the lunch rush so I didn't have to wait at all to order. I ordered the Italian sausage hot sandwich with peppers and onions and my boyfriend got the steak and cheese hot sandwich.  We ordered to-go so we had some time to poke around in the grocery part of the store while waiting for our order. Mostly the wines and olive oils which looked like a good selection.  It took about 10 minutes for the order to be ready. It seemed like a lot of people call in their orders ahead of time (note to self.)   The sandwiches were pretty amazing. I'm actually not usually the biggest fan of sausage but since this place is known for it I wanted to try it. If this is what sausages are meant to taste like I feel like I've been missing out my whole life. It was impossibly moist and flavorful. It didn't taste too \"sausage-y\". I don't know if that will make sense to anyone else, but the \"sausage-y-ness\" is what I dislike about most sausages. It was topped with their red sauce which was wonderful and the Italian sub roll was perfect.  I'll be back for pizza and desserts.",

When he finishes the call, he walks away from the register without saying anything. Meanwhile, a family is asking if they can clear some tables of dirty dishes since there was nowhere to sit. When our food was brought out, the lasagna was somewhat warm, but the eggplant parmesan was nearly room temperature. The garlic bread was so loaded with butter that it was soggy and also room temp. I don't know why we ordered desserts- maybe because we were still trying to figure out what made everyone suggest dining here? Well, we ordered 3 items to go and purchased a couple of items from the grocery. After leaving, we found out that the cashier failed to give us the tiramisu. We will not be returning.",

I told him that's quite the hefty statement and chose to go with the Italian Combo sandwich and also told him I'd give the ol' Cheesesteak a shot next time. This guy seemed to know what he was talking about. I then decided to grab a side of two of the pasta salads and try them both. I also got a side of their marinara. My bill total was $19. So cheap!  So I take the food home and I am really expecting this to be absolutely amazing since the reviews on this place are off the charts. And...the hype is real amigos. I tried a bit of everything and I couldn't find one thing to complain about. I hate going to hyped up places because I'm afraid they'll disappoint but I stand by this hype.

I thought it would just be sandwiches, but this place is an Italian restaurant with a deli / grocery store front!  The Veal Parm was awesome!  I came back the next day to try the famous cheesesteak and it was incredible as well.  I do admit the cheese was kind of strange because it was melted into liquid consistency, but the taste was awesome!  If I had another day I would have tried the pizza because it looked just as spectacular.   I also got a chance to speak with the owner and he was really cool.  The wait there is a little much, but when you are ordering food like this you have to certainly expect a wait, and there is a sign on the door warning customers of this, so it should be no surprise.  Some reviewers complain about the prices but for food of this quality it is really a bargain!  This place is the real deal, I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "This place is fantastic. It looks like a deli that they put a bunch of italian groceries in and some italian baked goods. Its not a small place, but it feels small because there are so many shelves of groceries and not that many tables. Anyways, there was no line and ordering was very fast. They make you walk past the baked goods and deli meats before you get to the register to order, so look away if you know what you want and don't want to end up ordering extra baked goods and taking deli meat home! After you order, they give you a number and you find a place to sit. They will come out with your food and call the number when you are done. All-in-all, fast process.  On to the food! My girlfriend had the Gnocchi with Alfredo Sauce (you could also order it with a Pesto or a Red Sauce), I had a Lasagna and Half of an Eggplant Parmigiana Sandwich, and we shared a Chocolate Cannoli. First off, the Gnocchi was the BEST I have ever eaten, which is saying a lot because my girlfriend orders Gnocchi EVERYWHERE we go that serves it. The texture of the Gnocchi was perfect; tender, but not too soft. The alfredo sauce on top absolutely completed the dish and complemented the little potato dumplings perfectly. I highly recommend the Gnocchi and Guarantee you won't be disappointed. The Lasagna was good, definitely above average, but it was missing my favorite part of Lasagna, those delicious burnt edges. The Eggplant Parmigiana sandwich was good, but the breading on the Eggplant Parmigiana didn't have any crunch to it. I know that Parmigiana isn't supposed to have a lot of crunch, but I just wanted a little. The Cannoli was awesome. The shell was dipped in chocolate (you don't have to get it this way) and stuffed with the classic ricotta cheese-based mixture, which I think had some chocolate shavings in it. If you like cannolis, definitely give them a try here.   In conclusion, I will be back, and I will have to try a cheesesteak, because they are supposed to be legendary and that seemed to be what 75% of people came in for.",

    "text": "This place is a great NY/East coast style Italian grocery store that offers a wide variety of pastas and sandwiches.  I've been coming here since my ASU days and found Defalco's to be a good deal for the money and taste for sandwiches. I almost always get the sausage sandwich or the baked penne as they have become staples of my visits there.  Recently, I tried the pre-made pizza dough ($1.99) that only requires rolling out and baking.  It takes a little effort, but the results were spectacular. The only downfall is there can be a bit of a wait to get helped (which they now have signs up for this) and their actual groceries are quite pricey.  There are some decent deals on anything that is pre-made, but the wine, pasta, sauces, and deli meats are pretty high on the price scale. This place is a great place to grab a bite to eat, but don't buy too much of your groceries here unless you are looking for that True Italian ingredient to make your recipe exactly like in Italy or some rare item that can't be found anywhere else.  Otherwise, it's definitely worth stopping in and at least looking around.",

    "text": "When the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie, that's...Defalco's.  It's hard to find a good deli, and after living in New York for six years, it's almost impossible to find one that matches up with the Big Apple.  We walked in, and the first thing to come to my mind was, \"Where to you order?\"  As you walk in, the grocery store is the main focus, with Italian spices, snacks and the best part, wine, filling the store, I wasn't sure what I was in for.  The ordering counter for the sandwiches is in the very back, not to be mistaken for the deli counter right next to it (though after looking at the selections, you can be assured that I'll be back for that too.)  The selection ranges from a multitude of sandwiches, to basic Italian pasta dishes.  It's always nice to not have to meander through a menu when you are hungry.  Along with the two people I was with, our order was placed.  The prices seemed very reasonable, and we also were able to order a beer from the counter.  I ordered the Italian Sausage sandwich with roasted peppers, one friend got the chicken parmigiana and the other copied my order, but with cheese.  The dining area is very simple.  One are is designated for tables while other areas happen to have tables in areas throughout the store.  We sat down, and to our amusement, they had three flat screen TVs up for people to watch sports.  It's playoff time, so we took in the AFC Championship game.  Our food came out rather quickly when one of the guys from behind the counter came out and called our number.  (Note: keep your receipt after getting it because they right your number on it.)  I dug into my sandwich like an Ethiopian into a Big Mac.  The sauce was wonderful.  Rich in flavor, it had a certain spice that brought out the perfectly cooked peppers and the sausage.  The sausage was perfectly cooked, but to my dismay, there was only one sausage in it.  Now I have to admit, I love Italian food, and I might be a little soiled for my time in New York, but I was hoping for a little more.  My friend who got the Chicken Parm let me take a little sample (sacrifice for the good of a Yelper) and I would give it two major thumbs up.  Sauce good, chicken good, pasta good.  I got a little jealous, but don't get me wrong, the sandwich was awesome.  Defalco's is a great place for a quick bite or even an intimate evening for a couple who doesn't want the hassle of a restaurant.  The food was good, and though I might have had issue with the portion size, that could be me just being a large man wanting more of a good thing.  I would also recommend Defalco's for those of you who would like to make romantic dinners at home.  Italian food is very easy to make, and who could deny Lady and the Tramp as a wonderful representation of Italian romance.  One thing for sure, this Tramp would take his Lady to Defalco's.",

While she was pregnant, she asked if they could call her anytime they made a batch, and they did!  This place is usually incredibly busy yet quick to take care of the customers.  So for them to take the time to give her a call and let her know about a desert was impressive.  We take friends here anytime they are in from out of town.",

Seriously!!  I could look at the selections for an hour and still be just as lost, I am sure you could eat at DeFalcos every day for 30 days at least and not have the same thing twice.

    "text": "This place does brisk business and for good reason. They have excellent food at massive portions (for the pastas).  I waver between eggplant parmesan and chicken parmesan and I learned not too long ago that you can ask for double the bread instead of bread + a side salad. I mean, I'm getting Italian food and pasta - why have any shame about the amount of carbs I'm consuming?  Speaking of, for ~$10 for eggplant and maybe $12 for chicken parm, it provides at LEAST three meals for the whole size, and sometimes even 4 when I'm not too hungry. You truly cannot beat that- especially since it's always so delicious!  They have lots of stuff for purchase (hence the grocery name) but I've not purchased anything grocery-like except for ice cream. They have tons of drink options, including wine by the bottle for those taking out. Wines by the glass are surprisingly enjoyable for ~$6-$8 a glass (had the red blend and sauvignon blanc this visit).  For the deli items, they have pre-made deli salads, olives, and tons of cheeses at really good prices. They also have sausages but I'm personally not a fan (of sausage in general, so I've never had theirs).  I like a locally-owned place, and this fits the bill, being super close to my house, very affordable and yummy. I've lived nearby for about a dozen or so years, and I feel like I see a few familiar faces when I visit which leads me to believe they treat their employees well also.  Minus a star for - Using such potent/pungent cleaning supplies in that bathroom that the stench wafts into the dining area, further limiting the amount of seating available (it's been REALLY bad on my last three visits) - Being super stingy with napkins for diners. Our table was dirty and rather than ask the busy employee to clean it, I wanted to self-service with a little water and not bother him - I was told that napkins come with the food.  Sure...that's fine, but when a patron asks for that to clean their own table, you either 1) get the napkins with no comment or 2) clean the table for them. To their credit, I was brought napkins promptly, but why aren't they out for messy people to grab as needed? I'm eating spaghetti for goodness' sakes!!",

The person sitting next to me on a flight had mentioned it to me over a year ago and I was amazed I remembered the name. Thank goodness I did. This was one of the best meals I've had. The Alfredo sauce was creamy and flavorful but not too think or too thin, and not too cheesy. Even the garlic bread that came on the side was wonderful. The carrot cake was so delicious that I never wanted it to end, and even went back after dinner and bought a slice to take home. My boyfriend loved his linguini with clams and the pesto pasta salad was delicious, though I just tried a bite and we took the rest home. They were busy the whole time we were there but the counter service was fast and our dirty dishes were cleared promptly. We love 30 minutes away but will definitely be back over and over.",

    "text": "Really hate to do this but: We are vacationing in Scottsdale for 3 weeks and went there last week for the first time.  We did take out and were blown away by the food, selection and quantity. Being Italian and from Boston I am usually pretty critical when traveling, but this place hit a home run! I mean the food was GREAT!  Today, 3 days later we go back for more: Mistake!  We ordered the same thing-Chicken Parm (full meal), again take out, and wow what a surprise.  Last week it was 3 palm sizes pieces of chicken and a cup or so of pasta.  Today it was ONE, almost palm size, piece of chicken and 3 cups of overdone pasta accompanied by what looked like the scrapings of the family salad bowl, not to mention (very) soggy wheat bread garlic toast-UGH! (It actually looked like someone put yellow curry on stale bread and steamed it!)  Good food is a tremendous accomplishment and a great asset for any restaurant, but it must be consistent or its all for not. If you're looking for hard to find Italian grocery items, you may find them here, and if you're lucky the food will be as awesome as it was on our first visit.",

So of course I had to bookmark and try this place.   Walking in there's shelves of Italian groceries but in between are tables to sit at. Inside are usually tables for two but outside they have bigger tables. So you order at the counter and they bring your food to your table.   So I ordered a half meatball and half beef cheesesteak with grilled onions, peppers, and mushrooms with a Latte. I'm always looking for the best meatball sandwich in town and would have to put this at the top of my list. Freshly baked and toasted bread with two huge meatball and fresh mozzarella. Man this all came together. So good. So fresh. Loved it. The beef cheesesteak with thinly sliced ribeye was so good. The beef was so tender and juicy with that creaminess of the cheese and fresh mozzarella with peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Oh my goodness. Freaking good. Hit the spot. To top it off the latte just made this lunch to freaking over the top. Loved it.   My daughter and wife split a full meatball sandwich which they couldn't finish. Plus they ordered a cannoli. Oh my goodness. We all took a bite of that cannoli it was so good. Out of this world. So creamy. So good. You just have to try this. My son ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo and he really liked it. Finished it all up.   I really liked this places. The tables are small but the atmosphere was great. Great food. Good and friendly service plus they are Sun Devils. So Forks Up and enjoy",

Had the baked ziti, it was good, not amazing, but good. It's a minor complaint but the garlic bread was not particularly good, it was almost stale you could tell it was made a few hours before. Nor was the bread crispy or toasty, it was meh. The salad was OK, had a jalapeno; why? I don't know. But like I said the baked ziti was good.  I would go again but I would order a calzone.",

    "text": "This review is mainly for the customer service, a 2 at best.  The food is delicious and authentic.  DeFalco's lacks more staff and ordering lines for dine-in service during peak times.  This is based on a Saturday at 1:45 PM.  One major issue is the failure to place menus upon entering.  When waiting in line to order, there is easily a 10-15 minute wait just to get to the counter and place the order. We were stuck behind several customers with no knowledge of the menu until they made it to the counter.  Then another 10 minutes to figure out what they wanted.  Meanwhile, the line is out the door, so the deli slicer begins take orders from several customers BEHIND us, cutting the line.  Three line cutters until we spoke up for the actual \"next in line customer\".  While this was going on, we asked our 12 year old to grab a table that was just being cleaned off.  The employee told my son that he couldn't sit there but have no reason.  My husband had to approach the employee and ask and she shrugged her shoulders.  Still clueless why my son was told he could not sit at the table when I saw at least two other adults sitting at the table they grabbed.  Our food was ordered at 2:08 and arrived about 20 minutes later for two subs (1 hot 1 cold).  We enjoyed the meal but terribly turned off by the lack of customer service.  DeFalco's- I know you can do better.",

DeFalco's offers an extensive menu (both for takeout and dine-in), and although I venture here 2-3 times per week I remain loyal to a few selections on their menu.  If you are feeling like a sandwich I urge you to order the homemade Meatball Sandwich on the crispy baguette - or - if you're feeling like chicken then I must recommend you try the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (again, on the crispy baguette).  I'm a hot/toasted sandwich type of girl so I can't speak for the cold sandwiches, but I can assure you won't be disappointed with any selection given that all their breads are delivered fresh daily, meats and cheeses are sliced to order in house, and their toppings are fresh to boot!  To complete my go-to list I also recommend trying the Chicken Pesto Salad and a few side salads including the tuna pasta salad (BEST EVER), the chicken caesar pasta salad, pesto pasta salad, and....the tomato and basil salad (of course you must drizzle a little evoo and balsamic to make it truly Italian). They also offer many pasta dishes, pizza/calzones, soups & sides, salads and desserts, oh my, and nothing will leave you disappointed or starving for more since their portions are generous in size (it's an Italian thing)!!    And not only does DeFalco's do Italian favorites just right, but their store is also stocked with Italian specialty foods for purchase (hint grocery in the name), and many wonderful and rare wine selections only to be found in their store.    My Sunday dinner now belongs to DeFalco's as it makes me feel like I'm back at Grandma's place.  Heck, you can sip on some vino while you await your lunch or dinner to be served in the dining room or outside on the terrace!  And although this beloved establishment resides in Scottsdale, please remember to check your pretentiousness at the door because this place is loved for its traditions and laid back people.",

This place is really, really good. Lot of authentic Italian choices and they even have a grocery section with tons of legit Italian goodies. I had a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich that was to die for. Anytime my ex-manager comes back to town (he left for Vegas and I think he misses Defalco's more than anything else in the valley), he is sure to stop by and grab his favorite grub.  Parking is a bit tricky during busy hours and the wait times for food can get a bit long, so I recommend calling your order ahead of time (unless you want to take a look around while you wait, first-timers).",

The building is an Italian Grocery with imported (albeit expensive - - 5.29 for the box of crackers I saw, they must be basted with Olive Oil by Mama Celeste!) foods everywhere.  You order from a little counter in the back, and you can choose from pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches among other things.   I had half a grilled portobello sandwich, and half of the Cappacolo and Provolone.   The portobello was meaty and came with a thick red pepper covered in their homemade pesto. The Cappacolo was the star of the meal, however. Thin slices stacked high with some of the best tomatoes I've ever had in Arizona.   It's pretty inexpensive too, spending more than 10 bucks a person would leave you with a belly bursting.",

    "text": "When I first moved to AZ, this was the first place I felled in love with but it has been 5 years now and I finally made it back (after several visits back in the day).  Today I had a sweet and sour experience.  I was craving the lasagna but I'm trying to keep the diet so I ordered the soup of the day (minestrone) and a pasta side (penne with tomato sauce).  The soup was superb (that's why it didn't get 2 stars). The focaccia that came with the soup was pretty decent and the ice tea (green tea) was pretty tasteful.  But the side pasta was totally forgettable. The sauce was pretty lame.  And the worst, I got Parmesan cheese for the pasta and I poured a little bit on top. It was like talk but that didn't bother me. However all of the sudden I started getting this weird smell. The cheese was stinky. Not like in a delish stinky French cheese, more like in a Whoeverbertos-sh@#hole-cleaning-table-cloth stinky. It reeked. Fortunately I didn't pour much so I was able to manage to eat the pasta but it was bad.  I didn't even bother to tell them since I was so upset.   Anyways, I'll go back for sure because the several other times I really enjoyed this place, but this was a bad experience. Plus $ 11 for soup and side pasta is not like super cheap.  My advise: Smell the cheese before pouring it in your food!  One more thing. The spoon was super old and bend :(",

I got 2 halfs instead of a full sandwich because I couldn't decide between the two. I could only eat half of each of the halfs. And then for dessert I had a chocolate covered cannoli. It's a fun ambience with tables spread around the Italian deli. Looks like a great place to shop for meats and cheeses as well and they also have a lot of Italian related ingredients. I look forward to coming back soon ( but unfortunately don't live around town ) and trying a few of the other sandwiches - it was hard to choose so many look so good and the meats were so fresh.",

The place is small and kind of cluttered, but there's no denying its charm or quality! Half grocer, half deli, Defalco's is legitimate Italian cuisine, and I constantly meet people who've lived in Italy (or that are from traditional italian families) picking up groceries there. (The biscotti are wonderful!)  When going in for lunch, I highly recommend calling ahead, as there's typically a long wait to get food on your lunch hour. The hot sandwiches are great (chicken pesto being my favorite!), and the salads are decent. I had the chicken pesto salad last time, which was a little heavy on the dressing, but still good.  All in all, if recommend if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive lunch with fewer than 5 people. Beyond that, seating is difficult. Call in your order to expedite the wait time!",

I tried the Half portion meat lasagna which comes with a side of garlic bread. If you order the full plate, it comes w a salad. But the half portion is enough to feed any appetite.  The sauce was amazing and the Lasagna had tons of cheese with homemade sausage which literally made me tear as i was eating this meal. Will return many times as i have found a hidden gem.  Place was also clean. Not a big dining area, thats the only negative. They would be wise to expand this place as the food is amazing. 5 stars easily!!",

We usually just do take out or just buy items from the grocery part of it.  They have a great variety of dried pastas, wine, cheeses, oils and vinegar's, etc.  Whenever we have friends over we love to order a variety of pastas for pick up.  What the two of us end up doing most often is just picking items out from the grocery to make homemade pizza.  Their fresh pizza dough is seriously to die for.  And it's only around $1!  If you don't see it in the fridge be sure to ask.  They usually have some in the back.",

The deli meat selection is perfect, they have one of my favorites, Parma Prosciutto, which is basically pork candy. Oh yeah, and they have Molinari salami..the crack cocaine of dried and cured meat...  I live in the Far East valley and routinely drive out of my way to DeFalco's. After you try it you will too.

The dining area was packed so I decided to sit outside in the patio. The person delivering the pizza to just dropped it off didn't bother to ask if I needed anything else, LIKE NAPKINS!! When I chased him down and asked, he said \"go to that counter and ask him\" WOW that was rude.  Anyway, pizza is good not awesome or anything but pretty good.   Don't know if I could recommend this place to friends based on that \"RUDE\" person.  Maybe get some nice friendly waiters or waitresses?",

I had heard about Defalco's from Diner's, Drive-Ins, and Dives on Food Network so I knew I had to at least walk into the place. It wasn't until literally the last hour I had a rental car in Phoenix that I was able to stop in. If you've read my review for Kramrcyk's in Minneapolis, MN then you should have guessed that I ABSOLUTELY loved Defalco's! It's just what I was hoping it would be - cozy, inviting, authentic, family-owned, and a personality that could only have evolved through generations of experience.  When you first walk in you are greeted by shelves and shelves of Italian goodies and a meat counter. I noticed a very diverse group of customers sitting all around the restaurant section of the store which was a great indicator that the food was likely muy delicioso. I was a little overwhelmed with the menu selection because there were so many items but went with the beef cheesesteak because it was the most yelped about option.  Let me just say that THE CHEESE STEAK DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It probably would have been the best sandwich I have ever had if pickled jalapenos would have been thrown in there. The beef was tender, well seasoned, not too salty, not too bland, just perfect. The mushrooms were grilled long enough to be soft but still have a bite to them. The grilled onions were caramelized and tasted amazing with the melted cheese sauce drizzled on top of the sandwich. The bread was soft, fresh, and not too dense. For a sandwich that was probably 2000 calories, it felt like I had just eaten a light and refreshing meal.   Parking is very easy, it's in a strip mall so spaces are ample. Prices are reasonable for a deli and service is fast.   I definitely recommend this place if you find yourself in the greater Phoenix area aka, Scottsdale.",

    "text": "A local food establishment that make a wide variety of Italian sausages by hand and they also make their own spaghetti sauce - everything is made to order, from what I can tell, so if you order food to eat there also order a glass of wine - they have a number of red and white options and find yourself sliding into the Italian frame of mind while you wait for your food to be prepared. In addition, I almost always get an order of hot Italian sausage so I can make my own spaghetti sauce at home. Along with the sausages you can get canned tomatoes from Italy and any number of delicacies from the land of pizza and pasta. I must like this place because I have a strong urge to stop in every time I'm in the area. A wonderful little bastion of Italian food culture.",

I had both the Cheese steak and the Chicken Parm - both are excellent choices and it's hard for me to decide on a favorite. I would like to try their pasta sometime here which only means that I should come back here on another visit.  The location is a bit tricky to find at first but it's not too bad, it's right across from the China Wok right across from the parking lot. I would recommend calling ahead and ordering your food beforehand as they are quite busy during the lunch rush. As it is part grocery and part restaurant I would also recommend take out if they're busy since there's not much seating.",

The cashier is friendly, the food is fresh and  tastes above average and the portions are big, but not so big it is offensive (Cafe Delux I'm talking to you). Also they have lot's of good drinks like Diet. Dr. Pepper in the fountain or Dr. Brown's soda in the bottle.   Some dishes I tried and liked include: Chicken cutlet sandwich, Chicken parm dinner and sandwich, chef salad, chicken pesto sandwich, turkey sandwich, blt, tuna salad, baked ziti, all the soup - oh - and the mozerella caprese sandwich is the best thing on the menu.

One time, we scuffed up the picnic table that Gerry had just built for his employees breaks. I took about a week off cuz I heard there was a contract out on me. But the sammiches pulled me back in, and I apologized and ordered bologna.  After moving downtown and losing out on my sammiches, I started revisiting them in their new, expanded location on Scottsdale Rd. Same great people, same great honest food.  Here are my favorites:   * Boars Head Bologna, sliced thin on Italian roll with lettuce, mayo and swiss cheese   * Ham Cappy on Italian, lettuce, mayo, mustard and dofino   * Chicken Parm w/red sauce on wheat roll   * the weird salad with penne and peppers and salami chunks  And give their pizza dough a chance. It's my new favorite for making thin, bubbly pizzas on a stone at home.  Please Tony, keep it in the family. Pass it on.",

The sandwich was hot, fresh, and flavorful; the latte was very tasty, not bitter; and the cannolo was excellent. We had a look around the grocery while we waited.

    "text": "This is by far the best deli in all of the Valley (OK, that's noy saying a WHOLE lot), and may also be the best sandwich place too.  Every single thing on this menu is great, from the caprese sandwich to the lasagna. And don't forget about the Italian sausage...delicious!  Plus, the people are super-cool and the environment is friendly and comfortable.  Only two drawbacks:   1) The wait, especially on the weekends. This place gets busy, and it takes them a really long time to make stuff.  2) The bathroom still uses that old cloth towel rotator thing...you know, the one you have to pull down in segments? That thibg is really gross, and may not be at all sanitary. Seriously, do they just keep using the same one huge cloth the whole time? Does it get replaced, or do the just wait for it to dry and then rotate it back in? Either way, I don't see how that's a good idea.  Ok, sorry I spent so much time on that. For God's sake, I gave this place 5 stars you'd think I would concentrate a little more on the positive!",

We didn't order anything fancy, just some sandwiches and a side of macaroni & cheese for our daughter (we ordered a side because they don't have a kids menu.) The sandwiches were great, just the right amount of meat and the bread they make there was delicious. But, the macaroni & cheese, someone must have sold their soul to the devil for that recipe. It was so good. Even our four year old said it was 'really, really, really good.' It lucked out for us that the side was a full bowl because when she was done with it, my husband and I got to finish it off. We will be going back.",

The Crispy Baguette is the perfect vessel for all of these fresh and imported ingredients. We were lucky to get in and wait just a short period of time for our order.

The eggplant by itself was very tasty, but get it without so much bread, you will thank me later.  We will be back to try something else.  I went at 11 am on a Saturday morning and still waited over 30 minutes for a take out order.  It is a very crammed space, a little Italian deli in between a Italian grocery store.  The prices for the Italian pastas and cheese are a bit over priced.  The espresso is nicely priced at $1.40 for a single shot.",

    "text": "One of life's greatest pleasures is revenge, and I can't think of a better place to dish it up than at Defalco's.  Here's how.  It's Saturday and the girls are looking for a place to lunch. Recommend Defalco's, explaining how their sandwiches are off the planet.  When you get there, hang back and order last. It's a small place with nowhere to loiter once you've ordered, the girls will be forced to a table.  Now the revenge. You recommended the Italian sub to the others, saying how the portions are super small and to order the whole instead of the half. They believe you and order.   Only now, as none of them are within earshot, having wandered off to their table, you order a small cup of mixed olives, a plate of Italian cheeses, and a glass of Chianti. So very European! You won't find this anywhere on the menu, but Defalco's will make it for you special, it'll cost around 10 bucks.   Go take your seat with the girls and wait, as the server tries to squeeze three subs the size of Shaq's sneakers onto the table - right along side your tiny plate of cheese and olives.  They're mortified.  Staring at their 'subs' as all the hot ASU guys in this place are now staring at them. This, as you daintily pick up an olive, a small piece of cheese and take a sip of chianti while smiling at the girls.  Now enjoy, as your bitch 'friends' pay for that remark you overheard them make at Jessica's bachelorette party last weekend, the one about how your butt resembles Kim Kardashian's on steroids.  Have another sip of wine sweetie. Beautiful, isn't it?",

    "text": "Real deal Italian deli, or at least as real as you'll find in AZ.   My search for the best cheesesteak west of the ...well, west of Philly...led me to DeFalcos. The sandwich did not disappoint. Can honestly say that their steak fixings (steak, cheese, shrooms and grilled onions) rival just about any I've ever had. Seriously great. The only slight demerit comes from the roll. Just doesn't compare with an Amoroso imo. A bit too bready, crusty outside that cracks easily and makes that steaky goodness hard to handle. I think it would probably be perfect with something like an Italian beef. Probably try that next time. But if you're someone that wants to try a legit cheesesteak, they present a terrific option.  KT had the cappicola, soprassata and provolone on sub roll and rated it a solid 4 stars. Again, she thought the roll a bit \"dense\", but delicious overall.  Sides weren't too exciting, more than likely due to our late visit.  Red skin potato salad was the best; mozzarella salad had wonderfully fresh basil and tomatoes, but the mozzarella was not flavorful at all. Very flat.  Managed to have some dessert as well. DO NOT get the chocolate mousse cake. That way there will be more for me! Absolutely fantastic. And KTs lemon bar disappeared in a hurry. Nice cappuccino as well.  Very impressed.",

    "text": "Had heard great things about Defalco's and wanted to try it out.  We arrived and got in line.  There were only about four people ahead of us in line, but the order taking was going VERY slowly.  They finally opened up a second register.  The girl took our order, we paid, and went outside to sit.  After about 15 minutes or so they brought my husband's cheesesteak sandwich.  We had ordered some additional food to take to someone at home and he said that would be out shortly.  I asked about my stuffed shells and he said they were not on the order.  I went back up to the counter and the girl who took our order apologized and said it was totally her fault and that she had never placed the order for the shells.  She charged me, I paid, and she rushed the order. The shells came out pretty quickly, but by that time my husband had already finished his sandwich.  Luckily he decided to eat the piece of caramel fudge cheesecake he had ordered to eat at home later, because when he opened up the cheesecake box he discovered they had given him a regular cheesecake instead of the caramel fudge.  Again we went up to the counter to get our order corrected.  Instead of telling us to keep the regular cheesecake, they actually took that from us and then gave us the correct one.  I'm sure they just threw it in the trash.  Given the multiple errors with our orders it would have been nice for them to offer us to keep it. Overall the food was good, but the issues we had with the service made our dinner less than satisfactory.  Hopefully this was just a fluke, but not sure if we will risk it to try again.",

The meatballs this time were hugely better as well!  Firmer, more flavorful and much less salty.  Yummy!  As usual, the breads are delicious and the crab pasta salad with dill (the owner said it was his own recipe) was \"smack yo momma\" good!  I'm still having a problem with the desserts.  This time I ordered a Napoleon to go.  Now, let me say that Napoleons are my favorite dessert.  When I see them anywhere, I order one. PERIOD. This one was disappointing.  It had a chewy, gluey, texture.  The filling was just OK, and I wasn't a big fan of the flavor of the icing.  Just an overall disappointment.  Overall, definitely better than three stars.

The man who was tall with grey hair and a mustache had a hard time taking an order and was getting frazzled that I wanted just one 2.00 meatball which was offered on the menu. It started to get weird... He asked my mom if she was from New York (a car parked outside had NYC plates) she said no that it wasn't her car. He continued to say that she was acting like one, (whatever that means) and continues to say how he wanted to punch al New Yorkers in I the mouth. I was shocked at the fact that he oddly threatened my mother and would do so in such an open environment. Needless to say not going back. At least subway doesn't condone violence among women.",

I had the half Italian beef sandwich, I liked the taste of it with the onions and peppers on the crusty hard to find good bread. This half sandwich was big and sloppy and I felt like a pig woman eating it. They give you a tiny cup of au jus with it and a pepperoncini.  My husband had the Italian meat sandwich also on crusty bread and upgraded the cheese to the sharp provolone (.75 extra) and added roasted red peppers (1.50 extra)  They do sell hard to find Italian meats,and boar's head meats,cheeses,oils,vinegars,candy and pasta in shapes you can't find in your local grocery and many other things but not the whole (red) hot cherry peppers in vinegar that we were hoping to buy.  The sandwiches were good and overall maybe 4 stars but I still feel it is necessary to remove one star for the salad they made me last time.  3-8-12 just tried the hot cherry pepper spread....BAH not hot or satisfying one bit",

    "text": "I just moved to Phoenix and have only lived on the West Coast for a few years now, but I am Italian, born and raised in Brooklyn, NY to a family in the Italian bakery business in Greenwich Village for 30+ years, so I know what real, authentic Italian food and hero's are supposed to taste like. I know good food in general, and Defalco's blew my mind.   I ordered 1/2 of eggplant parm hero and 1/2 of a portobello mushroom hero, and it was the closest thing to NY food I had had in years from Florida to Los Angles. I thought I was back in Brooklyn. It was out of this world good.   My husband is a native of New Jersey, and he was stunned to see Taylor ham on the menu as that is a traditional NJ classic, and only people from that area would know of such a sandwich.   He ordered 1/2 of Cheesesteak hero and a 1/2 of Chicken cutlet parm hero, and though the Chicken cutlet hero was amazing, not one piece of fat and cooked to perfection, that Philly cheesesteak brought him back to his childhood at the Jersey Shore and was reminiscent of Pat's Pizza in Point Pleasant. He said it is the best he has tasted since moving out of NJ.   We just can't believe this family is not from Brooklyn because the food is as close to Brooklyn and East Coast as you will ever taste in this part of the country.   We were impressed and nostalgic after eating there today, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a taste of NY as you have always remembered it to be.   Simply amazing!",

It was our only visit to Defalco's during the trip but we'll be back during our next visit.  And if we lived in Scottsdale we'd be regular customers.  From Yelp reviews we expected to find a great selection of Italain staples, like dried pasta and canned tomatoes, and also a great deli selection of meats and cheeses.  We found all that and also great service in a welcoming little store with a helpful man behind the counter who handed us  a menu and offered help when we said we were just in to \"drool\" and get our bearings.  We ended up with a nice fresh salad of mixed greens and other veggies, like tomatoes and carrots, with a really good Italian dressing that had a perfect red wine vinegar bite, foccaccia, and cheese and olives from the deli case.  The prices were very reasonable for all.    The big surprise for us at Defalco's is what a good wine selection is displayed on the racks in the store of domestic and imported wines at a big range of price points from inexpensive to \"deluxe\" offering something for every kind of wine buyer.. We had fun browsing through those and picked up a wonderful Italian wine to take home at under $20..  The Leonetti  (Walla Walla WA) San Giovese whispered our name, but it's a tad outside our spending comfort zone at $70 / bottle...a fair price as it was marked, but not our speed on this vacation.   There was a good steady stream of what seemed to be regular customers in and out for take out as well as eat in (the pizzas coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled wonderful) which is a very good sign at the time of day we were there given folks were off work and on their way home.  Next time we'll definitely try some of the homemade Italian sausage and a calzone!",

The cold sandwiches are good, but I had a pizza sub once and it was probably the worst thing I ate at an Italian restaurant in a while. I'm sure there are other great dishes available. The bread is fantastic, though. For sandwiches, I prefer Dilly's Deli. I haven't had any of the pasta dishes, though.   PRICE: Decently priced with most items being under $10.   ATMOSPHERE: I love the market/restaurant mix that I see a lot of around Tempe. Defalco's offers Italian cuisine ingredients right when you walk in the door. My most memorable experience was when I was eaves dropping on several middle-aged/older men sitting at a table talking. They were obviously from New York with their thick accents and talked in an intimidating style much like mobsters. I would not be the least bit surprised if they were part of \"the family.\" Listening to their conversation and eating in a small Italian grocer was a great experience. Does anyone else notice that the bathroom is very large?  SERVICE: Nice and helpful staff.   SKINNY: I've had a bad experience along with good memories at Defalco's, so give it a try to see for yourself. But DONT get the pizza sub!",

They both were good. My husband loved his. I couldnt finish mine and it was pretty good.. probably get 4 stars that time.  This time when I arrived 11/2011 This time, I was irritated, because I got a sandwich and it was OK not to great and not something I would ever order again. The reason I am writing is the guy behind the counter seemed shady. He seemed like he was doing something he shouldnt. When he rang me up, he acted very weird and I didnt get it. When I got back to my office, I found out that the sandwich looked half made and there were no utensils or napkins. The whole feel was weird. I am not sure what was going on, but felt like he just threw the food in unmade and non tasty. I will give them another chance and still give them 3 stars, due to the first time, having good salads.",

So naturally we decide karma dictates we eat there.  DeFalco's is a market/deli/restaurant and is pretty much set up like a deli with tables.  You order at the counter and then they bring your food out to you. We ordered the Centurion calzone, eggplant parm sub and the sausage with peppers and onions sub.  All three dishes were great. We washed all that food down with a really good bottle of reasonably priced wine.  Before leaving I went to the counter to grab a to go box and I saw the owner (I recognized him from the Triple D episode) and I spoke to him a bit.  He was a really cool guy and you could tell we was really passionate about serving good food and   proud of his families long standing business. Overall great place, great food and service to boot.  If you are in the mood for classic Italian comfort food in a laid back setting or something to bring back home, Deflaco's is your place.",

We had the Italian beef sandwhich many times for lunch  and it has been the standard to which we compare others....tender, well seasoned beef, thinly sliced grilled onions (we don't like peppers so omit then) - delicious!!! Tonight we ordered some to go for dinner they erre plain awful. Beef was chewy and tough, and \"light\" onions somehow translated to big chunks of not well cooked onion slapped on top of the meat. If we stayed at the store to eat, we would have sent them back.  Even the best place going to have a bad night but the last few times the customer service has been poor also. Tonight the person behind the deli counter told several customers how busy he was and how he had been dealing with catering orders all day. The line was long, so politely keeping it moving would have been nice - like a lady behind me commented- everybody in line had a busy day too... Disappointed in the food, further disappointed in the service. Hope they get back on track.",

Looking over these photos and remembering how good these sandwiches tasted, I'd like to visit again soon, but recalling how long my wait was, and the negative vibes that bounced off the cook (that took my order) and another whom I thought was either an owner or a manager, I am very hesitant on returning.  :(  I did enjoy the sandwiches, especially the cheesesteak, even though half-way through my half-sandwich, I decided it was a little too salty.  I thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich, creaminess of the cheesesteak and kept me reaching for another bite of the eggplant!  Loved munching on the hefty wheat roll, but I didn't care much for the soft white roll that the parm rested on.",

Defalco's can get pretty busy during lunch time so if you're looking to get food quickly, I'd suggest ordering ahead. If you order in the restaurant, it can take some time so be patient, that's the just magical workings of Defalco's. They have a very friendly and helpful staff!!  My favorite sandwich is their egg salad sandwich. I also had their chicken salad sandwich recently and it's just as delicious!! My boyfriend loves their meatball sub and philly cheesesteak. Some other notable sandwiches are their Italian sandwiches (duh! makes sense!)  I've also had their gnochhi and garlic bread, yum and yum. You really can't go wrong with any of their menu items. They have a little Italian market before the register in case you're looking for something Italian specific!

Everything I've tried (which is about half the menu) is delicious, and the store is full of great Italian goods. Highly recommend the beef cheesesteak and chicken pesto sandwich!  Something to keep in mind, however, is that there is not a lot of room to eat at the restaurant, and the place is generally packed (especially around lunch), so it's often a good idea to call ahead and take your order to go.  I know others on Yelp have complained about the service, but to be honest, the service reminds me of the service I used to receive at similar places all over New Jersey, and I really don't mind it. This place is always busy, so it doesn't bother me if the staff isn't the nicest I've ever met. That said, they've also never been rude to me either. They're just busy and moving fast -- the food is amazing and very reasonably priced, so that's what matters to me at a place like Defalco's.",

And there was water on the bottom of spaghetti they didn't drain the noodles enough before serving the plate. What a disappointment to drive that far for food that we love and to be disappointed. Maybe next time but if it happens again then never again.",

I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it tasted just ok.   Lasagna was cool in the middle and my friend's dish was ice cold when she cut it in half. When she said something he offers to reheat it (in a microwave I'm guessing), not a new one that was at the correct temperature.   If you were grocery shopping here this place may get the job done, but I wouldn't make a special trip here.",

Then when we went to sit down the floor was wet all over and we ended up having to jump around to sit outside.  Apparently the bathroom overflowed per one of the employees.  It probably should have been closed.  The food was nothing special and actually below average.   I ordered one of their sandwiches and it was missing items that were supposed to be on it.  Not to mention they forgot to even make it; I had to go up and ask for them to make it.  The pizza ordered was soggy, greasy and devoid of flavor.   No napkins or silverware was provided.  Nobody bother to check on customers.  The tables were disgusting, I cleaned them myself with alcohol wipes.  In our time there, we noted two other customers who also had bad experiences.  Maybe a bad day, but still unacceptable.  Just not worth the money or time for that kind of experience.  Never again!",

Both of these items were quite good and the key for the sandwich was the sesame seed roll and of course the price was only 7 bucks for a giant 12 inch fresh sandwich. On this Sunday at 2pm it wasn't crowded, but I did call and order ahead which is still the best method for take-out.  Stuffed Shells - 8/15 - The shells are stuffed with a dense ricotta which is both creamy and filling. Five good size shells, but they failed to melt any mozzarella over the top, leaving me feeling a bit empty inside. Only 9 bucks for the meal, but cheese was a big omission in my mind.",

Short and sweet: I have had the Italian Combo, the Il Purista, the Italian Beef, the Proscuito, and Italian Sausage and Beef. Every single time I've had a sandwich here, it's been the best I've ever had. Every time!! The bread is delicious, the beefs are delicious (not over salted), and the fixings are always fresh. Their cannoli changed my life, it was so darn good. The service is always fantastic. They give me great suggestions every time I order and the food never takes more than 15 minutes to arrive (usually ten min). I absolutely love this place and consider it my favorite sandwich shop! Five out of five stars!!",

When you walk in the place looks busy with all different types of pastas and sauces you can imagine. The menu is posted on the back wall along with cold cases filled with homemade sides and fresh meats and cheeses. If you're smart, call ahead and have your order ready when you arrive because the wait can be long during peak times. I love how you can grab a beer from the cooler or a bottle of wine to share on a cute date. I haven't had the chance to buy the fresh pizza dough, but will get on that pronto! Make sure to get their stamp card (spend $5 and get a stamp) for some future savings- trust me you'll be back!",

I tried this quaint little grocery/deli while on vacation last year and, now that I am a permanent resident, I go as often as possible. I could spend all my time just admiring the imported products on their shelves and behind the counter; wine, olive oil, pastas, sauce, cured meats. But, the real treat is the food they serve. This is the best casual dining Italian restaurant you'll find in the valley. Their pastas and salads are out of this world. The sandwiches are to die for. I'm always down for \"Il Purista,\" a cold sub that includes prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, tomato, roasted peppers, e.v.o.o & balsamic vinegar. The gnocchi with Alfredo sauce can't be beat, especially with a side of marinated artichoke salad. And they have an assortment of beverages to wash it all down, including beer and wine. Just order at the counter and they'll serve you at your table. Take-out is fantastic. Catering..highly recommended. Sitting here, writing a review for Defalco's, is enough to make me want to head on over. You should do the same..you won't regret it.",

It is a Italian grocery store that also service food, sells meat products as well as selling coffees/sodas/dessert. They have dining table in between the aisles - it makes it tough to shop for things by constantly reaching or peaking over tables when customers were eating their meals. I honestly don't understand why they don't separate the shopping from dining area. It was very confusing and inconvenient for shoppers.   Service: it was decent, but staffs were doing too much and too many things. Within 2 minutes of ordering my vanilla Italian soda, he turned around and helped someone else. Once he turned back around, he completely forgot what I originally ordered. Nevertheless, staffs were friendly   Food: I ordered a Italian soda and it was almost all sodas. I couldn't even finish it. However, a group of us ordered dessert and it was delicious. Especially the Tiramisu. I purchased their ice cream here. Though it was a bit pricey, it was totally worth Every penny.

They also appear to be doing a pretty hopping business judging by the line at both the bakery and the hot food section.

It was pretty good though I wasn't in love with the roll it was on, but otherwise no complaints.

I ordered the cheese lasagna. You pay for it, take a number and wait. While waiting, let your eyes and senses shop the grocery area with all sorts of imported pastas, sauces  and other products.   You can't be in a rush with this place. About 10-12 minutes later, voila! My lasagna arrived to the table with a warm, crusty side of garlic bread. So damn good!

    "text": "YUMMY! Quality and Simplicity are what make great Italian Food, they have those two important factors down! Their sandwiches are delicious! The meats they have are par to non int the city. One of my favorite sandwiches is the 'Capacollo , Hard Salami & Provolone' on their outrageously wonderful white italian sub roll! I usually go for wheat, but I make the exception here, it is worth it!!  They are also a great Italian grocer for all your Italian, fresh pasta, pizza dough, wine, italian goods, etc... The prices are reasonable and you won't be disappointed! This is truly a little Italian gem in the desert. and very casual and low key, but delicious! I highly recommend Defalco's! P.S The wait wait can sometimes be long, but it is worth it! If you are in a hurry, CALL AHEAD!",

    "text": "I liked this place because it looked like an authentic deli that was far enough away from the trendy restaurants on Scottsdale Ave. I have to say this place is hit or miss for me due to service and food choice. I can't say everything I've gotten here was good, but I will mention what was good. I've had the \"Il Purista\" cold sandwich which includes prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, basil, tomato, roasted red peppers, extra virgin olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. Tasty sandwich, one of the best I've ever had and the bread was soft and fresh.  The calzone was also good. We had to try it because this is what the restaurant made for Guy Fieri to try on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. You can put anything in it. I think the best combination I've had was spinach, olives, and ricotta cheese. Seriously, adding ricotta makes all the difference. I had it once with regular cheese and some meats, but it was whatever. The ricotta is just a great touch. Get your calzone with ricotta. It makes a difference!  Now, it has to be said because I think rude people just don't get that their attitude makes a difference in a restaurant's atmosphere and how people feel about coming back. There is this one cashier who just has this funky attitude like he could care less about working there. I'm like, this is De Falco's! It's such a cool little restaurant and they got this dude working there who could care less. Once he messed up our order and my mom asked them to make us another calzone. Well, the cashier reluctantly put in a second order for a calzone free of charge but the order was still wrong. We didn't complain a second time because the owner/manager of the restaurant came out to apologize for the cashier and let us know everything was okay. Now, that's customer service. He made up for it really and I still think this restaurant is great despite. But it has to be said that little things make a difference.  This place is real cool though. It's a cute deli that sells Italian imported pastas, sauces, wines, etc. So unique and a little pricey but it's imported stuff.",

Price was OK, size was OK, bread was VERY good, meatballs were pretty good, sauce was MEH.  The real reason for the 2 star review, trust me I am not a hater, is that it came out cold. Not like NOT-steaming hot, not luke warm but actually cold.   It was super packed and right at lunch time, just before noon so I would have expected it to be piping hot.  I will try the Italian cold cut and may update this review to a more favorable one. For now, color me unimpressed.",

They make great antipasto salads and their chocolate covered connolis are fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about the food...Every time it is delicious!  I see a lot of people complain about the service, and honestly, they need to get over themselves. It's a smallish corner store/ deli...not a full table service restaurant. That being said, the people who work there have always been friendly and accommodating. The food does some times take a while, but it is well worth the wait...and the price!  Another word to the wise...this place is always busy, it's definitely a local spot and close to ASU so you won't be able to avoid a lunch rush if you head over after 1, so give yourself some extra time to stand in line to order and then to wait for your food.  Their grocery is pretty cool, they have quite a few things I haven't been able to get elsewhere and a HUGE selection of wine. (They offer wine selections with their food too)  This is definitely one of my favorite spots! I highly reccomend it!",

So today I stopped and ordered the meatball sandwich on an Italian hard roll....just like I would back home.  WOW!  Absolutely amazing!  While waiting for my lunch, I wandered about the grocery to see what I would come back to purchase later.  Defalco's will certainly receive some of my money in the near future.  They have a great selection of meats, wines, pasta's and deserts!  One of my favorite deserts that my mom used to make is Pitzels....and yes - they have them!    I look forward to going back to Defalco's soon....and sipping on some wine next time while I wait for my meal.  Definite 5 stars in my book!",

There is a variety of homemade pasts in the freezer. They carry imported olive oil, cheeses, and sauces. I can find everything I need to cook a traditional Italian meal just like mama used to. There are several wines to choose from to enrich the Italian dining experience. To quote The Godfather, \"leave the gun, take the cannoli\". The cannoli here is the best I've had in a very long time.  Today I picked up a bottle of garlic oil and some pasta flour. Tony was working today and we spent time talking about lasagna. He makes the lasagna here. In his enthusiasm I think he let a few family secrets slip to me, but don't worry Tony, mums the word. I can not come to Scottsdale without a trip to Defalco's.",

The last two times we ordered off of door dash and it was incorrect, called the store and the manager even admitted that he always has incorrect orders from them...shouldn't you stop dealing with them then? Or do you only care to get money without delivering on your end?? The only thing decent here are the cheesesteaks, anything else we've tried hasn't been palatable. After being a customer almost weekly here for a year I won't be returning. I've been in the industry for twelve years and Defalco's you should try having managers that actually manage instead of letting sixteen year olds run your business into the ground.",

The \"Il Purista\" is stuffed with thin-cut prosciutto, thick-cut fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers & enough basil leaves to make a large pizza. The balsamic vinegar & extra virgin olive oil complete the beauty that is served on your choice of bread. Since I'm keeping with the purist theme, I opted for the traditional Italian sub roll.   This place is oh so much more than just a phenomenal sandwich joint, it is a full-on Italian grocery & butcher shop/delicatessen. Indoor seating can be a little scarce during busy times but there is something special about sitting next to racks of cannoli shells & lady fingers.   Now, I want dessert",

You could eat here a 100 times and probably still not try everything. That also means there is something for everyone! My go to order lately has been Il Purista sandwich, which has prosciutto, mozzarella, basil, tomato, peppers, balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I order it on a french role. I only order the half size because even that is quite large. And the best part, it's a ton of food for only $7!!! All the sides are tasty; I like the artichoke hearts and assorted olives. For desserts, I love their Tiramisu ($4), and cheesecake ($4). They also serve wine and beer. It's fast casual style, where you order at a counter and they bring out your food to the table. I will warn you that sometimes there is quite a long line, and it can take awhile to order. It's casual but not always fast. But even if there is a wait, they get the food out quickly and it's worth it!",

Thank you for your review of DeFalco's.  I want to apologize about the wait time.  We have been very busy, so it does tend to take a bit longer than I would like for food to be prepared.  As a way to avoid some of the wait, you can call your order in ahead.....  We can have your order ready for you when you arrive, and we can also have that order made to dine-in if you like.  Just an idea.....  Also, in regards to the Italian dressing, we will put as much dressing on the sandwich as you desire.  I don't have any thoughts of rationing the dressing out.  We tend to prefer NOT TOO MUCH dressing on the sandwiches, as opposed to OVER-SATURATION.  The methodology behind this, is that we can't take the dressing off the sandwich, once it has been put on.  If someone doesn't want all that dressing then we would need to remake the entire sandwich.  We are more than happy to offer you extra-dressing if you ask us to put it on.  Also we will give you as many extra sides of dressing as you desire, free of charge.  I just thought it was important for you to understand why we do what we do.  I appreciate the review and I appreciate your coming to DeFalco's.  I consider all reviews to be on of my best ways of understanding what my customers want.  You have been quite helpful in this regard.    I hope you have a wonderful day, and thank you again for taking the time to let us know how you feel.  Warmest regards,  Anthony DeFalco-",

    "text": "I had a lunch meeting today and we decided to deli, but the question was Italian or kosher deli? I hadn't been to De Falco's for over a year, so it seemed to be a good day to revisit and have a sandwich on the patio. I was a fan before and I am a fan now. I had the Italian beef with peppers and onions, and my only comment is that I wish they would dunk the entire sandwich in au jus (I think it's OK to get messy to have a good time...in fact it may be required).  That's not really a complaint, mind you, just a comment. De Falco's gives you plenty of love in the form of a nice big sandwich with great ingredients, great fresh bread choices (crunchy italian roll is the best for sandwich like this). My lunch companion had the chicken parm (he had never been to De Falco's, or really an italian deli of any sort) and he was really pleased with his selection as well (in fact as we were leaving he saw one of the pizza's and said he was going to give them try for pizza this weekend, so he really was impressed). The only other italian deli/sandwich shop in Phoenix that I've tried is Luke's of Chicago (I know, not really the same, but some of the sandwiches are similar and italian beef is italian beef, so...). I think De Falco's is substantially better, and their broad selection of sandwiches, meals and other take out really gives them a leg up. Service is courteous, prompt and everything shows up at the table hot and on time.  Great place for lunch, and take out italian!",

    "text": "They had a large selection of cheeses and meats which was rather impressive though I was at work so didn't get the opportunity to purchase or try them. There was also an amazing selection of pastas to purchase, a lot of them were made in Italy and organic! A decent selection of Italian wines as well. I met for lunch! Such a great selection it took me a few minutes to decide. What I really liked about them is that they have half and whole portions and the sandwiches are properly priced!! The wait wasn't long either. The blackberry jasmine iced tea I had was amazing!!! I ordered the Italian beef with the peppers and onions. The peppers were soft but very flavorful. The onions didn't have as much flavor and were a little overdone for my taste. The meat was great but sliced a bit too much for me (but each place does things differently) and there could have been a bit more on the sandwich. The au ju was great but not quite hot enough. Overall I will definitely be back to try other sandwiches, I just wasn't as thoroughly impressed as I expected.",

Just a heads up...because the food is so good...they can tend to have a long line and you may wait for your food for a while.  They even have a sign up that states if you have don't have 15 mins to spare to wait for your food...you may not to make other lunch arrangements.....and it is True. My advice..... If you're in a rush, call in, they will take phone orders.",

This place, unfortunately, is right next to the dive shop we have been visiting regularly... which means I fortunately get to have an excuse to drive from Gilbert and devour anything made by Defalcos that I can think of.   We have been here numerous times as I used to live nearby for college and it was a favorite among the four of us who lived together. Plus, I don't think anyone has ever been disappointed with what they ordered. There is a wide variety of Italian options on the menu and everything appears to be fresh made in house and served up hot and delicious. My favorites have been the chicken pesto pizza (the larger the better), the lasagna, and anything desert.   Everything you order is HUGE plus it comes with garlic bread, a salad, really it's the whole Italian works.   Really... you will not be disappointed here with what you order. This place is also like an Italian market so they have all sorts of pastas, sauce, oils, desserts, everything Italian that you can buy and take home to make on your own.   JUST. DO. IT! You may be sad afterwards... but it's only cause you realized you couldn't help yourself from eating way to much delicious food.",

Several co-workers recommended the cheesecake for dessert and other salads. So the next time I got a chance to grab lunch in the area I dropped in. It happened to be during Spring Training season so it was crowded but I got a couple of the premade salads to go. My fav is the tuna pasta salad.  Luckily it was too crowded for me to  check out all the options in the pastry case so I ordered the plain cheese cake and a cannoli to go. Both desserts knocked my socks off. And I have been back for both.   This wonderful establishment is close to my work so I plan to keep dropping in for cheesecake and cannoli fixes when I have my moments of weakness. But its oh so good, and smells delicious as you are waiting for your food.  Support local family owned businesses!!",

We tried the pizza bianca with pepperoni and sausage, the beef and sausage sandwich with au jus, the tortellini cold salad, the pasta shell cold salad, the build your own calzone, the meat ravioli with red sauce, the chicken caesar cold pasta salad, and the chefs salad. you name it we got it and we left with a bag of groceries! Seriously this joint was down home Italian food. It was jam packed both times we went so that should tell you something. The prices were very reasonable as well. This is a must on any trip to Scottsdale! Can't wait come back and eat here on our next visit!",

    "text": "I love when restaurants come with an international grocery store. Their novelty pastas, olives, and wines make great gifts for everyone! Their eye-catching items are fun to browse through as you make your way to the counter to order.   I've been here a couple of times, and am still navigating through what is good and what isn't.  The good: The service here is lovely. Everyone is patient and friendly, and food comes out fast.  The penne alla vodka is by far the best item on their menu! Made with a creamy tomato-vodka sauce, the penne alla vodka will give you a warm feeling in your stomach. Get the whole portion and be prepared for leftovers. I also enjoyed the baked ziti, and I hope you like cheeze, because the baked ziti is drowning in cheese. It's very similar to the penne dish, but baked and with an added layer of cheese. mmm.   The okay: The chicken parmigiana with spaghetti was alright. The spaghetti was a little cold, and you needed to ask for extra marinara sauce if you wanted to get the spaghetti to taste better. I  also think the garlic bread is way too crunchy on its own. As a dipping tool for your sauces, it's great, but doesn't hold well on its own.   And while I love the isles full of grocery items, the store can feel cramped at times, especially during busy hours. Whenever I sit by the wine, I'm always afraid I'm going to turn and knock everything down!",

Thanks to one of Guy Fieri's lists of tasty dives, we found DeFalco's and could not have been happier with the food. It had a delicatessen flair with an Italian menu, which was a little unsettling at first. Our family of five also had a hard time finding a table large enough to seat us all together, even at 9pm! Our spaghetti, salad, pasta, and pizza sub were devoured in mere minutes, and our whole crew left happy and fulfilled. 4 stars because of seating issues and because those desserts were just prettier than they tasted. Overall, however, this is a great place!",

They have a full menu at the deli including pastas,calzones,soup,salad and dessert.The seating is cozy and while it may not be a full blown restaurant the food is a must try.  My personal favourites are the cold and hot sandwiches/subs. Portions are generous pricing is reasonable i like that you can get half portions.The wait is sometimes a little on the higher side but totally worth it.  Cheers!",

An awkward cook stated the computer system had crashed. The chicken Parm sandwich was dry on the bottom with only sauce on top. It had good flavor but i would definitely try something else next time.",

    "text": "Defalco's Italian Grocery 2334 N Scottsdale Rd Scottsdale, AZ 85257  Defalco's reminds me of many Italian deli's in New York. Racks of Italian foods that are often hard to find, and a long line to get waited on.  The sandwiches are food of the Gods. Well stuffed with premium ingredients, some are so big that they consist of more food than many third world countries eat in a month! Their hot sandwiches evoke wonderful memories of sandwiches eaten many years ago in New York, and the wonderful aromas made my stomach rumble in anticipation of the food it was soon to receive.  If you find that a sandwich is too much to eat, you can get a half sandwich for a few dollars less. Several selections on the menu are vegetarian, including an excellent eggplant parmigiana and an outstanding grilled portobello mushroom sandwich with goat cheese.  For those from back east, they serve a terrific sausage, pepper and onion sandwich which will bring back memories of places long gone. They also have sausage and meatball sandwiches that i was hard pressed to try and finish. However, leave room for dessert. Traditional Cannelloni,  Cheesecake, Tiramisu, Napoleons - all wonderful. Of course, its even better with a cup of cappuccino or espresso or a latte to help wash it all down.  Lest I forget, they also have a selection of calzones as well as pizza's and pasta's.  They stock a wonderful assortment of Italian food stuffs ranging from olive oils to boxed pastas along with an excellent wine section. In addition, Defalco's produces some of it's own pastas as well as it's own homemade sausages.  While there is not an abundance of tables, you can eat on the premises if you wish. Defalco's is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. so you can eat lunch or dinner there. Be prepared for portions that are large - in fact many of them could easily be split between 2 people.  To be honest, nothing about Defalco's is cheap, but then again, you are getting premium ingredients in large quantities for that premium price.  Other than it is hard to find parking and the sometimes a long line one has to wait in to get service I can't really find anything to complain about. Good food, good service worth waiting for, and good attitudes all add up to a solid 4 star rating.",

We were also recommended by the hospital staff at Scottsdale HonorHealth.   They were definitely not kidding when they said that you would be eating in between rows of Italian grocery shelves! I thought we were in the wrong place at first. Again, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat because the menu was pretty expansive, but settled on my usual calzones whenever I try out new Italian restaurants. The calzone comes in two sizes, 10\" or 16\", and you can either choose your own toppings or buy their calzone concoction. You choose your toppings (or stuffings) from the pizza toppings which are like $1.50 each. My total which a drink ended up being about $17... Holy crap! But there is a big reason why it was so much, IT WAS HUGE!! I ended up just eating half of it and taking the rest back to the hotel for lunch tomorrow. The calzone was good, but not really something I would crave. I think I'd like to come back for another meal on the menu because it was not too terrible of a place.",

This time I got warm bread with cool ingredients speaking to the freshness of everything they do.  The deserts were all perfect and I think our group downed six bottles of wine while there.  Great prices on wine in case you have not looked.  We had a 2010 Zepaltas La Cruz Vineyard Pinot Noir, Sonoma Coast that knocked my socks off.  Damn good wine!!!!  The Linguine with white clam is killer as are anything with their meatballs.  In the deli case is a home made sausage rolled like a spiral that has parsley and cheese that has to be the best stuff on earth.  If you have not tried it just do it with some good bread they sell there and you will be in love!  I've known Tony for a long time now and must say he and his wife are some of the sweetest people.  It is great to see a family owned and operated restaurant do so well and keep/improve their quality over time.  It's places like this that keep food alive and well in America and keep the massive restaurant corporations away from ever receiving a dime of my money.    I've been in the back kitchen and the place is spotless.  Everything they do they do well and they are a solid Yelp 5-star joint.  I just wish he would open a Gilbert store in DT Gilbert.  Would be a perfect place for that location!",

I walked up to the counter and am relieved that the guy I dealt with the first time was not taking my order. After the long day I had had at work, I was not prepared to deal with him! The guy who took my order was very friendly and I was shocked as I was asked what type of bread I'd like. That question was not asked of me over the phone for the first visit.   J's sandwich - Whole cheese steak with everything  My sandwich (went for something different this time) - Half eggplant parmesan   Once again, the sandwiches were AWESOME! The bread was nice and soft. So soft in fact that the sandwich was falling apart on J. But he enjoyed every bite. He said for next time, he's going for just a half sandwich. But, I'm sure DeFalco's leftovers are just as delicious!  DeFalco's redeemed themselves!  :D",

I know what you're thinking, \"Why would I go to an Italian restaurant for a Cheesesteak?\" But let me tell you, you will not be disappointed, it is probably the greatest thing ever. They make their own sausage in store too which is delicious! Don't be boring and just order the spaghetti and meatballs, they're good but they pale in comparison to the other options on the menu! It's located in a super cute Italian market, if you're bringing a large party you can push tables together, but I'd recommend getting there a bit early to make sure you can grab the tables!",

So, on an expedition to get more raw chocolate, we went.  The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the racks of Italian foodstuffs. I loved that. The place screamed \"Boston\" from the moment we walked in the door. When we ordered, Jim found one of my favorite types of soda in the case, Doc Brown's diet black cherry. I was in heaven.  So we got our number and sat down. While we were waiting - a short wait - I got a brilliant idea which solved a long-vexing problem. Guess it was the east coast vibe.  The food came and I was in heaven. We split a steak sandwich and red potato salad. Jim likes everything and I just like onions so they gave him the mushrooms and peppers on the side. Lots of mushrooms and peppers. It didn't look like a ton of food but we certainly got enough to eat.  What's not to like at Defalco's? The food is fabulous, the prices are good, the people are really nice, and they have all kinds of imported goodies. So I guess the only thing I didn't like about Defalco's was leaving.",

The cashier refused to make more of the soup of the day. After waiting 10-15 minutes to hear the news, he offered a dinner salad. The salad was not fresh and the lettuce was unsatisfactory, after waiting an additional 10 minutes. I went up to the counter and spoke to the owner. He offered to give me another salad, which at that point I didn't want to wait any longer. He finally gave me cash back, after giving me some of the worst customer service experience I've received at any restaurant in Arizona.  The worst part is that he would NOT listen to me when I told him the lettuce tasted stale and out of date. He outright denied my claim. I have not received such an attitude toward a customer before. He had no reason to give me a snarky, self-righteous attitude. He acted completely full of himself and his restaurant, saying that it was fresh and I was wrong. It's not that hard to please the customer. I will not return and can't recommend this restaurant based on their refusal to put the customer first. I'm pretty sure I know how a fresh salad should taste and this was not up to par. Not a big deal, don't attack the customer. That's unacceptable. There are a number of Italian restaurants I frequent in Tempe and Scottsdale and will go to them in the future. Defalco's inability to give a welcoming and positive experience is not well received and will not be tolerated.",

It's usually ready in about fifteen minutes and you get to skip the line (as pickups are a separate cashier).  The cheesesteaks are phenomenally sinful, whether you go with the beef or the chicken. I try to eat healthily, but even I will admit weakness when faced with Defalco's. I'd like to see you resist once you have tasted their heavenly precursor to a heart attack, err, cheesesteak.  Also, don't skip dessert. The cannoli is epic.  If you want to eat in, there are tables along the windows. The grocery also has a good selection of Italian dry goods if you want to do something crazy like cook at home.",

So the food is made fresh to order, and with that some things take more time than others to get.. but isn't that a good problem to have? The only actual problem I see is that when someone comes in super excited with really big hopes because Defalco's has such a great rating they tend to get disappointed by the little things that usually wouldn't disappoint them... because their expecting the best food ever.. but its not the best ever. Now dont get me wrong I can literally eat there every day and always be happy and stuffed, but your always gonna have a better pasta at a pasta place or pizza at a pizza place.

    "text": "This was my second time this week to experience DeFalco's. To say I was underwhelmed both times would be an understatement.  The first time was when we ordered pizza for friends that were coming over for the evening. Our friends were excited because DeFalco's was a place they had heard really great things about and couldn't wait to try their food. the pizza though was just so-so. The sausage and pepperoni one was better than the vegetarian one because the meat added some flavor to the whole thing but the veggie one was bland. No one was impressed...  My dad has been going here for years though and he said their sandwiches are what they are famous for so I forgave the sub-par pizza and tonight we decided to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm sorry that we did...  1. I don't have a problem with surly restaurant employees... I was a surly barista for years but I have a problem with rude asshole workers. My husband and I walked up to the counter and this guy turns and complains to his co-worker about all the people coming in. Really dude??? People buying food here is what keeps you employed! He then bitches again about the same thing as I am attempting to order. AND he won't even acknowledge that I am the one ordering and will only make eye contact with my husband. Like I wasn't there.   2. My husband ordered the Greek Veggie Sandwich. We got home with the sandwich and as he was checking it out he notices that it has only one piece of feta on the whole 12 inch sandwich. And one cherry tomato on each sandwich half. The rest of it is just cucumber and onions. That's it. So he was essentially given a cucumber sandwich. Lame.  3. My dad and I split a whole Combo sandwich. It was okay. Not great. I've had better sub sandwiches.  My dad says that the sandwiches were not like he remembered in the past and that this time they really seemed to skimp on the meat. In the past he and his girlfriend had split the same sandwich and it was almost too much for them both. That was not the case tonight.   The only positive thing I have to say is that one of the people with us got a tuna sandwich and they said it was really great. She also thinks Top Ramon is good though so take her review as you wish.  Sorry to say that I don't think I will visiting this establishment again. And my friends that wanted to try the sandwiches... I'll be encouraging them not to bother.",

    "text": "Don't understand the fuss about this place.  The first time I went I got a Caprese Salad.  It was a giant bowl of romaine and iceberg lettuce (I expected a handful or none at all), whole basil leaves (not tasty in a salad), pinkish/greenish Roma tomatoes (yuck), fresh mozzarella (the only plus) and when I said I wanted balsamic for my dressing, that exactly what I got.  Balsamic vinegar.  No oil.  So weird.  The breadsticks had been warmed and cooled so many times they were like semi-chewy rubber.  And cold (again) when given to me.  I left totally confused.    Decided to try again because a friend swore he loved it.  I got the eggplant parmesan over linguini.  It was very good!  But again, cold, chewy, old breadsticks. The side salad had the same pinkish/green Roma tomatoes (who EATS those horrible things!!???)  My friend (who talked me into going back again) got a chicken parmesan sandwich which was served on old bread that was so hard he couldn't bite thru parts of it.  He was very disappointed.    I will say this: the tiramisu was the best I have ever had.  Great cannoli too.    But seriously: its really hard to take an italian place seriously when they serve terrible, old bread and can't tell the difference between the worst tomatoes ever and a good or even great, juicy, enjoyable red tomato.    Na mean?",

    "text": "Usually when I read all these great reviews, my dreams, hopes, mouth, tummy, appetite and foodgasm get crushed with disappointment. I came here for the cheesesteak. Don't call it a Philly cheesesteak like I did. The sandwich comes plain with meat and cheese, but upon request they will add grilled peppers onions and mushrooms. Just the right amount too, unlike other places that will try to use the veggies as fillers. I ordered two full sized sandwiches for my wifey and I, waited ten minutes, drove home and looked at them for a while....they didn't look anything special.  First bite OH MAN! Kaching, Jackpot, WOOT WOOT. SIrens and Alarms went off! I have never been to Philly to try an OPS (kinda like OG, but stands for Original Philly Cheesesteak) and I have no desire to go to Philly either. If I ever have the urge for a great cheesesteak, good bye Corleone's and shitty US Airways Center overpriced soggy bread with morsels of imitation meat and cold hardened cheese, I will come to Defalco's. It helps having a close place by though.  PS: You can make two meals out of one sandwich unless your a fatzo like me or starving. Call ahead and just pick it up if you don't want to wait ten minutes, or plan on not eating here. I'm a big D man (work and live in Dallas/live in Scottsdale), wore my Dallas Mavericks shirt and the guy wanted to charge me twice for that. The line for ordering is in the back, don't stand around for five minutes at the front line where people order coffee and other hot beverages.",

The food was outstanding and so were the people working there. I ordered the meat raviolis which came with a side salad & garlic bread, everything was delicious!!! My husband ordered a sausage sandwich and loved it as well. The environment was great, staff was willling to answer any questions, overall I loved this spot!   Also the strawberry swirl cheesecake was exceptional, I wish I had ordered another slice and a sandwich to go.",

You're basically eating among the aisles of a small grocery shop, which is pretty awesome. Service is prompt and friendly, the food is very fresh. Can't wait to come back.",

I was super excited to come to \"my favorite authentic Italian deli\" .... and I was a bit disappointed.  The front counter person was extremely rude and dismissive while I was trying to order .... and they were not even busy!  I'm not sure if it was an \"off day\", but I'm assuming not after reading other reviews with similar complaints of customer service! It's quite sad, really, as they used to be super pleasant.  I was trying to eek out a score of 4 (down a star for bad customer service), but then I got my food.  The wait was not long but, unfortunately, my Italian combo sandwich was not as awesome as it was in the past! It was lacking in flavor, as well as the pasta salad I ordered on the side.  .... so I have to dock another star! .... should have docked two stars, but didn't want to leave DeFalco's with a 2-Star rating .   The grocery store portion/selection of food to purchase and prepare at home is awesome (there... there is 1 star back!). It was very clean and well organized.   DEFALCO'S .... train your staff to be more pleasant (at least the counter people who \"greet\" you .... geesh .... and people MAY get over the slip in taste.   Booooooo, I probably won't \"intentionally\" be back during future visits to Phoenix!",

We each looked at the menu and decided on a couple of pizzas and pasta dishes to share at the table.  Two of us went to the counter to order the food.  Not long after we placed our order, they delivered the food to our table.  The pizzas were great - one Blanca and one traditional red sauce.  Each entree came with a nice small salad that we shared between 2 people. I really enjoyed the linguine with clam sauce and the gnocchi with pesto.  Service is a combination of self-service (get your own soft drinks/water) and full-service (delivery of food to your table).  Defalco's is a winner in my book - quick, reasonable prices, and great food.",

There are plenty of imported grocery goods that can be bought, including fresh made pizza dough ready to be turned into homemade pizzas, and buffalo mozzarella in their fridges.   Their sandwiches both hot or cold are delicious. You pick the bread for the sandwiches, the focaccia or the sub roll are my favorite options. Spaghetti and meatballs, jumbo stuffed shells, and their roasted artichoke and vegetable lasagna are all fantastic. Calzones and pizzas can't be beat, and their dessert selection is pretty tasty too. The Baklava is among the best I've had, as well as the cannoli.   Definitely worth stopping by for lunch or dinner, one of my favorite places.",

From its set up to the amount of hoagies offered. I have to say the chicken parm was probably the best I've ever had! They have several options of rolls you can choose from which is pretty cool.

To finish it off- you have to have a piece of cheesecake- the best, most creamy goodness ! These are always mine and my hubby's go to!  We stopped in the other night for dinner- I got gnocchi in marinara sauce which came as an entree with a side salad and garlic bread.

There's also a deli counter with a tantalizing selection of cured meats and cheeses.   I had the meatball sub with a side of eggplant artichoke salad. You order at the counter and receive a number to take back to your table. It only took a few minutes for our food to arrive and it looked amazing! The meatball sub was a hearty concoction of tender, well seasoned meatballs smothered in an appetizing tomato sauce and the bread we chose (Wheat) was nice and toasty, holding up well to all the sauce and meat. The eggplant salad was a vinegary mixture of breaded eggplant, large chunks of artichoke, olives, carrots and peppers. To me it skewed too acidic taste-wise but the portion size was good.   There is a fridge with various drinks available, including different delicious varieties of San Pellegrino fruit sodas, as well as an iced tea station and soda fountain.   There's a lot of prepackaged and jarred Italian food available for sale as well, such as pasta, tomato sauce, and risotto rice.  Seating was plentiful on a Friday late afternoon with tables both inside and outside on their patio.  If there's only one word to describe DeFalco's it's DeLicious!",

The place is always busy, plan on standing in line for a minimum of 10-15 before getting to the register. Word of advice- know exactly what you want when you get up there.   Between their classic desserts and large selection of food, you won't leave hungry. The portions are huge, but amazingly delicious. I started with dessert, as the responsible adult I am.   Carrot cake, tiramisu, black and white cookies, lemon bars or Italian wedding cookies. You won't be disappointed.  If you order a sandwich on a baguette, be prepared to take home 1/2 the sandwich. The bread is the perfect combination of crunchy, chewy and soft. All at the same time.   They also have a great selection of wine, meats, cheese and other legit Italian food products.   Enjoy the sunshine on the patio and wear comfy pants, that stretch..",

(If you call in your order, if not expect a decent wait) Today I was on my lunch break and for a turkey provolone and a chocolate cannoli! For 8 dollars for a huge sandwich I don't know why you would choose anywhere else! So glad to have found such an awesome Italian deli nearby, have not been to another one in az yet that has reminded me of the food I had in Italy.... definitely recommend if you love Italian food! Would also highly recommend the arancini especially if you have never had it anywhere before! I had it the last time I was here and it is sooo good! Very few place in the valley have arancini let alone this good!",

In recent years, restaurants have found a way to pre-cook spaghetti without it getting watery. The spaghetti I had here was watery. I ordered a large serving and got what I felt was a small serving of pasta with a large serving of sauce. It was served with garlic bread that was not crispy because they pre-cook it and wrap it in aluminum foil. The salad was decent. I would've ordered the spaghetti with clam sauce, but they told me they don't make it there. Not impressed. Perhaps I need to sample their deli meat to appreciate the place.",

Bad- While I was there three customers came up to complain about not receiving their coffee orders.  Place was extremely hot, dirty and cluttered with random products from Italy.  Display cases were disgusting.   Food-  Chicken parm sub I threw out.  Chicken was cut into strips, wasn't breaded and was rubbery.  Sauce was so salt it clogged my throat.  Bread was the only good thing.  Probably because I love seeded rolls.  Despite being hungry, I starved.  Cannoli was soggy and wasn't fresh.   I couldn't help but think that this is a place that became popular after DDD and then they stopped giving a rats ass.  There is no honor in serving people food you wouldn't serve to your Family.",

IT SURPASSES any deli I've been to in AZ. Fantastic quality, NEVER a bad dish. I can pick anything on the menu and I am completely confident it will turn out perfect. We've now been in the area for 3 years and anytime we want to have a special dinner for pick-up to eat at home we think: DE FALCO'S. Lunch time is very busy (which is a  good sign when looking for good food!) so I suggest ordering for pickup if you're on a lunch break. But if you're out and about and are eating-in, its WORTH the wait! The grocery is also amazing. Tons of yummy imports. I very highly recommend De Falco's!",

    "text": "I didn't post this review last week and was scrolling through my phone, saw the picture and remembered I still needed to write a review. So here it goes...   Last week's lunch adventure was going to eat at DeFalco's in Scottsdale (fancy), actually when you walk in it really isn't that fancy.  It is a real authentic deli with a line out the door and people running out with food calling out names. We went around lunchtime so of course it was packed.  I ordered the spinach and cheese arancini (riceballs) and it was so good. It was the size of a baseball nestled in marinara sauce. It was perfectly fried and moist inside. I could not eat the whole thing, I had maybe 4 more bites left but I could feel the heart burn coming- it was my fault for not taking an acid reducer prior to going.     Apparently the food networks Guy Fieri was here filming diners, drive ins and dives so it has to be good right? The people are very friendly and service is quick even though they warn you it will take a while.  Once a table has cleared of customers, someone is out to clean it up within moments so they are always clean.  Did I mention it is grocery store too?  You can buy gelato, different types of cheeses, bread and noodles in every single shape and size. Another plus, they have wine AND you can buy their premade pizza dough for $1.99 that is a steal in my opinion.  I would love to come back and have some more food. But it would be wise to come alittle bit before the lunch rush.",

The seating situation here can get dicey, especially around lunchtime.  There's not too many tables/seats inside and while there are a few located on the patio outside, it can get real hot there during the Summer months.  Overall, it's a great Sammie and I always look forward to dining here.  Return Factor - 87%",

I came here last night because I was on this side of town, and it brought back a few memories of years past when I first moved here.  For starters, this place is cute, and has a lot going for them.  Set up as part grocery, part restaurant, its in a strip mall on Scottsdale road near Thomas.  Hours are great, and menu is large with great pricing.  I love a good menu! You can basically get just about anything you want done your way here, and the food is pretty good.  For starters, the wait was a bit longer then I had anticipated, and I thought it would have moved a lot quicker considering I was here at 8:30 on a Wednesday night. There was hardly anyone in here!  I thought it was just an off night, but after reading other reviews, I guess their a little slow on service.  I don't mean to sound impatient, but the wait did seem long and I was quite hungry.  Secondly, the grocery store was well stocked, but some of the shelving seemed a bit tired. I was sitting there waiting for my food and noticed that some of the shelves with heavier cans on them were starting to buckle and warp.  Maybe it's time to upgrade?  Nothing is perfect, but it kind of made me feel tired after I sat there staring off at random things in the place while waiting for my food.  On a more positive note, the food is delicious!  You can get anything you want made up any way you like.  I went with a half tuna sandwich and I couldn't finish the darned thing!  Great awesome pricing with a large menu and a great concept here.  Also, while I was here waiting, I overheard a customer talking with one of the staff members. I guess Guy Fieri stopped in here recently for Diners, drive ins and dives.  I also saw a huge poster of him on the wall by the customer pick up area.  10,000 bonus points for that!!!  Overall, place is great, but I feel like they need to move a little quicker in the back with food preparation, and work on stepping up some of the grocery shelves to make it look less tired.  Great product selection not only in the grocery area, but menu as well.  Definitely worthwhile, just don't expect your food to quickly and be prepared to wait a bit...",

She was really short, and for 3 people who were first time customers, she left a sour taste, and she forgot my moms black and white cookie. Also the soda machine was all out of syrup. But the store itself is wonderful, and the food was great. I would have given 5 if she wasnt so rude.",

My girlfriend and I have been treated poorly as a couple and as individuals.  Every time I come here I am treated poorly by the staff.  So much that we usually get our food to go, just to minimize contact with the staff.  Even with this strategy the older man at the to-go register is a giant Jerk.    Every.  Single.  Time.  I've spoken with the owner, he was very nice and said he would correct his staff and even picked up our lunch.  That was super nice of him.  I believed it would all be handled.  Next time we came in, no owner, same rude service.  So for the fourth time after our chat Mr DeFalco the service remains...hostile and rude.  I'm sorry Mr DeFalco but your restaurant is officially dead to me.  And I'll be sure to tell all my friends.",

The prices really are too high for a lot of the items, but that would be more acceptable if the whole experience were good. I can't give it a higher rating because the service is terrible (and I have been there a few times). It is not that the people are not nice, it is just so unorganized. And if you want more than one thing (like fresh sausage and then a sandwich), you will have to wait in TWO lines. If they could simply organize the flow of the service, I believe many more people would find the experience of going there better.",

    "text": "Il Purista Sandwich and small centurion calzone  You could not ask for a better Italian deli in a major city like Scottsdale, AZ . When you step inside, you forget your in the dessert. Industrial racks stacked with pasta and canned tomatoes provide a cozy atmosphere that provide both a isle for the ordering line and dine -in area for patrons. We arrived just after 11 am on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded at first. As you walk in you are warmly greeted and ushered through the ordering line. On your right you can order up a fresh cup of espresso or imported Italian beer. If you make your way to the left you come to the ordering counter where everything on the menu is displayed on the back wall. They have a glass case with fresh pasta, mozzarella, and cured meats on display.  I immediately checked on Yelp to see what others had ordered and one in particular caught my eye (J P.) Great recommendation!  Il Purista is a classic Italian Sandwich with your choice of Italian bread, fresh mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, and a generous portion of prosciutto. I wasn't blown away, but it did meet my standard of fresh ingredients and taste.  The Centurion calzone was amazing! I'm a big pizza fan and this one had the WOW factor, served on a pizza pan with a side of marinara sauce with chunks of meatballs. The crust was perfectly baked, crispy on the outside with just the right amount of chewiness inside. Italian salami, mushrooms, peppers, and basil combined into a very warm and savory pocket of goodness.  Recommendations: Definitely try the calzones, Pepsi fans will be extra delighted that the soda fountain is extra sweet. I actually refilled my small drink 3 times. Next time I might try some of there fresh pasta's.",

Ive had a few of the dishes and some are excellent whereas others are average.  Stuffed Shells, pretty good but made differently each time it seems, sometimes they're more open face and melted or titled to the side with crumbly cheese in them. I prefer closed and stiffer shells myself.  Mac n Cheese, all the rage in the reviews but I can't see why. Penne with melted cheese on the bottom. Some of the top pasta was dry with no cheese. I could melt a cheese blend in a pot and pour it over pasta myself. Making a spice blend or crumbly baked mac in cheese is more effort so I'd pay someone to do that. I'll eat it but won't order again.  Meatball Sandwich, very decent, big, saucy.  Pizza, decent, would order from time to time.  Quaint (but very small and busy) eating area. Great alcohol selection but I couldn't find much merlot next to the wine. Great deli and for picking up your own ingredients.",

There are so many options, including salads, beer or wine (by bottle or glass) and deserts There are tables scattered inside or on the patio with misters to beat the heat. They sell Italian groceries, meats, gelato, uncooked or precooked pasta, wine, cookies, sauces. It is usually busy and the staff is friendly. A fun place for a meal and easy to spend time browsing. I never leave empty handed.",

The steak was dry even in the melted cheese I was so disappointed it was a waist of a trip.on a side note my wife had a sandwich she liked and the pizza looked good I just had a very bad cheese steak.",

It came out larger than expected but the red sauce is so savory and delicious. I also got a side salad that was very fresh. As I ate looking at everyone else's food, it all looked delicious. I wish I had more days in town to try everything on their menu. I also went back another day just for their desserts, they have so many options!",

Keep in mind I went at 11:00 so as to not to bother people on a work schedule going to lunch. The selection was poor to start with, and most of the choices were boar's head brand which I can purchase less expensively at a grocery store. The counter person was rude and seemed to be bothered that he was helping me. When I inquired about Italian sausage, I was told they were out. Sorry, 11:00 in the morning and they're out of Italian sausage??? Sausage is a basic product that any Italian deli should not be out of on a work day. This has to be the worst experience I've had in a deli. I would like to have tired their lunch selection sometime, but based on how badly I was treated, I won't go back.",

I've noticed that all the products they have are really authentic imported from Italy, and I think I'll buy some of the products for some Christmas presents. We'll definitely come back!

I meat and cheese available at the deli counter is exquisite. The staff is always friendly and often hilarious!",

    "text": "I moved to this part of town a month ago, I'm from NY and Italian. I was so happy when I first walked into Delfalcos and could smell the sause, cheese and garlic. They even sell pizza dough for my stombolli! I haven't seen a real Italian style deli since I left NY 14 years ago so I was thrilled. Their calzone was great.  So far I have been there 3 times, I have also ordered their hero sandwiches, the bread is great.  Unfortunately on a recent Friday night I had the worst service, bad enough to keep me away. Since I know that the wait is long once you place your order, I have yet to wait less than a 1/2 hour, I called my order in and was told it would be ready in 45 minutes. I ordered a calzone and meatball parm hero. I arrived 45 minutes later. My meatball hero was ready but the calzone was not.  I don't think they ever started it. After waiting another 1/2 hour A \"gentleman\" came to the register to present the bill and tell me it would be another 5 minutes or so, I asked if the sandwich that had been sitting on the counter the entire time was mine, he said yes.  I was not happy with the prospect of my meatballs and cheese sitting there to get cold while I waited for my calzone, so I asked if he was going to give me a fresh sandwich, If looks could kill...I was subjected to the rudest of service from that point forward.  A customer next to me commented \"good for you\" he said he never gets good service there but the food is good. At no time did the \"gentleman\" apologize or seem to care if I was satisfied. A real detriment to any business in this economy is someone who represents your business so poorly.  Maybe I will return, some day....",

Being new to DeFalcos, I wasn't real sure how to order cheese and salami from the deli - we didn't want a sandwich made. We stood around trying to catch the eye of the two men behind the deli counter and finally had to interrupt him as he finished with a customer.  Without a word, or even looking at me, he flicked his thumb towards the back of the room. We decided he wasn't that interested in our money and left. Great food is important, but customer service - not letting a (potentially) good customer get away - is just as important.",

I usually order ahead and either eat it there or take it to go as during lunch they get very busy and you usually end up waiting for your food for quite awhile. The prices are soooo good and they make everything fresh. Check out their deli counter with their fresh salads. Love the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil sandwich. I get my sandwiches on their sub roll. When I ate meat I'd get the same sub but add prosciutto. Drizzle EVOO and balsamic vinegar and you are ready to get your grub on. Oh yum, their Chicken Parmigiana sandwich is a large amount of tender chicken in their homemade red sauce covered in melted mozzarella...what's not to like about that? Their pastas and stuffed pastas are fabulous; eggplant parmigiana and stuffed shells are great! The pasta dishes come with a side salad and garlic bread. This has a comfortable family feel and it's always fun eating here, I would definitely recommend it!",

A tiny little establishment inundated with products and heck they were even able to squeeze a couple of table in there for dining. The shelves are lined with numerous imported products from Italy, and not just pasta was a relief to see. Canned tomatoes, pasta, gnocchi, candy, cookies, etc.  Although I have not tried too many items on their menu, I have not had a single complaint about anything I have tasted.  The only thing that is missing is the smell.  I used to go to a place in Franklin, MA called \"Ferraras\".  Their original place was there for generations, and for generations it has had meats hanging, fresh meat being butchered, and the women in the back cooking up a storm.  You just walked in and were immediately hit with the aroma of 100 years of delicious treats.  Although Defalco's does not have that yet, I'm sure over time it will get to that level.",

The baguette was crunchy, doughy and plain old great. Big Fan.  The wife had the capacolla, hard salami and provolone on sub roll and it was awesome too. She wanted a little extra Italian dressing but they were quick to oblige.   Next time, will try their supposed \"best cheese steak sandwich\" Will surely make the 20 minute trip there again !

You can shop for what you want to take home while you wait to get in viewing distance of the on-the-wall menu board. The line moved quickly and once we placed our order, I think our food was at the table within 15 minutes. We ordered full portions of ziti and chicken parmesan because we wanted leftovers. Both came with amazingly tasty seasoned garlic bread and a refreshing side salad. We could've easily gotten away with half-portions, but now we have dinner for the next few days.  The ziti had a marinara/cheese/cream sauce, so yummy, and the chicken parmesan was a full-on tomato sauce that perfectly complimented the chicken which was easily eaten with only a fork. We had to stop well before we'd eaten half our entrees to share a chocolate shell canoli, which was out of this world. I think I'm going back next weekend. The only drawback is that all your food comes out at once: salad, bread, entree, dessert. But it's a small price to pay for perfect.",

I had them put together an antipasto tray (pasta salad, marinated artichokes and mushrooms, olives and pepperoncinis) and an \"italian style\" (pepperoni, capacollo, genoa salami, provolone & muenster cheese), plus some of their rolls that they were nice enough to slice into smaller portions.  To say the amount of food on each tray was abundant would be a huge understatement.  They were literally overflowing and needed two of us to carry each of them.  Unfortunately, the plastic trays they used couldn't handle all that weight, so the lids wouldn't stay on and we had to very carefully move them so they didn't collapse. There must've been 10 pounds of bread.   Every single item on all the trays was of the highest quality.  You could tell the trays were made fresh that day.  The bread was amazing - soft on the inside and just chewy enough on the outside.  Too bad they don't have a fork-free dessert option, because I would have loaded up on that too.  Everyone ate more than they intended and we got lots of oohs and aahs.  Best part of it all is that there were enough leftovers for us to enjoy for several days!",

    "text": "As Dean Martin sang, \"That's Amore\", thats exactly how I feel about this place! I just tried it for the first time after seeing reviews on Yelp. I absolutely loved it, I tried the cheese steak and got a side of the tortellini salad. I'm not gonna lie, I havent ever tried a cheese steak sandwich until I went here and I have fallen in love. I went with my parents, and my fiance and we were each in heaven. My cheese steak had everything on it, and it was so yummy. I was worried the bread would be too hard, so it would be hard for me to eat.. but my worries went away as soon I bit into my sandwich. It was the perfect hardness (wow that sounds a bit scandalous), not too hard but not too soft.  The tortellini salad was good, but I wouldnt say great.. next time I'll have to try a different salad. My mom whose had many cheese steaks in her life, swears this is the best she's ever had anywhere. My dad would not stop raving about his meatball sub. My fiance got the 5 meat sandwich, and really enjoyed it as well. In my family we are big dessert eaters, so of course we each had to get our own desserts. In our group we had the canoli, caramel fudge cheesecake, carrot cake, and the taramisu. Each and every one of our desserts was so good! I will definitely be back here, to top it all off the service was great and our food came out pretty quickly. My mom had a bit of a shopping spree in the grocer section, so I knew she was very pleased with this place. If you're in the area, you will definitely need to check this place out. I will write an updated review after I've tried the pastas.",

Since I have been going here, the place has continued to grow into greatness. The cured meats, Fresh olives and the array of Pasta and cold Salads are sensational. Did I mention the wine selection. I am not so up on wines but the owner Tony is more than happy to help me or my friends out. I also like to use this place on anything Italian I may cook because not only is it good for Deli they have a market of Italian items to cook with. Clean Deli, Clean Bathrooms, old school Ambiance, Fresh Fresh Fresh and the sillyness of the staff make it a fun experience. This alone and the fact no other deli compares, I give them 5 outta five stars.. ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! Keep it up!!! and Ill keep coming back!!",

And the staff (other than the new guy that's now bringing out the food) don't seem to really care about the customers.   They hide behind the excuse that \"good food takes time\" but the hard reality is that they are just ultra inefficient and truly don't care to speed things up.

    "text": "Based on high Yelp reviews and recommendations  from others finally decided to try this place. After waiting in line 15 minutes I ordered the Italian Combo to go.  Waited another 15 min for them to prepare and off I went.  Omg this thing was the same horrible sub you'd get at a Subway or Jersey Mikes franchise!    To start, what they call \"toasted\" is just warmed up.  The sub roll had the same yellow grains on the bottom that cheap pizza chains use to prevent their genius cooks from burning the crust. It's actually corn meal and should never be used on bread since it's disgusting.   The puny amount of meat used on their sub was laughable. I asked for Italian dressing and they must have barely put on a teaspoon.  Ok I know I should've just tossed this thing out the window but hated the idea of wasting 10 bucks. Took my first bite and it was so dry I nearly choked on it. That was enough for me, into the trash it went along with the zero-flavor, dried out  brownie I ordered.  No way I can recommend this place for sub sandwiches or deserts.  Perhaps the pasta is good but not taking my chances.  The only reason I can give 1 star is that their to-go napkins are nice and high quality (thank goodness too, I needed something strong and absorbent to hold the sub and brownie that I spewed  out).  Ciao DeFalco's!",

Cheese Ravioli was a little on the dry side but tasted good.  A waiter told us their sandwiches are the best. Will go back to try their grilled veggie sandwich.. You can find a wide range of balsamic vinegars, pastas, Italian seasonings and lot more. Looks like it will save me a trip to the other continent in future.",

From back when they were on Thomas road , my sons grew up on their meatball subs.  Now they enjoy the pizzas and pasta choices(lots to choose from or customized) With the great selection in their market it is like stepping through the doors into Italy itself.",

    "text": "Had to check out DeFalco's after seeing all the popularity on Food Network shows and such. Now I drag everyone I know here first chance I get.  FOOD: Some of the best Italian sandwiches I've ever had outside of New York City. My favorites that I never stray from: Chicken Parm Sandwich on Foccacia Bread (the Foccacia is perfect for this sandwich, trust me) and their Calzone. I have to mention that I'm not a big fan of Calzones, but this Calzone is life changing. No, seriously. The dough is always perfectly cooked and the cheese is overflowing but also not too much to handle, it's in balance with the dough and whatever toppings you put inside. Their Centurion Calzone is mind blowing. And, if you think it's expensive, just know that a small Calzone is huge and worth at least two meals unless you haven't eaten all day. If you get the larger Calzone, prepare for 4+ meals out of it. Last but not least, their marinara sauce they give for dipping is a one-of-a-kind family recipe and straight up, I'm not kidding, I will drink it straight from the cup they give you. I've done it before and I'll do it again, but only after I pour it all over where it truly belongs in harmony with the dough and cheese.  SERVER: They bring your food out to your table with your number, but no real server here. They'll bring anything condiment-wise or silverware that you need if you ask, though. Neither good nor bad, average.  HOSTING: No hosting, just order in line like a deli shop.  AMBIANCE: Casual, comfortable deli-like atmosphere. Sometimes I feel like the staff could be a bit friendlier, but meh.  The food here has always been of amazing quality and consistency and absolutely delicious. Come here as soon as you can.",

I had a half grilled veggie sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. The sandwich was very tasty; bread was perfectly toasted, veggies were cooked and seasoned well, and it had the proper amount of cheese. But the star of my meal was the mac and cheese. I tried to eat it slowly to savor every last bite. Easily the best mac and cheese that I've ever tasted. The one drawback was between waiting in line and waiting for the food it was a long lunch, but the food was well worth it. Fantastic.",

If you are in a hurry, the food can take a little while during the lunch rush, so take advantage of calling ahead of ordering so it will be ready when you get there.  In addition to the great food, they have deli items for sale, specialty pasta, bread, wine, etc. Everything you need to be a hero in the kitchen.   The one thing that's a bit odd are the signs on the soda fountain admonishing people not to steal soda, if they have a free water cup. That seems more like a sign you'd see in a Circle K in a shitty area- not a great deli. Maybe they can lose the sign, it kinda isn't in keeping with the classy feel of the food, ambiance and people.",

Now it's not a philly cheese steak in the sense of finely shredded beef, but you can taste it's the real deal.   We also got a half order of lasagna and it was delicious as well!   And a side of artichoke salad which was yummy as well.  Getting a cannoli to go and some imported wine.  We'd get more but no cooler with an 8hr drive home.

    "text": "This was my family's 1st stop of our Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food Arizona self-guided tour.  Defalco's was featured on Guy Fieri's DDD and they're an Italian food/sandwich/deli joint.  Why was this our first stop instead of the multitude of Food Network or Travel Channel foodie destinations located in Phoenix and Scottsdale?  Our family was here in Phoenix for my daughter's 4-day volleyball tournament and the wifey wanted her to carbo load to get her ready for some spiking and blocking.  I AM SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY DEFALCO'S WAS OUR FIRST STOP!!!!!!!!!  I got a little frustrated trying to find Defalco's because we got lost trying to find it.  As we were driving down Scottsdale Road looking for the address 2334 Scottsdale Road, my GPS directed us to where it should have been, but the numbers skipped.  Just continue driving North because the numbers will resume again.  Defalco's is located on North Scottsdale Road not South.  Just make it easier to find this foodie haven because others have to try this must eat at destination.  Defalco's is an Italian market combination deli.  The seating area and overall look gives off a Mom and Pop, hole in the wall vibe, which was a great sign of what was to come.  Triple D locales usually are annointed with Guy Fieri's mug plastered somewhere in the restaurant.  There was a framed picture of him as well as a spray painted picture of his signature spiky hair and beard.  Both signifying Guy's stamp of approval of a must visit establishment.  Defalco's had shelves of Italian food products to purchase and it's a full service deli that sells delectable meats and sausages.  Interesting tidbit:  I spoke to one of the employees and asked him if his business spiked after the DDD episode.  He said it definitely opened the floodgates, but Defalco's initially rejected DDD's desire to feature them on the show.  He said they were popular already and didn't need DDD, but a customer wrote the show and was adamant about DDD featuring Defalco's.  DDD's producers were persistent and kept calling them, so Defalco's relented and man, my entire family is soooooo glad they did.  I asked the kind gentleman behind the counter what Defalco's was known for and he said that they had the best cheesesteaks in the nation.  Wow, that's a bold statement and made me skeptical.  He also said their pastas, pizzas, and salads were can't misses too.  I ordered of course the half cheesesteak sandwich, small pizza with Italian sausage and pepperoni, large penne meatball pasta, and a vegetable pasta salad.  Everything is made to order, so you'll wait a little while for the food.  The wait is worth it.  I got my half cheesesteak sandwich filled with a piled amount of tender, thinly sliced rib eyed steak mixed with melted cheese and caramelized, juicy fried peppers, onions and mushrooms inside a soft bread roll. When I took my very first bite of the half sandwich that was more than enough, OMG OMG OMG, I was speechless.  As I savored this first bite, my family laughed at me because as I tried to vocalize how scrumptious this heavenly collection of meaty, cheesy, vegetably, and bready goodness, I mumbled something that wasn't discernable.  That good!!!  I didn't have to eat anything else because this sandwich alone was 10-star rating worthy.  Order a pizza.  Any pizza.  The small is good enough to feed a family of four.  The crust was tasty and had a good texture.  If I wasn't so full from my sandwich, I would have eaten more than the 3 slices I ate.  The pasta salad had good tasting dressing and the pasta had a huge, nicely seasoned meatball.  Defalco's had a good assortment of desserts.  I tried my wifey's chocolate covered cannoli and wow, I need to try more of their desserts next time.  Get the cheesesteak sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Mr Fieri, I thank you for featuring Defalco's and Defalco's, I thank you for your cheesesteak sandwich.  I've been a little unlucky when it comes to my best foods ever.  Best buffet and burger in Las Vegas, best burger in Los Angeles, and now best cheesesteak in Phoenix.  6 hours to drive for a cheesesteak?  So worth it.",

It can get crowded at times, but don't let that deter you, it moves quickly. I usually get the Meatball sandwich on a hard roll....it's magnificent.",

I am a huge fan of Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches, even though I am from the west, and I talked to one of my other foodie friends on where the best one in town is. They said DeFalcos for sure. Since I was in the area I decided to give it a try. Now, I tend to lean more towards a Cheez Whiz Philly over a provolone Philly, but I may have to rethink that decision after trying this one. Everything about this sandwich was great, from the first bite to the last, every bite was the perfect blend of meat, cheese, bread, and peppers. I am glad I ordered a whole because I would have been very sad if I just got a half.  As for the establishment, I have heard there can be very long waits, but I must have been lucky. I was able to walk right in and order. They had a very nice beer selection as well. As well, if you need anything authentic to make a home cooked italian meal, this is definitely the place where you can find it.  I will be back very soon!!",

The restaurant meals are cheap for what you get and word is out among the ASU students and young families. Pizza crust was chewy, crispy with just the right amount of char, like a good bread. Cannoli was outstanding, obviously had been freshly filled, as shell was perfectly crunchy and the sweet ricotta center had a nice clean flavor. Lows: Pasta and disorganization.  It was a packed Saturday night and they weren't prepared. The wine glasses and forks ran out. They had a weird ordering system where there were two cash registers, one halfway through the line. When one of the staff would become available they would open the halfway register, which meant that someone who was lucky enough to be there at that moment would get to order early, in effect cutting in front of the rest of us who had been waiting longer. Our ravioli and filled shells came out lukewarm. As Yogi Berra once said, \"Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.\"",

I take family here whenever they visit, and everyone keeps talking about it for weeks.  Definitely my favorite Italian spot in the valley.

I honestly don't understand how Defalco's is not bursting at the seams every time I visit. The place is NOT your typical Italian restaurant. All food is cooked fresh while you wait. The market is always well stocked and reasonably priced.  The wine selection is SOLID, too, with a diverse range in type and price.  Defalco's remains some of the best pizza I've had the pleasure of consuming in AZ and even though I'm NOT a \"sweets guy\", their cheesecake is my #1 favorite EVER. Always MORE than adequate servings for the price on all fronts.  If you haven't been to Defalco's, you need to go visit them STAT! Seriously, Defalco's is a total cultural experience you don't want to miss. So find a couple of hours in your week, then go and order in - it's the best way. (But don't forget a bottle of wine on the way out!)  Thank you, Defalco's, for being so consistently awesome! See you again real soon.  :)",

The food is top-notch--we take all of our out-of-town friends/family here and they are ecstatic.  Meatballs are phenomenal and salads are out of this world.  Their \"imported from NY\" cheesecakes make you want to cry with joy.  I have never eaten a better cannoli--and that's no lie.  I have read the complaints about service, but it's a deli--not a full-serve restaurant.  I find their food and offerings on-par with New York.  I would actually say their service is better than NY--maybe a bit of attitude here (if you want to bring one as well) but not even CLOSE to something you'd find in Brooklyn or Queens.  We've tried a lot of Italian places here in the Valley and this is our top pick.  If you don't go there expecting royal treatment you will be nothing but happy!",

I have been going here for years and it took me a while to find what I think they do best and what I don't. Here is my ratings on each dish.  Philly cheese steak on hard bread with everything 5/5 - best I've ever tried so far chicken fettuccine with garlic bread 5/5 -  olive garden is one of my favs but this tops it in areas calzones - 2/5 pretty large but terrible side salads 2/5 bland cafeteria quality Italian sausage with peppers- 2/5 too large of ingredients throw off the taste prosciutto - 5/5 some of the best tasting meat I have had pizza - i cant recall it so I wont rate it turkey w/ provolone 3/5  So the line may be long or seating short depending on timing. It isn't the easiest to get a take out box if you decide after to take it with you. And it isn't the most beautiful place to sit down in with all the groceries around but damned if they don't have some killer food.",

I guess it is the Italian mentality where nothing should be rushed but it was a little long!  I always come back because it is delicious and so worth the wait!  The staff is friendly.

It's a great little authentic Italian deli with an incredibly great selection of foods behind the deli counters and a great selection of other Italian foods out and about the deli.  Not only do they have THE BEST cheese steak in AZ, all of their food rocks, at least all that I have and that has been almost everything on their menu.  I usually go with friends and we...I order for us, 2 whole sandwiches so we can do half and half.  The last round was the cheese steak and hot Italian sausage!  YUMMMMMMMMMMM!  By the way, their cannoli's are the BEST, not filled until ordered so the shell is nice and crunchy.  Gotta go, I'm hungry!!",

    "text": "Very disappointed for my first and last time coming here. The Spanish gentleman who took my order for 3 Philly cheesesteaks could not comprehend what cheese wiz was and just kept saying American. Then he took \"everything with provolone\" as a cheesesteak with all of their cheeses on it, lol. So after a 5 min long ordering process for 3 philly cheesesteaks speaking like a child to this guy due to his lack of english skills he finally got it right. I'm born and raised in Philadelphia so I know how to order a cheesesteak. As I sat and waited for my order, another gentleman came in and walked to the take out pick up counter in the front and asked the tall, thin, around 55 or so man working (he said he was one of the managers) if he could order one Philly cheesesteak, and the counter guy just pointed at the back and said \"you can't get a Philly cheesesteak but you can get a Phoenix cheesesteak.\" The guy trying to order was all confused and said I guess and proceeded to the back as the guy working the counter continued to say that he didn't want their sandwiches affiliated with Philadelphia cause its a horrible place with horrible people. So I kind of laughed and asked, wow, did you have a negative experience there or something. And he just said its a horrible place to go, and he feels bad for people who live in that \"hell hole.\" At this point I was getting offended and said hey man not all parts of Philly are bad, I'm born and raised there as well as my whole family and we turned out ok and love where we are from. He then told me I didn't know what I was talking about and that he wasn't changing his mind because it was the truth. I then realized his ignorant personality was not going to at least be open and talk like a normal person, so I called him an ignorant \"you know what\" and laughed at him for how bitter he was and said he should try shutting his mouth with his ignorant opinions openly in a deli that attracts many east coasters, perhaps others from Philly as well or others with family from that area. Thankfully, I did not think the cheesesteak was that good at all! Corleone's is much better for a cheesesteak so if your trying to get the authentic experience for a True Philly Cheesesteak, don't go here where they apparently hate Philadelphians anyways... There is no excuse for ignorant management. Not even an apology from his narrow minded self because he said out loud in front of a few people that everyone has the right to their own opinions. Now his opinions and sub par at best cheesesteaks are a reason I will trash talk this place to everyone I associate with here in the valley.",

It is a rare find to get awesome food, a comfortable environment and excellent service at a reasonable price all rolled into one. The homemade sausage is excellent, the pizza is perfect, the choice of deli meats is extensive and homemade side salads (red potato dill is my favorite) and everything on the menu is fantastic. I have read that people say the wait is long, (which I find unfounded) but when you are considering what you are getting, the wait means nothing. I have waited longer for Sysco reheated food in a restaraunt (bleh) and had worse service. I would take a 10 min longer wait for really good, fresh food any day. If you can't appreciate that then maybe chain restaurants is where you should stay. We really do our best to stay away from those and finding places like Defalco's is really tough. We will continue to be loyal customers and spread the word of one our favorite places to eat. Don't pass the opportunity to try this place!!",

A few minutes passed, people walked in and out of the kitchen, the other guy was still doing a long order.  I passed the time by checking out my phone.  Another customer got behind me in the deli line.  He also pulled out his phone after a couple of minutes as well.  We were both just hanging out when he strikes up a conversation.  I was surprised to hear an older guy with a heavy accent quoting a line from Ferris Bueller so I give him props for that.  We fiinished our chat, the meal line was on to the next customer, workers were coming in and out, stocking shelves, Another person got behind us in the deli line.

Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated recently bought a car at one of the McDowell dealerships, and was bringing it in for service. I met him there, and we went off in search of food. Happily, he was in the mood for a sandwich (and a beer!), so he was agreeable to checking out Defalco's.  I loved my sandwich! Fresh, chewy bread, flavorful sausage and red sauce - it was a comfort food happy place for me! My dining partner was not quite as thrilled - while the flavor of his cheesesteak was spot on, we both felt the texture was too mushy.  We did have fun checking out the grocery products - and have some inspirations for meals to make together in the future. So we'll be back - for shopping and a sandwich!",

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. When I asked the cashier what he thought would be good, he said to me \"you can throw a dart on the board and be happy\" and he wasn't kidding.  After you're done eating, pick something up from the deli to take home for dinner. Ricotta, Mozzarella, Salami, Pizza Dough, Tomato Sauce, Raviolis, you name it, they probably have it.

The sandwiches are usually very good and they have killer focaccia bread.  I would definitely call in your order to go instead of eating in.  When we were ordering at the counter it was hard to communicate with the guy at the register because the other employees were asking him questions in spanish and interrupting.  Not sure why they couldn't wait till he wasn't in the middle of taking an order. I wound up getting mustard on my egg sale sandwich somehow because of it and it wasn't as good as usual. The food also seems to come out in a random order I got an egg salad sandwich and my friend got a ham deli sandwich and he got his about 15 minutes before I did.  The times I have gotten takeout from here it has gone much better so I'll just stick with that.  Try  - focaccia bread on any sandwich - egg salad",

    "text": "I grew up in Scottsdale and would come into Defalco's from time to time and always LOVED it (I even remember when they were at there old location). I moved from AZ a little over a year and a half ago and in the months leading up to the move I found myself eating there more and more. It's one of the few restaurants in AZ I truly miss. Anyways, I was recently in AZ visiting for about eight days and I ate here THREE times during that span.   For as often as I've eaten here over the years I've only tried about 4 or 5 things on the menu (why fix what ain't broken). The four-meat sandwich is AWESOME as is the Italian sausage sandwich. Get a whole, and you have a meal for now, and one for later. On my recent visit these are the two things I had (yep, I did the four-meat sandwich twice). Other dishes I can remember trying over the years are the antipasti, which is loaded with goodies as well as the ravioli, which are delicious (usually I'm not a fan of the sauce at little takeout Italian places like this, but Defalco's sauce is very good).   In the past I've gotten takeout, but on this last trip I ate there all three times (there's not a ton of seating, but it seems like most people get takeout). It takes a little while to get your food (if you're not eating there I'd call in your order), but you can't rush good food :) For the quality and portion size the prices here are very reasonable.   I'm not much of a cook, so I've never really taken advantage of the \"market.\" However, there seems to be a lot of items you won't find in the supermarket, so I'm sure if you like to cook Italian food and are looking for specialty items, this might be the place for you.",

Yeah I know, penalizing them for not \"healthy\" is probably silly as you know when going to let's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good. That being said the food at Defalco's is very high quality - almost as if you are in Italy and am not comparing it to fast food.  I suggest you wait to try out Defalco's when not in a rush as its worth the wait. There order system is very similar to local places back east (basically avoiding technology) and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food. I am from back east (NY area) and finding a good Italian deli / grocery store in the Phoenix area is not an easy task. A friend introduced me to Defalco's and anytime I am headed south on Scottsdale road (which is often) and after passing Thomas my stomach seems to pick up we are near Defalco's as it starts giving me the rumble noise.  I have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Parmigiana, and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot. I recommend to bring a friend and each get a different large sandwich and share.",

I meant to ask for a side of mayo and was about to when I took a bite.  Didn't need it.  Awesome amazing flavor.  The au jus soaked into the bread that was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside.  Very good food and a great experience.  We will definitely be back.",

Defalco's meatball sub forces me to break my pattern. It's so good I've never tried anything else here! Last Valentine's day, we celebrated the weekend before and on our way to our outside-of-town date activities, we stopped by Defalco's for meatball subs! Red meat, cheese and tomato sauce spells romance for me apparently.   You can eat-in amid the grocery shelves, but we generally take it to-go.",

I saw pictures online of rice balls in the case under the counter where all prepared food is but there were none so I asked for one. They said they had them in the back. I said I wanted it \"to go\" & I waited and waited. I finally asked if perhaps they were heating it up because it wasnt necessary to do so. I was told it was \"frozen\" & they popped it in the oven. Wha? Frozen? Why not fresh? Why make rice balls & freeze them? Turn off. I didnt find the guy behind the counter to be too friendly either. Another worker was irritating because he sat in the corner eating and staring at me to the point of being so blatently rude my husband felt the need to block his view. C'mon, get it together.",

The atmosphere is wonderful inside- an open deli with an Italian style market on the floor, and a nice little patio outside.  The owner was personally running the cash register, which I respect because I love when owners show enough care to be working any job necessary.  We were greeted warmly and the owner talked to us for ten minutes or so while ordering and after.  When our food arrived it was nothing short of life changing.  We got a spinach salad with chicken and goat cheese that had a nice and tangy Dijon vin dressing which was delightful, a bowl of minestrone soup, and an antipasto salad.  All ingredients used in the salads were fresh, and you could definitely tell!  Overall this place is an amazing experience.  From food to customer service to atmosphere, this is already a new favorite of mine, and I will definitely be returning very soon!  Side note, I read Paul B.'s review and I have to say, we must have eaten at different places.  The owner was anything but rude, and just a heads up, bacon and PANCETTA are definitely not the same thing.  For complaining about the quality of Italian food you sure don't seem to know anything about it.",

What deserves five stars is the service level of the guy who took my order.  Good job.  He gave me a sample of the seafood salad even though it had to be a pain in the N-U-Tz to do so.  He was fine with my disaster of an ordering job, too.  It was all good.  I got a veggie sandwich with avocado, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, and italian dressing.  sprouts maybe.  It was mediocre.  Really average.  I know you may tell me that they're an italian grocery! they shouldn't have amazing veggie subs! but I think that's crap, personally.  Anyway, I'm not saying it's horrible, I'm just saying it isn't 5-star quality.  Dallas.  Anyway, a guy I work with said we should go there and he immediately qualified his approval of the place by saying it was overrated--to his credit, because it is--and it was decent.  If I were the type to have a real italian sandwich then I'm sure it would be good.  But I *am* the type to have a cannoli and the cannoli was crap, when measured against the Grimaldi's-cannoli yardstick.  I would go so far as to say don't order it there--go down the street to grimaldi's and get it there.  I might go there again.  I'm not saying it's abysmal.  But temper your expectations, that's all.",

    "text": "I really enjoy DeFalco's because of its unique atmosphere and the exceptional, authentic Italian food.    DeFalco's is a family-owned Italian deli and market.  The restaurant is divided by racks of wine, imported pasta and a large inventory of desserts and treats. After ordering at the back of the restaurant by the meat and cheese cases you're free to choose a table; no matter where you choose to sit, that spot in the house becomes your own private restaurant.  Yes, it does take a little bit longer to receive your meal but this is because they take the time to make every dish to order (the sign on the door even indicates this). Whatever you order comes out in its glorious perfection.  And, you get some extra time to stroll around the store as your mind wanders; so many items to choose from, so many meal ideas!    My dinner companion and I split a Caprese salad, a full order of Gnocci with Alfredo and red sauces on the side, an Italian sandwich, and a chocolate cannoli for dessert.   The Caprese: the tomatoes were perfectly ripe, the mozzarella was exquisite (and it was a generous portion!), and the basil was refreshing.  The salad came with a side of olive oil--this olive oil was some of the best I've ever had--and balsamic vinegar.    The Gnocci was incredibly light and slightly chewy; again, another incredibly delicious dish!  The side of red sauce and Alfredo were perfect--I like to go back and forth between dipping in each of them to create sort of a Vodka sauce.  The Alfredo was rich and had a strong garlic flavor, something very unique and quite addicting.    We had to try an Italian sub; after all, the huge list of sandwiches, both hot and cold, was practically calling our names.  The bread had just the right amount of crunch, but it was also chewy and soft in the inside.  I was going to hold myself back from eating the entire thing, but I couldn't.  So damn good.    AND the cannoli!  We chose the chocolate covered variety.  The cream had just the right density and ratio of chocolate chips.  The shell itself was crisp and the chocolate added just enough richness to the dessert.  Incredible.    Anthony DeFalco came to our table to see how we enjoyed our meal, which really completed the whole experience.  He's incredibly passionate about his family's restaurant and explained how they never cut corners on quality ingredients.  We asked about the amazing olive oil that accompanied our Caprese salad, and he went to the back to bring out a bottle wrapped in gold foil.  I only wish I knew where to buy this exceptionally light and pure oil, but then again, that is DeFalco's secret.",

He didn't have a ton to add to the contrary about his sandwich, which was also middle-of-the-road. He sang the praised for the cheese steak sandwich however and the pizza pictures look phenomenal.  I personally would have ordered the calzone but the base was 6 something with an additional $2 for each topping.  With the two sandwiches and drinks I believe the total was around 15-17 dollars. I would go back to try something else, but I wouldn't go here specifically for a meatball sandwich.  Their call-ahead service was helpful as the line was fairly long by the time we got there. The food was ready and the service was prompt. I would suggest this if you are in a hurry for lunch.",

And holy crap, I think I have a new favorite place to eat lunch.  The first visit, we asked the guy at the register what would be good for a first-timer to try, and he said the Philly Cheese Steak is the best in AZ.  So I had that, and I don't know if it's better than a Corleone's cheese steak, but it was definitely good, and certainly priced much better.  Visit #2, I went with a half plate of the meat lasagna.  Delicious.  The sauce is flavorful, and the half plate, which comes with a side of garlic toast, is more than enough food.    Visit #3, I had the half chicken parmigiana sandwich and a slice of new york cheesecake.  The sandwich was saucy, cheesy, and all around great.  The cheesecake was probably a B+... Not quite what you get at, say, the Carnegie Deli, but nothing to scoff at.  There is all kinds of other crap on the menu that will bring you back for many visits.  A colleague had Il Purista sandwich, with homemade mozzarella, panscetta, among other things.  The counter is rife with delicious looking salads and desserts, and there are countless sandwiches and pastas.  There is even pizza, which I haven't even delved into yet.  The best part is the price.  You can generally get out of there with a $10 or so lunch, and considering the quality of the food, it's a very good price.  I could eat here every day.",

Defalco's was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!    First off, it's not just a deli, it's an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  It's also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now we've moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Don't forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.    My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  I'm a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  It's always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads I've had in a long time.  It certainly won't take me another four years to go back.  I think I've been there just about every week in the last month!",

I finally got over it months later and gave you a try, and I'm glad I did. Your \"vegetarian\" sandwich wasn't just lettuce, mayo and cheese. It was overflowing with yummy veggies like carrots, onions and avocado and tasty italian dressing. The wheat roll was crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Unfortunately some peppers from another area in the deli case made their way into my fruit salad, and my lemon bar tasted bland and bitter. Other than that, I'm glad I gave you another chance and I will surely be back again. Maybe pizza and a more authentic italian desert next time.  Kind regards,  Molly",

Add delicious cannolis, fast service, and a huge menu, and you've got a recipe for awesome.",

It may be hard getting a seat as this place is pretty small, though I lucked out and had my sub outdoors on their patio.  My italian sub was very tasty, though it lacked the italian dressing promised on the menu. Since the service isn't waitered, and the line was so long, I didn't try to get up to ask for the sub to be fixed.  I'll go back there again, but don't expect great service or a slow meal. It's for folks in a rush who need to get something and run out. Call in ahead and pick it up later if you can -- that's a separate line",

We shared a meatball and a sausage sandwich and I can't decide which one I like better. And the price...So reasonable. Our bill for the 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks was just under $20. What a price! and we had more food than we could eat. The deli section looks amazing and I can't wait to get some meats for home from here soon. They have a fantastic selection of products. We had to go back and get cannoli's for later and we just had them tonight and they were some of the best I have had and the most reasonable. Another place has some very similar and charges double the price they charged. I am very impressed with this place and am just sad it took me so long to get here and try it. I already have stuff picked out to try on my next trip!",

So stringy, and had the right combo of oils on it.  The pepperoni was the thin real Italian kind - all AMAZING.  They had a cute little market with good wine, and I found some canned clams that are hard for me to find.  I also bought some imported Italian pizza sauce for my next homemade pizza. The calzone took about 15 minutes, but the wait was worth it!",

I hate judging a restaurant off only one meal because one experience is not always that telling. However, every time I got to Defalcos I thoroughly enjoy my meal and my dessert.  Their meatball sandwich will have you licking your fingers and you plate! Down to the bread they use, this sandwich is awesome. What I like most about this deli is just how fresh the food taste as well as authentic. Beyond the meatball sandwich their calzones, and eggplant lasagna are great. On the dessert menu you MUST try their cannoli and their baklava.    Location: On the outside they do not look like much at all, but as you go in Defalcos has a fun ambiance. It very much reminds me of the New York style deli and grocery. There is not much seating but if you can snag a seat I definitely recommend staying awhile because their dessert is just as awesome as their food.  Staff: The staff is primarily Italian (so you know its good) and are very friendly.",

And reason so, making no compromises on quality and remembering to treat everyone like a friend of the family is one of the very reasons to frequent this business.  The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, the selection at the deli and small grocery section is ample, the service is with a smile.  Here are a few more reasons you should go here:  ~Large selection of dried pastas, imported food from Europe, and a selection of canned San Marzano tomatoes. ~Make a quick stop on the way home to pick up a tasty bakery treat and a cappuccino. ~Call ahead and order a pizza for takeout or calzone to fill your belly. ~Stop at the deli and pick up some fresh sliced Boar's Head meats & cheeses or some freshly made antipasti, green salad or even ravioli.  You can even take a moment and eat in the restaurant or on the patio. As others have mentioned here, there're many wonderful things on the menu, but I will have to agree that the Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich is absolutely wonderful and perhaps one of the best you will find; as is the Sausage Sandwich and Meatball.

There is a bit of chaos in the ordering and food delivery process simply because so much of the space is taken up by the tables scattered in amongst the store shelves.   The food is delicious, the portions huge, the prices reasonable.  Just a warning for people that \"eat with their eyes\" first. My last visit I ordered a chicken philly cheese steak which had to be one of the more revolting looking things that I have eaten in a very long while. The chicken is ground, not in chunks, and when mixed with the mushrooms, cheese, peppers and onions resembles either vomit or dog food. Good thing I have a strong constitution and it tasted nothing like the aforementioned.",

Upon recently moving to AZ, I didn't have much hope to be able to find quality, authentic Italian food. Defalcos totally proved me wrong and beyond.  The place was/is in the process of construction so it was a little confusing when we first visited, nonetheless, a very nice place. It's a little restaurant with a little market attached which adds a very casual vibe - which I appreciate.  The food knocked my socks off. For the price and quality ingredients you can taste in just one bite, this place is totally worth a try. If you're ever in the Scottsdale area, make an excuse to stop by. You won't be disappointed.",

The chicken in the Alfredo is breaded. Even though that is not my preference and I wasn't expecting it, it was still some of the best Alfredo that I've ever had. In fact, the only restaurant that has an Alfredo that is worth going out for(since carussos in Gilbert closed down years and years ago, which had the best Chilean sea bass, that I've ever had, but that's a whole other story... miss them but feeling hopeful since finding this place). They put Parmesan cheese on the caeser salad, which makes the cheese factor farther than my preference but for you parm lovers, you have that to look forward to.  The dessert shelves look phenomenal but we are awfully full... so glad to have a new favorite Italian place. It's harder to do than I thought it would be so I'm super excited.   Update: Already went back. So delicious. We tried the lasagne with meat sauce. Perfect balance of cheese and meattp sauce and noodles. And their tiramisu is moist and light. If you love food, do yourself a favor and go check this place out.",

Defalco's Italian Grocery is a cafe with salads, pizza, sandwiches (hot and cold), pasta, and soups that are made to order. They have a delicious pastry cold case with lemon bars, cannolis, and various Italian desserts. Biscottis are made fresh daily and so is their mozzarella. The seating is limited so it's not the best place for group meet ups but there is more room on the back patio.   After travelling throughout Italy, there are certain staple products that I love and, hooray, they are here. Whether it be cheeses, meats, packaged pasta, canned tomatoes, almond syrup etc, you're sure to come across some great finds. It's a small store - it actually looks like it could be in Italy with their use of all available space - but definitely worth a trip.   Imported beer and beverages available too!",

You can literally feel yourself aging while you stand helplessly waiting for your food.  It's not uncommon to wait a good 20 - 30 minutes.  Also a negative - Price.  I'm guessing they probably do have all of their ingredients flown in from Italy, because the price reflects it.  I guess you do get what you pay for.  Typically you'll spend $10 for a sandwich, $3-$5 on sides and $2-$3 for your drink.  The happy hour prices seem okay ($2 beer).  Seating is extremely limited.  Barely any room to even move around in here.  Also, your table is so close to the other tables that people are participating in your conversation.  Kinda creepy!  The outdoor seating is basically lawn-chair, patio furniture.   And Location/Parking.  Not the best, especially with the crazy road construction.  But I guess in the end...  It is what it is.

It is my favorite deli in the Phoenix metro area.  Anyone that moves here from a place with good delis (like say... New York or Philly) will be sold after the first trip.  It's not dirt cheap, but high quality food is worth the moderate price.  If you're wondering what to expect, imagine this: a mafia informant got relocated to Arizona. His wife was feeling lonely so he brought his father-in-law over from the Old Country to keep her happy.  Being a cranky old codger, the pater familia became annoyed at the lack of quality delis in the Phoenix sea of chain restaurants.  So he started a little place where he could get good pasta, good sandwiches, and quality groceries when he wanted Mama to make some stuff at home.  And it's staffed by people who all speak english clearly... even if they have a mexican accent.  The service can be a little slow, but it's worth the wait if you've got 20-30 minutes to spare.  I don't have any kids, but I would gladly give up someone else's first-born for one of their \"il purista\" sandwiches.",

The alfredo is very rich and tasty. You can taste all the different ingredients in it. The garlic, the cheese, the cream. It's not the Olive Garden. It's legit!   The marinara wasn't overly tangy or tomatoey. It was just right!  The Caprese Salad was perfect as well! The mozzarella danced on our palates and the tomatoes were divine. I would've liked a little bit more basil, but maybe that's something I can ask for next time :)  The portions are VERY generous. We were unable to finish the Gnocchi. You'll see why in a second.  Regarding my past review...The staff was much friendlier this time around. I am VERY happy that I gave these guys a second chance. Maybe I caught someone on a bad day. Things happen.   Although there was a wait, we ordered before a few people because we were deciding on what to order. That's ok.  It was worth the wait. Take in the atmosphere, look around the store. Relax. Have a conversation with the person you are with. You'll forget about the wait. Don't be in a rush.  Also this time around, I was able to speak to Anthony DeFalco the owner, and talk to him about my first experience. He is a VERY nice guy, and very passionate about the business. My advice to any Yelper or customer who has ever had an experience that is out of the ordinary (most of the reviews are very positive), come in and tell him and he will make sure the staff fixes the problem for next time.  I should also mention that he saw me, and recognized me, and made sure that my table had a sandwich in addition to our meal that my dinner companion and I shared. It was PERFECT. Bread heavenly with a crispy crust, just enough mayo and mustard, delicious cheese, and tasty meats.   I am a fan.  He then explained to me about his selection of ingredients, breads, olive oils etc. You can see the passion he brings to work each day. It's pretty cool. I don't usually update reviews from bad experiences, but this is one I am very glad I did.  Great job Anthony and the staff at DeFalco's!  P.S. We took the chocolate cannoli home. And it was epic.",

Much of the staff has been there for many years and are friendly.  I have watched them grow from their original tiny location on Thomas and 42nd St. to the Thomas and 68th St. to their present location.  Yes the present location could be larger but that has happened every time they have moved and found more fans to crowd their dining areas.  I go there every time I am in the neighborhood.",

Served on a bed of romaine lettuce / tomatoes.  We also ordered a side of meatballs.  Amazing!  Just like my Nana used to make.  They held together well, but were still tender and full of flavor.  The red sauce was delicious.  Rich with flavor...   Casual environment, you order at the counter and they deliver your food to your table.  They also have a small store area where you can buy top of the line pasta noodles, tomato sauce, wines etc... Wonderful deli with delicious food!",

The earthy notes of garlic and onion with a little sweetness of fresh tomatoes simmering made me swoon as soon as I entered.   The guy behind the counter was full of recommendations and super nice. I also loved being able to walk around and see all the different imported groceries. I have not had a bad experience at Defalco's.   I think I've ordered everything on the pasta side and have thoroughly enjoyed everything.  If I'm taking out my niece and nephews, this is one of my go to spots because I trust the service and quality of food, plus we can binge on the sweets after.  The sandwiches are also very good. They stay together well and have a good balance of flavors, plus the bread isn't overwhelming, nor does it fall apart.  I have not tried the pizzas or calzones but the last time I was in, I caught a glimpse of one and believe I will have to make that my next target when I visit again.",

Having grown up in NY/NJ I can attest that the quality and experience of Defalco's food and atmosphere makes me feel like I'm back home. The cheesesteak is my guilty pleasure as well as the pizza, desserts, gelato, chicken alfredo and chicken parm sandwich. I have read some of the previous reviews about the customer service being perceived as rude, and I could not disagree anymore with those remarks. Sometimes it gets really busy here since it is a very popular spot with many regulars, so keep in mind the lines can get long and this I have observed is when non-regulars get all antsy.

    "text": "Guy Fieri never steers you in the wrong direction...  We went here this particular afternoon after watching a previous episode of Triple D and since we were in the Phoenix Metro area we just had to try it out! When you walk into this place it look like a little mom and pops grocery store but when you get to the back where the deli is its like a slice of heaven back there. They have this huge menu that you can choose from with pastas, pizza, cold and warm sandwiches, and desserts to die for.   We ended up ordering the Veggie lasagne and the Pizza Bianca. I let my fiance decide as I know she is a little more pickier than I am when it comes to Italian or I would of ordered Spaghetti and Meatballs and a sandwich filled with lots of goodies and finished off with a side of heartburn! The Lasagne was excellent. The veggies were fresh and crunchy. The sauce definitely compliments the dish very well and the pasta I think is even fresh! The pizza bianca is basically a margherita without the sauce and Ricotta cheese. The ricotta is so fresh you can definitely distinguish the freshness of it the crust is nice and crunchy and the fresh basil tickles your taste buds as you take each bite of your pizza.   What stole the meal was the desserts we ordered. Their chocolate covered Cannoli's are simply amazing and the Tiramisu there, words cannot describe how wonderful it was. I've had some really good Tiramisu over the years and I will say this was the best I've had in my entire life. The ladyfingers were spongy, the marscapone was so good you just couldn't stop and the balance and layers of flavor left you only wanting more. Unfortunately, we stored the Tiramisu overnight at our hotel in Tucson and ate it the next day only to discover how wonderful it was. It was way too late to come back and get more!   Our next trip to AZ we will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu. Overall I really enjoyed everything. Only downsides I can think of is its really not set up to be like a restaurant and its so busy but really worth the wait here! In addition, I forgot to mention the staff here really takes customer service very seriously. Everyone was super friendly and very patient when I explained to them it was our first try and we heard about you guys from Triple D and never once felt like they rushed us or was unhelpful with any of our questions.",

My friend hates \"crust\" but ate every bit of it after putting it on the side. I can't tell you how good it was in a simple review. Bianco downtown, Otto's in Tempe and DeFalco's in Scottsdale.

Cheese steak is still great, I even chop it up and freeze it now and it reheats really well which is most bonus if you don't live close to Defalco's. Eggplant parm freezes well too.  The Il Purista is packed with tons of prosciutto and it is delicious. Their gnocchi is really good, mac and cheese is really good, and the garlic toast is tasty.  They give you a decent side salad with your pasta entrees too which is nice considering how many restaurants don't throw in any extras.  Saving the best advice for last, you MUST try their sausage.   I wish they would open a Defalco's in North Scottsdale.....",

So I called DeFalco's and they were super accommodating, the manager Robert was professional, honest with the amount of portions we needed and eager to help a guest who wanted to give them business. We ordered a 6 foot Italian sub, a 5 foot veggie sub, two lasagna; one traditional and one vegetarian. The only thing about this experience that was better than Robert's helpful attitude, was the mouthwatering, hundred mile food(worth driving a hundred miles to eat it) they provided!!!  Well done team Defalco's you are an example for the misguided restaurant that puts more effort into policy than serving the guest!!! I recommend this restaurant for any of your dining needs!!!   Well done. CFC",

Defarlco's has been a Scottsdale staple for quite some time, but I do not remember ever stopping by. On this day, I am glad I did. We ordered the Beef Cheese Steak, with mushrooms and onions. I also got a side of their au jus sauce on the side for dipping. By the type I got home, this sandwich was still piping hot and smelled delicious. Everything tasted so fresh and my hubby inhaled his sub. We have added Defalco's to our take-our roster.  Thank you so much for bringing quality Italian food to Scottsdale!",

The icing on the cake is the sandwiches though. Served on Italian bread that is as standard soft and fluffy inside with a slight crisp to the outside. The deli has fantastic cheese and meet options.   Topher (the boyfriend who I will now call by name since he is almost always with me when I visit new places) had the Italian sausage and peppers sandwich that he too greatly enjoyed.   Casual, classic and a must stop stop.",

    "text": "Walking into Defalco's feels like Marty McFly stepping out of the DeLorean and walking into 1950's Hill Valley.  Most of the menu offerings are right out of any Brooklyn corner italian deli circa 1950.  This place is the antithesis of a soulless corporate chain.  I prefer the hot sandwiches - today's lunch was an eggplant parm sandwich (about $8) on a crusty roll.  To tell you the truth - just about everything/anything tastes awesome when placed on a toasted roll and smothered with thick marinara and melted mozzerella - but even so - the eggplant parm was awesomely great.  Happiness on a plate.  My only complaint is the randomness of line/wait time to order - which can vary from zero (today, Monday at 11:50 am) to seemingly forever.  The wait time is so unpredictable - about half the time I pop in at lunchtime I immediately turn around 'cause I don't have 15+ minutes to kill waiting to order.  But of course - that line tells you everything you need to know about this place.  The people have (correctly) spoken, and they gives two thumbs up to Defalco's.  One of my 'regular' lunch spots - and it should be one of yours, too.",

Needless to say, I am super impressed. Atmosphere is a little informal but you are eating at a grocery store! I am obsessed with all the authentic Italian ingredients for sale throughout the store, but the food was the star for sure. I got a full chicken parmigiana sandwich on focaccia bread, fiancee got turkey breast and provolone on wheat. Total for lunch was only 15 dollars which is amazing to me, and the quality of the food can be compared to real, homemade Italian cooking by someone's real, homemade Italian grandmother. I can't wait to go back and try everything else!",

Nothing amazing or out of the ordinary, just good sauce with good meatballs and noodles.  I think I probably would have thought the food here was more amazing if I had ordered a sandwich or calzone.  My friend ordered a calzone that was huuuuge and the filling looked really delicious and melty and cheesy.  Unfortunately for me, I can't eat dairy and most of their sandwiches and calzones had cheese.  I wanted to order the Philly cheesesteak - but wouldn't it be kind of ridiculous to order a CHEESEsteak without cheese?? ah well, maybe next time...  It's important to note that the only tables that accomodate 4+ people are out on the patio.  I came on a Saturday night around 7 with a group of 5 and we did not have trouble finding an open table on the patio.  But it was a little chilly, even though they had 2 heaters going!",

I had heard it is great authentic Italian food so I new I had to try it. I'm Italian, so I know when it is real!!! Since my first time trying DeFalco's, I have been back at least once a week.  I got the Penne with Vodka Sauce the first time which was amazing. It came with garlic bread and a side salad which were great as well. The next couple times I have gone I got the pesto pasta salad from the deli area and I love it. I always get it to go and keep it in my fridge but it only lasts me about a day because I cannot stop eating it. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for REAL Italian food like your Grandma used to make!!",

The italian combo came one way and thats it and that's with meat veggies etc.. All they could say is that its doordashes fault, not there. He laughed and said there nothing he can do for us.

If you're loving what you order, you can always pick up a few bags of pasta or sauce for the road! I'd like to go back here soon.",

    "text": "This place is amazing.  I'm sure you have had Italian food like me from several supposedly Italian restaurants and the food is mediocre at best.  Well that is not the case with Defalco's.  It's is the real deal.  I ordered a calzone which you pick the toppings from the pizza menu... so the options are vast.  I spotted the cheese cake and ordered a slice of strawberry and thought I was done.  Now the wait begins.  Defalco's isn't warming up your frozen calzone so ya...you have to wait while they stuff that calzone with all of the toppings you selected.  Trust me the wait it is worth every second!  During this time I'm walking around looking at the bread and drinks I notice the sandwiches being delivered again and again and again.  Each whole sandwich looking better than the last and they keep coming!  I couldn't take it anymore.  I got back into the line and ordered the epic \"Maximus\".  Again you pick what you want they don't assume anything which the term Made your way truly means something.  The prices are great for the portion and quality of food. My order came out Calzone and cheese cake first.  My sandwich was being made so I had to wait a little bit longer.  Again nothing pre-made here so chill while they create your master piece.  I was approached several times asking if I needed anything.  The staff is very friendly a bit confused why I was waiting since I was holding my order.  The staff and I had a laugh as I explained while waiting And seeing the sandwich's I had to order one.  I get my sandwich and head back to the hotel.  I arrive the calzone is still hot. This is an indicator it truly was fresh out of the over.  I started to dig in and WOW.  The red sauce and calzone ...amazing, cheese cake is tasty, and the sandwich ....well.. you will never want to order a sandwich from anywhere else again.  5 star because there is absolutely nothing I could find the least be disappointing.  Don't mind the pics in bad lighting.",

It isn't immediately apparent where you can go to order food. No problem, just go straight past the shelves of wine until you see a register. Ordering is quick and easy and the cashier was great.  My parents ordered just before my wife and I. All of us got a toasted sandwich of some sort, but my wife and I got paninis, which apparently take a while. In fact, people that sat down 5 minutes after us got their food first. My parents were done eating before we got our food, and we ordered right behind them. I understand a short delay, but this was pretty extreme.  The food, however, was amazing. One of the best paninis I've had. The ingredients were great, and I'd more than happily have it again... just don't make me wait for it.",

This one of a kind Italian deli nestled on the border or Scottsdale and Tempe has served me at least 15 lbs of prosciutto over the last few years. I go here for one reason only, the Il Purista sandwich. It's basically 1 while inch of prosciutto and fairy dust on a French baguette.   The only reason I'm giving Defalco's four stars is because the service is pretty rough. When I'm having an amazing day and feel on top of the world, I come to defalco's because I know they can even me out with their stern personalities, long wait times for takeout, and overall lack of smiling/positivity. Though I enter their doors and soon lose self esteem, I continue to come back time and time again to be reunited with their prosciutto and phenomenal ingredients.   Pro tip - leave your personality at the door but bring your tastebuds and second stoma   Update !!!  The owner, Anthony, messaged me personally about having better service and thanks for the feedback. Awesome awesome service and personability.",

We went ahead and ordered angel hair pasta with clam sauce and chicken pizza. The pasta was really light, well cooked but was expecting a little more sauce it was too dry for my taste. The pizza was one of the best I have had. The sauce was delicious and perfect amount of cheese and toppings. We also ordered Cannoli for dessert, the filling was fresh, light and tasty. The crust was alright.   I would definitely want to try their home made sauce and long list of sandwiches.",

It is not only pretty authentic Italian cuisine- but the ingredients are fresh and you can taste it. Their handmade dishes like pasta or their hot sandwiches are to die for. The sauces are rich, the portions huge, and the flavor is out of this world. The price definitely points to the quality- and I'm happy to pay a little more than average for outstanding food. Their desserts and pastries are very rich and heavy- you can tell everything is made from scratch! I'd recommend trying the gnocchi with Alfredo sauce or one of their cannolis- those are a few of my favorites here.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Used to live down the street and miss the place.  Came back after a long hiatus to see if anything has changed for the worse or better.  My first foray into Defalco's was the cheesesteak.  This is not your traditional Philly cheesesteak.  The Italian cheese mix is thick and rich, almost creamy, like a mornay.  This is very filling, stick-to-your-ribs cheesesteak.  And it's good.  The bread is substantial and chewy enough to stand up to the filling and there is plenty of cheese and plenty of beef.  Definitely one of the best menu items, but again, don't expect a taste of Philly.  On our last visit, ordered a couple sandwiches and a pasta dish.  The linguini with clam sauce is substantial.  It comes with a side salad and an order of garlic bread, and the pasta itself is quite large.  Some fresh clams on top and what I presume to be canned clams throughout.  The noodles were al dente enough - maybe just a little overcooked.  The main issue was seasoning.  It was underseasoned - almost criminally so.  It needed a big hit of salted butter or some parmegiano, something.  It wasn't a bad linguini and clam sauce, but it wasn't great.  Also ordered the Maximus and the Il Purista.  The Il Purista is quite good, and they put in enough prosciutto to balance out the rest of the sandwich.  I can't say the same for the Maximus.  Came in expecting an overstuffed Italian grinder given that it lists ham, salami, mortadella, pepperoni.  Just one or two slices each didn't give the sandwich enough substance, as opposed to the Il Purista.  One other small critique - if you order in, the place is a maze of Italian dry goods, so the server has a tough time finding you, especially when it's busy.  So come.  Definitely come for the sandwiches.  The cheesesteak especially, but the cold sandwiches are good too.  We'll give other pastas a try but I don't really recommend the linguini with clam sauce.",

    "text": "I had read about this place and had it on my bookmark list for quite some time.  I don't know how I never made it down here until the other day!  It was my 38th Birthday on Saturday (June 11th) and I was hanging out with a buddy from work and my brother in law.  I wanted to head down to Scottsdale and grab a sandwich here and then go smoke a cigar (see previous review).  We made our way down here around noon, walked in, got in line and ordered our sandwiches.  I went with a Large \"Maximus\".  My brother in law bought my lunch for me so I didn't pay squat ;-).  Regular price for that sandwich was around $10.00.  Here is how it was............  The Maximus-  This is a premium Italian sub!  Whenever I am new to a deli, I always tend to get their version of an Italian sub.  Happy to report, the Maximus is fantastic!  This sandwich came layered with Prosciutto, Capocollo, Genoa Salami, Mortadella and Provolone Cheese.  I got it topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and Italian dressing.  I chose the seeded sub roll as my bread.  This thing was set down in front of me and I was instantly happy!   This sub is huge!  A solid 12 inches or so.  The seeded bread they use was fantastic!  It had seeds on all sides of the bread, just not the top halves.  It was nice and soft and made an excellent base for the toppings.  Next time, I might ask for it slightly toasted/crisped up, because I think it would make it even better than it already was!  The meats were top notch quality and the produce was fresh.  The sandwich was just a tad dry and could have used more oil and vinegar, but besides that, it was damn near a perfect sub!  Definitely the best Italian sub I have had in Phoenix!    I will definitely be back to try out their other sandwiches.  I was highly impressed with the Maximus and if their other subs can come close to being as good as that one, I will be super satisfied.  Too bad its across the Valley, or I would be here way too often!  It was a great little store, and a fantastic birthday sandwich!  Good times!",

Defalco's is a combo of a store and restaurant. You are ordering you food at then waiting for the food at the table. We ordered a 12 inch pizza and a one salad (I was told it will be enough for a 2 persons and it was). Well, this is not a NJ pizza and I did not expect it to be(see my review for a La Gondola Pizzeria) , but for the  Scottsdale it's OK. Seating inside with the temperature at 87 F at 7:00 PM with no A/C (fans only), I don't know how so many people were preferring outside seating (one star down).",

    "text": "They make everything to order and the ingredients are fresh, but I don't know if the food was sitting out for a while or if they don't cook it piping-hot, because most of the meal came out lukewarm.  The Italian beef with provolone was just ok, nothing special - maybe a tad better than the version served at Portillo's.  The Centurion calzone was tasty - I liked the mix of ingredients (mozzarella, roasted peppers, Kalamata olives, sopressata, basil, and tomato), but again, I wish that it came out a little hotter, with the cheese a little more melted.  The calzone is pretty large, and the leftovers tasted better heated up the next day.  There are about 15 or so tables that fit 2-3 people each, and a line quickly forms during peak lunch hours.  It's hard for groups bigger than 3 people to really sit together, because most of the tables are small and seat only two.  You're also basically sitting and eating among grocery shelves.    I'd say that the marinara sauce was the best component of the meal, even though it (along with the sausages) also came out lukewarm.  But overall the food was not memorable or worth the drive.  And since I can buy San Marzano tomatoes at more and more places now, I don't think I will be coming back here.",

Today, I was watching Drive In, Diners and Dives and saw Guy ranting over what a great Calzone they make, needless to say we headed there for dinner.   I ordered the white pizza and a calzone...and this was a PEPSI establishment, I know that doesn't mean much to some but it does to others. Anyway, the pizza  was thin and crunchy which I like, and garnished pretty with lots of basil. The basil is what saved this pizza because it barely had any ricotta and not much flavor. I literally had 2 slices, my boyfriend had one, and we took the rest home, this is not usual. My boyfriend ordered a calzone, when it came out the bottom was completely burned, enough that scraping off the bottom wasn't enough because you can taste it through eat bite. I took his plate with the calzone upside down to the counter and asked if this looked burned to the guy at the counter who more or less shrugged his shoulders and asked us if we wanted them make another one. I just got our money back.   I was not impressed, and would not recommend this place. There are other places in the valley with much better Italian food.",

So had to try it out. It's in a decent location and could use an expansion. For just buying something to-go, it's great. If your going to dine in, it's a bit of a nightmare. The layout of this location is way to cluttered, they have one of the main doors locked to fit a shelf with products. Then you have all the traffic by the fountain drinks and not so good working soda machines' ice maker. The ice was getting stuck and you had people banging it to get the ice.  Now! On to the food. We ordered a couple of calzones which were very good and alot bigger than we thought. The Gnocchi with Red Sauce is also very good. The pizza my daughters ordered wasn't that great, looked very unappetizing and very greasy. I honestly don't think there was any sauce on that pizza.  This is for the owners! If your going to complain (as this shorter gentlemen was doing outside) about the extra traffic your getting from being featured on DDD, than don't do it. You should be happy you were on TV.",

Definetely the best italian deli I have been to and I will recommend it to all my friends and family. It is very casual, you order by the register and they call your number and take your food to your table. We waited around 15 minutes for the pizza and sandwiches so that made us very happy (we were starving). It is very very family oriented and we loved that too!! You wont be disappointed ;) great food, friendly staff!!",

As someone who ate here 3 times in a 24 hr period, I feel especially compelled to tell you about their cheesesteak. HO-LY-SHIT. Easily the most decadent, flavorful cheesesteak I've had in a VERY long time - and I live 15 minutes outside of Philly. Im still in disbelief that they could pull something like that off. Ask for yours on the soft roll.  I should also mention the sausage,  peppers & onion sandwich, which was really good. I suspect they make their own sausage, which elevates them to superstar status in my book. The chicken parm sandwich and dinner are both equally good, and the meatball sandwich deserves honorable mention as well.  I dont do cold subs, but the ones I saw coming out of the kitchen looked huge and tasty. Perhaps I will try their pizza next time I'm in town.",

Yes, it was going to be a wonderful description of how much I love the food, blah, blah, blah...  That was until I waited 35 minutes for a cheesesteak.  35 minutes.  For a sandwich.    No, it wasn't during the lunch rush.  In fact, there were only 4 other people in the store.  I walked right up to the counter to order, as there was not a line (a first!).  And then proceeded to wait.  And wait.  And wait some more.  35 minutes, to be exact, thanks to the time-stamp on my receipt.  I have been to Defalco's on more occasions than I can count, and know to expect a longer than average wait.  Hey, quality takes time.  I get it.  I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every item I have tried there - pizza, calzone, cold sandwiches, deli items and of course my personal favorite, the cheesesteak.  My partner in culinary crime counts their food, especially their four-meat combo sandwich, among his favorite things.    Unfortunately, 35 minutes for one sandwich in a practically empty place is ridiculous enough to make me re-think my formerly 5-star opinion.",

I got a whole-size order of fettuccine alfredo, which came with a side salad and garlic bread. The garlic bread was so-so, but the fettuccine alfredo had generous heaps of sauce, chicken with a fried breading, and the salad was made with fresh ingredients. There was so much that I couldn't eat it all. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to order at the counter, and it's a long wait, especially since we got stuck behind some indecisive people who were standing in front of the register staring at the menu for fifteen minutes.",

The wait can be anywhere from 15 to 35 minutes, depending upon the time of year so get there early or call ahead to place your order.  Trust me when I say, it's worth it.  DeFalco's uses some of the best meats and cheeses and everything is sliced to order.  Sandwiches range in price from $6 to $7.50 for full sandwiches but 1/2 sandwiches are available as well.  My favorite is the dried soppressata, capacollo and provolone sandwich; it is the best in my opinion but they have a great reputation for their cheesesteak sandwich.  They have a nice selection of desserts that range from cheesecake and Italian wedding cookies to cannoli and pizzells.         They also boast a great selection of Italian grocery items that range from pasta to wine and cheeses to spumoni.  I hear their italian sausage is really good.  The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is small but clean.  I definitely recommend giving DeFalco's a try.  You wont be disappointed.",

I'd gladly spend an extra $2.50 then have to settle for Subway, etc.  I highly recommend DelFalco's chicken pesto sandwich and pizza.

Expect to wait a 1/2 or more for your food to arrive though, it will not be done quickly but it will be worth the wait. Call ahead if you are in a hurry! The desserts are also delicious, not to mention it contains a market with a surplus of Italian ingredients to make your own meal at home. Your Italian Grandma would be so proud!",

Not because it's a massive store, or the wait for food takes forever, it's just that Defalco's is that popular and usually always packed. If you aren't happy about that, take it up with Guy Fieri.   That being said, I really do enjoy this nice Italian grocery. The food they put out is consistent which is pretty key, and it's just flat out delicious. It's traditional Italian food done traditional ways. This isn't Olive Garden.   I usually get some ravioli or pasta for lunch here and afterwards buy some salami or sausage to take home along with some pasta. There are two really good traditional Italian grocery stores in Scottsdale, and this is one of them for sure.   The only downfall to this, is the previous mentioned popularity. It's not a big shop, it doesn't have a ton of seating and you feel a bit crammed while in line. There is definitely plenty of parking though. I would love to see them move to a bigger location and thrive more and be able to accommodate the crowds they usually accrue on any given afternoon.   Bottom line. Go here. Eat great food. Be happy.",

It is pretty much the staff. They seem to have people on the kitchen line who do not care. One time asked for parm cheese packets for my pizza and they said they were out. But they asked the kitchen line for some for another customer and they got it.  Also, their food is not as good as you see on the reviews here. I am from NY and it does not even come close. Arizonians and snowbirds  have no idea what is good Italian food. This place has no clue how to make a meatball parm hero. Ordered once and never again. Pizza ok nothing to jump for joy. Portions are good. But the seating and beverage area is a little dirty most of the time.  It is shame because this was a go to place for take out dinner after a long day at work.

Everything we have ordered thus far has been amazing, flavorful and fresh.   I believe that the owners' family originally came from Italy, which explains the atmosphere of the deli. It reminds me of a typical european deli, mixing fresh foods you can order to your liking, along with a small selection of groceries and specialty items.  I like to buy certain groceries here but they are a little more expensive, given that the majority are imported. They've got some great products - fancy cheese, a giant selection of olive oil, unique pastas (gnocchi, fusilli), and lots of wine.   To date, my boyfriend and I have tried:  cheesesteak (must try it!!! get it on the Italian roll with grilled onions, mushrooms, and peppers),  chicken parmigiana sandwich,  italian sausage sandwich with peppers (homemade sausage, i would recommend adding cheese), cheese ravioli, artichoke and vegetable lasagna (amazing!), caprese salad (homemade mozzarella cheese!!), and  spinach, avocado and goat cheese salad.  We are looking forward to eating everything on the menu, but it is always difficult to try something new when everything we've tasted has been amazing.  Don't forget about ordering desserts! Tiramisu, cannolis, chocolate eclairs, lemoncello cake... I have a sweet tooth and I am happy to report that they do not disappoint.",

Their sub sandwiches are like a meat party in your mouth.  Their noodles are creamy and delicious.  All of their salads and antipasti are unreal.   Always a long line and it's kind of overwhelming inside but it is so so so worth the wait!",

I order the Mozzarella, Tomato, and Basil (Cold Sandwich) + Prosciutto. The bread has the perfect crunch, the oil and vinegar are authentic, and the prosciutto is some of the best in the Valley. If you love Caprese, this sandwich IS your jam, I promise! I will be back wayyyy more often for lunch thanks to this fabulous reminder! Thank you for ALWAYS impressing, Defalco's!",

The reason I cannot give 5 stars is because although the food is always tasty, the service is mediocre, always.I've expereinced quite a few inconsistent orders - the dressing to my salad is wrong, bread isn't included in the bag when I get home, etc. When you walk in for a pick up order the staff is always frazzled, rushed and seems understaffed. Last night was my last straw. We placed an order over the phone at 5:30, it was supposed to take 30 minutes. We went to pick it up, stood around waiting for 25 minutes while staff completely ignored me, didn't seem to have a clue what was going on - then they tried to give me my food that had been sitting ready for 20 minutes. I don't want old food. I left the food and got my money back. Needless to say I think I'm done ordering food from here.",

My last few visits have been awesome once I got my order in, that's the hard part as there are 2 order stations and each one is for it's own items. First timers will be confused, as I was as the lines snake through the tiny grocery lined dining room. stick with it and focus, as the payoff is amazing  It's ultra casual for sandwiches and Italian dishes this good. Quality sliced meats and cheeses are priced well and the specialty grocery items like San Marzano tomatoes and great Italian wine abound.  This is one of those hole in the wall gems! trust me and check this place out.",

As a resident of the tri-state NYC area, I can say with unwavering and steadfast confidence that this is without a doubt the worst deli I have ever been to in my entire life.  The level of apathy and cognitive dissonance in this place was astounding.  I ordered- Chicken cutlet, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, oil and vinegar and I essentially received a Subway quality chicken tender sandwich with some shredded mozzarella cheese covered in marinara, on the stalest bread to ever curse this earth.  How people can possibly rate this place at 4 1/2 stars blows my mind.  I could literally go to the worst restaurant in Yonkers, NY and get a superior sandwich. You people make me ashamed to share the name. I think I will be legally changing my last name to Lindquist just so I can avoid any potential association with this abomination.  Embarrassing",

I specifically asked for it on the side. So instead of starting over, they included cups with extra on the side. Ew. By the time I got home it was soggy. The flavors were good but definitely not worth the price. I thought everything was overpriced actually. I dont mind spending a decent amount for a sammich but that was a rip off. I browsed the other items available and the selection was extensive and crammed into a super tiny space. I don't think I will be back.",

When he asked if I wanted mayo, mustard or Italian dressing I replied Italian. Then when he said \"so you want everything\". I repeated no that I did not want mustard or mayo. At this point the guy in line though he would jump in and educate me on how to order a sandwich. I have some angry words that I am holding back from my review about this guy. I told him I knew what I was doing and he continued to mettle. I told him to stop. I finalized my order and was trying to pay when the cashier instead turned to ask the guy behind me what he wanted because he assumed we were together!!! 30 minutes wait and my sndwich arrives. The bread was delicious and all was fresh. Not enough cheese though. The menu should list that the sandwich I ordered is comprised of the spicey hot meat. It was not as I expected. The bread was yummy.  Overall though I have had better thus the two star rating.",

    "text": "Perhaps the reason for my three-star review is my expectations of this triple D eatery were a little bit too high.  My wife and I stopped in for a \"quick \" lunch on our way to run a few errands. The meal was nothing but quick, after waiting online for about half an hour to place my order, we waited for a good 40 minutes before being brought half of our ordered meal. Ice cold.    After sending it back and getting a quick apology, my wife's calzone came out. The calzone was about what you would expect - ton of cheese, pepperoni, dough cooked perfectly. It was actually quite delicious.   Then, my sandwich which was featured on diners drive-ins and dives return. While it was praised in several of the reviews on here and on TV as gods gift to earth, I felt like it was nothing really that special. A little bit too much bread and the homemade sausage while flavorful was not all that unique and mild in seasoning (I ordered the hot sausage). The food was probably four stars in quality I just had higher expectations after all the reviews and TV segments and word of mouth.  With respect to the interior, the place is crowded. But cute queens and features and Italian markets that carries specialty items that look quite interesting. Personally, not a huge fan of people looking over your shoulder to view items while you eat but to each his own.  If I return, it will be for a planed to take out order or to go order. The bakery and antipasto looked really appealing. As far as for a sub sandwich or pizza - I'm more likely to get something closer to home with an abundance of high-quality pizza in Phoenix Arizona.  Overall, it was pretty damn good. But just not that good.",

I had the classic Italian sandwich and it was...GREAT! A nice shot of espresso to go with, and one of my buddies got the Italian meatball sandwich (with cheese) he says it's awesome, and I always believe what he says, so it's awesome. A little side note, the deli and restaurant sit amidst an Italian grocery store and they actually had a couple items I had been searching all over for: hot giardinara mix and sport peppers. Yes, sport peppers are nowhere to be found in Phoenix...except at DeFalco's! In case you are wondering, sport peppers are the ones used in Chicago-style hot dogs, so you can't have an authentic Chicago-style hot dog without sport peppers, and you can't have sport peppers in Phoenix without visiting Defalco's. Actually, you should bring a few hundred dollars to blow in the grocery store because every item is unique, and you're going to want at least one of everything. You have been told. In conclusion, our afternoon at DeFalco's was pleasurable and  out of the ordinary. I am looking forward to our next visit. Oh yeah, CANOLIS!",

Not much to not like here (location is kind of in a crappy area but who cares too much when the food is this tasty) There is a bit of a crowd during the lunch hour, but you would be hard pressed to find a better italian market like this in south scottsdale. Try it at least once folks.",

Anyway, my sandwich was good, had turkey on a baguette and think I may have enjoyed something else better but still liked it. Also had their tortellini pasta salad which was awesome. Loved the outdoor patio and although we didn't get any beers, they have a great selection of those too. Very friendly people working there and looks like some interesting/authentic Italian food in the grocery area.",

The frizzled beef was well seasoned and not greasy. The cheese was melted and mixed throughout, warm gooey goodness on a soft Italian roll which was reminiscent of a fresh Amoroso roll. I asked for hot sauce and was offered Tabasco. Once again, kudos to Anthony DeFalco for his willingness to incorporate customer feedback. That's truly as good as it gets!",

I prefer dining in. There's patio seating, a TV usually with a good game on and good music - Pinback, The Shins, Fleet Foxes?! (Although I was iffy about staying last time to enjoy my meal, due to the fact that Morrissey was playing.. but I'm pretty sure it was a huge mistake/defect and it won't happen again)   The staff here reminds me of the neighborhood deli's back East: until they know you, they don't care what you order, what you think and who you are..but when they start recognizing you, you feel like part of a secret family.   It may be a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. I prefer quality of food and quality of staff, as opposed to how fast I can choke it down on my lunch break.    Savor it.",

While I've never purchased anything from the grocery or deli, they do have a ton of traditional Italian products for sale. Everything you'd need to prepare a delicious Italian feast!   What I go there for are the sandwiches. I'm a HUGE fan of their tuna sandwiches. I order them with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pepperoncinis. I also LOVE the macaroni pasta salad, but only get that if I can restrict myself to half of a tuna sandwich. I've had the egg salad before, and while it's an acceptable alternative when they're out of tuna, I only order it when I can't get my fav. They've got a pretty decent beer selection too which is great if you're stopping in on a Sunday afternoon and would like an \"adult beverage\" with your meal.   I've not yet tried their pizza or pasta, but will be sure to post an update once I do. It always looks and smells delicious!",

With me having a gluten-allergy, I was a little hesitant to go but did agree to meet him there, and just decided beforehand that I would get a salad to keep my allergy from flaring up.  He got there a few minutes before me and asked the owner if they had any gluten-free dishes, he advised that they did not really have any on the menu, but that they did sell gluten-free pasta on their grocery shelves and that he would be willing to set up a fresh pot of boiling water for GF pasta and that I could choose from any of the dishes on the menu and substitute the GF pasta for the regular.  How could I turn down an offer like that??  My pasta was just as AMAZING as the customer service!",

I have lived in Arizona for 20+ years and this was my first visit to to Defalco's..And my last.. I was very excited to try the food as all the reviews are very good.. I went in thinking it would be a back in  New York experience, store is very cute selection of items in store plentiful.. Store/ deli was clean and well organized. I went to counter and placed my order. I ordered a meatball sub and Ceasar Salad with avocado, service was pretty fast and I took my food to go.. I got home with very high expectations, wow !!  I opened my meal ready to enjoy some great Italian food :/ ummm.. not so much.. I started with my salad, it looked nice ..as I started eating it I realized there was a gritty substance in it that I couldn't place, upon further investigation I realized the gritty stuff was actually mud/dirt because the romaine lettuce had not been washed..Really??  Okay I said well I guess that was just an error on someones part I will proceed with my meatball sub.. Being Italian myself I would say I have had some tasty meatballs.. well the meatballs on my sub were not tasty at all, flavorless ..Yes , Odd texture.. Yes.. Sauce? below average.. My thoughts? How is this place getting rave reviews?? I am sad to say that my experience was very bad , and not only would I not return but I would also tell people that the food is not worth the visit to Delfalco's..",

    "text": "Oh My, Went to this place Christmas eve for a sandwich.  The parking lot was crazy full of people coming in and out, so I decided this was a great place to check out.  When I walked in, it was crazy busy.  Lots of people piled by the deli counter picking up their holiday meats and cheeses.  I just came for lunch, so I sorta cut the line and went strait to the sandwich ordering station.  It was confusing though to figure out where to go with so many people in line.    I ordered a sandwich with 3 meats on it to split with my husband. We got a monster drink and a regular soda, and some chips.  Total was pretty cheap like $12-$13 bucks.  We walked over to where the tables were to wait for our meal.  Watching all the shoppers was differently a spectacle.  Also we had time to check the place out.  It's really casual and has racks of Italian items for sale, such as hard to find wines, pasta's and freshly baked breads.    Our meal came out hand delivered in a basket, and the guy delivering was kind enough to ask me if I wanted another basket for my portion to be put in.  I thought it was really sweet of him to ask, because the place was a zoo, and just having to go past all the shoppers must have been a hassle.  But he came back with a huge smile but a minute later.  I took a huge bite of the sandwich, and wow, it was really good.  You could actually tell the quality of meats and cheeses in the sandwich along with some good dressing that came dripping out of my sub sandwich.  It was a huge sandwich and I was glad I only got half, but only wished we had ordered another one for dinner.  Yes it was that good.  But I didn't want to wait in line again.  Good Stuff....Wish this place was closer to my house.",
