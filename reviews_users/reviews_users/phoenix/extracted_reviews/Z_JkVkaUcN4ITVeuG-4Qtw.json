They sat us on the 2nd floor balcony which I highly recommend even if it's a tad chilly outside (they had space heaters). The beer selection was good, but not great as you would expect at a \"gastropub\". Maybe 15-20 beers total in this place. We had the hangover fries sans-eggs and these were fantastic! Great amount of toppings and the fries themselves are delicious. Crispy on the outside like Arby's curly fries. So good!",

I was visiting Scottsdale and searched high and low for a trendy Sunday brunch restaurant that had good drink specials and fun music, and Yelp definitely took me there!  We got here on a Sunday around 12:30pm and it was a 40 minute wait.  That didn't bother us because we enjoyed bottomless mimosas ($15 a person with the purchase of an entree) outside on the patio while we waited.  The mimosas were really good and I almost had too many!    I ordered the \"build your omelet\" dish and my bf ordered the Breakfast Burrito.  The omelet was really dry, but maybe this is how the omelet's are made in AZ.  In Texas, we like them much more juicy, so that is my only issue with this place.  The burrito was really good and so were the potato (hash browns).    The music was great and the atmosphere was fun and perfect for a young crowd!  If I am in the area again, I will definitely come again for Sunday brunch!",

We wanted to go somewhere a little different than our usual, but in the same general area. I thought of this place because a friend of mine used to work there. So we looked on their website to see what time happy hour was. They had one at the right time so we decided to check it out.   We were nicely received, however when our server came to our table she seemed like she was annoyed that she had to help us. We asked what was on the happy hour menu; her response, \"it's Sunday, we don't have happy hour.\" We mentioned that the website said they did, her response \"it's wrong.\" No sorry about that or anything. So despite the let down on happy hour we decided to go ahead and order.   When the food got there we were missing my friends pretzel bites.... No explanation. Our server didn't even check on us and we had to flag someone down to ask about her food about 10 minutes later. It really is a shame the service was so awful, because the food and atmosphere are awesome!! Guess a lot has changed since my friend worked there. We won't be back.",

The place had a good energy pumping thru, even though it was 110 degrees outside. It was busy when we came in on a Friday afternoon, but we were able to find seats at the bar. The bartenders are really nice, and constantly made their way around the bar to make sure everyone was \"hydrated.\"  We dropped in for a quick bite before picking up a friend at the airport for dinner, so we just ordered apps: pulled pork sliders, buffalo chicken lollipops, hangover fries, and a few beer cocktails. Let me just say that the BBQ sauce for the sliders alone made my day. It's got such deep flavors with a little sweet and smokey kick. What knocked it out of the park for me was the texture. It was almost like a chutney. Man did I want to just spread that on anything I could get my hands on. Alright, back to reality. It was the first time I had chicken lollipops, and I have to say I probably prefer them over wings. It's the perfect tender chunk of chicken atop a bone. It was so easy to eat. I bet it took no longer than 30 seconds for us to finish the entire dish. The hangover fries? Well the name says it all. I lathered on a little BBQ sauce, and well, you know how that went. The beer cocktails was the perfect drink to wash everything down, refreshing and light, yet still had great depth and flavor. RNR is definitely one of my go-to spots when I visit AZ.",

Came here for their dj bottomless Champagne Sunday brunch. The wait for a table was long as the house was PACKED  with mid and late 20 year olds chugging down on the bottomless champagne, that along with a brunch entree came to an affordable $15.. $25 without an entree. However, don't let the loud music and tiny bopper drinking binge fool you. The burgers and bar food here is banging!  The burgers are good enough to gain thumbs up from the most elitist of burger snobs! Came here with a party of 4. We ALL  were very happy with our food- 4 various burgers. The jalapeno mac n cheese was worth every hot sexy spicy cheese loaded calorie. Great diet cheat day detour! Loved the food! Not a fan of the service tho!  In all fairness,  they were absolutely slammed! Yet is this ever really an excuse.  Come here for a sunny Sunday Funday with your fun friends!  Not family friendly for brunch by no means.  #azrestaurant #whereToEat #azFood #Phoenix #az #Scottsdale #phoenixEats #brunch #azBrunch #goodEats #sundayFunday #dayParty",

Despite one experience with good service, there have been six other times when I have had  incredibly awful service. That's not a good ratio and at this point, I just can't justify coming back nor would I recommend RnR at all.  My most recent experience sealed the one star review. First, there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us. We sat ourselves. Then, we sat at a table for about 10 minutes. No waiter to be seen. No one even came around to serve the other tables around us with patrons. Ah ha! Next, we spot a waiter. After inquiring with this individual as to where our waiter was/if they were closing or something (trying to give them benefit of the doubt) the waiter looked at us begrudgingly, gave us a half eye roll and said, \"I guess I can serve you.\"  Well, after that remark I just wanted to get up and walk out. But I stayed (a decision that I now regret) only to experience more poor service.   We needed more drinks, our waiter was nowhere to be found. Then we noticed all the waiters hanging out near the order input computers. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and I know my order wasn't being taken or put into the computer... instead it looked like social hour. Unprofessional.   This is not the first time that I have experienced inattentive and no-where-to-be-seen service at RnR, and I guess I should have known better. I don't even think my request to be seated so that I could have a waiter take my order was THAT outlandish.  I work very hard for my money to be able to enjoy some \"RnR\" on the weekends. So, with lots of other places (like AZ88, Old Town Tavern, Mabel's on Main, Firehouse, Pattie's, The Lodge, Geshia-A-Go-Go, and the list could go on) where I can count on being served... by an actual live body nonetheless... who doesn't even make me feel like they hate me just because I walked through the door... there's no reason to come here.  It was especially awful to be treated so poorly when I'm a Giants fan, and my team's flag is hanging out front of the establishment!! I'm going to pass on anymore of this place's \"RnR,\" as I'm pretty sure it actually stands for \"Really Rude\" service.",

The food is typically better then average, service average, and prices decent. Tonight was a new experience.   We were sat outside on the patio in the couch seating right after the start of Thursday night football.  Shortly after, we were asked for drinks and appetizers. Then again, in a very acceptable amount of time, our server brought our drinks and a runner brought our appetizer. So far so good.   All went downhill after this. It soon became apparent that our waiter had to many tables, so he made a decision to ignore the patio. A runner brought our food out, and the server took our appetizer plate away, but left without asking if we would like our empty beers filled, let alone ever once offer a water. I decided to start eating to keep my food from getting cold, but after 15-20 more minutes without seeing him, I went to the bar to order. The bartender went and got my server. Instead of seeing us, he went to the table next to us to get their drinks. I had to get up again and follow him to the bar to order from him.   Our drinks came later with no apology and our plates were cleared. I sat another 15 minutes waiting to ask for the check, but the server never came. I went and found the server, followed him to the register, and paid him on the spot.   I have not been back since.",

Food is all above average to pretty good, and has some unique selections that you won't find elsewhere.  Great brunch atmosphere, and you can't beat the bottomless Bloody Marys and Mimosas.   Gotta love the bacon in the bloody mary by the way!   Live music at times throughout the week, and we like to head down on Thursdays for a chill drink our two around 8:30.  My only gripe is that their beer selection is very blase and only offer the run of the mill bud light, miller light, coors light, etc..  A couple unique craft beers like IPA's and Hefeweizen's would be a nice match for their unique environment.  As a marketing guy, I love RnR's embrace of using social networks to market their product, and if you like RnR be sure to friend them on Facebook as they post good specials on a daily basis.

Drinks: I had to send my glass of prosecco back twice because it was flat. Now, I know prosecco does not have as many bubbles as champagne, but this was completely flat. Finally, I get a third glass that wasnt flat...but upon taking my first sip...it tasted like chardonnay with bubbles. SIck. Prosecco is supposed to be light, and dry with a little hint of fruit to it. What was that?   Food: We ordered a baked brie, spinach artichoke dip, and the truffle fries. The baked brie came out as being baked, and then falling cold. The spinach artichoke dip was more like soup, and the fries were lukewarm and soft. The server offered to have the baked brie put \"back through the salamander\", wherein I declined the offer. Really? Baked brie in a salamander? *Cringe*.   Overall the food and drinks were near terrible. Again, the server was really nice, and it definately wasnt her fault. The manager came by, noticing we didnt eat much of the food, and after telling him how things turned out he comped our entire bill. While that was nice of him, hopefully he came to the realization that he needs to hand the chef a red bull or something.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch, guess I missed the memo about it moonlighting as a nightclub. Lots of beautiful people, short skirts, and a DJ spinning fresh tunes. its a swanky spot with two floors and ample outdoor patios. Girls were bobbing and strutting their stuff at the bar, sure made me feel out of place in my cutoff jeans. Don't get me wrong, there is a chill vibe that permeates throughout, and plenty of hipster shades, shirts and flip flops gracing the premises. To top it off the food wasn't bad and they had $15 bottomless mimosas. if you go, make sure to doll up a bit and dabble on some cologne... and get ready to mingle. Go for the atmosphere, stay for the food.",

    "text": "Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol Honestly my lunch was just okay Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype  But, I am supposed to be honest.  This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.  The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it.   One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.  The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.  I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily.   I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.  So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.   What I paid for this was ridiculous. The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous. The food was meh. Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there. It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.  One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.  Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!",

    "text": "I came in a couple weekends ago for my birthday. I had called a few weeks prior and asked if I could make a reservation since I would have a larger party. The girl had told me yes as long as it was before the bottomless mimosas started. As it got closer to the date I called with my confirmed amount of guests and this time they told me I would have to pay $50 per person to make a reservation! So I decided to get there an hour before the mimosas started and put my name on the list. I was quoted an hour and a half for 14 people. Not a big deal so we waited... And waited...and waited. After about an hour and a half I had gone up to the host and asked where we were on the list. She said we were next.... I had told her at this point we just wanted to sit and eat and she could split us up if that would make it faster. Mind you there were 2 tables next to the host stand where the tables sat 6 but one had 2 people at it and another had just one guy! Why would they do that?! So we waited longer, and at this point some people had left. Then I go up again and she said no tables had gotten up except for 4 tops. I then again told her we were okay with getting split up. So she sat 4 of us right then. Cool finally after 2 hours 4 of us get to eat. Sit down and order our food. Our food comes and still no one else gets seated. I go to the bathroom and check with the host about the rest of the group and she said a 12 top is getting cleaned off and they are about to seat them. Yay finally! I'm now finished with my food and nothing has been done yet. Then the table next to us gets up and leaves... It was another 4 top. So I go up to the host and ask if she can seat the next 4 in my group and she says as long as a table is open I can sit them there. Cool yay after almost 3 hours... NOPE up walks 4 people I've never met. Im confused? So at this point I ask for the manager. I guess they just let anyone out of college become a manager now days. The guy was completely rude and told me it was the servers friends. Okay so after waiting 3 hours only 4 of my party of 14 is sat and if you know someone who works there you get to just walk on in and sit down?! And what happened to the 12 top that they were cleaning off? He then tells me I should of made a reservation. Oh that's hilarious because I tried! He did not once apologize and argued with me, yes he sat there and argued with me that their hosts have a system and he told me I just wasn't sober to understand!! I've worked in restaurants and I completely understand the system... I came to celebrate my birthday and I just wanted all my friends to be together which he also comments yeah so is everyone else here. Cool! I won't be back after this experience!!! A manager should never act like that to a guest. Oh and no one else got sat after.",

    "text": "RnR gets a solid 3 stars in my book, and although there's not much to complain about here....there's not a whole lot to rave about either.  The place is done very nicely with lots of raw iron, and you can tell the Corieri's sunk some serious $$$ in the buildout (yes, same folks that own Axis-Radius, Suede, and Sandbar).  Thumbs UP:  -Nice selection of beers on tap -Above average bar fare--ahi tacos are delicious and have not once induced vomiting -Spacious patio  Thumbs DOWN:  -Sunsets + western exposure = untolerably hot patio much of the year--which is True with most patios in AZ.  BUT, if the patio isn't open the main bar becomes very crowded and tough to move around in -It has TV's...but not really the quantity, size, or placement to make it a top pick for sporting events -Service is inconsistent as I've had excellent and subpar experiences  I think the situation with RnR is that is struggles with an identity of what it truly is, be it bar, restaurant, sports bar, etc.  Because of this it's hard to get a feel for the place.  I would list it as a top spot for HH when you're looking for good eats, but wouldn't have it on my list solely for a meal or just a cocktail.  Jack of all trades and master of none?",

    "text": "I have seen this place on the weekend evenings all packed with people looking like they're sardines in a can, so what possessed me to go there for brunch one day?  I shall never know.  I did, though, and I have to say, the food was yuck, the coffee was watered down, and the service was slow.  I ordered the two 'specialties' on the menu, which were the Sundried Scramble with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, goat cheese and scrambled eggs and the maple-bacon scone.  Aside from the fact that my brunch buddie and I literally waited 30 minutes for the food to come out, the food wasn't even that good!!  The Sundried Scramble was something I probably could've made myself at home (and better!), and the scone was just not good.  Actually, they brought out the wrong scone at first, and when the correct one came out, I thought, I should've just said not to bring one at all cuz it was drier than what people who don't live in Arizona consider the state's summers.  Also, as my friend and I were walking up to RnR, I saw one of the wait staff lounging around with sunglasses on.  Forgive me if I am wrong, but I think sunglasses should not be worn by wait staff at a restaurant especially for brunch if you are trying to make a statement that the place is as classy as Scottsdale thinks it is.  Shame on you, RnR.  I'm going across the street to go eat at Daily Dose.",

The place has a cool look to it, inside-outside bar tables sitting right on a busy street in front of a bus stop. Don't sit at the table right on the sidewalk because the fast moving traffic is annoying - did I mention the bus stop? The food was nothing special, the salad with ahi was dry, either over cooked or just not fresh. The monster frys were something a teenag boy might throw together after school. I'm sure they are not trying to compete with the top-notch food choices in the area, unfortunately I just had those higher expectations for dinner this night. There are TV's everywhere and I'm sure its a great place to watch the game so I can't take that away from them.  If you are looking for Grub, Beer and the Game this place won't disappoint.

    "text": "I really wanted to review RnR after the first time I went there for happy hour.  The setup was awesome as I found myself perfectly situated on the patio between two flat screen tvs watching the playoffs.  I was impressed with the layout and comfort level of the patio, along with a great looking menu and decent mix of patrons.  They do a good job with some minor details (like the gum tabs in the table settings), however now that I've been there 4-5 times, I've come to realize their weakness lies in service.  The last three times I've been there, we've had as many problems with our service.  For one, our food came out without any silverware.  The runner didn't notice and also only brought out two of the three items ordered.  We were not asked if we needed any ketchup for our fries either.    On a separate occasion, we stopped in for a few drinks around 9pm.  I was dragging ass from a long day at work and decided to order a Redbull/Vodka.  Rockstar was poured & sold to us without even asking.  I'm no trademark attorney, but I don't think Redbull would be too happy to hear that patrons are unknowingly being served a substitute energy drink (one of Redbull's largest competitors) without providing a heads-up.  Many would also consider this consumer fraud.  Although I let it slide after noticing the staff's uniforms are proudly showcasing the Rockstar logo.   This last time, I was there for brunch on Saturday.  My buddy wanted to eat somewhere with a great tv setup.  So I took him to RnR talking up the patio setup.  We sat on the patio to enjoy the plethora of sporting events that were on:  Playoff hockey, NBA playoffs, PGA tourney, NFL draft, etc.  Once we were sat, both tvs on the patio were showing Penn State freshman football scrimmage...in April!  I politely asked our server if he could have it changed to one of the aforementioned events.  The server just looked at me with a blank look and gave us no response.  After 15 minutes of Nittany Lion practice, I went to chat to the bar tender.  The bar tender immediately came outside and worked it out.  Apparently, our server just dismissed our request.    When our food came out, my meal was incorrect.  A completely different dish than what I ordered.  Luckily, the MOD came over and asked how we were doing.  Right then our server came over.  When he figured out that my meal was wrong, all he did was shrug his shoulders.  I don't think he has much serving experience.  The manager, Kathleen, was the one who took my plate and assured me they'd get it right.    Not only did she correct my order, but she comped that item for us.  Her approach, solution, and sincerity was enough to bring me back again.  Not to mention, she's a fox.  Thank you K.C.  I will return to give RnR another shot.  FYI...I read some other reviews and many people commented on the noise from the bikes across the street.  Most of the comments happened to be during Arizona Bike Week, which was the third week of April.  I don't see that being an ongoing concern.  There are always bikes up and down Scottsdale Rd, but I would give RnR a little consideration on that.    Overall, food is okay.  I've had some good plates and not-so-good plates.  I ordered the baby back ribs once.  I was told it was a full slab of ribs, but indeed was only a half slab.  They were tasty, but I split the entree with someone because we were told it was a full slab.  So we both left there a little hungry.    I'm giving three stars because it's a cool spot, great location, good atmosphere and they do a lot of things right.  However, they're still somewhat new and have plenty of room to step up the service.  In order to compete in this part of town, I'm fairly confident that they'll improve on their weakness.",

Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.    We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then.",

    "text": "Is it True?  Has the hip-urban-kool Phoenix scene made its way into Scottsdale in the form of the Vig meets Daily Dos meets the Parlor catch all known as RnR?   Seems to be the case.  Smack in the middle of OT Scottsdale is a piece of Phoenix...sort of.  Is it sexy, you bet, great location, yep - the design is takes a page from all of the latest new places with stone, steel and wood, striving for an industrial yet comfortable feel.  It seems that with a ground up build, more attention could have been paid to flow and energy.  At first glimpse it looks like the place you want to be.   However, where ever I sit I feel like I am not part of the party.  Inside leaves me left out of the small but covered and comfy patio.  Outside leaves me disconnected from the energy of the bar.  And the much ballyhooed upstairs, although very fun and different makes me feel all alone.    The breakfast especially the Chambord French toast and the sundried scramble are absolutley fantastic, but with an Ice Tea, Tax and Tip, I can't escape the place for less than $20 bucks, solo.  MaybeI am cheap but a little much for breakfast.  Lunch and Dinner are solid but nothing to write home about, I did enjoy the grilled cheese.   The beverage menu is pretty impressive and once the servers are trained enough to help me navigate the unique wine list, I might have more fun with it.  The Service sadly comes across as if this part of the equation is an afterthought.  I have had 5 or 6 different servers.  Product and menu knowledge sporadic.  An attitude is hit or miss.  To be fair I have had  some stellar service experiences, but the norm is a perfuntcory at best, mildly interested routine.  I say all this yet I keep going back - 3 stars come from the fact that at this point it is the only place in Scottsdale I can get this Phoenix-like experience.  Ultimately I think there is great potential and I will be rooting for them.    Luckily I live walking distance from The Vig Uptown - Ah Phoenix.",

    "text": "We used to love hanging out at RnR for Sunday Funday, but unfortunately won't be visiting this establishment again after our experience this weekend. First off, we had an AMAZING waitress, her name is Sam! (If you do end up here, get seated with her. She's on top of it and the absolute sweetest.)   Second off, they need a new doorman. Unfortunately he was the beginning of making this a bitter experience for us. I see other reviews here where dress code was a problem and it ended up being one this day as well. A friend tried to meet up with us mid day and was denied entrance for wearing sweatpants on a Sunday. Still looking very put together, might I add. But hey, no exceptions. Cool. He ended up leaving to go back to work.   Less than half an hour later we see a man next to our table dressed in sweatpants. Not put together whatsoever. Like, just rolled out of bed. Naturally this was frustrating. I actually asked the doorman why our friend was denied and this man was allowed in and he said \"That is Bill, he works in our kitchen.\" I said \"He is drinking in sandals...\" to which the doorman replied \"So? He works here. So he can dress however he wants.\"   I have issues with that logic in itself but it turns out, that is not 'Bill from the kitchen'.. he is a random man drinking on a Sunday. We asked to speak to the manager to bring this lapse in judgement to his attention. The manager approaches a short time later and upon our questioning throws up the most defensive and degrading attitude I have ever witnessed from a person in the service industry. I literally had to raise my hand to be acknowledged.   The dress code is; NO Jordan's or high tops, NO camo, NO sweatpants, NO chains. As explained thoroughly and super aggressively by the GM. Meanwhile, a female at the table next to us is decked out in camo, a man down the ways is wearing high tops, and the man behind us in gross sweatpants. I don't mean to bring up racial discrimination as it is clearly a melting pot of ethnicities at RnR, but maybe train your \"security\" to turn away Caucasian folks breaking the dress code too. Instead of telling us he stepped away and someone else must have let them all in, especially after the guy lied to my face about his reasoning. The dude isn't doing his job if that's so common.   Also, Mr. alpha male GM, you may want to attend a managerial class on how to handle situations such as that with kindness and understanding rather than on an escalated degrading power trip. Yelling that you \"can clear this place out\" and \"can fire every single one of these staff members\" is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard a manager say.. We simply wanted a sincere apology that our friend was treated that way by your doorman and to feel that you cared about the consistency of dress code enforcement. You made this the last stop on the planet for us.",

Just make sure that you get there with enough time to make it worth the money because it can be quite busy and hard to get a waitress.   My friend and I were relaxed amidst a crowd of recent college graduates, yelling across the table to hear each other. We were prepared for this. Don't expect quiet during the day. Do expect the frat boys behind you to be absolutely wasted and throw up on the floor. Not the restaurant's fault; I'm just trying to warn you what the crowd is like.   If that's not your scene but you're still dying to try this place, I highly recommend going at night. They have a fantastic reverse happy hour with killer apps! One of my favorite places for spring training games.",

We each got a frozen margarita (pre-made from a machine), after being told their \"Frose\" drink machine wasn't working.  I'll be coming back just to try that - frozen rose champagne and strawberry puree.  We shared their Dirty Chips - if you like sauces, get this.  They drench these house made potato chips in buffalo sauce and a fair amount of ranch/sour cream.  I had their RnR sliders (mini cheeseburgers with bacon), my husband had their slider trio (1 RnR, 1 pulled pork, 1 bacon and bleu cheese).  $31 for all that during HH.  I want to come back and check out the Sunday Brunch as I am on a mad hunt for the best (and cheapest) Bottomless Mimosa bar in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Anybody have any suggestions?",

Imbibe abundantly with classy champagne glasses and then rage-stumble to the diamond.   -Music is great, live DJ's -Great food, considering -Get their gravy on the side: it's chunky, creamy, a tad spicy.. and comforting, everything I want in a gravy. YUM",

    "text": "Hands down the best bloody mary I have ever had. It was the perfect combination of tomato juice, spice, vodka and bacon... yup, bacon!! My friends raved about the mimosas as well.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere at this place. The crowd grew as the day grew later. It never seemed overcrowded. The place was cool and comfortable, but the garage doors and many windows provided an outdoor feel.   The noise level did increase as the day went on (and the drinks were poured). As we were leaving it was difficult to maintain a conversation without shouting, but by that time, we had moved from the 'brunch' crowd into the 'day drinking' crowd. No judgement!   My friends all loved their omelets. Mine was okay. I am not sure if the cheese was off or maybe the fillings but something wasn't right. My friends were shocked when I mentioned this as we were leaving. They all loved the food. I will look forward to trying this spot again the next time I am in town!",

The service isn't always the quickest because it gets so packed (be sure to get there early or you won't get in)! However, the servers are usually fairly nice, and tolerant of being surround by highly intoxicated people. Steve is the best on Sunday's, he has this backpack that he uses to fill up mimosas, although we haven't seen it in a while. They also have great food, it's a good place to grab snacks as well.",

    "text": "My list of requirements for a sports bar is pretty short--attentive servers (particularly behind the bar), lots of TVs; reasonably priced bar food; preferably big space with a couple of team affiliations.  The food prices at RnR seem a little high for Scottsdale, but the beer prices are decent and the space is huge with plenty of large-screen HDTVs.  The servers we had on the two occasions I was there this weekend were always lurking to help with refills, which was nice; I got the impression that RnR caters more to the club/nightlife scene than an actual sports bar scene, so it was an interesting mix of W Hotel clubgoers sunning themselves on the second floor balcony and people in sports jerseys watching NCAA tourney games.  (It helps that there's a DJ spinning loud pop music all the time.)  I'm a fan overall, but don't quote me on that about the food.  The two guys I went with tried the pretzel bites and the fish tacos and both reviews came back as a \"meh.\"",

The drinks were not all that impressive but served their purpose, meaning I felt a little buzz, my head was boppin back n forth to the tunes, I was enjoying myself for the most part. Kinda fun atmosphere with loud, bustling energy abound. The salads actually looked quite delicious, but I wasn't there to eat. The intrigue was enough to return.  2. I then had a surprise birthday party here for my boyfriend and the staff was very accommodating. They reserved the upstairs balcony for our group and served up the birthday cake we brought. They were very, very attentive to our table and came around often with drinks. The service was actually great compare to the experiences others have had here. Tried a couple of bites of someone's sweet potato fries that tasted oh-so delish, but later I came to find it was probably to booze and my fried food frenzy playing tricks on me.  3. We returned for a late dinner the other night and I took a shot at the veggie fare. Veggie Tacos: Well the \"shell\" was thinly sliced jicama, which I can appreciate because I love funky fusion. But this was like $6 for 1 oz of food. Then reminiscing about the sweet potato fries, I ordered a side and was giddy with anticipation until I received a pile of lukewarm lumps. So very sad that a good sweet potato met such a bitter end.  I'll probably end up back here someday and will probably eat sweet potato fries because of my sweet potato problem. But I won't be planning that venture myself.",

Whoever organized the party was able to get them to reserve a large space for all of us and our two waiters did an awesome job of keeping track of the many, many credit cards that were down for the event.   Ridiculously cheap drink specials ($2.50 beers, $3.50 cocktails) all afternoon and a pretty darn tasty burger and fries. All of this was, of course, happy hour prices and my wife and I got out of there thoroughly hammered and no longer hungry for under 50 bucks. I couldn't believe it.   I'm very likely to come back here again.",

He was friendly, hospitable, and gave some of the best service I've had in a long time. Besides his great service, the food was incredible. The dirty chips were taste bud heaven and the chicken sandwich made me drool. If the food and service isn't enough, they give a discount to other people in the industry on Sunday nights. You can't beat RnR for a good time, delicious food, and wonderful service.",

I think I might have to go back and try it again, I have a feeling it would be a great Sunday brunch spot after a heavy hitting night of partying in Oldtown. I know they have mimosa specials, too, which won't hurt.   I went here on a Sunday afternoon to do some trip planning with friends. I will just give you my pros and cons in a list because, well, I'm feeling lazy today and not very eloquent.   Pros:  Sweet potato fries were delish  Pretty extensive wine list  Drink specials for a few things early in the day or at happy hour  Ahi tacos that were very yummy on jicama \"tortilla\"  Pretty crowd  Great building/venue  Breakfast menu looked awesome   Cons:  Server was just kind of blah, not too friendly  Food came out at different times  Drinks that are not on special are pretty pricey  Not as many selections for other meals besides breakfast, mostly sandwiches, etc; nothing stood out as spectacular.   So, as you can tell, my experience wasn't bad enough to keep me away, but it also wasn't great. I think I will give it another go, mostly because their Chambord Pancakes sound AMAZING.   So for now, let's consider this part 1 of 2. I'll be back....",

    "text": "Went here last Sunday, what a horrible experience. There were four tables of two, two people at the bar, and a table of about eight near the back. We were sat down immediately but didn't see a server for about ten minutes. The hostess actually came up and apologized saying the staff was busy (I counted at least 6 servers working, one person per table would have been possible with the staff vs. patron ratio but I digress) and asked if she could get us waters and pass along the word for drinks. I asked for a beergarita, my girlfriend asked for a cider and fireball drink. The hostess returned and apologized saying they were out of the \"mix\" for the cider and fireball. (What mix? It's cider, and Fireball whiskey. But I can't fault her, she was very nice and overly apologetic, and it's not her job to know the menu. I was actually impressed she took the initiative to help out!) She then ordered a beergarita as well.   About ten minutes later our drinks arrived and waiter said \"I'm sorry, the margaritas are supposed to be frozen but our machine broke so I brought them on the rocks.\" Both of us looked at each other a bit stunned that they didn't tell us that our drink would be changed but didn't complain. We drank the drinks (which were not good at all..basically very limey flat beer), and were ignored for about 10 more minutes AFTER being finished with our beverages. The table behind us went to the bar on two separate occasions to complain that there was no service to speak of anywhere, even though we could see the servers on the other side of the restaurant strolling about. I dropped my card on the table and when the server finally came back I asked to be cashed out and he said \"oh, do you want me to get you another round first?\" we said no, we just wanted to leave.   So he returned fairly quickly with the bill and said \"are you sure you don't want to stay a bit longer, I'm sorry about the wait, maybe I can do something for your next round of drinks.\" A valiant effort to try and dig out of an overall bad experience, but if he had recognized that the service/drinks were so bad, why didn't he mention trying to make it up to us BEFORE running the card? Or discounting the already served drinks?  Anyway, I live within walking distance and I will never have any issues walking by to any of the much better establishments in the area.",

They offer it on Saturdays & Sundays from 10am-3pm, you can switch between mimosas and bloodys (because no one wants more than 1 bloody), and they were not stingy with the refills! It was only $20 if you bought an entree, and I'd definitely say I got my money's worth. We sat outside on a hot day, but they had misters and fans which kept it comfortable. They also hack an amazing live DJ playing fun music the entire time. Lastly, I fell in love with my meal. I ordered the Applewood Smoked Bacon Brussel Sprouts Burger with raspberry demi glace, jarisberg cheese, onion jam, and it came on a pretzel bun. 1 word: heaven. I would eat this burger over and over again. I also got the sweet potato tots - totally worth the up charge. They need to bring this brunch place to Wisconsin!",

My group and I got to RnR pretty earlier to get our name on a list and they told us about an hour and a half wait time which I was okay with. I started on my bottomless mimosas and was going to wait until we got seated to order brunch but after two and a half hours had passed I was starving and wondering where our table was. After talking to the waitress I was informed they were told to tell everyone the wait was an hour and a half. Then leading into me asking if she thought we even had a chance at a table (being the second name of 15+ on the list) and she said no. I wish I just had the honesty up front but other than that I loved the place, the vibe, and the food. The bartenders were great and I wish they had these brunch clubs in every state, or at the least the state I'm in currently.  Also a big thanks to Derek",

I could barely talk to my friends I came in with much less order the food. Their deal on the weak bottomless mimosas was highway robbery as it was $32. I must say the food I had which was the turkey scramble was delicious. I can't speak for my friends' food but I'm hoping it was okay. Every time the waitress refilled our weak mimosas she put all the drinks at the front of the tables and then gave us the wrong cup EVERY Time!! So in summary, should you want a place void of conversation with your friends and over priced food with awful customer service, then RnR Gastropub is the place for you.",

Think day partying meets sports spectating on lots of TVs with a DJ mixing upbeat, top hits in the background. Perfect weather 80% of the year allows for this open aired restaurant/bar where you can see out to the street and watch pedestrians and cars pass as you party. Decent food with lots of menu options. All you can drink mimosa specials. Pair all of that with perfect patio seating and people watching some of Scottsdale's finest means you've got one fun, entertaining time!   One of the things I love most about this place is that you will see people of all ages and backgrounds enjoying themselves. Free parking in Old Town Scottsdale is also a big plus. Jump on one of the \"free\" ($10 minimum) golf carts and you can hit up a plethora of other bars and clubs to get the rest of your Sunday funday bar crawling on!",

Granted this was because it was St Paddy's Day and they would not have made money off of people drinking bottomless of those. While we were waiting for a table we hand a pretty good spot at the bar to keep the drinks flowing in the meantime.   Our food was great...once we finally got a table. We started with the Hangover Fries...yummmyyyyyy was just what we needed to kick off our day because we were starving because of the busy St Pad's crowd. For my meal, I got the Grilled Buffalo Chicken Sandwich...it was the perfect amount of heat but it was just a little messy. If the buffalo sandwich is a hit in my mind I would get it again if something else doesn't catch my eye. This is a sandwich I would most certainly get again. Other meals on the table included: the Breakfast Taco Plate, Turkey Burger & the Pulled Pork Sandwich. All of which looked delish!  Will try to go again this time for the bottomless special!",

When we arrived there was only 10 chairs set up and we had to move things around ourselves to cramp the additional 5 chairs needed.  Then when the food starting coming out they realized they had served us the food for the table next to us. The waiter was extremely rude and pulled the plate from under my cousin literally when he was already eating it. We told her it was not our mistake but we would pay for we had already consumed. That is when she set the plate back down. She was very unprofessional.  We were also seated right next to the kitchen, so when a server was walking by with a stack of plates, she spilled an entire container of ranch all over the birthday girl and 2 chairs. I made her aware of what she did and didn't even apologize. We had to ask for a manager at this point and he just gave her a free drink. They handed me a rag and I had to clean up the chairs and table myself.  We of course made the best of the situation but their customer service was ridiculous. I understand that they must deal with tons of drunk people every weekend, which can not be easy, but that is not an excuse to me.",

We didn't even get asked if we wanted to wait inside and order drinks.  I understand it was bottomless mimosas Sunday, and it was busy, but I don't understand why they couldn't seat a table of 8 in around 45 minutes. We checked again at an hour and a half, and there were 8 tables in front of us still waiting.  I saw several tables being used by people who were just drinking. I don't understand why they couldn't prioritize clients who were willing to spend on eating and drinking.  Anyways, not worth the wait. Go across the street to Salty Senorita's, save the time and get better service (without the eye rolls from the hostesses).   Also, I'm disappointed this is a Giants bar.

    "text": "I was visiting with my sister and her friend over bottomless mimosas on a Sunday morning at RnR. Later on they made a trip to the restroom and while they were away (five to ten minutes) a bouncer tried to kick me out for being 'too intoxicated' at 2pm... mind you I was only two or three mimosas in. Despite trying to explain that the numerous drinks around me were belonged to my friends, he put his hand on my back and forced me to leave with him. As I'm being escorted out the door my sister and her friend catch up with us and the guard lets me go. He was very apologetic but refused to explain why he thought I was too intoxicated. Apparently a guy can't stand around in that place unattended by babes for more than five minutes.",

The waitress didn't write down any of our 3 orders and kept returning to double check what our orders were. When we received our food in a timely matter, each of the orders had something wrong with them, but the sangria was very good!   I ordered the Southwest burger cooked medium well. What I got was not medium well at all, check the photo! It was THAT rare throughout the entire burger. When I told the general manager about it, he acted as if he could not care less that the meal was dangerously messed up. He informed me that he would let the kitchen know in a rather unenthused tone and that was all. I apologized for taking his time.   Would I return? Not after the way the manager treated such a mess up. The burger was clearly 3 stages from medium well. I wouldn't even go back for the sangria.",

    "text": "10/01/13  Came in to use a Local Dines certificate expiring tonight.  It being a Tuesday, I could've taken advantage of their bruschettas, cheese and charcuterie plates, and beverage specials (wine and other beverages) offered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 7p to close, but since I had a discounted certificate, I had to postpone trying these out until another time.  Instead, I decided to check out a couple of RnR's burgers and a pint of Angry Orchard cider ($6).  The cider was served very cold (perfect after I slipped a koozie on the glass) and tasted \"mah-velous, absolutely mah-velous!\"  Server Sibby/Siby was friendly and upbeat, as well as patient with all my questions regarding the food and beverage menus, as well as a few concerns I had regarding ingredients on a few dessert items.  Not once did she make me feel like I was a burden.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask to be seated at her tables!  Not only was Sibby a delight to have as a server, but she was also a great help in steering me towards the right direction when I asked her which of the two was better, sweet potato fries or tots (she said tots; I asked if I could go half-and-half, and she said yes) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=8z6nhnprgC3psPCRuAiH-Q#8z6nhnprgC3psPCRuAiH-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>, as well as my checking out the Bacon Brussels Burger, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=46gN0ZHqMW8--oYt-Y5I_w#46gN0ZHqMW8--oYt-Y5I_w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a> which would still taste great without the raspberry demi glace (which contained cornstarch, an ingredient I'm allergic to).  This burger tasted wonderful!  Made with jarlsberg cheese, applewood bacon, fried Brussels sprouts, onion jam, and a pretzel bun, this burger was definitely sweeter in flavor (due to the toastiness of the sprouts, as well as the addition of the onion jam- heaven!) and made for an agreeable contrast after the few bites I had of the Southwest Burger.  The salty (but in a good way!), pleasing number consisted of pepperjack cheese, chopped green chiles, smoked bacon, crispy onion straws, and a garlic aioli, nestled in a challah bun.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=sWWUYOIEaqrmxOe2hqpzfg#sWWUYOIEaqrmxOe2hqpzfg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>  I had to opt out of the guacamole, but I didn't think it suffered from its absence.  As for the parmesan fries that came with the second burger, I didn't care much for them, because one, they weren't very flavorful, despite the addition of the parmesan, and two, the presentation wasn't as nice as it could've been, and had they tasted great, the presentation would not have mattered.  Next time, I'm going with lots and lots of sweet potato tots!",

I'm ready to pack up and go to her small town and see if everyone that lives there is as friendly and cute as her. Management you are definitely lucky to have a server  like Sydney on staff.  I eat out every meal pretty much and have for the last 30 years and she is up there with the top of the top.  I'm a Diet Coke drinker and she never left my glass more then 1/2 empty and would constantly greet us with a smile  I had a turkey burger which was wonderful and looked so good  took a picture of it for Snapchat and I never snap food tasted great too.  I don't think I've ever had brussels sprouts at a restaurant but damn these were good.  My friend had the shrimp tacos and I'm still pissed off she didn't give me a bite they look really good  We will definitely be back and it was just day 1  of this years Giants spring-training thanks for flying the world champion Giants flags to each month of March  Oh and one more thing if you could make Sydney follow me back on Instagram that be great :)",

Thick cut bacon, medium cooked burger, all in a pretzel bread bun; so savory! I couldn't taste the brussels sprouts. But the pretzel bread, I could eat that by itself! For my side, I had parmesan fries, which were just as good.   The margaritas are great, especially at half off which was about $4. I wouldn't pay $8 for them; too small a glass for that price.

    "text": "I really wish I would have found this place earlier. I have to say it's my new favorite bar. Our first visit was on a Thursday early morning, the place was pretty quiet. We sat at a table on the patio. It seemed really laid back and casual, the service wasn't too quick. The food was good, but my boyfriends orange juice was rancid. They are supposed to have fresh orange juice so I don't know if it was from a different day or what, but it was pretty gross. I felt bad that my boyfriend actually took a drink from it. And at the same time was super relieved I went with coffee that morning or I would never have gone back. Needless to say we weren't too impressed with the place but thought we'd give it a second chance. The next time we went, we sat at the bar and had a great time. The bartender gave great service and made great food recommendations. We got the bbq pork sliders, which are amazing and their sweet potato tots. We tried it out again for breakfast and I even dared to order the bottomless mimosa (after the OJ nightmare the first time) and they were good. Although, from a bartenders perspective, I recommend to drink at least 5 to get your moneys worth. All the food we've ordered has been pretty good, because of the plates it seems like small portions but they are actually decent sized. Now every time we've been there has been the same. Great atmosphere, love both the patios, good service, and good food.",

    "text": "Stopped in on a weekday after dark awhile back to have some dinner on a Local Dines deal. I requested a patio seat and we were put on the rail near the street. 1st mistake...the traffic from the street was pretty noisy and not really conducive to conversation. 2nd mistake...the lighting on the patio was so dim, I had to hold the menu so the street light would illuminate it. I know, I know, I'm old and can't see as well as I used to but, I still have to eat for goodness sakes! Maybe a candle on the table would have been helpful. I ordered the Ahi Tacos and was warned by the waitress they were very small - no problem, not that hungry and I'm enjoying one or two of their tasty draft beers. The tacos were good but the tuna could have been a little more rare and it was drowned in the sauce which would have also been good in a lesser quantity. My husband got the burger which he enjoyed and ordered the Bacon Brussels as a side. The brussels were the best thing about the experience that evening. From the other reviews, I'm guessing maybe I should have chosen to visit at breakfast on the weekend instead??? Anyway the service was good, the food and drinks were good, just not impressive for the prices. I expect food in Scottsdale to amaze me with all the competition they have near Old Town. If they had breakfast/brunch all day on the weekends I might be able to make it. I just hate getting up early on my days off.",

Decided to give it a go this past Sunday with my boyfriend and my son for lunch/brunch.   Huge error in judgment.  If you love loud music where you can't hear yrself speak and love crowds go there on a Sunday.  My only hope is that I will be able to go during the week for a 'quieter' lunch to use this groupon.  My take on this place without having eaten there - catering to the 21-30 crowd and probably not interested in being a serious restaurant (where people actually choose to go eat not just to people watch).  Looking for a good place to eat with solid service, nice atmosphere and good food - Italian grotto, 2 blocks north on scottsdale.",

    "text": "So I am writing this review after trying the restaurant out 3 times now.   1st Experience: I was with a Bachelorette Party on St. Patrick's Day 2010 and we stopped into RnR. The bartender was friendly & we had great service. Overall a good experience in the 30-45 minutes we were there for a drink & a shot at the bar.   2nd Experience: A friend and I decided to try out there bottomless Mimosa's for $10 one Sunday morning. I recall the Animal fries being tasty & the mimosa's were alright. Nothing special, but worth the money as long as you had 2 or more. The service was so-so. Overall a fairly good experience.  3rd & Final Experience: I can honestly say that today we had the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant in my 27.5 years on this third rock from the sun. To begin, we sat at our table on the patio for 30 minutes before I finally called the hostess over to see if we even had a server for our table. She informed us that there was & she went to find the server. After 5 or 10 minutes she comes back and informed us that they are \"swamped\" and that she will be taking our drink order for the server. Mind you this was lunch on a Thursday afternoon. This place wasn't anywhere near \"swamped\". She brings us our waters and informs us a few minutes later that she will also be taking our food order & that she will pass it on to our server whom we still have not seen at this point. As she starts to take our order our server finally shows up at the table. He apologizes and takes our order. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time & the order was correct. Nobody brought us silverware, so I had to request it. Then I realized there was no salt or pepper on our table so instead of letting my food get cold while I waited for our server to reappear, I asked the table next to us if we could borrow theirs. Our water glasses were left empty for 15-20 minutes. And it took forever for our server to bring us our check after we requested it and then it took him equally as long to pick up the check with our payment inside it. I was in absolute shock that nobody offered us a complimentary beverage, appetizer, or dessert for the horrible serve we received which they were completely aware of considering how they kept apologizing. We paid our full $27 bill & left... Our lunch didn't just cost us money, it cost us almost 3 hours of our afternoon. I will not be returning to this establishment.",

    "text": "RnR I tried to like you, I really did.  I've lived in Scottsdale for a few years now so I am used to the restaurant/night club/trendy spot but I just couldn't get into RnR.  I've been there for dinner several times and didn't enjoy myself.  The place is loud, the food mediocre and the service ranges from good to plain awful.  Nothing on the menu ever really grabbed my attention so I had the Rock shrimp appetizer and a side of Parmesan fries.  My two dinner-mates each ordered a sandwich with fries as well.  My rock shrimp were ok, nothing to write home about and my side of $6 fries was tiny.  My friend's side of fries on their sandwiches was a larger portion than the side I paid extra for.    Before I wrote the place off, I wanted to stop by for breakfast since I had heard about their endless mimosa and blood mary special.  The special is a little confusing, if you aren't ordering a breakfast entree it $25 but if you do order an entree it is $15.  Our server was busy that morning but also was very spaced out.  Forgot to bring our joiner a water or silverware and was very non-existent.  The place was a little busy so I wanted to cut him some slack but he never wrote down our orders and then would come back to clarify on what we had ordered because he forgot.  The endless special seemed like a good deal until I realized they didn't make each refill on your mimosa but came around with a pitcher of pre mixed mimosas so some tasted like just OJ and some like a weak mimosa.  My friend who had the endless bloody enjoyed his deal, each bloody was a little different made each time (once with a slice of bacon, once with bacon bits, once with no bacon at all) but all in all thought it was a good for the price.  My $3 cup of coffee was not refilled, even when I requested.  The food on the menu was a different story.  I ordered the 3 breakfast tacos and requested a side of hash browns instead of home fries.  Our waiter didn't write down my order so of course it arrived with home fries but the food runner was happy to bring me the side of hash browns.  My friends enjoyed their build your own burritos but my food was subpar.  My tacos were greasy and lacked flavor.  Every time I picked up my taco for a bite, grease ran out the bottom.  Even my potato and egg taco was greasy and flavorless.  The hash browns were soggy and covered in cooking grease as well.  I'm all for a greasy spoon hang over breakfast but this was over board.  The server was happy to oblige our request for separate checks but again because he failed to write down our order, all our checks were wrong but by this time we were ready to leave so we paid what he gave us and left.    The people watching WAS amazing.  It was noon on a Sunday and there were girls in full make up and going out clothes (not walk of shame either) and d-bags galore.  If I wanted to start a drinking game at RnR it would be drink when ever some dude in a plaid shirt high fives another dude.",

A group of us on a Sunday bike ride (the pedal kind) had a pit stop there and for some reason they have happy hour every day of the week - except Sundays.  Spring training season was over so the place was barely a quarter full on a lazy afternoon.  It's a nice place, but 3 domestic beers + tax/tip cost $18.   I'd expect to pay that at a club at night, but it's not a place I'd stop by again during the day for a casual bev with friends.  For some reason, a lot of Old Town places don't seem to realize there's a big difference between the day crowd and the night crowd.",

    "text": "Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend.  The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table.  Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.  RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!",

I loved the setup of the patio and inside bar, especially because there were plenty of tv's to catch Selection Sunday. The prices seemed a little high but it is in Scottsdale. I ordered the RnR burger. The bacon was thick and flavorful but the hamburger tasted and looked like it had been frozen.  As I was eating I thought the burger and fries at Zipps was better and less expensive. Although the drinks seemed expensive, they did include a double shot. Our waitress was friendly but seemed pre-occupied and had a hard time keeping our order straight. She ended up bringing us an extra iced tea and mixed drink the bar made, but seemed to disappear when we needed her. Even if the service were great I don't know if I'd make it a point to go back based on the food and price of the drinks.",

The food is good and they have decent beer on tap, that's why they get two stars, but the service is AWFUL.  You should not have to wait 10 minutes for someone to take your drink order, especially when it isn't busy and when the Suns are playing you should have that on TV, not hockey.",

    "text": "Like Nathan M., this review is for the lack of service and not the food as we didn't make it that far.  My boyfriend and I came in yesterday afternoon for lunch.  The host was friendly enough, we sat at a table on the 2nd floor patio.  It really is a great looking place, open, industrial, \"hip\".  That is where the positives stop.  We waited about 15 minutes for our server to show up, who then took our drink order and ran away before we could say we were ready to order our food.   He seemed very disinterested.  10 minutes later my iced tea was dropped off hastily with no mention of my bf's beer, he said he'd be back to take our order as he was walking away from our table.  Another 10 minutes passed, still no beer and \"our server\" reappears to take our food order.   We asked to start with the artichoke dip, to which we were told \"we're out\".  I asked for a ceasar salad, the bf a burger.  After we ordered, we realized that the server didn't ask which side we wanted with the burger.  We both realized at this point that we just needed to get the hell out of there.  We dropped $3 on the table for my iced tea and headed to Sonic.",

Kristen and I stopped by RnR the other day for a late lunch and happened to get there just in time for happy hour, my beer was less than her tea, awesome. I love the look of the place, the front door is huge and sweet, and while the inside is on the smaller side, it doesn't feel packed, and there is ample seating outside, I can't wait for the cooler weather so we can stop by more often and people watch.      We started with two appetizers, the pigs in a blanket, which are the old childhood favorite with a light and flaky pastry crust, they were delicious, and the chicken lollipops, super tender on the bone chicken with buffalo sauce, so stinking good. We then shared the pork sandwich, which had a sweet and tangy sauce that complimented the tender pork wonderfully, it was a terrific sandwich and came with a bucket of fries.      With crazy hours, good drink selections and a great happy hour, RnR is definitely worth checking out, I wish I had came here sooner.",

There was a group of guys partying it up big time at one table, so it was a pretty lively atmosphere. Real mix of folks, some older who had just gone to the game and some of the college age including a few not old enough to drink. Good beer selection decided not to do a margarita though they boast a good recipe. Had a Southwest Burger with sweet potato fries, that's a $14 burger. Pretty hardy meal and the fries were pretty tasty. Burger probably a little overpriced but was a good choice. Waitress was on the ball, would definitely make a return trip.",

The menu was small for breakfast, but whatever as long as i get some food.  The bartender ask us what we like to drink, then she ask if we wanted to keep it open.....  Well, we're having food here! She continue to ask for credit card.  Really?!! I understand if it was sat. night at a bar, but it's Sunday morning and you can keep your eyes on your bar so people won't walk off?!  Breakfast was limited, so i order a Grill Cheese Sandwich.  The bartender came back and said they're not serving lunch just yet.  Come on its a Grill Cheese!  and if you're just serving breakfast put a time on there so everyone would know.  Some how he talked them into it.  Let just say that i won't be in there anytime soon.   Top it off the bill came out wrong too....",

The scene is really good, lots of good looking people in their mid 20s - mid 30s. It's definitely a loud place for dinner because there's a DJ and a lot of people hanging around at the bar. I ordered the baked brie and the grilled cheese and both were amazing! (Yes, I clearly have a cheese problem.) Our server was a little clueless but really friendly and nice. The menu has something for everyone which is nice - salads, sandwiches, sliders, tacos, etc. This is definitely a good place to go with a small group before heading out for the night.",

    "text": "While I will go on record saying it is unfair to rate any new restaurant. I must defend my new favorite place RNR!!!  I have been to RNR for both dinner and lunch since it opened.  The building as others have mentioned is awesome. Much needed breath of fresh air in Old Town along Scottsdale Road.    The food in my experience is very very good and items on the menu are unique just like the building.  The Lollipoops are excellent and a great idea. The grilled cheese with the bacon they use was excellent as well.   The Mussells were cooked to perfection and the Pork sandwich again was great.  Next time I go I have to try a burger as they looked awesome on the table next to me.   I was there on Saturday after the Giants Spring Training game.  People let's remember something. RNR as a restaurant is less than a week old and it's BRAND NEW building.  I think anyone who has ever purchased a new home can relate to the headaches they must have not to mention being a new restaurant with a menu nobody has seen or worked with before.    Old Town had Giants game as well as some  Art Walk  happening on Saturday as well as  Sunday.  I went to a few different place on Saturday afternoon and EVERYTHING in Old Town was a nightmare!!!  Should I rip Dos Gringo's stand in the ballpark because I had to wait in a line for 20 mins inside game for a can of beer to be poured in a plastic cup?? Do I rip the Volunteers at the game because my hot dog was nasty??   It took me 30 mins to get a cab 3 hours after the game let out.  Old Town was a Zoo this weekend get over it people and use some common sense.    I can't wait to go back to RNR once the full menu is released.  Rather than be like a couple of others who have complained it's a limited menu or they don't have full menu yet  I applaud them for delaying the full menu.  That shows me they want to get things right and the kinks fixed before they release it. As for me?  I love the place and the food  I will be visting again and again.",

There were multiple hosts waiting to greet us at the front door.   Right off the bat, we were impressed.  The patio is gorgeous, both upstairs and downstairs.  The booths are large and roomy, and I liked the long table next to the bar that can be used for couples or large parties.  They have an amazing wine cabinet, if you can call it that, more like a wine wall, that I'm trying to convince my boyfriend we need in our house.   We decided to go with the Apple & Gorgonzola salad and the Chicken Sandwich...the chicken sandwich has brie, basil pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes, nothing short of amazing.  As for the salad, they use a prickly pear vin, which pairs sinfully well with it. :)  Just the right amount or gorgonzola, not overpowering at all. He went with Blue Moon on tap and I chose Sangre de Toro for my wine.  We've been drinking Toro at home for years, and it's the first time I've seen it out and about at a bar.  Instant plus. Overall, we had a great time, and the price wasn't bad at all!  I was expecting to pay much more for what we received.  RnR...we're fans!  We can't wait to go back!",

The bar staff is somewhat attentive but seems to be more preoccupied with spinning glasses than serving drinks in a timely fashion.  One bartender broke a glass right in front of me while flipping it.  The staff seemed inexperienced and not well trained. I repeatedly watched the bartenders scoop ice out of the ice bins with a pint glass, its just a matter of time before someone ends up with a glass chip in their drink.     The waiter I had took almost ten minutes to greet us. He showed up with no menus or drink lists but expected us to know what we wanted once he finally showed up.  He was pleasant enough but again just not super sharp.  The look of the place is pretty cool. The patio is sweet and I love the decor for the most part.  I noticed some other \"restaurant rip offs\" like the gum bullseyes that Postino has at their wine bars.  Everyplace doesn't need to be super original but some things are blatant and show no imagination.   All in all I was not impressed. This place needs some real direction and fine tuning.",

For food we just snacked on the Chicken lollipops which were great good flavor and a nice spice to the sauce.  Also we got the ahi tuna tacos which I thought were awesome.  They had great flavor and you got 5 per plate.  They were cold and the jimica taco shell was a nice crunch and change from the usual taco.

The hostess was very nice asked where we wanted to be seated as the inside was pretty full but it was pretty chilly outside and she could not find us seating for 4 with a heater that was working.  The upstairs was closed but we did see people seating up there.....so we waited.  She was ready to seat us and a foursome decided it was too cold outside and they took our seat inside.  The hostess told us to wait, but we left.    I couldn't wait to take my brother here as he is a chef in the Cape Cod area and read some of the Yelps reviews so I thought this would be a great place to lunch after the farmers market.  Anyhow, you don't let customers leave you make it happen especially when you have all of upstairs open.  This place will never know how much we spend here on lunch for 4 or the review it could of been.",

I can come up with. He's a rock star.  Food, always impressive. Bottomless mimosas? I think so. Atmosphere? On point. I haven't been here outside of brunch but I'm sure it's just as wonderful when it's slow. Cheers!",

It's a nice bar/sports bar type feel with well appointed patio seating.  We sat outside all 4 times we came here because the weather was perfect.  Here's what we ordered:  Bottle of Santa Martina Red Blend, $26 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A#nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>  RnR Sliders, $9 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg#hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>  Bacon Brussels Burger, $15 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw#c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ#KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>  Southwest Burger, $13 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg#5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>  Bleu Cheese Burger, $13  Animal Fries  Hangover Fries  Nachos, $10 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A#hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-...</a>  The Burgers here are really good.  Out of all of them, my favorite was the Southwest Burger...very good and juicy.  The Nachos were above average.  They use a healthy dose of Queso Cheese and it's pretty good.  The Animal Fries is nothing like the In-n-Out version....it's a huge pile of BBQ Pork on top of the Fries....very good and can easily feed 3 people.  The Hangover Fries was very unique....a little Egg on top of Cheesy Fries...yum!  The food here was the highlight because the service here is not that good.  During all 4 visits we had issues with slow service.  During one visit, we were seated at our table and it took 15 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order....we were very close to leaving.  Because it's not easy to park and get here, it would've been a hassle to leave and go somewhere else, so we stuck around.  If they can improve their service, they'll have a good chance to make this a special spot in my mind.  Some other random notes/tips:  - There's an ATM in the back near the Men's restroom if you need cash.  It's kind of an odd spot for it.  - Parking sucks, especially when there's a farmers market down there....they close off the parking structure in the back for the market so you're left to find street parking or park around the corner in one of the healthcare lots, which you're not supposed to do.  - There's plenty of TV's and this place is an awesome spot to watch sports.  - I really like the music they play here.  The nights we were there, they played upbeat house music....love it.  Overall, I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars but rounding up to 4 because I think it has so much potential.  If the service continues to suck, I'll have to drop it.  Return Factor - 80%",

A table had been left to be bussed for so long that an adequate amount of flies began to live on it. My friend ordered a pizza from local pizza shop and had it delivered before the wait staff even asked to take our food or der. When waitress did come over to check on us, she walked away while we were still talking to her. We did order drinks from this place and the waitress came over and told us we had to cash out because she was trying to leave. Then the register system must be super complicated because it took three of em to cash out one check. Waitresses try too hard to look cute. Waiters are cute tho. Just the right amount of stubbly facial hair. Mmhmm. But the wait staff is too into themselves to notice customers. I feel if i were to take one home, they would only watch themeslves in the mirrors around my bed. All in all, i would return because i enjoy the scenery and waiting for things gave me plenty of time to look around.",

The TV was set to hockey closest to our tables that we reserved and waited for three hours to get which is OK and I have no problem with. However, it was clearly football Sunday. I politely asked for the TV to be changed to football and the hostess said that it was the servers responsibility that they could not do anything. When I asked the server to change it to the football game she asked which game... I told her the playoff game. The whole bar was wearing nothing but Packers and Cowboy gear. Clearly I the manager on duty did not prep his staff for the day ahead or the staff waitresses were not privy to sports working in a sports bar. The waitress literally had no urgency to tend to our needs and I ordered every drink from the bartender at the bar rather than our waitress. Terrible service if that's what they call it.",

    "text": "You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and there you have...a 3 star review. RnR isn't overall mediocre. There's good aspects, and not good aspects, and that's why I'm giving it an A-OK review.   I've been wanting to stop in RnR since I moved back to AZ. I had heard it was a good HH & brunch spot so a group of us stopped in the morning after a pretty debauchorous Friday night. From what I understand this place is always crowded for weekend brunch, but I should point out this was the morning of Pat's Run in Tempe so this place was PACKED.  Here's what I liked:    The atmosphere & $10 all you can drink mimosas. I just moved back to AZ about a year ago from San Francisco and this place kind of reminded me of a lot of places there. It's hard to find weekend brunch spots in Scottsdale/Phoenix that do all you can drink mimosas (there's a lot of places that offer deals of some sort, but not all you drink), so I'm glad RnR does it.   I like the layout of RnR. Both the patio & inside are nice, and I like the huge tables for big groups. There's a shade that can be pulled down to separate the inside and outside or it can be left open, which gives the place a roomier feel.   Here's what I didn't like:  The food & the DJ playing at 10 am. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit and it really wasn't all that good. The sausage tasted like it was a frozen patty heated up in the microwave and the eggs were really overcooked. This biscuit it was served on was really good, though. It also came w/a side of potatoes that were kind of cold.   As far as the DJ in the morning...I mean, I don't mind that this place was crowded, but I don't wanna feel like I'm at a club when the sun is out. Granted, after a couple glasses of champagne things were more bearable (okay, maybe even fun with some of the older hip-hop being played), but at the end of the day I could have done without the loud music in the morning.   For how crowded RnR was  I thought the service was good. We waited MUCH longer than we were told for a table (and we were already told a very long time), but like I said it was REALLY crowded due to Pat Run's so giving people wait times was probably a total crapshoot.   I still want to try RnR for happy hour. And honestly, despite that not-so-good food and loud music I'd probably come back for brunch as long they're serving up $10 all you drink mimosas.",

    "text": "RnR is a casual but trendy restaurant. It does a great job reimagining the former space, which may have been a warehouse. I liked how the garage door to what may have been the loading dock area is the entrance to the outdoor seating area from inside the restaurant. The restaurant also has an upstairs seating area and lounge seating area on the bottom floor toward the back of the restaurant. Since I'm from the Bay, I was loving the SF Giants flag over the bar.   I can totally see RnR being the hot spot for brunch. The music was loudly blasting top 40 hits, and at 10am you can buy bottomless mimosas or bloody marys. There are TV's everywhere, so this would also be a great spot for watching sports. Sunday Funday or Shitshow Sunday? Decide your fate.   Loved the place, but I was super disappointed with my order. I ordered the breakfast tacos plate, which included potato + egg taco, bacon + egg taco, and chorizo + egg taco. All 3 tacos have cheddar in them. The food was basic AF. I can't believe I spent money on food I not only could have easily made at home but could have made so much better. The tacos were exactly as they were advertised, so I guess it was my bad for expecting them to be anything more. No creativity whatsoever, and the tacos lacked flavor or saltiness. Even the taco with chorizo tasted bland to me despite chorizo generally being flavorful. The side of salsa that came with the tacos had no kick to it. I had to drench the tacos in hot sauce, which I think was Cholula. It's kind of sad when the side of fried potatoes, bell peppers, and onion was the best thing on the whole plate. I'm hoping that I just chose wrongly, so I won't totally count out RnR next time I'm in Scottsdale.",

RnR has made its way deep into the corridors of my heart and stomach by providing good wine, amazing food, great service and optimal people watching from the upstairs balcony.   After the Giants game (beating Cleveland!) we hopped onto one of the handy dandy golf carts and headed into downtown Scottsdale to join other Giants fans as we reveled in the glory of a well-earned win. Not knowing the town, we left it up to our chauffeur to drop us at the perfect location of RnR.   There are three bars strategically placed throughout the massive building. We opted for the bar upstairs on the balcony overlooking the street so that we can watch the cars, golf carts and people making their way down this bustling thoroughfare. As I walked by one of the tables, I spied and smelled a delicacy that was a must order for me - Animal Fries. Parmesan fries mixed with sweet potato fries, smothered with cheese and topped with BBQ pork. Delicious!!!!  We left here and went to two other bars in town, but RnR was my favorite. Come for the good food, great service and awesome people watching.",

I had the Kale Ceasar Salad and added Blackened Salmon! The Damon was cooked perfectly and the kale and romaine mix salad was fresh and crispy. The Ceasar dressing is so good I asked for an extra side!   My hubby had the RnR Burger with bacon and cheese and the flavor was full and well seasoned! I love a good burger and this place definitely did not disappoint.   For drinks I had their classic frozen margarita which was perfect consistency with a good amount of \"kick\"!  Definitely would recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or just drinks with friends! Sit in the patio and enjoy the views of Old Town Scottsdale. Ask for \"Steve\" he's AMAZING!!! Very attentive and stays on top of his job!",

    "text": "Verdict: RnR is completely accurate for this place... right up until about lunch time.   After late morning, you won't be doing any resting, relaxing, recuperating, etc. here. I guess what I'm saying is the place gets packed and they really crank the music. Maybe the Rs stand for rock & recreation but on to the gastro and pub. That's why we're all here, right?  I'd certainly recommend the burrito. I'd also recommend every breakfast food I saw coming out of the kitchen. Everything looked great and my friends confirmed it tasted just as good. If you're looking to start drinking early, there's a nice deal on unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. You also get a breakfast entre because they don't want you only having tons of alcohol without any food in your system. More on that later.  While my friends loaded up on their unlimited mimosas and bloody marys, I went for the BYO breakfast burrito. Being a good NM boy, I had to go with the green chile pulled pork. Also got the bacon, potato, onion, and brie. The only thing I'd change was the cheese. Brie is excellent but the flavor couldn't come through with all the other ingredients. There were plenty of potatoes with onions and peppers on the side.  You might find that some patrons go overboard with the unlimited early morning drinks. There were at least two people who got sick in the bathroom during our visit to the gastropub. They made quite the mess but the bathroom attendant cleaned everything up quickly. I was wondering why they had an attendant and I guess that answered the question.",

Got absurd attitude from the hostesses, waitress was ok but service was way slower than in the past. Got jalapeno Mac and cheese and it was blatantly the normal Mac, no apologies or offer to correct. Ordered something else, of course the Mac was still on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed even though it obviously only had one bite taken out of it. Portion was way smaller and quality has gone down. Very douche baggy vibe. Good place to go if you want to be treated like shit and get mediocre food and service. Were given our bill before we asked for it and told we could still get mimosa refills but then stopped getting refills. Had to go up to the bar. Waitress gave herself double gratuity on the bill so make sure you check your bill if you're going with a large group and gratuity is included. Bottomless mimosa deal is great but with all the other options around, will be skipping this place in the future.",

I got these amazing little tiny ahi tacos, they were so fresh, so awesome. I wish I would have taken a pic as the menu description is super descriptive, but not what you imagine you are getting....they are better!  These are literally one to two bites max but soooo worth it! I seriously could eat like twelve. The chicken lollipops in honey jalapeno sauce are amazing. They are soooo good! My boyfriend gets those everytime. He introduced me this fine, fun establishment it has yet to be a let down.   Service staff, well some of the staff can be None/non existent or brain dead so just a heads up, don't go here on a time crunch or a short fuse. The food, atmosphere and drinks are great though. Just be aware that occaisonally there is a farmer's market located in the parking lot, therefore, there is no parking that is convienent on those particular Sundays....cheers :)",

The biggest downside is when it's busy on the weekends (it is jam packed between those hours) it's extremely hard to get drink orders from your server (I.e. refilling the bottomless mimosas) & if you manage to get an order in it will certainly take 10 minutes for the drink. Nonetheless, we return and will continue returning for the party!",

So we went back towards downstairs, until we were hunted down by one of the servers for the upstairs portion, who broke up a table and made somewhere for us to sit. That was pretty good service!  I had their version of a chambord margarita and a beer. The rita was pretty good, not like the ones at Ztejas, a little more tart. It was tasty. Since I did not eat, I cannot comment on the food, but I would totally come back for breakfast looking at the menu.   The atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff friendly.... but my friend and I found one thing very funny. All of the male staff wear these like low v-neck shirts. We found it kind of funny. We were wondering if waxing your chest was part of the job description. Just something we noticed.  When I actually eat there I will update my review.",

Also, the space is very appealing. I love their outdoor patio on the first floor, and how roomy the interior is. I had never been upstairs until my most recent visit, but that is a good place to sit if your group wants to be a little more private. I'm giving a fourth star because my server, Cassie, was awesome. She made sure that everyone in my group always had a full mimosa, and took great care of us by starting individual tabs for everyone so that we could move around the table and restaurant easily. I'd never had a waitress take our credit cards at the beginning of the meal, but it made so much sense after our group was on mimosa #5 and we were running downstairs to request songs from the DJ and mingle with our friends sitting at tables on the first floor.",

The sweet potato fries were good, parmesan fries not so much- they are bland fries with parmesan powder poured on them, not very good at all.  The sliders were okay, again, nothing special.

Inside and outside the restaurant there were plenty of TVs going with the latest March Madness games. It did take a little longer than expected to be helped once we were seated, but after that everything else was fine, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  I had the seared ahi tacos. The portions were a little small (although I guess it was under the small platter section), but they were still very tasty.  If yelp offered it, I would give RnR 3.5 stars.

    "text": "Went in with a group on Monday around 1pm. The place wasn't busy at all, so I was expecting service to be pretty speedy. WRONG! We waited almost 10 minutes for our drinks to be delivered. One persons drink didn't even come, so after another 10 minutes of our server being nowhere, he magically appeared and ordered him another one. 5 minutes later, I personally had to go grab it from the bar because our server was nowhere to be found again.   after ordering, it took about 35 minutes for our food to come out. A buddy and I split the Blue Cheese Sliders and the Hangover Fries. The sliders came out with no blue cheese on them and the fries looked and tasted like they had been sitting under the heat-lamp for about 10 minutes. And again, our server was nowhere to be found when we needed drink refills and to ask about the food.   To top it off, a few in our group decided to sit at the bar after our meal and wait for our ride to come. We all ordered beers from their amazing CRAFT selection (Coors Light, Blue Moon, Dos Equis, Alaskan Amber, New Castle, Perroni). Wow, those all sound like domestics to me.   As we were drinking our beers, we noticed that the bar was swarming with FLY's! EVERYWHERE! Flies and Gnats were on everything; the plates, glasses, bottles, the beer taps.   This place is to be avoided at all cost. It may look good on the outside but everything on the inside is messed up. This is coming from someone who has worked a while in the food industry.   Service - 1.5/5 Food - 2/5 Cleanliness - 1.5/5 Atmosphere - 3/5",

And if this review was for my first experience at the restaurant, it would probably be just a couple stars.  It was completely chaotic, the service was pretty marginal and extremely slow, and they hadn't released the full menu yet so the food was very limited.  However, I convinced myself to go back a few different times and have definitely grown to really like the place.  Although at times, as others have mentioned, it can be so over-packed that you feel like a sardine, hitting up the restaurant for lunch or breakfast has always been pretty relaxing.  The breakfast was awesome (definitely go for the chambord french toast)  and lunch was pretty typical.  But you can't beat sitting on the balcony with a beer.  A+ for that!  Happy hour at RnR, although it can be stress-inducingly crowded, actually offers some sweet deals on drinks and wine (half off glass and bottles on Mondays!).  I would say one of these 4 stars is for the location and setting, while the food and service should get a solid 3.",

And like most of the other bar/restaurants around Old Town, it can get busy... but that's why you go to a lot of those places... or maybe I am the only one who likes a crowd?  At least it's a pretty attractive crowd.    Also enjoyed the Hangover Fries quite a bit... although I swear I wasn't hungover.  That much.  And I assume before naming these Hangover Fries, they also considered calling them Blocked Arteries Leading to a Massive Heart Attack Fries... but that name was probably too long to fit on the menu.  Anyway, you should probably share these with someone.   We sat outside and the sun was getting pretty hot, so the server (or bartender?) lowered the sunscreen for us.  Can't beat that for quality service!",

There were about 5 tables empty that had not been bused yet, it took the hostess a good 15 minutes to get a table cleaned and get us seated. After that we waited another 15 minutes before our server even came over and asked us for our drink order. It was a little frustrating because the place was a little, busy but not packed. Every time we turned around our waiter was missing, yet everyone else's waiters were taking care of their tables. Finally got drinks, server forgot sweetener for the tea 3 times, 4th time, just stopped asking and drank the tea, food took a while to get out, nothing really special. We ordered 2 burgers and fries. Ordered my burger medium, was pretty well done, my boyfriend ordered his medium rare and was pretty well done. No real taste to the burger itself, the toppings helped some, but not really a great burger for the price! I think by the time the food came, we were irritated just ate and wanted to get out of there. Unfortunately not a memorable place and will not be returning. With this place being around for a while and in Old Town Scottsdale I was expecting a little more. No wonder Rehab burger around the corner had a line out their door (we should have stayed waiting in line over there)",

Maybe we were lucky, but it was delicious.   I came on a Sunday and it was pretty much like a Vegas pool party atmosphere with all you can drink mimosas.  It was a little overwhelming at first but it would be a really fun place to chill on a Sunday when you feel like having a good time.  I can't wait to come back when I'm in the mood to party.",

I have never been to place that charges an entry fee at the door to eat at their establishment during their brunch hours. The bouncer obviously was trying to pocket a few dollars.

It's the usual Scottsdale/ ASU college crowd with bottomless mimosas for $15 with the purchase of an entree. The food is good and plentiful with a large variety for breakfast or lunch. You have the option to sit inside, outside on the patio or upstairs. If you want to be able to talk to the people you came with- sit outside!

Well look no further because I have the solution for your problem.  RnR has now claimed a special spot in my heart as the go to place for my hangover breakfast cravings.  Went here Saturday morning (11:00-ish) and it was pretty crowded with a lot of the people you probably saw the night before.  There was a DJ playing great music to put you in a good mood and you see Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on almost every table.  They have a bottomless option for those drinks so for $15 you can get as many as you want, they just keep coming around and filling them up again.  Dangerous but delicious!  The food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I was trying to be kind of good so I ordered the protein pancakes and you never really know how that's going to turn out but let me tell you, these were some of the best pancakes of any kind I've ever had!  They have blueberries in them, granola on top and come with a good amount of apple butter to spread.  They bring syrup along with them but honestly you don't even need it because they're so good.  My friend ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger which was delicious as well.  The flavors blended really well together, it was cooked perfectly and you could tell the meat was high quality.  All this being said, I think it's pretty clear that you'll know where to find me in the early-ish hours of the weekend.",

    "text": "I found this place while staying in Old Town for a business trip a few weeks back, I was actually looking for a different restaurant a couple blocks over, but the environment seemed inviting enough to stop in and check out. They had a DJ on the patio playing some pretty decent music and the atmosphere was up beat and casual.  The menu looked to have quite a few options and I decided to go with the Jalapeno Mac 'N Cheese to start, followed by the RnR Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Tots. All of which were pretty solid choices. My second time through I started off with the Pretzel Bites and finished with the Bacon Brussel Burger and a side of Sweet Potato Fries.. I haven't come across anything I don't like, and plan on trying something new every time I visit.  What really kept me coming back was the service. From the hostesses, to the food (chefs), to my server Bianca, I've had a pretty great time all around. Definitely plan on coming back soon.",

My friend and I moved to a table and ordered the pretzel app which was delicious as well! Our server was Sam and she was awesome! She had good recommendations and gave great service!

Going to a bar at 11pm you can expect crappy service, but at 5pm on a Saturday when most tables are empty and the bar is only half full..no excuse. It all started as soon as we sat down and it took 15min for the bartender to even take our order. She was rude and walks away while you're still talking to her. We watched this happen with multiple people. They were just as confused as we were. Everyone has a bad day and I'm usually very forgiving if there is a simple mistake. But she was just outright rude and acted like she didn't care about any of the customers. Our food finally comes out and everything looks fantastic but it took another 7-10 min to get anyone's attention for some silverware and napkins. At this point, the food is getting cold. Once we were able to eat, food was fantastic! But unfortunately we probably won't be back since our experience was so bad.",

Since it was like 110 outside, tried to get a drink at the bar but they have seats at the bar and it was packed so trying to squeeze by someone is weird and not cool. So we walked out and went somewhere else where they served us drinks and burgers on the quickness. Smh RnR...",

We have come here for game days and drinks which are pretty lively, but extremely loud. It is a good bar, but the food is sub par.   We most recently came on a Wednesday night. Made it in time for happy hour which entails 1/2 off all wine, beers, wells (i believe) and a select few small bites.  We ordered the animal fries and ate what seemed like day old fries smothered...and i mean smothered w BBQ sauce. The fries were rock hard. Not very enjoyable but we were starving. The salad we ordered was covered in way too much dressing and the grilled cheese wasn't even melted. I don't think ill be coming back, unless it is solely for drinks at happy hour.",

I had an average burger at dinner and today brunch was an overcooked omelet and mimosas. The drinks were good but we had to ask a random server for utensils after our food was served. It took a long time so the food was cold by the time we started eating.   Also, you ran out of ice at 10:00 AM? What...? Why...?  I would never choose RnR.

That aside, we had an appalling experience in the bar area watching Thursday nite football 10 days ago. Two girls came in with a 10 lbs dog. The owner allowed the dog to sit on a barstool, climb \"on the bar\" and eat food directly from her plate.  The dog looked to pee on the bar stool. This went on for about a hour and was ignored by the bartenders and waitstaff.  In my opinion, this is  taking \"dog friendly\" a bit too far.  It was utterly disgusting.   And by the way, the dog was NOT flagged as a service animal.  Even if, no service animal should be allowed to crawl along the bar.",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   Ok, l just love RnR Gastropub.  But first, what is a \"gastropub\"?  The term \"gastropub\" was first coined in 1991 by two London bar owners (David Eyre and Mike Belben).   British Pubs were historically places to hangout and just have drinks, with little to no emphasis on food. It wasn't until more recently that they started to serve food at all, and now have progressively added menus with a larger selection of food.   In 2012, the term \"gastropub\" was officially added to to the dictionary.   RnR: THE HISTORY   So, back to RnR...  RnR opened in 2010 by Evening Entertainment Group. Their 8 venues (Bevvy Gastropub, Bottled Blonde, Hi Fi Kitchen, The Mint Ultra Lounge, Livewire Entertainment Venue, Maya, RnR Gastropub and Sandbar Mexican Grill), are all known for their distinct architecture, dramatic lighting and a great menu.  THE STORY   I first found RnR last year when a few of us tried to have a late dinner and drinks in Old Town and most everything was closed. Someone suggested we try RnR and I instantly loved it.  RnR has everything I like in a bar:  Decor  RnR is a two story, indoor/outdoor, modern industrial architecture with crazy hype lighting and multiple spaces to hangout in, depending on what you're looking for.   There is the dramatic central bar, high tables all around, patio seating and an upstairs that overlooks Scottsdale Road, that has a private bar, that is perfect for private parties.  Drinks  RnR has a full bar, so you can get any cocktail, as well as choose one of their specialty cocktails.  There is an 1,800 bottle wine cellar, serving by the glass or bottle.  Brunch often features the bottomless mimosa.  And there are even delicious imported coffees.  Menu  RnR serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Their motto is: \"Modern American classics with a modern twist.\"  They serve all the breakfast standards, appetizers, salads, burgers, tacos, sandwiches and desserts.  My favorite are the pulled pork sliders.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   There are always a couple bartenders and servers throughout the dinning room, so there is rarely a wait to get served.  AMBIANCE   The atmosphere is super laid back, so coming in alone, with a couple friends, or dressed up on date are all acceptable.   CONCLUSION   5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *There is often live music on the patio which has always been super fun.   *Hours  Mon - Fri: 11am - 12am Sat/Sun: 11am - 2am  *They are available for private or corporate parties, and custom catering.  *My only issue is with the parking, which can be pretty hectic, but that's an Old Town Scottsdale issue, not a RnR issue.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rnrscottsdale.com&s=8f56c1278fc776ac8ead363c2376a2c2ffcd269d2e9d419d045038e95fe2950e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rnrscottsdale.com</a>",

I really appreciated the accommodation and helpfulness!  I didn't know anything about the bar before we got there, and I was pleasantly surprised by the very upbeat, open-air atmosphere. It was a Sunday morning and it was pretty packed, with most people there watching football on the big screen tvs.   Everything on the menu sounded delicious, and I had a tough time deciding! I went with the pulled pork scramble, which was a little dry, but still delicious. My friend had some killer french toast too! And the tacos looked amazing. The best part was the $20 bottomless mimosas and Bloody Marys. Our waitress was AWESOME and I don't think I ever saw the level of my glass go down, because she was constantly refilling it. For bottomless drinks, they tasted really really delicious!   Over all, this was one of the most fun, delicious, memorable birthday experiences I've had in a while! Big thank you to everyone at R&R for making it great!",

Led us to RnR.  It was a Sunday and the noise was loud on the lower level as the games were on.  The host asked us - after seeing the look on my face - if we wanted to go upstairs where it wasn't as loud.  YES!  Upstairs on the outside balcony overlooking the street in November? YES! It was still loud but I didn't care I was enjoying the warmth.  I had the slider sampler and hubs had a blue cheese burger;  Beef good - beef friend! It was all very tasty.  Hubs also had the dirty chips.  The chips weren't bad, just a bit too sloppy for me, he ate them up.   Then the live DJ started spinning some tunes I hadn't heard in awhile and all I could do was stand up and start head nodding and singing along.   I noticed they had some good looking breakfast items and that day the drink special appeared to be a really big pitcher of mimosas.  Good times!  When we return to Scottsdale we will hit them up again.",

Everything here is TRENDY and we liked the lollipop chicken, bacon/Ruben melts, and artichoke dip.   The drinks were great and I liked my margaritas a lot. The bartender was friendly and made drinks quickly. I think this woukld be a great area t consider renting out for a rehearsal dinner or work event.",

By douchebagery I mean Ed Hardy wearing loud mouthed wannabe flashy type people who think they are too cool for school. -Service is pretty bad, mainly this blonde dude who I swear to god must have drank paint thinner as a child. I did have 1 out of 3 experiences there with reasonable service but the other 2 were pretty horrific as the servers just sort of hang out at the bar and don't come check in very often.

The staff is clearly less than happy to be there and could care less about serving you or checking up on you at all.  Very disappointing because the place has great potential.  Took 22 minutes to get my coffee and 45 minutes to get our order for 3 people. 45 minutes for pancakes? Come on! Minus one star.  Most of the dishes lacked sides. I ordered a side of bacon for $4, it was burnt and cold. Minus one star.   Food was mediocre, not bad, not exceptional. But the pancakes did get a sudden lardy flavor after they cooled a little, two of us noticed this. Minus one star.  One star for great atmosphere and ambience.  One star for the manager attempting to win back our patronage.  However, no one in my party will be back to this place. In fact, we rushed to request our check, pay cash and just get out of there.   Perhaps the bar atmosphere is different at night - when no one expects service.",

I think the focus is more on drinks than food (either get there early to eat or eat before you get there). The TVs are ample and the patio is pretty sick. Want to avoid some of the crowds, head upstairs to the second patio or look down into the crowd from the \"overlook\".   We headed outside to the makeshift bar since it wasn't crowded and it had corn hole ripe for the playing. The bartenders were friendly enough. We had a couple of drinks and headed out.

It was nice that we were able to grab drinks by the bar while we waited for our table (and not have it cut into our time).   It's loud, crowded, and can get a little crazy.   It's also Old Town Scottsdale with an AYCD special.   You have been warned.",

Well, the food is, or at least all the food I've tried in my 2 visits with friends. My problem is that both times I've gone on weekdays during lunch...so NOT happy hour, NOT dinner.  At lunch, you have 2 choices: - You can sit inside where you can freeze to death (in the summer).  I was wearing long sleeve and jeans, and still dying; or,  - You can sit outside, where at 11:30 am they blast music so loudly that you can't even have a conversation with the rest of your table.  We just sat and looked at each other and laughed hysterically cause there was nothing else to do.  After several complaints to the server, who kept telling us he couldn't lower the volume, we asked another server and, voila!  it worked.  But I hear this is a daily occurrence.    I love loud music...in my car, in the shower, at a club, at a bar.  Not at my 11:30 lunch.  Maybe I'm just getting too old.",

But because of the open atmosphere, it is great for groups and people watching.   I actually love the breakfast here. It isn't as popular as some of the other spots on Scottsdale strip--so you can get seated and served rather quick.  Also, it is a quick jaunt from the local farmers market, so you can stroll around afterwards.    The food is really good, fresh and well presented. I order hot tea for breakfast frequently-- and usually I just get an old Lipton bag with Luke warm water.  This place gave me a nice tray with quality tea, lemon slices and piping hot water in nice mug. Their side of fruit is also very nice -- you get a cup of fresh berries instead of the standard old honeydew chunks.  Dinner is equally nice.  You have the standard sports bar options (burgers, fries, etc.), but presentation and quality is stepped up a notch.",

Despite advertising that they were open and doing regular business, when we got there and got seated, the waiter told us that it was a limited menu.  No big deal, I get it, but lame.  So we order a couple drinks, some mini hot dogs, and a burger to share.  The drinks were a DISASTER.  I don't think I've ever had a worse drink.  $13 for a tiny glass of vodka and muddled fruit.  No flavor, no sugar, no nothing.  Just straight vodka and fruit.  This is the most expensive drink I've ever seen on a menu and it is worthless.  I can get a damn flaming volcano of rum that has enough booze to knock two of me out for $15 at Hulas...so explain your pricing scheme to me - please.  The mini hot dog things were good.  Nothing special about them, but they were okay.  The burger was giant and pretty good.  It had some massive pieces of bacon on it and was cooked really well.  I am still willing to go back for breakfast one of these days but for the $40 a dropped there, I really didn't get much out of it.  The service was painfully slow and the menu was overpriced.  Welcome to Scottsdale, I guess.",

That may seem like an odd statement but it's not rare to wander into a restaurant and feel that there is a certain element missing. RnR is not one of those places.

Since we had to drive about 25 miles we decided not to drink but realized that only a few drinks could make you forget the loud music that was pumping nonstop throughout the restaurant.  The menu had some unique choices and we opted for animal fries, which was about 1/2 pound of pulled pork over French and Sweet potato fries - enough for more than two as an appetizer. We also ordered the mac and cheese and ahi tuna tacos which were good enough to order again. I would not call this a healthy lunch. It was a real heart stopper - literally.  They also have some specials and I noticed people drinking bellinis all over the place and realized that that it was an all you can drink special.  The crowd is young and hip (I am not but who cares) and I loved the ambiance and industrial look. Great for a bunch of people going out together for some fun but I wouldn't take a first date there because you'll be screaming at each other over the music.  Prices are reasonable for a hip joint on Scottsdale and the place was hopping on a Saturday afternoon.",

Don't give me this BS that only well drinks, domestic beer and two kind of wine are $1 off, what is that?   Well you wont find any BS like that at RnR. What drinks are on special you ask.... Basically everything! INCLUDING but not limited to ANY bottle of wine they offer, reserve wine as well. Premium drinks and their specialty cocktails are not included in the half off drink specials, but who cares if you can get a bottle of wine for $18? Done and done! The Gruet Chardonnay is great!   As for the food.... it a little different. First only a few small plates are offered for $5. We got the Dirty Chips (thin house made ships, way good, drenched in sour cream, hot sauce, bacon and tomatoes) and the Baked Brie (neither of which are on special). Both were alright. The chips got soggy in 5 minutes and the brie was a tiny sliver of brie for like $12. I later got the Ahi Tacos..... eh not much to say. The Ahi itself was good, but buyer beware... it doesn't come in a tortilla, its a jicama \"tortilla\"... a bit strange. I will try the sliders next time we are in.   I have to give a special thanks to Sal, he was very nice, helped us find a spot on the patio to migrate to from inside once the sun went down, and gave us the low down on the specials, best nights to come in, whats going on with football season and the facebook hook ups we should take advantage of. We will be back to say whats up to Sal and get some half price wine for sure.  Also, their breakfast menu looks awesome! Update on that to come for sure!",

Great food, dj, drinks and tvs so we could watch football.",

There's a great deal on bottomless mimosas, and our server, Cassie (who was phenomenal) kept our glasses filled. They give you a wristband for the mimosas, so you can float around the restaurant, and can get a new drink wherever you are. The dj was great, and I appreciated that he took requests and played them quickly. I would definitely come back here for brunch when I'm up in Scottsdale.",

I like the service. The generous apps are easily sharable and very tasty--I recommend fries and nachos alike. I can see why so many folks brunch here!",

Food was great, we had the avocado blt, biscuits and gravy, french toast, and cauliflour bites. all were great! Only reason I give 4 stars is for the bottomless mimosa. The champagne was really flat, and not best quality. Im sure its because they have to mass produce at a quick rate ( there were a TON of people) , but as an avid mimosa drinker I prefer mine nice and bubbly. Especially if Im paying 30.00 for BM. price also seemed a little steep for AZ. If you're drinking to get drunk go for it, but if you want a True mimosa skip it and just grab one of their other drink offerings. overall great place..check it out if you like a day party vibe for your brunch!",

Unfortunately on July 2, we were there to watch the women's soccer game between USA and England. It was an early game and so the place was virtually empty. The waitress was very nice, however the girl behind the bar was definitely having a BAD day.  When I ordered our drinks at the bar she was rude to my wife and myself. Don't know her name but she had long dark hair and appeared to be the bartender that morning. If I was the owner of the R&R I would find a different bartender as it is apparent she will only drive your clientele away, especially the locals as they keep you in business when the part time residents leave.  So if you want to be abused enjoy :)",

We, a group of 8 girls, came here for a Sunday Funday 12:30 reservation, to celebrate something. The waitresses treat you like you're beneath them. They ignore you until it's time for the check. When the check is there, they come back to the table every couple minutes. Besides that, you have to literally yell and flag them down. The champagne glasses are dirty and the waitresses don't care. The food is cold and bland. The girls make you feel like you're not supposed to be here...like your bothering them ! The tip is included, no wonder they don't pay attention to you...they don't have to I guess. We didn't have silverware when our food finally came and the waitress put a big pile of napkins, forks , and knives all the way at the end of the table. I've never experienced that before. So rude.  The music is good. We had 2 mimosas and we ordered \"bottomless\" for $19.20 ..... where are my other mimosas?! Ew the service was horrible horrible horrible. We were seated upstairs Sunday for a brunch reservation we placed with the manager. Your girls are horrible.",

I do recommend the frose though - it was delicious but it does come in a small glass for $8 per glass. They do have a lot of drinks specials each day so maybe that's the way you should do it.

I had the breakfast sandwich pretty standard sausage egg and cheese on your choice of breads including a waffle I kept it safe (an English muffin) It was very average. An hour later we ordered the \"dirty chips\" for the table, homemade potato chips, bleu cheese bacon ranch and buffalo sauce. It had a lot of taste flavors going on and it was good.  Then \"animal fries\" sweet potato and Parmesan fries topped generously with pulled pork/white cheddar and BBQ sauce.

They have a delicious drink menu!!  And their food is so flavorful. I'd like to say there is one thing specifically that I love but I always mix things up. The staff is fun and they love to interact with their tables which makes your experience even better. The management has stopped by our table every time. It's a great place to meet friends or even go on a date!!!",

I heard about the \"unreasonable dress-code\" of this area (to put it lightly) but the fact that they let me right in without a problem is my argument: I had on the same exact pair of shoes on!   The bouncer had the nerve to tell us every bar on that street was going to have the same rules. We walked across the street to another restaurant and had zero problems.   My boyfriend and his friend had the idea to switch shoes and try to enter here after an hour or so following our first encounter and he was let in without any problems. After a few choice words were exchanged, the bouncer must have felt pretty stupid for getting caught and said, \"Your friend can come back and get in, my boss just told me I can lighten up on the dress code.\"   By the way, what is your argument with high top converse? Last time I checked, that is the original basketball shoe.",

He even walked by us multiple times and seemed to completely ignore us.   I give this two stars for the expediter who seemed to be doing more work than the actual server. The expediter was very friendly, introduced himself to us as Carlos. He brought us water, answered our questions, etc. The serving staff seems to be far too self involved to actually care about their staff.",

We sat down at a dirty bar top (mind you there was NO ONE sitting at the bar) because no one came to greet us we got up and grabbed a rag and wiped down our sticky area ourselves, then when the bar top was wet we asked for napkins to dry it off when it was clearly soaking wet. She messed up my boyfriends dinner, but we didn't say anything. She didn't give us silverware or napkins so I had to walk to another table and take them off the table because she never came to ask us if we needed anything so we just waited to eat our food because we didn't have utensils. I ordered a cocktail and she handed it to me without a straw or fruit (it was a vodka/soda) my boyfriends drink sat empty for at least 5 minutes & she cleared my food without even asking if he wanted another drink. Again- service was awful. No wonder the place was empty on a Saturday night. Music, ambience and location are on point, sad miss though.",

If you're newly 21, just want to be a part of the old town party scene, and couldn't care less about the quality of your drinks, then this is the place for you. I was excited about some bottomless mimosas, but turned out to be a total waste of money as I couldn't even get through one glass of the cheapest champagne mixed with nasty ass ocean spray orange juice (maybe that's what's expected with bottomless mimosas?). As far as service goes, our server was okay, however I made my way downstairs looking for the bathroom, couldn't find it, so I found a server and literally in the middle of me asking her where it was she saw someone she knew, completely blew me off, and started chatting with this person as I just stood there watching in disbelief. I was so put off I forgot about the bathroom and returned to my seat. Needless to say my boyfriend and I will not be returning.",

We watched him flirt with a waitress fifteen feet from our table for the next twenty minutes. We actually had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. The bar tender recognized what happened and offered us free drinks, but by that time we just wanted to get the check and get out of the place.   It's a shame because we really do like the food here l, guess business must be so good that they don't care about service yet.",

Of course there are improvements that need to be made and kinks that need to be ironed out... that's to be expected, it's the first week they are open.  The limited menu covered the basics, but it said at the top that the full menu would be  available soon.    The appetizers were actually pretty unique, I had these things called Chicken Lolli-Pops which I have never seen before and they were really good.  I also saw Mussels on the menu, which you don't really find around here.    I had breakfast there this morning and the stuffed French toast lived up to it's hype... worth going back for that alone.  The coffee was really good and the mug it was served in is a must see.  The building and architecture was really amazing, and it is a very warm and inviting spot.  I enjoyed the people watching that the patios provided, and the view of Camelback Mountain is unmatched.  I was there during the Spring Training rush, and they were slammed... and there was some room for service improvement during that time, but the energy was so great that it didn't really bother me.   All in all, the place has a great location, great energy, and great food.  I'm going back!",

    "text": "THe FOOD is GREAT, but the SERVICE is REALLY BAD.  We were even giving it a second chance but the service was still typical snotty Scottsdale service which we don't appreciate seeing as we live here in Old Town. Brittany served us at the outside bar. She seemed to know everyone else around us & was friendly & talkative to them. She gave us our food then went to the other side of the bar, we sat there still needing silverware & napkins. When my husband asked her for a napkin she tossed a few bar napkins toward him. I pointed to the pile of cloth napkins rolled around silverware and asked if we could have those. She put them on the bar without looking up at us or saying anything. We were using a 'daily deal' maybe that's what spawned the bad attitude but doesn't that defeat the point of those to get people in there...or in our case BACK in there for another shot?? We are really good tippers & always tip from the original amount not the 'deal' amount but Brittany got nothing from us. Management needs to know that their servers are hurting their reputation & turning off locals who should be repeat business.  We won't make the same mistake a third time.",

    "text": "Pretty all-around terrible experience at RnR last week, between the food, the drinks, the service, and the cleanliness.  I had heard about the place for a while so I suggested it to my group of 4.  We decided to pay a visit during the early evening.  It's a very nice space with Scottsdale-attractive staff...and that's about where the positive part of this review ends.   Upon arrival we ordered four cocktails from their \"signature\" cocktail list, then watched as muscles the bartender read a cheat sheet on exactly how to make them. While the bartender was clearly struggling with the \"signature\" cocktails, we ordered several shared appetizers--which came out long before the cocktails ever arrived.  The food was cold and some items were not cooked all the way through--maybe a product of them being rushed to our table for some reason.  \"Baked\" brie was cold and unmelted, and the much-hyped animal fries looking like they'd been under a heat lamp for hours (but still cold)...the only decent thing was the shrimp tacos, but it's pretty hard to screw up a fried shrimp taco. Then the cocktails arrived, and perhaps predictably, they all came out looking and tasting awful; just the wrong balance of flavors and not mixed correctly.  The ice had melted because of the time spent trying to mix them.  And two of them kinda tasted like rubbing alcohol. Or gasoline.  Our server had disappeared from the beginning, leaving us with runners who would only say \"I'll get your server\" whenever we had even the simplest of requests--like: \"can we get some side plates?\" \"I'll get your server.\"  Finally, fifteen minutes after the food arrived, the server came by and provided us with side plates for the shared appetizers.  Not that we needed them at that point, but the side plates were still very wet from being washed and several had food residue on them. Disgusting. After the four terrible $13 cocktails, cold appetizers, poor service, and dirty plates, we decided to pack in our planned dinner and head down the street to a place that knew how to mix a drink and cook.  Of course, it took forever to get our check because the server pulled another disappearing act for about 20 minutes, and when the check came, we were shocked at how much all this awfulness cost: almost $90 to be fed cold food and bad drinks while being ignored.  Sorry RnR, but we're never coming back and we've told many people to do the same.",

Anyway, this is a very airy place that has an interesting industrial style 2 story layout. It is sometimes hard to tell if you are indoors or outdoors especially if you are sitting in the patio seats that look out over the street and sidewalk, which creates a very unique atmosphere. I would recommend stopping in for a drink or two.",

    "text": "I live in the area so I was excited when I saw this place being built - it's a cool modern building with patios on both floors. I'd heard complaints from my friends about the service and food but decided to try it anyway. When I walked in I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and the inside is as cool as the outside very open and well thought out.  Service - I decided to grab a seat at the small bar outside (maybe 10 seats) and grab a drink while I was waiting for a friend. For 5-7 minutes I watched the bartender repeatedly walk by she was helping waitresses but never acknowledged me. I would have left but I was waiting for a friend - I grabbed a table on the patio instead. After another 5 minutes of waiting a waiter finally took my drink order. He brought it in a reasonable amount of time but when my friend arrived she had to wait 10min for a drink too. The rest of service for our visit was acceptable.  Food - We tried the artichoke dip which was average but I think the chips were store bought and then heavily salted. I like salt but whoa hold back a little.  Bill - I thought the bill was too high for the service and food.  $5.55+tax for a draft Fat Tire(pint) and $9 for the artichoke dip. Although I would have no problem with that if the service was good and the food was above average. Not yet  I hope they can turn the place around. They did a great job with the design but need to work out the flaws in service and improve the food or lower the prices. It'll be a few months before I try it again - hopefully it will be under new management or have their issues worked out by then.",

She had a real conversation with me and brought me plenty of free beverages to make up for it. However, the manager didn't see how hard she was working (bussing too many tables to handle and too many people to handle) and completely disregarded her efforts.. Our ticket was also off by SEVERAL dollers, Kim, the manager came to handle it and instead of comping out meal she gave out free coupons for a drink nexr visit....which there wont me.

(Sorry forgot her name but she was a blonde who told us she just moved from upstate AZ) she was awesome! Had the best Bloody Mary EVER. The bacon was so crispy and just one of these gave me a good buzz. I ordered this pulled pork with potatoes and this egg on top. It was delicious and so moist full of flavor. We also tried the Brussels sprouts (omg more bacon! Delicious), and couldn't leave without trying the hangover fries ... Wow!! You get a bang for your buck here!!

On the smaller side, but has some booths/tables and a large bar downstairs, and a nice little upstairs area with a small bar.   They were busy, because football was on, and there was a wait for tables when we arrived. We put our name down and headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited.  They offer a nice all you can drink special for $15. It includes bloody mary's and mimosas. If you like either of these options this is a great deal.   About 45 min in we were seated and offered menus. Service was a bit slow, but our waiter was very nice.  For lunch we actually claimed a yelp special which was four flights of beer and some of there dirty chips, which was basically chips with hot sauce, blue cheese, bacon, and I believe ranch. They were awesome to say the least haha. Aside from this we also got a couple of hamburgers and the chicken lollipops. Everything was good, however one of my friends orders came out incorrect. We sent it back, and ended up waiting so long for it to come back out we tried to cancel it. They ended up putting it in a to go box for us to take.  Overall not a bad little spot. I would probably give it another shot in the future, maybe on a slower day.",

When we arrived there wasn't 1 person sitting at the bar, which I immediately noticed since I usually prefer sitting at the bar anyways.  I soon found out why- the bartenders were extremely unattentive- almost to the point where it looked like one of the ladies was actively trying to avoid customer eye contact.  The first time we went up there she was busy looking down drying wine glasses and not surveying the bar at all.  I had to walk around and repeatedly say 'excuse me' before I could get her attention and even then- no smile, no offer of water, nothing- just \"what do you need\"? Followed by bringing the drinks.  Later, when we went to close our tab, one of the bartenders was in the corner by the well chatting with the barbacks (clearly joking around and tossing the towel back and forth, not about work) and the lady from before had her back to the bar and was busy texting on her phone.  By this time the bar had filled up so we waited to see how long it would take for one of them to turn around and check the bar or for a manager to walk by and see what was going on, but after 5 minutes we decided to cut our losses and once again yell to get her attention.  Overall it''s a nice place with a great patio and nicely priced happy hour drinks; their customer service at the bar was just severely lacking and ultimately that falls on the management who should be training better and walking by to check on how they are doing.",

There was about an hour wait, so we sat at the bar while waiting for a table.  The downstairs outside bartender was pretty good, let us do the bottomless bloodies/mimosas even though we hadn't ordered any food yet.  He was making them pretty well, and seemed like a friendly dude.  It has a lot of tvs, so it's a good place to watch a game.  Once we went upstairs for our table and ordered, the food was pretty solid (I got the protein pancakes, which were very solid-yummy), but they were pouring the bloodies and mimosas from a big pitcher at the bar, which is never a good sign.  Overall, good time, but it was super crowded.  The other people who declare that this place has great bloodies have probably never had a really good bloody mary.  They were solid, not spectacular, and pretty weak on alcohol.",

We were told it would be an hour and a half wait. my party of 6 was fine with the wait. 2 and half hours later we still have not been seated. we ask about a vacant table. the only thing is the table behind it has taken all the chairs. they told us there was nothing they can do about them taking the chairs and we were more than welcome to stand at the table and eat. I saw some chairs not being used so I started grabbing them when a blonde employee decided she was going to put her hands on my shoulder and slightly shove stating I can't take the chairs. I'm not even mad that she didn't want me to take the chairs I'm mad she touched me. Unless you're gonna get so drunk you could care less about customer service I don't recommend this place. ps. the food was okay. the appetizers were better than the Buffalo sandwich I ordered. We wanted breakfast , but because we waited almost 3 hours we placed our order 5 mins too late.",

Unfortunately, the food was not so good.  I had the pork hash with eggs & tortillas.  The hash was fine - nothing memorable or special.  The salsa was terrible - seemed straight from a jar, and a cheap jar at that.  Service was okay - nothing poor about it, but not helpful or particularly attentive.  I'll only be back if I'm in the mood for multiple bloodys & mimosas.    Overall, you're much better off at Daily Dose just down the street if you want a fun scene & much better food.  If you're willing to spend more, hit The Mission just a stones throw away, which is outstanding!",

The patios are fun to sit on and have some mimosas and I've like the egg white turkey scramble which is good but feels like a healthy option as well.",

So with that said if your single, this might be a good place to go with a couple friends for some drinks. there is indoor/outdoor seating and tv's outside as well. there is also a second floor as well with outside seating too.   Food: Dirty nachos were bomb!!! so effin good, highly recommend getting your hands on some of those delicious bastards. also had an order of lollipops(chicken cut and prepared so it sits on top of the bone like a lollipop) they had really creative names for everything, all of their apps looked appetizing to be honest. and a +,everything came out super quick.  Drinks: pricey yes. $13 for a martini. i thought o.k jess this can go either way, can be the best damn martini , or you will get suckered and pay for something that you could get for $3 at Applebees. in the end i was in the middle of these two outcomes. Martinis were pretty good, the Overcast is worth trying, again they have really creative names for everything which i love.   overall good experience, worth giving them a try and see whatcha think!",

    "text": "I go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars for RnR in Scottsdale.  Over the summer, they had a phenominal bottomless mimosa special...$10 for unlimited mimosas from open until 2pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  But now that it's football season, and they aren't quite as new, they've upped the prices.  $15 bottomless mimosa special - here's the catch - with the purchase of an entree.  Now, I will say that they aren't ALWAYS super strict about that catch, and sometimes as long as one person at the table orders, they consider it good enough.    Their food is pretty good, although one of my friends complained that almost every dish came with bacon, which she found gross.  She even ordered a bloody mary that had a slice of crispy bacon stuck in it (ewww) As someone who loves bacon, tho, I don't mind.  The prices for the food are pretty steep in my opinion.  My favorite is their absolutely AMAZING baked mac N cheese dish (with spicy pepperjack cheese and bread crumbs on top) for only $5 (portion is small).  Anyone who has read some of my other reviews knows that a good mac N cheese dish qualifies a whole extra star all on its own.  Another quick tip - if you 'friend' RnR on facebook, you will recieve daily 'code phrases' that will provide excellent discounts for the alloted timefram (usually 1/2 off wine or martinis, or hh specials all night long) if whispered to your server.  Overall, good food, decent service, kinda spendy, but fun.  Oh, and their upstairs patio is awesome.",

    "text": "First off, I'd probably put this at a 3.5 if possible. A lady friend and I went here this morning (Sunday) for brunch after a wild night of cosmic bingo at the casino. We ordered the egg whites with turkey sausage, a maple bacon scone, mimosas (which are never ending from 11-3pm on Sundays for around $7 - i only had two though so maybe they took that into consideration?) and coffee. All of the food was really good, and everything that passed us by looked awesome as well, we wanted to try everything!  So the reasons it got knocked some stars down: 1. Our server was miserable. No smile, no hustle and bustle, nothing other than \"What would you like?\" \"Are you ready to order\" and the rare \"Can i get you anything?\" We had empty water glasses at the edge of our table, no offer to refill it, we had to ask. Didn't ask us if we would like cream or sugar with our coffee - had to ask. Also our eggs came with toast but there was no butter/jam on the side for it- again had to ask. Granted it's the little things but in the service industry those are the things that matter most, and all I'm really looking for. If you're not into it, please get a new job. All the other servers seemed pleasant and attentive though, we just got a dud i think.  2. The music was SO loud. The DJ who was playing was decent & maybe im getting old but i felt like i had to wear ear plugs, and could barely hear my friend who was sitting, at most, 3 feet away. We both felt like we were yelling to have a conversation. And our baby headache hangovers were super not happy with it either. And please take into consideration we're the type of girls who love going to festivals - punk rock ones included.  3. We were sat on the upstairs patio (awesome views btw), where there were heaters,  but we both felt like they were not well placed, and today it was chiiiillly! It would have been nice to have been by a heater.   With all of this, we definitely will be back. Their Happy Hour specials look rad and i definitely want to try more of their food selection.",

A couple of patios with misters overlooking Scottsdale Rd are a nice touch when the weather isn't too hot.  I sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed a couple of Fat Tires.  I tried their popcorn rock shrimp which was pretty good.  At happy hour prices, this was an enjoyable place to relax for an hour or so.",

Typical, trendy Scottsdale bar... just like the typical Snotsdale guys with designer jeans, Affliction shirts, pointy leather shoes and large belt buckles.  This is a place you can go, look cute and have skee-zoids buy you free drinks all night- but that is all. Can't dance crazy, get freaky on the bar top... or even LAUGH.   The people here ARE pretentious and they would JUDGE you if you tried ANY of the above.  We had a few drinks here, got bored, and went somewhere else..",

    "text": "In my opinion, Sunday Funday should always start off with a bottomless mimosa brunch, and RnR is just the spot to do that. For $10, you can get all the mimosas or Bloody Marys your heart desires and your liver can handle from 10am-2pm. Our party of five must have averaged 7 per person. Key word is \"averaged.\" There were two in our group (who shall remain nameless) who probably pounded at least a dozen.  The food was really good! I'm not really sure what the whining is all about from a lot of the other reviewers. I loved my pork hash and maple bacon scone (genius), and my friend's grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, brie and sun dried tomatoes and side of sweet potato tater tots (even more genius) were delish!   Obviously, service was amazing, as our group was never left with an empty champagne glass for long. We had fun being rowdy out on the patio, which is an ideal spot on a nice sunny day.   Happy hour specials (daily 3p-7p and reverse happy hour W-Th 10pm-2am) are awesome. Make sure you follow them on FB as well, as they're always announcing other specials.",

I asked the waitress how many tacos I would get for $10 and she told me three. She also told me they would be hard shelled.  Two, already made, hardly filled soft tacos arrived with a small dish of guacamole and salsa. I find $10 for two small tacos extremely over-priced for lunch, especially since the waitress told me I would get three for that price. Another employee told me it's always two soft tacos and told me the waitress was new. Did he offer to give me another taco? No. For his lack of customer service after dissing the waitress, RnR gets a three star rating from the Costume Diva.",

The beer selection is marginal at best, though the African Amber was quite tasty.  Someone ordered some dish that was nacho-like -- potato chips with bacon, ranch, \"buffalo sauce\", and blue cheese. It was delightful. (You could put those ingredients on a piece of cardboard and it would be good. It's way better on crunchy potato chips though).  What I liked the best was the great service. Brittany kicked ass. She managed to keep my beer full and did separate checks for a crowd of 30ish that was constantly shifting around. All with a cheery smile.  Why do they call it \"Happy Hour\"? Shouldn't it be \"Happy Hours\"?? I mean really, does anyone stay for just one hour?",

Our waitress never introduced herself, she just literally propped her breasts up on our table and said \"what do you want?\". Neither of us were impressed. Not to mention there was a small group of bikers that were eyeing us hard. Since we are an interracial couple, this was a very uncomfortable situation. Not really sure what type of vibe this place is going for. Somewhere between a frat house and a motorcycle club I guess. Our server was completely overwhelmed by her three tables and her cellphone. All of the wait staff was distracted by scrolling thru social media and texting, to notice they forgot to place my boyfriends entree order. You could tell who the manager was bec as soon as she walked by, the staff scrambled to hide their phones. Once we reminded our waitress about the missing entree, it was out fast and tasty! My ahi tacos were fresh and light and are the only reason I'm giving this place any stars at all. It's clear the BOH has it together, but the FOH would rather be on IG and FB than earning tips and loyal customers. And this was during a post lunch afternoon. I can't imagine how much of a shitshow it's like during the weekends! Thankfully this one visit to RnR was enough to realize I can do without this place. Tasty food AND excellent service can be found elsewhere.",

We really wanted to eat and take part in their bottomless mimosas. Upon arrival the greeters estimated 1 hour which we were fine with. If we had been quoted 2 hours or 3 we would have been ok with that too, but we were told 1 hour.   We kept getting skipped over and by the 2 hour mark we were very unhappy. The greeter tried giving us a table for 4 and when we told her that wouldn't work she rolled her eyes at us like we were inconviencing her.  While continuing to wait around tables were leaving but other people who were just lingering around snagged the tables because there wasn't anyone around to see it happen or tell them they had to wait if they wanted a table.  The only person who seemed to care that we had then been waiting almost 3 hours was the server Shannon. She did everything she could to find us a table and eventually let us sit outback on the picinic style tables to eat which we greatly appreciated. If we had known that was an option all along we wouldn't have waited 3 hours. Once we sat down outside a table was ready inside. After that the service was just ok.   I understand it is a popular spot on a Sunday morning but there needs to be a better system to regulate tables.",

Service has always been an issue - their staff seems to care a lot more about socializing and primping themselves than they do about actually waiting on their clientelle. The food is alright, I can't say that there's anything special or memorable about any of their dishes. It's just glammed up bar food - nothing that tastes any better or worse than the 10+ restaurants around Scottsdale that have the exact same concept. The breaking point for me was when I ate a chicken sandwich here one night, and came down with the most awful food poisoning that I've ever experienced. 3 days of excrutiating stomach pain and not being able to keep anything down was the straw that broke the camel's back for me about RnR - I will never return here.",

    "text": "My overall assessment of RnR is of a typical overpriced Old Town party place with the attendant spotty service.  We wanted to plan a brunch for 10-12 people on a Sunday morning, so I called RnR a couple days before. The automated phone menu said to press \"2\" for a reservation, so I did. The girl who answered told me that they didn't take reservations, yet when I said that their recording said they did, she stated that was just for the evening. When I asked if she had any suggestions for a large party for brunch, she said to just \"show up.\" Ok, whatever. We showed up before they got too packed, and got a seat up on the upper balcony, which was actually very pretty. Not very mellow though, because a DJ was spinning tracks right below us, and the speakers were on full blast throughout the restaurant (which is fine, I think I'm just getting old and crotchety in my mid-20s).   The $15 bottomless mimosa/bloody mary with an entree is an ok deal, although whatever you do, do NOT order a single mimosa--it cost $8.50 for a measly little champagne flute of mimosa, which is ridiculous. The bottomless mimosa is a good deal only if your server and the busboys are on top of things, which ours weren't. We had to keep hounding them for refills, which makes trying to enjoy the bottomless deal really annoying. A place like Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers has a better mimosa deal, IMO--$10 for the first and $1 for each thereafter, and they're served in a big glass mug.   The food wasn't anything special (my grilled cheese was ok, and the pulled pork breakfast hash was rather dry), but the one standout was the fact that they serve brussels sprouts as a side--I had the bacon brussels sprouts, which were delicious--the one thing that would be 5 stars.   Our server was awful. My order came out the first time as a \"grilled chicken sandwich.\" He got me my original order rather quickly (after assuring me that my ticket would be moved to the front of the line--I kind of assumed it would be, but that's nice to know, I guess), and his apology included the comment that \"it happens all the time.\" As loud as it was, I can understand that occasional issues may happen like that (\"grilled ch---\" could go either way), but one would think that they would have figured out a solution, rather than that continuing to happen \"all the time.\" He also visited three of his tables (right next to us) on several occasions three to four times while studiously avoiding eye contact with us before coming to our table even once. Each time he finally came to our table, he would apologize because \"all his other tables are crazy,\" which just makes it seem like he can't do his job (and isn't incumbent on us to accommodate as similarly paying customers).   In short, RnR is definitely the place to be on a Sunday morning for those who want to keep the Saturday night party going. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, except to not expect this as the place to go for a conversation-laden brunch. If you are wanting to keep the party going, and don't care about how much it's going to cost to get drunk/the quality of the food once you get drunk, then it's totally worth it. Otherwise, you can find me in a laid-back bar with a good beer selection, muttering about \"kids these days.\"",

We were put on the waiting list and gave our cell phone number so we went to the bar for drinks.  The bar was really crowded and loud because of spring training so even with my phone on the highest volume I didn't hear my phone ring (Who thinks it's a good idea to call people to let them know their table is ready in a crowded restaurant?).  I noticed they called me, closed out our tab and was at the hostess stand within TWO minutes of the call.  The hostess notified us that they gave our table away because we didn't pick up the call. I was upset that within TWO minutes of calling us they had the time to call someone else and seat them, while we were closing our tab out.  Instead of apologizing and assuring us we would be seated next, the hostess gave a lot of attitude and blamed US.  When I explained why I was upset she was frazzled and rude.  Then when we finally got sat it was at a table over by the back bar that was way too crowded and extremely uncomfortable, it was as if other guests were eating with us.  The only good thing I have to say is our waitress was wonderful.  She was funny, engaging and we made sure to tip over 20% to show our appreciation.  However because of how rude the hostess was, I won't ever go back personally or to take family or clients.  Just terrible customer service and not once was there any notion of apology or understanding.",

The grilled cheese had 2 very mild cheeses in it so again pretty mild.

Because after waiting 10 minutes for someone to come over, and getting off my ass to ask for water after no one came over, finally get water, order and ten minutes go by without the waitress coming by to offer drinks we were fed up.  The waitresses here have no sense of urgency and clearly the manager did not care about the guest's experience.  The manager stood there with his arms folded blank stare with no reply but those two words. Sorry RnR but two thumbs down, shame on you for putting someone so careless in charge.  Plain and simple you guys are losing money because your servers are not NEARLY as efficient or politely as they should be, and because management enables this behavior , or at least did tonight.   I will say this \"manager\" did have a towel hanging out of his pocket maybe he was the bartender/ MOD.",

If you want a low key brunch- this is not the spot for you.  We absolutely loved it- but we were there with 6 girls who wanted more atmosphere than good food for a bachelorette party.  Music is very very loud- so not the spot to sit and chat.  AND it was a Sunday.  Bottomless mimosas are unbelievable.   My food was great- but one girl didn't like her salad Only suggestion for this bar would be to get some slightly friendlier staff- that would have made the experience awesome.. but our waiter sucked.",

I'm young and I appreciate a fun noisy restaurant but this was way louder than it should be... The food was just okay...we had animal fries for an appetizer which were good, I had tacos which were NOT worth full price (I got them for $5 because of happy hour but would have never paid full price, they were tiny and weird lol) and my boyfriend had a sonoran hot dog which he said was just okay.

The DJ played great music if you love 90's throwbacks, its definitely targeted toward the Millennial crowd for Funday Sunday. Our server was super on top of the bottomless mimosa situation, I don't think my glass was ever empty which is probably the first time that has ever happened to me at any restaurant. On top of all that, the food was amazing. I ordered the Chambord French toast which was cooked to perfection. The creme that it came with had plenty of flavor so no need for syrup.

I had the breakfast tacos (one egg and potato, one egg and bacon and one egg and chorizo) They were not bad, but would have been better with corn tortillas or smaller flour ones because there was a LOT of tortilla for the taco! The only other thing that was irritating was the very LOUD music played by a DJ. Impossible to talk without yelling.  Service was great and we enjoyed the morning.

We waited quite a long time for our check then to have the check processed and then even longer for a to-go box.  It's ok for me and my hubby but I don't take any out-of-town visitors there.  There are too many other options in that area that appreciate their guests and always are looking for ways to Wow them... in a good way.  These guys \"Wow\" me every time... but in a bad way.

Most of the people we're eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us. Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.   My biggest complaint is that we we're ignored unless we we're actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure.",

I have been here a couple times and I think it is a but overprices but it has pretty good food and its a good location.  The service has never been anything to talk about... you usually wait a while before you see a server, wait longer for a drink, longer for your food, and forever for the bill.  The last time I was there was out of control though. I have literally NEVER been so disrespected at a restaurant in my life. We had a question about a charge on the bill and a server said he would find out an answer because he was not sure.  The next thing I know there is a manager at our table with an attitude like I have never seen. He proceeded to tell my boyfriend it was his fault for the misunderstanding, yell across the table at my friend when she was whispering to me that he was being rude, and then tell me that I am not a customer but a guest when I told him this was the worst display of customer service I had ever seen.  After I finally got my boyfriend to walk out of the restaurant so I could pay the bill and he could cool off, the manager came back to the table and told me that \"it was holiday season and he has had to deal with stuff like this all week.\" As a manager of a restaurant, I reminded him that that is his job.  So, if you like being disrespected when you go out to eat this is a great place.  I hope that upper management soon realizes how awful of a manager they have and do something about it.  I can only imagine how many \"guests\" have decided not to return because of him.",

Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and \"come back and try us again.\" He made no effort to \"make things right\" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables.",

    "text": "When you first open your doors for business it is imperative that you make a good and consistent first impression.  It is also critical that your staff is ready to open.  from what i saw and the other negative reviews it seems that they have failed horribly.   i went with my girlfriend for lunch today. entered the front door to a few employees that seemed a little confused, expected for first week.  we chose to sit outside on the bottom patio to do some people watching.  its a nice patio.  SIDENOTE. i just dont understand why there are so many patios build 4 feet away form the road.  scottsdale road is busy mid day and it can be a little irritating eating and drinking with exhaust fumes from city busses, loud hogs (choppers or motorcycles) ghetto people playing bad music too loud with their windows down, thinking they are hardcore, but then again its people watching.  ANYWAY  everything was fine until we ordered our food. a salad and ahi tacos. SMALL menu.  NOTHING exciting.  quite the boring menu.  i had higher expectations.  anyway ,after we ordered i asked if i could glance at the dinner menu, our server said \"yea i think i can find one of those.\"  when he returned empty handed 15 mins later to refill my soda, his response was that the dinner menu was still in the works and not yet available,  hopefully wednesday.  ok whatever.  he then says that the kitchen has had some issues and had to cut the tuna to order.  ok whatever i can kind understand that too.  however, i can personally cut and portion about ten pounds of ahi tuna in ten minutes by myself.  hopefully a fully staffed kitchen can handle a not very busy lunch, right?!?   wrong.  more time goes by and when our server returned to say our food was still not quite ready yet i told him we were leaving.  and we walked.  all in all we waited about twenty five minutes for a seared piece of tuna and a salad.  this should take about 5 minutes, 10 if your slammed.  if for whatever reson it takes longer a manager should stop by and show face.  there was nothing.  no concern from management.  i didnt even see one.  the server did seem genuinly apologetic and i left him some cash for the time in his table.  on our way back to the car we saw mission and, starving, we went there and had a great lunch.  sorry RnR but you screwed up.  you are clearly not ready for business and need to do some retraining.  i heard they had hired a quality exec chef and then fired him before opening.  the only thing you are good for now is an overpriced beer and overflow from the blue moose durring spring training.  maybe some ASU hunting grounds.  that seems fitting for what you have.",

That's when the waitress told us between 3 & 7 it was 1/2 price happy hour. Great! Came back the second day after the game at 4:00 for drinks & ordered a round. Waitress said $11. I asked her wasn't it happy hr? She was very apologetic. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Came back the third day after a game at 5:00 & ordered a round. The third different server said $11. Again I asked him wasn't it happy hr? He apologized & charged us happy hr prices. We were not happy. We felt like they were trained to cheat tourists. We were wearing  our Giants garb. We will not go there again.",

So we grabbed a drink at the bar.  The host was a little scatter brained. When I checked our status about 25 minutes later, he said \"oops, I thought I sat you\"  He had crossed my name off the list.   Really? Was there another party of 10 in the restaraunt... No!  We noticed that he went missing for a while a two large both opened up, back to back.  The server was annoyed that they were sitting empty for so long, so she asked if wanted to sit there... at this point it was about 6:40, so we took her up on it.  She was great, I thought it was going to be a repeat of my last experience with terrible service, but she did make up for it.   I guess all I can say about RnR is if you're going there for HH, get there early and plan on waiting.   It's a neat place but if they don't take care of their service issues they will go under. This is scottsdale, there will be another trendy spot, and their legecy will die.",

Try the chicken lollipops(very small), good mac n cheese, pork sliders...tater tots good, fries not so much. Steak sandwich was good but a bit skimpy on the meat.  The few missteps: no one seems to be in charge, disorganized staff, no matter how many times we mentioned the soda was off they kept bringing more without addressing the problem!? Service really needs to be better to make this a go to spot..",

The must have spent a mint on for the location, building and build out but forgot to invest in training their staff.  I asked the waiter to get me a glass of temprarnillo wine and if they didn't have that, then just to bring me an IPA.  20 Minutes later he shows up with an IPA .  I asked for a wine list and right on the list it says they have tempranillo.  You could tell the waiter had no clue what I was asking for.  You would think that their wait staff would at least know their wines since they have pairing suggestions on their menu.  My fiance and I ordered lunch and it took over 1 hr for it to come out!!!  My bread sandwich....excuse me, chicken sandwich came out between 2 huge slices of bread and the smallest chicken breast ever.The potato chips where wet with oil and chewy. .  Everyone in the place had the same type of horrible service. They did not comp the meal after we had to wait over and hour for a sandwich.   I feel bad for this place because you can tell they spent a ton on it but unless their service dramatically improves I can not see this place keeping its doors open for very long.",

It's one of the only places (that I know of) that you can get brunch and drinks during the week, which was exactly what we were looking for. I had the sundried scramble, it wasn't amazing but definitely good. I really liked the portion size, not minimal but not huge and overwhelming as it seems most places are these days. Next time I will definitely try something else as a lot of other menu items sounded really good to me. Our server was super nice and the place wasn't that crowded at all (so no negatives regarding the clientele from me). Husband loved his bloody mary made with the unique pepper infused vodka. I also really loved my cappuccino, so much that I had two. WAY better than Starbucks - and the coffee cups are so darling (I really wanted to steal one)!  We will definitely be going back for breakfast/brunch and to try out Happy Hour as well, the drink/food specials looked awesome!",

Our server was pretty inattentive and seemed uninterested in our table upon our arrival... it was almost too obvious.   After a Sunday of day drinking, my party of 5 decided to go to RnR for a quick hangover remedy--\"Hangover Fries\". I opted for the Animal Fries, which were absolutely delicious & just what I needed. My boyfriend could not get his hands off my plate. So, they each got their orders: sliders, a couple of hangover fries and a Bleu Cheese burger prepared MEDIUM.   We waited about 15 minutes for food in the lull period of the day. No prob.  My friend's burger was definitely prepared Well. No pink at all. And when addressed, our server said, and I quote, \" I don't eat burgers, so I wouldn't know.\"   Now, she said that not meaning to be funny, but we thought it was a hilarious scenario being that she works at a gastropub that SERVES burgers and meat. Super confused to how she even works there if she feels so strongly.   Anyways... food was not bad, overall. I loved my Fries... Consensus for the Hangover Fries... nice. Sliders... dry. But the burger was definitely questionable.   If I go again, I'll hit the bar for a to-go order.",

We've had pretty much all of their apps by now and quite a few of their sandwiches so here are our faves:  Lollipop Chicken App - Really tasty, careful with the spicyness! Animal Fries - Awesome combination of fries and meat make this a don't miss. Dirty Chips - Nice alternative to the fries, bleu cheese crumbles really make this dish. Grilled Chicken Sandwich - Wow, so many great flavors going on with this one.  Pair it with their Sweet Potato Tots for a solid choice.",

The music was pretty loud, so you have to shout to your friends if you want them to hear you.  It was amusing to see that some customers looked like they were still wearing their NYE outfits with their stilettos, shiny dresses, and suits.  I love people watching in Old Town!  Anyways, although our group had a reservation, we still had to wait 30-45 minutes until we were actually seated.  But I definitely didn't mind, because the crowd was fun, and bottomless mimosas are $15.  Apologetic for the wait, the restaurant manager came over to our table on the patio and gave our table free appetizers and tickets to a nearby club.  Score!   I ordered the Egg White Turkey Scramble that included apple turkey sausage, roasted red peppers, spinach and scrambled eggs, home fries, and toast.  Prices are on the mid to high side, but don't forget that this is Scottsdale.  My dish was light, flavorful, and was perfect alongside my mimosa.  For appetizers, our table enjoyed the Jalapeno Mac n'Cheese that consisted of cavatappi pasta tossed in a spicy jalapeno cheese sauce and topped with parmesan bread crumbs---it was scrumptious.  We also enjoyed he Hangover Fries, which were parmesan fries loaded with cheddar cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes and bacon topped with two eggs sunnyside up with sour cream.  Wow---I had never had eggs on top of my fries before, and the name \"Hangover Fries\" is perfect.  Our table scarfed these down, and some people claimed that their hangovers were already subsiding!  I was impressed with the staff, because they were on their A-Game.  They didn't forget anything when we asked, and were just great.  I definitely plan on coming back, because RnR rules!",

Homemade chips with blue cheese, bacon, cheese... Yums... I usually love them.  I like RnR for 2 reasons... Dirty Chips and Sunday Brunch/Day Party.  When I have friends in town, this is the place we skip church to go to for food and bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's from 10-3pm.  If you have these type of friends in town, this is a cool place to go for brunch and bypass the snooty brunch locations in Phoenix/Scottsdale.    RnR has the craziest hours of a restaurant like this... 8am - 2am.  Yes folks... I have gone here after a night out for those Dirty Chips.... Dirty Chips. *singing*  A DJ starts around 10ish.  If you have a large party, make a reservation.  Get there just before 10 to avoid the crowd.  This place calls itself a Gastropub, but I wouldn't.  I think of it as a cool local bar eatery.

You can't really go wrong with the menu, from two eggs anyway, french toast, breakfast taco plate, animal fries to the pulled pork sliders. The ambiance is very upbeat with their friendly servers and dj playing a compilation of different sets.  The only draw back is the wait. Depending on your party's size and what time you come it could be anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours to be seated.

The clientele and the atmosphere were a big disappointment. We went on a Sunday night during Labor Day weekend and the clientele looked like the I-just-turned-21 folks.  It wouldn't be so bad had I not been here before and experienced a more sophisticated crowd.  But then... the bathroom.  It was nasty.  Although the restaurant was not crowded at all (maybe a third full), you would think that it was a Saturday night at a club.  There were drinks on the toilet, toilet paper on the floor, and... well, it was just dirty.  I'm a runner so I am used to port-a-potties, but when I'm at an establishment that served chicken lollipops and bleu cheese sliders, I expect not to see a toilet paper on the floor at different stalls.    There are a bunch of other gastropubs in Old Town and SoDo. I will explore other places before I go back to RnR again.",

I have had salads, burgers, breakfast items, those Brussel sprouts, its all just like mehhh.  anyways, the reason you go here is for sunday fundays, bottomless mimosas, or sporting events bc the TVs and in that regard this place is a lot of fun and awesome  but can i really give more than 3 stars to a restaurant/bar when the service is terrible and the food is bland? especially when its not dive bar prices?  thus, -1 star for food, -1 for service.",

Just get there early, because you ARE going to be waiting for a table, even if you're there when it opens. You're still somehow waiting for a table. So just get drunk on mimosas and pretty soon you'll forget how long you are waiting.  Will definitely be back.",

Bumpin music with quick service is just what you need on sunday fundays, which is what we got at RNR Gastropub.   We celebrated our friend's birthday here so there was a huge group of us and with the nonstop mimosas and Bloody Maries, the group soon became quite a handful I'm sure. Needless to say, their service was excellent and drinks were amazing.   I got a Mango Margarita which was very refreshing. To complement the drink, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos, which took refreshing to another level. They wrap the tuna with radish wraps, which was very light and healthy. Nachos, Fries, and the breakfast burrito was all good.",

    "text": "RnR is one of those places that we seem to go to every time we have a visitor in town and want to brunch. The atmosphere is always guaranteed to be rowdy and loud, which I don't see as a negative at all given what the restaurant is supposed to be- a fun spot to have brunch and get tipsy off mimosas while listening to a live DJ.   The food is pretty decent, but nothing exceptional to write home about. I've had a ton of items on their brunch menu and since I don't expect anything stellar I'm not usually disappointed. One food item I would definitely stay away from though is their bacon brussel sprouts. Theirs are steamed and they're served in a little dish with a ton of water still surrounding them. They really should start pan sauteing them or something because they just simply aren't enjoyable at all.   The main reason I give this place only 3 stars is because I feel like the employees aren't super friendly, and the restaurant has a reputation of some shady practices. Bottomless mimosas for 15 bucks when you buy an entree- great! Bottomless mimosas that are mostly OJ with a very small amount of champagne and sometimes even WATER added- not so great. In my opinion they should either increase the cost of bottomless mimosas to have actual quality drinks, or just scrap the thing. Also, the bouncer is pretty rude. You don't need someone mean mugging every person that walks through the door in order to get IDs checked. Hire people who are friendly, not just willing to show up and get the job done.",

It settles so well!! :)  The service was great!! We had two very lovely ladies help us, on what seemed to be a busy Wednesday afternoon/ Happy Hour. Our server was genuinely suggestive and sweet!  The four stars is just due to the surplus of employees that were just wondering around our tables, (mostly guys) that looked over and walked around looking bored kinda distracting when your having a conversation and enjoying food!

We sat at the bar and I had to ask 3 times for water. The servers never checked on us and always had to be flagged down. We never got asked if we wanted another round of drinks. The 4 servers and host grouped up in the corner hugging on each other and socializing about 1 hour of the 2 hours we were there.   The food was fine. We had the animal fries, pretzel bites and a salad. Nothing spectacular, but it was fine.  We live in south scottsdale, just 1 1/2 miles from old town.

They had a great sense of humor when we were making jokes, or even when they made jokes in the first couples minutes we met.   FOOD ORDERED: PULLED PORK HASH: let me tell you, this meal comes with a lot of food! Definitely worth splitting between two people. The pulled pork was pretty good. Came with eggs and veggies and toast. Certainly something I would recommend getting to eat.  CHORIZO BREAKFAST TACO: almost looks like a del taco taco but most definitely tastes way better. Very simple with cheese chorizo and egg. Wasn't too bad.   SERVICE: Well let's start by saying all the servers are gorgeous AND they're on top of the endless mimosas! Our server was really nice and had a pretty cool personality. As said earlier, hostess and security guards were chill.   Definitely a spot I would recommend. No clue how this place has 3.5 stars!",

The coke and Kilt lifter were also flat, but that TV screen is still huge and will try something else on a future visit.  Everything has been remodeled, some specials have gone by the wayside, but the giant door to enter, remains the signature piece of this restaurant. I partook in the grand re-opening week which included half-price food and drinks. The turkey club was not traditional, but had all the club ingredients on a regular sandwich. It was good quality turkey, poor tomatoes (end pieces), but had good crunchy bacon and the sweet potato fries are good enough. It was worth the $7 this visit, but not sure about full price in the future. The biggest change is that they went from five or six burgers to basically one burger and a bunch of healthy things. Happy Hour looks decent, so that is probably when I will end up there now.",

    "text": "FOOD POISONING!! We took my girlfriend here for her birthday yesterday morning specifically for the bottomless mimosas and the impossible burger and tacos. Our server was good mind you, though we never got her name, so that isnt our problem. Two members of our group, including the birthday girl- you know the whole reason we're out running up a $300 tab- share the \"impossible tacos.\" Both of them fell violently ill, one before we could even leave. Both of these girls are long time vegetarians so either the food was bad and made them sick, or, and what I think is more likely, they put real meat in the tacos and it reacted badly with them. Either way it ruined her birthday and wasted us a lot of money. We won't be going back,  the bottomless mimosa are a good deal, but it's not worth someone being so careless and/or unsanitary with your food. There are much better places around that have higher health standards.",

Getting our server's attention took a large hand gesture's amount of effort, at which point she still didn't really seem to care too much. Drinks were overpriced and not made well. I think the bartender was equally distracted chatting with his coworker and missed the fact that he probably dumped half a bottle of agave syrup in my margarita. Which had to be remade not 1, not 2, but yes 3 times to taste even slightly decent. I wasn't even going to bother with try #3 but it actually turned out ok, and I didn't want to completely waste $11. Our server also refilled my friend's water (only because she asked) and left mine mostly empty... so bad it was actually kind of funny. I hope they enlist some help management help because this place has potential, but I will probably not be back to find out if it has improved.",

RnR was spacious and had misters and fans throughout the patio and balcony, so chilling in the hot Phoenix sun was easy. A dj was spinning some pretty bumping beats and the waitress was generous with the mimosa pours.   Two people at the table ordered the hangover killer and I really wish I had gotten that. Looked and smelled delicious. I got the scramble which wasn't nearly as great.   I was definitely here for the atmosphere and fun though, so I didn't mind the scramble.

    "text": "Located on Scottsdale road just past 1st and featuring a 2-story dining patio plus an industrial chic interior I arrived at RnR just after 8:30 and finding ample parking I made my way in to a sign suggesting I could seat myself - a reasonable proposition that left me any number of 4-6 tops with a great view of the HD-Flatscreens as only one other (very hung-over) party was present - and moments later I was greeted by a young man named Fredrich who would act as my server - and a good one at that considering my substantial capacity for caffeine and nearly two hour stay.  Having already researched the menu online and with $30 to spend per my gift card I spent a few minutes perusing the menu and with the game now tuned in (by request) my order was placed I was left to wait - half studying/half watching the game and fully aware that the restaurant was soon to get quite full and quite loud but perhaps slightly less knowing of just how much food I'd ordered as I sipped a bold and smoky brew simply described as \"Italian Roast\" and fitting that description quite admirably with an ever so slightly 'over-roasted' top note that begged for something sweet - and here, sweetness would come in spades.  Now bearing in mind that Fredrich was the only server I interacted with during the course of my meal I will say here that he could have warned me of what was to come but in all reality I'm kind of glad he didn't because it would have ruined the surprise of the first dish to arrive - a cinnamon roll the size of a hubcap finished off with a gigantic sparkler that simultaneously made me the child in me think awesome while the adult just laughed at the gluttony realizing that there were 4 more dishes to come...and that the whole room was staring at me.  Presentation aside, the cinnamon roll itself was additionally quite excellent; the outside ring suffering from a bit of dryness due to the substantial size but the interior warm, flaky, and easily imbued with a whole stick of butter, a half cup of icing, and multiple tablespoons of cinnamon.  For those wondering, I ate all but the outer ring - and yeah, I could've probably eaten that as well, but the Quails on Main Street looked hungry and I had four more places to eat on the day's agenda.  Moving on to my other options, proving the adage that bigger is not always better the Chambord French Toast would prove to be an excellent dish well worthy of its \"signature\" status with a thick slice of egg bread - think challah without braids or brioche but lighter - split and stuffed with Chambord infused cream cheese and topped with raspberries, Gran Marnier, and light creme Chantilly.  Still a large dish, but far less so than the cinnamon roll the French Toast was a practice in subtleties as each constituent was present, pleasant, and balanced without overwhelming the others...and proving my little sister's theory correct once again, a bit of maple syrup certainly didn't hurt.  For the last item I'd eat during my stay, a single vanilla bean pancake with apple butter would prove to be sole lowlight of the morning as the cake itself was dense rather than fluffy and largely lacking in vanilla flavor, though the apple butter and seasonal berries were quite nice.  Noting here that I would have been more than contented to leave RnR with a favorable impression at this point, with a $30 certificate to spend and the Buckeyes to watch I stuck around sipping coffee for quite some time while picking at the cinnamon roll and once The Ohio State University had assured a win I picked up two items to go - a chocolate chip muffin and maple bacon scone - both baked in house, served warm, and very nicely done with the scone soft and subtle while the muffin was slightly toothsome and studded with dark chocolate...they went great with a cup of coffee later on at Cartel and solidified RnR as a place I'd definitely return for brunch or perhaps dessert to check out the carrot cake (and maybe a second go at the Cinnamon Roll.)",

I like this place because you could bring your mom for lunch or your boyfriend for late night. They have all kinds of appetizers. I would say the flavor is mainly American with a twist. I've had the \"animal fries\" and they are delicious, also the nachos are good and the sliders.. Actually I have to say all the food I have tried has been good.

Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide.   We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.  I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it.

The second time it was only a 25 minute wait which is actually great for Old Town on a Sunday. I really enjoyed my meal! I had heard mixed reviews about their food but I went with 4 other people and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. the real reason we went was because they have bottomless bloody mary's AND mimosas for an extra 15 dollars until 2pm. Definitely worth it if you make it a competition between you and the restaurant to see how many you can finsih to get your money's worth. You do have to purchase a breakfast item to get this 15 dollar bottomless deal but it is probably a good idea to eat when drinking that much anyway. Just be aware you can't switch between mimosas and bloody mary's so make sure to choose wisely. The only complaint that I had was the noise level was soooooo loud! This place is open from 8am to 2am because it turns into a club at night. However, I don't think they adjust their music volume depending on the time of day which can be a little much for the morning and when you are trying to chat with friends.",

    "text": "This place was recommended by some friends as a good place to come for drinks and have a bite for brunch.  I can see how this place will be a good spot for some pre-drinking prior to going out.  But the food left me feeling like I would never go back again to have something to eat.  I went with a group of 5.  We had ordered the chicken lollipops for a starter, which was their interesting take on chicken wings.  They weren't bad the ranch was pretty bland but what happened after was what left a bad taste in our mouths.  We had ordered ahi tacos, caesar salad, both versions of french toast and some hash browns.  We waited about 45 minutes to get our food.  Once we got it the hash browns and french toast were made wrong so they had to make the french toast again.  I know they are new and working out all the kinks but then do something about it since it took so long for us to get our food and messed the order up.  The tacos were ok tasting but very small, the salad was typical nothing anybody couldn't make at home and their versions of french toast were just ok at best.  The hash browns were cold and undercooked.  After an experience like that, I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody looking to eat.",

    "text": "We took a break from work to eat at RnR for lunch and we all left with smiling faces. The look of RnR is unlike any other venue in Scottsdale. It has a very laid back urban industrial feel to it, which I really like. I absolutely love that it has 2 large patios, especially with one being upstairs. It has a fantastic selection of seating and they can definitely host any size party you want. The staff was extremely friendly. Every person we passed greeted us with a smile and our waiter was very attentive to us. We all shared a few items together and the food was awesome. The ahi tacos were so fantastic and full of flavorful. The chicken lollipops were deliciously spicy and fun to eat. Their parmesan fries were seasoned amazingly! Probably the best I've had. Their fruit bowl had the best selection and was perfectly ripe. The RnR burger was full of flavor, like heaven on a bun. The gorgonzola salad was the perfect mix and so refreshing. It had strawberries, apples, honey glazed walnuts, gorgonzola, cheese and prickly pear dressing. I also heard nothing but great things about their breakfast! I'm really excited to go back and enjoy the patio with friends, good food and cocktails. I would highly recommend going there when you're in the area.",

    "text": "My friend and I wanted to go to dinner and she's been talking about this restaurant nonstop. Let's just say it was not what I expected at all.   My friend arrived there before I did. Nobody acknowledged her for about 15 minutes so she ended up seating herself. After I arrived we both actually ordered our drinks and entrees at the same time. She ordered the vegetarian tacos which came with a custom soy sauce. She asked the waiter what were the ingredients which he had no knowledge of and said he would bring it on the side for her. I ordered the chicken tacos and a glass of the Irony Pinor Noir while she ordered a peach ale beer.   First, it took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. We sat by the bar so we noticed that they were just sitting on the counter for a good 10-15 minutes before we even received them. When he finally brought us our drinks, he apologized and said there was a delay because they ran out of my wine that I ordered. My friend told him that's unlikely since we've seen our glasses on the counter, FILLED for the past 20 minutes.   My friend then wanted to get some tortillas on the side. Our waiter did not come back to our table so she literally walked up to the bar to order her tortillas. Not to mention she never received the custom soy sauce on the side that she requested.   All in all, I was very disappointed. When i go to a restaurant there are two things that I look for . Good food and good customer service. It was a very unfortunate experience for me because I really enjoyed my food and my wine tasted remarkable. Such a disappointment for such a nice establishment with good food!",

    "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE! Too bad I can't give zero stars. First time eating at this establishment. We had a reservation for a party of 10. (Emphasis on \"party of 10\"). We showed up, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to seat us at our table...the only problem was that the table only seated 6 ! We explained to the server and hostess that we had a reservation for a party of 10...NOT 6! They looked at us with a confused, puzzled, \"deer in the headlights\" look. I suggested (trying to help them implement some rudimentary, simple creative problem solving) that they provide us a few more chairs from all of the empty chairs in one area of the restaurant. The \"deer in the headlights hostess\" then responded by saying, \"...oh, we can't take any of those chairs, those are for a reservation.\" I then said, \"...WE HAVE A RESERVATION AS WELL...for a party of 10!\" She then responded, \"...yeah, but their reservation is for a party of 21.\"  WTH? I then had to help them formulate the next simple creative problem solving step in this process by suggesting that they get a table and chairs from outside and add those to our area so that we can accommodate 10 people. They responded, yeah...that's a good idea! They then brought over a table which was about as sturdy as a table sitting on a bowling ball. It rocked and wobbled all over the place. We had to work to prevent our drinks from spilling. Did they offer to fix it you may ask? Why, of course not! They simply dropped the wobbly table on the floor and walked away. But wait...there's much more. I then had to tell the server to wipe off the tables, which were covered with a sticky residue of some sort (which I happened to lay my arm on it). I guess they don't care about wiping off tables and chairs before seating guests. Ok...now to more incompetence. We were assigned a new server. She immediately proclaimed that \"tonight is my first night.\" in my opinion, it appeared that it was the first night for all of the employees. One bright spot was that the food tasted good. Fast forward to the end of our \"experience at RNR.\" Our server showed up to collect all of our credit / debit cards. She then disappeared to run the payments. She then returned all of our cards...only to come back again and ask for our cards a second time. Seems that she \"made a mistake\" the first time. She said the payments didn't go through. We all gave her our credit cards again. Later that evening all of us in our party noticed that RNR ran our payments TWICE! One of the couples in our group (who should have only had a bill of $45) was charged over $170!!! Not only did the server charge them twice, she charged them for somebody else's ticket! I called the Manager at RNR on Monday and also today (Tuesday) and explained what happened. He offered NO apology (yesterday or today's phone call) for the terrible service, NO acknowledgment. Seriously?? Not even one apology for the myriad screw-ups? Unbelievable!! All of us in our party have had to file claims with our banks to have them reverse the charges. The superfluous charges STILL have not been reversed, as the banks have said it can take up to 10 biz days! Apparently, RNR Gastropub needs to hold some serious remedial customer service training, and hire some \"semi-intelligent\" people who are capable of some semblance of analytical thinking, and creative problem solving. Needless to say, we will definitely NOT be going back there again. You can get better service at McDonald's.",

Sat ourselves at a table near the bar.  There were about 6 waitresses or hostesses, and NOT ONE SINGLE EMPLOYEE stopped to ask if we have been helped.  As we try to stop one of the waitress passing by to ask if we can place an order, she rudely said to please ask OUR hostess for help.  WHOEVER THAT WOULD BE AND LIKE WE WOUKD KNOW WHO SHE WAS.  For customer service, you would at least think she would say she'll get her for us, but NOPE!  However the same waitress who could not help us or inform our hostess that there's a table needing service, did by the way, serve two guys who sat right across from us 30 mins later.  She served them promptly too, as she did with the table behind us!  As we walked out, a hostess finally spoke to us and said, \"Byeeeee, thank you for stopping by.\"  I told her, you know what.....that's the first time a hostess bothered to speak to us.",

There was also a great mix of people and the male to female ratio was perfect. Something you normally would never see at a bar like this.   I really enjoy the floor plan of this establishment as it opens up to the street providing an airy feeling without losing any energy. The drink prices were very reasonable as well, a trend I noticed throughout Scottsdale. Maybe it is that OC/LA is that damn expensive? Your call.  I also noticed they offer a full menu and will have to return on my next visit to AZ to sample their offerings. As a bar alone you get no complaints from this Yelper.   RnR brings the ruckus!",

It is kind of like a little party in there, music is loud and everyone seemed to be having a good time.   We shared the breakfast burrito off of the brunch menu and then the street corn off of the regular menu.  The mimosas were actually quite nice. Mostly champagne with a bit of orange juice. I don't really like champagne but the taste of the one they use is quite pleasant. Nice way to get a good buzz without spending too much. The burrito was a little dry but still tasted fine. The street corn was SO GOOD. They put it in a bowl rather than on the Cobb which I actually liked. Didn't have to worry about corn in the teeth.   Lastly, the service was good. Our server (pictured in the food pic) did a great job. He was attentive and made sure our drinks stayed full. Overall good experience and next time I visit I will have to swing by again.",

All the gals are interested in is chatting to their friends at the end of the bar or being on their phones the whole time. Ignoring customers totally.  Until they get staff that are actually interested in serving customers I won't be back.  Why don't all restaurants ban personal phones being used during work hours so people actually do what they are getting paid for ?",

Wayy too loud for my liking. You can't even hear the person talking across from you at the table.  We were placed outside on the patio. quite warm that day. No sprinkler system in place or fan. So would avoid as the summer months comes about.   But either way, music is wayy to loud.  As other mention, come here to party with the music, but not for relaxing brunch.   I ordered the RNR burger. Pretty basic in taste, but was cooked right and to your liking. Did feel like it lacked flavor, or lacked something extra. Fries were good. Also on the pricey side for a burger.  would not likely come back here for brunch, unless you're out of town and looking for a dayclub brunch place.    PS. It did take like 45+ mins before the food started to come out.",

They don't really advertise it on the menu clearly but they do offer it, it's the \"keep them coming mimosas and bloodys.\"  You know when its bottomeless and the restaurant waters everything down or its more juice than champagne? Not at this place! I'm pretty sure at one point my boyfriend for a full cup of champagne. The servers just bring a huge pitcher to your table and you are literally never low. Which is so nice and a breath of fresh air to know you're not getting jipped. The bloody mary looked watered down at first glance but it was a pretty tasty bloody mary! Our server Mackenzie was great and the cutest!  We ordered a cobb salad and the rock shrimp tacos. I LOVE THAT THE SIDE FOR TACOS IS STREET CORN!!!! Can that please happen everywhere? The tacos were do delish. I love the crispy shrimp. And the street corn was literally the best touch, I actually can't stop thinking about it lol. The cobb salad was eh. The chicken was a little burnt and the bacon was cooked weird and had a weird taste and I wanted to throw up lol.  All in all, I loved this place and the vibe it gave off. Don't come here if you are trying to just enjoy a nice \"relaxing\" brunch or lunch. It's a full on party. Huge bachelor/bachelorette groups everywhere, shots being taken all the time, loud music. It's a ton of fun I would definitely recommend!",

We ended up have an hour wait for a table for 4. Once we were seated we enjoyed the Dj; he was def playing a versatile selection of music and I like that. Everyone inside was definitely having a good time. We had the unlimited mimosas which I think most patrons were enjoying. I had some sort of taco dish that was so good.   All and all it was a good spot to be. Not a place for kids.",

The bar looks cool from the outside but inside there is nothing worth sticking around for. Scottsdale has far too many excellent bars and restaurants to choose this place.

When we asked for a table inside they said only parties of 6 or more can sit inside, they never explained that when the reservation was made. They had empty tables and people that were coming in with smaller groups were being seated inside. It really felt that they were discriminating against us and we weren't getting the same treatment as other guests. I will never come here again and will let everyone know about this experience.",

The music is loud, the TVs have sports and it feels like a party. I recommend coming here if that is the type of experience you are looking for. If you want a quiet brunch, this is not the place for you.   Drinks: I only had the bloody Marys but they were pretty good! The best part was that they were bottomless. Each one costs $10 and bottomless is $20 so you will definitely get your money's worth if you plan to have three. They also offer the same deal for mimosas.  Service: The bartender was attentive and friendly. The hostess at the front was also nice and welcoming.  Food: The food was average, which is why I am giving four stars instead of five. I love brunch mostly for bottomless drinks, so food isn't a huge factor for me, but it would have been nice if the food was slightly better. I got the breakfast taco trio and I felt like it was just eggs and tortilla rather than eggs and a protein. The potatoes also weren't very good.  Overall, if you are looking for a place to get a buzz on a Sunday morning, this is the place for you!",

    "text": "Awesome place for drinks and brunch if you're looking for a louder and exciting spot to celebrate something or watch a sports game!   RnR in Scottsdale is a restaurant my friend suggested for Saturday brunch when I came to visit. It's located right off the souvenir shops and usually can't be missed from the blasting music that can be heard even a block or two away. Note there is ID check at the door.   We came at 10am to no wait, though it gradually got more crowded (and the def turned up the music). They have the largest tv I have ever seen! It literally covered the entire wall, in addition to a plethora of other tv's all around the gastropub.   I got a breakfast taco plate ($10) here because I couldn't decide what I wanted. I'm glad since it came with potato & egg, chorizo & egg, and bacon tacos which were pretty generous. It also came with crispy home potatoes which were pretty good. I couldn't finish all that food though.  If you're a beer fan, they're HUGEEE here--perfect for rooting your favorite sports team on with the HUGE monitors. I opted for a mango frozen margarita which I thought was delicious...but looked kind of sad relative to the ginormous beer mugs and mimosa towers around me.  Overall, they have pretty good food, large monitors, and large beers here.  It's not the place to be if you want to sit and enjoy a quiet casual dinner. But definitely come with a group if you're down to enjoy a beer and to watch the game with music blasting around.",

However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos.  The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip.",

We tried this on a Saturday night around 9pm and were lucky to get one of the last booths available. Once seated our waitress was a real trooper - she kept all 5 of us in food and drinks for about two hours (and the place was slammed). They mostly offer small plates and a few select entrees. Food is above average quality, and affordable.   Here's the rub: This is really more of a restaurant than a bar, more about eating/drinking with a group of friends than a date night or party scene. The good news is that when you finish dinner there are dozens of nightlife options in walking distance. Personally I think they should turn the upstairs patio into more of a bar.   *I hear happy hour here is awesome.",

In my experience that usually means indifferent service and overly thought out food.  But the food, drinks, and service at RnR won us over.  We went for happy hour. We walked in around 6:30 to pounding house music and gorgeous twenty somethings that were obviously laying around the pool all day. Loud music and food don't usually mix well for me when it is still daylight.  The hostesses were very friendly and our server was great. He was much more down to earth then I thought service here would be. He was wonderful in describing the menu and making suggestions.  My husband had the animal fries and the ahi tacos. His eyes almost bulged out of his head when the fries came. As a vegetarian I was slightly repulsed by this carnivorous mess of a plate, but he was in pig and potato heaven. He liked his tacos too but was slightly annoyed he can eat them in 3 bites.  I had the portabello sandwich. It was good but not great. The bread was too thick and got soggy very quickly by the watery marinade of the mushroom. I definitely want to try something else out next time we go. The parmesean fries it came with were heavenly.   Drinks were good and priced awesome for happy hour. I had a mango pepper margarita. I liked the first few sips but there was something about the flavor I didn't like. My husband thought it was delicious and finished it for me.  If we are in the area we will definitely stop by RnR again. I want to try their boozy Sunday brunch.",

However, this place is great for brunch on Sundays because they have bottomless bloody marys and mimosas. Just be prepared to wait quite a while for a table as they fill up fast here on the weekends.  Also, not really a family establishment. Last time I was here, a girl got so drunk by 11 am that she started dancing on the bar.",

    "text": "First I set downstairs. Struck up a conversation with another single woman. We both set at the bar wanting white wine. The bartender knew nothing about wine or what was stocked. The hostess later provided a cheap looking but creative wine list on strips of paper. They stock a number of reds and whites but none I nor the other woman was familiar with. I prefer Chablis but they don't stock any. So I decided to try the house margarita. Listen closely.... Avoid it! It doesn't taste anything like a margarita, they serve it in their regular cocktail glass and they limit you to two of them. I could not suck it down and I can usually drink just about anything that's a cocktail that I set my mind to with a few exceptions. Mark this as a new exception.   Further more the young bartender did not know what he had on hand. I ordered a Canadian Whiskey and 7 up. He poured and tried to get me to drink a Chivas Regal & 7! The Canadian Club and Seagram Seven was in plain sight!   Our party decided to move upstairs and it took the bar 25 minutes to combine 3 tabs to be paid on one credit card!   Upstairs the waiter decides to card me! Come on I'm old enough to be your mother! He backs down. But when the other female in our party of now four orders a round of shoots for us it takes more than 30 minutes to get them. Because our waiter felt she was tipsy, I'm told when I track him down.   We looked at the menu but nothing was appealing, not even the font choice of the menu! Worst menu I have ever seen in a new establishment. If not the worst ever. Everything is overpriced. Happy hour consist of half off drinks and $1 off small plates! One dollar! Why bother?   The host/hostess furthermore kept people waiting at the door at 5pm when there was a number of tables in sight, as well as the majority of the bar. None of us understood that. The restrooms are located on the main floor only and the women's room is a major track to the entry should you need to go, so beware if you are upstairs! The upstairs is not accessible to anyone who can not climb a flight of steep stairs by the way. Many say they like the building but I personally find nothing about it appreciative. They proudly boast that it was built from the ground up for this purpose & use. Being an ex- architect student, take my opinion for free... it's a crappy design! The excessive outdoor seating is nice for a few months out of the year but soon 3/4 of their seating will be avoided due to the AZ heat or seasonal rainstorms. Also the color scheme of gray on gray isn't very inviting.   I chuck this up to been there, done that. I will not be returning. After all why?  Menu sucks, drinks sucks, service sucks, seating sucks.",

I haven't either, but if i had, this would be that friend.  Considering that this place boasts its presence with being right in old town Scottsdale you think they would have experience, food, and service.   I contemplated 1 star but that would be unfair to the first server who did a great job.   Shall we continue? Upon arriving they seemed busy inside and didn't have a table ready. My party had already been sitting and waiting for awhile when the rest of us arrived. They had 2 small children and 1 pregnant woman. Let's have them sit outside without water for awhile. Thats what we did. Finally a server came over and brought us water promptly.  Kind of a big deal to not be aware of your waiting patrons (especially if all you have is outdoor waiting in ARIZONA.)   Once seated, server came over, said hi and left. (i don't know why the rest of my party left their waters outside, i brought mine in). She never brought over or asked us if we would like waters. I guess seeing one cup for 8 people is sufficient.  Well 10 minutes later a group walks in same size and sits in the booth across from us. As we wait for our server to come back and take our order 20-25 minutes later, she instead goes to take the order of our neighbors. Um hi..we are waiting still.   After long awkward anticipation of trying to \"flag her down\" (granted she could have been busy, but she was chatting with the hostesses a lot, so who knows) she comes over and takes our long awaited dinner orders..we are striding along 45-50 minutes to take our order. When the other group was promptly attended to (10-15min). Oh heck yes i really was timing..   Order goes, 10 minutes  later appetizers come out and 1hr later (yes i realize it takes awhile to get food out especially 8 dishes) our dinner comes, or i think it is our dinner. We had 3 messed up orders. 3 overly cooked burgers..i tasted them it was so dry not even drink our 1 cup of water between 8 people could re hydrate that.  I mean i am a guy, most things can be fixed for me with just a GOOD (not even great) meal. But they couldn't even capitalize on that.. I am pretty sure a \"good\" meal could have come through better.  Heh, my meal was some chicken sandwich, thank God it was cooked all the way through. It was definitely slopped together. There was a GLOB of sundried tomatoes placed only in the middle, showing me that they cared so much to just ladle out the st's. I mean it was okay, but nothing i'd pay that much.  Hey i am a nice guy, lets talk about our neighbors.. by the time we got our food they were done eating and paying for their bill (they had 7 people). hmmm  i could go on, but really...whats the point? you get the idea...i wont be back",

There was a DJ spinning some old school favorites (think Arrested Development - Mr. Wendal, Next - Too Close, etc.) and most everybody there was groovin' a little at one point or another.    After checking in on Yelp, I claimed an offer for a half-priced drink and went with the 4-beer sampler...every one of them was enjoyable.  Everyone's food smelled amazing, although I didn't eat anything myself.  We were celebrating a friend's birthday and they brought out a GIGANTIC Cinnabon with candles for her.

There's both indoor and outdoor seating and its definitely a place to start the night before heading out for the Scottsdale club scene.  The service was quick and very good. I had the sirloin steak sandwich with sweet potato fries while others in my party tried various burgers and salads. My sandwich was excellent and others enjoyed their food as well. The fries are served in a small bucket and reminded me of the ones at Delux Burger.  The only reason RnR loses a star is that once the football game ended, the music was turned up so loud that it was practically impossible to hear the people at my own table.   I can see turning up the music later in the evening, but we were there on Sunday night and the NFL playoff game ended at about 6:00 which still strikes me as the dinner hour and it was disconcerting to have the music get so loud so early.",

    "text": "I was disappointed in this place because it looks like a cool spot from the outside. It was a Sunday night - Labor Day weekend when we stopped in. Visiting from out of state, we had been up early and spent the entire day in Sedona, so when we got back in town we wanted a more low-key place to get drinks and some food. Searching online we saw that this place specifically boasted that it had \"50% off late night eats after 11pm\" on Sunday nights. Perfect.   We arrive and it is dead. Ok, it is on the outskirts of the party scene going on further downtown, so maybe that should've been expected. The hostess awkwardly asks if we'll be drinking tonight. We sit outside, they have the music bumping pretty loud, and the couches and oversized chairs are actually pretty comfy... oh, and then there's that sloppy wasted girl sitting one lounge area away from you giving her boyfriend a lap dance and dancing around their table like a stripper. Really?   Anyways, we order food (sliders and chicken \"lollipops\") and a couple drinks. The sloppy girl and her man eventually leave, and 45 minutes later our 2 small appetizers finally come out. It wasn't til about 30 minutes after we ordered that our waitress came up to apologize and say she was sorry the food was taking so long, but that right as we arrived they had actually closed down the kitchen, so when we and the table who arrived shortly after us ordered, they had to get everything in the kitchen back out. Seriously? I know it's not the waitresses fault, but why would you not mention that when we ordered. Also, why are you going to advertise your special on Sunday nights being \"late night eats starting at 11pm\" when apparently you decide to close your kitchen down at that same time? I understand when it's a slow night eventually someone has to make that call and say you're going to go ahead and close early... but if that's the case, mention it when we get there instead of making us feel awkward and like we're burdening you ask you clean up everything around us and basically shut the place down waiting for us to get finished eating. The food was ok, but the 45 minute wait spoiled it.",

I was very disappointed by the food, the service seemed meh, and the DJ's music selection was all over the place (could be a good thing) but he chose all of the bad songs from their respective genre. I had the vanilla bean pancakes and they were dry and tasted a little like the bread you get at church. My friends had the green chili pulled pork tacos and pulled pork platter which they found to be very bland.   There are many places you can go for brunch, this has sadly fallen to the bottom of my list.",

    "text": "My maiden voyage to RnR started off shaky; my SO and I almost turned around when we first opened the door because there was an annoying DJ who was just loud as hell. Who thinks this is a good idea for Sunday morning, when all the poor, the downtrodden, and the hungover venture out for breakfast? I thought the club closed at 2 am last night.  Despite the dance remixes of Bon Jovi and too-cool-for-you crowd predominantly in their early 20s, Grandma and Grandpa decided to stay and indulge in some sundried tomato and goat cheese scrambled eggs, Chambord French toast, coffee, and Bloody Marys. I fully admit that the strip of bacon shoved in the Bloody Mary is totally surprising and off-putting for a vegetarian, but it is certainly creative. The Bloody was tasty, but slightly bland and nothing special. The scrambled eggs and hash browns (well done, natch) were huge and delicious, with plenty of tender sun dried tomatoes, but I had to save room for French Toast Mountain.   Good thing I did, and it's a damn good thing Fatty wore her stretchy jeggings, because I slurped my half of the French toast down and practically licked the plate clean. It was, bar none, the best French toast I have EVER had. Stuffed with sweet cream cheese, drenched in boozy raspberry sauce, and crowned with great fluffy piles of fresh whipped cream, it was a flavorful little orgasm on a plate.   Despite the remix of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" (poor Kurt is SPINNING in his grave) and slightly questionable service (forgotten English muffin), we will be back -- but only on a day when we have nothing else to do but lay around the house, buzzed and in a lethal food coma.... just YUM.",

We ordered the chicken lollipops and the shrimp appetizers. They were so small, we each only got one, which was unexpected. The chicken wasn't very good, but the shrimp was really yummy. The prices were ridiculous for drinks (I ended up getting a bottled beer) and their tiny apps, plus our waitress was virtually nonexistent. What's worse is that the music was set so loudly that I couldn't hear my friend across the coffee table. We were constantly shouting \"WHAT??\" every five minutes, which is really annoying after a point. Not a great location for chit chatting on the patio with friends at night. Next time I think I'll try talking my friends into RA instead.",

We  had a fairly large group and went for mimosa brunch hour on a Saturday. I was told it was $14 bottomless mimosas so I didn't order food, plus I wasn't hungry. The waiter seemed slightly overwhlemed with the size of our group but they food came out quickly and everyone seemed pleased with their dishes. The place was refreshingly cool and swamp misters kept the outside diners relieved as well. The crowd was all types and I experienced that in the bathroom toom which looked like it belonged in a campground, but oh well.  Turns out you only get the $14 bottomless deal if you order food... so basically they want you to spend at least $23 on brunch. I dunno, doesn't seem like that great of a deal. I would go back if it truly was a flat $14 bottomless deal or if someone else was paying for me.",

Service was not terrible, but given the fact the dining room was relatively empty, it should have been better.  And while I appreciate the tasting menu (that would be the sauce no one bothered to wipe off), we went with just drinks and dirty chips.  My white sangria was just okay.  The\"dirty chips\" (house-made potato chips topped with wing sauce, ranch dressing, bleu cheese, and bacon) were also okay, but the chips themselves were overly browned for my taste and there was entirely too much wing sauce on that plate.  It made me want a piece of chicken to dip in there.   Not bad, but nothing left me wanting to rush back, although their breakfast menu is appealing.",

It tries to be a wine bar but the wine list is very limited. We ordered the ordinary nachos which were decent and I also had the grilled  chicken sandwich which I ended up just eating the  chicken breast.  we went on a weekday so it might be different on the weekend but if u want a wine bar or a regular bar or a place to have a nice meal there are better options. the owners need to figure out what their concept is because it just left us confused and frustrated.",

RnR is one of my new favorite places that mirrors a trendy spot in the Village in NYC.  Upon turning the corner and seeing it's beauty, I was immediately in love.  Once on the other side of that by and beautiful wooden door, I was greeted by a lovely young lady with a pink bang and barely there outfit with great customer service skills.  We arrived too late to experience the $15.00 bottomless mimosa brunch but just in time for happy hour! Bingo!!!!!!  The menu had some unique choices and we opted for animal fries, which was about 1/2 pound of pulled pork over French and Sweet potato fries covered in herbs and aged cheddar cheese, and ahi tuna tacos which were good enough to order again.  As for drinks, the margaritas were banging!!!!!! My friend had a pineapple margarita and then a glass of the Alaskan Amber Ale on tap (good damn beer) and , I had a mango and a chipotle pineapple margarita.  They were amazing, each in their own ways and they were $4.00 each! The beer I think was $2.00.  I will definitely be back here as often as possible but next time with a Designated Driver and an IV filled with H20 so that I can simultaneously hydrate my poor body!  Oh, and the service was pretty good for them to be so busy taking care of drunk people who just want to have fun, me and my friend included!  The music was amazing as well, I almost created my own dance floor! Maybe next time I will!!",

When RnR opened up and offered the bottomless drinks with brunch it seemed like everywhere in old town followed suit (no complaints). It's best to come here with the intention of day drinking or when you had a late night the night before and you're looking for some shampoo effect action. I don't think the food is really very good at all (hence the 3 stars), but I look past it for the mimosas. Some servers are really good about filling up the bottomless drinks a lot and some aren't, in which case you just have to remind them, or chug every time they come to your table. Staff has always been really friendly when I've gone. Advice though...if you're not feeling like getting your drink on at breakfast, you're gonna hate yourself for going, hate all of your friends, and never want to go back (at least that's what I hear). Get here as early as you can though, or else you will be waiting a while and the clock will be ticking for the bottomless mimosa cut off. I've had a lot of fun times here.   Bottom Line: You're gonna be drunk, it's gonna be loud, and hopefully you didn't make any plans for productivity the rest of the day.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped by for lunch on a Wednesday. There were patrons at about 6 of the tables in the bottom section. We sat on the patio right at the edge of the inside to get some of the air conditioning. Our server was available but I wouldn't say overly attentive. She disappear a time or 2 during our lunch, but she was never gone too long. Since the restaurant is right on a well traveled road and there is an open concept, it does get a little loud from car traffic.  I think the term gastropub is an exaggeration for RnR. The menu is fairly small with only 3 main entrees. It is focused more on salads, sandwiches and small plate offerings with some unique side dishes. They do use some unique ingredients in their recipes, but gastropub? With that said, the burgers that my wife and I received were up there with the best burgers we've had in some time. I had the Bleu Cheese Burger and my wife had the Southwest Burger. My burger had bleu cheese (obviously) but the crimini mushrooms and bacon were delicious on the thick, perfectly cooked beef paddy. The green chili on the southwest burger provided a little bite to cut the richness of the beef patty and guacamole. The SW burger was also cooked to near perfection. The parmesan fries were also quite tasty. RnR also has some unique beers on draft, but $7 a draft is quite pricey.  I'd definitely go back, if not for the burgers, to try other menu options.",

Then I got even more excited when I saw on the board, Sat & Sunday Funday with the SF Giants logo! Of course I'm a huge Bay Area fan so automatically this place gets extra brownie points for representin'! :) My home away from home!  We were here for brunch with a few friends. The atmosphere is energetic and lively! I would caution against bringing kids or anyone who hates loud music. It's reminiscent of the party brunches in NYC, but with a sports flair and a more laid-back atmosphere. There are a multitude of TV panels so you can catch whatever sport your heart desires! Service was great, very friendly servers!   We ordered Animal Fries and the Chambord French Toast. The food is rather heavy so you certainly have to have a ravenous appetite or be in the mood for it.  But because of the Bay Area representation, it deserved 5 stars in my book!!",

There was another gentleman at the downstairs bar that was outside that was amazing. He and JJ deserve a raise or a promotion. For management if you care about your business I do believe there must be a better way to deal with seating at this venue. From my perspective the entire checking in process was pointless. I was one of many who sat at an open table because of how poorly the hostess were doing regarding seating. Even when I let the hostess know I had found a seat at the bar she didn't remove my name from the list which goes to show the seating process that RnR has is extremely flawed.",

    "text": "Ahhhh RnR.  The only place in Scottsdale I've been to where I've had champagne spilled on me repeatedly by hammered 20 something year old girls at 10AM, watched a dude throw up in the urinal by 10:30AM and then almost get into a fight with the drunken friend of the aforementioned champagne fairy by 11AM.  My experience was probably fueled by their bottomless drinks.  The music is oftentimes obscenely loud dance/electronic which I don't necessarily mind.  I'd say the service is extremely hit or miss here.  You have the typical \"I'm a server in Scottsdale and that somehow makes me important\" slow to do anything waiter that takes 20min to get your drinks, 45 to give you your now cold food and quickly gives you your tab assuming you'll tip at very least 20% because god knows that downtown Scottsdale apartment with 3 of their friends ain't going to pay for itself.  Oh and the annual Instagram trip is coming up and god knows those are expensive.  The food is similarly hit or miss, but typically pricey for what it is.  I've had a great burger there and then seen some items come out they couldn't pay me to eat.  I think you go here if you're looking to people watch, get into a fight with drunken post teens, bro out with your ho out.  I wouldn't come here for a relaxing brunch with friends.",

We were not being difficult, demanding, or obnoxious so I was really confused why she was so rude to us. Our server, while friendly, was incredibly slow and seemed to ignore us. The table next to us got their drinks before we even ordered ours. It took over 20 minutes and two trips to ask if we could order for her to finally come around to take our drink order. This was a special occasion and so the fact that we couldn't even order drinks to celebrate was very frustrating.   The music is so LOUD that you can't hear anything. I understand that it's part of the atmosphere but I really didn't expect the music to be that loud. The food was good but that was about it",

I can hear your belly I say we start to order! Take me to the RnR tonight  The RnR is the only bar with an upper deck on Scottsdale Road; point is you can't miss it!  Parking can be a headache here so I would definitely recommend finding a spot in one of the lots on the East end.    The RnR is a pretty hip place.  It has that industrial feel since everything reminds me of a steel factory inside, minus the sparks and welding mask!  They generally have live music or DJ on site, which is pretty cool.    Nightly food and drink specials!  I came on a Tuesday night so it was purchase a plate of bruschetta and your bottle of wine cost $15.  Not a bad deal I guess, but I hate to just stick to wine all night.  RnR is so far the only place I notice with Beer cocktails; if you don't know look it up. Supposedly, this is a hot new thing to do.  Beer with a mix of liquor.  I myself so far am not a fan since I like my beer ... beer and my cocktails ... well you get the point.  However, I would recommend you try and let your palates do the judging.    Along with the bruschetta, we ordered some Hangover Fries, Brussel Sprouts, Ahi Tacos, and finally a burger.  We didn't think the Hangover Fries was that great, but we've had the Animal Fries before and they were much better so I would stick with that.  The Brussel Sprouts I would have them fried with the bacon; has more taste that way.  The Ahi Tacos were the highlight of the nights.  Nicely seared tuna on a jicama tortilla!  YUMMY!  I think I could eat 50 of these and be satisfied!  The burger itself was okay at best.  However, this place is definitely a burger joint since half the menu was burgers or sandwiches.    Overall, a cool experience and a hip place to hangout.  I think the live music is cool and the service was good!  If you need a place to hang, well you found one! - Enjoy!",

As we were walking in that direction, the music just kept getting louder, Louder and LOUDER. Good music, but LOUD. Couldnt even hear myself talk. Lol it was SO packed! Ppl spilling out onto the sidewalk. Butt to butt- hip to hip! Ppl bumping into you like crazy. We were told the wait was an hr for a table and so we decided to wait it out near the bar where we eventually got our mimosas. Some batches better than others. After waiting over an hour, we checked w the hostess and thats where we were informed we still had 10 ppl in front of us!! We left. Obviously the waitlist system needs some work. It made no sense! We werent able to try the food. Def a college bar/club/rave were ppl sat at tables and just drank! Maybe ill try this place out again on a weekday while folks are at school. Idk.",

The dressing was amazing....I'd love to have some stocked in my refrigerator for daily consumption! We had great service at RnR and the atmosphere was awesome. There are other items that look vegan-friendly: veggie tacos, sweet potato fries, seasonal fruit bowl and the portobello mushroom sandwich (minus the aioli).

On the patio you get a good mix of things to look at:  * Old Town regulars (People walking around this joint are pretty much Arizona's version of Jersey Shore.)   * Then you get your out of town dudes who stopped here after 18 holes and are now trying to nail 18 hoes.  Stop dude, your Titleist hat does nothing for these bitches... you need your GTL and blowout hair. Duh.   *  Then theres the bullit biker bar across the street. Thank goodness you put straight pipes and ape hangers on your 86 Harley, otherwise i might not have noticed how freaking awesome you are!  Keep the ZZ Top thing going, it really works for you Grizzly Adams.   The food is pretty tasty, the drinks arent bad.  They carry Effin vodka, many places dont, so thats a bonus.    First time i was here, someone at the bar asked if RnR was owned by the same people that own the Vig. Bartender said: no, but we get that question all the time.  Its similar in some ways, but wasnt sure why. Last time i was there, i figured it out!  The sink in the mens room is exactly the same as the one in Vig uptown... Its not yer average sink... orange, on a slant, very mod.  It stands out.   VIOLA!",

Reasons to go: the sweet tots, decent food, and a very beautiful restaurant, contemporary and great view of Scottsdale rd. Reasons not to go: kind of pricey for the portion size, unorganized wait staff, and no hostess at the hostess stand....ever. Throughout our lunch I kept looking at the hostess stand and no one was ever there except to wave us goodbye as we were leaving. About the unorganized wait staff, our waitress asked another waitress to bring our the last plate to our table and we watched her do a lap around the restaurant before she realized it was for our table.   The service was alright, but it should have been exceptional considering it was after the lunch rush. I got the grilled chicken sandwich. It was tasty, but I'd rather go to Olive & Ivy for a WAY bigger portion with the same great taste, save a few bucks, and free bread/pesto.    The drink menu looked fun, but on my lunch hour wouldn't have been the best time for it.",

It was kinda BBQ-y, kinda asian-y, and very oily. It was bizarre. My bf ordered the BLT with avocado which he says was pretty good. Garlic fries were supposed to come with his meal but we got cold regular fries that had no flavor. Yuck! On the other hand, service was great!",

We each ordered margaritas - I got one with chambord and my friend got a strawberry margarita. Upon first sip I couldn't understand the TWO drink limit in such a small margarita, but as I had more, I really could taste the alcohol. A little strong for me, but overall fairly tasty.   We each ordered sandwiches. She got a chicken, brie, sundried tomato sandwich... I was envious of it, but I don't eat chicken so I ordered the veggie sandwich. A decent sandwich, but nothing to write home about. I'd probably try something else next time. We shared the sweet potato fries and parmesan chips... both very good! We were surprised at the generous portions of each too.   The outdoor patio is right up on Scottsdale Rd and is across from the Billet Bar which made for a ton of motorcycle and traffic noise. Kind of annoying at times, but I could deal with it.   I read a few reviews about it being pricey. Go for happy hour... much better prices.",

Unfortunately we had a little weasel of a server, who, I think was new to the waiting game. He really didn't have a way with people and seemed incredibly paranoid about who was on which tab, where people in our group were going. We explained that we were there to watch the game, he had credit cards on all the tabs. We weren't going anywhere. It was very annoying.   But the rest of the service was good. It seemed to be well staffed and some people I was with ordered some apps and said they were good. The food looked good, so I'll be back to try it one day.

Great server.  The patio is amazing for people watching.  Couches, tables, and room to stand/drink.  The food is delicious. Try the Animal Fries and the Pulled Pork Hash.    The drinks are ridiculously good.  I can't get over how good of a deal the bottomless mimosas are.  The DJ is awesome and it feels like every time you take a sip of mimosa, it's full again.  That's the recipe for a perfect Sunday Funday.  Bring your party pants, and get there early.  See ya next time!",

We got our drinks right away, can't beat a $15 bottomless mimosa special. But my friend had to hunt someone down more than once to refill her coffee/water.   The server took our order right away but after 35 minutes we were wondering where our food was. He forgot to put in the order & we ended up waiting another 15 minutes. By the time our food came it was cold (French toast & breakfast sandwich).   The food wasn't that great, but it also wasn't too pricey...definitely not worth the long wait & feeling completely ignored.   Oh and someone dropped a plate with meat while clearing a table behind us. Glass & food was all over the floor for about 20 minutes, even though members of the staff were walking over the plate to get back inside.   Won't be coming back or recommending to friends.",

I am somewhat of a baked-pretzel connoisseur. I ordered the pretzel bites with mustard and wow. Not only were they served differently than any other pretzels I've tried but they were absolutely delicious and the stone ground mustard was DEVINE. My boyfriend even used some on his sliders (which were also really good). The staff was energetic, really friendly and very attentive. We asked if they could put the Broncos game on and they did. We were very happy with our experience! I didn't get any of the staff names but we were there on Saturday, August 29th between 7pm and about 8:30pm. We sat at the bar.",

    "text": "I loved it here. I almost took a star away for slow service from Melissa, but...eh.  DJ, no cover, tons of fun. Someone even brought their baby in here so Im not sure what the rules are. Weirded me out actually, even though the baby had a faux hawk. We started around 2pm and carried into 7pm in the patio. The seating is great, be it cushioned patio chairs, or taller chairs and tables. I got their bloody mary, and it was my first one ever (TEE HEE.) It had a celery stalk in it, stuffed olives, and....a strip of bacon. FREAKING oh my it was so good. So I had about 4 and didnt feel too buzzed. I couldnt taste the alcohol so either it was very well made, or I liked them because they didnt have any alcohol in them at all lol. from 3pm-7pm there was HappyHour, even on Saturday! $5.99 appetizer menu which included sliders, ahi tacos, and other things I cant remember. The Ahi tacos are done in a gourmet'ish fashion. Its not on a tortilla, rather, a slice of jicama (which is spelled incorrectly on their happy hour folds) It was delicious! And Ive got beef with their sliders because the meat to bun ratio was laughable. It was like a meatball inside a burger bun. But veryyyyy tasty. Lastly, their jalapeno mac & cheese was tasty and so popular with our party. I agree, but the heart burn wasnt fun. About Melissa's service...having been a waitress I know its rough handling large parties. We were rolling in the twenties! Nonetheless, her attentiveness was noticeably poor. When I went to find her inside the restaurant to tell her my order, she looked annoyed. Meh. Anyway, my bill after 6 hours of drinking and eating was $50. WHa wha wha whaaaaaaaaat??  I wish I could take these bloody mary drinks home with me!",

A dj spinning from the early AM, bottomless mimosas all around and plenty of flat screens so you don't miss ANY of your fantasy football players at any moment.       This place is loud, rambunctious and you should be prepared to be around a lot of day drunk partiers---which can be a blast if you're in the right mood. Seating is spacious and their patio is nice, but at such a club-like place, the bonus is that their food is actually good. They have a sundried tomato and goat cheese scramble that I've tried to veer away from but am too in love with. Their protein pancakes with apple butter are great for the health conscious types (or those regretting their weekend shenanigans).   The wait here can get long, but if they have their platter of gummy bears on hand, it can make the hungover hunger a little more manageable. In the long run, this is a fun place to check out, even if it's just once!",

    "text": "This seems to be the place to see and be seen for the young and the trendy. It was always crowded when we walked by, but the blasting music and stylish crowd at night made it a tough sell for many of my coworkers. So, I went on my own, opting to stretch my per-diem to the max at happy hour.  It was love at first sip of that black IPA on draft. Then there was the ahi tuna tacos. These dainty little tacos come out on a seemingly silly slice of jicama, almost too pretty to eat. But I checked my ego and ate them whole, and was immediately blown away by the fresh, bright flavor. This was a big deal for me, as I typically avoid eating fish in land-locked states. Impressed, I also ordered the burger sliders. Sadly, they were dry and an overall disappointment.  With those tuna tacos still on my mind, the table was set for a second visit. For round 2 I opted for a more manly snack: the animal fries. Snack? This proved to be more of a meal. And lets be honest - this dish is nothing less than food porn, the likes of which I used to fantasize about as a collegiate stoner. A plate of not 1 but 3 kinds of already-bad-for-you fries, topped with a mound of hearty pulled pork and smothered with 2 kinds of melted cheeses and bbq sauce. Believe me, It was even more awesome than it sounds, even if the cheese was a bit sharp for my taste.  So then I saw the breakfast menu online, and imagined curing a Sunday morning hangover with some breakfast tacos. Fast forward to that weekend - Im not exactly sure what happened St Pattys day/night, but when I woke up Sunday am, RnR was packed with a solid1.5-2 hr wait. Needless to say, I never got the chance to sample breakfast. Alas, there will be another trip in a few months, and Ill be back.",

Aside from that, the margaritas were delicious and not too sweet, the prickly pear was my favorite. They have an awesome happy hour that includes half off drinks and I hear the mimosas are delicious. Included in the happy hour were food deals, so I went with the pretzel bites. I wasn't impressed because they were sliced and I was expecting poppers, but the grainy mustard paired well with it.",

My sweet potato fries were amazing. Some of the best I've ever eaten. Crispy and seasoned perfectly.  Boyfriend said burger was ok and his healthy side of berries were yummy.

And get a little tipsy during happy hour...it sounds like a sweet deal!  I love the patio.  Our waiter was great...super personable (apparently I'm not because I don't recall his name) and was really good at explaining the specials, happy hour and tempting us with dessert.  Boyfriend was hungry (what's new) so we started with the chicken lollipops (basically boneless buffalo wings on sticks - i had one, as Boyfriend's weakness is wings, and they were normal wing tasting) and some parmesan fries.  it's safe to say I have a slight fry obsession...these were definitely tasty.  A lot of seasoned fries are just too much...these had a pretty perfect amount.  I got the ahi tacos for my meal...decent, and a perfect small portion for me.  The tortillas are not tortilla tortillas as most arizonans would expect, but i thought the jicama was a refreshing twist and paired well with the cold ahi.  Boyfriend got the burger and he scarfed it down before I think I even asked how it was.  A huge plus for me - our server was very attentive, keeping our water glasses constantly full (which meant refilling like 17 times).  He offered dessert, and we said no...oh, wait...no...brownie a la mode, you say? umm...yes, we must. get. brownie.  I noticed the brownie and ice cream is not on the regular menu on the website.  Not sure what that is about but it was amazing.  And we both take our desserts very seriously.  It wasn't super fudgy or cold like a lot of restaurant brownies are...it was warm, soft, crumbly and just totally scrumptious.  there definitely was a small fork fight for the last few bits of brownie and chunk of ice cream...  Their breakfast menu and delicious sounding coffee sound even better than our dinner, so I think I'll have to get up and ride my bike down there in the morning sometime soon.  Good breakfast can sometimes be hard to find...a lot of their offerings sound both healthy and yummy.  Overall, totally decent place to hang out on the patio and nosh on some small plates and drink, or enjoy the cooling weather (maybe...soon?) with a coffee.  Yay RnR!",

    "text": "Went to RnR to watch the Hawks lose to Ohio State yesterday... (boo to that).   We were directed to a PERFECT patio seat right away and the server had no problem changing the flat screen to ABC so we could see our game. The seating is really comfty, great for enjoying a nice day, a few bevs and a football game.  The food was totally mediocre in my opinion... we split the dirty chips and wow-zaas... they were over the top (but I guess that's the concept so kinda my fault here). They came out looking awesome - great presentation, but after a few bites I was spent. It's the kind of food that sticks with you all day and you think about them later in the day and get totally grossed out. I would NOT have these again, but Matt probably would.  We split the RnR burger which was just OK too.  I'd love to try this spot for breakfast, some of the dishes passing by us looked pretty delish. I'd also like to try their salads.  All in all, I think this is the kind of place you go for the great patio on a beautiful, not necessarily the food.",

The meat is on the thick side so I ended up eating about 2/3rds of it. I got the half and half sweet potato/normal fries and they were ok. The only negative was that it took a while to get the food.   It seems like a bar hangout at night.",

    "text": "Came for brunch b/c of gluten free offerings. Made it very clear to our server that I have Celiac Disease and needed corn torts instead of flour. My meal arrived with flour torts covering the plate. Explained that I needed the whole thing remade. A second server brought out my revised meal and, bless his heart, his girlfriend has Celiac so he understood my issue. He brought corn torts on a separate plate and let me know they were cooked on the same surface as the flour.  So I had to skip the torts. If you are going to have gluten-free offerings on your menu, your servers and your kitchen staff need to be well-versed on what that means or you are at risk for some very sick patrons. Gluten free dining is a fad for some, but for many it is a medical necessity. With their bottomless mimosas, DJ,  and multiple groups of bachelorette parties, this place has more of a night club vibe than a dining establishment.",

The service was horrible and slow, we had to chase down our server for our check and had to wait about 45 minutes for 1 burger and 3 salads, I'm guessing they had to butcher the cow in back or had to wait for the lettuce to grow. The place was not that busy so the fact that we had to wait that long for our food is unacceptable, not to mention we had to wait up front for the hostess to stop talking to her coworkers at the bar to come seat us. The food is way overpriced but in Scottsdale I guess that doesn't matter. It looks like a fun place from the outside but beware once you come in.",

It was not very busy so the 6 of us got a table right away.  The menu had a nice selection of salads and sandwiches, pretty much your standard fare for lunch. I ordered a salad that included strawberries, apples, walnuts and a strawberry dressing on mixed greens. I added chicken for $3 more.  The salad was a decent size and there was a lot of chicken which was great. I hate when places make you pay extra for a piddly scrap of food. The chicken was done well and the salad was fresh. Most of my co-workers had chicken sandwiches which they gobbled up quickly.  The service was pretty quick but our waitress was a little snotty. When one of my co-workers got his sandwich with mayo (which was not mentioned on the menu) and asked for a new bun, the waitress did get him another sandwich quickly but also had to point out (with attitude) that it was aioli not mayo. Umm...isn't aioli just a fancy word for mayo mixed with something? And why would you put mayo, ahem, aioli on a sandwich that had pesto? Whatever.   I would be willing to visit RnR again and try one of their sandwiches or burgers. But hopefully I'll get a different waitress.",

On Mother's Day, we chose RnR as our new place to try.  When we arrived, we were told it would be about 30 minute wait for a table.  Not a problem except that they ask for a telephone number to call when the table is ready and because the music and noise level is so loud, the hostess wrote down the wrong number.  When we finally got a table, they didn't give us any menus and we had to ask.  The server that brought the menus also took our drink order which was promptly delivered.  After that, we never saw another server!  We sat at the table for over 30 minutes waiting for someone to come take our order but no one showed up.  Since we had already waited 45 minutes to get seated, we were very hungry and decided that the first time at RnR would also be our last.  We left cash on the table to cover the drinks, got up and left.  Our 2nd choice was far more enthusiastic to have our business and we will definitely visit that place again, but RnR is off our list!",

Makes sense since the Giants Spring training park is a few minutes walk away. Most of the bars near by will show baseball but aren't really Giants bars.  This place is awesome I watch one of the World Series games here but was full of Giants fans. The food was amazing and the beer was cold.  I had the Devils Ale and a Moscow Mule.

Lunch took about 15 minutes to arrive which was surprising with only about 20 folks in the place. My 'medium' burger was definitely well done, as there was zero pink in the middle. The burger comes on a pretzel bun but with no condiments so it needed mayo, which took another 7 minutes.   The burger itself was tasty. Decent size but $13 was a bit steep. The sprouts were nicely Caramelized and had Caramelized onions and bacon. Good stuff there. My daughters burger was also over cooked ($15).

I wanted to do the bottomless mimosas, but like I said, no place ever gets it right and so many servers can't keep up with the refills. Sam at RnR CAN keep up with my impressive drinking skills! ;) Seriously though, he was so on top of everything and was quick to make great recommendations.  I ended up getting the most amazing pulled pork sandwich; it was to die for!   Sam was also helpful about getting me in the best seat to watch the Patriots game, which he did without disrupting anyone else!  He was amazing and when I come back (I plan on bringing out of town family in the near future) I will most certainly be requesting Sam- and a pulled pork sandwich! ;)",

    "text": "Been going here for the past 3 years and usually there is no seats and ask someone if we can sit with someone?  After I asked politely and a gentleman said no problem and introduced himself.  I said are you sure it's ok and he said yes.  Evidentially his girl friends brother was the General Manager / bouncer and she advised me that was her brother.  Sat there for 10 minuites and then he came by and I said can't order a beer he said no you can't sit at that table?  Hmm.  Then his fellow bouncer came over and evidentially though I was gonna need to be removed from the bar and was laughing.  I proceed to leave and there two more bouncers at the door laughing at me?  Hmm. I called the business card on the counter of the head chef and explained what happened never before?  He said that Tall blonde bouncer was the General Manager.  I asked do you think the owner would want to know of this poor service and he proceeded to say.  The owner owns almost all of down town south scottsdale?  Not quiet sure what that means.  We then went to the Vig great food service and no rude bouncers also acting as a General Manager.  They must really need 3 bouncers because the owner has so much money that he trains his General Manager to not give a crap about patrons.  And or laugh and possibly get visitors upset.  Stay tuned this manager is gonna show up again causing problems again.  Usually spend 95.00 for lunch here too?",

    "text": "RnR went from my all time favorite Sunday-Funday brunch location to the WORST place ever! Just like every weekend....I attended RnR to meet with a group of friends expecting a great time, however on \"Sunday, October 23, 2016\" those plans went south.   As soon as I got to the front door, my ID was verified for the drinking age, but I was immediately DENIED entry due to my shoes being \"high tops\". I wear the same brand of shoes with the majority of them being high tops, and have never had an issue, even at this location.   Here's the kicker...I had another guy friend(Caucasian), with the SAME style of shoes, just different color...walk up 5mins later & gain access with no questions asked. When I observed from a distance the \"bouncer\" just shrugged his shoulders & smirked at me. Once my friend was let inside, he and I asked why he was able to enter but I wasn't....the bouncers excuse was he \"didn't notice\" the height of the shoe. Again...they were the same style of shoes, different colors.   Personally I've never experienced this type of profiling in Scottsdale...It's such a shame how this type of discrimination is still going on. My relationship with this establishment has come to an end.",

I'm not old but the loudness of that music made us turn away because of the dangerous noise volume I'm sure they are hitting.  Reply: thank you so much for your reply, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to address my opinion. Now I do like lively places, I enjoy great music and having fun while eating and drinking, I'm usually the one dancing on the table, lol. But the noise level even the look on some of those people's faces were practically cringing trying to talk to others. And I saw little conversation which I'm sure is due to the fact that it was too much work to talk over the extremely loud volume. I was just excited to go back and have some fun with some family members but literally couldn't hear myself think.",

It gets packed so if you don't like crowds, loud music, or younger people then this might not be the brunch place you had in mind.  There's a DJ spinning on the weekends, everyone is having a good time drinking bottomless mimosas.  Tried the Bloody Mary, it was pretty alright, served with a piece of bacon.  The bottomless mimosas were a tad too juicy for my taste but good nonetheless.  The chips & queso were surprisingly very good!  The dirty chips were also very good!  The pulled pork & hash was underwhelming and not much flavor.  My friend had the tacos and they too looked underwhelming and dry. My other friend had the pulled pork sandwich and it looked really good.",

We order our food and 2 appetizers were missing after waiting 40+ min. She barely said sorry and finally got the appetizers after food was eaten. Our eggs were ice cold. No fault was taken and most companies would comp it. My tab had the drink an extra charge of 1.25 which I honestly don't care but when I asked she said idk it's a frozen margarita it's not a big deal it's a dollar. I would prefer not to be over charged and not explained why with attitude. Overall wouldn't recommend for okay food and horrible service.",

Backstory: when I originally called to make brunch reservations (a month prior) the hostess said let me get you a manager. I don't think we'll take reservations for a party that large on a Sunday. Me: no problem! *waiting on hold* manager comes to the phone and makes the reservation for me. So 20 people Sunday, July so and so!   Fast forward to 9 days before my actual reservation. I called to confirm the number in my party, the time and date. The hostess read everything back to me correctly!!   Fast forward again to the Sunday of!! I get there, along with 4 of my party of 20. The hostess is sorting through the book ... No reservation! They get a manger ... No reservation!! Within 20 mins they put together a table (section) for 20. Ironically we're located directly next to a party of 21 women  I went on and asked the ladies if they had a reservation. They said NO!! Their table had 21 people sitting there. Clearly .... This was my section!!! I'm convinced!!   So the manager out together our section which consisted of a table of 10 and 5 small tables for 2. We literally had to constantly tell people \"this is our section ... Yes the whole section\" the entire time we dined!!   I host a brunch or happy hour for my meetup group, anywhere between 8-25 people monthly. This was by far the worse experience!",

It was a hot day and I wasn't sure if a half open restaurant would be cool enough (we sat inside, it was cool enough).   1. Service: The service was outstanding.  Our server apologized that they were a bit short handed on a Monday lunch hour because of unexpected crowd size.  She again apologized a couple of times while we were waiting for our lunch and afterwards.  Here's the kicker, they were prompt at ordering, serving food, and other aspects of our visit.  The staff was really friendly and sincerely cared about their service.  2. Beer:  Great selection of local craft beer and the typical brews that you would expect to see on tap.    3. Sports: Almost an overload of TVs with every sport channel playing.  Since it was a Monday afternoon, most of the shows were talking heads reviewing Sundays football game.  Go Seahawks.  4 Food: The menu featured typical/expected food at a reasonable price.  It did feature a few \"Tex-Mex\" items that I normally do not see up north.  I will return, I will recommend to anyone visiting Old Scottsdale.",

Now, they put plain fries in the bucket and then shake a bunch of Parmesan on top. Little disappointing. We also had a larger group of people. Our waitress spent most of her time up at the bar talking when the restaurant had maybe 30 people. She came and checked on us a few times but we had a bunch of dirty plates piling up and water cups that she never refilled. She also added gratuity to our checks which I understand, with a large party, is normal however she did NOT deserve it which is why I knocked down two stars.

We called to make a reservation for an 18 person party a month in advance and called three days before the reservation to change the number from 18 to 25. They told us it wouldn't be a problem at all!  Well, WHEN WE GOT THERE THEY COULDN'T FIND THE RESERVATION.  They \"apologized\" but we had to pretty much wing it which left a bad taste on all of our mouths.  So...we got a table upstairs that seated 6, pushed another table that seated 4 next to it and had to have the rest of our guests sit away from everyone else at tables of two. It was a hot.mess. and we were not.happy.  The $18 bottomless mimosas were watered down.  They had a menu full of frozen margaritas but weren't serving any of them the morning we were there.  The food was below average. I ordered an omelette with potatoes, cheese, and avocado. It was super dry (overcooked) and ultra bland.

Quite honestly, I would have hated that place when I was 21 too. It's one of those kind of places ur friends try to convince u is cool but deep down, even tho u want to fit in, it's just not.   But because I was on a girls trip with my younger girlfriends, I went, having no idea just how laughingly horrible it would all be!!   I don't even write reviews but I truly feel the need to warn anyone who showed up so unaware of what was about to happen like i did!   First of all. The service. Jesus, she couldn't have been more vapid and inattentive. I realize waiting on women well beyond the cut off age there was pry not the highlight of her day, but guess what... middle aged women are pretty good tippers!  You didn't get the chance to find out because how many times did we have to track u down for a refill on the BOTTOMLESS mimosas? Here's a tip for ya. If ur at the bar waiting on a drink order, that would b a great time to take that pitcher in front of u, and maybe refill the tables right next to you! 1 min, tops!   The food. Blah! Ordered the pork hash. I think it was supposed to come with some chili sauce? It didn't and it tasted like absolutely nothing.  Don't even bother if u think ur going to get that satisfaction of a great hangover cure brunch choice. It's so bitterly disappointing, you will want to cry.   The ambiance: started out fun, upbeat. Before the food came, (and the shitshow to follow) I thought my friend had steered us to the perfect little brunch spot.   Give it an hour. Before u know it, your food sucks, your server goes MIA, and cue the DJ! You look around and suddenly it's a Sunday morning nightclub!  I'm still just so confused by this! Haha! Do 20 something's really find this fun??? It's such s stupid concept! Haha! I have a 25 year old. I know he would hate this as much as me! We would die laughing together at how insipid and comical it really is!  It was really topped off with the beaver shot we were forced to look at throughout our meal. As soon as our food showed up, so did a party of 4 with a \"lady\" wearing a romper from the little girls department that everything u can imagine was hanging out. My table, all waxing estheticians by trade takes a lot to shock or offend us... We. Couldn't. Stop. Dying over this!!! We will talk about it for years to come!!! Haha!  I guess I find it funny that I read the reviews of the \"strict\" dress code on jogging pants? But this is acceptable brunch attire? Whatever   So to sum it all up, if u have no mind of your own, don't care to actually converse with your friends over food, maybe you feel like the night before didn't go as planned and u need one more shot at taking someone home.... this is your place!  It certainly isn't for the food or the service or the laid back atmosphere.  Not mad... just thoroughly bemused and bewildered this exists and people come! Haha!   I should give myself one star for not knowing what I was about to step into.",

From the start I thought I would really enjoy the atmosphere. All the TVs playing the game were great. But when seated we got sat at a wobbly high top table. Even they knew because they tried to stuff napkins under to balance. Which was a fail. Our waitress was pretty. Never got her name. But literally no personality. She was not friendly and you could tell she either hated her job or didn't wanna be there. We got there right before happy hour ended so we put in a drink and appetizer order. It took her about 15 mins to come back with our drinks and then after that never checked back in until about 10 mins after we got our appetizer. And I would like to add it wasn't busy. Mind you, we were gonna order entrees. But at this point I was irritated because she walked by us a good 5+ times watching us eat and never asked how anything was or if there was anything else she could get us. I just didn't like her vibe at all. So we decided not to order any other food and go somewhere else. I was excited to try this place because I've heard good things. But seriously find pretty AND out going waitresses. Doubt we will be back. The queso was eh. I've had better else where. My beer tasted weird too. So food won't bring us back either.",

This is a brunch spot not a club, if I wanted to go to a club I would have just gone to the entertainment district in old town.

First of all, the amazing GM was able to give us a reservation on a Sunday during brunch when they typically don't do reservations. He was so kind and accommodating and it really made my roommate's birthday special.   We sat down and we all ordered the bottomless mimosa/bloody mary deal and let me tell ya, it's worth every penny. Both were delicious and well made - the perfect juice-to-alcohol ratio. I ordered the Amish french toast, and it was soooo good. My friends ordered the omelet, pork hash, pancakes, and a lot of other really yummy food. Everything I tried was delicious!   The atmosphere was loud and fun, which was exactly what I wanted for my friend's birthday. We all had so much fun! I will 100% be back and I am already telling all my friends to go if they haven't been already.   And again - THE SERVICE WAS AMAAAAZING. I can't get over how attentive and awesome our waitress was, as well as the rest of the staff. It was super busy but our drinks were always filled and everything came out perfectly.   11/10 recommend for a fantastic, fun Brunch spot.",

We were seated rather quickly for a Saturday football game night. The staff are cute young girls (they have to wear little tight black dresses, which is classier than hooters). Started our order with their chicken lollipops, they were fun to eat and had good flavor. The best dish I had was their ahi tacos- YUM and Healthy! Loved their twist on the tortilla and how they used jicama (super creative and clean) all the ingredients they used created a nice flavor. We also had the slider trio- great app to give you a little bit of everything our favorite was the bleu cheese slider.. they used grilled angus beef.  They had an ok wine selection but what we loved was that they properly stored their wines in a wine cooler at the correct temperature. Wished they had a little better selection but it's pretty decent for a sports bar to even have selections to choose from. They had a dj too that was spinning during the football commercials. It was a fun touch.",

Had luck both days with food, lunch the first and breakfast the second, the cinnamon roll is enormous. Crazy specials on mimosas and Bloody Mary's till 3 on weekends I believe is what I heard and they were definitely flowing.

And I'm not sure why they need a hostess at all (when her only job seems to be glowering at people).  Cmon people. Be happy, you live in Scottsdale!",

Along with your well tequila and pitchers of bud light, make sure to sure to order the house special: the southwest charcoal burger. This masterpiece is cooked to crispy perfection. Don't even worry about ordering it medium or rare. The talented cooks at R&R take extra care of the burger patty, providing that dark, toasty texture that we all crave.  Immaculate conception is an understatement; it evokes a natural smoky flavor resembling the time your aunt cooked those steaks and left them in the microwave for 2 hours.   R&R is on to something and we should all be grateful that mad cow isn't a problem anymore. I don't know that this is the first southwest charcoal burger ever cooked, but it definitely had that unique burnt flavor that will keep me coming back.

Espresso based drinks: Don't bother here. It tastes like it came from one of those push button deals. Just not worth the money.  Brunch: Sorta bland and middle of the road. I got the breakfast sammy and added avocado to it. It was OK but really small and lacking in flavor. I will say they gave a me a ton of avocado so good on them for that.  Service: We were upstairs and the service was pretty bad. Our waitress was nice but we found out drinks empty a lot and just felt overall that we should have been checked in on.  I know people rave about the brunch and bottomless champagne here but other spots have better deals and I saw that the mimosas were small and full of oj. I guess if you are in a larger group and get attention it is worth it, otherwise I would hit somewhere else up.  It its favor this spot does have a lot of people, and looks good for groups.

We were seated out on the upstairs patio, which was nice to be away from the big crowds, but was really, really far away from the restrooms! As the West sun began to set, it got a little hot, but then they put down the shades and the problem was solved!   The food just kept rolling out of the kitchen, my favorites were the crispy rock shrimp which had a kick to them, the mini pigs in blanket and the spinach artichoke dip. The pigs in the blanket were just your basic preparation, but how many places can you order these at a restaurant, and who doesn't dig pork and puff pastry? The spinach dip was creamy and delicious, but the chips could have been a bit better quality. We also sampled the cheese plate, all three kinds of sliders and the chicken lollipops.   We were stuffed at this point, but then came the platters of mini cheesecakes and carrot cakes....mmmm.   This is a cool new place in Old Town to hang out.....I will be back.",

Some items like the loaded chips were very tasty (although hold the blue cheese if you don't love that ingredient) while others missed like the chicken lollipops.  The drinks were good as the bloody mary's had the perfect spiciness level and the bacon condiment was a great touch.  The interior is very nice although I would say they have not made the full commitment to being a sports bar as they have a good number of tvs, but not quite the number you would want if you want to watch multiple at a time.  Overall this is a really good option in the area.  They have some kinks to work out but even still is a good experience for dinner, drinks or a game.",

I stopped by at lunch time and had fast/friendly service from the host and the girls behind the bar.  Another eye catcher was they serve breakfast until 2pm and the board out front seemed to have some decent happy hour specials.  A discount or special would be a plus.  The only concern seemed that the menu is a little pricey for the type of  food.  I tried the grilled chicken sandwich which is server on foccacia smothered with pesto and melted brie.  They do offer 3 different types of sides, parmesan fries, sweet potatoe fries, or chips.  Washed it down with a Coors light draft bringing a sandwich and a beer to $18 plus tip.  I'd be happy to go back for happy hour, but didn't think it was worth $21 bucks for lunch",

Our server was all over us pushing the drinks! She did a great job. Not sure I would want to come back to this place it's way to loud here!",

I haven't fully explored the menu yet but I'd recommend the Chicken Lollipops (ya I said that right) or the Animal Fries. Also they're specialty cocktails come with double shots, so you get your money's worth (at $13 a pop), but during happy hour they are half off too.  The atmosphere is pretty fun, with all the serves wearing Vans. It has a very modern feel, with lots of exposed metal and lounging areas. The main patio faces Scottsdale Rd, which gives the place a very urban feel, with people walking by. Oh and did I mention it has a second floor?",

A great place to hang out, enjoy the nice weather on the patio and have a few drinks some food maybe:).  After reading all the bad reviews for RnR I thought I would give it a shot today for lunch.  I was by myself so decided to sit outside at the bar on the first floor.  I really like the look of this place... it is open with lots of places to sit and enjoy the weather.  For lunch I decided on the grilled cheese & bacon with Parmesan fries.  It was not the best grilled cheese I have ever had but it was good and the fries were pretty tasty.   The restaurant is still chaotic trying to figure things out... I would definitely come back again... I might wait until they get their full menu figured out:).",

We walked in and the hostess was very friendly and informed us that there was about 10 minutes left on happy hour and that they had some great drink specials.  We went to the bar while waiting for a table, and were immediately served, even though it was busy, as it was Friday around 7pm.  We ordered 2 margaritas, which came out to $7 on happy hour.  Great start!  We then were seated shortly after.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese, and it was very good.  The fries were great as well.  Not a gourmet burger, but very large and tasty.  Better than your average sports bar burger.  Service was very good as well.  We always had a full glass even when it was packed.  They even changed the game to UofA for the pac-10 championship when requested.",

    "text": "I'm not a food critic by any stretch of the imagination, but with that being said this place aspires to be mediocre.  And that's saying something for Scottsdale.   The bar/patio/lounge have this industrial design thing going on which isn't that bad until you add in the music and the noise from Scottsdale road.    The prices are what you would expect to find in a \"trendy Scottsdale bar\" the problem is at most of those \"trendy Scottsdale bars\" you can get pretty good food and it's worth it, and normally there is some little twist that makes it worth it.  I can honestly say I've never paid $13 for a pork sandwich that tasted like it was KC Masterpiece mixed with recently thawed shredded pork (the sandwich lived up to the rest of bar is aspired to be mediocre).   The meal came with the choice of fries (regular/parmesan/sweet potato) I took the parmesan fries... I couldn't taste any hint of parmesan on the fries but there were white specs that I suspect were the parmesan in question.     The wait staff was attentive, but they were either very new or indiffrent.    While eating I saw multiple plates go back with food that wasn't even half eaten.  I literally watched the table behind me get their food and have it sent back less then three minutes and two bites later.   So aspirations of mediocre are as good as it gets here.   If this place survives the summer I will be impressed.  Do your self a favor and go a block in either direction and find a better \"trendy Scottsdale bar\" you will be happy that you did.",

    "text": "Warning: This review is solely based on Sunday Brunch... So from my experiences in Scottsdale so far, RnR is the prime spot for 'Sunday Funday'. They offer $15 endless mimosas and bloody Mary's with a food purchase. It's getting hard writing this review because I love food so much and the food here was absolutely delicious. I got the pulled pork hash with scrambled eggs and I couldn't even eat all of it because they give you so much food and my mimosa never sat empty in it's glass for more than a minute. The servers are very quick and efficient and make sure you always have what you need. All my friends also loved their food and service and have made RnR part of their Sunday ritual. There are plenty of TVs to watch sports throughout the entire establishment.   My recommendations for RnR are to go earlier in the day because the later you go the longer you are going to wait, because it really is a very popular spot in Scottsdale (the wait can get up to an hour or longer). Definitely get the endless Bloody Mary/mimosa deal and if you are waiting for a table you can order the deal at the bar, pay $25 and then they take $10 off your total food bill. Their breakfast entrees are very delicious and they give you a lot of food, so if you get the endless bm/mimosa deal you can expect to spend $25-35, which isn't bad for a Sunday brunch.   Overall loved my experience at RnR!",

    "text": "I will never go back to RnR. Everyone seems to have a good time, but I experienced the most traumatic, rude customer service situation that I have ever dealt with in my entire life. I get to the bar and planned on having brunch with my family of 6. We put our name on the list around 10:30, and never got a seat. Why waiting, we were forced to stand. Since it was warm in the building, my husband collapsed and had a seizure out of nowhere! I panicked immediately and screamed for someone to call 911. My husband is 6'1, 180 lbs. I am only 5'3', 123 lbs. Therefore, me trying to help him up and walk out of the bar was nearly impossible. Realizing this, I yelled frighteningly for one of the taller, bigger male employees to please help me stand up and walk my husband out of the building. Instead of rushing to help, they stood there and watched me struggle by myself. I asked them to get him water, I asked them for anything they could do as I was in such a fright, and they all watched nonchalantly as if we didn't matter. I was in such disbelief that these 3 white males watched this tiny black woman attempt to carry her muscular 180lb husband all alone with no sense of urgency. It was disgusting. I hated that. I hated them. Rude, inconsiderate, ridiculous behavior. How could you call yourself a man? If you want generous, caring service, refrain from RNR. Not to mention, show up at 7am or you'll never get a table.",

I recently came to RnR about 3 times in the last month after a hiatus from the bar scene and each time it just kept getting worse. The food is definitely not what it use to be, the drinks taste horrible, they don't have frozen margaritas, their award winning bloody Marys taste like sewer water and the service is non-existing!!! Management is also ridiculous, when we asked to talk to the GM he was so aggressive and definitely should not be managing a place... It's so bad that even our server was bad mouthing the manager Dakota to us... Also WTH happened to the staff they all look like trailer trash now. I also couldn't believe what I witnessed at the door literally some new dress code AKA racism(I've been coming here since this place opened and this dress code was never a thing)...

The dj was spinning pop electronica, but its not overbearingly loud. I ordered dirty chips. Definitely not worth the ten bucks - they're just two bags of potato chips covered in sour cream and mild-medium buffalo wing sauce, with some bacon and feta. There wasn't enough bacon or feta to make it worth ten bucks though. Do not order them  My beer was a Kilt Lifter, which got a 21 ibu, so its not too bitter, and tastes pretty good. More to come as my meal progresses  Edit: I finished the dirty chips, but only because I wanted to get my moneys worth - not because it was worth the money, which it wasn't. Luckily the ranch dressing that came with my burger was there tondip my dirtless (lacking toppings) remaining chips.   The parmesan fries were bland. I couldn't taste the parmesan, they just seemed like regular fries to me, nothing special.  The saving grace Could be the burger, but we shall see if this thirteen dollar burger can turn around an almost thirty dollar meal",

    "text": "It always nice to be one of the firsts to see a new restaurant, nightclub, bar, etc.  Especially because the service is typically great, everything is shiny & new.  And the enthusiasm of many familiar faces is felt from the moment you walk in.   RnR Scottsdale's opening night was no different than previously stated.    There was a much smaller food menu available, but they are Ready-N-Rolling (Rock-n-Roll, Rest-N-Relaxation, pick one or make up your own definition).  I had the new IPA by New Belgium (Fat Tire), Ranger.  Clean, smooth, not too hoppy.  The setting is comfortable and warm (heating on both upper and lower patios), TV's galore, great location on Scottsdale Road near RA and the Billet Bar.  There are a number of great names associated with this new endeavor and it shows.  They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for \"The Place\" to be.  Beginning this Saturday morning, they will roll out breakfast for the first time.  The menu, hours of operation and location make this a home-run in my book.  (had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area.)",

    "text": "RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.  The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.  The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.  There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.  I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.  I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out.",

    "text": "I hesitate to be critical of a place when it's only just opened. But I do this because I hope some of the problems can be fixed.  I'll start with the positive. The vibe of the place was great. I'm a huge fan of the building. The aesthetics of it are awesome. It feels small and intimate, but looking around, it can obviously accommodate a lot of people. From what I've seen, it's more geared towards large groups of people, with many large booths with room for 8.  There are a few problems that I'm sure every restaurant has when just starting out. The food took a very long while to come out. Which doesn't make sense, because not many people were ordering food. The most disappointing part was that the menu was limited to about 4 items. I went there on the third day they were open though, so all of this is completely forgivable.  There are a few things that I would expect to be more difficult to fix. Parking was a huge PITA. We parked about a half mile away, but I guess that's to be expected in Old Town. The location is right across from a biker bar. With a bunch of people coming and going from there with open pipes, it was difficult to have a conversation indoors next to a closed window. I imagine it was much worse for everyone on the patio. Above all, I don't think the quality of the food justified the price. I had the blue cheese burger, for $13. It was cooked to order nicely (med-rare), but had little flavor other then the toppings. The meat itself wasn't spectacular, which is what I would expect at that price. And the parmesan fries that came with were bland and came in a small portion.  There's a good amount of buzz about this place, and I think it shows promise. I definitely want to come back once they've settled in and give things another try.",

RnR is going to be the perfect spot for day drinking (due to their abundance of outdoor seating).  My favorite structural aspect of the decor was the wine wall - you can't miss it.  We didn't sample the menu items, just the cocktails.  The cocktails were great - an unusual selection of specialty cocktails. The menu has a a variety of selections without being overly pretentious.   I can't wait to visit again to see how RnR settles in.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great place frequent for lunch and for nights out.",

    "text": "Food- 2.5 Stars Service-.5 Stars  This place is great for that Saturday or Sunday morning cure for the hangover.  Their Sunday special for endless bloody mary and memosas is fantastic.  You used to be able to pay $10 for the bloodies and $15 for the memosas however now you have to purchase a breakfast ENTREE as well as the $10 or $15 for the drinks.  I think this is a bit steep, I know you are in Scottsdale but either discount the fee for the booze if you have to buy the breakfast or allow a customer to purchase breakfast entree and drink.  The bloody marys however are very cool...they put all the original fixings but then throw a piece of dried bacon in the center of the glass which is especially helpful if you are trying to cure that hangover we talked about earlier.  The ambience of the venue is cool very Scottsdale with limited amount of D-bags (except fo your servers which I'll cover in a moment).  Great place for happy hour or to catch a game and can generally find an area to hang out.  The reason I have not been back to RnR in a while is because the service is absolutely terrible.  I have gone at least 15 times and keep telling myself that next time the service will be better and that I'll try it again however I keep ending up disappointed.  Every time I have been (which is on Sunday for the endless booze) my waiter or waitress walks around pouting and unresponsive the entire time we are there.  I know you were probably out partying the night before and the last thing you want to do is be at work with people ordering booze and booze and breakfast, but if you hate your job so much quit.  I will probably give this place another try simply because their blood marys outweigh the terrible service, but if any MANAGEMENT is reading this they need to do a complete clean out of all their employees and start fresh or this place will eventually close.",

    "text": "I believe Old Town Scottsdale is already well-known for its wide selection of restaurants, so I imagine it's pretty tough to start a new one these days and set yourself apart.  In spite of that, RnR is doing a pretty good job of it so far.  My wife and I and six other friends had dinner and drinks here last night (a Saturday night).  Despite the place being full (not packed, but full), I thought we received friendly, attentive service throughout the night.  With that alone, you've basically won me over.  But, as I said, we have lots of choices in Old Town, so the food needs to be pretty good, too.  And it was!  My wife and I shared the ahi tacos to start.  They weren't your traditional ahi tacos - they were served on jicama tortillas - but that's okay.  The proportion was rather small, but they were delicious.  Moving on, I had the prime rib sandwich and my wife had the portobello mushroom sandwich.  Everything, including what I heard from our friends at the table, was excellent.  Actually, my sweet potato fries were soggy (not firm or crispy), but I'm going to write that off, because the flavor was still very good.  I'm sure if I had said anything to our waiter about it, he would've gladly done something.  I just didn't feel the need to.  There are also TVs everywhere, and music playing overhead.  I liked that combination, because I could keep up with the game on TV, but my wife didn't have to hear the announcer the entire time either.  Nice one, RnR.",

    "text": "We arrived at 10:30 and the place was nearly empty, but we were still told there would be a 45 min wait. Okay fine. Maybe they have reservations. We ended up finding some seating at the bar since we only had two in our party. First of all, as a bartender, I can say that the attitudes weren't bad per se. It just seemed like they couldn't be bothered to do their job. I get it. You work at the busiest place in the area for brunch. Poor you for making hundreds of dollars in a weekend. The least you can do is smile. We ordered bottomless mimosas, but were informed that the price depended on whether or not we also got food. The first two rounds of drinks were decent. After that, they started adding more orange juice. And as the place got busier, our drinks got weaker. We ordered food and sat around for a bit, chatting and catching up with each other as the place filled to capacity. When I finished my fourth mimosa, I noticed one of the bartenders filling one of the mimosa pitchers with something from the bar gun. I placed my hand over my glass and asked what exactly was being added to the simplest of drinks. Soda water. Half he pitcher was soda water. A quarter was orange juice and the last quarter was champagne. So if you're looking to sip some bubbly and get a nice buzz on a Sunday, I'd say this isn't the place. Just okay food doesn't make up for the watered down drinks, apathetic attitudes and longer than necessary wait times. I predict this place won't last long.",
