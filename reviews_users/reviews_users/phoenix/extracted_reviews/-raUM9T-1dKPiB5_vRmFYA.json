Hey, I could have gone to Capital Grill for not that much more.   Beef was somewhat bland today. Fries were awesome as usual, forgot to ask them to make them extra crispy...but they are good.

Not that the hot dogs aren't enjoyable because they absolutely are...heck, I eat them all the time! I'm just saying that I've had other Vienna Beef hot dogs that tasted a bit better. Maybe they're boiled instead of grilled? Overall though, you can't go wrong. I'm a big fan! Keep up the good work and I will keep coming back!",

I ordered a sausage and peppers to go with cheese and a large side of fries (\"more than enough he said for 2 to share). The sausage, while tasty enough, was pretty dry. Then crusty white bread had too many REALLY REALLY mushy parts. Basically half of it fell apart like my Aunt Helen did when I told her I was a mo. The crinkle fries were awesome. Crinkly and crunchy. Though not the enormous portion I anticiapted.  The large fries were $3.75 and the sandwich was $5.50.   Service was spot on. Friendly and fast. I'll visit again, though I'll be sure to try a Chicago dog or Bratwurst!",

No good reason I don't go regularly - the food is always exactly what I expect and the prices are fair. I seem to stick with the Italian beef - but the menu also covers hot dogs, hamburgers, subs and Italian Sausage. (I will have to try sausage, peppers and onions with red sauce at some point - one of my ultimate comfort foods- to see if they're as good as Guido's in Scottsdale.) The beef is juicy, shaved thin - and works perfectly with the giardinera and hoagie roll.   For those nights when I just need a mouthful of hot meat, Luke is my go-to guy! So happy I can satiate the craving right around the corner from home!",

Since we are Health Care Professionals and deal with the public we just ignored them ate our food had a great time and smiled at them on the way out. Go to Portillo's stay away from here not really worth it except you may want to get the red sauce for your sandwiches at Portillo's that's about it. 1 star for the red sauce that's all.",

Since moving to Phoenix, we can't find a good one.  This one came very close, but the owners attitude sucks.  Furthermore, the guy charges 70 cents per topping which puts the normal toppings at 2.80 on top of the 8 dollars and change for the sandwich.  23 bucks for 2 of them.  This guy is crazy for charging such a price.  He definitely lost some business from us, especially considering we used to go 1-2 times a week at the last place.    The nail in the coffin was when my buddy said good bye on the way out and he just looked at us.  Unbelievable that you treat your patrons like that!  I'd rather give my business to someone else.",

The outside is a bit weathered with a very small eating area inside.  Been coming here on and off since I moved out here. The menu has the typical Chicago favorites with the service and attitude that make you feel right at home. Giggles!   Usually order one of the famous Chi-Dogs or maybe an Italian Beef with both sweet and hot peppers. The french fries here are your typical frozen crinkle cut kind and nothing special. Wish they had handcut. They are so much tastier and can be found in other Chi-town hole in the wall places around town.  There are so many new Chicago restaurants in the PHX area now and some of them big chains. Luke's has lost their edge over the years. The quality of the food and the service is not as good as it was in the past and the prices keep going up. Maybe I'm just getting spoiled in my old age.  Everyone has a different opinion of this place and the only way to find out is to give them a try. The parking lot is somewhat limited and a bit tricky at times. This place can definitely get really busy during peak eating hours. So get ready for a bunch of impatiant hungry people. ORDER UP!  3 STARS",

I know there are a couple of places that make you pay extra for sweet peppers and giardiniera, so this didn't upset me too much, but the attitude of the cashier did and the fact that I paid the extra and did not get them did.  I got my food to go so I didn't realize the missing peppers until I got home. Also, it was the driest Italian beef I have ever eaten.  With other places nearby that you can get a really good Italian Beef sandwich, that cost a lot less, I'm not sure why this place always seems to be busy.      Now in their defense, I never complained about the mistake, so they never got the chance to fix it..  Also, maybe the cashier was having a bad day, it happens.  The overall experience has kept me from going back. Other friends have told me they don't like their Italian Beef, but that they do have good dogs.",

Older lady who took my order seemed a little frazzled wasn't familiar with garlic parmesean fries and I was repeating everything.    I asked about why phone kept ringing when I tried to call in order. Her response was boss was had to talk to wife for half hour then she had to make some phone calls as well. Food did come out quick and as always italian beef is great. I think next time Ill order dry and sauce on the side. The peppers are not hot. The fries were overcooked and next time Ill order regular fries. It was just garlic powder and dry parmesean. Was expecting fresh garlic and parmesean crumble that you can taste not what you get when you order take out pizza.   JR size italian beef is more than enough for me Decent price close enough to work but there is another spot on the Arcadia side that is closer to home better service better hot peppers and even better price so now im going to change my rating to three stars.",

    "text": "This my friends, is the long time home of the Best Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich in Phoenix !   What in the dickens makes a good Italian Beef Sandwich? Well, it depends on who you ask to a certain extent.   My unbiased opinion of what makes this the perfect sandwich, starts with in house, slow cooked, thinly sliced, Beef, with a blend of Italian spices and it's own natural juices. You add that to the perfect type of roll that is dipped in those juices, a slice of provolone cheese is added to the steaming beef and roll, then top it off with house made giardinara, made of Zucchini, Olives, Serrano Chilies, Carrots, and Olive Oil, and boom....There you have it! Top it off, by pouring a cup of the beef stock over the sandwich before you put your bib on and create a dam of napkins on the table for the inevitable mess that the authentic sandwich is going to create. ;)   Note to those who get all hurt and flustered about the house made giardanara because they use Serrano chilies, they do offer the pickled giardanara as an alternative option as well. So don't shoot them down before you go and give the place a shot.   The fries are crispy on the outside and like a mashed potato on the inside.   The Polish, and Brat are real sausage links from their own supplier, not the crappy hotdog like sausages that you get from a hotdog stand on the street of a crappy neighborhood or from a place like Lobby's in Tempe.   The only thing that sometimes throws off the consistent experience for me, is that at times when I ask for a side of the beef stock, it isn't stirred before they dish it up, and it has a thick layer of oil in the cup, rather than the aqueous layer beneath which contains all of the flavor. This is something that they could take as a constructive criticism at times.  The only other establishment that serves up a perfected version of this beef sandwich is the owners brother who just opened up Chicago's Taylor Street. He was the best maker of theses sandwiches at Lukes for years, and recently opened up his own spot. It's great to see some competition in this Valley, especially with a couple of brothers competing with eachother. It should help keep the standards high, which should create a good product for us.  Try out both of these spots and write an according review to spark up the competition to the two current greats in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers! :)",

We ordered two kids chicken tender meals for $8.80 each and they didn't come with a drink when he said they did. I asked for bbq sauce for the tenders and the only thing they had was ranch. I'm from Chicago and this place is a joke and shouldn't display a city that has some of the best food around. Very insulting",

The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because of the peppers, and giardinieri.  The meat was excellent, as was the bun.  If I was rating the sandwich strictly based on that I would have give it 5 stars.  The au jus was fantastic as well.  And they dipped it perfectly.  It was soggy like it should be, but I could still pick it up and eat it.  The only issue I had was the peppers and giardinieri.  I get mine with both hot and sweet peppers.  The giardiniera lacked something.  For one thing there was not enough of it on the sandwich so it was missing that spicy kick.  The sweet peppers were not cut up, so it was just one big roasted red and green pepper.  Slicing it up smaller helps when eating the sandwich.  The only other issue I had was the price.  After adding both peppers, small fries, and a small coke, my bill came to $12.40.  That's about 4-5 dollars more than I pay for the same thing at other places.",

He said he knew a spot, so we ended up at the Scottsdale Luke's, and it was so good that I had my parents meet me at the Indian School location a week later to try that one out.  Both times I had an Italian beef with cheese, no peppers, and a side of fries with cheese, and an RC Cola to wash it all down. The problem with most Italian beef sandwiches I've had out here is the beef itself...usually it's chewy or just sub-par, but Luke's gets it right. The beef is tender, juicy, and just right. The sandwiches come dipped (wet), so it's a sloppy ordeal but that's how it's supposed to be. If you don't want to get a little messy with your dinner, then ask for it \"dry\".   I'll definitely be back, but I'm gonna have to limit my visits as this ain't exactly healthy eats...however, I'm ok with that for food that tastes this good.",

    "text": "Their Italian Beef is made in house and in my opinion is way, way better than Portillo's. The bread is pretty good as well. It holds up under the juice.  They have tasty sweet peppers and a very flavorful yet not too hot giardiniera.  Their Italian Sausage is tasty as well.  I usually get a beef or combo dipped with sweet and a side of hot as well as extra juice with a side of well done fries.   Let the beef drip on the fires and poor more juice on the fries. Put half the hot on the sandwich and the rest on the fries.  Then any beef pieces that fall off on the fries and have some beefy hot juicy fries.   The polish are good as well.   Not a fan of the dogs but that's because I'm a natural casing kind of guy. If you are ok with a no casing Vienna beef dog then you will be ok with the dogs.  They also have your standard Chicago tamale and pizza puffs.  I would eat there a few times a week if I lived closer.   This is a real Chicago beef and it's not packed in Chicago and shipped frozen to Phoenix.   You can tell it's real and homemade because sometimes it's OK, much of the time it's pretty good and other times it's fantastic.  My favorite beef is Al's on Taylor if you need a baseline for my tastebuds.   In Chicago Portillo's wouldn't even be on my list. There are far too many neighborhood beef stands to go to Portillo's in Chicago.   In Phoenix Lukes is by far my first choice. And it's family owned and operated.",

I've been going here for almost 20 years (geez, I'm getting old!) and it's always great quality, piping hot and spicy hot if you get it with the hot pepper mix --which is uniformly HOT.  I love this stuff.  Jalapenos, celery and other veggies pickled into atomic flavor bombs.  If you don't like hot jalapenos, you may want to pick another topping option.  The beef is always tender and I've never had a gristly or fatty piece.  The bread is good stuff--they get it from a local bakery and it's perfect.  The fries are crinkly cut and yummy --if they cook them long enough (hate it when the fries aren't crisp --and these can be soggy if they pull them out of the fryer too soon).  They have diet RC on tap and unlike other places, they have a good syrup to soda proportion instead of cheaping out so it tastes like soda should--not just like fizzy Phoenix tap water.  The sandwiches might seem a little pricey compared to other places, but they're totally worth it --and if you read my other reviews, you know that I have a very sensitive price to value ratio, so that's high praise coming from me.",

    "text": "I went to Luke's for the first time last evening, and I am kicking myself for not having gone sooner.  Just a couple of blocks from my house, I must have driven by this gem a thousand of times in the last four years, OHH!.  During my short wait, I really got the Chicago thing, just standing there soaking in all of the memorabilia, a photo of a young handsome Ditka with perfect hair, the city skyline, actual metal municipal signage, White Sox this, Cubbies that.  They really  hit the mark here, and I don't even like Chicago (Go Orioles!).  When it is your turn to order, you better spit it out, no hemming and haawing, this is like a real city in here, time is a premium, and the people behind you in line and the guy taking your order won't appreciate that drawn out, indecisive manner that is so prevalent in Phoenix and Denver.  I ordered an Italian Beef sandwich plain, this was the acid test, kind of like ordering fish and chips in an English or Irish pub.  I also ordered a Beef and sausage Combo with hot peppers and provolone.  A large order of fries and two sides of  complimentary \"gravy' to go with the sandwiches. The gravy is actually an au jus, and it is so delicious.  I recommend getting it in a container, and not poured all over the sandwich, especially if it is a to-go order.  The hot peppers are pretty hot, I think they were raw jalepenos, so no need to elaborate.  The plain beef sandwich was such a pleasant surprise, the bread was fresh and soft, the meat was juicy, flavorful and plentiful.  It is good all by itself and even better when dipped in the gravy.  The Combo beef and sausage with cheese and hot peppers was also fantastic.  I love Italian sausage and though this was not the absolute best I've ever tasted, I really appreciated that it did not have an overpowering fennel seed flavor.  The fries are fat crinkle cut and they were served very hot, crispy, and light golden in color.  Fries can be such a disappointment if undercooked, so if you like them well done and browner than gold, you might want to pass.  I love Luke's, and i hope they will be in my neighborhood for a very long time.",

With that said, I ordered the Italian Beef Sandwich with sweet peppers, onion rings, and a fountain drink. Total price for the meal was over $14. In my opinion the meal was pretty pricey. As for taste, the Italian was good. Not amazing, lacked a little seasoning that I love with Italian Beef, but it was good. The real winner were the onion rings. They had a great crunch and flavor and would recommend. Overall, a decent spot but still in search of amazing Italian Beef.",

And despite that, I love this place. Thankfully I have enough self-control to avoid going more than a couple times a year, which was greatly aided by my move from a downtown firm to Scottsdale. A bunch of my coworkers, all male of course, would get cravings for this joint and despite our better judgment head down and scarf down our fill of the most delicious, greasy Chicago-style hot dogs and sausages you can imagine. One of my friends was from Chicago and he has certified its Chicagoness.   A female friend once wanted to join us, as we were headed out one day. She asked if they served salads. We must have laughed for ten minutes straight.   If you're allergic to the Chicago Cubs, stay far away. The decor will kill you, assuming your choked arteries from eating here don't first.  EDIT: In case I didn't make it clear, and without getting Lukes into trouble with the EEOC or something... I really can't imagine a girl coming here and actually liking it. Any girl who does would probably scare me, a lot. So, while I'm sorry that Patti B's experience here was \"awful\" (lol!), that pretty much confirms that Patti is in fact a normal gal.",

I would be lying if I didn't tell you that this is my favorite hot dog in town and occasionally crave it.  The area is scary so you may want to exercise your second amendment right when you come here.  Also parking blows since there is always more people that want to go here at lunch than spots to park.

The guys here were saying pop instead of soda so I guess I can call it authentic... I ordered the Italian beef with cheese and onion rings. The Italian beef had very very little cheese but had a kick to it. It was juicy so it was hard to eat. The onion rings were fresh and crispy. My friend got the cheese fries which were better than what I ordered and I'm not even a nacho cheese fan. I'll try it again but next time I'm grabbing a bratwurst with fries. They have a pizza puff that sounds interesting as well. Give it a shot.",

    "text": "I always love some good Chicago style food! I've been driving by this place for over a year and finally decided to stop in for lunch. I got my usual for my first time to a new Chicago style restaurant - the classic Chicago style dog. I also got cheese fries because well, they're cheese fries!   Overall, this place was just okay. And if I've learned anything, just okay is not okay. But I'll still give them 3 stars.   The Chicago dog itself was nothing over the top, just what would be expected. The fries were undercooked and over-salted. I expect crispy salted just the right amount fries and these fries made my stomach a bit upset. The cheese helped cover the taste of the extra salt.   The atmosphere was cool - Chicago street signs and sports memorabilia decor. I was surprised the TV was turned off though. The bathrooms weren't exactly acceptable and they have a funky smell. They also require a code due to the neighborhood the Luke's is in.   All of that would have still been 4 stars. Unfortunately, the service did not meet my expectations. I get that every food worker in Phoenix hates their job (don't know why, you make a higher wage and get paid sick time now.. you're welcome?) but I was hoping for that Midwest hospitality that you would get when you are actually in Chicago. The cashier who took my order couldn't have been more monotone and lethargic. I felt that \"I just work here\" attitude. It's unfortunate because this place would be great if they just had better service.    It was okay food but I won't be coming back. Glad I at least tried it.",

My husband needed a quick lunch and I suggested this since he was in the area. He is a total brat/hot dog fan and was excited for his visit  So disappointed! He was served the absolute worst brat by restaurant standards...ever! The brat was basically burnt. Reminded me of drunken backyard BBQ's where food didn't matter and you ate it so you wouldn't have a hangover. Not sure if it was yesterday's reheated or the gentleman trying to cook and serve was overwhelmed.  Sorry but this is probably my last time here!",

If that's what ur into then you'll love it.  But where it's REALLY at is the Italian sausage sandwich!!!!   Omg this thing is like something you would get at a street fair.  It's charred and crispy on the outside and spicy and succulent but n the inside.  Served plain is perfect, it's juicy enough on its own.  The cheese fries are excellent, cheesy and crunchy.  I also tried the Hot Tamale which was good but like microwaveable.  I think it's just a nostalgic Chicago thing.  Try Lukes but if u don't order the Italian sausage sandwich u will be sorry!!!!",

It has about 10-12 four-person tables in the shop.  Small menu but you really don't need a lot.  I ordered the Italian Beef (Dry) with the juice on the side.  Fries.  Fountain drink.  They have 'Hires Root Beer' in the machine.  Haven't had that brand in quite some time.  All the food was hot and tasty.  I dipped the sandwich and the juice is a bit spicy but it could be just me as I'm not a 'spicy' or 'hot' kind of guy.  But it was good.  The beef was lean...no fat; and that's a BIG plus for me.  Crinkle fries.  Friendly guy at the counter who kept bantering with customers at the other tables while taking orders so the process of getting your order in and paying was about twice as long but not a big deal.  Overall, being from Northwest Indiana originally, the food was good but still not the taste of my youth that I'm looking for.  I'd probably go back but only if in the area.",

I have not heard anything at all about Luke's from my Chicago friends which I thought was strange.  I decided to try Luke's because it was fairly close to my house and every time I drive by I always saw a nice amount of cars outside of the establishment.   I looked over the limited menu and decided on an Italian Beef Sandwich which was thinly sliced roast beef on what should have been a crisp baguette with roasted bell peppers, giardiniera hot peppers and provolone cheese. The flavor was A-OK, nothing to brag about.  The bread was SUPER soggy, wet soggy, unenjoyable soggy.  The meat was salty. I had to eat my sandwich with a fork because the bread was literally mush.  It old my friends that are Chicago natives about my experience and they said you should have told them not to dip it too long or too much.  Who knew? Because of this I won't try the Italian Beef sandwich again.  That was enough! I would like to try the Italian Sausage because I love Italian Sausages from just about everywhere.",

Please for the love of God go to Portillos if you want an excellent beef or hot dog or even a nice attitude from nice employees. Btw I've eaten at Luke's today for the last time. They couldn't even get a 2 hot dog order correct....took 3 times and still was wrong after waiting 30 min. Girl at the counter was clueless and the staff in the back was too lazy to come up and help. 1 star. #gosomewhereelse",

    "text": "DOWNHILL.  I've been eating at Luke's a few times a month since 1996.  Over the last few years, It's slowly been going downhill.  Their signature Italian Beef sandwiches are often served barely warm or cold.  The extremely hard crusted french bread used to be dipped in au ju (gravy) to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor.  Now, no matter how you order it (extra gravy, wet, etc.) the sandwich comes out almost completely dry and is guaranteed to destroy the roof of your mouth.  I'm really disappointed to see a restaurant I've had so many good lunches wither away, but even their health inspections have made dining here risky at best.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.maricopa.gov%2Fenvsvc%2Fenvwebapp%2Ftabs%2Fresults.aspx%3FnavigatedFrom%3DbusinessResultsDrillDown%26mc_perm_id%3D11712%26business%3DLUKE%27S%2520RESTAURANT%26address%3D1602%2520%2520%2520E%2520%2520INDIAN%2520SCHOOL%2520RD%26permitid%3DSG13198&s=163a63f08e36b5bbb1c4de31f22ee61a3565cf9d165f95af35f3b1de5d5d2af6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">maricopa.gov/envsvc/envw...</a>  All this and their prices have been skyrocketing!

It's not great, it's not amazing, it's not orgasmic, but it's good.  Ok, so probably somewhere in between good and very good.    The beef here is about as close to Chicago style as you're going to get; thinly sliced, properly seasoned with some nice sweet peppers.  The bread is a little different than I'm used to, most Chicago places serve their beefs on an 8'' roll that is close to a bratwurst roll.  Luke's serves theirs on about a foot long thing that resembles french bread.    The sandwich is authentically messy and drippy.  Please don't expect to eat this daintily.  It does not happen.  Roll up your sleeves and bring extra napkins.    I'll be back when I need a fix and don't mind eating an entire day's worth of calories in one sitting.",

I moved here from Chicago about 4 years ago and although I haven't been on a mad hunt the whole time, I have had some disappointing beefs.  Luke's is by far the best I've had.    I think the best value is to buy a pound of beef and peppers from Luke's and cook it at home.  You have to buy your own bread, I like sub rolls.  The preparation is easy; just simmer in a pot on real low heat.  Then you can make em as juicy and messy, or dry as you like.  I find buying a pound will feed 3-4 and it's cheaper.  I haven't had anything else there.",

    "text": "FOOD: During a lunch break in between classes one day, my buddy insist he drive me over to 16th St and Indian School (from ASU) for an Italian Beef sandwich. I must say, the drive was worth it. Luke's Italian Beef sandwich is so oddly delicious, you'll forget that it's probably a leading cause of heart attacks in the area. The sandwich looks plain and messy, but bite into it and you will know what I'm talking about. I haven't had many Italian beef sandwiches in my days, but Luke's has brought the food some considerable respect from me.   PRICE: Good prices, great place to get take out or when you're on the move. You can spend less than $10 for sure.   ATMOSPHERE: Let's just say don't bring a date here. Great place to eat with a friend or two. But the dining area is limited, fits maybe 20 people.   SERVICE: The guys are friendly even though they come off as tough guys. Just don't make any Chicago Cubs jokes and you'll be fine.   SKINNY: If I lived closer, I would go to Luke's much more often. It's a delicious, fast place to grab some food without lowering yourself to crappier fast foods. The food makes me feel so full and bloated, but that's a good thing.",

Put the peppers on them if you know how to eat one right.   The place is as Chicago as it gets. If you order a hot dog with everything on it, they don't include ketchup unless you specifically ask. Their supplier is Vienna Beef, and they even have the neon green relish. The fries are even the exact the same as the Chicago locations.   The place is also very Chicago themed. Pictures and posters of the Windy City and its sports teams surround you. And if stop by during a Cubs game, rest assured it will be playing on the TV.   The prices are the one big negative that keeps me from driving over to Luke's more often. Although the food tastes great, and is worth the value for an occasional trip, it's a lot of money for greasy fast food.  But if you're looking for an authentic Chicago hot dog or Italian Beef in Phoenix, hit up Luke's.",

Luke's can't hold a candle to Delux or the Sonora Brewery, but they are definitely cheaper, likely closer and they've a down-home feel.  The customer service was fantastic and incredibly friendly.

Any hack who has had one can emulate the Chicago Hot Dog, but it takes a special touch to get the Italian Beef sammich just right. Luke's does.    Don't take a date there. Don't expect comfy seating and a cozy atmosphere. You may wait a long time in line. You may wait a long time for your food. You may ingest 2300 calories in a single sitting.

The beef was greasy , the giardinara was sliced up jalapenos and onions with oil thrown on them I almost puked. Their fries are frozen store bought. If you want a decent beef you're better off going to Portillos. What a waste of time and money.  Whoever taught the 400 pound fit in the back how to make beefs needs to be shot. Totally disappointed! !!!",

I can't believe I'm saying this but their Italian Beef is better than the Chicago Hamburger Company, and if you are a west sider, then I'll tell you it is better than Fuzzy's of Chicago also.    That is a seriously strong statement and I am shaking my head in disbelief while writing it, just like I was shaking my head in disbelief while eating it.  Did I say holy crap!?  HOLY CRAP its good.  The beef is wonderfully tender and juicy.  So juicy in fact they don't even serve it with au jus, but they do have it on hand if requested.  I recommend you ask for a side.  Save some for me though!  My only very minor statement is that I like the hot pepper mix at my other two spots better, but the beef...  OH the BEEF makes up for this tiny shortcoming.  I can't wait to go back.... and back... and back.",

The bread maybe wasn't cut quite enough, so I got that kind of sandwich where half the bites are just bread - but it was cooked pretty well, and was dripping with meat juice.  The fries were ok - never been a huge fan of the thick crinkle-cut fries, but they were cooked right. The RC in the fountain was something different, so that's always nice.",

I decided to make the trip into town on two different occasions this past month for Italian beef, and their quality and freshness became so much better late in the afternoon. I was so sorry I took out early on my second trip to get there for opening at 11am for an early lunch. It was only then that I realized that all of the leftover slow-cooked beef had to be reheated in order to be used up first; this also included a heavy dose of salt!  Their Italian Beef becomes dry and tasteless from their morning prep method compared with their fresh product later in the day, high in sodium.  I would not trust this company for its catering service or buy their Italian beef by the pound for these very reasons.",

The wife and go through periods where we drive down there from the west valley every weekend. My wife and several of our friends are from Chicago and they'd put this place right up there with the best in Chicago. This place beats Portillo's hands down, nice local spot instead of the big chain feel you get from Portillo's. I probably should give it a bad review to keep it from becoming over crowded. LOL.",

I work nearby and used to recommend this place to new employees and students on rotations at my job site. The food has remained pretty consistent over the years but the customer service has fallen way below satisfactory. There are a couple of employees that seem pleased to help you as you place your order but the older man who has been there lately is just not friendly. I have tolerated it lately as I've enjoyed the food over the years but today was the last day I'll go back.  He is rude, unwelcoming and does not understand basic customer service.  Today, after standing in line with six others, he took the orders of the five individuals in front of me. As soon as he took that fifth order he walked around from behind the counter as if I wasn't even there in plain view, walked past me and proceeded to pick up trash off the floor, wipe some tables down, then walked past me once again, never acknowledging me, to grab the trash bin and baskets. As he approaches the counter once again, I ask if he is going to take my order and he says, \"do you not see I'm doing something?\"  I ask again what he said in case I heard him incorrectly and he repeats himself asking if I did not see him doing something then proceeds to tell me I am rude. I say you clearly don't want my business and I left.  This is no way to treat a loyal customer of five years with many referrals to your business. Very unfortunate.",

Well today after being sick for the past week and on a strict liquid diet i finally got my appetite back and wanted something but wasn't sure what i wanted. After searching the web for restaurants near me Luke's popped up and boy am i glad it did. I took the 5 minute drive and as soon as i walked into the place i knew that this wasn't just a restaurant this was a joint.. a True chicago joint. As soon as you cross the threshold you're no longer in Phoenix you're in Chicago. The owner Cary is a very friendly guy and we chatted for a good bit about back home. This joint really brought me back to my childhood when i would frequent my neighborhood not to mention the food which was amazing.. just like back home. Luke's also features Jays potato chips and Green River & RC pop. If you're a Chicagoan or someone that always wondered what Chicago food is all about i highly recommend Luke's of Chicago. I honestly cannot wait until my next visit. Keep up the great work Luke's!!",

I as a customer have bad attitude too some times. Not every day I am all smiles and high spirits. My cousin owned restaurants in this town and I have periodically worked there. Maybe is me, but I don't go to Luke's for their cleaned toilet, I have that in my office. I go there for their great food. I don't worry that the area is not great. I called south Phoenix home for many years. It is nothing wrong with 16th street and Indian School. There are better restaurants in worse areas of this town. Luke's  roast beef with all the extras is the best I ever had. Support the little guy, the local restaurant. Yes, the big boys can build bigger and better places, but personally I don't go to a place for the decorations on the wall. I go there for their food. And I review based on how good their food is.",

For me, that was too wet and messy; I would prefer the sauce on the side.  The owner's son attended us at the counter and was pleasure to meet. He was incredibly enthusiastic about the restaurant (even though he said he had been working there since he turned 12) and equally knowledgeable about the product, recommending a number of substitutions and configurations.  Basically, my food was an exalted, gourmet version of Costco's polish dog and I loved it. I'm looking forward to trying the beef sandwich next time.",

    "text": "There is no doubt about it, Luke's on Indian School does Chicago-style beefs very accurately. In Chicago, good little dives like this are everywhere, but out in Phoenix, the few that try to delivery the same flavors of the windy city usually fall short.   I can only speak for the Italian beef for now, but it was great! I walked up to the counter, and without hesitation, said, \"Beef, dry, with extra giardiniera and au jus on the side.\" Needless to say, the guy behind the counter and I had a moment; he understood me and didn't need to follow up with any questions. When the food came out (it took a little longer than expected, but the cook kindly apologized fot the wait) my taste buds got excited. It was loaded with giardiniera! I've found that a lot of places are stingy with that delicious condiment, but not here. I asked for extra, and by golly, I got extra. One unique thing about the giardiniera was that it seemed fresh, like really fresh, and there were jalapenos in it! Yes! This little touch took that beef over the top. I put that sammich down and didn't leave a trace.  Luke's has won me over for when I'm craving some delicious guilt-full Chicago staples. It's not as good as a plane ticket back home to dine, but it's not bad at all.  PRO TIP: I understand the complaint with soggy sandwiches, so if you don't want it like that (dipped), ask for it dry, and ask for any peppers on the side. That should help keep your sandwich intact.",

    "text": "Had the beef sandwich, hot tamale and chili cheese fries.  The beef sandwich was dripping in au jus and was really good.  It was my first time eating a hot tamale...meh.  Chili cheese fries...how can you screw those up right?  So yes this is a good spot.  Would definitely return if I lived in Phoenix.  The two guys behind the counter were a little less than friendly, but it was late in the evening and so I'll give them a pass",

    "text": "My poor Arizonian babies...  I'm not sure if Luke is from Chicago or not, but this is not Chicago styled food.    I just moved to Phoenix from the Windy City in January and I had a hankering for an Italian Beef sandwich.  I started to try out Rosati's which is closer to where I live, but decided I'd yelp first to see what options I had.  Luke's was one of the more popular recommendations.  I stopped by this evening and there was a group of ladies in front of me.  I took a moment to look at the menu, but I already knew what I wanted- mostly just filling the time until the guy at the counter was ready to take my order.  As the girls took to their seats, I was expecting the guy to greet me or ask me what I was having. Not everyone's big on small talk.  I get it.  Welp, the guy walked past me and avoided eye contact, heading into the back.  I waited at the counter, and he came back out within seconds... And walked right past me again.  He was apparently getting some cups for the ladies who were in line before me.  A simple \"I'll be with you in a minute\" would do.  None offered.  So I finally place my order and give the guy my credit card.  He swipes it and sits it on the counter and walks into the back again.  I wasn't sure if he'd actually collected the payment or what, so I left it there.  He comes back out and is shuffling around a bit, finally noticing that my card is still on the counter, then asks me if it's mine.  Then he remembers that I still need to sign off on the receipt.  I get my food, and leave.  Bad service, I'm hoping the food at least makes up for it.    When I get home, I can't wait to dig into my Italian Beef.  Oh boy!  It was dry and the beef tasted like it had been re-cooked.  People, I'm from Chicago.  You can get this quality of Italian Beef from any hole-in-the-wall place in the city.  Thing is, it'll be about $4.  If you want a better quality sandwich, you'll probably go to an Al's beef location and spend about $6.  For $7.20 here, this place is ripping you off.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give 1 star, but the beef was good. Got 2 Italian roast beef sandwiches and fries.  LOUSY service, mediocre proportions vs others around, no fresh cut fries! Hardly any giardiniera. Come on. Fresh cut fries are sooo much better and cheaper for the store.   Rude fat bastard working the counter. Even my mom couldn't believe how rude he was. He acted like it was the worst day of his life and he wanted to burn the place down or something.  Almost every other place I have tried has more meat and no probs with customer service. Rosati's was better. Joey's was better. Chicago hamburger company was better. Defalcos was better. Philadelphia sandwich company was better, kinda. PSC is kinda hit and miss.  Luke's was good a long time ago. With so many other places serving basically the same thing, you have to set yourself apart from other places. Luke's does, but in a bad way. And if you've ever had a sandwich in Chicago, DOESN\"T EVEN COMPARE! Twice if not 3x more meat.  AND I ASKED FOR IT DIPPED! THEY DIDN'T!",
