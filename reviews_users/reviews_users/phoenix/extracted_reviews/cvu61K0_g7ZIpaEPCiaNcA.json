We ordered the #38 chapchae, #47 beef bulgogi dukbaegi (my personal favorite), #68 soon-tofu and #70 galbi-tang.   The servers were all very attentive and checked in on us often to see if we needed anything.  At the end of the meal we were served a sweet cold drink which was just the perfect way to cap off a wonderful meal.  Will definitely come back and often.",

As far as the food goes, nothing was amazing, but nothing was horrible either. We did not try the BBQ, and might consider going back to try that sometime. We did try the Yuk-Gae-Jang and the Dragon Roll, Hawaiian Roll, Wildfire Roll, and California Tempura. We felt that everything was a little overpriced and we know better sushi spots with cheaper prices.",

I am so glad I chose this place. The food had so much quality and authenticity . The meat was awesome, which honestly, is hard to find around the Phoenix area. Also, the sides were so delicious. Customer service was way over the top. Our server Johnathan was so personable, he had me and my boyfriend laughing none stop. AND!! to top it off, the owners are from the Chicago. There was an instant connection. Me loving Korean BBQ and my boyfriend being from Chicago and now his new found love for Korean BBQ. This place is definitely on the top of my list to return to. TRUST ME. Thank you Albert for all the tips and advice from food to travel and beyond. I will definitely be back here, thinking about going for a team night with my co workers. That's how much I would like to rave about this place!",

Food: Pretty pricey. My fiance's grandpa got the beef bibimbap and my fiance and I shared the beef bulgogi--good portion and the right amount of tender, but for the price, other places are comparable in taste for cheaper.  Atmosphere: tons of seating and looked like there was even a private room you can rent out. Clean/spacious overall.  Service: this was the downfall for me. While the servers were very friendly, I went here with my fiance's grandpa and uncle who have never had Korean bbq and inevitably had questions. The servers unfortunately couldn't answer any of the questions we had about the menu.   Between the price and the service, in the future I'd go elsewhere to get my Korean bbq fix.",

We're from Los Angeles and have tried the most popular Korean BBQ restaurants in LA but this place is by far the BEST! We loved their friendly service, the ambience and most importantly, their food. The 16 side dishes alone can satisfy your palate. Such a feast and fine dining experience we had at Seoul BBQ and Sushi. My wife and daughter enjoyed their fresh sashimi and sushi rolls (especially rainbow rolls) while my son and I savored mouthwatering Galbi, grilled beef brisket, Naengmyeon, and many more. We loved their deep fried dumpling and chicken wings as appetizers.  While staying in AZ, we've gone back several times because of our great dining experience. Try their spicy Chilean sea bass soup and the stuffed boiled Cornish hen with ginseng and vegetables soup. Wow! We wish they can open a restaurant in LA, too.",

Surprisingly, the sushi is also exceptional and something you don't always see in Korean BBQ establishments.  I would say the sushi alone is on par with high end sushi restaurants.  The restaurant itself looks brand new with many private rooms or open seating.  Nice bar and sushi bar sections as well so there seemed to be many options depending on your party.  Great service and the owner often stopped by to check on you and was very friendly and accommodating.  Interestingly, I saw they had photos of many of the LPGA Korean golfers frequent the establishment when in town for the the LPGA tournament in March which wasn't surprising.  Highly recommend.",

We frequent Pappadeaux's often and this was the first time we noticed. There weren't many cars there, and we drove around looking to make sure it was even open. We decided to double back and give it a try. From the front door, the hostess was so incredibly nice and sincere with her welcome. As we were lead to our table, we noticed that it had a hot place in the middle. My wife got excited. We sat down and were handed two massive menus. There was many different choices. I love Korean BBQ, Japanese and Asian quinine alike, and my wife is also fan and loves her sushi. This place had it all. I ordered tempura shrimp, and the BBQ Beef lunch special. It came with soup, steamed rice and 8 (yeah, I thought it was a typo... It wasn't) side dishes. My wife opted for some sushi and the teriyaki chicken.   The service was impeccable. The wait staff was h very friendly, and helpful. Our food came out in a flash, you hear me. We blinked and they were bringing it out. It was piping hot, and sizzling as they sat it down. One bite of my BBQ Beef and I got teary eyed. It had the nerve to be everything I expected with a little smoked flavor as if it was grilled over wood. It was well seasoned and AMAZING. I reached across the table and snatch some chicken. Bam! Amazing as well. Out of the 8 sides we loved the radish and cabbage kimchi, the caramelized potato, the fish cake (and I don't eat fish, and had eaten it all before asking what it was and was surprised... It was delicious)... I took pictures of what was left of our food, and sent out texts to my friends. I ordered a second order of the teriyaki chicken for lunch tomorrow, and I'm posting a review here. This is a great place for a girl's night, a date night, or an affordable lunch. We loved it and will be back soon!",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Foghat - Slow Ride)  Seoul bites, right in Phoenix Seoul bites, right in Phoenix Seoul bites, right in Phoenix Seoul bites, right in Phoenix  I'm in the mood The Japchae is right Move to the Galbi We can eat it all night  I was pretty skeptical of this place when I first saw it.  It was in an area close to a lot of chain restaurants so that was a downer for me.  As I arrived to the place I was somewhat put at ease.  The place was fresh and chilly as in most Korean BBQ places.  It had a beautiful bar plus the place was clean and a modern Asian theme to it.  Moreover, I rather appreciate SeoulPHX since they had a combo selection based on the size of your group.  We ordered the 5 people combo which came with onion pancakes, salad, and tofu soup.  The onion pancakes was bland and lacked textured, but the sauce that came along helped give it some pop; pungent, sweet and spicy all at once.  The tofu soup was okay at best based on the morsel of quantity I received.  I can't speak about it much since the star of the meal came right after; Galbi, Bulgogi and Spicy Pork.  The meats were all well seasoned and I barely used the oil and salt for dipping.  Our waitress would always ask us how we liked our meat temperature which is always a plus; rare indeed please!  The staff was on point that night since after every choice of meat they changed out our grill tops.  This process really helped by keeping the flavors of the type seasoning and meats separated allowing you to taste each to it's full potential.    In the end, SeoulPHX really had something going!  Service was on point, except they need to figure out how to deal with check separation for larger groups; 3 cards per party isn't going to cut it.  The marination of the cuts of meat was solid and overall ambiance was well done! - Enjoy!",

I've gone to quite a few Korean bbq restaurants and for the price, quality of food, quality of service, and overall atmosphere, Seoul BBQ and Sushi has all of them beat.   My girlfriend and I ordered the dinner for two and got the short ribs and pork belly. The short ribs were well marinated and juicy. The pork belly were great cuts and some of the best I've had. The sides are always my favorite at a Korean restaurant and the selection here was amazing. The simplicity of Korean dishes can sometimes get ruined by not allowing it to stand on itself. Seoul does not have this problem.   We have definitely found a place to go back to and it's great for small or large groups. Thank you to the staff for making it great. We were celebrating my birthday a little early and this was quite the treat!",

The side dishes are unlimited, but they ran out of many of the things we liked. The chive pancake was super oily, in fact out of the 5 people I dined with no one ate it. The pork belly samgyeosal or something like that, was super thick and fatty. Not the good, melt in your mouth kind of fat either. They have some marinated beef that was pretty good. This place is pretty mediocre, but since there isnt many other korean bbq places in phoenix it may be your only option. If this is the only place near you, then it will suffice. I would not go out of my way to come here again.",

I lived in NorCal for a few years as a university student, where I tried KBBQ for the first time and was kind of sad that I wasn't going to get the opportunity to have good Korean food again. But I was wrong! This place is a gem.  All of the meats are fresh, the side dishes are well-seasoned and consistently refilled, and the service is awesome! Many KBBQ places tend to be kind of hands off, but the servers here check on customers often, will help flip the meat, etc.   Furthermore, the portion sizes are generous. We bought the KBBQ combo for two people and had enough leftover food to feed another person. While it's kind of pricey, it's reasonably priced considering the quality of meats (and how expensive KBBQ is in general).",

    "text": "We did not order the Korean bbq so this review is purely on the Sushi menu at lunch time. Overall very poor experience at this restaurant.  We ordered the Sushi & Sashimi Lunch Combo. Description: Chef's choice 5pc sashimi and nigiri served with California maki. Served with Miso soup  What we got was: - California maki where the crab was basically a crab salad that was more mayo than crab - No miso soup was ever provided - Received 5 small pieces of sashimi, 3 tuna and 2 pieces of one other fish, both did not taste very fresh - 2 pieces nigiri, also not very fresh and covered in onions to mask the taste  From the description in the menu and the photo in that was in the menu it seemed like we were supposed to get 5 pieces of nigiri and 5 pieces of sashimi but that was not the case. Very disappointing for the $19.99 price tag and not worth the money.  Waiter was pleasant but ended up trying to tell us that their menu was going through an overhaul and they were fixing photos, prices etc.  Had to ask for water refills and the waiter only refilled one glass on the table even though both were empty.   We won't be coming back to this restaurant for sushi.",

    "text": "Enjoyable Korean experience!! The overall experience with the venue, service, and food was exceptional.   First, Banchan was most extensive with 16 items; I don't recall receiving this many banchan, ever. It included sweet potatoes, egg plant, pickled eggs, and two types of kimchee and many others. The variety seems to vary each day, and I enjoyed eating them every time I visited here.   I have tried bibimbop, bibim nang meon and gunmandu. Bibimbop, with mushroom, spinach, bean sprouts, hit the spot. Bibim nang meon was also right on. Mandu were delicious and not too greasy although deep fried, . The skin was crunch and the stuffing was very tasty. The venue is clean, the service very western (This is a good thing). First class all around! Even bori cha came in a double insulated carafe to keep it warm.  There were a couple of misses unfortunately.  Kimchee was off; perhaps this was intentional for more Western palate. The taste was shallow and sour (closer to sour kraut), and lacked pungent kimchee-ness (you know what I mean?). Also the fish cake was stiff and skinny.   Despite a couple of misses, this was an exceptional dining experience; it deserves 5 stars. An amazing array of Banchan surely deserve 5+ stars. When it is all said and done, despite a couple of misses, I believe this place serves well the general population with \"slightly westernized\" Korean food without losing the core of Korean-ness. \"Highly Recommend\" is my rating for Korean food lovers, korean food novices and my friends.",

With that being said, it is by far the most expensive BBQ. I went to this location only once so I do not have anything to say about the services other than that they were OK. They ran out of side dishes and I was really disappointed, since we paid 39.99$ for each plate of meat. The portion is small too. However, do give it a try but you have been warned about the price for its portion and quality!  If you are going with a big party of 6+, I recommend to call in and make a reservation. They do have private rooms for such party.",

Come to find out later that our wonderful server Jonathan was the owner's son and he had such a kind, knowledgeable, masterful presence and walked us through the key dishes and all the side dishes and utensils to really invite us into the best way to enjoy the food and experience. You get so much more than your money's worth with the food, we were so full and had leftovers after tasting so many amazing flavors in the side dishes, appetizers, entrees, and the finishing note of sweetness in the rice drink they have. The restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous and I can't wait to go back with a party to make use of one of the luxurious looking private rooms around the building.  After our amazing, above and beyond experience, we had the absolute joy of happening to run into the owner, Albert, as we were leaving. He so sincerely appreciated our input and review and I was thrilled to be able to tell him in person what an absolute success his restaurant is to have delivered immaculate food, service, experience, and pricing all in one. Instantly my new favorite restaurant and my friend and I cannot wait to be back with more company.  Keep doing what you're doing, 11/10 will recommend and dine again!",

We walked in 30 minutes before closing, and all but a few of the menu items were available to us due to them shutting down certain machines needed for some dishes. We drove a long way into town and really wanted some comfort food, which is exactly what we found here with the tofu stews and bibimbap. Our food came with an overwhelming number of sides, all of which were delicious (they may take some getting used to if you're not familiar with Asian/Korean food).   We were greeted and checked on upon by an older man and woman, who I assumed to be the family that owned the place.

Not to mention that they really load you up on banchans!! Oh my lord!! And to top it all off, the service was absolutely excellent. I was blown away; my three month old daughter was extremely fussy and screaming bloody murder while we were eating... when all of a sudden one of the workers just came and wanted to hold my screaming daughter for me so I could eat!!

I enjoyed the fried dumplings, all the side dishes, kalbi tang, gom tang, yuk gae jang and tofu soup. Especially tofu was home made and my dad loved it.

    "text": "For a first timer, this is the place to go. But it doesn't end there, my friend from LA who brought me with him for dinner is a longtime lover of Korean BBQ, and according to him LA is the place to be for it, but even he loved it! Let's stick to my review though: the food was great, but I don't have enough experience to compare it to anything. However, I can say it was very flavorful and our server did a good job grilling it up. David (our server) was very knowledgeable, professional, and personable. He answered all of my questions and made suggestions that I could not be happier with. The ambience and environment was very enjoyable, music was at a nice volume, and the bathrooms are SICK. Prices were more than fair for the food we received, let alone the service that came with it. Will definitely be returning!",

This place was pretty busy when we visited and quite a few people waiting to get seated.  We ordered the combo A which was a lot of food for 2 people.  The server did all the cooking and we just enjoyed the eating.  A lot of small dishes.  The waiters and servers were all nice and very professional.  We will definitely bring people back next time.",

    "text": "So I was visiting some family in the Phoenix area. I drove past this restaurant when i was in town for a conference, but sadly it was not open. I went to another Korean place that did not suit my taste buds.  I was very thrilled to find that this place was open this time around. Let's just say, it didn't disappoint at all! My first impression was very good. Friendly service, clean restaurant, and it's big. We had a large group so we sat in one of the private rooms. Enough about that.   The FOOD was really, really good. I don't want to say it's the best ever because that wouldn't be fair. Everyone has different tastes. Let me just say that across the board, everything that I tried was DELICIOUS. We had a variety of appetizers. The chicken wings and potstickers were gone instantly! We had some different soups and noodle dishes, some sushi and of course the BBQ. They have a wide variety of meat cuts and cooking at the table was not only fun, but obviously you control how much it's cooked. I prefer my BBQ with some pink, but my kids like it a little more well done. The exhaust fans do a nice job of minimizing the smoke when you are cooking. The Dolpan was one of my favorites. My sister had the Galbi Jim which really was phenomenal. The beef was so tender and juicy! The Tofu Kimchi Jaeyuk (which is a spicy pork dish) and the Ojing-O Bokum (spicy squid) were also table favorites. There were lots of banchan (little side dishes) which came out. Some I had never had before at other Korean places. Always fun to try new things.   The drink menu had some fun cocktails and the owner even came by and brought a couple new creations to try. They had a nice selection of Korean beverages like Soju and makkoli and of course beer and whiskey. I didn't even take a look at the wine selections. I needed to leave something new to try for next time.   I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in the Phoenix area!",

The entire staff, the many servers and bussers have a very Korean like work ethic.  The food was spot on!  The tables, the bar, the rooms - Spot on!  Then there is the food. Having spent 10 days in Buson, S Korea, I can tell ya that there is nothing but perfection here!  Home made tofu in the soup, perfectly cut and marinated meats, 14 tiny bowls of tasty & authentic accompaniments circled the grill. Oh, JUST GO HERE!!!  You'll be thrilled you did.

    "text": "This restaurant was one of the first that came up after we unpacked in our hotel room and started searching for dinner places on Yelp. The close location, excellent reviews and interesting menu made it a no brainer. Unfortunately Google Maps took us around the block a couple of times. Also the name in Yelp is Seoulphx but the exterior of the building just reads Korean BBQ. Heads up if you get confused.  Once inside we were quickly seated and informed how the process works. You can cook your entree yourself at the table or have the chef do it. We opted for the later and our beef bulgogi was perfectly done. In addition you have 12-15 small side dishes along with rice as part of the meal. We loved them all even the funky little fish mixed with hot peppers. For a finish you are offered slightly fermented rice drink which was delicious. The owner even shared how they make the kimchi.  We will return!",

    "text": "Food runner served my soup to someone else then served it to me thinking I wouldn't notice. I had a seaweed salad with sashimi. Sashimi wasn't fresh with the exception of the salmon. Soup was bland even with the sides. The sides are basically just different types of pickled cabbage/kimchi. I wish I could've gotten some rice paper with it or at least large leafs of lettuce or cabbage to mix it with my rice to enjoy. I had to ask for extra rice because the one that goes with the meal is a quarter cup serving. I also noticed that the waiters have to cook the bbq for you on your table which defeats the purpose. I'm fairly disappointed. I'm new to Phoenix and I haven't found a reasonably priced Korean/Japanese/Thai/Chinese anything. Places out here think it's ok to overprice because they're the only option in the area. Honestly nothing compares to the places in LA. The hostess was really nice and they have metal chopsticks Which is the only reason why I'm giving ANY stars. I was thinking of not posting anything because I don't like giving bad yelp reviews, but I felt like it was a responsibility to post my experience.",

Our family of four chose to have the Korean BBQ of Bulgogi beef and the other choice was pork belly. Both were delicious and tasted wonderful with the multiple side items of pickled to mild vegetables. The rice was SO good! They gave a complimentary desert drink at the end that was reminiscent of horchata. A tad pricey for Korean BBQ, but the quality and quantity was well worth the cost.",

I enjoy eating Korean food so much, I decided to drive over to the other side of town just to have some jjigae.   Best decision EVER. My experience was amazing here! I felt welcome and at home Right away. From the hostess, to the servers, and the owner, service was excellent and the food was delicious! I ordered the sundubu jjigae, and it was absolutely phenomenal! It had the perfect level of spiciness to it with great flavor! High five to the cook(s) running the kitchen- My dish was brought out with a nice rumbling bubble to it :)  The owner, Albert, was very personable and I had a great time chatting with him about Korean cuisine amongst other things. Before I left, he had me try a few flavors of soju and I gotta say I can't believe I had never tried it sooner. ALL of the flavors I sampled were very smooth and refreshing. He was also so kind to offer me a nice refreshing rice drink that helps aid in digestion. I hope to come back here one day, and if I do ever end up in Phoenix again I will be sure to make a stop!   It's a shame I can't take this restaurant back to Austin, but thank you for the wonderful experience :)",

Looks like they did extensive renovations though as no hint of TGI Friday's remains; it's gorgeous inside and out.   They provide very extensive menu from BBQ to stews to salads to sushi. We wanted to try everything on the menu but had to settle with Gamja-tang, soon-tofu, and sashimi salad with kimchee pancake for appetizer. Our order came with table full of banchan, too many to count. It's so amazing that each of these morsels were so tasty. They could open up banchan store and I'd be coming here just for that. Everything is authentic too.   Did I mention they make their own tofu and mandoo (potsticker) from scratch? That was a bonus!   Even though we were full from the side dishes before our entrees arrived, we still managed to taste everything. The kimchee pancake is made fresh had nice bite to it. The stew was amazing. My son said it was the best in Arizona. The sashimi salad was so fresh, tasted like the chef just finished cutting up the vegetables. The sauce paired nicely with the crunchiness of lettuce and cabbage and cold/fresh sashimi. Would definitely get this again to share. The soon-tofu was good (spicy is very spicy though...get medium instead). Needless to say, we had to bring leftovers home. We packed the leftover banchan too!   The service was excellent. They were very attentive. They've been open for about 2 months and still in the process of training new employees but you wouldn't know this from the excellent service we received. They still haven't had official grand opening so I'd definitely try them out before they have lines out the door. We might be back tomorrow.",

My parents really only eat Asian food, and finding legitimate asian food that isn't in a hole-in-the-wall looking place is rare. I came across this on Yelp and decided to give it a try.   They have Korean and Japanese food. We ordered the home-made dumplings, seafood pancake, Samgyetang (chicken ginseng soup), and galbi.  Everything we tried was honestly very good. Everything was presented very nicely and picture worthy, and it tasted great! The side dishes are some of the best side dishes I've had. They are presented so well, and unlimited refills on those as well. Radish soup was great!   I also like the authenticity of this place. My parents wanted hot water, and they got barley tea, which is just made from roasted barley, to help aid digestion. Apparently it's a staple to Korean meals, and I love that they gave us that instead of just plain hot water.  A lady came over as we were eating the samgyetang, and she was telling us how to eat it. It's a ginseng soup with a whole stuffed chicken in it, ain't that easy to eat that thing, so thanks for helping us out.  Our server Ed was very attentive as well, and never forgot a thing that we asked.   All in all, It is much more expensive than other Korean bbq places. But, I can also see where the extra cost is coming from, and to me it was definitely worth that something extra! It was a great dining experience from beginning to end, and I will definitely come back for a nice dinner out or another celebration!",

    "text": "I drove out here to enjoy some Korean food that I have been craving. I lived in South Korea for two years and grew to love the cuisine. For my first order, I got the kimchi jigae. It's a hotpot like stew and it had all the flavors that i remembered. I just wish it just came with more especially considering the price. The sides that came with the meal, were all pretty good. My favorite were the kimchi and the potatoes. Overall the food was great but the portions were small.  The staff was super polite. This place had a mixture of Korean old ladies and younger staff of different ethnicities. My water never went dry with how much they paid attention. The restaurant is very clean and modern. It's honestly really nice inside.   Me and my buddy weren't expecting a military discount but we came in uniform and got one without asking.",

I think there was 16 types.  the bimimbap was good.",

    "text": "They are very friendly.   They start your meal with a clear soup, with thinly sliced turnip and small bits of beef. It's a simple soup but I enjoyed it very much.   We ordered jumuleok, crispy rice sushi, shrimp tempura, japchae, and yukgaejung.  I might have spelled those incorrectly, and I've noticed they are spelled differently at different restaurants. Oh well.   The shrimp tempura is pretty standard, except it only has 3 pieces. The dipping sauce was a nice flavor, fairly standard as well.   The crispy rice was fried sushi rice topped with spicy tuna and avocado. I love the different textures/mix of flavors. You get 4 pieces.   The yukgaejung is a spicy soup with beef and I think it has sweet potato noodles in it with some wood ear mushrooms.   This place has a lot of sides so you get a lot of options with your kbbq order. The jumuleok was okay. I don't really have a whole lot to say about it. It was different than our normal kbbq place.   They don't have hot green tea. I was a tad disappointed. They had a barley tea which they said was very good but I wasn't in the mood to try a new tea.   Their servers have the ability to take your card right at your table. That's nice they don't make you wait a long time.   The restroom is very clean. I appreciate that.   All in all, we had an enjoyable meal, and had a lot of food to take home.",

    "text": "We visited Seoul BBQ for the first time last night with four adults and two children; we all left stuffed to the brim and deliriously happy.  As one previous poster stated, the menu seems expensive, but you definitely get your money's worth!  We ended up getting the kids an order of fried rice to share while the adults went for one of the combos.  The combo we chose said it would feed about 4 people and it came with all of the little sides that Korean BBQ comes with plus an vegetable pancake appetizer,  a salad I had not seen in my previous Korean food experiences, and a soup.  Salad? AH-MAZING!  Vegetable pancake: DELISH.  The sides and the sauces and the servers and the meat? NO WORDS.  Even the kids tried some of the meat options--there were four--and enjoyed them.  My oldest son was practically drinking the red, soy sauce-based sauce.  The adults were stuffed by the end of the second meat!  That combo was over $100 and it could have easily fed all six of us.  As much as we go out to eat, I think this is the first time we've all left in such a state of euphoria, completely satisfied by the food, the experience, and the servers.  Several servers worked our table and each one was kind, patient, and happy to explain anything we asked.  My only negative point is I'm sad we waited this long to try this place!  Can't wait to return!",

Food was yummy, however out server was terrible. About a 20 year old girl with rings in herr face and bad makeup and attitude. If you wanna charge a premium price for food it should be served by at least a competent server. I spoke with some of my co-workers about our experience when we got back to the office and basically the same problem, mostly young inexperienced servers who do a poor job. Now some people did say they had more mature servers and the experience was awesome, unfortunately that was not ours.",

    "text": "The food is good, but nowhere near worth it when it comes to the price for the Korean BBQ. Sushi is good and worth the money, but the BBQ is extremely overpriced. $30 for $3 worth of frozen meat is ridiculous. With a party of 5, it took 20 minutes between the first entree and the last entree to hit the table, with the last entree being frozen beef that they call bulgogi. The short ribs cost  $35 where you would pay $15-20 for better quality and more meat at any of the other Korean BBQ joints in town. The service is also REALLY bad. The server was a nice guy, but he definitely needs more training. Also, random staff members would just walk up and start putting meat on out table grill. It was extremely rude and unprofessional. There needs to be a change in service very quickly or this place will not last. The best part of the meal was the mandu and that they have Hite. Other than that, only come here for sushi or the appetizers and the beer. DO NOT waste your money in the BBQ. If you want Korean BBQ of the same quality, go to Koryo at 43rd ave and Peoria and save 50%. We paid $80 for a $40 meal. More than likely will not be coming back.",

They greeted us & the manager/owner was even there to help us make choices & introduce us to her staff & the restaurant in general. They put us in a private room that was a little on the small side, but was comfortable. The previous room could only fit 8 comfortably. We asked for a recommendation & were shown some package meal options. I think we got the $99 one and it was perfect. We had several choices of meat to try (which she helped us choose as well. Keep in mind that this isn't our first Korean experience. We've tried Yakiniku in Hawaii, and 2 of the other \"authentic\" well-known Korean restaurants here in AZ. But since this place was new to us AND they had MUCH more food choices than we were used to in a Korean restaurant in general, we thought it would be more efficient to ask for suggestions.) The meal came with soup (I think you can choose from 2 different ones, though there are more on the menu if you buy seperately) salad, and I *think 2 appetizers. We order shrimp siomai (though I'm not sure if that's what its called on the menu) and some kind of \"pancake\". It was all delicious & the kids enjoyed everything as well.  Everyone had their own lidded bowl of rice, and I think you can ask for more. Not sure if its free or not.  The salad was a good amount, but we would have preferred more soup. They brought out only two small/medium sized bowls that we had to share amongst ourselves. We asked for one to be spicy and one not to be spicy. (Spicy definitely tasted FAR superior, though the non wasn't bad. Just obviously not as flavorful.) The banchan was amazing! They gave us SO many, and some I've never had at any of the other Korean restaurants! You can ask for more or less & pick which ones you'd prefer as well. They have a system where you can press a button on the wall if you need them. And the lady in charge welcomed us to call on them as often as we needed. They had 2 servers there cooking the meat & serving us whenever someone needed more food. Once all the meat was cooked, they left us to enjoy the food & company, but made sure to remind us to push the button for anything. The service was excellent, and the food was just as good if not better! We arrived on a Saturday and were the first people there, so maybe that had something to do with it. By the time we left our private room, we noticed that there were many families & couples eating too. For those who care, the restrooms were immaculate and the entire atmosphere was just very enjoyable. Its much more upscale than your favorite hole-in-the-wall Korean place, but I can tell you that its just as good. Sometimes you get quality but they skimp on the quantity ( and vice versa)....but not here! Everything & everyone was ON POINT! If you've got a large crowd and they love Korean soup, I suggest ordering extra if you're buying one of the package deals. But other than that....totally worth the drive and money. (We were coming from Avondale & Goodyear.) My brother & sister in law were actually visiting from Japan and are used to good Yakiniku, and were extremely pleased with this restaurant! We ALL were! Thank you for the wonderful lunch Seoul! I'm praying someone buys me a gift certificate for my birthday & Christmas cause this is definitely my new favorite restaurant.",

My husband said the food was excellent and begged me to try it or at least talk to them and see if they could be safe.  I did and the owner and the manager came and spoke to me.  The owner told me one of his children is allergic to seafood and peanuts and that he is very aware and careful with cross contamination.  The kitchen is separated so despite a terrifyingly fish heavy menu I was able to order a starter and a noodle dish that were excellent and I'm happy to report, not cross contaminated.  I am sad that all of the bonchan was not able to be guaranteed safe so I did not get to enjoy all of the awesome little snacks but it looked really good.  My non allergic table mates said it was good.  Because each table has a vent hood  neighboring tables' cooking doesn't affect other diners.  The restaurant is beautiful and the service is good and despite a menu loaded with every kind of thing that could kill me or ruin a good 4-5 months of my life, their kitchen practices are sound.  My only issue is that I wish the bonchan was kept on the fish free side so I could have enjoyed it too.  Overall will definitely be back!",

Our waitress was attentive and very knowledgeable.   I know this has been beaten to death, but the banchan was both extensive and extremely edible, and refilled after any request. (I'm a sucker for fish cake).  The meat itself was also very succulent. The brisket was industry standard, it's not my favorite dish, but the bulgogi was loaded with flavor and not overloaded with fat.",

We got the fried rice and the beef and pork dumpling soup.",

My husband and son shared a BBQ combo of short ribs and bulgogi. They loved it! Came with all the little bowls of goodness, shumi, soup, rice, a veggie pancake and some veggies and salad. Literally too much food. I got a bibim bop, with a squeeze bottle of gochuchang on the side. So good! I haven't been this full since 2010! The service was exceptional. I tried a soju and it was pleasant but i don't have to have that again. They brought a little Korean dessert drink with the bill that tasted like iced apple pie. It was good but too full to enjoy. I can't wait to go back and pace myself a little better next time.",

    "text": "UPDATE: It has been a week and no one has made the effort to contact or reach out to me. I contacted the restaurant through their website as well (through email) and still, no response. They did, however, pull $80 out of my checking account (there was no shame in accepting the tip I left the waitress). I will settle my humiliation with this update and leave it at that.   This review is for the 3rd time I came to SeoulPHX. The first time I chose the 2nd choice for $99.99, I believe. The second and third time I came to this establishment, I chose the 1st choice for $69.99. The first two visits were phenomenal. This is why I came the third time around. (Prices reflecting how much we paid to eat here)   The reason I am giving this restaurant one star is based off of my last and final visit. I ordered samgyupsal and galbi (choice order #1) the waitress who brought the meat and all our sides to us pulled a LONG piece of hair OUT of the samgyupsal. I looked up at her shocked and she said, \"I'm so sorry. No one in the back has long black hair except me so this just happened right now.\" She then proceeded to take out all the meat surrounding the long black hair and gave the samgyupsal a stir on the grill. She pulled ANOTHER long black hair out (W T F) and said, \"oh no.... I'm sorry sorry.... uhhhhh....\" She gave me a long look in the face (which meant she wanted forgiveness) and I said, \"can you replace it?\" SHE SAID \"NO I COULD NOT!\" She just took more meat OUT around the hair and that was it. My husband just said, \"don't worry they'll bring out more meat for us and probably discount us for the hair. No need to make a scene.\" We are NOT confrontational people. Please understand our position as I suffer from depression and anxiety and he is introverted. Of course in our minds we could do anything, but out loud, it is difficult to stand up and demand proper treatment we deserve.   At the end of our meal, NO! She did not replace the meat and when I asked for the discount because of the hair incident, you know what the waitress said? \"No. I can't do that. But I can give you 10% military discount.\"   Well. My husband said, \"let it go. I will talk to the manager.\" Well, low and behold there was no manager in the store who could assist us.   Moral of the story. Stand up for yourself and demand they change your meat when the waitress pulls out not one but TWO long strands of hair from your samgyupsal right in front of you. Also, don't let your anxiety and fear of confrontation (even if you are in the right) keep you from NOT tipping the waitress (YES. I tipped her. I am not a prick)   I want to call the health inspector because I feel like the waitress and this business thinks of my family and I as indecent because we didn't do ENOUGH to stop the waitress from serving us samgyupsal mixed human hair for lunch.   Shirley (name we were given as the manager) please give me a call. Thank you.  I know they could have easily just plated the meat differently and served us the same human haired mixed samgyupsal but at least I would have been satisfied with the effort to make us think we were being served with dignity. Today, they did not show any effort to correct the issue.",

Meal came with rice, a beef broth soup with asian radish, and 7 small side dishes of different cold items. Everything we tried was good.

I've been hearing great things about Seoulphx and for the most part, the food was excellent.  They have a great lunch menu and the place is clean.  I enjoyed the flavorful LA Galbi, the pre-meal soup was hot and tasty, and the sikhye at the end of the meal was cold and refreshing.  They offer a huge array of banchan as well.  So why the two-stars?  The service was pretty great [Ale was sweet, the waiter was friendly, the Asian chick was cool] except for one waitress.  Just one waitress ruined my lunch for me --- one waitress dropping a plate of dumplings on me, that is.    I get that accidents happen.  I'm certainly no graceful ballerina but my goodness, the way she handled the situation really irked me.  She gave me some paper towels and a cup of club soda which was nice and she even replaced the items the sauce got splashed on.  The thing that annoyed me was what she said at the end of the meal when we were about to pay. \"Oh yeah! Would you like some vanilla mochi for me pouring mandu on you? I completely forgot!\" How can you forget when I have a huge slash of sauce across my chest and my jeans are now stained from mandu sauce?  The way she said it was off-putting.  She was very aloof about the whole situation.  I have no idea what her name is but she's the blonde chick with the tattoos on her forearm with a yellow manicure.  So we paid for our meal, even the dish that I'm currently wearing on shirt and jeans, without so much as an apology.  I'm not mad about the accident.  It happens.  But the handling of the situation was poor and she was very dismissive about the incidient and for that, I'm giving this place two-stars.  This was at 1PM in the day and now I'm going to have Seoulphx stains on me, smelling of pork & beef mandu for the rest of the day, and not even so much as management came by to apologize.  Bummer.",

We asked for our food to be cooked in the back as we had a 1 year old with us and we didn't want any burners on. Everything came out perfectly cooked and warm. There were so many sides our table was almost over flowing. I would say its a little pricey but you get what you pay for and man was the meat good and they did not skimp on anything. My favorite was the Galbi: Marinated short-rib (Boneless) They had sooo much flavor and there was plenty of meat. I highly recommend starting off with the GUN-MANDU (6pcs) Home made Deep Fried Dumpling they were perfectly fried. They also have tons of of things here besides Korean BBQ. Sushi, Soups, Cold and Hot noodle dishes, and giant macaroons. I think next time I'll come for lunch and try a Bento Box.",

    "text": "This is the type of restaurant that makes Phoenix a better city. The food is outstanding, they have a nice drink menu, and the layout is very well thought-out. Most significantly though, is that they have presented the Korean culture in its best light to an audience that may not have much exposure to it.  If you walk around on a Saturday evening, this restaurant, which is somewhat off the beaten path, is packed. Moreover, the majority of the diners are not Korean. I love that this place has the ability to bring in this much traffic and that they are able to present a very well-executed Korean culinary experience. They aren't watering it down or fusing it with the Western palate, and yet they are able to make it attractive enough for people to go out of their way to come out. It makes Phoenix the kind of city that has an outstanding Korean restaurant, not because it's in Koreatown or because there's a ton of Koreans next to it, we have it simply because Phoenicians like eating there. Finally, you can see the work ethic of their team when you realize they're open every single day of the year.  For completeness, the things I like about the food is having a ton of side dishes (usually 16), the vegetable pancake, and the bibimbap. Their japchae, bulgogi, and kalbi were all fine, to my palate just as good as the stuff I had when I visited S. Korea, but I'm not that discriminating on those dishes. Wife likes having sashimi as an option. Service was lightning fast and friendly.",

Definitely try the jjam bong (spicy seafood noodle). They are not stingy with their seafood.",

We took my boyfriends younger brother here for a belated birthday present. We order 3 different types of meat. It was one of their preset meals. Im sorry I cant remember which one it was.   Anyway, we ordered the chicken, LA galbi, and bulgolgi. It came with two appetizers and our choice of soup! And of course the pleathora of banchan.  The service at first was kinda iffy. The girls hair got into our food when she turned her head to check on the grill. I guess i feel like all of the long hair on anyones head should be pulled back. Especially if theyre handling our food.   She was new though so its understandable. Another gentlemen stepped in and took over most of the time. He had glasses and was very attentive to serving us.   Over all the food was amazing. And well worth the price tag. We each also got a dessert. My boyfriend ordered two types of Mochi. And myself and his brother ordered the shaved ice.   This will be a frequent stop for us for sure.",

Everything about the meal from the many many delicious side dishes to the perfectly marinated and tender bulgogi and short ribs was amazing! Prices are very reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get. And on top of a perfect meal, the service was unbeatable. You can tell the staff really work as a team and help each other out to make sure each table has the best experience possible. I will absolutely be recommending this place to all my friends and family and I can't wait to return!   After my most recent visit I felt the need to update my review. I am just blown away by this place! The food is always outstanding and completely satisfying to any craving you may have for Korean bbq! Visited today during lunch to find they have many good deals on lunch specials so prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and amount of food you get. Ordered the beef bulgogi which never disappoints! However this review is even more based on the staff. The customer service is outstanding and I love that there is such a family feel to it. Came here with my 2 year old (which we all know is not always easy when they're in their terrible 2's lol) he started to get a bit fussy but not once did I feel out of place or like they were annoyed with us which is honestly such a relief when your child starts to throw a fit in the middle of lunch. The table busser at the time along with one of the waitresses were extremely friendly! The waitress in particular who wasn't even our server at the time (and I wish I got her name because she was so awesome. She had braided hair and a gold nose ring) was absolutely amazing!! She stopped by our table to chat with my son, and after asking if it was okay he had some ice cream she took him to the back freezer, let him pick out what ice cream he liked and then presented him with a yummy plate of ice cream whip cream and chocolate syrup! My son was so happy and mom and dad were even happier getting to finish our meal in peace with him finally calming down lol. She wasn't even our waitress but simple stopped by our table out of kindness and I'm so appreciative for that! Kindness like hers along with the rest of the staff here should not go unnoticed! 5 stars over and over again!!! Thank you Seoul for always providing the upmost quality and service and always making my family feel so welcome here!! We are customers for life!!!",

Our server helped cook the meat at our table and did a great job at explaining what to do with all the food and sides. Well, you eat it, but if you're new to Korean BBQ, it can feel intimidating.  My last point is to not avoid this place because you aren't familiar with Korean cuisine. They have a broad menu of familiar dishes, but if you are feeling like you want to try a more authentic Korean experience, this is the place. The servers will walk you through and help with everything. You will NOT regret it.",

They have a lunch menu Monday through Friday.   We ordered Mandu and Haemul Pageon for appetizers.  There were 5 large pieces of fried Mandu well cooked well stuffed with delicious goodness. The pieces came out hot and not oily.  The Pageon covered the entire plate and was full of seafood. The edges were crusty and flavorful with wonderful texture. The insides were steaming and cooked just right, not doughy.    Yukyejjang came out in a nice thick bowel. The broth was hot with a delicious blend of spices and saltiness.  The meat and vegetables provided great texture and complement of flavors.   The Naengmyeon on the other hand is a cold dish.  The color was clear with hint of amber but to taste it was icy cold, refreshing and just a little bite from the mustard I added. The fresh made noodles were thin and had the appropriate wonderfully firm texture.  I drank in the broth then went to town on the noodles with the accompanying seasoned radish and cucumbers.   The Jjamppong came out with that steaming rich dark pepper red broth.  On the tongue it had a rich complement to heat, sweetness and smoke with flavors of the ocean.  The dish was filled with crabs, muscles, clams and shrimps in the shell. Delicious.   The Soon-tofu seafood style was also quite pleasing.   Just writing this is making me hungry for more.   So far this is the best Korean restaurant I have encountered in Arizona.   The service was excellent and the bathroom was very clean and modern.",

The owners have hired an outstanding chef. The decor is imported from Korea. They have the individual rooms for small groups. They have a full bar (including soju). I am not a sushi eater but my friends are and they were highly impressed.",

Restaurant is roomy and clean and the waiters/waitresses very nice. Now to the food.. ordered three dishes .. Kalbi, soon-tofu and the grilled mackerel .. we opted to grill our own meat at the table. As the other Yelpers have noted a good variety of bonchan (side dishes). The Kalbi comes out boneless (wish they left the bone on) and the cut is quite thick. I would have preferred the more traditional thinner cut with rib on. The marinade was tasty-more on the sweeter side. The soon tofu soup was quite good. We asked for medium spicy but I would say it was on the milder side. If you like medium spicy ask for spicy.. the bonchan although a good selection was noticeably sweet. Overall, the experience was good. There's a bell for each table that is used to call your server. Foodie checking out...",

Both were larger portions than most restaurants and so I was OK with the higher prices.  Service, location, parking, food, and decor were all superb!  I, hopefully, will be back on my next trip there.",

    "text": "First time here with family from out of town and the meals started to arrive way before our drinks. We were all dying of thirst and pressed our call button as we were sitting in one of the booths. Server came in and got our drink orders again. Still our drinks came 15 minutes later. We pressed our call button and they shut it off on their end. We pressed it again and then they came in with our drinks. This wasn't even the worst of it. My sister in law was feeding herself and her daughter. My sister in law felt something in her mouth after having a spoonful of rice. It was a pretty decent size metal in her rice. We definitely rang our call button to our server. He displayed his sincere apology and went to talk to the manager. Their compensation was to give us all free dessert on the house. After displaying her loss of appetite after the encounter and that it there would've been a possibility in her daughter eating that metal, they offered a different food type (dessert). We never got to actually speak to a manager which shows the professionalism of the restaurant. They offered us a 10 dollar gift card to use on a return trip. We started we were out of town and that we were not going to be back here. I managed to have them use it on our current transaction and they did. Overall, service for food wasn't bad but being that restaurant only had 6 tables filled, that was horrible service to get just drink orders. Management did nothing to help ease my sister in laws mind after that encounter with the metal in the food. 10 dollars doesn't suffice. We were definitely not asking for a free meal and not even 50 percent off of the meal. We were definitely disappointed in management not even speaking to us personally and helping to resolve the issue. Having a piece of metal in food should not be resolved with free dessert. We would've just been satisfied with 10-20% off at most or not paying for the rice dish we found the metal in. I definitely will not come by here if we ever come back into town.",

I did not do their Kbbq but each meat plate is ~$15-25. Super expensive IMO. Might as well go to an ayce Kbbq and pay $20-25 to get ayce and different types of meat.   I've only been here once and will probably never return. I only ordered one thing: Yukgaejang. It's the worse yukgaejang that I've had and I've ordered it at all of other Korean restaurants in Glendale, AZ.  Broth: super bland (and I'm a very bland eater!) Very little ingredients were given for the soup.  Place is nice, spacious and clean. Staff, however, were a bit odd. One of the lady (probably one of the owner) came over to us as we were eating and instructed us on how to eat our food. She told us to put the rice into our soup and also that the broth is \"very good\" so make sure to drink all of it. I don't mind if she thought we didn't know how to eat korean food and was trying to help us but she continued to stand there watching us even after she nodded and smile at her. No! I do NOT want to dump the rice into the bowl of soup! She finally left after I guess she realized we were not going to follow her instructions. However, that is not it. As we continued to eat our food, two staff members (I don't remember if one of it was the same lady that gave us instructions) were standing behind a counter wiping dishes or doing something but they were talking to each other and staring at us. It was VERY OBVIOUS they were talking about us. Obviously idk what they were discussing but it was very rude.",

My first visit was about a week ago and I visited this same restaurant 3 times already!! I tried different menus every time and was so surprised by the fact that everything i tried was soooo good!! If you want to try a real authentic Korean food, this place should be the first place to visit for sure!! I'm so excited that we have this restaurant in our area. This is something that you won't normally get even in Korea. And it reminds me of my childhood memory with my grandma who always made a great food. Also, the servers were amazing too. They have a bell system and you can push the button whenever you need anything but i barely used them since the servers always knew the need in advance and came to us. All of them were nice and kind, and best of all, they got customer's need right away that i didn't really have to explain much about what i want. Overall, i think even 5 stars are not enough for this restaurant and highly recommend this place for both Koreans(Try it and feel how authentic it is. You can't compare any others in U.S.) and people from other cultures.(Servers are real nice people and they are always willing to explain what the food is and how to eat. If you're interested in Korean food, this would be the perfect place to start) Oh and i usually visit as a small group with my friends but i saw they also have several, pretty big private rooms maybe for meetings or birthday parties i guess? So if you're looking for a place for a big party, this should be one of your considerations.",

We both were so excited to have a Korean BBQ near us, granted it's not AYCE like we are use to in socal. Never again.  We will drive to Tempe for our Korean BBQ. Teach your staff to acknowledge your customers,  even a \"we will be right with you\" is sufficient enough.",

They have a bulgogi stew that is suppose to have beef bulgogi meat, vegetables and a clear noodle made of sweet potatoes. Both times I have ordered it the noodles have been missing and there is hardly any broth or veggies. So I feel like I'm just eating meat with a little extra liquid. We usually order take out as I have 2 toddlers and another on the way... They have messed up the order almost every single time. One time I was missing the vinegar and mustard for my mul naeng meun dish... Another time I was missing the sauce for my gun Mandu, and another time I was missing the side of rice that should have come with the bulgogi stew. Twice they had to call and confirm what I ordered as they got confused. Needless to say... For the price I'd expect much more than what I have received.",

The seafood soonsubu jigae was spot on, slightly bigger than at other Korean restaurants. The jjampong was packed with a wide array of seafood, mussels, clams, shrimp, squid, octopus, crab and plenty of noodles, super tasty. The kalbi was expertly marinated and cooked nice and tender. The ojingeo bokkeum (spicy stir fried squid) was so delicious, you'll want extra rice. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive and brought whatever refill banchan we requested. The decor is very modern with Korean touches sprinkled throughout. Best of luck to this restaurant, it's a welcome addition to this part of town. Wil definitely come back when craving authentic Korean food.",

The service was outstanding and the food far exceeded expectations. Make sure you try their Galbi- it was premium quality and the most tender short rib I've ever tasted!!! The number of side dishes were around 14 and they also served us tea and soup in the beginning of the meal and ended the meal with a sweet drink. Definitely a must try! I believe it's the best in the valley!  What also is great are the prices!!! They charged us 18% gratuity for our large party but even with the tip, we paid around $200 for our whole group! Whattt??!! Usually at Korean restaurants, we usually spend $70-80 for just me and my hubby. Prices and quality of food can't be beat!!! You won't be disappointed.",

Our group ordered several sushi rolls and I cannot say I have a single complaint. The sushi was fresh, rich and the rice used was perfectly firm, but soft!

Those small dishes taste just fine. The kimchi is not that good. If you wanna know good kimchi, try the brand of Chonga, I personally recommend that. The staff are pretty friendly enough and take good care of you as long as they never bother me too much.  Well, for the taste I might have them 4 stars but 5 stars for the variety. To be fair!

The short answer is \"the food quality sucks because they have to meet a certain price\".   This restaurant is not the cheapest, but the food is absolutely first rate.

While the restaurant name, Chinese furniture in the entrance, the inclusion of shumai on the menu, and lack of any Korean speaking people when we arrived had us nervous, the service was great and the food was good.   While it was more expensive than I think it should be in a town like Phoenix, if you are craving Korean food it will get the job done.   My favorite was the spicy squid.

The meal comes with a course of samples that were fun and tasty to try. The sushi was good as was the katsu chicken. The poke wasn't exactly how I thought it would be and was mixed in with a lettuce and mayo combination that was a little like coleslaw (the only description I can think of) that tastes ok but not what I was looking for. They had no issue with taking it back and not charging us for it. We grabbed a few of the ice cream macaroons to go which we fabulous! We will def be back to try some of the other menu items.",

We loved the impressive assortment of banchan (side dishes) that came with the meal and left the restaurant too stuffed to even think about dessert. Although we've had Korean BBQ several times over the years it was then first time for our boys. I'm glad we were able to give them such a \"legit\" first impression. Who knows, maybe they'll even try some of the spicy banchan next time!",

Definitely the best Korean BBQ place in AZ in terms of decorations and atmosphere. Others look a little dirty and cramped.  The service both times has been great. We had an issue with how fatty the meat was but the servers and the chef did their best to make sure we were satisfied. They asked us multiple times how we were doing so A+ for service. Plenty of good side dishes too. It is a bit pricey although the portions were good. The sushi and other dishes aside from the Korean BBQ were delicious too. So give this place a try! They're new but definitely worth the trip.",

First of all, it's clean. And I know what you're thinking, it's new so what? But it's beautiful inside too! The owners put a lot of thought into this place. It looks like it should be in New York or something. Cute accent pieces are placed around the room. You just walk in and say \"wow what a great place!\" Now the food... what can I say?? Everything we got was SO GOOD! They brought out so many side dishes too!! Normally I have to ask for more cuz places only bring out 5, but look how many there were in my photo! All of the main dishes were delicious too.   !!!! The service is impeccable too! Such nice people. They really care about what they're doing. And if you see Min (I think she's the manager), ask her about the food and what they prepare fresh each day. It's amazing!",

Apparently, therestaurant recently opened for business and the local staff seem to like the venue. There were 5 of us.  Upon entering, I noticed immediately the scale of operation akin to that of what we usually see in L.A., or SFO. The decor and ambience gets 5 stars. Upon seating, we were promptly asked if we wanted any beverages. Throughout the dining process, the servers(multiple, not just the one assigned to our table) came frequently and asked if there were any other items we wished. Service gets 5 stars.  The side dishes(or condiments) however, while many(16 of them), definitely resembling that of authentic Korean food in terms of appearance, presentation, and aroma, the tastes on all of their side dishes fall on the bland side.  As for the traditional BBQ dishes, they tasted good; not excellent. What would have made excellent would have been consistency. Uniquely and oddly, their #20 and #21, both ribs, one with marination and one without some were very tender and some were not within a same dish. I find that odd, how could beef in one dish differ in terms of texture and character. The food therefore gets 3 stars. I averaged out and gave the restaurant 4 stars overall.  I WOULD go back just to find out whether or not a meat in one given dish would taste and feel the same.",

Only negatives (and I'm being picky) we like our Kimchi more spicy and less fermented (fresher) and the chopped salad was soggy like the lettuce hadn't been dried much after washing it and it had no dressing on it. Just a small drizzle in one spot. Please fix this as I love sangchu geotjeori!  Also looking forward to the serving staff learning the Korean menu (how to pronounce and what it is) and being able to make recommendations from their knowledge to people that aren't familiar with Korean food. But no worries as this place has barely just opened!  So very happy to have this place in Phoenix!! Can't wait to go back!   Also - you can cook your food OR they can cook it for you!

Servers were helpful since neither of us have been to this restaurant and newbies on Korean BBQ.   The menu is very large and you could spend 20 minutes reading it. Good news is that you don't have to cook your lunch, they cook it for you in the kitchen. Lot of Korean and Japanese items on the menu.   Started off with a couple of appetizers including the recommended Goon Mandu which are beef and pork dumplings. We also ordered a shrimp appetizer that was chopped shrimp in a breaded coating.   I ordered a Dwaeja Bulgogi Bento Box which had a dumpling, egg roll, marinated thinly sliced pork shoulder, miso soup, salad, rice and a California roll. Other dining guest had the tuna poke salad that was large enough for two.  Service was good, you need to remember to ring a doorbell near your table otherwise you may not get your service. Some of the menu items looked expensive however the plates probably serve 3 people.   Lunch specials were reasonable and more than adequate sized portions. High points were the dumplings, the marinated pork shoulder was spicy and perfectly cooked, the cabbage salad had a very good dressing. Overall a very good dining experience.",

    "text": "When I first glanced at the menu, I thought that the food was quite expensive. Although when we got our food, I realized why! The serving was soooo huge and the bibimbap that's $18 can probably feed 2-3 people. The seaweed salad was A LOT too. Usually other restaurants have veggies of some sort under the seaweed salad and cheat it that way. Oh and their side dishes!!! Literally you can get full off of it (and you can get re-fills too of your favorite ones). For their KBBQ, I think it's too expensive and might as well go to an AYCE.   Aside from that, their employees are VERY - OVERLY friendly. I'm not complaining though. Lol.   Anyways, A+++ rating all around and I will definitely be back with my family in the future!",

The one sauce for the Korean wings reminded people at our table of a Bloody Mary/Bloody Caesar. The meat was cooked in front of us to perfection.  They even changed grill tops for one of our guests who has a beef allergy.  We had 9 people and had ordered the food for 5 people and we had left overs. The food was delicious with many great Korean flavors. The kimchi soup was a favorite of mine.  Will definitely come back when I visit Phoenix again.",

He was quick with refills, bringing requested items and being sure to change our grill plates at a very reasonable time. He even managed to handle our big family and their craziness. We greatly appreciate him going above and beyond for us. It made this experience and our late lunch here more worth it.  Now for the food... the marinated meat we ordered were just perfectly flavored and just the quality and taste of the meat felt way better than what we are used to at our home town. We devoured the multiple side plates and were very satisfied with them (specially the variety).  We will for sure come back and request Jonathan if he is still here.",

    "text": "My love of Korean food started with some of my Korean clients taking me to Korea Town in LA over 40 years ago. It's been tough finding quality Korean ever since, BUT I keep trying.  Good reviews on Yelp prompted us to drive out of our way from the hotel to give them a try. The good: service was outstanding, attentive, helpful and friendly; the menu was laid out with pictures and explanations that made it easy for first timers to comprehend (although we are not first timers); can cook meat yourself or they will do it; kimchee was varied, fresh and tasty; the chop chae. THE BAD: Korean BBQ is all about the meat! The meat was well seasoned and tasty, but barely edible given the amount of fat and gristle. How can you hit home runs in most other except the the reason for being there.  Quality control of the selected cuts of meat and even looking at it raw in the marinade as it was brought to our cooking table is unbelievable.   More shocking was the owner was working the dining room which is always nice to see, but he should be payingvattentionbtontgevmeat he's buying and how they cut it.",

The location itself a bit odd because it's facing the I-17/Black Canyon Highway which is one way and next to the corporate office & Pappadeaux Seafood, so if you miss the turn you have to drive all the way around to get back to the restaurant. I missed the turn and I ended up parking nextdoor at the Pappadeaux Seafood.  Anyhow the waitress was nice, food was good so we were happy.",

I started with some edamame which was a really good size for 2 people and some gyozas (I forgot what they were called here lol). The gyozas were so good and very filling. I ordered LA Galbi, that was very tasty. And they had so much side dishes! I also tried their Lagoon Punch and Melona Soju Cocktail and man they were awesome! What tops this off is how friendly and attentive the WHOLE staff were. They were so lovely! Herman was a great server and Eunhee tended to us very well! They were the best!

First, location is very clean and spacious. Service was prompt; Jonathan (mentioned in other reviews) is a rock star and also an NPR nerd, which I appreciate as a long time public radio and television professional. :-) Really, the whole service team was fantastic. I ordered galbi jumulleok (#21), which came with an overabundance of banchan. My favorite was the pickled daikon and the pancake. So many choices, though! My grilled meat was tender, lightly marinated and totally devoid of the tough parts which sometimes mar the chew. They were very quick to change out the grill plates and make sure food didn't burn. There's a small beer and wine list, and many Japanese items that I may check out next time. I will be back. With a group.",

And had the Mandu (dumpling soup) and my mom had the bibimbap. We shared everything and it was perfection!! Maybe when I gave them my review (which I kept below) they were having an off day, I highly recommend!!   This is my updated review. I initially gave them 4-5 stars!! The very first time I ever came w my mom and my two sisters a month ago was amazing!!!! I raved and told everyone I kno that this is legit the best Korean restaurant in town!!! We ordered soondae as an appetizer and you kno it's a good Korean restaurant when they give u so many side dishes and if the side dishes are good, it's usually a good indication of how good the food is at the restaurant.  The first time we went, I ordered the jjampong from their dinner menu; my mom ordered the bibimbap; my one sister ordered jjampong like me and my other pregnant sister ordered the Mandu (dumpling) soup. I mean it was all soooo amazing.  So it came as a complete shock n disappointment when we went again this past Thursday and everything was off! My mom, my gf, her mom and I went this time. My gf's mom ordered the galbi soup or . My mom ordered the  spicy beef soup and I ordered the combo: galbi and bibim naeng myun n my gf ordered her jjampong again. Well whatever broth they used for the galbi soup and spicy beef soup was bad!! Like it went sour!!! We could tell right away by the smell and taste that it was bad and the kitchen tried to mask that it went bad by adding tons of salt!! My god!!! Sooo salty!! But even w all that salt you could tell it went bad.   My galbi was extremely salty! Galbi is supposed to b somewhat sweet. Well this one was just straight up salty beef. We ent the galbi soup, my galbi and my mom's spicy beef soup back. They offered us a replacement. So my mom ordered the mandu dumpling soup and I got the spicy tofu soup. Well guess what? Both of them were way too salty and you could smell n taste whatever beef broth they were using, it went bad!! Not sure what happened this time in the kitchen... did the chef leave?? So I ended up eating rice and all the side dishes.   I will try one more time cuz all places could have an off day. So will keep you posted!",

The wings were also fantastic. Not all of the side dishes were a hit but with refills of the ones we liked, who cares? Definitely recommend this place!",

Food quality and presentation was wonderful. I definitely can't complain about that.",

They justify the higher cost by cooking all the meat for you at the grill that is at your table, which isnt something i was a fan of considering I actually like cooking all the meat they bring out and I'm pretty sure my grilling skills are better than my 16 year old waitress.   It's also super awkward when dinner with your girlfriend becomes dinner with your girlfriend and your waiter who's at your table cooking all the meat the entire time.   All the meat and sushi that I ate their was pretty good,  but it isnt any better than anyone else around here and it definitely isnt worth the price.",

As soon as we walked in, the place smelled AMAZING! We were greeted right away, and asked to put our name on the list. The place was packed (always a good sign)! We waited maybe a total of 15 minutes. When my husband explained to our server that this was my first time, she was sooo patient with me. She explained every one of the sides and how everything worked. The presentation was beautiful! I'm one who will try anything once, and I enjoyed everything! The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and the entire experience was great! We will DEFINITELY be back!",

More side dishes served with your BBQ than most Korean restaurants. Service was excellent & we got to chat with the manager which was nice. The only thing I think they could improve is that the BBQ should have been set hotter...to sear the meat.  We really enjoyed our meal and will be back!",

One of my favorite things about this Korean restaurant is that they have private party rooms available (view photos to catch a glimpse inside). It is the perfect way to enjoy a private party dinner! They can accommodate small or large parties! The rooms still provide the fun table top grills and you can cook at your table if desired! These private rooms are ideal for business meetings, birthday parties, family gatherings, bachelor party, you name it and it could work! Such a fun idea and concept!  Also, our server Lydia was amazing and so knowledgeable on the menu! She helped us have an amazing experience!",

The restaurant is clean, well decorated with friendly and helpful staff. I've seen a few comments about the servers not knowing about the menu, but  the times I've visited, they've offered suggestions and answered questions. In addition, other servers will help as you need and are very accommodating.  I was surprised when I got a lunch special (I had the bibimap and my friend had the dol-sat bibimap) and we were presented with soup and the sides. I didn't realize that a lunch special would include sides and it was very happy about that because the sides are amazing and one of the perks of Korean food. Our server even brought us more sweet potatoes because they were so good.  Both of our dishes were amazing. The flavors are just perfect in their dishes. Honestly, a few days after my visit, I was craving it again. This is going to be my weekly lunch place.  As far as cost, yes, the lunch special was $11. However, it's a LOT of food. That one lunch gave me two more days of leftovers. For me, the quality of the food is definitely worth it.  And if you can't handle chopsticks (c'mon, give it a try), just request a fork. ;)",

When we walked in they didn't have a table available so we decided to head to the bar and grab a drink while we waited. The bartender that evening turned out to be one of the owners, who absolutely made our experience amazing. He mixed us drinks per our own tastes and then even invented a drink for us to try later on.  The food was delicious and authentic to our experiences in Korea. Lots of delicious varieties of pickled sides, hard to find here in Phoenix. If you haven't had the experience of True Korean BBQ before, this is a great place to start. The staff will walk you through everything. We had a very memorable night and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I have tried the sushi and the ribeye and chicken BBQ here and all of it was quite good. The service was also impeccable and the setting is very nice and clean. It is definitely a pricey place. For two adults and a kid, we ended up spending $100 and we didn't even order drinks. They also don't have a kid friendly menu at all. Luckily, my 6 yo will eat rice and liked the chicken, so she shared with us. It is definitely an authentic place. Most of the \"sides\" I wasn't too crazy about and it was a bit overwhelming. You get 16 small dishes of them! To be honest, I had no idea what most of them were. I did try almost all of them and a couple of them were good. Not sure how often I will go back, but it was a very cool experience.",

The restaurant is clean, updated, and a lot bigger than I thought it would be (insert a Dr Who 'it's bigger on the inside clip'). However, like all kbbq places, it is pricey. We ordered the combination D which is $139.99 before tax and tip. However, the amount of food and the quality of meat are worth it. Every meat we ordered was amazing quality- very tender and flavorful. The marinades didn't overpower the taste of the meat like at some places. They'll even cook the meat for you or help you if you ask. The portions were decent too. The meal doesn't stop there though! We also had a crazy amount of banchan, soup (2 options), rice, scallion pancake, shumai, and lettuce to make wraps. They also gave us sesame oil and an amazing ginger dressing to dip meat in. I was very fat and happy by the time we finished dinner. However, there were a couple of hiccups during our meal. I chalk it up to an inexperienced waiter or maybe too many things to remember to bring to the table? Whatever the reason, our meat was brought out but the sides had been forgotten. We were quickly brought the banchan- my favorites were the potato salad and the pickled veggies. However, we had to ask again for rice, another time for our soup, and different time for any sauces (we originally asked for a dressing for the salad since it was just plain shredded lettuce and carrots in a bowl). Even though service wasn't smooth, it was quickly fixed by either our waiter or the owner. Both were incredibly quick to bring us any refills we asked for or anything we were missing. The owner was amazingly nice and respectful and that by itself earned a star from me.",

They have a great variety of meats to choose from. Personally, I wouldn't get appetizers bc the meat will fill you up along with all of the sides you get! The serve situation is very traditional korean restaurant style. We only saw our original server when he took our food order and when he gave us our check. All of the servers work together and make sure everyone is okay but never the less just use the bell that's next to your table if needed! It comes in helpful. They also turn on the grill for you- I don't have a gas grill so I'm unaware of how to use one but it's great! I'd recommend this place to everyone!",

Naturally, one would replace that but he never brought out more. Why wouldn't you replace the meat YOU DROPPED?? I had to ask two different people four different times for a straw, dirty dishes didn't get cleared, and overall the service just sucked.

You do get a lot of food when ordering combos, ours came with 2 sides, and rice for everyone. My co-workers and I, had the combo that was enough for 3-4 people. We order LA Galbi (marinated short rib on bone), Bulgogi (marinated rib eye), and Dak Bulgogi (marinated chicken spicy. The combo came with a Hot Pot which was cooked egg broth, and the Yachae Jeon(a veggie pancake). We were then able to pick two appetizers with this combo , we chose Jalapeno Bombers and Edamame. Other Korean BBQ places usually have 4-5 sides of different kimchi or pickled veggies. Here they give you over 8 different ones and explain each one, which is awesome if it's your first time. For fountain drinks they have coke products. They also have tea that isn't sweetened, but you can also add flavors to it like raspberry. Even had boba! The staff was super attentive and really helpful. Again the set up was great for all group sizes, but even better if you have a group of 6+. Highly recommend for birthdays or just a night out.",

    "text": "Excellent Korean Food!  I often drive North on I-17 and see their sign \"coming soon\". Finally after a couple of months they have opened. My wife and I tried this place for the first time yesterday. Although we are a takeout kind of couple I was impressed when we walked into the restaurant. Very clean. The decor provides an appealing display of their Korean heritage. Conservative, but beautiful. I was greeted promptly and (I should have got her name. but I think she is part-owner) an eagerness to answer any questions. My wife and I are Korean food veterans.  There are few Korean restaurants in Phoenix. We have tried most of them. This is by far the best. What we ordered: Lunch portions Mandu - Excellent. Not from a freezer. LARGE. One order would be enough for a good meal.  Shumai - Also made from scratch. Very tasty.  Beef bulgogi - haven't had this combination of flavors for so long. Wonderful marinade to go along with a nice char taste. The beef is lean and the serving is generous.  Spicy chicken - Oh my (). You better like heat and have rice nearby to take away the initial sting. I didn't expect it would be that hot. Although I really enjoyed this dish. Again, very nice portion.  Dinner portions  Kimchi-jiige - Very spicy. Excellent flavored soup. Lots of vegetables.  Chapchae - Over-the-top! Very authentic. If my wife says it's good food. It's good.  The different side dishes provided were kimchee and various pickled or preserved vegetables. Not frozen. Not prepacked. Presented beautifully.  I will be going back.",

In case you don't know...Seoul BBQ & Sushi is a large Korean Restaurant that offers a Large Korean Menu with Korean BBQ Combos. This is an attractive nice looking restaurant.  We enjoyed ourselves so much last time we couldn't wait to come back again soon to try the BBQ Combo.   Last time they started us off with 17 DELICIOUS side dishes and told us what they were. This was so GREAT last time...These were the BEST side dishes I ever had at a Korean Restaurant!  This time we were served 8 side dishes that didn't seem as flavorful or fresh and nobody told us what they were. I saw one side dish that was different and asked what it was and I was told it was a root. My husband tried it and told me it was a very fishy fish.... ;(   Next we were served a salad that was slightly BROWN    :(  Then our Bulgogi comes out and is being cooked for us. The meat was very tasty and was made with a delicious marinade but didn't get any caramelization....It came out sort of braised.  The Rib was prepared a little better and did get a little caramelization. It didn't seem like the best quality because it was a little chewy with some gristle.  Last time our plates were cleared.  This time we just looked a big pile of dirty plates.  I will be generous  with the rating since they are new and still working things out.  This restaurant really has SO MUCH POTENTIAL! I really enjoyed everything so much on my first visit!  I hope to enjoy the menu again!",

Restaurant was less than 1/3 full. Seated and had 3 different persons ask us what we wanted to drink. Push drinks cause you make over 100% on profit. Try water with lemon and add sugar to hold you over and not have to pay over $2+ for ice tea and $4-5 for draft. The good part, large selection. The bad part, the prices are too high. Food was average, found nothing special in taste. Had 4 different items and dinners and everyone agree, too expensive.  Dinners are $34-$39 dollars. I have been to other locations in the valley that offer the same menu at a lot less $$$. Will I return, don't think so.",

Meal came from bunch of appetizers, which includes all Korean side dishes, vegetable pancake, shumai l, a choice of soup from a list and salad. As for meat it comes with Kalbi and a choice of meat from a list. We chose bulkogi.  Remember, it supposed to be a MEAL FOR TWO. NOT AT ALL! It's meal for 4 for sure!! You will get tons of food! Everything tasted yummy! Service was great too but I didn't like server cooked meat for us. We would rather do it by ourselves. And server shut the grill off quickly... We even wondered if they were trying to save on gas. lol We wish we had more control.  Overall, good food and good service. But not cheap. I don't like spicy at all. I wish I was able to choose non spicy soup. I had macaroon ice steam, which was ok. Macaroon was so sweet so I did not taste ice cream well. Including tip, we paid almost $100. Would we come back? Definitely! But next time with more people.",

    "text": "If you enjoy Korean food you need to come here!  This was our first time, but I was so impressed with the experience I wanted  to yelp about them!  We were driving down from Flagstaff to Sky Harbor and in the mood for ramen, but all the Japanese places were closed (for July 4th).  Looking through Yelp my attention immediately went to their hot pots and stews.  So we decided to have Korean instead and so glad we did!  I was impressed with the obvious care taken to the surroundings, service and food.  The restaurant is spacious, modern, and clean.  You tap the service button at your table when you're ready to order.  Our server was polite and efficient and brought out the banchan shortly after we ordered.  There were 16 dishes -- I think I squealed when he kept laying down dish after dish! For two people that is an impressive number of banchan!  They even had soy braised eggs which I never see outside of Taiwanese places!  What was notable to my husband and I though was the different layers of spice and flavors in their kimchee.  We've had plenty of kimchi where all you taste is the heat and nothing else or just the acid, but their kimchee (today cabbage, radish, two types of cucumbers and baby bok choy) all tasted unique and balanced with varying levels of heat.  I generally don't tolerate a ton of spice and some of their kimchee was fairly spicy, but it was a controlled, enjoyable heat. Fantastic!  My husband ordered the kimchee jjigae and I had the soon tofu combo.  My dish could be ordered mild, spicy or \"white seasoning\" (no spice at all).  I decided no spice because I wanted to taste the underlying flavors and I've been disappointed in places where mild=too spicy.  This dish is delicious comfort food at its best with the silkiest homemade tofu in a rich, complex flavored broth mingled with a poached egg, nappa, mussels, clams, and shrimp bubbling in a hot pot and so good I could eat it everyday.  I was so stuffed after this and the rice and the banchan, but I kept eating because everything tasted sooo good.  We will definitely be coming back!  They also have sushi and of course Korean bbq which I can't wait to try.",

I got told that the meal that you would pay $140 for would come with 8 meats no less then 16oz of serving per meat so that's over 8lbs seems like more then enough. But turns out to be wrong you only get 5 meats. Also if they mess up and not bring out the rice you'll get told very nicely that rice is complimentary that you dont get charged for the rice. If that was the case then rice would be all you can eat not get charged extra for extra rice like the menu says. Honestly we had to guess what the 14 side dishes where and wait to for a server to ask. I had 3 kids with me 2 under the age of 3 and 1 that is 7 and they get included as guest so they made sure they take 18% gratuity so I ended paying $321 for 8 people that included a $45 gratuity. Idk will have to reconsider visiting this place again or go elsewhere. But to the cooks of all my extra stuff like the veggie pancake and sushi and my appetizers thank you cause everything was enjoyable thanks to y'all.",

Again this is a new restaurant where their service staffs still need to get trained (some of them are new). They are friendly though.  Price of dishes that I ordered (BBQ for 5 to 6 people, seafood pancake and more) are pricier and small quantity (particularly BBQ).   There are other Korean restaurants who provide similar or better taste of authentic Korean dishes with a reasonable price in Phoenix and Mesa area. It happened to my friend who took her friends to this restaurant and got surprised by the price.   Parking: Free and plenty of spaces Service: Friendly but need to improve Price: High for what they provide compare other Korean restaurants in this area Recommendation: Try Jjangbong (Spicy seafood noodle soup)",

The dinner comes with \"14 sides\" that they would not tell you what they were till they arrived, all of which looked inedible. Once they described the \"sides\" they then sounded inedible. The meat that arrived looked rancid, and once cooking started smelled rancid. The rice that arrived in a tiny bowl, was marked as an extra cost if you wanted more.... more PLAIN WHITE RICE was extra!!   Once the first round of meat was cooked the flavor was ok, but I would have expected fantastic for the price. I will not be back.",

We sat at the bar that was tended by the owner, who was gracious, kind, and incredibly friendly--a real asset to the community. The menu is extensive, but we were strictly looking for Korean food on this visit. My wife had been stationed in Korea, and had not been able to find her favorite dish since she'd gotten back years ago. This place had it! Dokbokki and Goon Man-Du appetizers filled us up, but I wished I'd ordered another dish to take home. We will definitely be back, the restaurant is very nice, good ambience, attentive staff, any kind of authentic Asian food you could want, and very accommodating. They even have Japanese, Chinese, and Korean beer!",

The rice of the sushi was falling apart before it got to the table and all the fish looked squished and not fresh (the fish had a very dull color) Thats the even the worst part of this experience. The bulgogi we ordered came out on a \"sizzling\" plate but the meat was completely cold and I mean COLD! The server brought this cold bulgogi back to the kitchen and said they will make a fresh bulgogi for us. 15 mins later they brought us a plate of OBVIOUSLY spicy marinaded CHICKEN and told us that is the beef bulgogi. The audacity of this place... 10/10 would NOT recommend.",

I'm so glad we went here, the food was great (just read the other reviews here!) and the service was great too- I have to applaud the young gentlemen in training (I forget his name but I think he was the manager's son) for handling all our requests, letting us know what all the dishes were and even grilling all the meat for us! -Normally when I've been to Korean BBQ houses, they start it off and then leave, but our waiter was so attentive and switched out the pan right when the first round of meat was done.  Oh and the shaved ice-cream deserts - :0! I've never had it that style before. Usually the base is plain shaved ice but this place mixes it with condensed milk so it's like a fine, light ice cream with toppings. I can't wait to have it again!",

The best we've tasted around. They have some really unique dishes, that i haven't seen around the Phoenix area. This place would have gotten a five star, if they would have boxed out meal for us. It was kind of difficult for us to box soup and ensure our son was turning in the gas grill at the table.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",

I had the JJamppong that was packed with a bounty of seafood delights in the most wonderful broth and my husband had the Samgyettag. Both were absolutely delicious and served with at least a dozen traditional Korean side dishes that were so yummy! The service was great, friendly and prompt.

And I even told the person who seated us that we there for the BBQ. The pre-cooked BBQ plates came with 8 sides dishes, and we also ordered a plate of fried shiumai as an appetizer.  Everything tasted fine but portions were quite dinky, and the $2 charge for extra orders of rice or sides seems highly unreasonable.  Our bill came to $34 with tax+tip (without beverages), and I was hungry again a few hours later.  Overall just mediocre value for the money here so probably no return trip anytime soon.",
