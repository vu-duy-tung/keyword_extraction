I honestly do not understand the appeal. If you have ever been to a place like Wagamama, you know there is a right way and a wrong way to do a noodle soup restaurant. This is the wrong way. First, every single soup I have ordered there (and I've been more than 3 times) tasted the same. I could not remember what I had the times before I went, they were that unmemorable. The misconception that this place is healthy also is kind humorous to me. I'm sure I'm getting my weekly value of sodium every time I go there.   I do have to mention, however, how great their squid salad, kimchee, and other small plates are. Whether they are from a jar or pre-prepared is another story, but regardless, they are good. The boba tea seems to be the thing to get here if you're not into ramen or just passing through. I'm not a connoisseur of boba teas so I will not pretend I know what I'm talking about with that, albeit I'm sure it's good.",

Two weeks later and I'm not sure if it's a flu or allergies. Either way, my congested sinuses left me sounding a little like Elmer Fudd. Enter Asian Bob and his spicy remedy to clear out the last of this seasonal sickness.  I hadn't heard of Republic Ramen + Noodles located next to the Phoenix Rock Gym on Dorsey & University. I was surprised at the mod and clean layout - a far cry from the pizza place that used to be here. The staff knew exactly what I needed and soon a huge bowl of ramen was sitting in front of me.  I loved that it was full of spicy broth. It wasn't the hottest thing I've ever eaten, but over the next 12 hours it worked its magic. The next morning I woke up with a clear head and normal voice.  Thanks Republic Ramen!",

    "text": "If you're trying to decide on a place for ramen, and you've ever dined at Ippudo, Naruto, Minca, or Totto in NYC and thought they had good to fantastic ramen, you will NOT like Republic.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with pork (you get a choice of meat) and an egg, and a lychee green tea with boba. The ramen was not complex at all, and really just tasted like salt. And the noodles looked and felt and tasted packaged, sooo not worth the calories tasty at all! The pork was tough and chewy and not tender at all, and there were so many fatty bits that were inedible that I wish I had opted for tofu. I liked the spinach, which was out of place but flavorful.  The bubble tea was AWFUL for the first few sips, which alternated between bitter and chemical-sweet, but after I let it sit for 15 minutes it was better. The boba were a little too hard/dry on the inside, but it was towards the end of the day so maybe they were just sitting around for a while? Considering how hard it is to find boba around this town, I'm not complaining-I would go back and try another flavor, but I wouldn't have high expectations.  Look, if you want soup with noodles, this place will do. But if you want RAMEN, with rich, complex broth that isn't overly salty, with tender pork and handmade noodles, I would skip this place. With enough hot sauce, it was definitely edible, but it wasn't what I was craving (since I was craving ramen)...and so I am disappointed.",

    "text": "First, a public service announcement...  TONKOTSU = Pork bone. Broth that is used as a ramen soup base. TONKATSU = Pork cutlet (breaded in panko). Something you eat over rice.  Thank you. We now return to our regular opinionated review...     So you just saw Tanpopo or Ramen Girl and wanted to try some ramen from a place that specializes in ramen to see what all the fuss was really about. You come into this place, order a bowl of miso ramen and patiently await your meal. When the girl brings your ramen you close your eyes and imagine yourself in some quaint ramen shop somewhere in Japan - bullet train in the distance,  enka playing from the shop's speakers. You put the ramen broth to your lips and....  PPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!  almost spit it all back into the bowl. Instantly you're back in Tempe - light rail in the distance, alternative rock blasting from the speakers. The broth has not a molecule of miso flavor that your tongue can detect. Hell, Maruchan and Top Ramen have more flavor in their \"flavor packets\" than this sorry excuse for a broth.    Anyway, that's sorta what happened to me more or less. Came in  with rather high expectations and had them shattered the moment I tasted the broth. Umm... did I order the Shoyu Ramen by accident I wondered? If so, MISO SILLY! If I did, though, there should be  a stronger shoyu flavor. The noodles themselves tasted ok. There  were some slices of char siu and they were passable - meaning they  actually had a flavor that resembles char siu. But still, this   place wouldn't even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of Tokyo. Reading some of the other reviews, however, I guess it can cut it  in a strip mall in Tempe on the south side of East University Drive.       I'd actually been here once before a while back and don't even remember what I ordered - it was that good. So I came back a second time just to make sure.  Fool Me Once, Shame On You. Fool Me Twice, MISO STUPID!    So I'm still hoping for a real ramen place to open up in the valley someday. Yeah, sure, some Japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu.  I mean an actual ramen shop that just serves ramen. Maybe yakisoba and  udon as well but primarily ramen. One can dream, right?",

I was floored by the how many choices they offered in Ramen, most shops just have 3-4 options and absolutely nothing other than pork for the protein. I had the vegetarian Ramen with tofu and it was good- lots of delicious and fresh veggies- purple cabbage, chopped scallions, carrots, bean sprouts, and spinach. They have a tupperware of those wonderful red spices (I'm really not sure what they are but I love adding them to my Ramen) by the soda machine in the main dining area. Adding that to the Ramen you're able to control how much spice and how hot you want your noodles.  I am also very impressed by the beverage selection. They carry both Ashai and Ashai Black, a harder to find dark beer by Ashai, a Japanese brewery. Also they have OB a nice light Korean beer (technically a pale ale). I also sampled a boba tea for desert, their Taro is not the best I have had but it was still pretty darn good. All in all this was a solidly 4-star experience.",

    "text": "I can't get enough of this place. My boyfriend and I used to happily make the trek all the way from North Phoenix on a regular basis and have never been let down!  Whenever I go out to eat in Tempe, specifically close to ASU, I expect half-ass service. I expect there to be hungover waitresses and hostesses texting when I walk up because in the past that's what I've come across. Though there are college students working at Republic Ramen, they have always been extremely helpful and have given us fantastic customer service despite the fact sometimes there's only one cashier/server at a time (usually during work hours on weekdays).  What do I love most about the food at Repulic Ramen? The variety. There are several broth choices and they are happy to switch meat out for tofu. And the bowls are packed with tons of fresh veggies. I've seen a couple of complaints on here about the broth being bland - but I've never personally had that issue. Then again, I had a sh*t ton of Sriracha because it makes already phenomenal food taste THAT much better. Anyway, the bowls are huge. My boyfriend and I share one every time. And just in case we're hungrier than we thought, we always order a side of edamame or veggie tempura (if you go during happy hour it's like $1).  But my favorite FAVORITE part of RR is their boba. On the other side of the dining room is a little cafe where they serve boba, sake, coffee, etc. I've lived in North Phoenix and now I live near Central Phoenix and boba is pretty hard to come by in those parts. I'd have to drive to Chandler or the West Valley and that just won't ever happen. I almost always order thai tea milk tea w/ boba but sometimes venture out and get a peanut butter & chocolate snow (creamy slushy) and my boyfriend likes to mix fruity flavors - they have a lot of options and you can mix any of them. Their boba pearls are always soft and they are generous with the amount they put in. I don't know about you, but I hate when I eat all the boba before I'm finished with the liquid. In this case, sometimes I find myself just eating boba pearls because I've already drank all the tea.  All in all, this is probably my favorite restaurant. Does it feel like you're sitting down somewhere in Japan? No. It's definitely Tempe. It's very open and modern. But who cares because it's delicious. Fantastic food, friendly staff, clean bathrooms/tables/everything, lots of seating, and of course, boba!",

When I first learned that there was a ramen place opening up, I thought to myself that there was the potential for a great experience.  The idea of this place is nice, but the execution is lacking.  I ordered the Republic Ramen + Gyoza combo, with the extremely spicy option, no additions, I wanted to try their base specialty.  The gyoza was alright, it was a little too greasy when I got it, but I much prefer fried gyoza to steamed, so that was a plus.  Unfortunately, this gyoza was mixed, meat and veggies, and I wasn't prepared for that.  Generally, I prefer pork gyoza, although I know some people who prefer veggie gyoza.  The combination didn't work too well because there wasn't quite enough meat, and the veggies were a little too rubbery for my taste.  Individually, components were good, I could tell the vegetables were fresh; the green onion had the taste of raw green onion, the bean sprouts were crisp, the spinach hadn't the time to wilt. and the naruto slice tasted of fish, and not of bland texture.  What I found lacking, however, was that the broth was overly salty and lacking it's own depth of flavor, it was also not hot enough, and the pork was very overcooked - I'm not just saying that, either, the pork was brown.  As a matter of taste, I would have preferred they use japanese spinach or nori in the ramen, and for the broth to have been piping hot, still bubbling even.  All in all, it was nothing spectacular, with lots of room to improve.  For the price, though, it was a decent meal.",

Granted I've only eaten here once but the pork was pretty thin....and I didnt hear anything about an egg. But i\"m not ging to hold that against them. They have a great location, a clean shop, and a tasty menu. Will definitely be back as soon as I can convince my work lunch buddy to take me there :)",

Listen, I'm all for the underdog but to cut corners and inflate prices will do nothing but hurt business in the long run. On my particular visit, they were out of pork and chicken. Really? Out of pork at a ramen house? So we opt for the spam and beef. The beef I kid you not was 3 slices of deli roast beef. I AM DEAD SERIOUS! What kind of place are you running here? I mean I understand eclectic is good at times but roast beef in ramen? The noodles were Zeppelinly overcooked and then there's the heavily MSG fortified Tonkotsu and \"Republic\" soup that lacked any depth or long simmered flavor but sufficed in the dry soup packet flavor and an induction of food coma the makers of Ambien would show devout interest in. Overall, there's an aberrant discontinuity of flavors here at this establishment and I was unimpressed and unmotivated to come again. Either cut your prices (after all you're in college-town) or pack up your soup packets and take it elsewhere.",

Very few restaurants are willing to really make a dish spicy. I typically order this way at Thai restaurants and only 1 out of 5 of my favorite places has produced a dish that needed no extra spice. Republic ramen came through in the spice department. The tofu was not too squishy or soggy - just right and the veggies were not over cooked.  My bf had the Shoyu Ramen - original style - great flavor - no extra spice. We also had the seaweed salad which was also one of the best we've had. The seaweed flavor was not too strong. Finally, we had boba tea's - traditional black tea flavor. They were good, the flavor/consistency was not the best we've had - seemed a bit watered down, but would probably still stop by and grab one if we were in the area.",

I checked the menu online and was unsure if I would even like it (Only ever had .10 ramen) I don't ever leave reviews but I was slightly surprised this place didn't have more positive feedback. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which the cashier recommended it was pretty good  but the noodles were slightly overlooked. Loved the portions size tho! I do think they should put less broth, the noodle to broth ratio is off. Like the other reviewer wrote, I too thought it was weird there was a tip option for the workers BUT while waiting for my food I realized just how much the cashier does! They were all over the place doing so many things it was hard to even get a container for the rest of my ramen. I probably noticed all this since I've mostly worked in restaurants most my life and know how hectic it can be. Anyways, pretty good ramen! Will definitely be back again.",

The biggest serving I've ever had in regards to soup. I ordered the miso soup with tofu because I wasn't feeling too adventurous flavor wise. The soup is mostly broth in comparison to veggies, noodles, and protein selection (but keep in mind the size of the bowl). Seaweed salad was put together in a way I've never seen before. It was very artistic. Usually I've only ever seen it just as the seaweed alone. Very cool. I appreciated that they served forks for those of us who are chop stick challenged when it comes to soup and noodles. Will be back!",

My first encounter with ramen outside of a cup of noodles was in san francisco at Ajisen Ramen, that place spoiled me and helped me set a standard. Ever since then Ive had ramen regularly in san diego and las vegas and once in New York, all good, however only two are worthy #2s after Ajisen's Tonkotsu ramen and they are Tajima in San Diego and Republic Ramen in Tempe.  I ordered a Tonkotsu broth with pork and traditional topings, although they got my toppings wrong and gave me original Republic Ramen toppings which were scallions, spinach and carrots, but you know what? It was still reaaaally good. I asked for a medium spice to the broth and it made my nose a lil' runny, which I love ... perfect spice, and also a soy sauce cured egg, which I was hoping was soft boiled but was hard boiled, again, it didnt detract from the experience.  In conclusion this place is legit and has above standard ramen, unlike Cherry Blossom Cafe or Culinary Drop Out and Clever Koi which are all wanna bes compared to Republic Ramen. This place is Legit! I will be driving from Metro PHX to Tempe at least twice a month to this place.",

Now the Tonkotsu and the Republic Ramen are still okay, but not amazing like they once were. The boba and Sno actually are pretty good so there's that but they don't seem proud of it. There is a whole other side of the restaurant dedicated to boba and Sno but it is never really brought to light. In fact, this side seems to be where the employees keep their backpacks, open laptops, and food/drinks from lunch breaks or whatever.

But, it's a great meal on a cold day, and if it's raining you'll probably catch me here, slurping down a giant bowl of noodles.  The portions are huge so expect to take leftovers home. I always order my ramen \"traditional style,\" meaning the noodles are topped with bamboo shoots, seaweed, naruto (slices of fermented fish - they are white with a pink spiral - TRY THEM!), and scallions. You get your choice of meat, but I always go with tofu because the quality of their chicken isn't very good. I haven't tried the other meats because the tofu is a good fit with all of those traditional toppings. (Honestly, I'm apprehensive to try any other meats after having their chicken a few times. Why bother with the potential of being disappointed when the tofu is delicious?)   Republic Ramen also offers Udon noodle bowls and a few rice plates, but you really can't go wrong with the traditional ramen bowls. I've ordered shrimp tempura and edamame as a side, both of which are a nice supplement to the soup if you're craving something more than broth and noodles. They have a wide variety of boba teas, regular tea, and \"slush\" drinks. They also sell beer and sake but I've never ordered anything alcoholic.   The ambiance of the restaurant is good. Nothing fancy but it certainly isn't a hole in the wall. Sound is average, depending on how many other people are eating there. They've got some super cute Asian art on the walls and it always makes me smile. Lots of seating indoors and outside, so even if it's busy you aren't super close to anyone else. Depending where you sit and how curious you are, you can peek inside the kitchen to see large pots of broth on the stove and the chefs hard at work.  Great value, very rich flavors, and good quality food (minus the meat, like I said...). The service is nothing special, but it certainly isn't terrible. I've never had to wait any longer than 10 minutes to get my food. All of the employees are helpful and friendly, but it isn't a restaurant where you get waited on. My only complaint regarding service is I've seen an employee's son behind the counter before. I understand if you can't afford childcare, but keep him in the back! You don't want me to think that you employ 6-year-old children, right...?",

Otherwise, eating in is great. Only reason I docked a star is that it would be nice if they wouldn't let people clip their nails in a restaurant as not only is that totally disgusting, but I'm pretty sure that's gotta be violating some sort of health code. Love this place anyway.   Oops, also forgot. Sometimes nobody picks up the phone even if you call repeatedly and you'll get their voicemail which is full. Aaaand the chicken was not great at all (I compare it to the likes of the chicken in canned soup but worse and blander) so I always order mine without any meat. Otherwise, still love it.",

Also who puts carrots and spinach in their ramen?? If your Asian and have tried real authentic ramen this is a definite no. I ordered the basic Tonkotsu ramen and it was sub par at best. For meat I got pork and it tasted like it came from a freezer and then was put in a microwave. The only good was I liked the choice on the type of noodle they used. On a side note, the water also tasted like it was unfiltered. Don't waste your time and especially your money. I'm actually disappointed since this place has descent reviews. I'd tell people to try places for themselves but this is a serious pass.",

It also helps that are two kids are still small enough that we can share a bowl with them and everyone is full. Our first visit we had the Tonkastu Ramen with pork and tofu. However on our second we had the Sapporo ramen and vegetable ramen with chicken and tofu, along with edamame and gyoza. Well definitely be back on our next visit to Az.My only reason for giving a 4 star is because our 2nd visit the customer service was terrible!!! I felt like I was bothering the kids behind the counter with my order. Then when our food arrived it was just placed on the table and that was it. Now on our 1st visit the gentleman was a little bit older but was definitely more energetic and sociable!! He was the one who brought out our food and even came back to check on us and how we liked the noodles. Despite the second visit being very lack luster I will be back because we liked the food and the price.",

    "text": "I went to Republic Ramen + Noodles because my friends were hungry. Since I already ate dinner before meeting up, I decided to simply order an edamame and a boba.   I would have given this place two stars for the food. I do not recommend ordering the edamame or the boba here. I usually love sweets, and will leave good reviews for bobas, but I was surprised that I could be turned off so much by the taste of boba here... the boba itself was undercooked and hard, and the almond milk tea tasted saccharine-awful. The edamame was filled with salt - I spent a lot of time wiping off the salt with a napkin. So, why the two stars for the food? I tried some soup of my friend's Tokyo Ramen and the broth was alright. She said that the ramen was salty but okay. If you end up going here, do yourself a favor and just order the ramen.   The reason why I gave this place one star, rather than two, was because of the lackluster service. We waited a very long time for our food (how long does it take to make boba and an edamame?), and when my friend asked where her food was, the server wasn't very helpful. We went in a group of three; one of my friends and I got our orders first (we waited about 30-40 minutes for the food; the edamame and the bobas came out at the same time as the Tokyo Ramen), and my other friend had to wait about an additional 15-20 minutes before her ramen arrived. Also, off-topic but the bathroom seemed unclean.    Although the Tokyo Ramen was okay, there are tons of other restaurants with better food and better service. I will not return, and I do not recommend this place.",

    "text": "Went there after living in Tokyo for 5 years. I wasn't expecting Japan-grade ramen but I was hoping that it would be OK. The ramen was a step up from cup ramen. I got the tonkotsu ramen with traditional toppings and egg. It was not tonkotsu at all. The taste was weak and salty. I might as well have gotten salt flavor because that's what I got. The egg was over cooked with a black ring and just crumbled when I tried to eat it.   After I bought some of their boba. I ordered the almond milk tea and it was sticking sweet. Almost tasted like banana milk with a odd after taste, but I could have drank it if it wasn't for the boba itself. It was hard, like I expected the center to be dry it was so hard. It is the worst boba in AZ. Do not waste your money!",

    "text": "Another ramen joint trying to capitalize on the uber popular ramen craze. This place screams, \"We're in the business to make money, not food!\" The interior looks like a cobbled up mess, at least the boba serving side did. Speaking of which, why is this place attached to a boba store?   The ramen here is mediocre at best. I have had much better ramen both in the East Coast (Ippudo, Totto, etc.) and the West Coast (Daikokuya, etc.) within the same price range. The tonkotsu ramen, which apparently is there best seller, did not have any depth in the broth. The noodles were bloated/somewhat soggy and there additional sides were just awful (ex. What should have been menma (fermented bamboo shoots) was just plain hard bamboo cut up). Lets not forget the char siu, which I guess to them is non-roasted thinly sliced pork similarly used in Korean bbq.   In summary, yes this place is better than your $.10-$.25 bag of ramen, but $7-$8? I don't think so. I only came here since I frequent AZ for business and it was a chilly day which in turn made me crave something soupy. As a Japanese American, I searched for the perfect Japanese comfort food to fulfill my soup craving. Unfortunately, all I found was a mediocre noodle joint which Falsely represented the traditional Japanese noodle soup dish.",

I'd been to cherry blossom and didn't like theirs.   I had the Tokyo ramen which they say is a light and spicy tonkotsu ramen with the original toppings. It is lighter than a normal tonkotsu broth but certainly was not spicy at all. But flavor was pretty decent. I liked that the original toppings came with spinach and carrots.  For the price (I think it was $7.50) you got a really good sized bowl.  Bf had the republic ramen which was a pretty spicy one.  He did say that the spiciness builds up.  I didn't think his broth was as flavorful as mine but he still liked it lots. Interestingly my bf didn't eat all his noodles so I got to eat part of his too and his noodles tasted differently.  And it's not bc of the broths so not sure if the noodles are dif.  Place is clean and staff was pretty good. For all those times you can't go to Cali for ramen and having a craving, this is a pretty decent sub.",

Ramen would be the perfect \"sickness\" meal or the perfect \"hangover\" meal. I love that they have chili powder and Sriracha that you can add into your bowl.

I ended up ordering the miso ramen, which a huge mistake.  It was so salty and just had a really weird taste to it.  I couldn't even finish it.  The husband tried the tonkotsu ramen with beef which he enjoyed. Our friend came late and ordered the same thing but the blonde said, \"we're out of beef.\"  So then my friend said, \"is the chicken or charsiu better then?\"  Her answer, \"That's all we have...is chicken or charsiu left.\"  Um. ok.   Though my food experience was not the best, my husband enjoyed his, and I'd like to  come back if we're ever on that side of town again to try the tonkotsu or the udon.  I'm willing to give it another try.  But they need a better hostess at the front because she was absolutely clueless.",

Also ordered the gyoza and they were well cooked and flavorful.  Sauce was nondescript. The service consisted of ordering at the cashier and having our food brought to us.  Both experiences were perfectly fine, and the cashier (Vanessa?) was very friendly. Two others ate with me and they both commented that their ramen was good but they've had better.  I can't remember which ones they ordered but one had a very light broth and the other an almost brown broth.   I must say it was all fresh.  The ingredients were not skimpy and the portion size was big.   A very middle-of-the-road experience. Atmosphere is very open and public with big benches and tables inside, and a small area outside to eat at. If you like ramen, I can't highly recommend this place but I would say you could do much worse.",

Today, I got the chili pepper broth with the original toppings and pork. So the broth is not too oily, it doesn't have the greasy feeling after you drink it. However, the broth wasn't as spicy as I would have liked it. The broth feels like it was one of their other regular broth with some of the green chili pepper minced up for you to mix it in.  The port was thinly slice had a little bit of fat, but overall was cooked well. However it was lacking flavor. It felt more like it was maybe just sliced in boil without any seasoning. Not like the regular pork bellies at other ramen places.  The original toppings consisted of spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, and some other misc.  The ramen noodle was average, not exceptional or anything. But there was a good amount of the ramen in the bowl.  Overall in the entire dish out of a 10 scale rating system is maybe a 6.5.  Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I will try a different type of broth Base.  But would I come here just to eat this, probably not.   Will continue to search for the best ramen in Phoenix.",

It took a good workout though at nearby Phoenix Rock Gym with friends to actually stop and enjoy a fat bowl of ramen afterwards.  Beware if you want to add anything in addition to what is included in the bowl already - it can end up costing you a pretty penny for lots of extras!   Our group made quite a line upon arrival which in turn made our bowls take a bit of time to be delivered [oh well]. I went with my friend's suggestion of Tonkotsu Bowl with pork. Many great flavors, but just it seems not a lot of fixins, waaaay too many noodles in the bowl with the soup to be worthy of the cost. Loved the edamame, because you can't go wrong with edamame. Delicious ramen though and I'd probably return to split a bowl + edamame and some boba next time.",

The staff is friendly but they only need to interact with you for a minute or so when taking your order. There are a number of topping options for 50 cents or a dollar such as extra veggies, meat and noodles in case you want more. Beware of adding toppings because there is little addition and it can make your bill much more than you expect. They also have udon if ramen texture is just not for you. I got the vegetarian ramen but I kept the naruto because seafood is my guilty pleasure. As I was sitting I noticed how spacious the interior was to seat a large number of people. Within few minutes, the order came out which is much appreciated since I am alone and it's awkward waiting for extended periods of time. As I take my first bite I can tell that there is a lot of salt in the broth and there is a thick soy sauce taste. It has a bitter aftertaste as well. The noodles are good but not great they have the texture of noodles that sink in your teeth rather than bounce back which is what I call \"lacking bite.\" I decided to add chili pepper from the area that has the fountain drinks, napkins and utensils, since the broth is otherwise dimensionless.You could come out satisfied by the quantity of food but the quality is just subpar.

    "text": "This is the best Ramen in Phoenix? Next time I'm in town, I'll should stick to burgers, beer, and good 'ol typical American food.  It's my first trip to Phoenix and I don't know where to eat. After running the Rock & Roll half-marathon, I'm driving around STARVING. Looking to somewhere to eat, I pass by Republic Ramen and I think \"Ramen! My favorite!\" And decide to stop in.   Inside, it's set up like a fast food joint: counter, register, and the menu posted high up behind the cashier. After ordering they bring it out to your table.   My bowl of today, and the last one ever here, is the Sapporo bowl - butter corn in Miso soup. It arrived and I think, \"Where's the corn?\" - It was sitting at the bottom of the bowl. Presentation is not a priority here.   My choice of meat was the chicken (which was also hiding) and I went with extra beef. I should've gotten neither. Both were flavorless, I'd even say that they were dry, even after soaking in the broth!  In the end, I've realized there is nothing special about this place but the fact that it must be the town's only ramen to have won that award.   Call me biased or spoiled, because I come from Los Angeles and we have the BEST ramen: full of amazing flavor and comfortable traditional environments. If you're ever in LA and you crave ramen, add me and scroll through my bookmarks.   I wouldve given this place a 1, but the people are nice and they show football on the tvs.",

My favorites are the Tonkotsu Ramen and Chili Pepper Ramen. They are very generous with portions and there's always plenty of meat with my noodles. It's an additional to add extra meat or toppings.They do have other options such as udon and rice. Staff are wonderful and helpful if you need to know something or need them to recommend something delicious. It can be a little dim at night because of the red lights, but I personally love the ambiance.",

I mean I think it's weird when I go to the counter and ask if their tonkatsu ramen comes with chashu that they say it can come with anything and you can mix and match the broths. That's ... not right. Real ramen the broth is an integral component of the dish, you can't just mickey mouse it. Most places I've gotten ramen at in California, you know all the components are thought out and at best you can add an egg and that won't wreck it.  So yeah, they'll make any variation of ramen based on what they have. At best, its better than Cup O' Noodles, I suppose. Honestly, the \"Republic Ramen\" is the only good version and I'm not crazy about soy based ramens, but it's okay.   This place fills a hole since I want ramen, but its like going to Chipotle because you want a burrito. I suppose technically its a burro, but come on, it's not legit. It's good for what it is, but makes me miss real ramen places. And especially real tonkatsu ramen.",

Well, when I left the SF Bay area a while back, the thing I dreaded leaving most was all the amazing privately-owned restaurants and hidden ma-n-pa joints that serve up delicious, authentic food.  Republic Ramen soothed my fear a lil though, since they dish out a pretty tasty bowl of ramen.  In fact, their Shoya ramen is just as good as my regular order back in Cali - butter corn ramen.  (I did have to add corn to it though and would love to see a butter corn option on the Republic menu one day.)      The restaurant is clean, freshly decorated and service was efficient (order and pay at front counter, they bring your food).  Those facts, combined with the fact that the ramen was so good (and they have kimchi sides), give Republic 5 stars!  See ya there!",

    "text": "I really struggle on how many stars to give this place.  On the one hand, there's very, VERY few places to get ramen, saimin, udon, and the like in the Phoenix metro area.  I really appreciate this place as an option!  On the other hand, Republic's ramen is merely fine.  Not amazing, but fine.  It wouldn't pass in Hawaii, but lack of competition here means they'll by default get the business of ramen-cravers like me.  Their broth cannot come close to the savory, complex, authentic ramen I've tried though.  Maybe they're stretching themselves too thin with the bar and dessert/boba options (which I still have no idea how to order).  I'd rather they offer a really solid ramen noodle with either a shio/salt and shoyu/soy broth choice, or even just one absolutely amazing broth.  The \"shrimp purse\" happy hour appetizer was also simply \"fine\" and I wouldn't pay the normal price for it.  It would've been four stars but I am taking one off for their inability to cook an egg properly.  Everyone knows the egg should be either soft and runny to ooze it's rich golden yolk over the noodles, OR be made into a seasoned, rolled japanese omelette (tamagoyaki) and sliced super thin.  NOT hard boiled!  Don't expect a lot of customer service, as they're basically operating as a \"fast casual\" Chipotle-type restaurant.  Some of the tables were not cleared and wiped promptly, despite employees not helping customers.  Count me in as another person who is not a huge fan of the uncomfortable seating  Overall, if I'm in the area and hungry I'll drop by again, but I really don't see myself making a special trip to this side of the valley just to eat here.",

Republic Ramen is not in my neighborhood, but I decided to take the drive to check it out.  First of all, parking was plentiful, and I found a spot with some shade, which is important when it's 109 degrees out. Walking in, there wasn't much in the way of atmosphere, but they had exactly what I wanted on their menu - Original Miso Ramen, which I ordered as is with pork, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions and spinach. You can order additional ingredients, but I wanted to try it with their original preparation the first time. I also ordered Japanese Curry Rice to go to have later for dinner. You order at the register, and they bring your food to your table.   My Miso Ramen came out pretty quickly, and they said they would bring my curry out shortly. My dish looked and smelled appetizing, so I dug in. The miso broth was good, and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. I LOVED the ramen noodles. They were cooked to the texture that I like, slightly chewy, and were delicious with the other ingredients. The serving was so large that by the time I finished all of the solids in the bowl, I couldn't finish the miso broth. They were not stingy with anything in the dish. I will go back for the Ramen again!  I didn't taste the Japanese Curry until I got home. It was still warm, but had an overly oily texture that I didn't care for. It was ok reheated later, but I wouldn't try it again.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other broth flavors for the ramen!",

Thankfully my high expectations were not only met but exceeded when I stumbled upon Republic Ramen. After much though, I decided to order the Shrimp Tempura Udon noodles. After a short wait time, the udon was brought out to me along with the noodles, Naruto, and tempura all packaged in separate containers. I absolutely love it when restaurants take the extra effort to package the foods separately as not to let the food get too soggy too quickly. Albeit there is an environmental concern with all the extra plastic. However, I am here to judge the food, not the restaurant's impact on the world. The broth was full of flavor and warming, exactly what I look for when ordering Udon. The saltiness was perfectly balanced and not overbearing. Onions, scallions, spinach, and seaweed were all fresh and delicious. My only small disappointment was the crunchiness of the tempura, as it was a little soft. This was made up for with the vast tea selection they had available for purchase.  For such great food, the pricing was incredibly reasonable. I ended up paying no more than $11 for a filling, healthy, and extremely flavorful meal. While I have definitely been to cheaper Ramen houses, I could understand the pricing due to Arizona's land locked status. Obviously the shipping cost becomes a factor for any restaurant that wants to serve quality sea food to desert dwellers.  The ambience of the establishment was also very relaxing and welcoming. The rooms are all lit with a soft and dim lighting. Decorations you would expect to find in ramen houses adorn the walls and ceilings. The tables and chairs were all quality made and comfortable to sit on. In addition, there was a seating area for when one was waiting for their food to be cooked (if one was doing take-out instead of dining in).  The atmosphere was inviting. The light smell of ramen and udon broth filled the room, strong enough to make entice one's appetite yet subtle enough to be pleasant. Music also played in the background of the normal restaurant noise. I came at a relatively busy time (in the later afternoon) so I was greeted with a the warm noise of restaurant chatter and conversation. Overall it was a enjoyable area to dine.  Last but certainly not least was the service. I was greeting by a smiling cashier. Since it was my first time at Republic Ramen I asked for the cashier's recommendations. She went above and beyond by explaining her favorite different types of Udon and Ramen. Once I had ordered my food I took a number and then sat down at one of the tables. My food was promptly brought out to me and the runner thanked me for coming and let me know he hoped I enjoyed the food.",

    "text": "Been looking for a good Ramen place since I moved out here from SD and the search will continue. What is sad is that they have potential...the Tonkatsu Base was delicious and the noodles were perfect...it's everywhere else where it fell apart. The proteins were god awful.  I ordered the beef, with Char Siu added and the beef was fatty, unseasoned, and overcooked beyond recognition. They forgot my Char Siu, and since they had charged me 2$ for it I went up to ask for it (politely! mistakes happen, no big) and was argued with. Finally she checks my receipt and sees that I did in fact order/pay for it so she says she'll bring it right over. 5 minutes later... 10 minutes later... 15 minutes later it finally comes, my soup is cold and at this point I'm overall extremely dissatisfied. But maybe I'll have some delicious BBQ pork to turn this failure train around. Nope! Look, I'm not an expert on the subject, but this is what char siu is supposed to look like  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DChar%2BSiu%26rlz%3D1C1CHBF_enUS703US703%26source%3Dlnms%26tbm%3Disch%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0ahUKEwjjsJTNmL3OAhWI7CYKHUHbBrIQ_AUICCgB%26biw%3D2560%26bih%3D1339%23imgrc%3D2EhyTZLYBwU-2M%253A&s=37bed9a2363799715046a03597f439981272e19b0477c2539c380bdf1d3ff989\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">google.com/search?q=Char...</a> Instead I get paper thin sliced, steamed, unseasoned/overcooked mystery meat that was indistinguishable from the beef except for a slight taste of wet blanket. What makes Char Siu, well...Char Siu, is the Char Siu Sauce that it's glazed in before grilling. Unseasoned/Unsauced steamed pork is just not the same thing.  Apparently this is not just limited to the beef and the pork as the Chicken Shoyu Ramen my girlfriend ordered was just as bad. They just boiled the chicken and threw it in the broth. While the broth was flavorful the chicken was dry, overcooked, unseasoned...man, I'm detecting a pattern here.  Look, when there are three protein options, at least get one of them right.   Small nitpicky stuff: The spoons are horrible. Now I know, I sound crazy, but follow me here: When you get ramen or Udon you get a large chinese soup spoon. These are great because they hold a large amount of broth, and serve as a base to catch what drips off your noodles. All they have here are small plastic stirring spoons, like what you use to stir ice tea. These are just not the same, and trying to eat a massive bowl of soup a tea spoon at a time feels like bailing out a boat with a tea cup.   All in all I was extremely disappointed. I guess the hunt for decent ramen continues!",

Friendly service, tasty food, very generous portions, and bright, clean location.

The staff are above average and have never been an issue seeing as they really just take your order at the register and then bring your food out, so there isnt really much to mess up. Its the food. If you cant eat pork, prepare to be disappointed, they have 1 dish, literally 1 dish that ISNT made with pork broth. Its really disheartening, but I didnt dock points for that because whatever im just one person and thats my specific need. I did however dock points because even with the 1 dish that I had, it was extremely...bland. Now the only things with flavor were the added ingredients, but even then I felt like the egg had just the flavor beat out of it along with anything else in the bowl. Its not horrible exactly but it definitely leaves something to be desired. I constantly order the 2/4 piece shrimp tempura and the edamame sides and BOTH of them TASTE LIKE THE RAMEN, in that they dont really taste like much at all!   I mean fuckin' hell how do you remove flavor from shrimp? Why does edamame taste like literally nothing? This place is really a mystery to me.

I've had boba all over the city and while this looked like boba it was the worst.  I ordered almond milk tea and there was a very strong taste to it.  I realize my description will be a little off but the best way i can describe it is super sweet (without the good taste) and it had a kick to it.  It was like the almond was in overdrive. The boba were also hard.  I don't know if they were just under cooked but after a few sips I could not drink anymore of it.   There was nothing satisfying about this drink on a hot day.",

I got the tonkatsu ramen since you can't go wrong with that traditional flavor, and I was pretty satisfied. I also got to try the republic ramen, which was good.. (I preferred the tonkatsu broth for sure though) The noodles and toppings were okay (I got the traditional option - I love menma!!), and the size was very generous (I couldn't finish mine). Overall I'd give the food 3.5/5.   I'd say they're a 4/5 though, just because the food comes out very quickly (I think it took like 5mi for everything to come me out!), it's very convenient, and the service is great! :)  While I've definitely had better ramen in Phoenix, you can't beat the convenience and speed!! It's worth coming here if you're hungry and looking for a fast ramen option :)",

Good size bowl of Ramen with average amount of condiments added to the bowl.  The Original Broth is good a little on the salty side. To me, one of the most important factors in Ramen is how good the broth soup base is, any restaurant can add as many high end condiments but if the soup base is to hot or not a smooth tasting or appeasing for me, you have automatically lost me.  Ordered the Ramen with original broth with Tonkatsu, like I mentioned the soup base was on the salty side, but not bad, other than that the bowl had had average amount of other items.  Overall I would say it is one of the better Ramen places in town but still searching for that go to Ramen House in town.  In my opinion, this place caters very much to the younger crowd mainly students from nearby ASU, so they will not be as particular as myself",

    "text": "My son was dying to try a ramen noodle soup from this place.  He opted for Republic Ramen with pork--it is one of the spicy ones.  It comes with spinach and a bunch of other veggies.  I opted for an order of pork gyoza.   The bowl was large containing a large amount of a soy sauce based broth.  It had one slice of pork.  He seemed to enjoy the ramen but left most of the broth.  I had an opportunity to taste the broth and it was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  The gyoza, on the other hand, were super delicious--gingery, garlicky and porky. The dipping sauce was super salty.  The place was dimly lit with a reddish lighting that gave a calmness to the place.  I saw lots of students eating their bowls of soups so I take it that this is an ASU hangout.   I personally would not make a special trip to eat here again although the soup was not terrible.  It's just that there are other places that probably will offer a better soup for a better value.",

The only thing I wish they would improve is the quality of meat. Usually I get my ramen without it just because it's kind of meh. My ramen and apps always come out steaming too which I love.",

    "text": "This place should be called Rockn Ramen because the music is straight up green day & the ramen is Rockn. It is near the university so I shoulda known it was going to be collagy. But you shouldn't really listen to me about ramen bcus I've had it like twice in my life & the first time the food was scary so I didn't eat it. But I love me some soup and this ramen was SUPER. Even in this 106 heat it still was tasty.   We came during happy hour & got gyoza & these shrimp purses for a $1 off, I ate like a million of these things. They were perfectly cooked on the crispier side vs dumpling or dim sum way. I got the Tokyo ramen which is a lil bitty hot, not what you think it is and I shared it w/my Tia cuz it was huge. You also get a choice of original or traditional toppings. Not sure what's the difference but I added egg, garlic, corn per suggestion by my sister & that was the way to do it.  Also add some siracha & sesame oil and bam you good!  We also shared the curry rice as a family & ummm not so much. It was a bit thick & no flavor, very floury...yuck! But who goes to ramen & gets curry, no go. We got boba, of course, which I'm not a fan of cuz I can't drink milk & I also feel those Tapioca balls are going to get lodged in my throat accidentally. Everybody else loves it so I support them plus these are my favorite straws so I get sad when I can't have one.   It was a good family time, enjoyed my first good ramen....happy! The one thing I did find telling was there were no Asians of any kind there, except the ones we brought so hhhhmmmmmm!",

Both of us had not been feeling well lately, and he suggested we come here to self medicate and that the food was awesome.  I loved it!    I really like how this place is decorated.  It feels comfortable, with benches and chairs, plenty of seating and a fair amount of room to move in.  No blasting music, very relaxing, but it feels clean and nice.  Anyways, I have never been here before, so in between my friend and the girl behind the counter, I was able to figure out what it was I wanted.  They have a ton of options, from meatless dishes, to stuff with chicken, pork, and even alcohol options to drink as well.   I went with a vegetable clear broth with chicken chunks, and my friend ordered a vegatarian thing since he doesn't eat meat.  They answered all my questions and gave me a lot of options to choose from.  Staff here is patient, and seems to not only know their menu, but take the time to answer questions to make sure your happy with what you order.  The food came out in a HUGE bowl.  It's like eating a hearty bowl of soup, with tons of good stuff in it.  I got through about half, and was STUFFED.  my friend ate about three quarters, and was stuffed as well.  We both have leftovers!  Total bill with drinks was about $20.  love it! I can eat a hearty meal, with left overs and not break the bank!  Will be back in the future, weather its just for dinner, or drinks as well.  Go here and try this place!",

Minus a few stars for the ordering process (for some reason it took forever and the cashier seemed to be confused), the boba (just not as delicious as I'm used to), and the fact that the beef was in one massive strip that was way too big to eat in one bite, but too tough to easily break up.  Will definitely be coming back for the ramen!",

I only eat here because there are very few ramen places in the phoenix area and my friends like ramen. The flavor, texture of the noodles, and warmth of the broth is really not there and that is what ramen is supposed to be about! However, I must commend them on their large portion sizes because they do give you a really big bowl.  This place isn't going anywhere because ASU is nearby.  If you have to HAVE ramen and don't want to drive, then fine, get it here. But there are definitely other options that are better in the valley.",

Their boba drinks here are awesome and I'd come here just to get that if I was craving boba.  While I wish their ramen was better, I'd probably still come back here again if I was craving Ramen since it is so close to campus.",

Just shut up and get the tonkatsu traditional style or else you'll get spinach and carrots in your ramen and wonder what went wrong in your life. Kimchi and seaweed salad were actually pretty good, too, and this is coming from a girl raised on her granny's homemade kimchi. Prices ranged about 8-9 bucks per ramen. The cashier had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about the egg ($1 extra but worth it if it's the ooey gooey-just-cooked-ebough good stuff). I was sad when it came out hardboiled, but flavor was still good (marinated in soy sauce). Definitely go here if the wait at a certain ayce kbbq joint around the corner has a two hour wait for three people, or if you're craving some great ramen.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch on a Sunday and I was pleased with the food. I didn't feel that the broth was watered down or lacked flavor and thought it was very good. I ordered the vegetarian with rice noodles as it's the only way to make it vegan. The regular ramen noodles have egg in them, which is sad but to be expected. The rice noodles didn't have much flavor, but again, that's to be expected. The portions here are rather large, which is nice...makes you feel like you're getting a good bang for your buck. My soup came loaded with bean sprouts, spinach, red cabbage, carrots, and tofu. I added some chili oil and some ground chili pepper they have in a little shaker, which gave it a really good flavor, not too salty, which I was afraid of.   The staff was very nice and helpful...I wish I got the girls name who helped us...but she was awesome!   The only thing that kind of turned me off about this place was the amount of dust. Looking around I could see about three inches of dust on the fans and on the air vents above. The ceiling is painted black as are the fans, which shows every speck of dust...they really need to bust out a vacuum and take care of that because it's a bit off putting. I know previous reviews have commented about this yet it appears to go unchanged. I would also recommend upgrading the iced tea to be in stainless steel dispensers as the plastic we through ones discolor after awhile and start to look dirty even if they're not.   I hope they take my comments about the dust seriously because I want to go back here.",

There was just too much dust up on the AC ducts. Dare I say some spots looked caked with dust, even the fans.. Just imagining all that being blown down into the dinning area almost changed my decision about eating there, but I was too hungry and I had to eat something. If there's anything I liked, it was the noodles. Firmness was perfect and there was plenty of it.",

So I thought what a perfect time to try Republic Ramen & Noodles, and I made my way there.  It was around 4:45 on a cool wed evening the place wasn't too busy, what I didn't realize was this was sort of a fast food type of place, as soon as you walk in you see the menu to order off of. After checking it out, I went with Chili Pepper Ramen, soy sauce based infused with Thai Chili pepper, bell pepper & roasted garlic and it comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions, carrots & your choice of pork, tofu, spam, chicken or beef. I went with beef, I placed my order then took my seat to wait for it! You can add other items to your ramen at a low price, but since this was my 1st time I just went with the items already included   The soup came out, and I have to say it smelt soo good, and the flavor of the broth was good, but not spicy enough for me, but I added some sriracha and we were in business! I like that they use locally grown veggies and you can tell they are fresh, the spinach was perfect! Next time I will add more veggies to my ramen. The only thing that I didn't care for in the ramen was the beef itself, it was a thick slices of beef that was tough, like a tough roast, I didn't care for it, maybe next time I will just skip adding any type of meat at all, if I go back but it's a big bowl of ramen, and the broth was delish",

I always got the pork flavor broth with pork as well as egg and naruto. They may serve too big portions though as it easily fills me up and I only eat half of it. Great to go if you have a bad cold and are congested.. also can add some hot sauce to spice it up and really drain your sinuses! Also love the attached boba cafe,  where they make a great boba thai milk tea. I'll bring someone new next time I visit!",

    "text": "firstly, they get 2 stars cause of the good effort and the sincere service of the wait staff, who are obviously anime fans and like all things Japanese :) but seriously, very attentive and good service, only reasoin why i give them 2 stars  overpriced and very average broth.  For like 7 bucks u get 3 thin slices of \"char-shiu\" , some sprouts, some golden mushroom and decent amt of noodles.  But realy, its 2 bucks to add 3 more slices of char shiu ?  and like 1 dollar to add sprouts ?  come on, thats a rip off.    The only reason U go here is if u are too lazy to drive to somewhere better and really must have a hot bowl of ramen.  In this case I guess U can settle for this, but if U just want soup, go down to Khai Hoang on Apache and Mcclintock and U get much much better and more ingredients soupy broth noodles.  Dun go here for ramen if U can, go to like iKitchen or Sushi Ken, either one will top this place hands down.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner after a race at Tempe town lake after a long day without a real meal all day. I've been to 3 other ramen places in california, and this place was decent. I loved the ramen noodles cause they were cooked to my liking, not too chewy. The salt broth was pretty good, but there wasn't too much else in it like the other places I've been. I had the beef and it came with about 4 thin slices of overcooked meat, a good amount of beansprouts and spinach, and 3 small slices of carrots cut into flowers. Then again, it was only about $7 each ramen bowl, which was pretty large, and you could add extra toppings from $.50 - $1 (including extra noodles which left my friend's bowl nearly overflowing). The other places I've been are about $10 for a large bowl.  Service was great, they came to check on how we were all doing and if we needed anything else. My only complaint is that about 20 out of 50 of us were asked to wait as the kitchen closed for a bit, even when we made reservations for our whole group well ahead of time. So most of them ended up grabbing food elsewhere. This place was pretty good, so I'd recommend it if you were to come with a regular sized group.",

At first driving into the plaza, it bring back the days when I attended ASU.  This location used to be billiard place. It was definitely a college hangout, still is.  The space of the restaurant is huge.  They divided portion of the restaurant with a Boba bar.  I thought it was pretty neat.  I didn't try the Boba drink, but my friend did.  I can't remember what she had, but the drink was too watery and too sweet, according to her.  The menu selection is small.  I had ordered their house ramen, Republic Ramen.  It was supposed to be mild, but of course it came out with a kick.  You get two or three charsiu porks, so call veggies (lot of scallions) lack of spinach, and sprouts.  I think they forgot to put in the sprouts.   The soup base was spicy.  That was it!  The soup was very bland.  Was it worth the $6.95 for a bowl of ramen?  Not really!  Would I go back? Yeah probably so, the restaurant can fit a large crowd; friendly staffs, and good mid location (Tempe).",

I got the house, Republic Ramen, which was a little spicy but flavorful. The pork was thinly cut and I wish it was in a little smaller pieces. Star's vegetarian looked good. She got the tofu of course but only got 4 slices. The waiter made a point to mention that they were pan seared. She would have liked a few more slices after all the add tofu winds up being $.50 a slice. We walked away spending a little under $25 for two entrees an pp. of edamame and a 1 large Kirin. The broth makes a great second day soup with some buttered bread. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new experience at a reasonable price.",

The menu says that every ramen dish comes with spinach, sprouts, scallions and carrots. My order came with most of this, except the carrots. Instead, I got carrot. 1 tiny piece of a carrot. Haha.. that's a bit of a shame considering I love carrots. I wasn't expecting  a lot, but it was literally just a tiny nickel-sized piece of carrot. The broth was not terribly flavorful. The portion size was generous enough that I can get two meals out of it, which is nice for the price.  I also got the veggie tempura side, which is usually 3 dollars, but was only 2 because I came during happy hour. It was pretty good- highlight of my lunch/dinner.  The boba I got was definitely the best part. It might not be the greatest boba ever, but I'm not exactly a connoisseur so it seemed pretty damn good to me. I got the Thai milk tea, and it was super delicious with a generous portion of boba. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  The staff was very friendly.  All in all.. I think I might try some other dishes here, but I probably won't come back for the ramen. Will definitely return for tea.",

And it's actually not to far from the likes of the famous ramen joints in CA. I had a taste of the tonkatsu and miso ramen, and they were both pretty flavorful, with an O-kay broth. The noodles, like Angela Y. says, aren't too amazing. They're hard and the consistency is too instant-rameny for my liking. I had the curry and let me just say... the portions are humongous! Split 50/50 between curry (potatos, curry sauce, and carrots) and white rice, this thing will fill you up like no other. However, the curry's nothing more than the stuff you can make out of instant packets and microwavable meals.   The restaurant is large and accommodated our group of 30+ people very well. Service was spot on, though the register took some time due to credit card processing waits. Our servers brought our bowls out consistently and quickly, and everything came out freshly cooked.

Today I ordered  the spicy Tokyo Ramen with pork, adding in extra bamboo shoots, green onions, and double of their toothsome noodles to the broth. You have a choice of original  or traditional Japanese ingredients in your broth. Yum! Meats are slice super thin plus they also offer tofu, if you prefer. Besides traditional sodas, they have two great flavored ice teas, and a variety of delicious Boba teas so you can drink dessert with you lunch! ( The \"Sno\" desserts shop is now  attached to Republic Ramen. Try one and fall in love---  Chocolate, mango, coffee, melon ---similar to shaved ice but 100 times better!!!

So when I saw a ramen place, I thought I'd try this one out.  Walking in gave me a hip trendy vibe.  It's definitely college friendly.  A modern look.  The menu has everything you'd expect in a ramen shop: regular ramen, spicy ramen, seafood, and vegetarian.  But the star of the show is definitely the Tonkotsu ramen.  Even the cashiers would recommend this choice.  It's a milky pork stock soup.  I ordered it with chashu (Japanese soysauce marinated) pork and egg.  The ramen was cooked perfectly: bouncy and not soggy.  The thinly sliced pork had just enough fat to be tender and flavorful.  When they served it, it came with bean sprouts and spinach.  Everything came together with the help of the broth.  Adding a bit of the red pepper gives it a good kick, but it doesn't overpower the flavor of the soup.  I definitely recommend anyone with a passion for ramen and Japanese food to try this place.  For those who are indecisive or unsure what to order.  Repeat after me to the cashier: Tonkotsu ramen with chashu pork and egg please!  5 star only b/c of the Tonkotsu.",

The only downside is the horribly long lines during peak hours, when the queue goes out the door. The boba is decent, they didn't put very much boba into the cup, but it was delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend if you're craving good ramen or udon!",

The pork was definitely not what I expected. Not charshui style. It tasted very bland. Definitely had better coming from CA, but the broth was good, good portion size, and service was very fast. Price was alright also. Craving ramen in AZ, this is the place to go. Haven't found any place better.",

    "text": "Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!",

    "text": "First and foremost I made the mistake of ordering an Indian curry rice bowl at a Raman restaurant, regardless I gave it a try due to my love for Indian food.  The meal was definently a rice bowl, too much of one.  There is an overabundance of thick, tasteless white rice that dries your mouth out and gives your jaw a workout.  The curry sauce, while very savory and hearty, was so unproportionate to the amount of rice.  While the sauce was more of a gravy than a traditional curry, the stinginess of sauce left the dish a few strokes over par.  When I asked for more curry, I was told it would be another dollar.  In addition I regretfully added a side of chicken to add protein to the dish, as well as zucchini.  The chicken was so finely chopped and sparse, it seemed to amount to only about a drumstick worth of chicken.  The zucchini was raw and was pretty much tasteless.  The $12.00 price tag is not too expensive as far as restaurants go, it's a little pricey for a rice ball or a cup of noodles and broth.  An ending note, I tried the Raman broth and the two that I tried were amazing.  Also the sides looked pretty good and were about $4.  The restaurant has a fast casual chain feel to it which really pulls from the authenticity that I was expecting.  This is my first review and my dissatisfaction for this dish pushed me to finally post a review.",

With the price they charge you get a ton of anything, never a small portion, I was worried that I was going to get something little or not worth it but was I wrong. The bowls are HUGE HUGE HUGE and comes with a lot. Very delicious and fills one up easy. Really good service they always check on the people to make sure everything is going good in fact my friend accidentally raised her hand barely up and someone came running over to see if she needed anything.   Down sides would be a tad bit pricey but you get a ton, limited seating if it's a full house it might go bad, little selection of boba teas.",

    "text": "A foreword to this review- everyone PLEASE visit Republic Ramen for my own selfish purposes.  I've been waiting forever for quality boba somewhere near me and a legit ramen place.  This is it.  Support them :-)  MENU Noodles: The complaint from serious Ramen lovers here is that the menu might be a little limited.  However, it's Arizona, they're doing what they do right, and well, it's Arizona.  With the different varieties of add-ins and their spice/sauce selection, you can pretty much have any kind of delicious ramen you want.   They have 6 standard types of broth and 9 add-ins to mix it up.  They also have 3 combo options with edamame, gyoza, and curry rice.   Boba: In case you haven't heard, the restaurant is split into a tea care and a noodle house.  The tea cafe has a great selection of boba flavors, tea varieties and a good solid tapica pearl (not overly sweet).  Props to the Taro- it's my favorite I've had so far which includes Chinatowns in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. They also have Snows (basically an awesome slushy) and regular teas.    DRINKS: See above for the boba.  The owner said they're trying to get a liquor license and he envisions an alcoholic boba menu in the future. Whaaaat?  Best idea ever.  But, as of now, no booze.    VALUE: (hey, look! new cateogry to my reviews!) The ramen is priced exactly how it should be, so long as you save the double helping for the next meal.  Don't throw it!  It's completely comparable to Ramen in bigger cities.    CLEANLINESS/OVERALL QUALITY Brand new, spotless.  Great modern design and classy casual feel.    SERVICE They were a bit slow for what I ordered in the tea shop but the ramen comes out really quickly.  You can also order ahead for easy takeout.  I've only eaten in-house once so my service knowledge is limited.  Their takeout is 100% dependable, however.    ATMOSPHERE Urban casual without compromising atmosphere.  I would even take a date here- quick and funky, full of character, nice people, and definitely empty since this place is new and has trouble keeping a crowd (Again, please support- they're great!)",

He explained the menu to us, gave us his suggestions, and gave very detailed descriptions of everything they have. I had the tonkotsu ramen, spicy, and my dining companion had the republic ramen, spicy as well, both with pork. We grabbed our drinks (best iced tea ever!) and found a table. The place was modern, and most importantly very clean. Our orders arrived quickly in gigantic steaming bowls. While my fiances noodles were delicious, I defiantly out ordered him, my tonkotsu broth was heavenly. I loved all the veggies and the noodles were just right. And we both had enough for lunch the next day!   By the way, Ive been twice now and Ty has been working the counter both times. I hope the rest of the employees are even half as friendly and knowledgeable as he is! Every time I have a question he gives a very informative answer and always seems to be pretty passionate about it too.",

I got the Republic Ramen, its named after the place it has to be good.... well it's nothing to rave about really. The broth was pretty good though, nice spice but not over powering. I think i would most likely try some of their other stuff because that one either just wasn't me, nor did i think it was that \"four star\" amazing which people are raving.   The toppings are really skimpy and cheap for a ramen place that charges as much as they do. Don't bother getting a side it is way too expensive for just 2-3 pieces.   Don't get me wrong i'd go back.. but i don't think i will be going back because i crave them...not good enough to have me crave it. and the price, get a drink and a side and your tab jumps up...stay with just the ramen and drink water, there is enough sodium in there anyways.  Um drinks are really expensive here too, thought it would be cheaper since its right next to one of the biggest universities. guess they are trying to draw in a different crowd. The ASU flag hanging was really tacky btw. the store decor was nice besides that, had some nice flat screens to watch some game while you take your \"boo\" or \"shorty\" out somewhere besides that pub.",

They also have rice (gluten free) noodles.  Add a bit of the sarrachi sauce and it was tasty.  I couldn't finish the whole bowl.  Perhaps that has something to do with the $2 happy hour plate of vegetable tempura I ate... or the chocolate strawberry snow with boba that I had.  The boba is not as good as the one from The Boba House in Chandler.... a tiny bit dry in the middle.  Also, I had ordered a coconut strawberry drink and they accidentally made chocolate strawberry.  I didn't mind and drank it anyway.  Kinda wished I had the coconut instead but it was still good.",

As it stands, I'd have to agree with the people who said that the broth isn't really all that complex. It's fine, but it tastes more like it came from a dehydrated packet than from a huge stockpot in the back full of pork bones, roasted veggies, and spices. I might be wrong, but I just wasn't overwhelmed. I had the Republic ramen bowl with pork, and it was fine. The noodles were really good, but I was hoping for a slightly spicier broth. The rest of the ingredients were fine as well, and the bamboo shoots were nice and decently firm. If I came here again, tried another bowl, and enjoyed it, I'd easily give this place another star, but I wasn't impressed enough with what I had to give it a solid four-star rating. As it is, though, it's not bad, and a decent place for lunch if you don't mind a bit of the 'itis' after some slurping.",

The bowls are VERY large so I was shocked (even though they do have a bowl at the register to show you it looks very different full). Since it was so large he package the rest up for me to go. I also had a very yummy Boba on that visit as well.  The second visit I had the Republic Ramen which was spicy but VERY good. I opted not to get any meat in the noodles this trip as all bowls include Spinach, Sprouts, Scallions, Red Pepper and Carrots that was all I really wanted. This was so good I didn't have any left overs to take with me.   I will for sure go back and try a few other dishes and more Boba drinks!  The decor is very simple and clean so that is another plus in my book!",

Soda is self-serve.  I had ramen and spam, and it was my first time with spam.  It was good for what it was, but just not to my taste.  The rest of the soup was pretty good though.  The squid salad ($6 for a decent amount of it) was very good and the squid didn't have that weird rubbery texture it gets when it isn't quite fresh.  I got a mango-almond snow boba and it was amaaziing.  Seriously, try this.  The guy who made it even tried some and was impressed.  Definitely will go back here.

I ordered the Republic Ramen and the food came out pretty quickly. It was around $8-9. The place is cute, it was clean and bigger than I expected.  As soon as I tasted the broth, only one word popped up in my mind: bland. So I got up and got a bunch of sriracha, chili oil, and the chili pepper and poured them in, as I have done before with bland ramen.   It wasn't as bad as some that I have tried, but definitely not as good as ramen you'd get in LA. I liked the spinach (I love spinach), but I wish they put more sprouts. The beef was not that great, it was kind of tough. The soup needed way more flavor and waay more spiciness. I got the Republic Ramen cause I thought it'd be kind of spicy (it says it has spicy exotic peppers in the description). The bowl was huge though and I couldn't finish it by myself, next time I'll make sure to share with a friend. Because I was starving and ramen was the only thing I was going to eat that day, I ate quite a bit of it. But if it was a normal day and I was in a normal mood, I honestly probably would have boxed it and given it to my brother or something lol.  I've honestly made better ramen at home (not the typical stuff in a bag, but decent ramen). Thankfully it's fall break and I can run to LA to get my ramen fix.",

Man was I wrong. My friends invited me and when I showed up I was happily surprised by the very clean restaurant. Couples sat in the back eating and drinking sake. The lady at the counter was very friendly and when I asked for an explanation of the menu she was very helpful.   The menu works something like this: pick your broth (they have 5 or 6), then pick the meat. The vegetables are standard but they do have some extras including kimchi!  And the kimchi was amazing, the perfect amount of spice. And it tasted great when put into the ramen.   The goyza and tempura were amazing and after finishing them I only wanted more. I got their standard ramen with chicken and while the chicken was a tad dry (overcooked) the taste of the broth and the freshness of the vegetables more then made up for it.  Though I've only been once I plan on going again, to try some of their other broths.",

The place look clean and high tech, it looks impressive.  However, you can't judge a book by its cover.  I don't why they call their soup ramen apart from the noodle that they used.  It's so bland; well, if they were honest they should just call it noodles, and vegetables with soy sauce, but definitely don't call it Ramen because it is not.  If you ever tasted Ramen from Asia or if you visited Southern California, and had some Ramen, I would highly recommend that you stay away from this place.",

    "text": "Nope. Not the ramen I was looking for. We ordered Chili pepper ramen with original toppings/chicken, and tonkotsu ramen with beef/corn/original toppings. Meat on both was super bland and dry. I took a bite out of my beef and left it untouched otherwise. Corn tasted like it was out of a can. The biggest bummer were the noodles - they just tasted more like pasta noodles. Broth was decent, but nothing special. I'd say Tonkotsu was more flavorful, but felt on the heavier side. Maybe ordering all vegetarian would make it better. Doesn't even come close to ramen you get in California ramen houses and Japan.   The only redeeming part was thai ice tea boba drink. That one was pretty good.  Overall, we will not be coming back. I was looking for ramen and got something else instead.",

It is the only ramen place in Phoenix and just opened this March. We visited this place for lunch on Sunday. But after entering the door and feel the atmosphere, I had a good feeling already. The cashier was so passionate about his products and explained how the menu works in 3 minutes presentation, very impressive... I tried what he recommended , the tonkatsu noodle, the usual choice I make in Seattle. The price was cheap too for the huge portion they serve ($6.95/bowl). This is definitely a place to hang out if you want to not spend lots of money but still going home full.  I love his recommendation! And we tried the shrimp tempura appertizer as well, and the garlic sweet sauce is just addictive!  I recommend this place and definitely will come again!",

Clean white walls surround the modern chairs and deep benches with dark wood accents.  I love the splash of blue mosaic tiles up front as well.  Whoever designed the interior has a sweet sense of style.  The menu here is really no nonsense.  There's about 4 different types of ramen, an assortment of sides, and then there are multiple variations of Boba in the room adjacent.  I chose the Shoyu Ramen.  The broth was rich and savoury and provided a nice contrast to the simple noodles.  There were a couple large slices of pork in the soup, but I would have preferred more small chunks instead.  I liked that there were lots of bean sprouts in my ramen and it added a satisfying crunch.  I would definitely come here again when I want some Fancy Cup of Noodles without all the preservatives :o)  Don't get confused though, I say Cup of Noodles in loving jest, because really, it's ramen, but this is really good quality stuff.  Give it a try!",

The broth was watery and not rich or full bodied like miso should be. The flavors of the broth and the ramen + toppings just didn't tie together--I could tell there was something missing.   Atmosphere: Very lovely with lots of seating. I have to mention though that half way through our meal I realized my leggings were reallyyy stuck in something sticky on the bench I was sitting on. I laid 2 napkins on top of it and when I tried to take them off later, I couldn't! I literally tried to scrape the napkins off and they wouldn't budge! I let the staff know and apologized, and they as well, but...yeah, I had to pick mystery sticky junk off my leggings when we got home.   Service: Good but weird? Food came out quick, as I would assume ramen to normally be, and the staff were nice and funny and recommended things they liked. They were, however, having a rubber band gun fight with each other right in front of us while we were trying to make our decisions.. like rubber bands were literally being flown over the counter almost hitting us.   Price: Overpriced for the quality.  Bottom line--I won't be coming back here.",

All the base vegetables that are included in the ramen bowl w/out extra charge are not the type of vegetables that should be in a ramen bowl, instead they are vegetables that are more so a Pho bowl- carrots, bean sprouts, and spinach. Those are pho vegetables, not japanese ramen vegetables. The ramen vegetables that SHOULD be in a ramen bowl, however, are extra charge, ie. egg, corn, fish cake, etc. They're all extra charge. Doesn't make sense. As for the broth- average. The taste and texture is of the Pho variety as well. Tonkotsu broth is a milky pork bone broth, Ramen Republic's tonkotsu broth is thin and cloudy, not milky. Another issue I had was their spoons are really small and I kept having to find my small spoon within the broth, and wiping it down everytime it fell into the bowl. Probably won't come here again.",

The gyoza wasn't that great it was over cooked and frankly a bit too small but I mean it was only $3 (I think) so I guess you get what you pay for. The edamame on the other hand was super good. (a bit salty but nothing a good ol' napkin cant fix) in the end I would recommend this place to anyone that's looking for great (and cheap) ramen!",

So we sat there for like 30 minutes waiting for two simple boba drinks to arrive. When 90% of the tables in the restaurant were unseated and empty (read, a Ramen place not busy at 4pm on a Monday -  already a red flag!).   Other guests who arrived received their orders despite us arriving more than thirty minutes earlier.   Like seriously, how do you mess up your order chain this badly? You'd have to TRY that hard just to fail.   We spoke to staff, apparently there was a shift change.. But this still doesn't explain how you lose an order placed electronically into a Square driven point of sale system.   Literally if it wasn't for staff offering us larges instead of smalls (I paid for small sizes) I would've just gotten a refund. For this effort by staff, I'll grant 2 stars instead of 1.  If you look up the Google metrics for this place over a one year time span, you can see this place is getting less popular. I wonder if this has impacted quality of service over time.   As a point of fairness, my experience with Republic Ramen was not always bad. The first time I tried it in 2014 I remember the place being passable, but the last time I came here, my chicken was ice cold in a soup of Ramen noodles.   It's sad, because I WANT to like this place again, but the establishment just keeps letting me down.",

That can be a good thing, if you have an aversion to excess sodium. I took the leftover dipping sauce for my gyoza, and poured it into my ramen. Perfect! The sliced pork was really tender. To drink, I got the Green Apple Boba tea, with green tea. YUMM!!  My daughter got the passion fruit, and that was super yummy, too!

The food came quick, and prices are decent.   There are a variety of meats to choose from (to top the ramen with) such as chicken, spam, tofu, etc. and they are generous with the quantity of meat. For fast food its not bad.",

However, when I got home, noticed that they forgot to add the chicken to my Ramen. I called to speak with someone using the number on the receipt, nobody answered the phone after it rang about 20 times. I tried calling again and the same thing happened...no answer. My gut told me to check my order before I left because it was so big and unfortunately I didn't. We'll see if anything happens after this review is posted.",

There was a written list of items that were not available taped to the register. Weird.  Counter help walked away to do something else while I was in the middle of my order and with a line of people behind me.  Saw the kitchen from the counter. Looked like a disaster with a couple of guys working that looked like they had not a clue what they were doing.  Ended up walking out. Will not go back.",

They use very low quality meat for Chashu, too.  Being from Japan, I'm not sure if I would call this noodle dish Ramen.

One of my biggest fears when eating out is not being full when I leave, and that is especially True at noodle houses; however, Republic Ramen serves their noodles up in gigantic bowls that will challenge you to finish them and slurp up all that you can.  Ramen is what you make of it, and you aren't doing yourself any favors if you don't add some spices. Be adventurous and don't be afraid to try things that you can't pronounce. You'll thank me later.  P.S. the attached boba bar is decent. It may not be the best boba in the world, but the huge variety of flavors that they will let you mix and match can lead to some surprisingly savory drinks!",

    "text": "I had a craving for ramen noodles, and so I ended up finding this place through Yelp. My friend and I ordered a Shio ramen bowl with traditional toppings with beef and a shrimp tempura udon bowl with traditional toppings. My criticism lies primarily with the overall taste of the broths, the beef I got with the shio ramen bowl and the noddles (ramen and udon) in both bowls.  -The beef was bland with no flavor and tasted like it had been reheated.  -The noddles in both bowls were still aldente/ slightly hard, and not in a good way. It tasted like both of the noddles were previously frozen and only got 3/4's of the way cooked.  -The taste of each broth was overall lacking. If you are reading this and you've have Japanese ramen before and/or you have had any asian packet-ramen at home, you know that the noddles should have a deep flavor to them (either from a broth based in pork, beef, chicken, soy sauce, dashi etc and/or msg/ salt etc), and these...did not have any of that. Overall, my impression from walking out of the place was that I should have spent my money going somewhere else.  Positives: The portion sizes were good, although again, not worth much in terms of taste. The environment is cool and inviting.",

They lose 2 stars on the simple fact that for the past 5 times I've been there they f*** my order up. And what the f*** up isn't even a huge deal so I just can't wrap my head around why it keeps happening.   I always order the Sapporo ramen. It's SUPPOSED TO come with butter and corn in it already. And then I just add all the extras to it. It's there, on the menu, clear as day that the Sapporo ramen SPECIFICALLY comes with butter and corn. So when I place my order I ask for the Sapporo ramen, add egg and naruto. EACH AND EVERY time I get my order and all the extras I asked for are in there...but no butter or corn. Who the hell is working back there in the kitchen to get it wrong EVERY...SINGLE...TIME?!?! Not every now and again...but EVERY SINGLE TIME...  I can bet you $50 right now...that I'll walk in there, order it...and it will be wrong. I can 1000% guarantee it will be wrong.  I know what a lot of people are saying...\"What's the big deal? Just ask for butter and corn...\" Which, yeah sure...I would (actually I have to anyway since they won't give it to me to begin with)... But why should I HAVE to ask for something to be added to a soup that THEY put on the menu saying should already be in there?!?!? What ever happened to quality control??? Or can I safely assume that no one just gives a f***?  Here's an idea...just take it off the menu. You can't seem to get it right away...so save me the trouble of having to get angry about it later and just remove it off the menu.",

Regardless he didn't come back and I had to carry my huge bowl of ramen to the counter. 30 seconds later I got my actual order and the girl exclaimed \"they re-made it for you\" and brought me a side of cold hard boiled egg. The whole reason to pay the extra $1 for egg is to get a hot soft boiled egg in your broth. The egg was gray in the middle from being over-boiled. The soup itself was awful to say the least, and you have to eat it with disposable chopsticks and a metal ramen spoon. Now on top of it my boyfriend and I both have an upset stomach from eating here. Avoid this place, there's plenty of good ramen in Tempe.",

I had the Tonkatsu ramen and it was ALARMINGLY salty, to the point where I just gave up halfway through the bowl (and probably should have done so earlier). The noodles and toppings were pretty good but even for a salt lover like me, the broth was much too much. Bad start to my ramen search in Phoenix. Points for a clean, modern atmosphere inside the restaurant, but I won't be back.",

I had the shoyu ramen which was excellent and reminded me of the more traditional style I'm used to, but my partner had the Republic ramen which was spicy, delicious and of Korean inffluence. We also had the gyoza which were OK, but I thought they would be better. Next time I would opt out of those and maybe try a different side. There were also kim-chi, fried rice and edamame as other options for sides as well as other toppings for the ramen.  I was very pleased with my first visit and can't wait to go again. I do hope they expand and branch out the menu to some other ramen styles and maybe so other sides.   Excellent ramen and good work Republic!",

There was a guy with a mustache that came out from the back and walked the length of counter twice he looked at us but just put his head like we weren't there.

Rather than ramble on about ambiance, the service, the location I'll cut right to what matters: the food. I'm a vegetarian and as such I accept that my dining options are not as vast as those with unrestricted diets. However, Asian cuisine is generally very veg friendly and as such I dine at Asian restaurants probably more than any other type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Republic Ramen falls a touch short of what I'd call \"Veg Friendly\". The only option you'll have is the Vegetarian Ramen, which is OK because that is what I came in there for. And while the ramen was good (very rich, salty and tons of toppings) one dining option is not enough to make me a regular. It would be nice to try, say some udon noodles or an appetizer that isn't edamame.  Again, the ramen is good. And the price is fair. But would it really be so bad to leave the fish sauce out of a dish or two? Or to try using a vegetarian dashi instead of a fish-based dashi?",

The chicken was quite bland, and diced very small which made picking up pieces with the chopsticks quite impossible. The result leaves you with spoonfuls of bland chicken in the end, not the best ending at all to a meh meal. I suppose peddling this to college students, who haven't developed keen taste buds yet but have the disposable cash to not have to suffice on a traditional student based ramen diet, this place works. The staff was friendly and the meals were delivered quickly, even for a well packed house and close to closing time.",

Paired it with a Fire Rock beer (probably should have got boba). I can't compare it to anything else, since this was my first time, but I would have it again, trying miso or shio. However, the ramen here doesn't hold a candle in the wind to a hot bowl of Pho.

If you feel insulted by this sentence, then I would not recommend Republic Ramen + Noodles, but if you were intrigued by my question, look up the address immediately.  Besides, and I haven't done extensive research on this, but I believe that instant ramen in Japan comes with the broth, which leads me to believe that they don't even have what we call \"ramen\" in Japan.  For those who are neither insulted nor intrigued, just keep in mind that you are ordering soup for your meal.  If that won't fill you up, consider an appetizer.  There are a variety of styles and ingredients that you must select from.  Naturally, I ordered naruto with my ramen.  The reason for this will be left unpublished.

    "text": "I came here on Friday with a dire craving for Soba Noodles. I have never had Soba Noodles, before and I have been yearning it since watching a rerun of Iron Chef Japan the other night. Upon glancing over the menu I decided to order Shrimp Tempura Soba, $6.95 a Squid Salad $3 and bought a soda. All of which came to $15 bucks with tip. Not a bad deal at all IMO.  I began with the Squid Salad. A more than generous portion of Squid I thought for the price. It was cooked and marinated quite nicely. Next up, the main dish. The Tempura came on the side as 2 Shrimp Tempura and a piece of Carrot Tempura. The Tempura batter was actually quite nice, no complaints there. Now for the Soba. It came in a huge piping hot bowl. The broth was very clean, fresh, and enjoyable. The Soba Noodles tasted good I thought. I can't give a comparison to other Soba Noodles though, so I don't know if they were great of terrible as far as Soba is concerned, but I had no complaints. This is one of those things where I have to try numerous Soba Noodles to make a valid argument. But as far as I'm concerned it didn't disappoint. The one odd thing I thought though was that I did not see one Japanese employee in there. Kind of quirky, but oh well. This is a solid meal at a good value.",

    "text": "I had seen this place for months, and me and my friends finally stopped in for a try. It was pretty good! When you first walk in the doors it looks very modern. The menu is right behind the register in big print, you order, then sit down and wait to be served. The portions they give are fair to their prices (although the add-ons for the ramen are a little expensive) and you definitely feel full once you're done with your bowl. I tried the miso ramen and I enjoyed it. A couple things I didn't like; The boba tea. It's alright. I had gotten almond milk tea, and at first taste, it was weird. I could only taste the almonds and milk, hardly the tea, and the boba was very, very chewy. Eventually the drink grew on me a little more, but I have doubts on trying a milk tea again off their boba menu. Another thing, and this was just me personally- I had gotten miso ramen with tofu, but the tofu wasn't really satisfying. I was expecting the tofu to have warmed up and absorbed more of the miso flavor, however it was lukewarm, and just tasted like tofu. But thinking about this later, I realize that it's not miso soup with tofu already in it, they only put the tofu in when requested. But that was something I found a little disappointing. One final thing: I wasn't sure if I should tip or not. they bring out your food and take your plates away, but I hadn't seen anyone else in the restaurant tip, nor anyone at my table. I had tipped anyway, but I completely lost on whether I should have or not. This was actually very close to only getting 3 stars, but I'm giving it 4 with the benefit of the doubt that I'll try it again and like it even better next time.",

I was hopeful this would be almost as good as the Ramen houses in California such as Santouka ramen but no dice. I ordered the Shio (salt) ramen with traditional toppings. It was too salty, they took the name literally. Shio broth is suppose to be very rich, flavorful and fatty that is so delicious, you can't stop slurping. Their Shio was too salty with no flavor. Tasted like over salted Chinese won ton soup broth with no richness. The ramen noodles and the toppings were okay. Sliced pork was tender. If you're not expecting traditional authentic ramen house flavor, then this might be worth trying. Maybe their other broths are outstanding but I'm not willing to try again. I should have trusted my gut feeling that a ramen house shouldn't be serving, coffee and boba. Ramen house that uses Chinese restaurant chopstick wrappers should be a good clue that this isn't authentic. No Japanese or asian cooks here either.",

I love to be able to eat at a place that transforms me to a different country without the sixteen hour plane ride. At Republic Ramen, I look around me at a place full of Asian customers placing orders with a caucasian cashier that has the food cooked by hispanics. Ironic to say the least. The chopsticks were the cheapest imaginable. You literally had to be careful about splinters. Tiny 1-ply napkins were a hassle. Instead of being transformed to Japan, you are listening to Katy Perry blasting over the sound system. You order \"Burger King\" style at the counter and get your own drinks. I paid by credit card and had to trudge through  the Iphone credit card scanner that had me first have to decide on how much tip that I want to leave. Really?? This place is good for an emergency ramen fix, but I look forward to the day when we have some authentic Japanese ramen houses to choose from.",

As this was going on, I had noticed dirty tables all over the restaurant. Dirty dishes everywhere. I still continued with my order because the menu looked so delicious and I had planned on eating there for lunch and the place was busy. I ate outside because of all the empty dirty tables. It took 15 minutes , maybe a lil longer to be served my order. I wasn't even served , I actually had to go back to cashier and ask for my order. Honestly, the food was not worth all the poor customer service. I gave the restaurant a chance and I feel it was a waste of my time and money. I will never go back.",

The guy at the counter was super helpful, and he helped me pick out what to put in the soup... he didn't even seem (that) annoyed by all of my questions either, so that was nice. I really liked the way they garnished the soup, it had spinach, carrot, sprouts, and green onions. It looked really colorful and added some dimension to the soup. I added some of their spicy seasoning stuff and it was good. The noodles were really tasty, they were just the right texture for ramen, a little chewy. Gotta like that! Also, the chicken surprised me in how good it was! It looked not so great in the bowl, but when I tried it, it was so tender... like infused with the broth and melting in my mouth.... so good. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it. I will definitely come back here... if it was good in the summer, I can only imagine it will be great in the winter!",

Great service, quick, and really friendly. The style is kinda modern with a cool hang out vibe. (not sure if that is a thing but I'm making it one :))  The republic ramen was tasty. It is a little spicy. Comes with 5 or 6 slices of the meat of your choice, fresh spinach, and fresh bean sprouts. I thought the flavor was decent but missing a little something savory about it, but still overall good. I might be a little skewed because I haven't had ramen for a while and was craving it. But, I would definitely go back.  The boba was the highlight for me. The tapioca balls were a perfect balance of chew not old and hard like most of the places around here. The milk tea was a perfect amount of sweet unlike other bobas that make me feel like one sip and I'll go into instant diabetic shock.   Overall I love this place!",

I'll stick to the instant ramen before I order another bowl here though.",

I think it's worth the money, I'm usually filled to the brim by the time I'm done eating. Most ramen can be customized, you can choose what meat to add, you can also add fishcake, eggs, and extra vegetables. The basic ramen is loaded with vegetables anyway, so you don't have to drink a V8 later.   The atmosphere is a little awkward though, the usual music being played is pretty obnoxious. Otherwise a fine establishment, nice staff, clean floors, tables, utensils, etc.",

I've had miso ramen at Kabuki, but this place puts spinach and other veggies in the ramen. I missed the herbs that usually accompany pho to give it a fresh zing, but I can understand as ramen is a totally different cuisine and dish. The ambience was modern Asian with a mysterious, cool vibe. I want to go back to get some snow for dessert because I've heard it is like tasting a sweet/tangy cumulus cloud!",

I have had amazing ramen too many times now and when I go to a shop specializing in ramen, if it's not pretty great, then I can't help but hate it. They have \"tonkotsu ramen\" on the menu too so that alone sets expectations.  I ordered the \"tonkotsu ramen\" and hated it. Broth was weak with no depth of flavor. Noodles had no chew. As much as I hoped to love it, I was completely let down.  To be fair, I don't believe there is any decent tonkotsu ramen in Arizona.   I just don't see why this shouldn't be a concept that can be executed adequately here. For me, with the ramen I've had and love, it definitely wasn't.  Again, I'm not a fair judge of ramen. I'm mean and nasty about it. It's like sushi or uni. Once you elevate your expectations by having the stellar stuff, the mediocre doesn't cut it anymore.   And where I can eat American style sushi when I adjust my expectations (happy for crunch rolls and California rolls), can't do it for ramen.  If you're not passionate about ramen though, it's fine to ignore me. If you don't have amazing authentic ramen to hold it up to, it's probably fine.",

    "text": "Made the trek from Glendale to Tempe to try this place with friends after seeing the booth at Phoenix Comic Con. This just cemented my feeling that all of the cool and interesting restaurants are in the East Valley.  I ordered the tunkatsu ramen (sorry about the spelling) with beef and hubby ordered the spicy ramen with beef. I liked that there were lots of choices for broths and two different options for vegetables. The bowls of soup were HUGE- everyone ended up with enough left over for another meal. The broths were rich and salty, and definitely tasted like they had been simmered all day. The veggies were abundant and fresh and I felt like there were plenty of noodles although our friend disagreed. I would really have preferred that they cut up the pork in my soup- it was literally in large slices and was awkward to eat. Our friend had his soup with chicken and said it was diced, which makes much more sense.   Friends ordered the shrimp tempura and were pretty disappointed to find out that for $4 they got three pieces of shrimp and one onion ring, especially since the soups were so generous. They did say it tasted good, but that's still a pretty skimpy tempura for $4.  Prices were fair for the amount of food, at least for the soups. I wouldn't order the tempura again at that price. Part of me wants to say that since ramen is supposed to be cheap street food they could cut the price of everything by a dollar or so but then again, we all took home enough for another meal.  Oh, and although you order your food and pay at the counter, they bring it to you at your table and clear plates when you are finished. We tipped thinking that the restaurant wasn't full service and then felt bad afterwards. There is a cash tip jar at the counter if you make the same mistake though.",

And I will say the food was impressive, it tasted great, although I wish it were a little heavier on the noodles.   What I wasn't impressed with though was the price. A bowl of Ramen in Japan is like getting a hotdog from a street vendor in New York, it is supposed to be quick and inexpensive, and while I understand that it is a niche kind of dish here, I don't think $10+ for a bowl of soup and a drink is a very good value. We ordered an appetizer of Tempura shrimp too, $4 gets you three shrimp and a single onion ring. That actually kind of pissed me off.  The staff was friendly and the service was good and quick.

I've had Ramen at many different places before and understand that in general, Ramen is heavier on the salty side. But even my Japanese boyfriend agrees it is too salty. I like to finish all the broth because it's tasty but I can't here. Upside is that they give you a lot of broth.   Ingredients are good, both traditional and what I call \"American\" option, Boba is flavorful, I love that they offer beer. But I don't order the beer because the broth is dehydrating as it is.",

I was in heaven, but I am getting ahead of myself.  We started the dinner with an order of Shrimp Purses and Gyoza.  The price was four and three dollars respectively, and they came out in a hurry.  They were fresh, and they were great.  They were gone in a flash.  The main course was in a gigantic bowl, and that was way more than I could eat in a sitting.  I mostly ate the excellent broth, and I took the rest home to eat that night.  Man, I loved that place so much.  I will definitely go there again.  A+++ in my book!",

I had a glimpse of the kitchen on my way to the restroom and noticed only one guy in the kitchen. He had bowls of ramen lined up and seemed to be  haphazardly tossing toppings into each bowl...with his BARE HANDS. If you are going to do that I expect my Ramen to be ready in 10 minutes.   Quality of Ramen is below average. The temperature of the broth was lukewarm, not the typical hot of most ramen places. The ingredients in the Ramen were mediocre to say the least. NO complimentary HALF-EGG??? I guess this is what you should expect when you pay $8 for a bowl.",

I usually get chicken with ramen, but the beef was a nice change. Letting it stew in the broth for a while is key! The ramen itself wasn't \"wow,\" but the noodles didn't get soggy at all, so I didn't feel rushed to finish before they got overdone which I appreciate. All in all, I enjoyed my meal, but prefer udon over ramen for the price. I might be back to sample other thing on the menu though, all the descriptions sounded great!

I've only been to a couple other ramen places, but this one was different than those because you order at the counter. I got the vegetarian ramen with rice noodles, tofu, and original veggies. It was good! The veggies were super fresh, portions were massive for the price. My only complaint was that is was really salty. But not like so salty I couldn't eat it or anything. It was yummy! Also the place was clean and the staff was nice. I'd be happy to come back and maybe get some boba too next time!",

Squid salad was some of the best I've had! I also got the taro boba that was perfect after telling the man at the front desk I didn't want it to sweet I would definitely visit this place again and try out other menu options!",

My go-to dish is the Tonkatsu ramen with the original toppings and beef :)  The first time I went here I was ready to chew my arm off, so I was able to finish the whole bowl easily. That being said on subsequent visits I realized how large the bowls really are and I wasn't able to drink it all. Regardless of that, I love coming here. Having a good Ramen place down the road from campus is very nice. Next stop will be Shady Park so I can compare the two.",

It seemed as if they just melted a few bouillon cubes rather than it being cooked from actual ingredients.  I went there all excited that Arizona had a place dedicated to ramen and left so disappointed.   I really wanted to love the place.   The seaweed salad and kimchi were quite good however but again for a place that is titled Republic Ramen, one would think the focus would be on the actual ramen.  If you go to Ranch Market you can buy the Asian instant noodles and have a better tasting experience.    Although Toh San isn't great by any means - it was MUCH better than Republic Ramen.   If you get a chance to visit NYC - please visit Ippudo.  It'll introduce you to real ramen.",

    "text": "Nooodle Soup! Growing up, noodle soup was a staple in my family. From the 15 cent ramen packages, to the upgraded ramen/pho/vermicelli packages you would get at the Asian supermarket, to the real deal: Noodles made from scratch that my Nai Nai (grandma) would make.  Republic Ramen + Noodles really brought that soothing comfort food feel back, but without the guilt of prepackaged, processed, fried ramen. Nope these noodles are made fresh daily (or so the cashier told me with much enthusiasm when I asked him if the noodles were fried like the notorius 15 cent packages). Fresh ingredients of spinach, sprouts, and cute little petal shaped carrots to garnish your hot, steamy bowl.   The steps are simple: choose your broth, choose your protein, choose your add ins like egg, kimchi, or tofu. This place to me was genius. Noodle soup heaven and healthy to boot.  My favorite was the Tonkotsu ramen. I also tried the Shiro as well, but it was a bit too salty for my taste.  This place was right next door to the condo I rented out for Ironman Arizona. I enjoyed it so much I visited 3 times. Twice for noodle soup and once for the bubble tea. The snow drinks were a fantastic post race reward drink ( I had been eyeing them the week leading to the race). They were as good as I had imagined if not better.  Thanks RR for fueling me up with noodle soup goodness pre and post race!",

    "text": "I was compelled by another user to also comment about the sauce charge on top of other things. I get the Sapporo with Beef and enjoy the house sauce in my ramen, have been doing so for awhile now until I too was charged 50 cents extra for the first time. To be fair, the girl taking my order looked really sorry and even apologized. I understand this happens, a lot of fast food joints do this too now, but I never thought so would my beloved Ramen!  More on the service, it was pretty packed and there was a bit of a line behind me. I had gotten delayed because their iPhone reader stalled apparently and couldn't read my visa. I waited patiently, no big deal, but when the girl went to get i assume a manager, an older man, he came out and started screaming at her in Spanish, in front of all of us. Not cool dude! I have worked in the food industry myself and there is a lot of pressure to cater to hungry people constantly so having a crappy boss is the worst. She was also hispanic so i was the only one who didn't know what was said, i doubt it was pleasant. I felt so terrible for her, I thought the days of HR and lawsuits had phased out unprofessional management but this guy really took a dump on this poor girl. I ended up waiting a solid 8 minutes for their iPhone to work and I could hear a couple behind me snarling. The manager didn't even apologize to me, unlike this young girl, he just yelled, stood around for a few moments, then headed to the back. I felt so bad and tipped the girl a $5, it's not her fault their services weren't working, adding extra anger from impatience on top of a douchebag boss doesn't help anybody!! Treat these kids with respect, they're just trying to get by in life with probably minimum wage to feed our mouths and fund their livelihoods! The asian guy that brought my food out was super nice also. He asked me how my day was and told me to let him know if I needed anything else which was a nice touch. He was very nice looking and very proper and friendly, I would see him come and go quickly taking dishes to the back while simultaneously bussing tables and talking to customers, so the kids working in the front here aren't a problem. Though it was rather busy so I was surprised to only see two of them working. I have worked in a place as busy as this with 5 people easily on a shift.   Furthermore, in all that time at the counter, I noticed the manager and cook speaking Spanish while blasting Spanish music in the kitchen. This isn't foreign in AZ, but it makes you wonder how \"authentic\" their food is. Not to be stereotypical, but I've noticed that the best places to eat whether it be Indian, Chinese, mexican, Japanese, or what have you, are always best by the actual people that the food comes from. I understand its probably easier to hire some cheap laborers but it makes you think about how far the owner is willing to go for quality. I never noticed this before but got to notice everything while waiting.   Finally, the food! As I mentioned I love getting the Sapporo with Beef. People complain its a bit too watery which I have to somewhat agree with, but that's why I like adding the house sauce with the chili sauce! I'm not too fond of the extra charge but it happens, I guess. I highly recommend the boba milk teas also! The prices are a bit much compared to some other places where you can get something similar like Pho, but the convenience is nice, that is if you're not waiting in line forever!  Two stars for the food and service from the guy juggling serving and cleaning and the girl taking orders while putting up with a tyrant.  Minus one for the delay, they should have a backup credit reader. I understand the need to be cool and modern with an iPad and iPhone but sometimes the old ways work best. Also, it may help having a second register and more people working.  Minus one for the sudden price charge and ambiance of the fiesta going on in the back.  Minus one for the ultra rude manager for not even acknowledging me and for YELLING at an employee just doing her job in front of everyone! He's lucky I wasn't a lawyer! This should be minus two but I don't think this place is a one star. It's a place that could easily be 4 or 5 stars with some time and growth.  I'm not sure if you can revise scores on here but I hope I can later when I see some improvements. It's the little things that add up to annoy and the big things like a bad atmosphere that kills a place. I would come back when it's not so busy and maybe if there's a different manager on duty!",

So here goes it: I ordered a tonkotsu ramen and it did not hit the spot. Their broth needs flavor other than just salty. Where was the pork flavor?  The charsui pork needs to be simmered more to make it tender. Perhaps they can use some mushrooms, non-intrusive veggies and aromatics to wake up the flavor to make it a True charsui. Also work on a finishing sauce to add to the bowls of ramen shortly before serving. There's a good market out there for them.  I hope they can significantly improve on their products. Republic - that word sets high expectations.",

The tonkotsu was great with te addition of corn and an egg, and the Sopporo was pretty good too. To even out the review I will say I'm not sure why they decided they needed to shower the kimchi with scallions or why the seaweed salad was so sweet, not in a bad way, just different. they need to perfect their noodles a bit, but it won't stop me from coming back.  :)",

This place is very nice and spacious, lots of room and has a modern-esque look to it. I ordered the Ramen Republic and had a taste of the Tonkatsu Ramen.  The Ramen Republic was \"spicy\" but honestly, if you're a person who loves spicy food, you're going to have to dump some of their spicy seasoning in there. Overall, I thought the taste and flavor wasn't so bad; the tonkatsu was very brothy and had a good pork flavor, the ramen republic had good flavor but wasn't spicy. I wasn't a big fan of their noodles, too hard in my opinion. Also, there are only 2 slices of pork (or any other meat)... which is simply not enough if you want to enjoy something hearty and delicious like ramen. Great thing is that they have a good portion for their ramen noodles. You can add more but it'll cost you a dollar or two! However, the taste and noodles are just not up to par with some of the LA ramen places.  The staff was extremely friendly and great to us. There was one guy who had just started that day that I wouldn't have known if he never told me. Really great service especially with a group as large as ours (~30 people).

I had been raised thinking ramen was just noodles in a package that you boil for 3 minutes and add the contents of a silver packet (predominately made of sodium), and voila!   This place is fantastic delicious offering ramen, udon and rice dishes with fresh ingredients for about 6.50 an item. The servings are absolutely huge, but fantastic.    My boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. It was quiet inside, but the cashier explained they just finished with their dinner rush.  I ordered the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the curry rice with a side order of goyoza. There were three goyoza to an order, and to be honest, they were small for the price.  The miso ramen and the curry rice were both very good.   We went there a week later (due to a hankering of mine) and decided to share a bowl of the republic ramen along with edamame and veggie tempura. All of it was delish.   The only downside to the restaurant is that it smells like a grease fryer.  When we left, our clothes stank like grease.     Other than the smell of grease, the place is fantastic.",

My wife and stepson enjoyed theres more than I did mine. Portions are a good size.   I don't know, I thought it was good, but not great. There is nothing wrong with the place, but I doubt I will come here very often. Give it a try, by all means, but don't expect something spectacular.",

As the name implies, this is a noodle house.  They have soba and ramen, at the minimum.  They also had at least one rice bowl (curry).  We ordered one of each; that is one ramen soup bowl and one curry rice bowl.  I added chicken to the curry (it's meat-free otherwise).  Yes, they charged extra for that.  The verdict?  It was fine.  The curry was a darker curry but had the classic Japanese curry flavor.  It was good.  The ramen soup was OK.  Nothing special.  The noodles were properly cooked (not hard, not mushy).  The flavor didn't 'wow' either one of us.  It was fine, but not great.  I would not make a point of coming here, especially all the way from Chandler or Gilbert.  If I were in the area and had a craving I'd be willing to stop by again.  But it won't be a dining destination.",

I'l give it one more try.\"  Well I ordered the Republic Udon with added Beef Slices.  On my first sip, I nearly choked coughing.  What the heck?  It seems they tried to resolve the flavor problems of the soup in the past by adding tons of salt.  There was no extra flavor just extremely salty.  The beef slices were decent.  I tried to tough it up and once again sip the soup .. but to no avail.  My body was complaining violently.  I asked the cashier if they had a lighter broth but she said that all the soup bases were the same and that they could give me vinegar to lighten the taste.  This is not a solution so I asked for a refund, of which she gladly did without complaints and apologized that I didn't like it.  The two stars are for the good customer service.  Tons of non-Asian college age people eating here.  I guess they like it.  To each their own.  I went and bought a bag of Nongshim noodles at the Oriental Market.  Way better for under 2.00. :)",

I ended up deciding on the Tonkotsu without meat and adding an egg into it. Over all pretty well done, loved the noodles and veggies combo!

The ramen was grossly overcooked. The noodles had been over soaked with the broth and showed signs of being overcooked. The noodles were so swollen that they seemed to fall apart when you tried to pick it up for eating. The broth itself was nothing to brag about. I also ordered an egg for an extra cost. To my dismay, the egg was just a hardboiled egg rather than the soft cooked egg that usually comes with ramen. Also, I want to note that I love bamboo shoots. But, there was definitely too much bamboo shoots added as part of the original toppings. I do not recommend this restaurant and I will not be back.",

Republic Ramen was very good and definitely worth going back again.  My son has actually already asked when we'll go back!  We ordered the gyoza, Republic Ramen with pork, Shio Ramen with chicken, and Chili Pepper Ramen with chicken.  I was pleasantly surprised that the Republic was spicier than the Chili Pepper Ramen, but it was just right for my tastebuds.  Portions are great for the price too.  We were able to split one bowl between our 2 kids.    If our next visit is as good as this one, I'll up my rating to 5 stars.",

I was quite disappointed with Republic Ramen's Tonkotsu. The noodles didn't feel right and were way too thick, also the broth wasn't very appetizing. I actually didn't even finish my first bowl of ramen from this place when, at most ramen restaurants, I usually get more than one bowl.  My girlfriend had the Tokyo ramen and said it wasn't bad, but my experience with the Tonkotsu was a different story.  I will say that the restaurant seemed clean and I felt welcomed, therefore I won't give it a 1/5 star review, but I don't plan on coming back here ever again due to how bad the ramen was.",

With the conflicting reviews, I was never compelled to go. Until one day, I was in a curious mood and adventurous. I decided to give it a try for lunch one day. Can't judge something until you've experienced it for yourself, right? I went in around 12 and they had a decent lunch crowd. This made me optimistic! I saw there was boba on the menu, a small selection, but a selection nonetheless. I became even more optimistic!   I ordered a pork ramen and a Thai tea with boba. Now that I've had ramen from multiple places, this place does not compare. The broth is bland and doesn't have the authentic flavors often found in a pork bone broth ramen. I also wasn't a fan of the noodles or the veggies added to the ramen. The Thai tea was a big no. It's premade and was way to sweet. The boba texture was poor and didn't end up finishing a drink. I love boba so for me to not finish one says something.   The ramen was somewhere between $8-$9 and the tea was around $3. I would prefer to go to some other ramen places in the area over Republic Ramen.",

I give them 3 stars because their menu was not well-labeled. When we ordered, we asked if the food was vegan, and the cashier confirmed they were. However, when our food arrived it most certainly was not. The server was quick to fix it with the right foods.   VEGANS: be warned that they put egg noodles in every dish unless you ask for rice noodles. All the broths *except* the vegetarian broth are pork based. The vegetarian broth is soy sauce based, so it tastes like soy sauce diluted in water. Also, if you order the traditional toppings, \"naruto\" is a fish cake (those cute pink swirls).",

Great customer experience and service, prompt, polite and courteous.    I had the Chili Pepper Ramen traditional style w/pork (recommend you get the half order of extra noodles) the flavors and balance of the ingredients were on point. My wife had the Tonkotsu Ramen w/pork, loved the flavor combination that she had and next time I will get that broth with the Chili Pepper Ramen spices.  Not tooo many places in the valley can say they are truly Ramen, this place is authentic and reasonably priced.  Come out and support Republic Ramen!!!",

My friend, who seemed pretty knowledgeable about ramen, suggested we try this for lunch. I was in since I love trying new places.   I ordered something pretty ordinary as a newbie. I didn't want to venture out too soon. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen with chicken, which is veggies and bits of chicken over a soy based broth. The price was about $9.00.   We waited a bit since the place was becoming crowded at about 12:30. What I ordered was okay for the first few bites. The broth was a perfect temperature and the noodles were good. There were lots of noodles in the broth and the bowl topped with spinach, carrots, etc. and the bowl was pretty big.  After about 10 minutes of eating, the broth became cold and I was tiring of the noodles. I needed more texture and a mouthful of flavor. Ramen didn't cut it for me. I need heartier food.   I supposed if I were a college student, I might love this place. It is big and open with large tables. I'm sure ramen hits the spot on a cold day. I'd like to go back and try the boba.

We were underwhelmed, we felt the vegetables weren't washed enough & I wish the chicken didn't taste so rubbery. I just picked around what I didn't like in my noodles & It wasn't that bad! I had the chili noodles, the flavoring was amazing! The area was pretty nice as well. Another downfall was the soda, it tasted different than other soda machines I have drank from. I don't know if every soda in the machine tasted different but I know the Dr. Pepper was off to me. I don't think I would visit again.

For one, they addressed my complaints about the separate menus by making it possible to order boba drinks at the ramen counter. They've also changed the way ramen is ordered, and there's more of the veggies/protein than when they started, which was one of my main complaints.  The menu has also expanded to udon and soba, and there's an extensive sake menu.  Yet the novelty of this place has worn off.  There's still some elementary problems: The amount of protein/veggies is still not enough compared to the amount of noodles given. Shrimp tempura udon was just 2 pieces of shrimp and 1 onion tempura? I paid $8 for that? Do you realize you can make udon at home for $1, which means you just charged me $3.50 for each fried shrimp?  The broths are way too salty. I've tried the whole gamut of them, and whenever I leave, I have to run to the nearest water source and drink a gallon of water. A few times I've even experienced the unpleasant film in my mouth left by MSG. I really hope they're not using MSG to flavor the broths, but I'm not sure what other ingredients are capable of leaving that weird aftertaste/film.  And why is it closed on Sundays?!",

I had to stop myself from going a third time because I could sense a snowball effect happening (both the fear I might start living there and the fear of becoming rounder and rounder in the mid section).   Went to Japan last year and fell in love with kyushu/hakata ramen. Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe's is closer to what I had in Tokyo (though only half as good), but this was still very good. Got the Republic ramen which came as a nice big helping, piping hot. The noodles were done perfectly - not overdone. The pork the first time was super! I could taste the ginger and the pieces were large and lean. The second time I was disappointed in the pork - it was a smaller portion, fattier, and less taste. I did fear they pulled out the big guns for opening weekend and won't be the same from then on. Guess I'll have to go a third time to get a good average.   I agree with others on here - skip the gyoza. I'm a huge fan of gyoza when done right, but these were greasy and thick with no dipping sauce if I'm remembering correctly.   Oh - and yes, the look is modern but the benches have a bit of an unfinished edge. I thought I was going to get a splinter. Look out for this or opt for the high top seating.",

I've had the curry bowl as well as the noodles and all are excellent. The shrimp & veggie tempura are great as well and the sweet, dark dipping sauce that accompanies the fried delights also ends up in my soup, to boot. Color me addicted. The staff is young and knowledgeable, and have accommodated some very tricky dietary demands from friends of ours with very specific food allergies.  Best of all, it doesn't cost us an arm & a leg for a hugely satisfying meal. Highly recommended gem of an Asian restaurant in Tempe AZ.",

Don't be fooled by the $2 gyoza dumplings; they're the size of a quarter and there's only 3. Also, if the girl asks you if you want garlic, say no because she doesn't tell you that it's 50 cents extra and you'll never taste the difference.   The flavor of the broth is good, decent portion sizes. It's better to order without meat, because I've tried all their meats and they're all pretty terrible, dry, and tough. Their chicken is actually kind of gross. Even though ramen is supposed to have a lot of toppings, only order toppings if you want to spend over 10 dollars for a bowl of noodles because each one is about $1, and they're not very good and in small portions.  Their tempura is pretty good and the best deal on the menu is the udon with tempura. Their boba is pretty good for Arizona.  However, I have some issues with their customer service, the last two times I've been they've over charged me by adding things like eggs that I didn't want and then would not take it off my charge. Their staff is pretty rude in general, so I probably won't go back because I seriously value an overall experience.  A little disappointing because it is in a great location and there aren't many ramen places around.",

I had ordered \"Shio\", which is usually a light colored broth flavored with salt or \"shio\"(Japanese for salt).  The broth of the ramen I got was dark colored as a \"Shoyu\" (soy sauce) broth would be.  It seemed like they used their basic \"Shoyu\" broth, and added salt to it  - which made it very, very salty :-( Sad to say, but that ain't authentic shio ramen broth...  But the chasiu, roast pork, tasted like it should be.  Wished that the bean sprouts and spinach were blanched as they are in Japanese ramen.  Having uncooked bean sprouts thrown in makes it a little too crunchy for my taste.  The noodles were cooked well.  Definitely give it a try!",

If you are looking for a True ramen place, this is not it and if you are a purist-who-complains-a-LOT, stay away! I recommend it to most otherwise.  The Food: Fortunately, the range of additional toppings is pretty good, but every little bit adds up. The total for my order of Spicy Ramen +Egg +Chashu +Vege Paste +Garlic Paste +Chili Paste and a regular drink adds up to $17.27!!!  The soup is what resembles instant noodle the most. It taste like plenty of MSG in it, but is so delicious, I finished it anyways.   The Place: The place looks even more spacious due to it's open design. Definitely a hipster vs foodie place. There is a bar/restaurant combo on one side and a regular restaurant on the other side.  Da Service: This place is pretty much self-service except when they bring the food to you. You order it at the counter. They give you a placard on a holder with a number for delivery to table. Condiments and utensils are near the soda machine.  Ultimately:  Not too bad. Not excellent. A good place for students, which seems like the bulk of their customers anyways. Unless you are overly critical over ramen, add this place to the list of backup restaurants especially on a cold day (but this is AZland!).",

    "text": "Republic is great. The service is fantastic and they truly bust their ass to bring the customer the highest quality ramen in this part of town. The prices are fantastic as you can get a huge bowl of delicious ramen for a mere $7 max. When I went I got the tonkotsu (awesome pork broth) with pork and naruto (I would also recommend, of course, an egg but they took all their eggs out of circulation because of a state?wide or countywide recall).  Really cool honesty and professional call on that as even though, as our waiter explained, that their eggs were organic and locally raised and completely unaffected it was better to be safe than sorry and save face if somebody were to ask questions concerning the eggs, BUT I digress.   The ramen was made FAST and served beautifully. The fixings, condiments, and utensils were all abundant, varied, and self-serve and I found that so convenient and well thought-out. Drinks are cheap and self-served and their boba was great.   I highly recommend the mango-almond snow and the taro-blueberry snow. My only con to the boba would have to be that it's a bit of a wait (between 10 and 20 minutes) but that's only because they have to boil the tapioca to order but at least you know you're getting a good product made fresh. Either way, it's a ramen joint and there aren't too many places around the Tempe ASU campus that sells boba, nonetheless fantastic tasting boba like this place. Best way to do it is to order your boba for dessert about halfway through your ramen so you can have sweet slushy finish to your salty, warm broth dinner. Drink water during your ramen as to not muddle and disrespect the ramen's flavor.  Service was great and really you can't ask for more than a friendly-face and enthusiastic service in a cheap high pace college ramen joint that is beautifully decorated and cranking out delicious soups minute after minute for the hordes of broke college kids and hungry twenty-somethings looking for something else than In-N-Out.   Grab your girl or dude, order some ramen, get some boba, sit back, and enjoy.",

The noodles were the best part, and the staff who took our order said they special order the fresh ramen noodles from LA. The broth (I had the Spicy Republic) was also pretty good, if not a tiny bit over salted. However, I'm used to real ramen, where the bowl is rich with vegetables, herbs, bean sprouts, meat, tofu, etc.  Here, you get noodles and broth and just a few small pieces of carrot, a handful of bean sprouts, a handful of spinach, and whatever protein you choose. THEN, you can add on for $0.50 an item what is typically already in the bowl at a traditional ramen house.   We also ordered the Japanese curry - also just okay. There isn't anything bad to say about it, but there wasn't anything to rave about either.  Cleanliness and customer-friendly service here were 5 stars - greeted when we came in, the server/cashier explained everything he knew about the menu and made pleasant suggestions. I saw him and the other server do the same thing with all of the other people waited on, so they are also consistent with their excellent service.   I'd definitely go back, but I know what to expect now. It's a good bowl of noodle soup, but it wasn't the ramen I was craving.",

    "text": "I would take Republic Ramen for what it is- fast food ramen priced inexpensively, located in the heart of a college town.   There is, unfortunately, a huge dearth of good ramen places here in Phoenix. When my girlfriend told me about this, I was keen on checking it out. I love Cherry Blossom, but it gets a bit boring to have that be the only joint in town I enjoy ramen at! Also, nothing helps clear blocked allergies like hot ramen and a steaming cup of green tea!   I got the tonkatsu ramen, whilst the boyfriend got the miso ramen. I had no complaints about mine. It wasn't rocking my proverbial world, but it was good decent food. It tasted like tonkatsu broth, and I liked the fresh spinach, bean sprouts and the egg I paid extra for.   His miso ramen, however, was very disappointing. A friend had warned me that this was 'white people ramen', and his ramen lived up to that warning. It tasted like bland, straight up soy sauce broth. No trace of miso at all. I actually forgot he had miso stock and not the soy sauce before he reminded me about it.   The gyoza were also nicely edible, but nothing to go home talking about.   As I said, take it for what it is. Fast food ramen in a college town. It's good to satisfy your cravings, but not something that will rock your world. Not everything can be 5 stars. My suspicion is that you'll find just such mediocre ramen places even in Japan.",

Plus they just expanded the menu to include other classic fast Japanese favorites - curry, udon combos, etc. The space is beautiful, and the employees - every last one of them - are so friendly and helpful and accommodating. This is such a five star place!!!!  Minor quibbles - extra spicy broth is almost indistinguishable from normal broth, and the curry is not traditional Japanese curry. It's OK, but not what you'd expect. Major quibble - what they charge for protein is simply outrageous. A few sprinklings of chicken, a few slices of pork or beef, a few cubes of tofu = two dollars added on??? An already pricey $7 bowl becomes a $10 bowl including tax because a (very) little protein is added? Unless this is Kobe beef, this is outrageous. Penny wise and pound foolish guys - triple the protein you serve or cut its price in half. The current pricing is crazy.  C'mon guys - you're so five stars, just fix the protein problem! In the meantime, dear reader, this is still a place to relish at any price.",

Flat out, ANY Japanese-style restaurant that sells chu-hi gets my nod of approval. I absolutely love that cheap, wine-cooler like liquor and it's so, so difficult to find in the states. The boba here is really nice as well. The guy working the counter the first time I had boba was even considerate enough to ask me how sweet I wanted it!  I had the vegetarian ramen and gyoza when I ate here. I am very particular about ramen, and for me the broth wasn't complex or flavorful enough. I am planning to go back and try the tonkatsu ramen as a final verdict, so we'll see. Plus the gyoza was deep fried, and I was hoping it would have been prepared more authentic-style--steamed on the top and crispy only on the bottom.  Overall, this place is a nice homage to authentic Japanese ramen shops (even in decor), but not quite the real deal.",

For the price it is a good filling meal and when you add the $1 off coupon from the campus discount books its perfect. The gyoza are great crisp but not too crisp and the flavor and the flavor of the sauce is great and at 3 for $2 not a bad little side dish with the soup.  They also make a pretty good mocha which I tried the other day and the boba's are fun but I have only had the thai tea version.

She knows I love ramen and warned me ahead of time that it wasn't L.A. standards. We walked in for lunch right when they opened. She ordered me a tonkatsu ramen with spam.  One of her two friends that had joined us said, \"really, spam?\" \"Um.... yeah, you know, the canned meat? There's even spam rolls in Hawaii, musubi. Did I just blow your mind?  The boys were talking about chess and I mentioned I was in a chess club in elementary school. They both looked up startled and Jenni started laughing and said, \"Yeah, she's a big nerd and I used to balance her out, but I lost control over this when she moved to LA\". Now she does things like book clubs and Yelp.   I endured what seemed like endless questioning on all things Yelp. \"What do you do on Yelp? Will you be reviewing our house later? Can we find you on Yelp and leave comments?\"  Ah.... Arizona...... need I say more?  So back to my ramen, definitely not traditional, average noodles, and broth lacked depth. They did get the saltiness right and overall the taste was decent. I liked their space- clean, high ceilings, big windows, and modern decor. Worth a revisit when I'm in the desert and have 400+ miles between me and LA ramen.",

I'd only ever gotten the shoyu ramen which literally just tastes like soy sauce. This time I decided to go with miso ramen with tofu and original toppings. I asked if I could get another vegetable or more carrots in place of sprouts because I do not like sprouts, and the cashier simply refused both requests. I'm not paying for an extra vegetable after you take one out. How hard is it to put more carrots and not put in any sprouts. It's not as thought the veggies are cooked into the soup. Well I decided I didn't want to spend more on this soup than necessary, so I chose to forego paying extra for the egg. I got my soup shortly after, and I wan't completely satisfied. It has so little veggies in it, and guess what?! There were a little bit of sprouts in it. I pick out as much as I could find and put it on the table, and I ended up crunching on a few I didn't find before. How hard was it to put one ingredient less? Completely refused to give me what I asked for. I'm not in the business of giving my money to places that don't service me to satisfaction, so since that cashier wanted to make a stink about a veggie substitution, I'll find some place else to get my ramen next time.",

If you have a choice,  go to Umami, it is a night and day difference in quality and service.",

    "text": "Great, fast service and a nice clean atmosphere for some pretty cheap prices. I generally get their (fancy and tasty!) iced tea and add the garlic and soy-soaked egg to my soups, which makes things closer to 10 bucks a head.  Not all of the broths are for everyone; I like the tonkatsu broth the most and don't really get the chili-oriented broths, but my wife's reasonably fond of those. The sapporo corn broth is really fun. There are lots of condiments for the soup: the togarashi chili powder's generally enough for me, but if you'd like your soup saltier/sesame-er, go for it.  The curry rice is surprisingly excellent, too! It's really hard to justify gettin' that when you're at a ramen house, though.  There's better ramen in the valley, but not with this price or the fun amount of options. The veggies are unique and fresh, and everyone's super friendly. It's a great place to warm your bones when it's cold or rainy outside.  Pro tip: eat most of the spinach before it cooks in your soup if you don't want it to alter your noodles' flavor.",

So walking into a restaurant that specializes in ramen, I didn't really know what to expect.  Luckily, the guy working behind the counter was nice enough to walk me through the various ramen options so I knew just what I was getting myself into.  This ramen is like the store bought stuff on steroids. First of all - they give you a ton! I couldn't even get through half of it. Secondly, it includes something the store stuff lacks - fresh ingredients. Mixed in with the noodles was spinach, carrots and I chose pork as my meat. The broth was flavorful and the noodles has a nice flavor and consistency. I would have liked more pork though. The meat to noodle ratio was a bit unbalanced.  I think this place is a good alternative to other asian restaurants and would make a great option for a quick and filling lunch.",

Eager to share about the different flavors!  The Ramen was wonderful. There was a nice amount of vegetables and a lot of tofu. The flavor of the broth was amazing. The noodles were cooked just the way I like them. The boba was fresh and I tried 2 different flavors. I had one with espresso that came recommended by the boba barista for the caffeine kick I needed, it was full of flavors as he said! I truly enjoyed it all and I will definitely be back soon.",

Their default republic ramen dish is pretty solid and has good flavor.  I'd like to get back and try some of the others.  It would be nice if they possibly offered some of their dishes with a choice of noodles but being a ramen house they specialize in that type.  Very friendly staff and great portions for the price.  It would probably be best to add extra addins but then the price does tend to go up.  All in all it's a solid place for some good ramen.",

I can appreciate taking a simple dish and making it the main feature of the restaurant.  The noodles here is good and spicy I must say - if you need more spice; grab yourself a bottle of Siracha.  I can't handle my spice like I used to and it was just right for me.  Decor was simple Ikea like furniture - nothing wrong as long as it works.  Service was good with a friendly smile.

Okay, I'm getting ahead of myself here; ordering was a bit intimidating, since it was my first time here. My friend was with me and walked me through it, it was a breeze! The guy who took our orders was nice and chatty, we sat, and our food came out fast - I was pretty impressed with the setup, really nice, modernized, and delicious.  The ramen is flavorful, the bean sprout crunchy, the carrots crunchy, the spinach delicious, and the noodles are al dente and then when they sit in the bowl at the bottom, it soaks up the broth and the flavors of whatever else you ordered as another topping! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!",

The service was fast and friendly, the noodles were excellent, the portions were generous (though the meat could be a little MORE generous, given the price of the dish), and the honeydew milk tea was refreshing.  During the meal the chef came out and chatted with our table a bit. Sounds like they'll be adding more types of noodle dishes to the menu shortly.

Tried the miso ramen this time, but if it wasn't for the miso floating in the soup, I'd think it was normal shoyu broth. They did try to be creative with different veggies, but the baby spinach is not a great idea as it broke down quickly in the hot broth, which was still hot after a while, so a plus there. Maybe I've been spoiled by other ramen shops on the west coast, but I find this place forgettable. Well, the only thing I won't forget is not wanting to come back.",

So, I stood up and went behind the line. This time, Im the 8th customer on the line. The person behind the counter (Barclay with a brit accent) didnt bother to tell me that I have to order from the counter and then sit myself...WTF! Employees seems  like ASU students who couldnt care less about what we say with regards to their customer service skills. No enthusiam at all. I dont blame them, this isnt their career anyway. They are just passing by. Try ramen houses in Los Angeles area, the servers are as enthusiastic as the servers in Japan.  Yes, I have lived in Japan for 4 years, thats how I know.  Thai Tea w/ boba: How can someone F this up anyway? It's good.  The Ramen: ( had the miso ramen with pork) I guess its good for being in AZ. The broth actually has a flavor, powdered flavor. I didnt like the pork tho. Their ramen includes a spinach, a welcome difference/change and I liked it.  My biggest pet peeve from a \"ramen house,\" is when they use disposable chopsticks and plastic bowls!!!! And yes, Republic Ramen is guilty of these.  If youre expecting an authentic ramen from this place, you might just as well be disappointed.  Another employee gave me the thai tea for free, because someone forgot to prepare one for me.

The noodles were what was most mediocre in my mind - they were a little chewy and definitely weren't as good as Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe's.

The ramen was okay, I'll have to say I've had better with more options.   But then I remember this is Arizona and we have pretty much nothing when it comes to food like this.  The guy who took my order was really friendly and very enthusiastic when it came to answering our questions. The only thing missing was screaming \"Irrashaimase!\" when people walked in. Lol. I had ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and like others have said, the broth was pretty weaksauce when I compared it to Cherryblossom. It felt lacking, but it still had flavor. For some people it might be a little salty but I can see why there are lots of veggies in the soup, balances the flavor out.  My boyfriend had the Republic and he said it was pretty spicy, but his soup was a little lackluster for his tastes.  My little brother and sister enjoyed their tonkatsu meals but didn't like the mass of vegetables in their way of noodle paradise. Haha. All in all it was a nice experience. Quite a drive for some ramen though. We didn't wait too long for our boba drinks either. Probably because it wasn't that busy.   I will be returning. :)",

At least our food was quickly brought to our table.  There's only one vegetarian option on the menu, which is not ideal.  It was OK, but it seemed like there were an awful lot of bean sprouts in it and not as many noodles as I would have liked.  I quickly finished the noodles and was left with a bowl full of broth and sprouts.  There were just a few small slices of tofu...disappointing for sure.  We also ordered a smoothie, and we waited about 25 minutes for it, longer than it took us to finish our meal.  We ended up taking it with us.  They said it took so long because it took a long time to make the boba, but we ordered ours without boba, and I guess it didn't occur to them to make ours first since they could do it right away.  The restaurant was clean and the food was pretty good, but overall not a satisfying experience.  I'll probably try it again when they've had longer to get their act together.",

Hard boiled egg would be ok if it where multiple small slices but if you're going to halve it, it had better be soft boiled so it disperses throughout the broth, not just two large dry solid pieces. For all I know this is not typical quality. I only visited once. But you know what they say... you never get a second chance to make a first impression.. and the most important thing restaurant needs to get right is consistency. It has to be good every time.  Unfortunately I live in Tucson and am not willing to travel again to have another mediocre experience. So I'll pass on Republic Ramen. For comparison I find Ikkyu's Tonkatsu ramen on Orange Grove to be better although a bit less extravagant with their toppings. Sachiko Sushi on Valencia also has a better Sukiyaki ramen. Oh well, the search for truly great Ramen is still on. Please message me with suggestions for Ramen in AZ, particularly in Tucson.",

    "text": "First I will admit to not being a very impartial critic here-I absolutely adore a good bowl of ramen.  Although I've not been to Japan I've been fortunate enough to visit some outstanding ramen houses in Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Jose. While I think this is probably some of the better ramen I've had in Arizona, unfortunately that's not really saying much.  It was okay, not great. I ordered the miso ramen with chashu hoping against hope that I'd have a reasonable facsimilie to Santouka's spicy miso available in the Mitsuwa stores around the country-drool.....  The noodles were decent, though I wish there was more of them.  The broth was not very miso-y and lacked the depth that really makes the ramen bowl.  The chashu was really the weak point, sliced thin pork with no real discernable chashu quality.  The accompanying vegetables were fine although I wouldn't say it's what I'm used to/looking for. In short I'd say this is Americanized ramen-and no, not the cheap junk from the package but suited more for an American palate instead of leaning toward authenticity.  No fish cake or bamboo shoots, none of the cloudy unctuous broth, no pork belly chashu. The place looks great and the staff is great, I wouldn't dismiss it but Republic doesn't get a fervent recommendation either.",

The ramen and the seaweed salad were both good as was the sno, though I doubt I would go out of my way to order it again. The boba was just bad and the gyoza was so salty you couldn't really taste anything else. The couple of people we dealt with at the counter were nice and answered all our questions. I would definitely go back for the ramen but I'd probably stick with just that.",

They gave me a lame excuse something about a printer. You would think that the front cashiers would see no food going out and would of caught the problem right away instead of waiting around for 20 or 30 minutes. Finally got back to my room with my ordered (Tokyo ramen noodles and the shrimp tempura) It was only a two minute walk and the shrimp tempura was cold and Soggy and the soup was not what I expected. I've had better ramen noodles from a grocery store do-it-yourself pack. Maybe the only good thing was the fresh veggies that came with it",

I ordered the republic ramen- traditional topping and oh boy! It was not as good as I expected! The ramen size was excellent; however, the taste, the flavor was okay- I would say passable. Simply disappointing.   I was also excited to try their boba drink and let me tell you, it was one of the worst I have tasted! I have tried many, many boba milk tea from different locations and restaurants and this one was one of the worst! Honestly, the only good thing that I had was the seaweed salad which was very good, but again, you can just go buy a seaweed salad done exactly the same way at the Asian supermarkets. Overall, not very impressed... at all! Probably won't be coming back anytime soon.",

    "text": "It used to be this was a five star place to eat for me, it just seems I had not reviewed yet. Well, this is my review now. This place is no longer as great as it used to be sadly. Here's my reasoning as to why.  Yesterday we went to eat there in a large group of seven, this has never been an issue and wasn't last night. The issue began when I ordered Miso Ramen to be vegan, something that I have done for the past 2 years that we have been going to this place. Apparently now they put pork in the base, something I was just informed of last night. In addition, it seems that they put pork in all but the vegetarian and Shiso ramen. This was very disappointing not only to me, my family who also has vegetarian members, but also those in my group who cannot eat pork for religious purposes. Their udon dishes all have fish sauce, but that is nothing new.   The girl taking our order was kind enough to inform us of this, but ended up getting more and more irritated as we were trying to figure out what we could eat and what we wanted to do. We figured out what we could eat, ordered and sat down to wait. The food came and all was going well until my sister, one of the groups vegetarians, discovered meat in her food. She returned the bowl and explained why she needed a new one made.   The one who made the second bowl was a waitress that I have seen there for the past two years I have been going. She's a little below average height, dark hair, wears glasses and I believe her name is Karina. She's great. Always friendly with amazing customer service. She made up the second bowl and the rest of the night went smooth. That was until the waitress that took our order decided to complain about us, very visibly pointing at our table while she spoke. This girl would not give us her name, but she was short and the few times I have seen her she has worn a messy bun for her hair. She also has a poor attitude it seems. Pity.  Suffice to say we will not be returning after being long time regulars. It is a shame because we really did like this place. Unfortunately we do not appreciate poor customer service and getting sick off of the food because of \"the necessity of pork/meat for flavor\". I thank all the other waiters and waitresses who have been amazing to us over our time eating there. We will no longer be returning, but we hope that they will once more become a happier, more vegetarian friendly place again.",

Bottom line, this place is for people that had never experienced excellent ramen other than the package ramen at the store. This place just puts a lot of sodium in your broth and then gives you hot sauce too to cover up the bland taste.   I have eaten ramen in Japan and California, and this place can't compare. But if YOU have never eaten authentic ramen bowls in Asia or California, then YOU may like this ramen. Oh... this place isn't even run by anyone that is Japanese. Contrary to what their shirts say, THEY DON\"T KNOW RAMEN.  And the prices at actually kind of high for it's mediocre quality. If you are in AZ and want some authentic ramen, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe. They are not a ramen restaurant but they do serve a couple of different ramen bowls. You'll notice the drastic difference.",

Given the taste, it's good but it's not great.  The tonkotsu broth has the characteristic richness and savory flavors, but it tasted a bit watery to me. The pork was excellent but the cuts were somewhat lean, missing the rich fattiness I had come to associate with meat in ramen. The veggies were solid and the noodles, most likely store bought, worked well in the dish. I'm a big fan of egg so I got the extra add on, but unfortunately it was cold and hard boiled, not sure if I would do it again.  If you're craving some Asian soup and want a change of pace from pho, Republic Ramen is good for that. It's a decent joint, but since I'm from an area saturated with ramen joints, I'm not sure if I'd come here alone. Would definitely recommend for parties trying something new.",

I was very very tastee...The pork I added was not memorable,  but that was my focus either my main concern was the noodles( plentiful) and broth( hot & yummy )....When I go back later this week I will be ordering this again, but without meat nothing personal but when are we going up we ate Ramen all the time without meat it was just a bonus. Oh yea I had them to removed the bean sprouts and next time NO SPINACH. This is a must try anytime you come to Tempe, Arizona.",

Neither of the people at the counter seemed very knowledgeable, I wasn't expecting a history lesson in ramen, but at the very least tell me a little more than \"pork broth\" when I ask what's in a soup, or some idea of what Boba is. Previously, the only ramen restaurant I had ever visited was The Ramen House in Sacramento, California- and that place was DIVINE. Their ramen was beyond perfection, so my standards were high.  This place did not meet my expectations. The bench seats were wood, and very high up to the table. Was not comfortable. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen, pork. The pork was dried out, and I realised when I got my soup that it did not come with a soy egg. That's actually extra, I was shocked to find out. The bowl portion however was huge and the noodles perfectly made. The broth was delicious, not too salty.   I would come back here,  only because I don't know of any other ramen places near Chandler that I could try. Overall it wasn't terrible but definitely not great.",

I came here today with 3 of my classmates (Julie, Angela, and Natalie) and we were definitely pleased with our orders!   We got: Ramen Republic Garlic Chicken  Boba: Taro, Honey Dew, Black, and Thai  The Ramen Republic was very flavorful! No need to add Siracha! The portions are huge enough that it's easy to split between two people. The Garlic Chicken Ramen was also so tasty! Its not spicy, but you can tell there's a million mouth watering flavors there.   The boba here redeems my previous thoughts about boba in the area. The balls were freshly made, moist, soft, and the kind that melts in your mouth. The milk tea boba was also well prepared! It didn't have that cheap boba taste that's watered down. It's very rich and just the way I like my boba!   Alex, the guy that took our orders was very helpful and friendly. We also got nice discount coupons so I will be returning for sure!",

I ordered the tonkotsu pork belly with an egg traditional style, as well as edamame and gyozas to share.  The appetizers were cooked well and the best part of the meal.  When the huge bowls were ready, I realized that they gave me the modern version of ramen instead of what I ordered.  The sulky girl behind the counter who took my order originally was not what I wanted to deal with again so I went with it.  There was no depth to the broth and the noodles were not ramen noodles as they were soft and kind of slimy.  The store bought packaged kind is better.  Where was the milky broth made rich and unctuous by hours upon hours of slowly simmered pork bones?  This was a poor introduction to ramen for my friend who never had it before.  I couldn't even eat half of it because it was not good and bland.  When we went to get to go containers since I hate to waste food, the same unhelpful girl asked why we needed two...really?",

They are very vegetarian-friendly. However, sometimes the staff you order from don't understand the concept of vegetarianism. We ordered our dishes with vegetable broth and specifically asked for no fish or fish sauce, yet when my dad ordered the kimchi appetizer they failed to tell us that it's soaked in fish oil. That's happened a couple of times--now we just make sure to ask about EVERYTHING. The portions are HUGE! Which is a plus for me (lunch for the next day is ALWAYS a plus).  The service can be good and can be bad, as previously mentioned. Some are very nice, but some just don't seem to \"get it\" (especially with the vegetarian thing).  The tables have a tendencies to be sticky or messy--I don't think they're cleaned too often between customers.  The water cups are TINY. That gets a little inconvenient. I started asking for two.  The atmosphere is nice, but a little loud on the music. We always eat in the back corner because it's quieter. It's always busy.  Anyway, overall I like this place and would like to keep returning! It has a few details that are rough-around-the-edges, but nothing that can't be worked around!",

The udon was so salty, (the broth was so dark we couldn't even see the udon in it); we asked if we can switch it to a republic ramen. When the republic ramen came out, it was so bland and it just tasted like bean sprouts and carrots (which was the toppings on the ramen). The broth in our tonkotsu ramen was salty as well. We were only able to finish a quarter of our food because it was that bad! My son was hungry still so he really wanted to get a boba drink. It took them close to 15 mins to get us the boba; and man, it was so gross.... I was in shock and in disbelief how horrible the food and drink ended up being... the only positive experience was the staff that was nice despite being stressed out with the amount of customers coming in. They seem stressed, yes, but you can tell they were trying. I'm just so upset that we paid for dinner that was this bad. I NEVER had such a bad food experience like this before EVER... sorry republic, never again.",

The chicken was just chopped boiled chicken, the pork and beef weren't any better. They forgot my boyfriends extra toppings and were very unhelpful, then took 15 minutes to get the side of char Sui pork...which was not char Sui by definition. It looked very unappetizing. Another issue is that they only have crummy little plastic spoons which are impossible to eat a large bowl of soup with. We both ended up eating little of our broth because of the small spoons. A ramen place should have the large soup spoons. Also, my boba drink came out luke warm and watered down. We REALLY wanted to like this place, but it fell so short of great ramen.",

    "text": "I have visited Republic of Ramen a second time, I was told by a friend that there was a change in management and that the overall food quality has improved. However, she is greatly mistaken.  The last time I visited, I found my tongue to be numb after the experience, I thought it was excessive use of MSG. This time, I realized, that might not have been the only case. The broth is so salty I couldn't taste the nuances of the dashi stock, if that's the stock they use. I tried adding two cups of water into the broth to dilute it out to figure out what was in the broth, but it was still too salty.  I ordered: Shoyu Ramen (traditional) chicken with extra egg, noodles, extra chicken and extra pork Shio Ramen (traditional) beef Tip: 15%  Bill: $19.47 + tip = $22.39  To say that this place is salty would be incorrect. This place uses a 'dangerous' amount of salt in my opinion. Some people say that ramen should be slurped. Well I didn't slurp the ramen, but my lips felt like a layer had been removed/dried and cured after the meal. I thought I was the only one, my companion agreed with me as well, and she uses a shoot load of salt in her cooking.  All in all, there isn't much to comment about this place, it's 'Asian Hip' in ambiance, it had a friendly sort of staff, the sake is from a box and the ramen is salty as hell (I never use hell but it deserves it here). Oh did I add, we both got food poisoning even though they received a mark of A on cleanliness?",

My fiance & I got the Sapporo ramen, I got traditional toppings & he got the original. I actually think the concept is clever, picking your toppings-- like someone else had said, similar to Chipotle but a ramen joint...  You have to know what tastes mesh well together though, & because of the Chipotle-esque atmosphere-- unless you know what your doing, I don't think you should expect a ton of recommendations.  Food came out quickly, as to be expected in this type of atmosphere, & the portion was a good size.  This place was recommended by a friend & I do have to say, it exceeded my expectations. Will be going back, especially for Snow Boba! :)",

You have the standard tonkotsu (pork marrow), miso, and shoyu (soy sauce) broths with some nice variants of these standards.  They're all tasty and you have a nice variety of traditional and not so traditional add-ins.  I found the restaurant to have a nice, \"good enough\" decor, though they lose a star due to the dirty bathrooms.  The management really needs to implement a more regular bathroom cleaning schedule.

    "text": "Republic Ramen had some potential, but fell short of a decent ramen experience. The counter-service eatery offers a number of vegetarian broths and bubble tea for a college town food experience. And I mean the affordable, could-be-great, but likely disappointing eating experience that is endemic of the college experience.   It took almost thirty minutes to be served.  The edamame was disappointing. I hate to say this, but it reminded me of taking frozen edamame out of my freezer and attempting the microwave instructions for the first time.  I had the chili pepper ramen. I enjoyed the noodles and broth enough, though the dish wasn't spicy. The vegetables were not so great. They felt completely out of place, like someone had accidentally poured soup into a bowl already filled with salad. The picture says it all. Fortunately, the meal was cheap.   The restaurant didn't seem clean, from the floors to the table surfaces. I grabbed a spoon from the central spoon repository and found it to be wet. I was hoping it was wet from washing. Even if that were True, it wasn't pleasant.  I'm still looking for a great bowl of ramen in Phoenix. Republic Ramen had plenty of business. I wonder if there are other options, or folks accept Republic Ramen for what it is: an affordable restaurant capitalizing on the young people's ramen craze.",

To start, this is a walk-up and order restaurant, not wait-staffed. Ok. No big deal.  I asked what the house special was and they suggested: Tonkotsu Ramen Rich pork flavored broth. Original Toppings Fresh spinach  Sprouts  Scallions Carrots  Traditional Toppings Men-ma  Bamboo shoots  Nori  Naruto Scallions    The broth was just ho-hum. I added some soy and sriacha to spice it up, but still, nothing great about it. Just average.   Noodles - fresh straight from a bag, not made here. Toppings - just sad and boring. No egg. I haven't ever had carrots or spinach on Ramen before.. but these are just bland and sad.  What I couldn't get over was how dirty the floors were. I get they are travertine and all the dirt is in the imperfections, but the baseboards, floors, everything is just really dirty and dingy. Nope. Won't be going back.",

    "text": "We used to have a good experience at Republic Ramen until August last year. The employees have all changed, and so has the atmosphere. I wanted to get the miso ramen with original toppings, replace the carrots and scallions with naruto. The cashier said he can't do that because Naruto is a fish product, so he would have to charge me $1. The traditional toppings which include naruto are the same price. No logic whatsoever. I tried to point that out and he got defensive, \" take it up with the owner, I just do what I'm told\". Ahh, classic college kid mentality to just do what they're told in their safe spaces    Another issue is it's grungy in here, and not in the 90s grunge rock Nirvana kind of way. The floors were sticky, the kids chairs were (all 4 of them) filthy and it wasn't even busy when we went last August. I was there with my family. So to top it off, they start playing rap/hip hop with a lot of swearing and sexual references in it. I know ASU is close by, but that's unprofessional, and not how you should run a business.  Hopefully they'll turn this around because I generally enjoy the food here.",

The staff were all very friendly and restaurant was clean. No complaints there. I was a little disappointed when I got home and saw the vegetable tempura only contained 3 pieces. For $4.50 it was definitely not worth it.  The ramen was good. I haven't tried many places but I really liked the broth. They separate out the noodles and broth when you get it to-go, which I liked a lot. (Great for leftovers!) They give you huge portions with the ramen but my complaint here was that they don't give you a lot of tofu (or protein). Overall, I would come back but be open to trying new dishes.",

I asked him then what the difference was between a snow and a slushy? He told me that a snow just had more Ice. The guy was no help and wouldn't remake it.

The ramen is so thick and so good, the soup is delicious, and the ingredients are amazing. I usually get the miso ramen bc it's so good and simple for maybe starters.",

We ordered the Miso and Tonkotsu soup with traditional toppings to go.  The amount of broth, noodles and toppings are a lot and for a good price. We had to break out our bigger bowls but were not complaining! As we began eating, we continued to be happy with our food selection. The soups were delicious and nutritious. You could taste the freshness of all of the ingredients.  We have continued to go to this restaurant whenever we had a taste for ramen and it will continue to be our go-to ramen restaurant in the future!",

    "text": "I came in to Ramen Republic just past 8pm the other day to order a boba drink. I have been there before and find their ramen okaaay, but on Tuesday I only wanted to grab a drink on my way home. I quickly looked up their restaurant hours and when I saw that they closed at 9pm I knew I had more than enough time. After all, it was only 8:10 or so.   When I walked in and approached the boba menu (which is off to the side a bit), the girl at the counter said nothing to me. Not even a greeting. After making a mental selection on which flavor I wanted to get, I got in line behind a group of four friends, who I assumed were about to order since they were all standing in front of the register. I was standing for quite a few minutes minding my own business before I finally realized they weren't ordering at all! They were all chatting with the cashier who was loudly complaining to them about how customers will often stay in the restaurant past close, and how it drives her crazy because she has much more important things to do and thats she's in medical school and blah blah blah. The girl was literally ranting. At this point there is at least one other costumer who has gotten in line behind me, and two additional girls walk in and approach the boba menu. She calls over to them \"The boba machine is closed.\" and when they asked why she said in a matter-of-fact tone, \"It closes an hour before the kitchen.\" turns her head back to the group of guys talking to her and rolls her eyes. Why couldn't she have mentioned that to me when I walked in?! She HAD to have seen me leaning over to read the boba menu? I left, highly agitated that I wasted so much time waiting in \"line\" to order a drink she would have refused to prepare anyway. When a restaurant posts it's hours, I have to assume all menu items will be available unless otherwise specified, and the rule about the boba machine is not stated anywhere online or in store. In fact, I think the girl working was just lying so she didn't have to stay late to clean the machine. Either way, I was so off-put by the service that I will not be returning.",

I should have said something before I paid because the price didn't add up, but whatever, that's kind of on me.  I thought the broth was very good.  The soba was pretty good.  My bowl was humongous, inappropriately so. I left half of the broth after finishing my noodles and everything else.  If there was \"extra pork\" then it must be pretty skimpy on the reg., or they just gave me the regular amount and charged me for extra.  For a regular portion it was fine.  I really just wanted more noodles to go with the sea of broth.  The place seemed super clean.  The clientele seemed like the sort you'd see in a Stuff White People Like blog post.

Usually I call and place a to go order, if I am lucky and get through their ridiculous phone system, AND lucky enough to have someone actually answer I am able to place my order. Picking my order up is always a chore....  When you arrive there is usually a line, the amazing part is that you have to wait through this line even for a to go order. After waiting about fifteen minutes you can pick up your order and get out of there. The system that they use to place orders is inefficient and its ridiculous how long it takes. If you're lucky enough to show up around 6PM then you should be prepared to wait a considerable amount of time to order and get your food.   If you're a fan of Boba, don't plan on their machine working, ever! I've attempted to order it on several occasions and the machine is always down. I don't know if it is the machine or the employees just being lazy but it's pretty awful.   If you're not a fan of fish then you should avoid the Republic Ramen as it tastes like fish even though there isn't any in it.  In my opinion the best thing on the menu is the Tokyo Ramen with Beef. If you're able to go during off peak times, aren't craving Boba and good dealing with inefficient service then you should be okay.",

When the noodles came they had a little pellets call fishcakes on top.  I asked the server what kind of fish was it. I'm allergic to shrimp. I ask her to check. She went in the back came back and said she read the ingredients and said it had no shrimp but didn't seem as sure of herself. So I said as a precaution I asked her to take it back and remake it without the fish pellets on top.  The soup came back fairly quickly so that was impressive until I started eating and in the bottom was one of the little fish pellets still floating around. Looks like to me they went to the back and just took them off. Wow! I was so upset considering the whole purpose was to have it remade in the event it did have a shellfish type fish in it. My boyfriend was super upset and completely turned off. He felt like that was pretty dangerous considering had I accidentally eaten it and he it did have some type of shellfish in it and I had a reaction it would've been bad. Guess someone should talk to this restaurant about not taking a chance with someone and how an allergy reaction it's so dangerous. Wouldn't be good to have an ambulance pulling up to the front of your restaurant because you were too lazy to remake a bowl of Udon noodles",

It's not a sit down restaurant, you walk in and there's a counter right in front of you with a decent-sized menu displayed from behind. Be sure to know your Japanese cuisine terms or you'll have no idea what the noodle toppings are.   I ordered Tokyo Ramen, which was \"light and spicy\" and had it with beef and the Traditional Toppings. There was one person ahead of me, but our food came out at the same time, it took about ten minutes (not too bad). I wasn't thoroughly impressed, but I finished half of it - the bowl is HUGE by the way. I wouldn't get the beef because if you let it sit in the hot broth, it'll eventually get tougher, but its flavor seeps into the soup. I did have to add some Sriracha sauce to give it an extra kick.  Other than the food, there is also a variety of boba milk tea. I ordered the Thai milk tea, and it was great!  Overall, my experience could have been better, but it wasn't awful. I'll definitely come back sometime and have to try the udon.",

Maybe they have improved since first opening? Anyways I had the tonkatsu with traditional toppings and an egg. Pros- rich yummy porky broth, perfectly chewy noodles, bomb bamboo shoots and naruto! ( the little swirls make me so happy ) cons- pork could be more tender and the egg was NOT a proper ramen egg. It should have a soft medium yolk not a dry crumbly yolk.

    "text": "I LOVE Republic Ramen. I have been holding my birthday and friends' surprise birthday parties here now for a couple of years, because the food is delicious and inexpensive, the staff are very nice, and among my friends and I, we all just love ramen. My typical order is a tonkotsu ramen (very rich, creamy pork broth) and a thai iced tea boba! It is absolutely delicious, and even while writing this review, I am now craving some ramen from here. I have tried to recreate their tonkotsu broth at my home with no such luck! It is simply the best from here!  Also, for me personally, Cherry Blossum cafe was not nearly as good as Republic Ramen, it was just not as satisfying in the broth. I know everyone is different, but that is just my two cents! I will continue recommend Republic Ramen to all of my friends!",

Staff was more focused on sweeping/mopping the kitchen/floors behind the counter than to greet my group and direct us how the restaurant works and where we go. (You order and pay first and seat yourselves.)  When odrdering, the girl in a chefs jacket wasn't very knowledgeable about the specifics of each Ramen dish.   I say this mainly because I had ordered extra pork and charsiu (Chinese BBQ pork) and when my bowl came out there wasn't any hint of it and I was told again, that it's in there, just a different cut of meat.   In my bowl there was just gray pieces of pork. No telltale red of the charsiu.  The place was also extremely dirty. Trash all over the floors, unbussed tables, tables that had been cleared had food debris/broth in the surfaces.",

What I found most off-putting from my first couple of visits, though, was the service! I sincerely value good service, and good service wasn't what my friends and I received at Republic Ramen.  To play devil's advocate, I usually do go to Republic Ramen with rather large groups of friends. I can see how this can get to be overwhelming, with 15+ hungry adults placing orders and demanding food right away. I just felt like some of the staff could have been nicer/less rude/more attentive?  The food was also...okay. I didn't think they were particularly memorable dishes in any way. Same goes for the boba tea shop next door (which is part of the same restaurant, I believe).  I might give Republic Ramen another shot--this is one of the closer ramen shops in my area, so I definitely want to give it anther go. I do hope the experience is more enjoyable this time around.",

    "text": "I barehand a slim slice of the melt in your mouth beef from the mound and dip it in sriracha sauce, devouring it in one bite. I prefer the traditional toppings. Nori seaweed, a root veggie I can't identify, Naruto (kage bunshin no tasty!) and plenty of scallions. Get an egg upgrade because they offer high-end brown eggs, the egg yolk ups the ante for richness in your broth and compliments the salty undertones.  A number of other yelpers fault RR for being too salty; yet they fail to realise salt is a key component of a well executed ramen. You can also balance it out with sriracha sauce. All toppings have been fresh, the broth is always piping hot. There is a lot going on yet everything compliments each other. There is diversity between each bite using your spoon for customization. Even with the restaurant 2/3rds full my ramen came to me in just over 5 minutes.  I'm 6'4 280 and its a challenge for me to take down these portions making RR an insanely strong value. You're looking at between $7-9 for your ramen plus a delicious egg.  Only one gripe. Make the courtesy water cup size bigger, its kinda annoying considering that this food does have high salt content and I can maybe get 3ish sips before its empty. I may bring in my BPA free water jug so this is no longer an issue but I don't want to start a confrontation.",

I had their special ramen with beef and it wasn't bad at all. The broth was spicy but good and on a cold night when I was craving soup it  hit the spot. The reason that this place is just 3 stars and I probably won't be returning except for rare occasions is because it really was just ramen. You get a few slices of beef (and there are a few other options) on top but it really wasn't enough in my opinion to justify  the price and also, getting so much broth you would expect a little more beef than you get. Really, its ramen... I could go buy 90 packs in the store for $9 so if I'm going to pay that for one serving please throw in a little more meat.  I do feel like eating in here might be a little better since they give you a huge bowl and the presentation is a little better than taking it home (broth in one bowl, noodles in another, beef on top of noodles cold). I could possibly come back but it would probably be a similar situation as the last time, cold night and in the mood for ramen.",
