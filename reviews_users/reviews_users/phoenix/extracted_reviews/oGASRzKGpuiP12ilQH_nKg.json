The strudel was amazing.",

    "text": "Given the dearth of German restaurants in the greater Phx area, this is about as good as it gets.  Had the sausage sampler.  The krakauer wurst was pretty unique.  The bratwurst was good too, but brats usually have a pretty low bar to clear to be good.  Had the Schweizer Schnitzel as a main course.  Very good.  The meal came with a cup of soup of the day, which in this case was mushroom.  Very good.  You can't eat ambiance/decor so I generally don't care about things like that but if the owners have a spare dollar or two they may want to paint the place and replace the drop ceiling.  Neither of those things will keep me away but they may want to look into those things.",

The service is always friendly, the food is always good, and the beer is always large :)  My brother-in-law and I like to come here and eat some good food and have a nice large cold beer. The pretzel is always crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I personally love the Chicken Schniztel with the Mushroom sauce. The Apple Streudel and and Bread Pudding are really amazing. The Lentil soup literally tastes like the way my grandmother used to make it (not to sound corny, but it's True).   My favorite beer is the Franziskaner Wiessbeer which I did not see last time, but they have the \"Dunkel\" version of it which is good, it's just darker. I also really enjoy the Spaten Optimator.  Between the great staff, food, and beer, can't go wrong!   p.s. make sure you wear stretchy pants, because after just the pretzel and the bit jug of beer you'll need to stretch out a bit.....",

    "text": "We live in Queen Creek,  but were at Gila River arena for an afternoon concert, and were looking forward to having dinner afterward at Haus Murphy's,  as it's been years since we were there.  It was around 6pm when we arrived and were seated out on the patio (6 in our party).  Although it was chilly out that night,  they have many outdoor heaters which made dining outside quite comfortable.   The patio area was comfortable, but there were a few tables that were pretty loud, so the atmosphere felt more like a college bar hangout vs a family friendly environment.  When ordering drinks,  my husband and I found they were out of our first choice so we settled on something else.   For dinner,  it was jager schnitzel, soft pretzel with cheese spread for the table, and I ordered the patato pancakes as my meal.  There were 4 others in our party and they ordered bolognese, and more jager snitzels.  Expect to enjoy a beverage or two before your meal arrives.   Or in my case, doesn't arrive.  We were served, minus the pretzel and the potato pancakes.  Eventually,  the pc's arrived, but without sour cream since they were out of it,  but didn't mention it when I ordered.    And the pretzel made it,  but no cheese spread- no explanation. The others in my party were underwhelmed with the flavors of the jager snitzel.  In observing the bill,  we found we were over charged for one of our beers, which was promptly corrected, and we weren't charged for the pretzel and the potato pancakes.  We didn't ask for it to be comped,  so it was nice that they took care of it.",

Chicken Schniztel was really, really bland and dry and the sauce was a little greasy. Service was adequate but didn't leave me with any warm and fuzzy feelings (and my glass was empty for a while and I was never offered a refill...that's never good.)   The worst part, however, was that we felt we were being pressured to finish up and leave by the server. The restaurant was not that busy and this--on top of the lukewarm service to begin with--made it a \"meh\" and not an \"a-okay\".   We might go back someday for a beer and pretzel but I doubt it.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went here a few weeks ago.  I had raved and raved about this place to her because every single time I had been there before, it was one of the best meals I have had in Glendale.  But boy, was this last go around a real kick to the groin.  Meal:  I had the pork schnitzel and the potato pancakes.  My fiance, who is a vegetarian, couldn't get anything except for the potato pancakes because they had a scaled down menu during the holiday season. Seriously?  After I called to get reservations and check the websites, you would have figured that they would have mentioned something about a smaller menu than what is typical.  Taste:  Out of all my meals at Haus Murphy's, this was by far the worse.  My food was cold, bland, and they didn't have my favorite beer on tap like they typically do.  Again- scaled down menu.  I got the impression that at least during the holiday season they just pre-cook everything well in advance and just microwave it when ordered.  4 out of 10.  Value:  When I used to go to Haus Murphy, I never got really worked up about value because the good was always good and it was so different compared to most places in Phoenix.  But this time around, given that the menu was compacted and the food wasn't very good, I would the the overall value of my last experience was pretty poor.  2 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  Beyond the menu issue, our serve was pretty decent.  She was polite and friendly.  She didn't go above and beyond but at least she wasn't ruin.  But again . . . the shorten menu . . . that's what really hurts the score this time.  4 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is always fun here.  The big steins.  The music.  Everyone is dressed up.  4 out of 5.  Overall:  I will give Haus Murhpy's one more try and hopefully they will earn back their typical 5 start performance.  14 out of 30 points, 1 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "Quantity over quality.  Split a combo for 2 with the wife - was a HUGE heaping plate of meat and we walked out with plenty of leftovers.  Good but not great - schnitzel was soggy and sausages came out lukewarm like they're just sitting in a giant, greasy tub in the kitchen to be tonged out en masse.  I liked their mustards - just the right amount of flavor and not over powering, helped make up for the flat taste of the sausages.  Overall, the place has a nice atmosphere with an old town bar feel, though it does have a weird stale smell when you first walk in.  Band on Friday a nice touch, but a bit repetitive.  Table next to the us got a giant pretzel that looked pretty awesome - I'd come back for that and a German beer.  I'd rate this place 4 stars as a bar, but only 3 as a restaurant.",

I ordered the Kilometer sausage which came with a soup, 2 really long sausages, potatoes, and sauerkraut. Although it didn't look familiar, the flavor reminded me of sausage I could buy in a pack of 6 at the grocery store. The potatoes were also lacking flavor and I realized I don't think I like sauerkraut; ultimately the soup was my favorite part which was pumpkin for that day. It was interesting to see pumpkin as savory rather than sweet and I enjoyed it. The staff was really nice and while I don't think this is a bad restaurant, I just don't think it is fit for my taste.",

It created a little bit of havoc for the server and it made service a little slow, but I will cut them some slack.  I ordered the pretzel, because I am a carb addict.  I was so happy we had such a big group, because after cutting a piece I could pass it around to share and not feel so guilty.  It was big enough that about 10 people were able to taste it.  I really liked it.  The spicy mustard was indeed spicy. Before our dinners we got split pea soup, it was very tasty, I am usually not a soup person, but I was hungry and I enjoyed it very much.  For my entree I ordered the Wiener Schitzel, I had not had baby cow in a long time, it was well worth it.  I ate only have of it and took home the rest.  It came with potatoes and wirsing.   The potatoes were very good, on the other hand, I personally didn't like the wirsing (a creamy cabbage concoction).  Good thing Amy liked it, lol. We ordered dessert, but they were taking so long that we asked to have our Black Forest cake and Cherry Strudel to go.  When I got home, I was trying to be so good and got only a third of the strudel, then gave my hubby a third and put the rest in the fridge.  Well that freaking strudel was amazing, I went back to the fridge and ate the rest.  The next day I went twice to the gym.",

Being a lovely warm and sunny day we decided to sit outside....which is very cool...nicely decorated, big picnic tables and plenty of sunlight.  I ordered the Hackbraten (German Meatloaf) which was very good, the mashed potato and red cabbage were superb! With this I of course had to try a German beer.....I asked the waiter what he would recommend, he asked what type of beer I like and I said usually the darker ones...he recommended the Franziskaner Dunkel - an unfiltered dark wheat beer, dark roasted malt with a smoky roasted grain finish .... a great recommendation as it was just perfect with my meal.  My husband who is constantly craving Weisswurst Sausages was finally at peace having found it on the menu. He insisted I try some of his and said it would melt in my mouth....wow!...it actually does melt in your mouth....delicious.   Our waiter was awesome as he knew everything on the menu so he was very helpful as well as very friendly and a great photographer! Everything you need in a waiter : )  The German music playing in the background was really festive and added to the great atmosphere. We will definitely be back!",

We all have lived in Germany for an extended time and a German dinner for our family and our son's wive and girlfriend so a Christmas eve German dinner has become a tradition.  The year before last the woman who runs the place didn't treat us very well (a party of 6).  We tried again last year and they treated us even more shamefully.  We all decided that our experience with Haus Murphy has come to an end.  It's a shame but each time, the woman has pushed us impatiently to finish and we'd made reservations for 7:00 but none the less the lady did everything but put our order in a box and shove us out the door.  Even something as simple as bread with dinner was with held. Perhaps any other time of the year but not on Christmas eve.  If they don't want customers on the 24th, they should just close for the day.",

Our wives ordered Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel, and of all things the gnocchi, which was pretty darn good. I would love to go back tho this place, the ambiance and the service were great, and the food was amazing in my opinion.  The topper of it all was the ice cold authentic German beer on tap. 3 kinds of Spaten, Weihenstephan Hefeweizen, Warsteiner, and others. They actually have a beirgarten or beer garden to sit outside and drink in, It was summer when we went so the 109 degree heat at 7:00 kept us inside. If you are in town, give it a try, Near the Cardinals stadium, would be great for after game celebration.",

    "text": "My husband, my 14 month old and I went here Friday for the chocolate festival. I'd been there a few years before and remembered I didn't like it but couldn't remember why so I thought Id give it another try. I loved the pumpkin soup and the brie but the other food was just decent and we had horrible service. I had to ask 3 times for the heater next to us to be turned on and another 3 times just for silverware. Our waitress had a bad attitude and was flat out rude. She never refilled our drinks and it took over an hour to get our food. I understand when it's busy it's more difficult to focus on tables but she literally never came to our table on her own we had to get up and ask for her or flag her down for everything. The people sharing our table ordered the $5 beers and the waitress didn't even tell them the restaurant was out she just gave them beers that were $3 more a piece like they wouldn't even notice it on the bill. When they confronted her she rolled her eyes and treated them like dirt. We really are easy patrons, I've worked in the food industry so I make it a point to be patient and not flip out but seriously this waitress was the worst and it makes me angry that people are out there are struggling to find jobs and this woman has one and performs it horribly. I don't care how bad of a day you are having, when you go to work don't be lazy and rude just do it 100% because if you don't than there is someone out there who deserves that paycheck more than you. Also, and this has nothing to do with the rating, but the waitresses dress in German wear if you can even call it that and our waitress specifically was wearing was wearing an extremely low cut top, something that would give hooters a run for their money and she was practically spilling out, I'm far from a prude but it was distasteful and inappropriate and I shouldn't have to worry when I'm about to eat that my server is about to accidentally flash me. I get it, drunken men are probably going to tip the waitress with her chest falling out of her shirt pretty well but seriously save that kind of attire for a different establishment. I'm giving it one star based on our terrible waitress, the waiter at the table next to us seemed awesome and very attentive. We won't be going there again.",

The food was full of flavor, well seasoned, big servings, prepared well.  The beer was GREAT, I am sorry I can't remember the name of the one we had... It was the dark one, that was light but tasted like a dark :) haha! Hope that helps! I had the schnitzel, a pork one with Swiss and ham... I would not order it again, but not because there was something wrong with it, it just wasn't my thing, I went on the recommendation of the waitress, but I have different taste... The hubby had a sausage, same story as the schnitzel, except he liked it and would order it again.  The pretzel was very good!! The soup was good.  I LOVED the spatzel (noodles).  I stirred in butter and salt and pepper... YUM, I could make a meal out of that and the German potato salad!! and beer and pretzels!!",

Once we looked at the menu, however, we just HAD to order some lunch!  Everything looked so tempting!  We ordered Gulasch mit spatzel, Jager Schnitzel and beer.  Everything was delicious.  Both my parents are German so  I grew up on this type of cuisine.  The meal took me back to dinner at Oma's and Opa's house.  Wonderful comfort food!!  We didn't order dessert because we were really full from our entrees.  I'm looking forward to trying the sauerkraut chocolate cake next time!",

    "text": "I'll be honest, I was NOT thrilled when my husband let me know that his friends from work had chosen this place for dinner. For the most part I think stuff like brats and sausage are GROSS (with the exception of a little hide the sausage. lol) and German food to me just sounded weird with the schnitzels and spatzles and kraut, etc. but I decided I could at least have the cesar salad.  I'm so happy I decided to branch out and try something new.  I had the steak schnitzel (a schnitzel, I learned, is a lean boneless piece of meet ... steak, veal, pork or chicken, breaded and fried) which was covered in a Gorgonzola sauce...it came with a side of German friend potatoes and green beans with bacon/onions.  All of it was very tasty!  I split mine with my hubby and he shared his Schweitzer schnitzel (pork with a layer of ham and swiss cheese) with me.  His came with wirsing which turned out to be a cabbage and cheese dish that sounded awful but tasted great!  The service was wonderful....there were 16 people in our party and we never felt we had to flag anyone down for service.  The place was HUGE but did not appear so from the street and it was completely packed so they must be doing something right! The only thing I'd suggest is that they add a little \"glossary\" to the front of the menu for those of us (pretty much our whole table) who didn't know what the various dishes were.  That would free up the servers for more important stuff than explaining all those crazy names of dishes!!!!  I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",

My friend and I are German, living in America and thought a good old Schnitzel would be a nice blast from the past. We ordered the giant Pretzel which was very good and the beer was very good also. my friend ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and I ordered the Jaeger Schnitzel which is a Pork Schnitzel with a mushroom sauce. The Wiener Schnitzel was so dry and over-fried that he needed 5 Lemon wedges to make this eatable. And my Jaeger Schnitzel was completely burned. Black on the bottom. Not brown but black. The cook must have thought that I would not notice with sauce on top. The Sauce was so thick it was terrible. It tasted like it was some instant powder sauce but since I have not seen the preparation, I can not vouch for that. All in all we left pissed and angry what some people sell as good German food to Americans. I was embarrassed. And how can this be recommended in the show Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins?  OH... The waitress was great. Very nice and attentive.",

Haus Murphy just was plain ole fun tonight  , thanks to two Polka playing  Hawaiian-shirted, German loving musicians and a table  next to us full of celebrationistos  feeling no pain ,  we really enjoyed our time.    The beer was flowing all around us , big mugs , giant mugs, lots of mugs.  Our large family group ordered lots of yummy homey foods  like German Meatloaf , which was rich and seasoned and moistened quite well . My husband and I ordered the giganto platter,the Bauernplatte for two was completely  awesome!  A  great eating challenge for my husband who can put away of truckload of food. This platter had a variety of meats including a wonderful chicken schnitzel, German potatoes, red cabbage , brats in assortment  and sauerkraut that tasted nothing like that stuff from a jar.  We finished off dinner with some moist bread pudding like apple strudel that I thought tasted wonderful . I would love some more right now!!  Low carb diet  be gone!  Beware after such a big meal  1piece of strudel is enough for two people.  Ambiance is  familyish , lots of people , and very fast service.  They have many long tables that serve big groups well. Looks like they are pros at  having a good time. Haus Murphy is a great place to take a family for fun .",

Outdoor biergarten dining with oompah music and fun accordionist  in lederhosen added to the ethnic ambiance. Friend had the Eisbein and the sight of that smoked meat on bone got the whole table drooling and it was succulent and tasty. I shared a Bauerplatte, assortment of sausages, red cabbage, sauerkraut, German fried potatoes, and delicious spaetzle, with my partner and we had enough for another meal at home. They also had some interesting German beers on taps and all of them were good, esp. the Warsteiner.  What would improve the experience? Please, with dinner meals like these in a restaurant like this, you should provide a bread basket while we are waiting for our meals and sipping our beers. What's a few slices of bread, esp. good German brown bread, gonna cost you when it can add such a feeling of hospitality to set the tone for the evening? Charging your customers for that just seems cheap and destroys the mood.  I can understand not wanting waste, but if it's asked for, rest assured it won't be wasted. Honest.",

I wanted the Beef Roulade, and I was asked if I wanted 1 or 2. I said 1, and went about eating my delicious pretzel. Then our (very nice) server came back and informed me that I cannot order 1, due to the way they are prepped and portioned, if I still want the Beef Roulade I must order 2 and pay the extra $4.95 for the second one.   Of course I did because I really wanted it, however this is a horrible practice to enforce bad prep practices on customers. If you can't honestly offer them in singles, take it off the menu and sell them in pairs only.   Also you put your server in an awkward situation which is really super uncool.",

    "text": "This place is really good, lots better than our German place back in Lexington, KY but we are still debating whether it is better than Bayrischer Hof in Cabarete or the Hofbrauhaus in Newport, Kentucky. Either way it's in the same vicinity.(quality wise, obviously as far a way from each other as I have ever traveled)   Started with the huge pretzel which was very warm and fresh. The cheese was pretty good and the horseradish mustard was great.   The beer was really good and toof bustin cold! See previous review if you need a translation!  By this time we backtracked on our original plan of ordering two entrees and decided to split one and add a side of the potatoe pancakes.   We ordered the Guy Fieri recommended Paprika Schnitzel and it did not disappoint! Great flavor and was thicker than your usual schnitzel. It did have a sweet flavor as mentioned by a fellow Yelper but it went really well. We loved it. The potatoe pancakes were absolutely amazing. We ordered a side of there mushroom gravy for comparative purposes and it was amazing. I thought it was the best we had ever had but my wife still favors the mushroom gravy at Bayrischer Hof In Cabarete Dominican Republic (a must try hole in the wall if in Cabarete)  As to the service, probably why I didn't go with a five star. By no means was the service bad but it was a little slow and the waiter was really busy and running from table to table so he was not very friendly. He wasn't rude either just kind of indifferent. No one there was really overly friendly but they were busy. To be clear they were not rude at all. We may have higher expectations of our staff when we eat out. There seemed to be a going through the motion attitude at several places we visited in Arizona. There seems to be more willingness to be genuinely friendly back home. This may not be a fair representation of Arizona since we were only here a short amount of time but it was our impression.  We certainly have experienced the same back home but just not as a usual thing.  Overall, don't let the service deter your visit. We are anxious to return to try more menu items- next time in AZ we will return!!",

We chose bar area to watch the football games. There were three of us but they seated us at a table barely large enough for 2. We tried it out and then chose to reseat ourselves to a larger table. They waiter did not complain or reprimand us so that was good. We ordered our drinks and appetizer since we knew what we wanted. We had to restate our drink order 4 times, once because they were out of the beer we requested another three times because the guy could not remember our request. How difficult is rum and coke, and two waters? We had to repeat our appetizer order twice because he 'wanted to make certain he placed the correct order.' While waiting to place our entre order, we were trying to watch the football game but 2 of the waiters were standing in front of the TV watching the game and blocking our view, we asked them twice if they could move to the left just a little bit, they never did move they just continued standing there. For entre we requested steak spatzel but they were out of steak so we finally settled on chicken spatzel. The chicken was very tender and servings were large. We had leftovers. I doubt I will go out of my way to revisit this place during my next visit.",

My coworker and I stopped in for lunch, and I give them 3/5 stars.   I ordered the spicy bratwurst, and asked if it came with a roll. At first the waitress thought I wanted a hot dog bun, so I clarified that I was asking for a Broetchen--she had no clue what that meant. I simplified, and asked if they had a dinner roll they could give me. The rolls that they had available were really soft, not the crusty Broetchen I am used to having with a brat. I was disappointed, but the roll was still okay.   The sauerkraut was spot on--juniper berries and all. I could have easily eaten twice as much had come with the meal. The potatoes were okay, but could have used more seasoning. The bratwurst was absolutely delicious, and paired really well with the spicy and flavorful mustard (I believe horseradish mustard) that was offered.  Service was quick, and my iced tea never ran dry. The waitress was polite and attentive, even during the lunch rush.   The lunch menu didn't have a weisswurst on it, which is my favorite kind of sausage. I also wish their potato pancakes had been available!   I'm going to check out the other German restaurants in Phoenix, but am not against visiting Haus Murphy's again.",

    "text": "Last Thursday I had the pleasure of joining a bunch of Yelpers at a UYE here.  I had not been here in over 10 years and they have move East on Glendale a bit since then.  At that time they were out of sauerbraten so they served us a stew of sorts that wasn't on the menu and I remember it being quite good and large plates of food.  I still desired to try their sauerbraten so that is what I ordered.  It comes with a potato dumpling, gravy, and red cabbage.  I expect a piece of beef marinated for three days to not require a knife to cut and to have some flavor of it's own before dowsing it in gravy, and sauerbraten I have had before met this.  This one to me was quite chewy and the gravy too sweet.  Gravy is one of those things that just because I think it is too sweet doesn't make it bad or improperly made, it just didn't suit my taste.  If I had liked the gravy better it would have improved my image of the dumpling which, without gravy, was sort of tasteless.  The red cabbage was just as I expected and have had before.  Now that I have grumbled about my meal.  I got a bite of a big pretzel two of which the restaurant comped us.  I thought it was a bit salty but overall a very pleasant surprise.  I chose to try mine with butter.  The bread pudding was delicious, I chose the small size and it was easily enough for two to share, but I ate it all anyway. :-)  All of this food was washed down with a good tasting Spaten lager.  The service was pretty good, especially for our large group.  And they were willing to split the checks, which even with a party of about 18 did not have the mandatory added gratuity, although I doubt if anybody in our party tipped less than 18% because they was nothing wrong with the service to warrant a poor tip.  The owner didn't introduce himself but he did make a couple of appearances on the patio to see how things were going.  I could easily be enticed to come back to the patio and enjoy a beer.  I think I would opt for one of the appetizers like a pretzel or the potato pancakes to soak the beer up with.",

The spaetzle which had been my favorite at another German restaurant was a disappointment.  I used the bacon gravy on it.  We had a side of it ($2.50) and the order of it they offer with Swiss cheese and grilled onions on it ($9.99).  You didn't get much more for the extra money.  The sausages with sauerkraut were good.  No room for dessert sadly enough.",

    "text": "Talk about a turn for the worse. Tonight I had the most awful service of my several years of going to Haus Murphy on a regular (at least once a month!) basis. If you read my previous review, you'll see how happy I was up until this point, but that's changed after tonight.   What happened? First the service was slow. Then the service became nonexistent. Were they busy? Not more than normal. Was our server overburdened? Not that I could tell. She was, however, absent minded and uncaring.   Example? Our server brings our drinks and wanders off to other tables, not even asking (or caring, apparently) if we were ready to order at that point, which we of course were. Just plops down the drinks and leaves without a word. What the heck is that?   My wife wants to substitute French fries for the potatoes, which she doesn't care for. We've done this a hundred times before, never ever been a problem. But tonight, with this server? \"Oh there are no substitutions. It's printed on the menu here...\" and she proceeds to point it out to my wife, even though I've just told her we have never had an issue getting it substituted and that we're long time repeat customers. Totally over her head. So she says to my wife, \"Is it okay if they put it on the side?\" referring to the fries. Of course, why wouldn't it be?   So we get our food, fries come as a side order and there was no substitution. Our server later shows up when we're more than half done with our meal and asks if we want refills. I say yes, so she takes both of our drinks and walks off. She never returned with them. About 15 minutes later, after we're both finished eating, she comes by and has the unbelievable nerve to ask how everything is going, oblivious to the fact that there are no drinks on the table at all. I told her, bluntly, that it would have been much better if she'd brought our drinks back before we finished the food. \"Oh, sorry,\" is her only response. She brings the drinks in 10 seconds flat, no follow up apology, no nothing.   Another long delay, then I get the bill. Naturally they charged us extra for the fries rather than substituting. Mind you, she never told me that they would do that. Incensed, I go to the front to complain to a manager. I speak with a manager up there. I explain to said manager about the situation, to which she rudely and flatly responds, \"Yeah that's right, there's no substitutions,\" and gives me this stare like I was babbling nonsense or something. I point out that I was not told we would be charged so she has the server come over and tell me, \"No, I told you, remember? I asked if you were okay having it on the side.\" What?! That's not the same as asking if you can charge me extra. I tell her this, to which she responds, bluntly, \"Well, that's what I meant.\"   I paid the bill and left without giving her any tip at all. I really, really hate to do that, but if you're going to insult my wife's intelligence, take our drinks and not bring them back until we're done eating and then have the gall to refuse removal of a charge you did not tell me about, you're dreaming if you think you're getting a tip.   I cannot begin to put into words just how upset this whole thing has made me. I loved this place, as is obvious from the earlier version of this review. The thought of never going back makes me sick, but so does the way my wife and I got treated tonight. I'm not going back until I get some kind of explanation and an apology from the server and the manager. I did give one of the owners a complete run down of what happened and I'm hoping something will come out of that. Will definitely update this review accordingly as that progresses, but right now they are getting the 1-star they deserve.",

The menu has all the German dishes, so couldn't make up my mind and had to order the Bauer plater with many German specialties. All 4 of us loved the food and had a great time...just like you would at a  guest haus in Germany.",

The ambiance is perfect, (and unless it's in the middle of summer), the weather is perfect too. I can't ever decide so I usually convince someone to split the two-person sampler with me ($36.50). Which honestly can be split with more than two, depending on your appetite. The employees are dressed in authentic style German clothing. We even had a German server, Michael, who was with great spirits with us even though we stayed 10 minutes after close! If you're on the fence about the pretzel, you must get it (with cheese of course)",

So when we had an opportunity to go there, I was thrilled.  We ordered the Reuben and Potato Pancakes to share.  The corned beef so so mouthwatering, I could have just eaten that alone; however, the bread needed to be toasted a little more because it fell apart easily.  I didn't care because it was really tasty.  The potato pancakes were a little larger than my gram used to make, and they were made with onions, but I enjoyed them.  The plate was larger than I expected for an appetizer (not complaining at all), but hated to waste any.  It was served with applesauce and sour cream.  I wish I could have enjoyed the beers there, as they looked good.  I would go back.  Service was fine, no complaints.",

The heavily decorated interior was a bit much for my taste and the loud music made it hard to talk to one another. Our table and menus had that \"sticky diner feel\".   We ordered the giant pretzel with cheese sauce and that was the best part of the meal by far. For dinner I ordered the weiner schnitzel and it was bland and overly greasy. It came with a side of fried German potatoes that were also coated in grease and flavorless. However I will give credit to their sausage. My boyfriend ordered the kilometer and that was phenomenal. I regret not getting the chocolate cake everyone raves about because it looked incredible.    The staff was great and id give them 5 stars for customer service. Id come back to try more of their sausage options just to give it another chance. Maybe German food just isn't for me.",

I have to say, love the location in old town Glendale and rather charming decor with waitresses dressed in traditional German garb like you would see at an Octoberfest in Munich, which occurs in September, not October, but whatever.   As for the food, a bit off from what I've had in Germany - their Schnitzel here came across more like a chicken fried steak and the crust was not as crispy as I've had in Germany (I'm not from there but have visited several times). The one thing I did notice, and I appreciate the German beers on tap, was that the beer tasted just a bit off, and generally that is an indication that the establishment just needs to clean and sanitize their lines for their taps. I'm a home brewer so I may be more picky about this than most but I had my friend try the beer and she noticed the difference as well.   We also had the apple strudel for desert and it was okay - part of the overall German meal experience. For me, charming place, a unique food experience but relative to the prices point I wouldn't say it was the best German meal experience I've had in Phoenix but it was till fun. All I ask, flush out those taps but I would definitely eat here again if I was in the area. :-)",

I am so sad I did not experience this place sooner. When we walked through the door the aromas from the kitchen brought a tear to my eye. I felt like I had gone back in time to grandma's house. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the food was so similar to what grandma made, and the people were kind and friendly!! My husband and I had the Beef Plate for Two and is should be names the Beef Plate for Four.

They love Haus Murphy's but even before I married a German I thought this place tasted bland and couldn't be authentic. After I took my husband there with the fam, he agreed the food was so far from authentic, except for the soup. The only thing I would ever order there is their soup.  Besides for The Spicery (not sure if still open) downtown Glendale's restaurants have really gone downhill. Sad.",

These are must-orders, especially if you arrive hungry. My one complaint was that the kitchen was so slammed that it took an hour for our food to arrive.  Once it did, it didn't last on the table long. We devoured a variety of sausages, schnitzels and potato pancakes. The traditional kraut and red cabbage fit in nicely with the traditional meat-gasm items.  Live polka, good beer and plenty of sausage. You'll swear you left Glendale and actually made it to Munich.",

She also checked in on us enough, but wasn't overly pushy.  We had the sauerkraut puffs to start. I wouldn't say they were puffs, but they were delicious. They seemed more potato based and really heavy. I would still order these with the intention of taking them home for later.  I had the roulade and it was very tender. Still not my mother's cooking, but it will do! The red cabbage to me, was missing something, but it wasn't enough to not eat it. For the life of me I can't remember what my husband ate. I just remember it being a \"spicy braut\", but not the one that was intended to be spicy. Perhaps the wonderful waitress that suggested it to us will do the same.  For desert we had the apple strudel with real cream. It was delicious! You maybe thinking the portions were small, but they weren't. We ended up taking most of it home because there was so much food! I will add pictures.",

It was crunchy and tasted interesting.  I did speak with the waiter and he stated maybe they should have cooked it in the oven for another hour.  Wonderful.  Oh, I have never seen German Potatoes like these either.  Sliced thinly and very greasy with no flavor.  Ended up with an upset stomach.     The main part of the meal was chicken Schnitzel.  It was crunchy with no flavor.  The mushrooms were also not cooked... not a good thing to figure out while eating.  The wine cream sauce was not a wine cream sauce.  Maybe they used the wirsing sauce?  Scrapped off the chicken.  ONLY good part of the meal was the German pretzel.  WE DID NOT get the cheese sauce as it cost extra and we did not get any horseradish mustard as mentioned in a different review.  I am wondering if this restaurant changed management.  I will not recommend or go back.   I am very disappointed to have paid as much as I did to receive such awful food.",

    "text": "SO DON'T GO TO THIS PLACE IN JUNE, JULY OR AUGUST...well any other time too!! I know...I was here on June 26, 2015. The other months will get worse.   The fact that they sat me in a loud room next to the bar under the TV when I requested a quieter area for a meeting I was about to have did not trigger thoughts of a Yelp review.   The fact that they did not have the tables ready for our group that we reserved weeks in advance did not illicit a yelp review.   The fact that they are housed within some sort of cell proof bunker did not trigger thoughts of yelp reviews until my kids were having problems and trying to get help. But when I was on hold getting help for the kids the scheiekopf playing his umpaloomp tuba right behind my head while I was holding on the phone waiting for my drink triggered thoughts of standing up knocking him on his fat rump and beating him with his shiny tootdalou.   The fact that the food was not as good as I anticipated definitely triggered the need for a Yelp review. But I was having fun. I was having my meeting and I didn't have time for that yelping stuff.   But at the middle of the meal when the entire room heated up to about 90+ degrees and everyone at the table was complaining about the heat sweating to death and das fraulein mentions the AC was as cool as it goes and I lost all my appetite because I was getting sick from the heat is the final moment when I had it with this place.   Do you want good German food...check out the places in Mesa. There are several. They are authentic. They have better food. They have better atmospheres. They have ACs. And they don't have a scheiekopf on a tuba being rude to their patrons.   Just say NEIN to this pathetic place...I was there...I know for a fact!!!",

Hubby and I love coming here, we both adore their schnitzel...he likes the chicken and I like the jager (pork loin).  It's always on point, and feels like someone's nana is in the back making each dish that comes out.  We were both commenting on that tonight, it seems so homey and comforting whenever we eat here.  We normally order the pretzel for an appetizer, which comes out fresh and hot (and HUGE) along with a beer cheese dip and spicy mustard dip...so delish!  We didn't get that tonight, just our entrees.  But, the entrees include a cup of soup, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  We did decide to share a dessert (which we don't normally do), and went with the apple streudel.  It's served with a vanilla sauce, ice cream and whipped cream.  The plate was completely empty when we were done.  The service was really good, our server was very friendly and we both enjoyed our dining journey to Germany...until next time...",

Our waiter was super nice and knowledgeable about the menu, including giving a good recommendation on a german beer I had never tried before.  I ended up ordering the schnitzel sandwich and my fiancee had a brat served on pretzel bread.  Both came with a side of fries.    It did take forever to recieve our food (more on that later), but once it arrived it was delicious, including really amazing fries.  The only complaint was the pretzel bun, which transformed from soft and chewy to the consistency of a brick in record time.  While waiting for our food we noticed that several tables near us, who had arrived later, were all halfway through their meals.  Our waiter noticed too and after investigating discovered that the order ticket machine had ate our ticket.  While not a big deal (stuff happens) he apologized and surprised us with a complimentary apple strudel dessert.    Now neither my fiancee or I ever really order dessert but we are both rethinking that now.  The strudel was the absolute best apple dessert thingy I have ever had.",

We enjoyed so very much, after lunch we not only had a ton of leftovers from the more than generous portions, but enjoyed so much we ordered for our daughter and family who we are here visiting from out of state for dinner tonight.  Even  the kiddos LOVED it for dinner and we will most definitely return.  We love to visit places featured on Diners Drive Inns and Dives wherever we travel, and this place shot straight to the top of our FAV listing today.  Can not recommend strongly enough if you want a trip to Germany for the cost of a meal for sure!  Thank you so very much for a wonderful meal, great conversation with the owners son Richard, and the kindness of actually carrying our box of items ordered to take home for dinner tonight to our car for us!

However we were there on Monday night and it was not busy at all and we had some of the worst service I have ever had.  Our waitress did not bring plates for our appetizer and we had to reach to share it.  No one came so we finally had to ask who I assume was an owner or the manager. When our food arrived it was dropped off.  We wanted more curry catsup and mustard but since we never saw a server again we did not get any   We begged and yelled and finally got one refill.  Dishes were removed at that time after we asked.  We had to ask to pay, and the waitress brought our check and disappeared again.  After about 15 minutes, we asked the same owner or manager to help us.  She hunted down the missing server.  The server said she could not run my credit card and asked me for cash   I do not travel with large amounts of cash.  I was panicking because my prepaid had over a thousand left on it.  She told me a long story about her sister and child support and working at Macys and other things I did not care about in panicked state, and to make a long story short, my guest who I was treating has to pick up the tab.  We went straight to an atm checked the balance and withdrew 100 dollars with no problem.  Unless they fix the service I do not recommend going.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of Downtown Glendale, this noisy little place caught our attention walking by. Now,  I am not German, nor do I even really know what German food is, but I was actually quite surprised and enjoyed my experience.    We sat outside in what looks like an alley, where flags hung from above and where one space heaters warmed 2 tables. Nice and cozy. For two people we ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the giant pretzel, and the paprika schnitzel. This was surprisingly way more than enough food. The mushrooms were great! The we opted to get the pretzel with the extra cheese (~$3 more). I could have done without the horseradish tasting cold cheese in the tiny 2oz cup. I think I was expecting the warm yellow gooy cheese you normally find at the fair...heh. The paprika schnitzel we ordered because apparently Guy Ferrari from Food Network got it and it wasn't bad but not the best thing I've tasted in the world. Its giant fried piece of pork(?) with a side of green beans and german fries.   Environment: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 3/5  Service: 5/5",

There were four of us and we went around 4 to avoid the dinner and lunch crowd.   The server did a great job of making sure we were taken care of.  We ordered a couple of appetizers.  They were the brie with a glaze and the other was a sausage one.  They both were really good.   I ordered that jaeger schnitzel and it was super good.  It came with potatoes and a side of what looked like a coleslaw.  The food was really good.  We ordered the cherry and apple strudels too when done.  The apple was really good.  They seem to be all natural (no sugar seem to be added).  It came with a side of whip cream that was good too.   I would have like to have some beers but I was driving.   The server did a great job and he got a good tip.   Give this place a try.  I have a feeling you will not be disappointed.",

He seemed enthusiastic about it and I know that when a local gets that way about someplace in their backyard, it must be good.  It was.  It is tucked away along Glendale Blvd. and it is bigger than it looks on the outside.  It also has a dining patio that has a lot of flags hanging down over it. The interior looks like you have stepped into a diner in Germany or the Alps.     I ordered the Jager Schnitzel and it was very tender and lots of flavor.  My wife ordered the Nurnberger Bratwurstchen and it seemed like a lot but she finished it.  I tried a bite and the sausage had a snap when you bit into it, was juicy and had a lot of flavor.  Everyone is our party was stuffed, but we still shared a slice of Bavarian chocolate cake!    This restaurant was a fun new experience for us as we have never had German before and I can say I will be back when I am visiting the Phoenix area again.",

Last time we went in, they had a seriously condensed menu that left off some of the items we always ordered. Namely, the stuffed cabbage -- something anyone with a eastern/central European family grew up with (and they did it really well). Super bummed about that. When we asked the server, he said they changed it for Glendale Glitters, and haven't changed it back since. I really hope the old menu makes a comeback, because there's maybe 15-20 options on this one, and there were more than double on the prior menu.",

The Schnitzel was tender and the sauce on it was very flavorful. The potatoes were ok, nothing fantastic but good. We were a large group so I understand slower service so that isn't my complaint, my reason for not 5 stars is the waiter gave us a hard time about ordering any drinks while we waited for a few more people. The first table designated to us was full and he said he didn't want to take drink orders till everyone was there. He ended up doing it but wasn't to happy about it. That is fine but not great customer service. I have only been to one other German restaurant and I liked their food just slightly better but this was very good and I would return with a smaller party!",

Especially with the cream sauce( ask for extra) my Fiance and I ordered the Jagersnitzschel plus added spatzle, potato dumpling, and sauerkraut. Make sure to get extra sauce for everything. Everything was delicious except for the spatzle which could have used a thicker gravy sauce as well as the potato dumpling. I was stationed in Germany awhile back so I think I might know a thing or two... Everything was pretty authentic but I think they need to make the gravy thicker and with a little more flavor. Other than that it was delicious and we will be back to try other things. The Sauer kraut was some of the best we have ever had. Our server was very nice and attentive her name was Angela. The ambiance was great too, we really liked the live music.",

Had the 6 sausages with sauerkraut and potatoes which was good--not fantastic--but good.  For dessert split two desserts with a friend which was apple sTruedel (the very best I have ever had) and the chocolate sauerkraut cake which was sooo chocolatey.  Loved the sTruedel most. Tasted the giant pretzel which is good, but to me not worth the $8.95 which is kinda pricey for what it was.  I mean, really?  Flour and water and $8.95? Regardless, if I ever crave in my entire lifetime German food this is where I will go.   It's good, but there was a German restaurant in Houston that blows this place out of the water which I wish was duplicated here in Phoenix but isn't. Overall, okay place...just the food didn't want to make me yodel at all.",

I've never been to Germany, but it felt like what I imagine Germany to be like. Everything from the decor, to the menu, to the beers on tap had a great German vibe to it.  I decided to order the German Bratwurst. The German Brat came on a plate with sauerkraut and German Fried Potatoes.  The Bratwurst had a great flavor to it and I'd have to say that it's probably the best brat I've ever had. It was very tender with a ton of flavor. The German Fried Potatoes were pretty good, but nothing special.   I loved the tapped beer selection. I love dark beer so I ordered the darkest beer on tap, which is Spaten Optimator. It wasn't as dark as I had hoped, but was very good and had a high alcohol content.   The highlight of the meal was dessert. The bartender suggested that I try the Sauerkraut Chocolate Cake, which sounded so unique, that I had to try it. It was a great piece of cake, very large, very sweet, and very rich. You wouldn't have known that it was Sauerkraut cake, as it only had a very slight hint of the kraut.   A very unique dining experience along with a pretty darn good meal gives Haus Murphy's an above average rating of four stars.",

Virtually anything and everything I could think of was stocked in the dense cabinets, and the tap selection was amazing. Amazing, I tell you! Now, I've never had German beer, but my Dunkel Optimiser hit the spot and packed quite a punch. Would drink again, especially since you can get it as a 32. oz. Are you up to that challenge?  Of course, the overall atmosphere also rocks. I've walked by here a million times and seen the live polka and such. Consider this a place a glimpse of a culture you won't see too often around these parts. Can't wait to tell you about the food!",

    "text": "We were big fans of Haus Murphy's for several years. Some nights the food was better than others but most of the time it was good. On Nov 5, 2016 we realized that the entire staff had changed. We did not recognize anyone there and that should have been our first warning.   I had to explain the menu to our server who managed to get the drinks right. When we ordered our dinners I ordered a side of red cabbage which came out immediately. It was pale pink and had no flavor so I left it there to get cold. Then came the soup which was frozen chunks of asparagus in a milky, tasteless broth of some sort. The asparagus was clearly thrown in frozen and cooled the soup to the point that it was cold and the asparagus was still frozen on the inside.   Entrees were beyond horrible. My schnitzel was made out of scraps which were pieced together on the plate and covered with sauce in hope that I would not find it. Clearly this was stuff they had intended to throw out but apparently ran out of food. Another chicken schnitzel was even worse. It looked like it had been on the floor. It had \"things\" in it. The rouladen were tough and stringy and it was embarrassing to see my 88 year old father trying to pick away at one with a fork to get something to eat.   We brought these really ghastly screw-ups to the attention of our server who brought over the front of house manager who took off the dinners. No problem at that point. It was a very bad night but she did the right thing. Then she sent out the \"chef\". Had I seen him on entering we never would have stayed. He was dirty and even had dirty hair and he came out with enough attitude to part the Red Sea, demanding I tell him what was wrong with \"his\" food. So I did. I added a Mel Brooks line in an attempt to lighten the mood and said my dinner looked like a seder at Vincent Price's house. That's when they guy went off on us, yelling and screaming and then...he threw us out. I've never been thrown out of a restaurant in my life but it happened at Haus Murphy's.   The owners were away that night but I did hear from Rose who called to apologize and a tip of the hat to her. I know that was a difficult call to make. The damage had been done, however and we will never be back. The Hoffmans have tried to \"retire\" since 2012, leaving the restaurant to run itself without a general manager, so there is the front of house, kitchen and bar all doing their own things without any coordinating management. Without them there, things quickly go off the rails in a big way.   The restaurant was up for sale in 2017 with no takers so it seems they have committed to riding out their lease and trying to sell or just closing when that time comes. They have earned some time off but this is not the kind of business where the owners can simply walk away and it doesn't generate the necessary revenue to pay for a really good general manager. We had some good times there and have photos and videos but I'm still not ready to look at them yet. Maybe in a few more years when that horrible night fades.",

    "text": "Ok so I have to start with the fact that I love German food and everywhere I travel I search out German Restaurants. With that said I have been to every kind from good to bad to great. This place lands somewhere in between good and great.   Atmosphere: it is really cute with old world charm. Think grandma's kitchen with plates and artwork on the wall. Kick knacks around. The dining chairs are comfortable. Sometimes restaurants have the uncomfortable kind so as to get you to leave sooner.   Also because it was mentioned prior it was cool and there seemed to be no ac problems.   Service: service was a 5 out of 5 attentive without being over bearing and friendly.   Drink: I ordered and orange blossom and it was like an elevated screwdriver. Also an ice tea and it was good not old or bitter.   Food: the thing everyone wants to know. I had the roulade with an extra side of German potato salad because I wanted to try it. Also It came with soup of the day a beef and barley. The soup was tasty and had a good broth.   The roulade was really nice as was the spetzel and cabbage. I can say that the food was a 5 out of 5. The cabbage has a nice depth of flavor. The potato salad is served warm with a minimal amount of dressing. The roulade is spot on not dried out at all. Nothing was over seasoned.   I also had to breakdown and have an apple dumpling. OMG I think I just got sent to pastry heaven.",

We tried the pretzel and was shared with 4 adults, we also added the cheese sauce which I would pass on next time, they charged $2.50 just for that item. The two mustards were great, house spicy and sweet mustard. BTW the pretzel was out of this world. I tried the Haxe and the wife ordered the Cabbage Roll. Both items were good, not fantastic. Four of us shared the Kraut Chocolate Cake, OMG it was marvelous. So the whole night started out great with the Pretzel and ended super with the Kraut Cake. Don't miss the entertainment in the bar two musicians playing polka music, it was fantastic. Will definitely return and next time I will dance a few polka's.",

It is located in downtown Glendale, and it is a great spot to stop at either before or after a Cardinals game or if you are simply on the west side of Phoenix.  The outdoor seating area is a cool spot to hang out in if the weather is nice.  All the food I have had there is absolutely delicious - I have tried several of their sausages, schnitzel, stuffed mushrooms, pork dishes, etc... and I LOVE LOVE LOVE their sauerkraut & spaetzle!!    The service is always pretty decent, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant is great - very relaxed, chill, and usually the managers are quite attentive... they will typically personally come check on you and ask if everything is okay, and make sure you enjoyed your meal!!  :)  If you love German food ... you should definitely try this place out, because it is AWESOME & AUTHENTIC!!",

It was fairly busy, even at a later hour, but we were promptly seated. Our waitress came by and got us our drink order. We had ordered a couple of beers, which took a while for them to come but they were pretty good as expected.  I will preface this review by saying that I've never had German food before so I didn't really know what I was in for. We were really hungry so we started with the mushroom appetizer dish. It was definitely interesting - The filling was really mushy but flavorful; the cheese sauce it came with was the highlight on the plate. We also got the chicken schnitzel for our main meal. It was really bland / tasteless, mainly super greasy and sides that the meal came with weren't much better. Of course all of this was served up for a pretty pricey ticket. I'm not sure if I just don't like German food or what, but I don't see us coming back.",

The food was ok, I had saurbraten which was fine, the spaetzle and cabbage served with it were very good along with our appetizer of Brie. My husband had the paprika schnitzle we he liked alot. The service was NOT up to par. when my husband commented that the thought he was to get spaetzle with his meal not the bland potatoes he got- the waitress was not very caring and did not do a thing to accommodate. After that she was distant , slow and not very friendly.The strudel we ordered to go was so so and the slice was very small. If I lived near by I might try it again, during the week, but the service has to be alot better.",

Good reviews so I was looking forward to having dinner there  Started off with a brown lager beer which was very good.  My sister got the unfiltered wheat beer. Very good choices to unwind and relax after walking around the town square seeing the Christmas lights    For appetizers we did the stuffed mushrooms and the soft Bavarian pretzel  with the spicy mustard.  Wow.  The mushrooms were perfect and very tasty.  The pretzel is huge and the mustard was a good addition to the pretzel.  Make sure you order both when you go there.     Next thing that came was the chefs soup which comes with the main course.  Cream of mushroom soup.   It was OK.     All of us decided to have the meatloaf with sauteed green beans and German potato salad.   I know we should have tried something different to get a good selection but the meatloaf sounded great.  I tell you what.   It did not disappoint anyone at the table.  Very good.       Only thing I wish I would have tried is some of the desserts but after the mushrooms, pretzel and the meatloaf, all of us were stuffed.    I think it would be a good idea to just go there for desserts.    Good choice for dinner.",

What were really outstanding were the garlic soup (I even ordered an extra bowl... in 100 degree heat!) and giant pretzels (a seasonal offering. Too bad since it was one of the best pretzels I've ever had).   But let's be honest, you come here for the beer. It's expensive, but it's the real McCoy (or, because it is a German restaurant, the real Uter? Yay Simpsons!). Plenty of German ale selections I hadn't even heard it. Yes, they had a beer boot. No, I was not able to chug it all at once despite my best efforts. The drinks are delicious, especially when enjoyed in their outdoor patio.   This is a pretty unique place with some very authentic German food and beer. Definitely nice for a change to the fare offered by most restaurants.",

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the only healthy options (the two sandwiches with ham/pear or turkey/apple) were not available the day we were there.  This is not a place to try to find healthy eating options!  But the grilled Reuben was excellent, with a ton of meat.  Great fries, too!  Definitely recommend this restaurant!",

First of all, I love the fact that they have plenty of free parking; even on a Sat night.  The restaurant is actually much larger than I thought with the huge back room where we were seated.    Since it is a German restaurant, we were ready to try their beer but didn't have a clue as to which one...our waitress took delivery of bringing us samples to see which one we favor.  That was very nice of her.  After ordering the beer, we had the imported pretzel, Paprika Schnitzel, Sauerbraten.    *Pretzel = YUM!  It was crusty on the outside and very chewy inside. *Paprika Schnitzel = very much like Japanese cutlet.  Not as flavorful.. *Sauerbraten = we tried it because we heard that it takes 4 days.  Honestly, the only thing we could taste was the thick sauce, the meat was kinda tough, and the pasta was bland.  On the upside, I liked the red cabbage.  Overall, it was a great experience with live German music, great beer and pretzel.   But would we go back?...probably not.  *Ambiance = Wonderful!  It doesn't really feel like AZ. *Food = mediocre...we prefer more flavor *Area = good.  in the middle of old town Glendale. *Service = great.  we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us.",

I would have to agree with another posting here on Yelp, that the schnitzel is premade and microwaved for their average diner. It wasn't crisp and crunchy right off the stove or fryer, I was actually disappointed in that, since the breading had become soft and soggy. and the roasted potatoes were well done on one side and were burned.  We had a reservation, arrived, were attempted to be seated and the table still had patrons at it.  The restaurant didn't have adequate entrance space and there was no waiting area save the Biergarten, which is outside.  Its the end of July, in Phoenix. It was literally 115 degrees and we were asked to wait outside.... Once inside, it felt like there are too many tables were crammed in for the space and it was hot inside from just too many people, and the waiter seemed distracted, rushed and was not actually seen very often. We were thirsty a few times. After reading all the great reviews, I was truly disappointed.  I know there is no place perfect, and I am not a particularly picky person but this isn't quality German food. We won't be returning",

    "text": "So after my first taste of German cuisine ('cause Weinerschnitzel doesn't count) I emailed my American friend living in Germany to ask if they really have any fruits and vegetables in Germany. Deep fried chicken, three types of sausage, German potato salad... Does red cabbage really count as a vegetable?  I'm not a big fan of sausage but I'm guessing the veal sausage is a little bland compared to what you might be able to find at a German Deli.  The chicken fried chicken was AMAZING and I highly recommend either that dish or the pork chop. I also thought the pretzel was worth coming back for.  I did not brave any German beer, but the house iced tea was fresh.  The wait staff was a bit overattentive, but better that than under attentive, yes?   My American German friend was annoyed that I ate every German Food Stereotype for dinner. But since I'm not going to Germany anytime soon, I guess Haus Murphy's will do. He did confirm, however, that they DO have healthy food and fruits and vegetables there. ;)",

She still said its the best she's had and I have to agree its very moist and just sweet enough. And they actually give u a good slice for the price compared to other places that give u a tiny sliver.

It's a German place and the one pasta dish they have there is even killing.  It's a bit expensive, but worth it in every way.    For the drinkers, it's a little bit of heaven.  They always have about 5 German beers on tap usually Franziskaner WeissBier, Warsteiner Dunkel, Spaten Optimator, A Weistephaner, and a Pilsner of German origin.  I used to hit up the happy hour here on a reg and deplete them on mustard and pretzels.  They also serve beers in the huge mugs if you're a drunk or just like big things.",

No additional lemon based gravy, made for a super dried out experience. Potatoes were too mushy. Apfel Strudel was very good, but obviously over hot from a microwave 'heat-up' before serving.

The dining hall is split into three areas, each with it's own distinct feel. There's the bar, complete with accordion player and loads of German booze. The patio, which has a great Euro feel to it. And lastly, there's what I like to call the \"breakfast\" area, which is closest to the main entrance.   These three distinct areas cover quite a bit of ground, and definitely add to the feel of the \"German\" experience.   I have only had one dish the several times I've been to Murphy's, but that's all you really need from a place like this. My go-to meal is the Stuffed Mushrooms. These babies are HUGE, stuffed to the brim with fine german-style meat, The sauce they place them in is superb and ultimately makes it.  I would recommend Haus Murphy to anyone looking for something different in the metropolitan Phoenix area.",

Dinner was phenomenal! So good and too much to finish! We each had to have boxes to go, but still insisted on grabbing a couple of desserts for the road ( apple and cherry streusel)  2 appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts for about $44 was pretty reasonable for this kind of place. Overall great place to eat and the staff was great and accommodating! It's a little out of the way to drive for me ( about 30 minutes from where we live) so we won't be going as often as we'd like, but I would highly recommend this place for a late lunch or dinner!

The atmosphere is great on Friday/Saturday nights, and on certain nights they have a band play German polka music, which adds to the experience.  The food, although relatively expensive, is priced well considering how much you get and how good it tastes.  The beer is quite expensive, but you can try some pretty unique German beers, so for some it may be worth it.  The schnitzel (any meat), potato pancakes and Black Forest cake are a personal favorite.  I always recommend Haus Murphy's to people looking for good food, and especially for those looking to try something a little different.",

I also went with my son and husband for Oktoberfest celebration with my German Club and the food was remarkable that night.  I enjoy eating here but I will say the down side for me, simply, not enough beer choices.  I am a stout and ale kind of girl and they only had one and it was not great.  My son loved the food and often asks when we will be going back.  I highly recommend this place but be sure of one thing, it fills up fast and the seating is a little tight (meaning they don't have a lot of space) and unless the patio is open you may have a wait time!",

For example like Chinese food, if you travel to China I can assure you won't find a Panda Express cuisine type restaurant anywhere. Panda Express is American Chinese food. That being said the \"German Food\" at this restaurant didn't impress.  I don't think I will ever go out of my way to eat German food again. To be fair the Giant Pretzel was amazing. The sausage sampler was delicious. But aside from that, the food seemed kinda bland. The breaded protein with the crispy potatoes is called The schnitzel you have a choice of chicken veil and pork. That was ok. German pasta is called Spatzle, it has a different texture but it was bland didn't have any flavor to it. Deserts were delicious we had the  chocolate cake and the cherry   I was not aware that this restaurant had been on TV. I guess one of Guy Fieri shows filmed and reviewed this restaurant. Good for them. If you're close by stop in and have a pretzel and a beer. Skip the menu.",

We ordered the Brie appetizer, but the batter was still raw and the cheese cold and not melted. A big let down. Then we tried the sauerkraut and pork sausage soup and things started looking up. It was superb, definitely home made with love. I then had the goulash with pickled red cabbage and spaetzle (sorry about spelling). It just tasted like a meat curry nothing like German cuisine and I did not eat it. Bob had the pork shank, which he said he would not go back for. All in all a disappointing dinner date.  This restaurant was recommended by some friends who rave about it.  The carpet was ripped and every horizontal surface is  covered in a thick layer of dust. The 10 inch wide end of an air vent is covered in thick hanging ropes of dust just the same as the fan blades. These pipes are directly above the tables dropping dust bunnies into people's dinner. You can imagine the remaining issues.",

This is the German food I found in home kitchens in Hamburg.  The schnitzels are True schnitzels and delicious.  The sausages are correctly named and not American knock-offs. The hackbraten would do my grandmother proud (though I thought she called it hackerbraten). But the sauerbraten is beyond belief!  That alone would make a trip to Phoenix worth the price.   The ambiance is home-style, not elegant - but it doesn't have to nor should it be. The service has always been adequate and friendly.  The ambiance is a 4 and the service a 3+ but the quality of the food is so wonderful the overall rating is a 5 (but should be higher).  I truly cannot see how anyone who has truly eaten here could rate Haus Murphy's less than a 5.  (Well unless they don't care that much for True German food and then I could see the lowest rating a 4+)",

The decor was quaint and Bavarian, which I know from having spent time in Bavaria, and Munich for Oktoberfest!  The waitress we had was so helpful, we asked what she would order, and she shared her faves, amongst them which I enjoyed were the stuffed mushroom apps, and the Pear Bratten Sandwich, so yummy!  You can mix the sweet of fruit with the savory that lies within this yummy sandwich.  I chose fries as the side, and they were really yummy, unlike regular fries showing up at most restaurants.    I enjoyed the Spaten Lager, the small still made a large beer for me, but I was in Bavarian heaven today!  Our lunch was 2 hours, it was so comfortable to just sit, enjoy chit chat, the food, and not feel rushed to leave, as would be the case being invited into a German home for lunch.

The service is fantastic, the beer is great, and the food, well that has become really hit or miss.  I would love to 5 star this place because I grew up in the area and have been here dozens of times and it had been great.  But recent trips there have left me using the word \"bland\" a lot.  The pork schnitzel was flat out not good, and the spicy brat which was always one of my favorites here did not measure up either.  Worst of all, on my new years eve visit, they were \"out\" of the fried potatos and left us with average potato salad and french fries.  I'll probably be back, because I go to many downtown Glendale events, and have a little sentimental value in this place...but I sure hope it steps back up.",

Started the eating part of the night with a couple giant pretzels.  Giant is correct; the thing was as big as my head! And big, puffy, salty, and delicious! With the brown mustard, it was definitely a hit!  We ordered the Bauernplatte, which is listed as a combo for two, but handily accommodated three of us.  The schnitzel was delicious, the german fried potatoes were delicious, bratwurst was ok.  I avoided the red cabbage because I'm not a fan, but the other diners stated it was fantastic.  Beer: Weihenstephan Hefeweizen was everything a wheat beer should be; rich and full-bodied, but not too heavy, with a very light citrus attribute.  Franziskaner Weissbier was phenomenal! Delicious, rich, perfect.  Franziskaner Dunkel was superb.  Can't wait to sample the remainder of their selections.  The live music was really awesome.  They have a nice patio, with misters, so even in the summer it should be pleasant.  I would never have guessed a place like this existed in Glendale. Now that I'm aware of its existence, I will certainly try to return.",

    "text": "I've been to Haus Murphy's several times over the last few years. It has always been a great experience. The food is decently priced, the service has always been quick,  and the staff have always been extremely helpful.  With regard to the food, I have always been very pleased. The food is always fresh, portions are generous and the taste is amazingly authentic. If you are looking for a great German meal, you cannot go wrong with any selection.  On of the few downsides is that on days when downtown Glendale is having an event, the lunch menu is scrapped for a slimmed down dinner menu. This can be disappointing if you are looking forward to a lunch item. Luckily, their dinner menu has plenty of alternatives. If you live as far out as I do, just be sure and check Glendale's event calendar or call the restaurant.   Also, be prepared to search for parking. Most spots are free, but depending on what is going on downtown, parking fills up fast.",

    "text": "While I'm a fan of downtown Glendale I think this place fares a little above average in my book.  I'd put it between 3 to 4 stars but not near the upper half of that range.  I've been here several times and I feel like I'm trying to like the place during each visit.  I don't think that is a great sign, some places I can walk into and already know that the restaurant is a hit.  Things I did like was the nice looking decor, homey feeling, and the beer choices.  I also like the location smack dab in the middle of downtown and it's right across the street from an American Recovery project that is sprucing up an alleyway to make the area more appealing to pedestrians.  I'd like to see what this looks like when the project is finished.  Things I didn't like was the food, which is nothing to brag about.  The flavors are ok, but nothing to make me say wow that was a great meal.  Another thing, I know the place is supposed to look old, but it's on the verge of looking run down and dirty.  A little extra cleaning and maybe a few upgrades would change this opinion of mine.  Haus Murphy is still a great choice for experiencing a German restaurant here in the valley.  This place has much more potential to be a complete hit.",

I don't know why anyone would go there and order anything but sausage or schnitzel.... It's a German place, don't order a cheese plate or a pasta.  The Hubby and I hit them up about every other week now that we live within walking distance. The beer is great - fantastic German options that are wicked hard to find on draft anywhere else in town.  The atmosphere is just okay, but the service has always been good... the sausage is YUMMY and the sauerbraten is to DIE for. All of their sides are tasty too - I've never lived in Germany, but the spatzle, wirsing, red cabbage and dumplings are UBER!  Don't expect it to change your life, but go get your beer on- star with a sausage sampler and try something off the specials or schnitzel list.",

    "text": "As I walked the streets of downtown Glendale, the Oom-Pah music wafting down the alleyways let me know what I was in for: GOOD TIMES.  You really could come here just to drink.There's a full-fledged beer garden outdoors on the side of the restaurant where a band was set up, playing traditional polka which goes great with beers. Even though we're in the desert it was pretty chilly out there so we opted to stay indoors. Bring a sweater just in case.  Vegetarians beware! You're not gonna find much to eat here. We ordered the stuffed mushrooms (stuffed with meat, of course) as an appetizer, the bauernplatte combo, a GIANT BEER (a one liter mug of their darkest, the Optimator), and for dessert, a slice of black forest cake. oh, and some GOOD TIMES.  We came real hungry and the portions did not disappoint. The stuffed mushrooms were not only pretty to look at, they were also huge and very delicious. I could see someone ordering this appetizer and making it a meal just by itself. Not having been here before, or properly indoctrinated into German cuisine, my wife and I decided that the combo for two would be a good start: spicy bratwurst (my fave), German bratwurst (also good!), weisswurst (least fave), a kassler kotelett (fried and flavorful) and some pork schnitzel, with (THE BEST) sauerkraut, red cabbage (so good!), fried potatoes (yes!) and some German potato salad (YES!) on the side. Like I said, we were hungry, and managed to put a dent into little over half that platter. Our server initially brought me out the wrong beer, which was sorta funny because I had asked him for a recommendation, and it had to have passed through his head as he was lugging this huge mug to my table. I did taste it before I sent it back, and it was good, but when the Optimator showed up, all was right with the world (I kind of get excited when I walk into a place and there's beers on tap that I haven't tried, and even more so when they turn out to be amazing)! To finish the meal off we thought, \"Ah, what the hell,\" and split a piece of the black forest cake, which was pretty good, but next time I wanna try the strudel.   Haus Murphy's is an institution, and we will definitely be back with a full crew to put this place to the test. I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Arizona as far as the menu, the ambiance, the fantastic beers, and the aforementioned GOOD TIMES.",

From the greeting on they are very welcoming and make you feel right at home. I had the Eisbein and was in German Heaven. My only negative comment is likely due to the volume of folks in for Father's Day as the service was a bit slow and one of our party had to send their food back for a bit more time in the oven. The issue was minor and was taken care of instantly with an apology for the inconvenience. Again, this was probably due to the higher than average volume of the holiday so I will definitely head back on a normal day to try more of the menu and you should too! P.S. Don't ask questions, just order the slice of Chocolate Sauerkraut Cake. Sooooo goood",

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms ($8.95) as an appetizer, and I ordered the paprika schnitzel ($14.95) while my husband got the schweinshaxen ($19.95).   I have no idea what was going on with the service because various waiters and food runners came up to us, \"is this your tea?\" Nope. \"Did you order this wine?\" Nope again. \"You ordered this beer?\" Still no.  Our mushrooms came out in a heap on a paper AZ cardinals plate. It tasted fine but presentation looked like something you'd scoop onto your own plate at a backyard bbq.  A half hour after our appetizer came out, we were presented with meals that we didn't order, including some sort of bratwurst. We let the food runner know that it wasn't our order before he even set the food down.   Our waiter double checked his pad and came back to let us know that he put in the wrong order. We waited another 30+ minutes for our food to come out. My husband's meal was served on a disposable black plastic plate and mine was served on another disposable AZ Cardinals plate.   There was nothing done to remedy the mix up and the extra long wait for our food. Our waiter had to take off 4 different entrees on our bill that he brought over for us to sign. I had to flag down a waitress just to get a pen to for my husband to sign the check.  We're not driving down here again to eat here.",

The food however has changed, and not for the better,  We had the Jaeger Schnitzel and the Wiener schnitzel.  Both were about half the size of what they use to be, Both were dry and the Wiener schnitzel was a bit tough.  The fried potato's were almost completely burned, and so thin they could have been chips.  The red cabbage, my personal favorite, was not nearly as sweet nor did it have the sight apple flavor it use to have.  And unfortunately, the famous sauerkraut chocolate cake was quite dry.  I don't know what happened, but I will be looking for a new German restaurant . So sad",

Have been here for their October fests over the years (yes a must try!) and came here today to take my Dad and Uncle to lunch for Veterans Day. 1st off the service was great. Jimmie greeted us and got us a table outside. He promptly asked what we wanted for drinks- me and my Aunt decided to try the Ayinger Celebrator (bock beer) which yes if you like a dark beer it is a full bodied yummy beer. Next to order. Three orders of Original German Brat an order of Huhner (chicken) Schnitzel  and a side of the potato pancakes with apple sauce. The food came quickly and was piping hot and everyone raved about their meals! The portions are big enough that we all got to go boxes to bring home!    I recommend Haus Murphy to anyone that enjoys good food and atmosphere. Side note. Year round they do 10% off the bill for veterans. On Veterans day they give a nice 15% off as thanks!",

Our server was a little frazzled about having to deal with this. We were pretty darn close to the bar and our server told me that he was not taking any drink orders until everyone had arrived and I had already known some were 10 to 15 mins out, so off to the bar I went!    I'm still fairly new to the whole ordering beer, so when I walked up to the bar the bar tender asked what do I like, and I told him I'm still unsure, since I'm new to drinking beer, he said oh you must be 21 haha Love him!! He offered me samples of all the beers they have on tap, which I thought I was pretty sweet and I went with a nice glass of Warsteiner Dunkel, it went perfectly well with everything! Kudos to the bar tender!   When I had already ordered my drink my server came to me and told me well I'm taking drink orders now, and I told him you told me to go to the bar and get my own drink so I did and I have.    Everyone placed their order, even folks who arrived 20 mins late got their order in, everyone except me got their food, even my daughter who was on the same check as me, ten minutes go by and the server noticed I didn't have my meal, oh it must have been forgotten. UGH!!!! I was upset!! But within minutes my food appeared and I took a bite and OMG ITS DELISH!!! and being upset slowly faded away, one could say I ate my feelings LOL (not really)   I ordered the Huhner (Chicken) Schnitzel with German fried potatoes and Wirsing, it did also come with a bowl of split pea soup, which was amazing, reminded me of the times I went to Pea Soup Andersen's in California, so good! The schnitzel with mushroom gravy was soo yummy!! Couldn't believe I ate it all!! It also came with fried taters and this Irish girl luvs them taters & wirsing, it was my 1st experience with that, didn't even know what I was eating when I started, it was creamy melty goodness, learned it was cream cabbage, omg really? That was dang good!  But what I came for was the Sauerkraut Cake, yea that's right, sauerkraut cake!!! I have heard nothing but praise for this cake, they said its better than a death by chocolate cake!! I had to find out for myself!! OOOOMMMMYYYYYGGGAAAWWWDDD!!!! It's amazing!!    Sometimes the company makes the evening more pleasurable then the overall experience & the food was simply delicious , service well that could have been better.  I'm already craving some more schnitzel so I see myself coming back soon.",

Desperate for a taste of Germany, though, my husband and I looked up the menu online a few nights ago and decided it looked really great. Maybe my experience was a fluke! We hoped so anyway, as we set out about 30 miles or so across the city to eat at Haus Murphy's.  So we wait for about 30 minutes for a table and get a seat outside. It's a nice atmosphere, but immediately we notice the menu we've been given doesn't have a whole bunch of stuff on it that's on their website menu. We bring this up to the server and he tells us they serve a limited menu for 6 weeks during Glendale Glitters.   We sit there and stew for about 5 minutes over this menu thing. None of the things we wanted to order are on this limited menu. We decide that's BS and get up and leave. We see our server and tell him we're leaving since their menu isn't the one advertised on their website. He tells us we should have called to check. Excuse me?? Is it my responsibility to call to make sure your website is updated?? What am I, your project manager??  Thanks a lot, Haus Murphy's, for wasting a couple of hours of our precious Saturday night time and about $15 in gas. Maybe you should update your website to let people know what you actually serve at your restaurant. Misleading advertising to say the least.",

These are two of my favorite German dishes. I was sorely disappointed. The meat was tough and flavorless as was the Spatzle and Potato Dumpling. The Red Cabbage  was good but I've tasted just as good out of a can. The highlight of the meal was the Onion Soup. That was truly delicious. However, not worth the $45 bill for two people for just the entrees. The Service was excellent with no complaint there. However, I expected much more, especially from a restaurant that has been around as long as this one. If you want to try a truly excellent German restaurant go to The German Cafe in Sierra Vista. It will give you a taste of really authentic German cooking.",

    "text": "[UPDATE] My December 2011 still stands pretty much as I wrote it then, minus just under a half star but not enough to take them down to 3-stars (yet). We have been to Haus Murphy's since 2011 but I wanted to do a quick update based on this, my December 2014 visit. This time we shared what the website describes as a single combination plate (the printed menu calls it something different) and the Roulade, which is described similarly to the online menu. We did that because we could get tastes of a bratwurst, a slightly smoked pink pork chop, the Roulade, German potatoes, sauerkraut, red cabbage and spaetzli.  Everything was okay. I liked the taste of the Roulade, if I didn't know what was supposed to be in it, which their menu states as filled with Pickle, Bacon and Onion; smothered with Golden Mustard. The reality is I could see, find nor taste any of the above. More like they mystery paste that's inside a Chef Boyardee Ravioli. It tasted fine but none of those flavors was present in any way, and it's pretty hard to hide the tastes of pickle, bacon, onion and mustard!  Instead of beer we opted for a nice hearty white wine. Some things have changed a bit over time ... the spaetzli was served plain, no gravy. The soup was much better but still served lukewarm. And some things haven't changed ... for example they still don't serve nor offer a bread plate. It's like they have no clue how meals are served in Germany and most of eastern Europe. Our server (Austin) was almost everything you would want in a server ... polite, attentive, upbeat and happy (as everyone at Haus Murphy seems to always be). On the downside, I would suggest he learn just a minimal amount about the very limited selection of wines they offer. His response to our basic wine questions was very deer-in-the-headlights.  My rating hasn't changed; they still are very good with the potential of earning 5-stars if they tried harder. The only (huge) negative that I won't grade them on is that whenever the front door is opened (about every 5 seconds) a frigid blast of cold air rushes in and quick-freezes everything on your plate. There has to be a better way, like build another door from the kitchen directly to the patio so they don't have to carry plated meals through the dining room (how hard could that be?). Until then I just wanted to yell \"Murphy, Shut The Front Door!\"  Final note ... NO restaurant anywhere that wants to be taken more seriously than a Denny's should EVER serve ice water in plastic Pepsi tumblers. For a sit-down restaurant that is a total fail.",

But what brought the tear down my cheek was the jaeger schnitzel.  The center was barely done and the edges were like shoe leather!  They didn't pound it properly and poof they made me cry. But I'm a sucker for bread pudding and I thought maybe their forte is dessert, it is NOT it was dense and almost tasteless. Sad. Very sad.  If Guy Fieri had this food and was ok with it.

    "text": "I was walking with the family by Glendale Glitters and noticed Haus was right down the street. My sister loved the pretzels there, so we went.  The staff didn't look to busy for a Sunday evening and they took a good 10 minutes to even greet us, which bugged me a bit. After they finally greeted us, the female hostess got mad at us for seating ourselves. But we just listened to the guy up front and he told to seat ourselves,  which we explained to the female.   Now to the food. I don't know if it is cause I'm Mexican, but the food was very bland and tasteless. The pretzel was only okay at best. The other thing we ordered was the stuffed mushrooms and you can only taste the mushroom itself. Where's the sausage and other flavors?  Safe to say, I won't be returning to this place.",

When you go, be prepared to take home a lot of food. I ordered the wiener snitzel and when it came I was overwhelmed. It fed me dinner for three nights!  The service was friendly but a bit confused. They didn't ask if we were ready to order, we had to ask to order and then they didn't ask the whole table but went back and forth putting orders in one at a time.  My friend had the kilometre, which was a huge sausage with a bit of spice to it. It was about 2 feet long!   The atmosphere is cute and very pub like. The waiters are all dressed in German attire and they are playing German music.   I would return again.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago I was watching an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and they're doing a feature on this restaurant.   Knowing I would be heading to Phoenix soon AND I don't have German food very often, I bookmarked it, then ask my friends if they want to have dinner here.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=xeRpdNyGlTwF4SNYZ3588A#XdSMeOjMFXkDYkLe9CmVSg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a>  Fast forward to Friday afternoon.  I call and ask if they take reservations, they said yes, so I made one.   We arrived about 15 minutes early and the place is packed!   Come reservation time, they didn't have a table ready and asked us to wait in a \"waiting area\".   It's a small group of tables at the back of the bier garten.  I figured I might as well have a bier, right?  So I ordered a hefeweizen.   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA#fGrf2cHDXfDKshCS8vDofA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a>  After about 15 minutes they had a table ready in the \"bier garten\".   Yes it was cool outside but they had tons and I mean TONS of heaters!   There were three heaters around our table in very close proximity and another heater near the next table about 2 feet away.  We sat down and while my friends enjoyed the heat, I started baking immediately.  SERVICE: All of the staff were very nice!   Our server Jeremy seemed to have very little personality and only smiled once when I made a joke.    However he did do a very good job taking care of us.   I ended up speaking with Rose, the owner.    What a sweet and fun lady!   We chatted about the restaurant and her experience with Guy Fieri and the production staff for the show.   She said they filmed that segment about 6 years ago.  Rose also told me they've been in business for 18 years and at this location for the last eight years.  Her restaurant can seat 300, she has a staff of 22 working the front of house and 12 in the small kitchen.  As we were dining two gentleman came out and started serenading the bier garten with an accordion and a tuba!   Hmm, does two make an \"Oom-pah-pah band\"?   <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#Xg7Kg3cwQvevC0BJMIuXbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a> They starting with \"roll out the barrel\" of course, and continued with a number of other bier drinking songs and Christmas songs for a good 30 minutes.   For me anyway, it made the whole evening that much more fun!  FOOD:  We started with a giant pretzel!   It was warm, soft and very tasty!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#2s8FvkPpB0J_OGZSxDiYHA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a>  (notice my phone for a size reference)   I really wanted to try 5 different entrees, but could only have one, so Paprika Schnitzel it is!    The entrees come with a cup of soup, which was a \"lemon martini\" on Friday.   It was quite tasty, but I didn't really get lemon or martini.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#lYe5isj_vkLSPwbdJHF8qQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a>  The schnitzel is pork loin pounded flat, breaded and pan fried golden brown and is topped with an onion and bacon infused paprika sauce.   it also comes with German fried potatoes (with garlic and caraway) and wirsing (shredded cooked cabbage and onion in a creamy cheese sauce) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#L0eXT4gWympRVAeAB-1_PA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a>   The pork was very tender and tasty.  The paprika sauce was WONDERFUL but also very subtle and nearly \"disappeared\" on the schnitzel.   I LOVED the wirsing!   The potatoes were very good too!   One friend ordered the Hackbraten, which is a beef and pork meatloaf with roasted onion gravy, spatzle and red cabbage.   I was able to taste the meatloaf and it was fantastic!  DESSERT: We couldn't leave without dessert, so we ordered and shared the Apple Strudel (Very good), Cherry Strudel (to die for!) and the \"sauerkraut cake\" (A chocoholics dream!).    <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#NGjfFFw99WpS8Gzdt0-U8w\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#DdkM66FWNZZh2yjbHPQGFA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/haus-murphys-glendale-2?select=pq5r8L6skpkexVuFB4gRAg#ovcyB00DsctJwyk3X7TMpA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/haus...</a>  OVERALL: it was an awesome evening with wonderful food and a great German atmosphere!  4.5 stars rounded up!",

We were greeted by a nice German lady who warned us of a couple of sweat bees that were wanting a taste a beer but weren't interested in the people.   No bother.  They left us alone.  Lunch was great!  I had a daily special sandwich that was hackbraten on grilled rye bread.  I can't remember what it was called.  My hubs is a sucker for Sauerbraten.  Also ordered a plate of potato pancakes.    Best pancakes we have found, ever.   My mom and step dad aren't impressed with this place as they used to be and they live in the area but I had to see for myself.  It's too bad their experiences aren't what we had.  We loved it.  Also tried the new Schoffhofer grapefruit beer.  I am on the hunt for this stuff now.  It's so good!   I handed my hubs the keys and ordered another.  Too bad we cannot get the beer here in Michigan.  The bill was a little hefty but we weren't watching it and it was worth the wonderful afternoon of leisurely lunching with the old folks on a weekday afternoon.   There isn't a large selection of German restaurants in the Valley but you don't need anymore more when you have Haus Murphy in downtown Glendale.",

I was still reflecting on the German meatloaf, red cabbage and Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen.  How do you say, \"Damn that was good!\" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).  The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.  There was quite a bit of sharing going on and although I don't remember everything I tried, it was all really good.  It was great to see so many friends and meet some new Yelpers like Norm!",

I've never had German food so I went over some Yelp pics while waiting to get an idea of what I wanted.  I ordered the Huhner (chicken) Schnitzel that came with a white wine sauce, I ordered it with the mushroom sauce instead.  My mom got the Jager (pork) Schnitzel.  I also ordered french fries on the side because I had been craving fries alllll day.  Our food took a bit to come out but it was okay, it gave us time to admire all of the cute decor.  My schnitzel was just on the warm side when it came out & wasn't crispy which I was expecting it to be. It was just more of a soft piece of chicken with soft breading.  It came with the white wine sauce even though I asked for a different one, our server apologized & brought me a side of the mushroom sauce.  It was already too late since my chicken came with the sauce all over it to begin with.  Oh well.  The flavor was pretty good, I was just really looking forward to the chicken being crispy.  Is schnitzel supposed to be crispy? I'm not sure, but I'll give it another try.",

For dinner, I ordered the Krakauer Wurst, a spicy beef and pork sausage with a crispy sausage casing (\"spicy\" and \"crispy\" were the keywords in my choosing this dish!) platter, which included German fried potatoes, sauerkraut, and a bowl of chicken and cabbage soup ($9.95).  I would order this dish again!  Loved the spiciness and textures of the sausage (would I be able to enjoy trying out the other non-spicy dishes if I decide not to order the Krakauer on my next visit??), and the fried potatoes were very good- of course, I only ate the crispiest of the bunch.  I've been avoiding cabbage for many months now, but after sampling a taste of it tonight, I had to have more :)  I didn't taste the soup- that came home with me for my roomie to enjoy- but a few others received it with their meals, and the aroma was intoxicating!  BTW, I was also handed some horseradish on the side as part of the platter, but the sausage was spicy enough that I didn't need it.  For dessert, I ordered a slice of the German chocolate cake ($6.95?)- four layers of cake iced with homemade whip cream, cherry jam with cherries, and almond slivers coating one side.  A dollop of fresh whip cream placed beside it just added a little more sweetness to this lovely meal's end.  I would also order this confection again =)  I almost forgot!  Haus Murphy was gracious enough to offer two complimentary pretzels for the table.  While I had only a couple of small twists, I really enjoyed them!  I will surely order this on my next visit!",

Then quite some time before the drinks arrived.  After she dropped the drinks off, she left.  Again, quite some time later, she took our order.  One in our party had a hard time deciding.  Instead of possible suggestions, the server just stood there.  The prezels were amazing.  The beer cheese soup came out only lukewarm, but was good.  We advised our server of this issue and she seems uninterested.  Four of our 5 dishes arrived, but our youngest son's chicken strips did not arrive with the rest of the food.  We were told they would be \"right out\".  All our dishes were lukewarm.  We had to ask for refills on our sodas and waters.  Finally, after we were pretty much finished with our meals, my son's chicken strips arrived.  No apologies, no \"let me take that off your ticket\", no nothing.  Server was pretty much non-existent.  Of the dishes, the roulade was excellent, as was the goulash.  Spatzle was bland.  Chicken schnitzel was good.",

    "text": "Due to misunderstanding regarding our order, was given the opportunity to sample more items than expected: Bauernplatte combo for two.  I'm not usually a sausage fan, and have actually never eaten Bratwurst, but the German Bratwurst (pork) and Spicy Bratwurst (beef) were actually rich, smooth, and flavorful.  My husband enjoyed the Kassler Kotelett (pork chop), but neither of us were impressed with the Hackbraten (German meatloaf) or Schwabische Spatzle (noodles).  I have to admit, I've eaten a lot of sauerkraut in my life, and the stuff here is pretty darned good.  The German potato salad and fried potatoes were good as well.  The pork schnitzel was fine, but could use some additional seasoning.  Finally, we also tried the bread pudding, which was cold, and tasted more like unbaked bread dough than real bread pudding.  Outdoor patio is spacious and pleasant.",

    "text": "Wunderbar!  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in metro Phoenix.  I've been there 3 times now and have loved each visit.  On two of the visits I sat at the patio area.  On both nights it was chilly but they keep propane heaters going that really warm the place up (you might not want to sit too close to them as they give off a lot of heat) the other time I sat at the bar watched a game whilst drinking German beer and eating a giant Bavarian pretzel.  Haus Murphy's has great atmosphere and darn good food.  The above mentioned pretzel is a must and goes great with the German mustard.  Their mustard has a great kick and will clear any nasal passage.  As far as the entrees I have had the sauerbraten and the schweinebraten and enjoyed both.  The German beer selection tops anything I've seen in Phoenix thus far.  I recommend the Konig Ludwig Hefeweizen.  Service was great every visit.  Kudos to the manager who dealt with a fussy customer at the table across from mine during my last visit.  She took it all in stride and didn't let if phase her one bit.  Very professional even when being wronged.  I can't praise them enough.  I'd give them 5 stars but I've been to a German restaurant elsewhere that was better (no fault to Haus Murphy's, the other place is that amazing).  It's especially nice this time of year since you can sit out on the patio and take in the Glendale Glitters while enjoying a great meal.",

Their brown gravy tasted like something from a grade school cafeteria which was a real let down. The potato dumpling bland and their 'giant' pretzel was smaller than the kind you get from snack bars. Also they no longer have rye bread with herb butter.. they use some bought dinner rolls, pretty lame!   Now the good stuff.. the Bauernplatte for two was awesome! Heaping helping of sausages, kraut and friend taters.. was wonderful! The German potato salad was the best Ive had, just great!  So all the little stuff really took its toll for me on this place.. perhaps it was an off night for the kitchen? Its a pretty far drive to find out.",

    "text": "The sausage/bratwurst at Haus Murphy's is great.  Very flavorful, but I am more fond of the Krakaur (sp?) brat than the others.   The sausage appetizer is definitely great for a big group and comes with a mustard that is excellent.  Our german waiter was a nice touch. :)  We sat in the lounge area which is nicely decorated and the bar looks great.  The tables being put together is pretty cool, although I kind of wished they were the same type/size so that you didn't feel like the puzzle pieces didn't match.  But that may be my OCD talking.  The food did take a while to cook.  I didn't get a chance to try the schnitzel, but one day I will.  Meanwhile I had the German Brat, which was moist and flavorful.  It was on top of the saurkraut... which having been a child who hated saurkraut, I tried it yesterday for the first time since, and I liked it.  So kudos to them for changing my view of saurkraut.  Unfortunately, my diet currently limits any starches, so I was unable to try the potatos that came with it, but they sure smelled good and looked seasoned appropriately.  The german beer was AWESOME coming in these HUGE mugs... all I needed was one beer.  Price wasn't too bad either.  $34 for a German Brat plate, Krakaur (sp?) brat plate, a side salad, and two german beers.  We would definitely go back.",

    "text": "How hilarious that two stars is \"Meh\" because that famous phrase of Larry David's was how I was going to begin this review.  The giant pretzel? So so, probably microwaved. The menu is fairly pedestrian- why is it so hard to find German food other than wursts, schnitzels, saurbraten, and the occasional rouladen? Oh yeah, the smoked pork chops too- the kassler whatever. There's so much more to German food.  First course was a soup not congruous with a German eatery. I don't remember exactly what it was, some cream soup that should have been called cream of milk.  My companion had a stew or goulash that was on offer that night. He liked it, but then again he's from St. Louis and thinks that Steak N Shake burgers are the shizzle.  I had a sampler platter, don't remember what side dishes came with it, I believe they were generous and fairly tasty- not sublime, but tasty, albeit mostly forgettable. (If you read my other reviews you will note that I tend to remember everything I ordered and the subtle nuances thereof)  I'd take a pass on Haus Murphy's, and that's sad, because they have a cute little biergarten and I like to support independent restaurateurs- a dying breed.

FYI Haus Murphy's is generally packed so a reservation is helpful but not necessary.  Also it is not as cheap as a trip to Chili's, so be prepared to spend $35 and up if you want the full experience, obviously more if you are going to have drinks.  My recommendation is to try something new off the appetizer menu when you go!",

    "text": "My husband & I were excited to try this place, especially since my husband spent 4 yrs in Germany.  He always raved about how wonderful Jager Schnitzel is.    We decided to go on a Saturday, for lunch.  Because reservations are recommended, we called and asked if they had anything for around 1:30 (it was 12:00 when we called).  They said \"no problem.\"  When we arrived at about 1:10, we noticed there were only 3 tables with patrons.  They seated us right away.  First impression was that the entire restaurant needs a MAJOR redo and update on the decor!  The carpet was filthy, and as we passed all the varied & different  pictures (tons), I couldn't help but noticed how much dust lay on the frames.  The staff was attentive.  We were brought our drinks & water very quickly.  Although I had to have them take my water back because there was lettuce floating in the water.    When my new water & glass (?) returned lettuce-free, we ordered.  My husband, as expected, ordered the Jager Schnitzel.  I decided to try something I'd never had & ordered Beef Gulasch (roughly translated: Beef Goulash).    Our food arrived in about 20 minutes.  First thing we noticed was how small the Schnitzel portion was.  Wasn't much bigger than my husbands palm. After my husband took his first bite, I could tell he wasn't impressed.  I tried it also.  The breading was not crispy & it tasted like unflavored panko bread crumbs.  The Wild Mushroom Demi that was on top was really salty.  As was the green cabage that came as one of the sides.  My Gulasch was served in a bowl, which was appropriate.  I was expecting  some vegetables or pasta in the bowl, not just meat and a couple mushrooms.  The gravy tasted like jarred brown gravy with a few sauteed mushrooms thrown in.  My husband suggested mixing the meat & gravy with the pasta that came on the side called Schwabische Spatzle.  Sounded like a good idea since the noodles were extremely dry.  Once I mixed the two together, it still wasn't that good.  Our final impression?  Just barely ok!  The restaurant interior is old and weary looking.  The food portions were small.  The food taste was either very bland or too salty.  The temp of the food was lukewarm.  All in all, this restaurant was nothing special, and certainly nothing about the food or atmosphere would make us go back!",

The atmosphere at Haus Murphy's is very nice out on the patio (i didn't make it inside) and down town Glendale adds to it's ambiance.  So let's get to the Reuben. Average, and over priced at $9.95. It came with German potato salad that i like but for the price and service I don't think I will be back for lunch. When you consider that wholesale corn beef cost $3.49 / pound and they put less than a 1/4 pound on the sandwich it was very disappointing. And the German potato salad was good but come on potatoes are cheep. Is it just because Glendale is a high rent district? Well the Haus of Murphy may have a lot going for it but it's not going to win over the casual lunch crowed that's for sure.",

    "text": "Haus Murphy's was my first German food experience ever. The cuisine was OK but it isn't something I'd shove people down to get to.   I went with a friend who lived in Germany for a bit and he said that Murphy's wasn't quite up to par.   We ordered the sausage sampler as an appetizer. The sausages were tasty, but they were a bit cold. For something that is labeled a \"sampler\", I felt disappointed with only two types of sausages served in it. I don't know for sure what types they were, but they didn't taste unique to me, as it seems like you can purchase them in the meat section of any supermarket.   The sausages were served with three types of condiments. A sweet style mustard, a Dijon style mustard, and ketchup blended with curry, which I'm told is a recent favorite of the German kids brought over from Turkish immigrants.   For our entrees, we all had some type of schnitzel. That same friend told me to try the Wiener schnitzel as it is the representative item when you think of German cuisine. So all our schnitzel's came out and mine was the blandest. My friend's schnitzels had different gravies, toppings, and stuff and my poor little Wiener schnitzel was just bland and all alone. You have to get that Wiener schnitzel wet with gravy !   No biggie, I'm a foodie so I'll eat it. A schnitzel is basically German country fried pork. Not super exciting. I copied my friend who lived in Germany and substituted potatoes on the side for spatzle, as I wanted this experience to be as authentic as possible. I don't know if it's just Haus Murphy's, but the spatzle was kind of bland, even with the gravy.   I do however like the word spatzle. If I ever visited Germany, I would only say spatzle, to everyone. I also liked the other thing that was served with the entree. It was kind of like a mashed potato mixed with some creme sauce, onions and some kind of green vegetable or herb (probably spinach).   The beer here was good authentic German beer. I didn't get drunk, but I still don't remember what kind I had, you'll have to experiment.   Service was excellent. I read some reviews that said Murphy's was slow but everything came out quickly and evenly for us. The waitress was very friendly and they spoke lovely German (not that I speak ANY German, but it sounded sexy). She was very helpful in describing everything, from the food to the beer.  I ordered a BAP (big ass pretzel) to go. Philly is known for some pretty good pretzels and this BAP was good. It was expensive, but it came out warm, soft & chewy. The only thing is they went a little heavy on the salt.   To steal and modify a quote from a Seinfeld episode: \"That big ass pretzel made me thirsty\"!    Note* They don't actually have it on the menu as a BAP.  Would I return to Murphy's? Ehhh, yeah to try some of the other things, but I definitely can't see it as a place that I would be a regular at.",

Though I must admit I tend to order the Schweizer Schnitzel, which has Ham and Emmanthaler cheese under the breading.  We've had the desserts in the past and the Strudel is very memorable, as well as the german chocolate cake.  Maybe this year we'll make it out for their actual Oktoberfest celebration, we've been meaning to go for years.  When I think of glendale I don't think of Germans, but this place makes me more and more want to take a vacation to Germany.",

Sitting on the patio on a warm (or cool) day enjoying the cuisine and the company of friends.  And great steins of beer.  There are several from which to choose ranging across the German spectrum.

I'm always skeptical of reviews because you never know if it's someone who never had German food, someone who's been to Germany once and thinks only the food they tried was authentic, or real Germans who are biased towards their regional tastes.   My opinion is that the food here is usually great but can be hit or miss. Be sure you are prepared to spend some time at the here. It's not a place to stop in for a \"quick\" bite for dinner.    Oktoberfest is a blast at this location and I try not to miss it. They've had the same band flown in from Germany the last few years and they are a riot.",

The layout of this restaurant is very strange, but I kind of like that they separate the large groups from the smaller groups of diners.  The staff, especially our server, was extremely accommodating and put up with our certainly frustrating antics of playing board games on the dinner table.    I was pretty hungry when we got here, so i decided to order something on the heavier side and went with the gnocchi.  The gnocchi were lightly pan fried and then drowned in a ridiculously rich cheese/cream sauce and sprinkled with chunks of pancetta and a handful of wild mushrooms.  The mushrooms tasted really weird for some reason and the sauce was too tangy.  It just didn't complement the dish the way it should have.  I did however, eat every last bit of pancetta.  Yum!  I saw a slice of German Chocolate Cake (no, it is not German in the least bit) being served to someone at another table and I gave the puppy dog eyes until we ordered it.  It came out looking rather impressive, but it went down tasting rather dull.  It was dry and lifeless and the only good part, the coconut pecan icing, was severely lacking.  Well, I won't be back here, especially after most of my companions were less than enthused with their meals instead.  Oh well, I guess that will make everyone else happy.",

Do you crave an outdoor seating area were the beer flows like water and the old men dance around in traditional German clothing holding tubas? You really need to check this place out. I live about 5 minutes from here and it took me a full year and visiting relatives to finally get to downtown Glendale to check it out.   We had a 6:30 reservation on the patio (It was a Saturday and I wanted to be safe but for 4, you could have done without the reservation). We sampled several German beers and I loved them all (wish I remembered the names). We started with the giant pretzel and sausage sampler-both were SO good I am still drooling. The Sausages were served over a bed of sauerkraut and the pretzel with spicy mustard. Everyone at the table tried something different and we all sampled everything. I loved the German potato salad served with the entrees and also the cabbage soup.   The ambiance of this place was fantastic! The live music is from 6-8 and I really wish it went later. My boyfriend and I agree that eating there really makes you feel as though you are on vacation-far away from Arizona! I would HIGHLY recommend this place-great spot for anyone and especially out of towners looking for something unique!",

    "text": "What a great place! Very cute, inside and out. We sat on the patio as the weather was beautiful. I was here with my family and this was our first time at Haus Murphy's. I'm always up for trying new things it was just a chore trying to get my dad to agree. We started with the Sausage Sampler ($9.95) which was really good. The only thing that would have made it better is if we had another type of sausage. I don't consider 2 types of sausage to be a sampler platter. I had the Schweizer Schnitzel ($14.95) which apparently is a Swiss traditional meal, tender Pork Loin wrapped with Emmenthaler Cheese and Black Forest Ham, breaded and sauteed with the Chef's Paprika Sauce (an extra $2) It came with the German fried potatoes - which are fried in bacon grease. Everything was really REALLY good. Now the food all seems to be rather fragrant as you could smell all the great food everyone else was eating. I was expecting it to be very flavorful. Like an explosion of taste when I bit in. It was not. The tastes of everything were simple which I think I enjoyed more than I normally would have. I was able to concentrate and define various flavors a bit easier than normal I guess. It came with this creamy cabbage concoction which was superb!  For dessert I had something that sounded truly disgusting but was WONDERFUL. The Sauerkraut cake. It is a rich moist chocolate cake without a hint of sauerkraut taste. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I will definitely be back. I think this would be a fun place to go with a large group of people! Maybe next time I will have to try some of their beer and definitely the giant pretzel. Oh and the waiter was superb. I think my mom even developed a little crush on him.",

    "text": "Haus Murphy is getting 4 BIG stars! Why not 5 you ask? Only because they are in Glendale and it takes an ungodly amount of time to trek out there. With that being said...   I have been to Murphy's 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely each time. I have never been to Germany or another really authentic German restaurant, save the German buffet at Epcot Center, so I don't think that really counts. The restaurant is on the smaller side and it can be very busy on the weekends, so make a reservation. They do have a nice beer garden outside where you can eat as well, weather permitting. They have a few larger booths in the front room, but have a large open area with tables and some community type tables in the bar area. I believe they have a polka band there on the weekends also. So if polka music is your bag you should check it out.   On to the important stuff. Food and beer! Again, their food has been consistent all 3 visits. They have a simple salad that comes with most entrees, but the dressing is awesome! The mushroom soup is great too! They also bring out warm, fresh pumpernickel and sourdough I believe. I have tried the chicken with mushrooms and cream sauce, the rouladen, and the meatloaf. I can't remember the name for the meatloaf, but that is essentially what it is. It comes with mashed potatoes and cabbage. It is fantastic! I believe it was served with a brown sauce/gravy. The offer a very large selection of beers. I have had the Spaten Lager and the Spaten Oktoberfest. Both quality. You have to get them in the large glass steins they offer. Lets keep it authentic folks.   The desserts are pretty good too. The Apple Strudel was very good, but does have nuts. If you can pick around them I would suggest it. The Black Forest cake was a little dry, but good.   If you live nearby or don't mind driving go and give Haus Murphy's a try.",

    "text": "Haus Murphy serves up a quintessential German experience. An authentic feeling enviroment with a selection of foods that not only a native could love, but anyone willing to step into a Black Forest story book will find tasty.  Despite it's Central Glendale location the place wasn't heavily patronized on our Friday night visit, still we had called ahead as suggested and set a reservation time. We were seated immediately, but were forgotten for almost a half hour. I  didn't realize how long we were sitting until my partner pulled out the cell phone to check. I was looking over the decor and commenting on the trinkets and chatting.When our server came to take our order they were profusely sorry and immediately put a large bread pudding on our food list, either to take home or eat at the end of our meal, whichever we wanted as an apology.   From that moment on there wasn't a lack of attentiveness at all. The first two things that came were a Filet Salad and a Sausage appetizer. The salad was divine! Here is the description straight from their menu:  \"Slices of Filet Mignon, Radish Sprouts, Marinated Artichokes, Asparagus, Green Olives, Roasted Red Peppers, fresh Spring Mix, tossed in Lavender Vinaigrette, topped with quenelle of Herbed Goat Cheese....\"  That's right, drift off with me....to that lovely description. The Olives were not oily, they were fat, plump, martini olives. The Filet was perfect.  A Lavender Vinaigrette? It was a WOW. But it's a limited time salad, so it may not be there when you visit.  Then came the sausage sampler. You no longer can choose the sausages you sample like the online menu states, and you get saurkraut not german fried potatoes, but it was still nice. They set a bottled mustard you can buy in any grocery store on the table.  I think it  would have been nice to have some sampling of german mustards for dipping. It was at this point that I noticed we didn't have a bread basket. I had read about Rye and Pumpernickle with a tapenade that comes at the beginning, so I inquired. Unfortunately this was a cost loser for the restaurant and they no longer do it. Instead they brought out three basic dinner rolls with the tapenade instead. This change dissapointed me as it's rare to get hearty breads and the tapenade doesn't go well on a basic dinner roll, they should just bring out some butter.  On to the dinners. It was so very hard to choose among the Schnitzles and Sausages, but we managed. One Nurn-burger Combo and a Schweizer Schnitzle later with a side of potatoe dumpling and we were quite sure we'd ordered plenty of food. The Tomato soup which prefaced our entree's was better than I expected. Neither of us like Tomato soup and both of us liked this one. I'd skip the potato dumpling side in the future it was a gooey mass of starch,  maybe we should have tried the Spaetzle instead.   The Schnitzle was really good and the sausages juicy. I think I could try a different schnitzle each visit and be pleased. I also might consider just a sausage and a bun. They will bring a roll for your sausage if you ask. The Wirsing was very tasty, I had read it wasn't so good, but I was thrilled with it. In the end we were quite full, we had ordered some drinks and had forgotten the large promised bread pudding. It arrived and we ate what we could handle while the Tuba and Accordian duo played their way through the restaurant.   A bit spendy, we hit $80 for the two of us, but we weren't trying to eat cheap. Careful planning could lower the cost. All in all it was quite festive and fun for an evening and we are glad we went. You should visit!",

    "text": "It took me a while to realize my vision of dining at Haus Murphy's. I first became aware of them from watching Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives on Food Network. In fact, I stole their paprika gravy recipe when hosting an Oktoberfest dinner party at my house. It was delicious over home-cooked schnitzel. I had to guess on amounts of ingredients, since Guy Fieri does the superfast play-by-play on the cooking process, but it worked out just fine. So I'm quite familiar with German food and have even pickled and cooked my own sauerbraten (sour beef roast). I had to try the sauerbraten at Haus Murphy's!  In a nutshell, I have to say that Haus Murphy's has delicious, authentic-tasting German food. The rotkohl (red cabbage) is right-on-the-money and the sauerkraut is truly fabulous. The sauerbraten was also very good... tender, slow-cooked, and thinly-sliced with just enough twang to wake you up. My buddy ordered the steamed smoked pork chops which were porkaliciously snarfable.  I do have some critical notes on what didn't work, however. The spatzle (mini noodle/dumplings) were uninteresting and watery. Didn't have the remarkable fluffy but chewy texture I expected (and yes, I've made my own spatzle). The sauerbraten, while delicious, simply suffered from being too tiny of a portion. I think even if they charged an extra buck or two, it would be worth it, but this was not a fair dinner-size portion. My buddy even had pity on me and let me share his pork chops (which were a generous portion).  So five stars for food and service and beer selection, but I have to hold back one star for residual hunger pangs. I will definitely be back to dine here again. But if I want to get full next time, I'm gonna load up on the pork! (As you may not know, pork is considered a vegetable in Germany...)",

When I was visiting the Glendale area we decided to eschew the corporate Westgate area for Downtown and a better decision has never been made. The Haus served us giant German beers outside.  They were large enough for us to take pictures of ourselves hiding behind them! What more do you want out of life?  Having grown up in the german-centric area of northwest Ohio, I have some sense of authentic German establishments, and this place has it in spades. Again, I'll leave the assessment of their food up to you, but if you're downtown and want to wet your palette with a giant fine German lager, you can't do better than Haus Murphy's.

They have great brews on draft- and teamed with the outdoor seating option is pretty close to perfection in my mind.    That being said, I have never ate any food item that someone deemed German that I actually loved.  I also do not eat anything made out of pig (so, your everyday sausage doesn't do it for me).  So, Haus Murphy's is cool and I'd go there if someone suggested it, but I personally haven't found a meal that works for me there.  I have tried the chicken with mushroom sauce and wasn't in love- just eh.    I will, of course, give it several more tries because of proximity and the presence of a beer garden in hopes that I find a food item that does it for me.",

They have a cheese schnitzel, literally the ONLY meatless thing I could find on the menu, but it was good.  The potato dumplings are really tasty too.  I think this place is worth a visit, even if you don't eat meat, you can have the cheese schnitzel and a humungous beer and feel like you're in Germany for the day!",

Hats off to our waiter Patrick for dealing with our large group. We took up two tables. He did a great job even with that many people. Sure it was a little slow but it was worth the wait and he did a great job remembering who got what. I felt bad bombarding him with that many people but he still did a fantastic job. I loved the food. And the large beers. That was a beer. Wooo good stuff. I got the paprika schnitzel on a recommendation. I can't describe how good it was. Words don't do it justice. Plus the boiled cabbage coleslaw stuff, whatever it was called, blew my mind. I could have had a whole plate of that stuff. Best GD coleslaw I have ever had. Lol. But put the schnitzel on another plate because I don't want to miss out on that either. I was full but wanted to eat more. So I did. The chocolate truffle cake was amazing too. Between the company, the amazing food, the awesome beer in the huge glass I had a great time. I will definitely be back with a large or small group. Even though it is a little far away from where I live it is worth the drive. I can't say enough about how good it was.",

For some reason that remains absolutely unfathomable to me, my mother in-law wrinkled her nose at it and ended up following the hubbie's stupid lead to Bitzee Mama's mexican restaurant, where she ordered a non-Mexican item because she doesn't really eat Mexican food.  Needless to say, Bitzee Mama's remains to this day my #1 trip into dining hell.  This time, the hubbie was more amenable to visiting Haus Murphy and does have that regret that he poo-poo'd it  ... 'my mom would have liked this place.'  We started with the stuffed mushrooms and loved them.  We both got schnitzel, me a pork paprika and him a chicken.  Loved both our dishes.  Only drawback, we assumed the german potato salad would be served by default.  The waitress did not ask, we did not volunteer, so we got french fries.  We did not get dessert because the pieces of cake we saw going out were HUGE and we were full.  It was a beautiful February day, so we sat outside.  We will definitely dine here again when in Glendale.",

    "text": "Wife wanted to celebrate the completion of a long term goal and a local friend suggested this place.  However, due to the cold snap we decided upon pho but couldn't locate the place and realized we were right across the corner from Haus Murpheys and decided to pay it a visit instead.  I will start with a disclaimer stating that I have no idea what good german food is or should taste like.  Really loved our dining experience here.  Deduct one star for the slow service.  But in our servers defense, she was helping out in two separate rooms and seemed a little over taxed. We started with the stuffed mushrooms and was delighted with the taste of the spicy sausage that came through.  Good enough that I could have just eaten a few plates of these for the entire meal. For the main course we split the Bauernplatte platter which ended up being more than we could handle.  So lets talk meat.  The brauts were great, rote being the better of the two imo, since the german one seemed a bit lacking in flavor.  The Hackbraten, aka meatloaf, was really good and pared well with the spicy mustard.  Next up was the Kassler, which was basically a thick ass ham steak.  It's pork, so, Awesome!  The final slab of meat was the schnitzel which I was surprised with how much I liked it.  Reason was that it was quite rare, which I wasn't sure if it should be or not but it made the texture very delicate and almost melted. For the non-meat items, the german potatoes were the best.  If only breakfast places could serve potatoes like this!  The regular sauerkraut had good flavor but was too soft for my taste.  The red sauerkraut didn't appeal to me at all.  Least liked was the spatzle.  I just don't get it.  Just little noodles of blah.    As if this wasn't enough to bring about a food coma, we followed it up with the sauerkraut cake since this is what our friend insisted we should try if we visit.  Chocolate nirvana.  I can only handle small amounts of rich chocolate so only had a few bites but it was seriously good stuff. Oh, and the beer.  Not much of a german beer fan since I'm into IPAs but the big ass stein of Octoberfest was pretty decent. Overall, a very enjoyable night out and one I'd certainly be willing to repeat again if we are in the neighborhood again.",

Several minutes later she came by and said the bar was backed up and she would go check.  In the meantime, she came back for our dinner order.  We both ordered different schnitzels.  Finally beer came, along with the soup.  Grrrrrr! After a couple spoonfuls of soup, here comes the entrees.  Timing and service was terrible.  Food was average.

I was honestly pretty intimidated, figured it would all just be big greasy sausages and sauerkraut.  I was delightfully surprised.  I would recommend the schitzel to those who are just ready to dip their toes in, it's basically just a breaded and fried piece of meat (chicken, pork, beef, whichever).

    "text": "It is as name suggests a German themed bar with all cliches thrown at it including traditional  music in the  evenings and all but it all gels well. It has indoor dining areas as well as patio seating. You can also chose to sit at the bar. The restaurant itself is located in Glendale downtown with plenty of free parking.They have a very nice selection of German beers on tap and they have a great range from blondes to.darks. The staff is friendly and courteous but not overbearing. I had a sausage plate which came with two sausages on a bed of sauerkraut with ketchup and two types of mustard. It was a pretty good meal for dinner. My friend got meatloaf with German take on it but it was just a regular meatloaf (where I took a star away). But overall they have great food and good beer. It is a nice place to spend an evening with family and friends. I would definitely recommend this place.",

A traditional German band leads everything from drinking songs (repetitive chants of, \"Raise your stein\") to dance events, stein holding contests, etc. You get the picture. But how they convert the back 40 of this small, downtown-Glendale, German restaurant to a beer garden is something to be applauded. The weather is perfect in late October, the music transcending, the food fantastic and the beer and wine free-flowing.   Well-done Haus Murphy's, well-done.",

The pork was cooked perfectly, while the sausages were on the dry side and the German fried potatoes were a little under done. The potato salad however, was fantastic as was the sauerkraut!!! The atmosphere is really warm and inviting with German decor all around and especially nice when added to the Christmas season.  Staff was very friendly and the service was quick. If given the opportunity I would gladly dine there again on my next visit, but would probably sample some of the other options on the menu...from what I heard from the other diners around me the Sauer Sauerbraten is to die for.",

This restaurant is old fashion with old generation German music playing and decor that would remind you have a country restaurant in Bavaria.  I knew after one bite of the salad that I would like this restaurant.  The dressing was creamy but light in a way that only the Europeans know how to do.  I would say the same about the cream sauces on the Schnitzel.  While having the nice flavor of cream it was light.  They serve beer the way it is served in Germany--luke warm which was perfect.  The waitresses wore traditional German clothing and I enjoyed the entire experience.  I also had the cherry strudel with ice cream which was yummy and reminds of something my grandmother would make.  This restaurant is not chic or fancy but it is homey and the food is delicious German comfort food.",

Even the salad served before was kind of sad. Wife had the chicken with a cream sauce that I tried that was rather good though we expected a plump breast not one that looks as it had been through a ringer washer but maybe that's the way German chicken is served . the the potatoes again were burnt and hard.Will say service was excellent.if we go back and right now that's a big if' we'll definitely try other items on the menu staying away from the fried potatos. All in all for the prices they charge we were quite disappointed.",

Busers should NOT come to your table unless forks are down and the check is on the table. When i spoke to the manager Jersey about this she was dumbfounded.

The roulade was delicious, however anyone who has had this dish knows that regular German mustard is a must. We actually had to ask for the mustard which came in Spicy German mustard. That maybe due to the fact that we live in the southwest region of the U.S. My wife is Austrian and she thoroughly enjoyed the roulade.  The  schaebischn Spatle was good. My Paprika schnitzel was great  I would definitely go back again. The service was a little slow, due to the fact that it was PACKED...... Guy Fiere Was right this place is right on the money......If only we could have real  German beer instead of the American version of German bier.. I would say that coming from an Austrian and an American who has spent two tours of Germany this place is the go to place for Awesome German-Ausrian food.",

My first visit to Haus Murphy I was serenaded by a tubist (Duane) and an accordion player (Elmer). Both gents were wearing short lederhosen and alpine hats (complete with a feather!) Perhaps entertained by my slack jawed expression they asked for my name.  And so I heard the song \"Good night Irene\" as performed by a tuba and an accordion. These guys are here on Friday and Saturday nights, 6:30-8:30pm. They take requests!  You should come hAngry. The food is served in enormous sized portions. The Wiener Schnitzel is perfectly delivered. \"But Irene. You haven't been to Germany!\" Heck no. But I've been to Vienna and have gobbled my way thru many a schnitzel.  Haus Murphy's version is tenderly prepared, lightly fried in such a way you want to forget about the calories involved.   I've had the good fortune to enjoy the indoor and outdoor spaces, in small, medium and large groups. The outside space is a wonderful venue to enjoy people watching. The indoor space readily accommodates larger parties. I would recommend coordinating in careful detail if your party is larger than ten. At my last visit for Int'l Supper Club the staffing was a little stretched for a party of our magnitude. We ended up walking to the bar to obtain our drinks, which wasn't really too much of an issue.  Haus Murphy's is a really fun place to visit and dine. Also, RSVP for holiday events as they fill up!",

On the other hand we did call in a reservation so perhaps a bit more preparation on their part would have been helpful so all of us might  have been served and waited upon in a more timely manner. Also, I didn't know it went against protocol to turn around and ask the bar tender whom was not busy to refill a soda. I guess it was since I was told that was my server's job and he would get it, apprarently if he was I woudn't be asking the bar, enough said. It was my first time at Haus Murphy and one of the best things about going with a big group is friends share. I ordered the Kilometer sausages, with fried potatoes and sauerkraut. The sausages were Hungarian, great flavor and so big they hung off the sides of the plate. I've never liked sauerkraut growing up but theirs I liked. My food was excellent and back to the friends and sharing, we exchanged bites, sausage for schnitzel, I tried a few, and every bite was amazing! I was getting quite full but since it's quite some distance from where I lived I figured I better try dessert. Oh bread pudding would have made the evening, but unfortunately for me but probably fortunately for my waistline they had just ran out.  I'd go back again, the food is definitely worth coming back for!",

The server wasn't friendly or knowledgeable, the food portions seemed smaller, the menu was also limited, and they took some of our favorites off the menu like potato latkes, etc.  The wait time of the food seemed exceptionally long, and when the food finally arrived it was cold.  If it was my first time coming I would not return.  I am sincerely hoping it was an off night as Glendale Glitters was in town, so hopefully the server was just new and the kitchen was overwhelmed with the additional customers.  We've noticed the past few years Haus Murphy's hasn't been the Haus Murphys it was years ago.  We are going to go one more time off season, and if the food and experience don't meet our expectations; we won't be back.    Please Haus Murphy's pick up your game, you used to be a stellar restaurant with stellar staff!!!  You were one of our favorite restaurants.",

    "text": "We tried this establishment for my late birthday celebration based on the reviews of previous Yelpers. What a find!!! This restaurant is located in the Glendale historical district. The parking can be a little tight; you can park at a few close parking lots - it's a short walk.   They have an outdoor seating area that looks fairly European. The atmosphere indoors is full of German cultural decorations as well. They even host Polka music on the weekends!  The wait staff was awesome and extremely friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. They have a terrific menu! We had one of their pretzels with cheese as an appetizer - it was huge! It took up the entire plate! You could split one of their pretzels between 3 to 4 people easy.  They serve authentic German beer, wine and cocktails along with a fantastic desert menu for after dinner.  I will definitely return for some authentic German cuisine and beer the next time we visit the Glendale area! A solid 5 stars!!!",

They had a good beer selection, and lots of food to choose from, luckily a few meatless things I could try! We sat outside on the patio and it was really nice. All lit up with little lights. Nice and laid back, wasn't too busy. Started off with a Bavarian pretzel and cheese spread. The cheese spread was ok, but the pretzel was delicious! I ate nearly the whole giant thing. I also tried the brie en croute which is Brie in pastry dough with fruit and fruit sauce. Perfect mix of sweet and savory. Really enjoyed my experience here,",

The potato pancakes were served very burnt on the bottom and saturated with oil, the schnitzel was nothing special to rave over and I had the paprika schnitzel and all I could taste was the flour in the paprika sauce.....I thought well I guess I will try the cherry strudel because surely they can't mess up dessert too....I was wrong because the dough in the middle was completely raw.  I was looking so forward to taking my parents to an authentic German restaurant and transporting them back to a special time and place in our lives..... so very disappointed!!",

Great atmosphere filled with a live accordion player, laughter from big groups gathering here, and the smell of yummy food!  Service was pleasant and patient with us, for we were a group of people who'd never had German food. Beer selection was great, and the glasses (or should I say goblets) were more than enough for one serving.  The food was amazing and hot, we ordered some type of sausage platter and 4 different schnitzel dishes. Not one of us could finish our plates because the servings were pretty large, so if you're a light eater, you could totally enjoy this place family-style!  Not the last time they'll see me!",

Food is wonderfully made with love from traditional recipes that have been passed through generations.

We had such a nice waitress who knew her stuff when it came to menu and beer choices. She even topped us off at the end of the meal with a complimentary candle laden cherry strudel. We ordered the Anniversary Platter, only $25, which included 2 schnitzels with gravy, sausage, sweet cabbage and sauerkraut, potatoes, and a pork chop. MORE than enough for two people! We'd started with the absolutely wonderful fried brie with sliced green apple and oranges on the side. The beers were great choices with the meal, him a Dunkel and me, an Octoberfest. The decor is neatly appointed and the atmosphere was casual and somewhat quiet.  Special occasion, family gathering, friends from any walk of life will find something they would like on the menu.  October gets kinda crazy of course, so more rowdy and crowded, but I think the food quality stays consistent.  Give it a try! Prost!",

I have never had poor service, their Oktoberfest  event is out of this world and always full so if you want a unique experience make sure to reserve this fall!  Their food is always amazing, always always always!  The only reason I said I hope they stay one of my favorites is because recently they have changed staff, I don't know how far up the chain of command that staff goes but they have messed with the menu a bit. They changed the menu but still has all time favorites of mine. But they also messed with the recipe on a few things. Like their Chocolate Sauerkraut Cake. It was amazing, it was the bomb! Yet my best friend, who is German, who introduced me to this location! deterred me from wanting to order it the last time we went in. She had come in and the cake was smaller and not as moist or tasty. If my friend says something isn't good I believe her cause she introduced me to this place which is amazing!  Hopefully not to many changes happen and I truly hope the Chocolate cake gets fixed cause it used to be amazing!",

It takes its name from Murphy Park, across the street but the food is so authentically German that I don't think they let the Irish in the kitchen.   By all means, get the giant pretzel appetizer.  Then try one of the amazing schnitzels, the rouladen or one of the German sausage options.  You will not be disappointed.  If you are are thinking Glendale might be too far to go for a great meal, embrace your sense of adventure and just do it.  In for Spring Training?  Skip the chains and go for a charming, local, family establishment with amazing options!  (Oh, and it's a Diners, Drive-in's and Dives favorite.)",

My date and I split the platter for two and found most of it enjoyable. Bland in some spots, though. I travelled through Germany and was surprised at the blandness and yet, powerful sweetness in some of the items.  I also thought the menu was really short; 2 appetizer choice, maybe 10 entrees. This seemed strange because I had read the menu on the way there and then saw none of the items I would have wanted on the limited menu. After reading another review (now, 5 hours since We were there) it looks like they limit the menu for Glendale Glitters. Would have helped to have known that before We got a sour taste in our mouths on the place already.  We said we would be back, but certainly aren't counting down the days until then. Maybe for Oktoberfest",

The pretzel was fantastic and the potato pancakes were ok, but not as good as my grandmother's.  I shared the combo for 2 with a friend. The sausage and ham were fab and the little salad was one of the best I have ever had. The ony thing we didn't like was the  meatloaf type thing on the combo platter.  The place cleared out pretty quicly Saturday night... By 9pm, people were packing up the patio.  Overall, it was a great time. I only wish there were some more veggie options for sides.",

The Rouladen, though not Mom's, was thoroughly enjoyed, the Brats, German potatoes, sauerbraten and spatzel were delicious. Desserts, wow!!

The restaurant was nicely lit so it wasn't hard to find.  We tried the Bauernplatte - Combo for two. So basically it has a little bit of everything on the menu...pretty good choice if you want to try everything they serve in one sitting. hehe   So the combo plate included three types of bratwurst, pork schnitzel (which is a flat piece of pork, breaded and fried), kassler kotelett ( which is porkchop), German fried potatoes, German potato salad, red cabbage and sauerkraut. I liked all three types of bratwurst, but the most tasty of them all is the kassler kotelett. This pork chop is very different from any kind of pork chop I have had...usually pork chops are pretty rough and not very flavorful...but this pork chop is very moist and flavorful...sorta taste like ham. This was my bf and my favorite out of the sampler. The pork schnitzel wasn't that good because there was no sauce and it was a bit bland. I wasn't a fan of the potato salad because it was sour...not a fan of the red cabbage or the sauerkraut but the German fried potatoes were tasty.   The beer according to my bf has a different taste and is slightly stronger than American beer.   The service was really good - - the waitress was very friendly and sweet.  Overall, I liked the food, atmosphere and service. =]",

Waited another long time for the ordered beers to come out. We ordered 2 orders of potato pancakes as appetizers . The pancakes were no more than 3 inches wide and maybe an 1/8 inch thick. A nickels worth for $7.95 an order. The most upsetting  experience however was after finishing our appetizer and waiting another long time(remember the place was nearly empty) the waiter comes back and said they are out of the sausages that 2 of us ordered. Where he or the kitchen were doing all this time while we were sitting waiting for our entrees to arrive I could not begin to guess.  Food was good but we will not be back due to the very poor service. The wait staff looked like they wanted to be somewhere else and did not enjoy their jobs.vgu",

    "text": "Haus Murphy, what happened?!  Our family has eaten at Haus Murphy many times in the past with great results, but our recent visit there was a disaster.  First, what went right:  our party of 7 was seated on time at 7p.  Drink orders were taken by our friendly waitress, although the restaurant was out of Optimator, the favorite beer of one of our party. Our food order was taken promptly after that and soup appeared a few minutes later, as expected.  The oompah band was fun, as usual!  What didn't work:  Our entrees were delivered at 8:30p, a full hour after the soup and 1.25 hours after our initial order!  When we commented/questioned the long wait, we received no apology from the waitress, but were told they were busy.  This long-standing Glendale restaurant is always busy so that reason seemed pretty lame.  Six of our dinners were then served.. The dinner ordered \"without bacon\" was served 15 minutes later, when everyone else was at least half done eating.  One of the dinners served came out with a kitchen substitution as they had run out of spaetzle.  Isn't that like a Chinese kitchen running out of rice?!  Ironic that according to the menu, substitutions are not allowed by the customer at Haus Murphy so you'd think they wouldn't automatically substitute either, but instead inform the customer when they are out of an item and let them choose what to do. The person ordering the dinner did so because spatzle is his favorite and therefore accepted goulache to get the spaetzle.  His preference is smoked pork chop - no spaetzle allowed for that entree however.  To be fair, two of our party really enjoyed their dinners (schnitzel and spicy brats), but the other four did not.  The waitress said she would ask the manager to stop by our table.  He did not so she asked him a second time.  The manager did apologize for the evening, the beer and food they were out of, the bad timing on service, and the unevenness of the food temps, but did not seem interested in hearing our concerns.  He was dismissive to us, but did remove the cost of one of the dinners in response.    We're left wondering how this could have been such a good restaurant, a favorite for years, that had so many problems.",

Lets start with beer. Yes, beer. German, imported, deliciously large beer. They sell beer by the litre for about $11. Yes, that's right, 11 bucks. For a liter of good German beer! Appetizers:  We got potato pancakes that were excellent! We were all fighting over them.  Good thing it was a large portion (good to share between 2-3 people).   Mom and dad got some variety of schnitzel.  They have like 20 different kinds, so I can't remember. It came with homemade spaetzle that was awesome! I got the home made bolognese. I can't pass up good home made pasta sauce. It was amazing. So worth it!   We ordered a few desserts to go (it is family dinner after all) and all were good- the favorite was the sauerkraut cake. Sounds gross, but it was awesome.  Definitely a must if you're in Glendale! They have an awesome patio/\"beer garden\" if you have a while to stay and hang out.  The service was excellent and the owners were just so lovely.  I'll definitely be back!",

We requested to sit in the bar area because we find it more lively than the restaurant area (and on this particular visit there was a polka band playing in the bar area).  To start, we had their giant pretzel. It was baked to perfection. Then, we elected to split their dinner platter for two (the one on the regular menu, not the one on the specials menu, can't remember the exact name). The platter included soup for each of us, which was a creamy chicken florentine - I am usually not a chicken florentine fan but it was really tasty. The platter was perfect to fulfill both of our Sausage and Schnitzel cravings. We also loved the potatoes, weird noodle things (?) and cabbage and sauerkraut that accompanied it.  We finished off with the Black Forest dessert, which was the only part of our meal that was a disappointment - it was dry and tasted like it had maybe been in the refrigerator too long.  We loved hearing the band play while we were there and were extremely satisfied with our Oktoberfest dining experience.",

She wanted Weiner schnitzel so I ordered that with sauerkraut instead of the German potatoes.  When we opened the container at home, the sauerkraut had a very strong smell. The Weiner Schnitzel was a piece of veal breaded and fried- no flavor- none. Both the breading or the meat itself. The sauerkraut was very strong smelling and had a strong sour taste. The other side dish was a warm cabbage & cream dish. It Was passable. It also came with a soup, not sure what the name was, but it was a brown thickened beef flavor with a bit of onion. Kind if sweet & sour?? It was okay. I didn't care for the meal and my mom said she didn't either. She said the sauerkraut shouldn't be strong smelling or so sour tasting.  As for the restaurant, it was empty, no patrons, but it was clean. I was greeted warmly as I walked in, but nothing after that.  I will not return and maybe others love the food, but as you can see from my picture, it didn't even look appealing!",

Their sauerkraut and spicy mustard was our favorite. Don't get me wrong, the sausages, schnitzel, ham, different potatoes, etc. were all good... but the mustard and the sauerkraut made a huge impression. However, I was not crazy about their red cabbage. Also, a big suggestion is to call and make a reservation. We hadn't made one and ate in their back room/bar area. There wasn't any air conditioning and so it was a tad warm back there. Also, they didn't have potato dumplings, nor did they have knockwurst or leberkase (some of our favorites). Despite these things, the service was good and the food we order was very good. I would suggest trying this place out. I know we'll go back.",

I ordered an Ultimate Reuben, and it arrived cold, nearly ten minutes after every one else at our table was served! Must have been forgotten in the kitchen. The server took it back to have it reheated in the oven.   Five minutes later, I tried it (four bites), and it was rubbery because of being reheated, gristly, and sliced too thick. I wasn't charged for the sandwich and was given a take-out slice of strudel for free. Not a great experience, but this is an example of how a restaurant should TRY to make things right!!! Sometimes, stuff happens.  The four stars are because I've been here before and have loved the food.   The Jager Schnitzel is to-die-for. Should have ordered THAT tonight!",

My boyfriend and I made our way over for a family members birthday,  and we're instantly charmed with the decor. There were flags from several nations hanging in the patio area,  and a giant pretzel statue that said get ready to lose that top button of your jeans.  We had a large group of people but the service was extremely friendly and responsive. Clearing plates and checking in on us often; which is nice when you have several avid beer drinkers in the group. The beer list was impressive,  and offered 32oz Steins for drafts. enjoyed a full bodied Hefeweizen.  We ordered Bavarian Pretzels and the Brie platter for starters.  The pretzels were wonderful! Definitely the gem of the restaurant.  Warm,  soft,  and the perfect amount of salt.  Yumm!  The brie dish was a little boring. They got the right melted consistency,  but there was no bread or really anything to pair it with, and the sauce didn't win me over either. For dinner I ordered the Kilometer which was 3ft of beef sausage. The sausage was spicy and had a lovely smoky after taste,  but it was a little overcooked reminiscent to a Slim Jim.  I heard similar sentiments from two others about the meat being dry.  It was great to see a big helping of Kraut on my plate,  but the side of potatoes were a bit too greasy and bland for my liking.  The meats are usually the headliner in a German restaurant and Haus Murphys were a little underwhelming. The food overall was a little bland for the price point ($14-$19 a plate). Come to Haus if you're looking for a damn good beer and a pretzel combo though.",

The food was great, We started with stuffed mushrooms, the sausage stuffing in them was terrific and we really enjoyed them, I had the Sauerbraten and my husband had the Paprika Schnitzel for our entrees. Both were flavorful and tasty and the portions were quite large. We did manage to save enough room to split a dessert and had the bread pudding, it was delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings.",

What an awesome place.  Very nice and spacious with a beer garden outside with a stage and the inside feels very homey.  We came on a Thursday around 2:30 and we got seated immediately.  We started out with their Original Oktoberfest Pretzel to share.  Man was that good.  Served with a side of cheese and their house made spicy mustard.  I could eat 3 of those they were that good.  For lunch I tried the Schweizer Schnitzel.  It's a pork tenderloin fried golden brown with black forest ham and swiss cheese on top.  It is served with a side of German potatoes  and Wirsing.  I've never had Wirsing.  It was cooked cabbage with bacon and herb cream cheese.  I'm not a fan of cooked cabbage and let me say I could eat a plate of Wirsing.  The whole meal was fabulous and our waitress was excellent.  I saw this restaurant featured on Triple D and I knew I had to try it.  I will be back to Haus Murphy's.  It's a long drive from where I live but worth it.  A great place to have authentic German food done right and with a great atmosphere to boot.",

My Jager Schnitzel was very good and high marks for the mushroom gravy. The potatoes were greasy and the cooked cabbage was mushy but tasty.  My cousin had the porkchops which were perfectly done. Her sides were edible but not fantastic.  They do a great job on the main dishes but the sides were only ok and need improvement.  Service was excellent.  I would recommend.",

If you're ever close by even if you just stop by for a beer and pretzel, the environment is amazing here. Inside the restaurant or out on the patio, especially now during the holiday seasons. It's a must if you're ever in Glendale !",

    "text": "Okay, this is for everyone who has complained about the limited menu during Glendale Glitters and the long wait time to be seated and served. First of all this is not a chain restaurant like Applebees or Chiles where the food is prepared in the midwest and shipped frozen to the restaurant. The menu is limited due to the volume of customers during the winter months. Try coming here during the Spring, Summer or Fall. The menu is expanded, to include the beer, and the crowds are much more tolerable. There are so many tables and chairs to accomodate diners so be patient, or come back another time, such as Spring, Summer or Fall. My wife and I have been coming here since they first opened, in their original location one block west of the current location. The original location was a lot smaller than the current location. They moved because of the overwhelming response of crowds loving the food and beer.  We realize when we go during the winter months they won't have all of our favorite food and beer selections we normally get. We know they will be busy and the servers will do the best that they can. If you were disappointed with the food, beer or service during Glendale Glitters, come back during the \"off season\" and you will not be disappointed. Thanks",

My table mates had the jaeger schnitzel and the bauernplatte for two.  The schnitzels were accompanied by a side of potatoes.  My schnitzel was quite tasty as well as the jaeger schnitzel of my tablemate.   I tasted the sausages on the bauernplatte, and, yes, they were good as well.   I was more used to the taste of the potatoes.   I believe they were lightly fried and seasoned.  Michael was our server.   He is German as well as the owner.   Michael was quite efficient and professional and friendly.  The decor is what I am assuming can be found in a German restaurant.  What a truly quaint place it is.",

The pretzel was not as soft as I had hoped. But the Kasespatzle with the Kilometer was amazing! The Kasespatzle tasted like gnocchi with a ton of cheese on top with grilled onions, absolutely delectable - a must try! And the Kilometer sausage was very savory and delicious, it paired so well with the Kasespatzle! I will get this again!  The Sauerkraut Chocolate Torte does not taste like sauerkraut at all, instead it just tastes like a regular chocolate cake, just slightly lighter.  I love that the place is decorated with a ton of German items and that they sing to you in German when it's your birthday!  Service was also great! And they have a traditional bar all the way in the back down the hall, and a beer garden outside with international flags. Great place!",

We sat inside so we could enjoy the smells coming out of the kitchen.. plenty of outdoor patio seating and a bar area in the back ..   Lots of variety on this menu .. schnitzel, sausage, potato pancakes and lots of things I couldn't pronounce..   We were started with a small bowl of \"paprika\" beef / veggie soup .. that was the most flavorful broth like soup .. we could have eaten a giant bowl it!!  I settled on the paprika schnitzel that was amazing, perfectly golden brown, served with paprika sauce (like a brown gravy .. so good!) and German fried potatoes.. huge serving!  My bf had the Kassler Combo for one .. with two kinds of sausage, pork loin chop, potatoes, sauerkraut, warm potato salad .. also amazing flavors!!  As if we hadn't eaten enough we split an apple strudel with whip cream.. the apples were a bit tart .. next time we'll share the cherry one .. so hard to pick just one ..  Well worth the drive.. food and service were great!! Limited Street parking .. park & walk.. would definitely recommend!!",

The parking is a hit or miss... because it's in downtown Glendale, you basically get lucky if you find something nearby or you just have to walk. Their window decor needs to be changed. Here we are in spring and there's still snowflakes hanging in the window.   The service is great! All the people that work there have been so good to us and friendly. They're patient and explain things if you have questions. Our first visit was fairly quick and our second was a bit on the slower end. But both times I've been, nothing has been missed and everything was cooked just right. So no complaints there.  The food is good! My favorite is the chicken schnitzel! It is soooo good! The pretzel is ok as well. The cheese that comes with it, is not. Most people think of a nice warm melty cheese to go with the pretzel but it's the complete opposite. The potatoes pancakes are awesome too! Def a place to try out!",

Of course, brewskis accompanied the dinner both times -- you gotta have that to make this a real German dining experience.  About the only thing that was a bit of a miss for me was the sauerkraut chocolate cake; I wish it could have been more moist, but it still served as an OK dessert. On both visits the groups I was with dined outside and it made for a much more relaxed gathering, even on the second visit which happened to be on a rather cold day; the patio heaters made for a comfortable toasty environment even then.",

Haus Murphy is both a sit down restaurant, as well as a Beer Hall/open bar area(photo), with tables outside temperature permitting. LOL. But remember, Haus Murphy is a laid back, sip your Hefeweizen, or Spaten beer type place. And, the service is also laid back, so relax and don't rush the experience. You'll appreciate it more afterwards.   We started off with some waters, given the 105 degree temperature outside; followed by a Weihenstephan hefeweizen $7 and some sweet German Gewurztraminer wine $5. We also ordered the highly recommended potato and sauerkraut fried dumpling balls appetizer. They were huge and outstanding, a must if you visit.   Next up were our dinner entrees, of a Wurst Sausage Sampler $11.95 and pork Jaeger Schnitzel $15.95. Both were incredible and way too much to finish (see photos). The one thing we did miss however, was their famous Sauerbraten - they ran out of the day before. D'oh!    BTW, the Sauerbraten was featured on Guy Feiri's Triple D show.  So note to self, you'll need to get here early on Fridays, or as they say... you snooze, you lose.   For dessert, we shared their Apple Strudel $5.95. It's served warm, with a little whipped cream on the side. It was not overly sweet, but tasted just right.   Our meal came to an insanely fair $65.50 (before taxes and gratuities), given their overly generous serving size. Just way too much rich food to finish.   BTW, a post script on the house entertainment. They have an Accordion player who comes around to your table. He's a real hoot, his playing range extends from \"Roll Out The Barrel\", \"The Chicken Dance\", \"Que Sera Sera\" to... get this: \"The Wheels on the Bus\". Funny stuff!  Enjoy!",

Great German beer choices.  They serve a wheat beer with no hops.  Being allergic to hops, it's nice to have that option.  They have several schnitzels to choose from and the saurbraten is greatt.  Everything on the menu is tasty.  You have to try the sauerkraut chocolate cake for dessert.  The sauerkraut makes it so moist.  Trust me.     This is comfort food.  You wont' find much in the way of diet foods here.  If that's what you're looking for, then you'll have to go elsewhere.  There are no gluten free items on the menu as far as I know.  Otherwise, I think you'll love it.  Quaint and homey.",

Set in Old Town Glendale one may not think to look for this gem.  I recommend the Jager Schnitzel: Mushrooms in brown gravy with a delightful piece of fried pork....hungry yet?  My husband swears by the sausages, and beer served here. I agree with him on the beer...You are allotted a GIANT beer (if so desired, and frankly who wouldn't desire this?) with lovely flavor.  The staff is friendly and helpful. Check this one out! Zer Goot!",

Not even a crust of bread on the table to begin with. We ordered the sausage sampler and potato pancake. Very average and overpriced for sausage. We ordered sauerbraten to share and glad we didn't order anything else. The meat was tough, bland and was not cooked in any sauce to make it tender. Thick cut slabs with sauce poured over top. I expected fork tender and this was just plain awful. Staff never asked us how our food was and had to flag down waiter for another drink. Will not be back.",

Love, love, love, the horseradish for dipping and you cant get upset with a place that serves 32oz beers. The glasses are bigger than my head. I can never finish it. My love and I made an appearance here on date night last week, so our dining was casual with drinks. Bradford was our server. He was fantastic. They close at 9 during the week but, were good sports and stayed open until we were finished with our drinks. Bradford invited us back on the weekend for live bands (which Joe and I LOVE.) Love going here great service, great people, great food.",

I made the mistake of not calling ahead today, assuming that I could trust the information they list on restaurant, review, and social media sites. When I called to inquire after arriving to a darkened and empty restaurant I spoke to a very rude employee who informed me of their sporadic schedule, opening at 4 PM on random days for random reasons, opening at 12 PM on other days for other reasons. When I mentioned that they should include that information online, he replied as sarcastically as can be, \"Yeah, we'll get right on that.\" If their food is anything like their customer service and spotty hours, I'd stay far, far away.",

Even if German food isn't your favorite (I dislike saurkraut and cabbage), the service and food is great.  The service was wonderful. I was almost 2 hours earlier than my friends, so I used a table in the bier garden to do some work on my computer (with my own mobile hotspot. . . Haus Murphy's does not have wi-fi). The entire staff made me feel welcome as a sipped a wonderful German beer and did some work.  My friends showed up, we had great dinners, and then we continued on to Glendale Glitters. If I'm able to make it over to Glendale from my home in Mesa for Glendale Glows in January, I will certainly stop in Haus Murphy's.   Authentic German or not (I've never been to Germany, my friends of mine who have seemed to really enjoy the food too), this place is worth the visit.   Enjoy!",

But at any rate the service was A+ the food was A++ and the Entertainment sublime.  Just what you would want from a German Restaurant.  Reminded us of the places we'd eat at in Chicago...!   We had the appetizer 'Fladenbrot Pizza' what a great combination of flavors!  Then on the 'Brie en Croute'...another triumph! followed by their signature 'Giant Pretzel' and GIANT it was. A couple of the diners had the \"Best\" seller, Jager Schnitzel, one had the Steak Schnitzel, and I had the Nurnberger/Kassler (combo for one).  The consensus of the table was mine was THE BEST...although they all would have ordered their entree again for sure.!  The pork chop on my plate was perfection!  The bratwurst...well...just like I used to get in Wisconsin...oh the memories of Wisconsin.  Sorry to digress...!   The meal, the service, the entertainment...well worth the drive from North Scottsdale.  I can't wait to do it again!",

We both got the sauerbraten and red cabbage and the meat is so tender you can cut it with a fork.......and we did!  Red cabbage needed to be a little more 'tart' for us but realize that everyones recipe is different. Our waitress was very knowledgable about the beers and most helpful in explaining and answering our questions. Only complaint I have is the hostess. She asked if we wanted to sit outside, hot day so I said only if we can be in the shade. No shade - she she seats us in the bar area.   Had I realized this before - it was our first time there - I would have insisted that we were seated in the nice part of the restaurant. She was a little snippy when I said we should go inside due to the heat.  And yes we had reservations.  We will go back.......as the over all experience was good.",

    "text": "I wish I could give separate stars for food and service. This place was very busy when we walked in, as it was Glendale Glitters. We expected to wait for a table, but were pleased when we were seated immediately. We ordered the sampler for 2 and drinks. I also wanted a salad, and the sever told me it was $2, which seemed reasonable. Our drinks arrived, and we settled in to our outdoor seat. The German band was a nice touch, and the heaters kept us toasty. Our food arrived soon after we finished hubby's soup and my salad. As the food runner approached, time slowed down to slow motion. He almost slid the entire plate on my lap but, instead, he reached to balance the plate and knocked over my full soda. On my lap. On the cold patio. I was not angry about the spilled soda--I was a server forever, and these things happen. I could tell this kids was freaked out, and we felt bad for him. He grabbed some napkins, apologized profusely, and then almost took off when I asked him for a refill on soda. He brought me a refill, but left our table a complete mess. We cleaned up as much as we could, and covered the ice left on our table with a bunch of napkins. I was soaked and our table was trashed. Our server came over and brought more napkins, but did not clean up our table until prompted. Pretty strange. Also, we ordered a sampler type meal, and no one really told us what was what on the plate, so we didn't know what we were eating. The food was quite good. I can't really tell you what exactly it was, but it was a huge portion for us.    Our server also apologized but nothing else happened. If this would have happened when I was a server, I would have asked the manager to stop by the table and offer to at least buy dessert, if not the entire check. I was soaked; this wasn't a couple of drops. If you read my other reviews, I am not one to expect free food, but if there ever was a time, this was it. But, nothing was com'd. In fact, the side salad I ordered was $4 instead of $2.",

    "text": "If this is what all German food tastes like, then consider me a fan.  I was in Phoenix to celebrate my birthday with family, and we sort of found our way here by accident.  The decor is very charming -- as though a group of German grandmothers decided to put up every picture frame and knick knack they had -- and the service is prompt and very pleasant.    For starters, we the pastry-wrapped brie with lingonberry jelly -- a HUGE hit with the family.  The pastry crust was crisp, the brie melty and gooey, and the lingonberry jelly served as the perfect sweet complement to the cheesey, savory flavors.  Even my sister, whom I consider a pretty picky eater, loved it.  For the main course, it was schnitzel all around!  My mom ordered the Schweizer Schnitzel (pork wrapped in Emmentaler cheese and ham), which she really liked, but wished she had ordered a sauce to come with it.  My sister had the Paprika Schnitzel, which was actually a lot sweeter than she had expected, but again, very tasty.  I had the Holstein Schnitzel (fried egg, anchovies, and capers), which was everything I had hoped it would be.  Dad changed things up by ordering the Beef Roulades, which he simply could not stop eating.  I don't even remember him talking while food was on his plate, to be honest.    I ordered a litre of the Hefeweizen they had on tap in hopes that I'd get the infamous glass boot, but unfortunately they were saving all the boots for the upcoming Oktoberfest, and so I just got a huge regular-shaped glass instead.  I'm not really a big beer drinkers, and so without the novelty of the boot glass, downing that much beer wasn't as much fun as I'd wanted (especially since I was the only one drinking), but I don't fault them for that policy.  I'll just have to go back some other time!    All in all, a very good, fulfilling meal.  A very cute restaurant nestled in a charming area of old Glendale, Haus Murphys is a refreshing escape.",

The decor: everything German. You feel like you are at grandma's with the mix matching plates and wooden chairs. Lots of cheesy German posters on the wall.   The staff: very friendly. They close at 9 and we left close to 10. They were very nice about it and didn't kick us out. The server was willing to multiple checks for the couples in the goup. The service was a bit slow but it might have been because we were a big group. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu which was helpful.    food: everyone on Yelp raved about the big pretzel ($5) so we had to do it. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I think I had it  hyped up in my head that it did not meet the expectation. Others loved it. Also tried the stuffed mushrooms. Only 4 come in a an order for $10. That was disappointing but they were good. We got the veal sausage ($11) and the filet medallions ($16). My fiance loved his veal sausage and I only kind of liked my dinner. The brown sauce was pretty heavy and medallions were not med. rare as promised - more like medium. Every meal also comes with a soup. It was not so good but I like the concept. Maybe just not my taste. My meal also came with mashed potatoes (yum) and red cabbage (super yum).   drink: the steins of beer were 1 liter. Translation - an S ton of beer for $8!",

I can get beer in a stein the size of my head? Surely you jest. I have a rather large melon. It is True though. The effer is huge and tasty.  I finally got to eat here with my favorite collection of Brite girls. The whole place feels rather authentic though I have never been to  Germany so what do I know? Everything I know about Germany I learned from Polka and online pornography (I think they love the Hoff).   Community tables were not uncomfortable as they can be other places. They were quite cozy and enjoyable in fact.  The food while unpronounceable was very delicious. In fact I have been told that my opening line means \"It's delicious\" however as previously stated I know nothing of German so it could very well mean *insert funnt profane thing here*  Sauerkraut has become one of my favorite things in the world  and It does not disappoint here. The sausages were delicious and the beer made it all just a happy dining sort of day.  Also how can you go wrong with two old men in lederhosen playing the oompah oompah on a tuba and an accordion. These guys are rock stars. You learn to play these instruments solely to get chicks.  Srsly...I know you uppity east sider kids like to stear clear of the avenues except to take in some hipster-slumming it culture, but downtown Glendale has so much to offer. Haus Murphy's is amazing and it is nestled amongst little antique shops and whatnot with brick and lace and charm. Give it a shot.   Tell them \"Du hast meine Katze auf dem Fenster geworfen!\"",

We both ordered the sauerbraten. This is where they lost me a bit. The spatzle didn't have any flavor, we wanted to try the potato dumplings, but unfortunately those are not available on the lunch menu, I should have checked that. The red cabbage was spot on. The Sauerbraten itself was just ok. I make my own at home from a 5th generation recipe passed down from my husband's German family. Theirs tasted nothing like mine, so while it wasn't what I expected, it wasn't bad either, just very sweet, and not enough of the sour vinegar kick we are used to. On the other hand my son enjoyed it which was unexpected, since he won't eat mine. I'd come here again and try some other dishes and maybe at dinner to try the dumplings.",

    "text": "Wow the sausage selection here is killer! When we arrived, a German style band was playing. Unfortunately, they were replaced by an excellent female singer.... Just doesn't do the mood. Definitely got to order a boot.. A very cute large glass of beer that require a debit card to order. Our favorite sausage was the kilometer... Large, smokey, delicious. We also like the spicy rote and sweet Guinness sausage. I don't normally like sauerkraut but I loved the sauerkraut! Subtle, tasty, keeps me coming back for more! The beer was great also. I'm a dark stout lover so the celebrator was perfect! We came here because it was a tradition... For being my first time, I would come back. It is a very cool, casual ambiance with staff dressed in kinda traditional garb. Give this place a try, just don't come here for a special occasion except ocktberfest!",

We love this place because the food is phenominal, the atmosphere is friendly and they serve some of our favorites, like the german salad and schnitzel, but they have changed their menu. Green beans there were fantastic, and they traded them for boring mushrooms. They did have an unbelievable beef gulosh which is now beef and pork...I don't know what is up with all the changes, but why rattle your frequent customers by switching from perfection which is why we keep coming back? Oh, and if you haven't tried Schofferhauffer...its a grapefruit flavor beer that tastes like summer, fabulous.",

    "text": "I'm always up for new experiences, but this one had to be one of the worst experiences of my life. First the service was slow. Then the service became nonexistent. They were not busy the time I went and my server was uncaring and absent most of the time. Our server brings our drinks and wanders off to other tables, not even asking if we were ready to order at that point, which we of course were. Just plops down the drinks and leaves without a word. Once it came to ordering, our server kept writing down different food than we ordered. I can see if the restaurant was overcrowded and busy, but it wasn't. I had a reservation at the time that the restaurant had open for business on a weekday.    So we get our food. I ordered the Wiener schnitzel and it was terrible and cold. How can fried food become cold unless it had been sitting for over a half an hour? Our server later shows up when we're more than half done with our meal and asks if we want refills. I say yes, so she takes both of our drinks and walks off. She never returned with them. About 10 minutes later, after we're both finished eating, she comes by asks how everything is going, unaware to the fact that there are no drinks on the table at all. We asked for our drinks and she quickly ran to the back to fill up our drinks. She brings them back and does not say anything to us; she walked to another table to go help them.  After what happened I will not be going back to this restaurant. I really wanted to like this place. I have read so many good reviews and watched an episode of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network that featured this restaurant and it looked and sounded so amazing. The atmosphere was okay, the tables are really close together. The tables were small and clustered as well. I must have walked in on the wrong day because the experience was terrible.",

    "text": "Sunday was my friend Dave's anniversary, sadly his wife passed away in December.  We had a memorial for her Saturday night, and Sunday Dave invited me to dinner for his anniversary, not that I'm as good looking as Kris was.  We decided on Papadeaux, but I'd forgotten that this week was Mardi Gras and they were packed.  Dave was lamenting the passing of Felsen Haus when I remembered that there's a great German restaurant in Glendale.  Having never been there before, I didn't have a clue what the name was, but Yelp, searching for German and Glendale, led me right there.  And after a quick call, we found out there was no wait and headed across town.  Dave served in the Army in Germany, and he really liked his meal.  He found the menu very impressive and enjoyed flexing his German language muscles with the staff.  His schnitzel was not the precise one he was looking for, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.  Me, I had the Tirol chicken, and was pleased.  I am anti-fungus and was able to avoid the mound placed on my plate, I should have asked if they were incorporated in what I thought was a sauce or were on the side and could have had them removed.  Sadly, I'm not a beer drinker (yet: we're going to Europe next year, that could change) and didn't have one.  Dave had a half liter of something or other and was quite pleased, said it was definitely like he had when he was based there.  Definitely recommended.  Very good food, excellent staff.  Well worth the trip.",

I found them to be a little dated with their decor and their food is usually cooked well done or over cooked.  Their service is A~OK.  Food feedback: Apps ~  Sausage Sampler, Bratwurst/Krakauerwurst served over a bed of homemade Sauerkraut is tasty!  Potato Cakes,  served with a side of Apple Sauce and sour cream was a bit overcooked very dry.  The Giant Bavarian Pretzel Imported 10oz. salted Pretzel is highly over rated and was not cooked evenly.   Meals ~  Their beef & pork sausages are all served over their homemade sauerkraut with German potato Salad or fries. Bier Bratwurst - Beef-Pork Sausage is good. German Bratwurst - Pork Sausage is bland. Krakauer Wurst - Polish spicy Beef-Pork Sausage is awesome!   Their Schnitzel's are good but again overcooked at times. I preferred their Steak Schnitzel topped with a Gorgonzola cheese and Roasted Onion Sauce.  Served with German Fried Potatoes and Bacon Roasted Green Beans.   Beers~ Spaten Lager or Weihenstephan Hefeweizen are best, you cant go wrong here.",

    "text": "We went here based on the Food Network show (Guy Fieri) in hopes of having a fine German meal.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed in the food and the overall experience.  Upon arrival we were greeted and led past the more formal dining areas to the bar area in the back of the restaurant.  It is a large room set up with many long tables that seemed similar to a Bavarian beer hall.  The tables were covered with vinyl I guess to make cleanup easier.  Three or four other tables were occupied plus a few people at the bar.  I imagine the room would be much busier during Octoberfest. But we thought it was kind of cool since it did create an German like atmosphere.  Our waiter arrived and while he was not rude he certainly was not friendly and seemed like he would have preferred to be somewhere else that evening.  He did not make any recommendations or inform us of any specials.   We ordered our meals and appetizers which were the Wienerschnitzel and Saurbraten along with one potato pancake appetizer and one pretzel.  The meal started out with a small cup of the soup of the day which was cabbage soup.  It came out slighty warm at best and was like a broth with a mild flavor and a few bits of cabbage.  Very bland and unimpressive start.  The meals came next and also were only slightly warm.  The sauerbraten consisted of thin slices of beef which was nothing like I remembered from visits to Germany. The flavor was mild and hard to understand why Guy Fieri raved so much about it on his show.  The Wienerschnitzel was greasier than I would have preferred but it was a huge serving that covered half the plate.  The German fried potatoes were good but would have been much better had they been hot.  The spatzel and red cabbage was as expected but unremarkable.  We finished the meal sharing a large slice of the Saurkraut cake which was the best part of the meal.  Overall the cost of the three entrees, two appetizers, one dessert and two small beers was $103 + tip.    We came with high expectations (perhaps too high) and left somewhat disappointed.  I doubt we will return to this restaurant.",

They do take there time bringing out the food and getting the check, so plan on being there for awhile.   We ordered a schnitzel, the swiss style one. Its kind of like a corden on bleu but with pork and it has some very suttle flavors, nothing over powers anything.  We would definitly go back and if you do go, make sure you get a pretzel",

We drove all the way from Queen Creek (about an hour) They were very excited about an authentic German meal. They shared the $35.00 \"variety\" platter to share and I had the Saur Bratten. The food was sub-par and luke warm. The meats were tough and chewy and the schnitzel was over cooked. When one of the German boys asked for ketchup the waitress asked \"what are you going to ruin with that?\" She then tried to tell them \"That's not what they put on schnitzel in Germany\"  and proceeded to almost argue with them about it.

Had sausage sampler with very good sauerkraut . Fresh pumpernickel and rye bread to munch on. Simple dinner salads.  Tried two types of schnitzel, both were great, wanted to order the gnocchi but they just ran out and then had the chicken Marsala which was just OK. They had two accordion players playing classic tunes like the \"chicken dance song\" and \"it's a small world after all\".  Mmm good polka music and beer.

The first time our group of four walked in the front entrance we thought we were in the wrong place.  There was no bar area in sight and who are we kidding, we were there to drink!.  The kind staff member let us know the bar area was down the long hallway, past the bathrooms.  Ah-ha, that is more what we were expecting.  There is also a nice patio area on the side that allows for direct access to the bar area.  Speaking of the bar, the boots of beer are a great picture opportunity.  I'm not sure who the model was for the boot, but that person had some very round calf muscles and very tiny ankles.  Also, when the beer in the boot gets low, drink with the toes to the side so that it doesn't bubble up in your face while you're drinking.  The appetizers are great to split with a big group.  The Sausage Sampler is one of my favorites for snacking; served with sauerkraut and mustard . . . YUM!  Other good choices include the stuffed mushrooms and soft pretzel.  Also, for you 24 fans, I think that Jack Bauer's older brother works behind the bar.  Nice guy!",

The dish was good but had too much oinon, especially for a kids meal.  The kids also the chicken strips and fries.  They enjoyed the fries but the breading on the chicken was not kid friendly (my wife thought it was made with rye).  My wife and I had sausage plates, they were ok but unremarkable. The potato salad had very large chucks of potato that I wish were cooked a little more and the red cabbage was sweet, not tangy, and could have used some more simmer time.

They do have some vegetarian options, but almost all of them were carb-heavy. (I need my protein too!!) Their giant Bavarian pretzel was, er, giant. It was warm and delicious with mustard. Although I am a huge fan of spatzle, the vegetarian version of Farmer Skillet (basically buttered noodles with some veggies) was rather bland compared to the gnocchi smothered in rich Gruyere cheese and wild mushroom sauce.  My dining companions ordered a wedge salad (a wedge of Iceberg lettuce = B-O-R-I-N-G), Caesar salad with grilled chicken (pretty good, so I was told), and bean soup (with hamburger meat).  The service was friendly, but I just wish they had given a bit more thought to fish/veggie options. (Or am I being ridiculous?)",

My husband is German and was craving some of the food he grew up with and he wasn't disappointed. We split this big German meal for two that had a lot of different food including: sauerkraut, sausage (2 kinds), potatoes, meatloaf and their horseradish mustard. My husband got a huge beer the the of his head! The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that I wasn't really into the food that we had I felt that it needed more seasoning or salt. My husband thought the entire meal was amazing though and completely cleaned his plate (he is more into German cuisine). My son really wasn't that into it (15 months old) so next time we'll get him the kids meal. We will definitely be going back as there are a lot of other things on the menu that I would like to try.",

Ham had a nice smoky flavor and was very tasty.   They had a couple of dipping sauces including dijon mustard (from a bottle) and a curry ketchup that tasted like your bottled ketchup with curry powder.    Schnitzel was overcooked and dry and almost rubbery. Spatzel was watery and almost tasteless. Potatoes were very oily and not very flavorful. meatloaf was soft and spongy and packed with flavor but I have had much better.  Overall - the things that were done right - sausage and ham - were very good but the  things that were not done as well were more of a dissapointment.",

If a customer doesn't finished their soup they put it back in the pot!!!  Then for my main dish of the basic German Brat I only got about two teaspoons of kraut!  I love their kraut too.  Then the bill came and they didn't even give us a discount so when we talked to the manager she finally did give us about 20% off our bill.  Never going back there AGAIN!",

I was super excited to enjoy it again and I wasn't disappointed with the rouladen other than the fact I was looking forward to the mini pickle in the middle that I thought was standard? Maybe it was just a family thing. I was not impressed at all with the spaetzle. It was flavorless. Could have used a visit to the sautee pan with some butter and spices. Definitely opt for the potatoes instead which are so flavorful and decadent! Potato pancakes were decent and the cherry sTruedel was very True to german bakery style. Service was just ok. I was bummed our server didn't go over specials because we overheard another server telling his table about them and they sounded delicious! Oh well. I'd say we'll try the specials next time but I rarely get in the mood for German food and its a bit pricy to be visited often.",

Parking was okay since it was Saturday afternoon, but having to re-park every two hours kinda sucked and the food was bland!! I have been to Germany, and all the dishes I had there were flavorful, and yummy...but this place? bland and embarrassing.   I met a group there to play board games and the staff was so nice and great! But the turkey sandwich with horseradish mayo was dry and gross. I ordered it thinking the mayo would throw me off but \"hey, it's a German restaurant, let's give it a whirl\" I couldn't even taste the special mayo! My homemade sandwiches have more flavor than this one.   I ordered the apple strudel hopeful for some redeeming quality to compliment the great service...0-2, again like the Compass Restaurant, the best thing about the dessert was the sliver dollar shot of whip cream.   This place was so accommodating and fun to hang out at, with really nice service...but I wish I could have something nice to say about the food.",

Hostess and server alike were warm and pleasant.  Atmosphere was pretty cool.  Walk in through a neat little beer garden/patio area (could see where this place would be great at night) into a very National Lampoon's European Vacation-like decor.  Clean, but not fancy (our bread plates were clearly from two different sets of china (one plain, one with elaborate printing)).  Overall very inviting and comfortable.  Our table was against the window facing Glendale Ave, so one could do some people watching...  Food was solid.  Started with simple potato pancakes w/ apple sauce and sour cream.  They were nicely seasoned and tasty, but probably frozen (nothing wrong with restaurants serving packaged food by the way... as long as it's good).  My wife had the chicken schnitzel which came out crisp-but-not-too-heavy on the outside and moist/tender on the inside.  The mushroom/wine sauce wasn't great, but wasn't horrible either.  I had a Big Griller (a rather phallic-looking footlong bratwurst served over sauerkraut.  It was quite yummy.  Strangely, the menu says \"Great with Curry Ketchup\", but it didn't come with any nor were we offered...   Just thought it was weird.  The price was very reasonable and overall a pleasant meal.  Not necessarily a place I'd drive to regularly, but if in the area, definitely worth a stop.",

    "text": "Whoa, totally don't understand the love for this place.  We met with a group over here and boy was I disappointed.  To begin, why doesn't Glendale have meters?  Why do I have to go out and move my car every two hours?  That makes it really hard to drink and sober up without drinking and driving if I have to go out and move my car to a new spot every 120 minutes.  That's not Haus Murphy's fault but it is something that will deter me from going out there to drink.    So we get in there and our waitress is awesome enough.  She is friendly, responsive, and helpful.  In fact, I want that waitress to come with me to some other restaurants (looking at you Fez) and show them how it should be done.  In any event, she was great and the only saving grace of this establishment.  Now on to the bad food.  I'm not German, never been to Germany, and my German culinary knowledge is limited to Milwaukee Brewers' baseball games.  That being said, food either tastes good or it doesn't.  I had the Wullwurst sausages.  They came out looking like fried Twinkies and tasted about the same.  No spice, no real flavor, and surrounded by a tough skin.  They were flanked by some purple cabbage that was unedible and some German potato salad that was some of the nastiest mush I've ever had.    Apparently unsatisfied by this gluttonous torture that I had already endured, I ordered the German chocolate cake.  Now, I know this isn't an actual German food but it looked good and I thought they might go all out with it.  Nope, again - not good.  Flavorless.  I was basic chocolate cake with a thin layer of coconut on top and some Betty Crocker frosting on the outside.    Sorry but this place was just not good and I will not be back.",

I would have given 5 stars but the service was very slow and they did not seem to happy to be serving us outside.  We generally had to get up and walk inside to ask them for food/drinks.  With that out of the way, the food and drinks made up for the poor service!  Tried the soft pretzels(they were out of the large pretzels so I had two smaller ones)  It was a lot of food and seemed somewhat average but not bad.  My aunt got an order of the potato pancakes which were outstanding! They were accompanied with sour cream and applesauce which added to the flavor.  I'm a real big fan of German beers so I had a couple of Dunkels which went really well with my appetizer.  When it was time to order dinner, my waiter recommended the Chicken Cordon Bleu Schnitzel which was actually pretty solid.  Later I tried a bite of the pretzel schnitzel which was even better!  At this point I'm a fan of the food and would recommend it just because of the food and German beer on tap.  The service was rather poor except for the bartender who went out of his way to make us some unusual shots.  I'm fairly confident they were spread a little thin so I would like to try them again on a weeknight or Saturday.   will definitely check them out again and will be back to try the veal schnitzel and some of the sausages.  Cool place!",

Haus Murphy's does it right.   If you're worried about whether you'll enjoy German cuisine, don't be. The chicken schnitzel with white wine sauce is an excellent place to start (if you need one -- if you don't, it's still delicious). Give it a try!",

Ordered 2 appetizers and an entree and asked that one appetizer was to be brought out with the entree.  Server took the order and then left.  35 minutes later I flagged her down to ask where the appetizer was and her response was, \"They are backed up in the kitchen with tickets this long\" and held her hands apart about3 feet. I let her know that they could forget about the one appetizer and just bring the other and the entree. She offered bread but I had to decline because I don't eat it. Later (about 10 minutes) the manager (?) came up and apologized for the delay and offered schnapps (looked like she had a few herself) and bread. I thanked her but declined on both. She said she'll check on the food and if it's ready bring it out. About 15 minutes later the food arrived. As always, the food was superb but not worth waiting an hour plus for. I don't expect any discounts but paying full price for a meal I waited for over an hour for is disconcerting.",

We shared conversation with the other diners and shared food as well.  We looked forward to going back.  The next two times we went, both servers seemed very preoccupied, looking everywhere but at us, \"forgetting\" to bring us something, not refilling drinks.  The place wasn't busy at all, they just seemed not to care about service.   Hubby didn't like Hackbraten and noticed that the carpets really need to be cleaned.",

They were out of my first choice, Sauerbraten, so I got the Nurnberger Sausages with Sauerkraut. The sausages were a little larger than they are supposed to be. They were not grilled enough and the flavor was way to mild, diluted one could say. The Kraut was somewhere in between the more sour Frankfurt style and the sweeter Nurnberg style. Our friend had the Gulasch. It had a nice sauce but the meat was dry.  But they had good German Schnaps (we had Obstler) and Beer.",

We were in a group of 6 so we started with a giant pretzel and bread assortment, both which were very good. One of the people in our party ordered the potato pancakes, unfortunately they were out of sour cream so she was overall disappointed with her meal. My parents both ordered the Jager Schnitzel, my mom enjoyed hers and my dad was not very impressed. My fiance ordered the Kilometer german sausage and really enjoyed his dish. He generally does not care for sauerkraut but really liked it! I ordered the Haus Made Bolognese and really enjoyed the fresh flavors. Our service was a little slow, which is not surprising with how busy they were. I would have given them an additional star if we were able to get refills without having to flag someone down or wait a long time. I would probably go back to Haus Murphy's based on the food experience alone.",

It really doesn't sound like the restaurant that we ate at.     We ordered the rouladen, Jaeger schnitzel, and schweizer schnitzel, our favorites from our years living in Europe.       The rouladen was tough and the stuffing was unusually chunky.       The schweizer schnitzel was deep fried to near jerky status.  Dry and tasteless.     The jaeger schnitzel was a little better but the gravy and mushrooms didn't taste fresh reminiscent of something out of an envelope.     There was no german salad and you were charged extra for bread.      Service was most amusing.  Our waiter needed a little more training.  He told us that Brotchen was German for stale bread, NOT.  We also heard him tell a neighboring table that all German wine was sweet.       We love German food so we try out German restaurants often in the hopes of finding one close to authentic.  Haus Murphy's is definitely not a German restaurant which could be alright if the food was edible.  Our recommendation is to avoid this restaurant.",

    "text": "Walked into this restaurant on a Friday night around 7pm without reservations, and were seated right away.  The inside was packed because of the heat outside.  There is an inside and outside area to dine.  We decided to eat indoors.  We ordered the sausage Sampler at $10, and were surprised at the size of the sampler, nice size.  There was around 3 or 4 sausages on a huge bed of sauerkraut. Since we ordered the sausages for an app. I decided to try the Goulash Meal with Spaetzle, and Sauerkraut at $14.  My husband tried a combo with some sort of pork, with German potatoes and another helping of sauerkraut at $16.  My dish was a good size and the Goulash was really good, lots of gravy.   My husband's pork was nice and tender, almost melted in his mouth.  It took awhile for us to get our meal, we ordered a couple of beers while waiting.  During our dinner live polka musicians were playing.  It was nice to get some German ambiance in phoenix.  Beers were warm, but that's what was expected. For two of us to eat, with app, and two beers our dinner was about $75 with tip.  It was also hot in the restaurant.  They have plastic over the seats and it was a warm night and we sat right by the windows, so it was a little uncomfortable.   Both my husband and I were sweating, so we didn't want to sit around after our meal.  The food was good though.",

Food over cooked and chasing our waiter for water and coffee, forget a refill, you would have to get it yourself. The surrounding waiters will not attend to you. The manager will walk by numerous times and not acknowledge your waiting so long for each phase of the meal. Also if you get there for a late lunch beware! If you sit outside and your waiter gets transferred inside you are left without service. If you bring this to their attention most likely you will get no resolution. How unfortunately as we have introduced this place to many and are sorry for the loss of this once nice place to bring guest.",

Waited 15 minutes after we  were sat, no one acknowledged us, even though multiple servers and the manager made eye contact with me. We were patient, a simple someone will be with you would have been nice. Another patron asks their server if he can help us, 5 minutes later he takes our order. Our appetizer comes out before our drinks. Not a real big deal for me. 30 minutes later, still no entrees. Our server walks up asks if we've gotten our food, I tell him no. He proceeds to tell us the kitchen is super busy. Meanwhile 3 tables that sat after us had eaten their appetizers and were on to their entrees. It was apparent as a server he forgot to order our food. 30 minutes after  our food arrived. That's an hour wait for entrees. The food was pretty good..My boyfriend asked for a refill on an arnold palmer, he didn't get it until reminding the server at the end of the meal. He was just a kid so I felt for him he seemed kind of busy. The worst part was the manager who sat on the patio and didn't help any of the guests or the servers, who all seemed a little busy. I could not believe how uninvolved or how little she seemed to care about her guests experience. At our work, our managers are always aware of whats going on, how long people have been waiting, if they are greeted in a timely manner and will personally talk to tables when those situations ever arise. I would never want to work for such a lazy manager, who doesn't take pride in the running of the business or ensuring guest satisfaction. We will NEVER dine there again!",

I've never been to Germany so I wouldn't know if its authentic or not but as a native I know its definitely not the normal AZ restaurant. The food is pretty good and unlike most dishes that I've had elsewhere. Some of its pretty tasty and some of its not so much my style. The standouts are the schnitzels, meat loaf, sausage, and brew. They serve beer in these huge mugs that are super tasty. There is also a couple of dressed up polka type guys who sing and play music throughout the night. My sister loves Haus Murphys and its always fun to go with her and try different things. If you are a fan of German food or German beer I'm pretty sure this is the best place you can go to in Arizona. I'd probably give the food a 3.5 but the ambiance and the killer brew and sheer size of the mugs deserve an overall 4.",

My boyfriend and I love the tomato soup, nothing like the canned stuff.It has some seasoning on it. The waiter was extremely kind and was happy we came by to eat there. We  have had that same waiter twice and even the other wait staff is friendly. How could someone not like this place.Now, I just need to try the schitzel clan.",

We really had a nice family dinner that night on our Scottsdale area vacation, and we have Guy Fieri's show to thank for the idea, and Haus Murphy's staff to thank for the experience.  My Husband lived in Germany during his time in the military, so this was a step back in time and memories of the cooking he used to enjoy from a neighbor when he lived off-base.  For our Son and I, it was just an enjoyable night out to eat at a restaurant we would not likely have known about had the place not been featured on Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives on the Food Network.  Don't shy away from the dark beers - the staff can help you make the choices.  The ambiance is a step back in time, but in a good way.  The staff is jovial and seems genuinely pleased by people who appreciate their food.  This is a must-stop if you're in the Phoenix area.  It was an easy drive from Scottsdale, and we would go back in a heartbeat.",

Haus Murphy has a wonderful array of German beers on tap and has the added advantage of being walkable for us as we are located slightly north of downtown near Manistee Ranch.  We were delighted with the homey bar area and the beer selection.  I had the Heffeweisen, which was light and fruity with a mild clove aftertaste.  My drinking buddies had the light lager and the brown dunkel in the big-gulp size (I kid you not! The small is 16 ounces and the large is a whopping 32 ounces). Did I mention it was a good thing we walked.   All in all a lovely, laid-back experience.  This is what a neighborhood bar should be. Please y'all, stay away from the souless chains at Arrowhead and patronize our local and deserving Glendale establishments. You will not be disappointed.  Oh, one other note --the beer is appropriately chilled for American palates and not room temp like in Germany --something we were relieved to discover after our stroll through the neighborhood (still 100 degrees at 9 pm.)",

If you've never been you must get the sampler for two. Gives you a chance to try everything. I am obsessed with all of the schnitzel, red cabbage, sauerkraut and basically everything on the menu. The soup of the day is always a hit... Oh we also love the pretzel with cheese, like I will fight someone over the last piece of that. And of course the sauerkraut cake is like nothing you have ever had. Delish. Take it to go because you're going to be stuffed after your meal. Love the choices of German beers.

German music on Fridays, though if you want to converse with each other its way too loud.    Cons: Outdated, dusty decor.  Someone needs to inspect and clean the out of the way spots.  Outside brick patio has black grime that hasnt been washed in decades. Food is basic, nothing exceptional.  Service was terrible.  Young waiter copped an attitude. Service was S-L-O-W.     We ordered a bread basket with our dinner, it came around dessert time.  Kind of cheesy overall, but this is Glendale. The bar for great food and cleanliness is pretty low.  And sadly i say that as a Glendalian.    Would be good for the owners to walk the floor and see the dirt in the crevices and listen in on the service.",

The bread dumpling didn't really have anything going for it. This, after tip, was $28? I didn't hear any German (other than the piped in polka songs), or see anything of modern Germany, just uncomfortable servers in complicated uniforms. With plastic tablecloths. I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience for this place, which is too bad. I've been searching for a German place in Arizona that works for me for years now.  Sigh.

Only downside was they were packed to the rooftops which is great for them & yay they'll be open forever I hope... but a little on the noisy side & they had already run out of potato cakes. Super sad faces. Oh well totally our bad. It was after 8 p.m. on a Glendale Glitters weekend. I'll be back & report back. Can't wait. I love me some kraut. Yum! Also apparently they had been on DDD but didn't know till we got there. So funny. I found the place after returning from Chicago & eating some German & Polish foods & loved it. So I wanted to come home & keep trying more. So happy I did.",

With girls in German dress which looks very sexy :)  Now, there was a guy John who rocked! Patient, polite, funny and quick. He would tell stories to entertain customers.  His manner to bow was so elegant. He is from Germany, so I was able to learn a little about that wonderful country.  I ordered the beef roulade and I loved it! I also liked how the portion was sized, not too big so I got no left overs.  It takes time for me to come back to the restaurants I've been to but I already want to visit that place again :)",

If it wasn't a Sunday night I probably would have drank like 5 DAS BOOTs, just kidding they don't have those, but I would have had at least 2 or 3 MASS of beers. One thing everyone talks about in regards to this place is their GIANT pretzel which is very good. I am a big fan of the variety of food they have and the imported beers you really can't find anywhere else in the area. If you ever feel adventurous and a person that likes to try new things, I would highly recommend this place. I don't live in the area but if I did I would probably be here at least 2 or 3 times a week, the pretzel and Uber would be my best friends.",

    "text": "We stepped into the restaurant on a hot summer evening dressed in shorts and tank tops. The AC  made the front part of the restaurant too cold for us so they led us to the back(this place is huge!) where our server happened to be named AC...least I think that was his name, little Irish Italian guy who does a pretty legit pronunciation of German menu items. He was super hyper and enthusiastic about his love for the place. He expressed genuine love and admiration for the owners, and the business they built, and he totally made our night.   Summer is the slow season in town as sweltering 100+degrees drive people away. It's a shame that this restaurant isn't always packed to the brim because it's located in a cute historic part of town within an old brick building and it has so much character.  The former business, which was an old soda/pharmacy/ice cream shop, was named Murphy's. As an homage to the former business the German owners, when they took over the location named their restaurant Haus Murphy's and thus we get a German/Irish hybrid named restaurant that causes a bit of disgruntled murmurs with German/Irish patrons. Descendants ask is this a German restaurant or an Irish restaurant?   This is a 100% authentic German restaurant. Once a year they reconcile the controversy with their name by making and serving amazing corned beef during St. Patty's day, and you can wash it down with one of the in house German beers. No Guiness! They stick to their roots here which is what I like. They know where and when to compromise with their food, and I'm glad they are stubborn about keeping the establishment as close to their German heritage as possible.   Sauerbraten was what we ordered. It was one of the dishes featured on Diners and Drive in and was labeled on the menu with a little icon to indicate that. The meat is marinated in spices for many days to achieve it's smoky clove scented flavor. It was really a delicious sauce which I tried to sop up every inch of. I also loved the spaetzl noodles. They were delicious as the noodles in chicken noodle soup, and they were equally as tasty on their own as a side which I used to sop up the sauerbraten sauce.  We finished with a slice of the sauerkraut chocolate cake. You couldn't taste the sauerkraut one bit and the cake disappointed us. The cake wasn't as moist as we would've liked and instead all the moistness came from the dense and intense chocolate frosting.   Overall a great experience, albeit a bit on the spendy side. The Sauerbraten dish was priced at $19. Yikes!",

On the positive side the waiter was friendly. I ordered the original German sausage. The potatoes were perfect to me the sausage was good. It came with a side of soup which was green bean and bacon. The soup was delicious even though I hate green beans but it tasted good so props to them on that. The atmosphere does bring out the German culture along with the music that is being played.

    "text": "I've been to Haus Murphy's twice now (once for my birthday, once for the World Cup finals), and both times were incredible! I have a lot of Germany heritage, and grew up in a VERY German area of Pennsylvania. When I got to Phoenix I searched high and low for German restaurants and this is the only authentic one I could find, and it does not disappoint.  The Service: Service has been great both times. Staff is very courteous, and the first time we went our waiter gave us the full history of the restaurant and explanation of German food, traditions, etc. He grew up in Germany and had awesome stories to tell.  The Food: I admittedly ordered the same thing both times I went: Weinerschnitzel. It was too good not to order again! The schnitzel itself is always lightly breaded and fried, just like it should be. It comes with German fried potatoes and Wirsing (a chopped, creamy savoy cabbage side dish that is nearly impossible to find in most restaurants). Both are delicious. Also the portions of everything are huge! My guests ordered the \"Schweizer Schnitzel,\" \"Huhner Scnitzel,\" \"The BIG Smokey Beef Brat,\" \"Nurnberger Bratwurstchen,\" and \"Rote Bratwurst.\" All the brats were very tasty, and most come with homemade sauerkraut (by far the best sauerkraut I've ever had -- my wife who usually refuses to eat it enjoyed theirs). As far as appetizers go you also can't go wrong with the Potato Pancakes or Oktoberfest Pretzel (HUGE - big enough for 3 or 4 people).  Price: Haus Murphy's is on the pricier side ($19.95 for the Weinerschnitzel), but that's really pretty typical for good Weinerschnitzel, and the portions are so large that you can make it into two meals. All the brat meals were $10-$11 and they have a good variety of sandwiches that are around $8-$10 which is good if you're on a tighter budget.  The Decor:  Very unique and eclectic German decor. Lots of interesting \"knick-knacks,\" paintings, etc. Many of the waitresses dress in Lederhosen which adds a nice touch.  Wunderbar: Haus Murphy's has a bar/lounge in the back called Wunderbar. We came here to watch the Germany v. Argentina World Cup finals and it was an awesome experience. Tons of screaming German fans all packed into a room lined with German flags and beer steins. It felt like we were in another country. They also have a ton of German beers on tap (including Stofferhoffer -- one of my all time favorites).  Overall, great food, great atmosphere, I HIGHLY recommend it! Excited to come back when they have live music and polka!",

My dinning partner ordered the original bratwurst and you can tell it was home made.  My order came with a side of green beans and french fries, the french fries I found odd, maybe spaetzle would be a better side.

    "text": "Wifey and I continued our quest this past Friday evening for a good German restaurant in Arizona.  I am pleased to report that Haus Murphy's is such and that we enjoyed our Jager Schnitzel meals.  Wifey also ordered the super pretzel to go.  Previous comments have already extolled the virtues of Haus and our experience would tend to support the more positive ones.  We were greeted outside and quickly seated in the moderately busy inside seating.  Our server was fun and engaging.  Service was reasonably quick and correct.  Pork and vegatible soup came with dinner and was pretty good.  The Schnitzel covered almost half the plate and was crispy and tasty.  Life was good.  This is the best German food in Arizona (that we've been to so far).  And a shout out the live accordion music.  The music was spot on with lively toe-tapping beats - Roll Out the Barrel and other familiar drinking songs heard in the beer halls we've all been to.  Of course it's all relative.  I remember back in the day when we lived in Germany we would get cravings for, what else?  Mexican food!  Luckily, one of the local Gasthaus had Mexican night every Thursday.  Being from Arizona, I can tell you that although it wasn't the greatest, it did have some spiciness to the enchilades and came with beans, Spanish rice and a salsa, and it made us happy.  So it was the best Mexican in our area of Germany.   And so, when we get those cravings for a taste of Germany and it's not Oktoberfest, we know where we can go until the next time we can go get the real deal.  Over there.",

    "text": "I was walking around during the Chocolate Affair and my aunt said she saw this restaurant on tv and that it looked pretty decent. So we went and put our names on the waiting list (the wait time for the night was one and a half hours) and we continued to walk around the chocolate affair. We then returned an hour later and they were still pretty packed and we finally after two hours got into the restaurant, we knew it was a busy night so we were pretty understanding of all the chaos the servers and crew were going through and we were patient and polite to all of them.  Our waitress was some blonde girl who wasn't returning the patient and polite manner. She was rude and condescending towards us. After about 15 min we FINALLY received the drinks we wanted (water) and our soup came out as well. My aunts friend who was joining us that evening wanted to save the soup to eat with her main course so she set it off to the side occasionally taking a few spoonfuls. The waitress clears my aunts and my soup bowl. Then she returns doesn't say a word and as my aunts friend reached for her soup the waitress snatches it, takes it away and doesn't return. Finally after about 15-20 minutes she comes back and my aunts friend said she wasn't done with her soup. The waitress then begins to argue with her saying she needs to speak up next time. But in reality shouldn't the waitress have asked? So the waitress leaves, comes back with more soup and plops it on the table. A bit of soup fell out of the bowl as she did that. Then she doesn't say \"sorry\" and just goes over to her other tables. The owner of the restaurant, a sweet woman from Germany, is doing her rounds asking how everything is. My aunt explains to her what happened and the owner even said \"we usually have problems with her being rude and snippy to other employees not customers.\" So she ended up changing our waitress out for a nice waiter named Chris (I think). He was absolutely so much better and he was so nice. Our food came out about 45 minutes to an hour after we had originally sat, the owner explained that the kitchen was incredibly backed up and that they actually had to close the restaurant down for the rest of the night. Dinner was delicious, I had the spicy brat and the german potatoes are amazing.  Our experience was alright, we knew it was a busy night and that our food would take awhile to be brought out. That one waitress just really needed an attitude check and understand that even though your night might be busy and a bit stressful, it's still your job to be courteous and kind to each of your customers. And we were nothing but kind and patient with her until she decided to be rude. But if you ever eat at this restaurant I recommend the spicy bratwurst and for your waiter to be Chris.",

So if you're into cheesy stuff then I guess you'll like the mushroom sauce over the chicken. The potatoes was honestly very soggy and gross. As for the sauerkraut, it was so nasty. The taste didn't even taste like sauerkraut... I don't know what it was honestly.. I'm disappointed with the food here.   The service was not that great either. Our waitress was very straight forward. I asked for more crackers and she literally threw it on the table without saying anything. She was very slow and not that attentive.   I would come back again but I probably get something different to try.... Maybe their pretzel cause it looked really good.",

My dad was always obsessed with this place due to his love of German food and the movie Murphy's Romance.   The menu has changed little over the years. When I was a kid I really liked the schnitzel they served that had ham and cheese on top, almost like a schnitzel cordon bleu. Now I enjoy the Jagerschnitzel whenever we go. The food is always just ok. Never mind blowing. Never terrible.   Now that I'm a grown-up, I feel like I should really come here more often to enjoy the beer garden and have some brews, but it's usually still a family affair, and there are fun places to drink closer to where I live. I like the eclectic decor and vibe, but rarely find myself drawn here.",

    "text": "Had this been my first experience at Haus Murphy's, I'm not sure I'd go back. The thing they have on their side is that they are, indeed, the only legit German place in the valley and the two times I've been there prior have been markedly different from my most recent experience.   With that being said, my visit on Saturday, September 29th, was pretty darn bad. The server's deer-in-the-headlights look of overwhelm should have been a clue, as this was also atypical. We ordered an entree to share, an appetizer to share and requested it to be brought at the same time as the entree, and an appetizer as...well...and appetizer.   After 35 minutes, with neither the appetizer appetizer nor the appetizer/entree (nor an update from the server), we finally got her to stop at the table. I'm sorry, but anyone with any experience in customer service knows that when a patron inquires about something like this, the last thing one should respond with is, \"our kitchen is short and they have orders backed up and...and...and...,\" but that's what we got. She said she'd check on the appetizer, and if it was ready, she'd bring it out. (I certainly hope so.) Shortly thereafter, she did, and in Haus Murphy's defense, it was absolutely delicious (the sausage sampler).   It was close to another half an hour before our appetizer/entree (potato pancakes) and entree (eisbein) arrived, during which time another staff member (manager? owner? I have no idea) stopped by, apologized for the delays, and promptly shuffled off again. Following our meal, the same mystery woman came by and offered us a complimentary digestif or dessert; however, dietary restrictions prevented us from accepting. Although not surprising, it was disappointing to see there was no discount applied for a wait of over an hour (nor did we receive the soup that was supposed to accompany the eisbein - but that's hardly worth making an issue of.)   I'd probably not order the eisbein again (too salty for me), and way too large of a portion. I'd probably go for the sausage sampler as my entree. Very well prepared with sauerkraut to accompany, and all three sauces were absolutely fantastic.   And yes. If you haven't had it, the sauerkraut chocolate cake is an absolute MUST. I don't care if you don't like sauerkraut. That's not the point. Trust me on this.",

Last weekend we went to see the Glendale Glitters and the lines weren't bad, we were really excited to finally give it a try!  We had all eaten German food before and were anxious to have a great German meal.   Little did we know what an utter disappointment was about to be served to us by a lacking server.   The German potato's were very bland, absolute flavorless sausages, the most blah meatloaf we've ever tried. The chicken schnitzel was by far the best item, however, it was just alright and not great.   I can't believe that we had waited so long only to be so completely let down.   The Italian restaurant a block away is fantastic, we'll return there the next time we're in Glendale for a meal.",

Last night we took an out of town visitor there for dinner to enjoy the beautiful AZ weather by sitting outside and have a few beers. They had their Oktoberfest menu which is about 8 entree options from their regular menu and 2 appetizer options. They didn't budge from this because when I asked for a side of spatzle I was shot down. Despite it not being packed they were also serving dinner on plastic plates because of the crowds we were told. We walked in at 6:45 on  A Saturday night and were seated immediately so that argument didn't really hold up with me but I didn't let it bother me.  I had the chicken schnitzel which was delicious! My husband had the paprika schnitzel and our guest the German bratwurst. A couple rounds of Spaten put a smile on everyone's face. We should have ordered the pretzel appetizer but we were smart and passed because there was no way we could have eaten that and managed to finish the huge portions they serve for the entrees.  The restaurant itself inside could use some freshening up but if you go when the weather is nice you can sit outside and not worry about it.",

And menu on this period is really limited. To enjoy the food and atmosphere make a reservation on weekends also.  Unfortunately I can't find a lot of things that I can eat there now since I became vegetarian/vegan ( no milk no meat) but they still could modify some of their dishes to accommodate my needs. Which I greatly appreciated!  All food there is delicious but I was stuck on my meatloaf lol. Every time when we came I used to tell myself that I will order something else but every single time I cannot cheat on my favorite dish. Lol I did grab a bite from my husbands plate every time and it's really good but my heart belongs to that meatloaf.  I think that's one of the few things that I miss since I stopped eating meat.  definitely recommend this place!",

Later when another party asked, he questioned bartender. Accordion music was nice. Food was so tasteful. However, when you wake up at midnight puking six times and lose your dinner, it's a 1 star. I didn't have alcohol as I don't drink so that is not the reason for gastroenteritis. Doubt I'll go back after this.",

    "text": "My husband and I used to come here often until we had to move away a few years ago.   We spent the last three years talking about how much we missed Haus Murphys and what we'd order when we moved back to town.   Well we recently moved back to the Valley and one of our first stops was to Haus Murphys!   I'd missed their schnitzel so I knew I was going to order one when we came in.  As we walked in the door we noticed a sign advertising their anniversary special which serves two and includes two types of schnitzel,  sausage,  kasser, potatoes and two types of kraut.  It also came with two cups of the soup of the day.   It sounded good to both of us so we decided to order that.   Hubby also ordered a beer and I had a lemonade.   The soup came out first,  it was a warm, comforting beefy vegetable soup and we both really enjoyed it.   Next came our massive special platter and everything was absolutely delicious!   Our favorite by far was the jaeger schnitzel which absolutely melted in your mouth and was accompanied by the perfect mushroom gravy.  It was an excellent accent to the schnitzel without overpowering it.  Although there was enough food for an army,  you can't come to Haus Murphys and skip their chocolate torte!  We'd been talking about this dessert for three years (along with all their other food) and building it up in our heads and I'm happy to report that it was better than we remembered!  It was rich and delicious and the frosting was awesome!   Oh and the service was excellent as well!   Overall it was the perfect welcome back to the Valley and we'll definitely be back again soon!",

    "text": "This wasn't a typical restaurant visit - we had a group of Toastmasters friends set up a meeting for 24 in the bar area, and we had a fixed menu for our group.    What I liked - fun venue, lively energy (live accordion music playing on the patio!).  The beer (heifeweissen) was wonderful (holy cow - the large comes in a stein that I could hardly lift!!).  The sausages, sauerkraut and schnitzel was fabulous.  Desserts (cherry and apple strudel) were decent.   They have a large bar area with TVs and lots of seating; an extended patio area and a front dining room that was a little quieter.   The servers were a delight.  However - it was weird.  They knew that our group would be giving speeches and conducting a meeting.  But they put us in the high traffic area in the bar.  The manager even bumped into the speaker (who was forced to stand in the walkway) instead of walking around, and gave us a look like we were in her way. It was just too darn noisy to hear more than 10 feet away.  I grant that maybe we picked the wrong location for a meeting.  But then why didn't the manager (knowing we were coming and what we were doing) put us in that location?    I'm sure this restaurant is a delight if you are just coming in for a fun German food experience. Although my hubby was disappointed about the mustard they provided. So I'm giving a 4 star rating for the experience that \"regular\" diners were having.   This venue is across town from us - although I love the downtown Glendale vibe - I most likely won't make the long drive to come back anytime soon.",

They used to have a superb german salad. They used to bring a complimentary bread basket with rye and pumpernickel along with real butter, alas no more. They just brought out out a watery vegetable soup and the waiter just said this is the soup tonight. It contained 3 pieces of carrot along with a lonely piece of celery but no flavor. My wife asked for bread and was told they could offer a dinner roll. Why go cheap? Offer the food that used to draw people in and just charge more. We all understand about rising food costs. I ordered a side of red cabbage that used to be so flavorful and what was brought out was so sweet I thought it was marinated in beet juice. Not enjoyable. We had not gone here for a while because they started changing things to the cheaper side. We went in hope of finding improvement and were disappointed. We will not be returning.",

We decided to eat here for Mother's Day this year, and were sorely disappointed by our experience and will likely never go back.  We made a reservation for 6pm and arrived about 5 minutes early with our entire party of 6 present.  We were seated almost immediately and ordered our food about 5-10 minutes later.  Our order included an Eisbein, combo plate for 2, and meatloaf, along with a giant pretzel as an appetizer.  45 minutes after we placed our order, we were served side salads, and a few minutes after that the waitress came to the table and apologized, saying that the Eisbein was sold out for the day and asked if we would like to order something else.  She assured us when we placed the order that they had some left, and she had reserved one for us, yet it took them 45 minutes to realize they couldn't even make one of our main dishes.  We placed an order for Paprika Schnizel instead.  By the time we finished the small side salads, we had been at the restaurant for almost an hour and our appetizer pretzel still hadn't even arrived.  We saw a waitress come out of the kitchen with a giant pretzel, relieved that we were finally receiving our appetizer, but the waitress put the pretzel down on the table next to us, who had arrived long after we had already placed our order.  When we asked the waitress why our pretzel still hadn't come out yet and the table of people who arrived after us already had theirs, she went back to \"ask the kitchen\" what had happened.  After several more minutes and no food in sight, we decided to leave and ate at our favorite Chinese Restaurant instead.  We were so pleased with our last visit that it is a shame the service was so horrendous.  I doubt we will ever be back.  There is no excuse for making us wait over an hour without even being served an appetizer.",

The atmosphere and the traditional german food have always been top notch, however the last 2 times the food has not been the best. I always order the same platter on family outing with schnitzel, potatoes, pork, sauerkraut, and the german sausage as well as, of course, a german tap beer. I really dislike taking stars away because the waitress, atmosphere including the accordion player, and the beer were perfect as always. However the time before, the pork in the platter tasted like it was sitting for a while and not very fresh. I didn't make a big deal out of it because it was only one time. The most recent visit however was the sausage that really tasted as if it was on the verge of becoming spoiled. I again didn't make a big deal out of it because of all the great memories I had the years before at this place. It's possible that these 2 times were just flukes. I just wanted to share my most recent experiences here in hopes that they will be more careful with the food in the future. However by no means will these incidences change my mind on Haus Murphy and I will absolutely be returning!",

They even have a traditional German band that will sit outside and play while you dine to round out the experience.      The beers are served in traditional German sizes, some bigger than your head!  As always German beer is well above average and you won't be disappointed with whatever one you get.  The food again is very traditional.  Try the pretzels that they have imported, it's bliss in a twisted, salted package.  We had the Guinness brats and the jager schnitzel.

    "text": "Wow. What has happened to this place? Talk about a downhill slide.  Went for dinner last week. Talked this place up to a family friend from out of town who is of German heritage. We were all excited to go. That faded quickly as soon as we walked up.  Usually there's a hostess to greet you next to the big pretzel. Been that way for years. This time, nobody, and it was far from being busy on a week night at 6pm. 2 tables occupied on the patio, and about a dozen tables inside. Walked around the entire restaurant like tards looking for someone to seat us. Finally found one of the regular waiters (of the 2 they had working that shift) to seat us.   Menus have changed drastically from my last visit. Used to have a normal menu book, now those have been replaced with a poorly executed, Waffle House style placemat menu. Very low brow and a pain in the ass when you're flipping back and forth to decide on something. Only the beer/wine list page remains from the old menus. Thinned out a lot of the choices, too.  Ambience has changed a lot in the bar area. The place always could have used a makeover, and they did one, but went the wrong direction. The big banquet-style picnic tables are gone and in their place are horrible cheap retirement home-spec dining tables and chairs. Poorly painted German flag colors, a big tv, and no more interesting shit on the walls. Looks to me like they're trying to turn the back into a sports bar, but it's poorly executed.  Beer. Usually a highlight. Didn't even order one this time. They typically rotate a random beer in from time to time. I was told by our less than attentive and less than friendly waiter that they never do that. I guess I imagined the oddball, grapefruitish beer that I had never had before which my girlfriend ordered last time. Prices went up, too. Years ago, a liter was $9, now its $13-14. Entrees are also more, as is the pretzel. Didn't order one of those, either.   I was pretty turned off by the service and atmosphere at this point, but I figured I'd let the food make up my mind.   It did. And I'll never be back. My brat was dried out and overcooked. My girlfriends dish (pan fried chicken with some kind of sauce) was bland and the chicken was VERY dry. The red cabbage was flavorless and appeared/tasted canned, a far cry from how it used to be. My dad's stuffed cabbage dish was also flavorless, and we deduced that his entire dish is basically what gets mixed into their house soup every day. The \"German Potato Salad\" has devolved into fried potatoes with some chunks of bacon and parsley thrown in. Pathetic, and definitely not what it used to be.  We left at 7, horribly disappointed. The patio, which is usually pretty busy starting this time of year, was completely deserted when we walked out.  Haus Murphy used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, but their apparent attempt to appeal to the masses, coupled with a steady decline in service and quality, has left me to look elsewhere to find good German food.",

They have a lovely warm kraut that they serve with the meal. For an appetizer, the Brie en Croute is divine served with a fabulous Lingenberry sauce. Try convincing your wait staff to give you extra Lingenberry sauce. If you are in to German sausages, they are delicious but a little on the pricey side. Of course, the beers are fantastic and robust. I love their Oktoberfest. Warning, this restaurant does not offer free bread. If you order the bread basket, while delicious, it is a small portion, so if you are a bread lover, you might have to order more than one basket and pay for it, too. Sometimes, they serve a beef broth soup that is to die for. Don't let looks deceive you. It doesn't look like much, but the flavors are robust and well-layered.",

I was raving about this place to my mom on the way to downtown Glendale because I have been here before...got seated pretty quickly, but our server (whose name I wouldn't even know because he never introduced himself) was less than friendly. When we ordered he let us know they may be out of one of our lunch choices, so he went to check and sure enough they didn't have it..so we ordered something else and he went back and put the order in. After about 10 minutes or so a lady(I'm assuming maybe the manager) came back to our table and let us know that they didn't have the other item we ordered either...are you kidding me?? I understand on the menu it says limited availability, but come on...how about your servers let your customers know ahead of time that certain menu items may not be ready yet, or better yet OUT!! The manager did offer another option but at that point we were upset and wanted to leave! We ended up taking our business over to the hop shop and it is amazing! Get your shit together haus murphys!!  Oh and from a former server and current restaurant manager, to whoever our awful server was...learn a thing or two about customer service, it goes a long way even if the food is out of stock!",

They have great sausages, decent German style food, not overly extravagant, though table service was excellent. Price was as I'd expect it to be. Wifey and I got the dinner for 2 for $35, I kicked back two Dunkel's and she had a delicious white wine. For desert we opted for the cake and coffees.   You can opt to sit at the bar, a table, or outside depending on weather and events going on (or lack thereof).   Clean bathrooms. Plentiful parking around the back sides of the building. It has a homey kind of atmosphere, you are among friends and relax, kudos there.  All in all a nice treat - I'd surely return and explore more of their menu and drinks! As for the authenticity of it being German, well that's like trying to describe American food, you will get something different depending on what region you are in -- it was German enough for me ;)",

I love German food and in Arizona you can count on one hand that you get it here in the valley. I used to go to this place in the early 2000's and it used to be a once a month treat for us poor Airman stationed at Luke. We sat at the bar and service was excellent. I ordered the Sauerbraten and my wife order the Jagerschnitzel. The schnitzel was nicely prepared and gravy was excellent. The Sauerbraten did not seem to have been marinated, or if it was it wasn't marinated for very long. It was very dry and overcooked but the gravy was spot on! The Spatzle was also good just a little under seasoned. Great beer on tap and great ambiance. I don't mind paying for food when it's great, I was just hoping that their featured menu item had a little more quality control.",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times and decided to go again last night.  I've always found it odd that there are so few German spots in the Phoenix area (much less good ones).  It would seem odd that Downtown Glendale of all places would lay claim to the best German spot in the Phoenix area, but having sampled many of the few others in town that exist, its hard to deny that Haus Murphy's has the goods.  Whether you're here for sausages and schnitzels, a good German beer, the feel of a nice outdoor biergarten, or the weekend polka music, you really can't go wrong here.  Just be warned that no matter what you order, the portions will be enormous.  And you'll be hard pressed to find any dishes that have vegetables.  And you'll be even harder pressed to find dishes that don't have meat and potatoes.  Fortunately I'm a meat and potatoes guy and highly recommend each and every one of their sausage dishes.    My only complaint in the times I've been here is that the service can be a little slow.  On Friday and Saturday nights when the place is packed and the polka band is playing that can be expected, but even when I've come on random lunch and early dinner hours when the place is slower, the service is still pretty slow.  So be sure to plan on spending some time here (I'm pretty sure that's their goal anyway).  As long as you're not in a big hurry and have a hearty appetite, you won't be disappointed.",

We had a party of 6 adults, 2 kids and an infant (that remained in his car seat the entire dinner). The place was busy but to our delight, were seated immediately in the back bar area. This is when things started to get rough. Our waitress arrived approximately 15-20 minutes after we were seated to see if she could start is out with some waters. When I asked about the beer menu, she seemed confused... But I thought maybe because that came further along in her checklists of things she was required to accomplish. Once I had the beer menu in have I began asking simple questions about the beer. Like...\"what are the different beers comparable to?\". This is when rough turned worse for our waitress. She explain that the first three beers were \"like Coors light\" and the last two beer so were \"dark beers\". The night only got worse. I'll give you some of the quotes... When asked what the sides (listed in German) were... The response was \"I have no idea\". When asked what type of meat was in the stuffed cabbage... Again \"I have no idea\" followed quickly by the statement \" I am so bad at this\"...I believe she was referring to her job as a waitress.  I actually felt incredibly bad for our waitress. She's just didn't care at all about that job making it painful for both her and the patrons. The food was good. Not great. The best thing we had all night was the spicy sausage cheesy bread appetiser. It was awesome.",

We had the stuffed cabbage and the apple desert (fritter?) Both were heavenly. The stuffed cabbage has a flavorful sauce that finishes it off perfectly. The sausage/beef stuffing was seasoned just right and complemented the entire dish. When we got to the dessert, I didn't think I would have any. My boyfriend ordered it and I said I would have a tiny taste. WOW! Fabulous! It's a big dessert, big enough for two people. And I had far more than a 'taste.' Exquisite. That's all. Exquisite.  Oh, and the beer menu is good. I had a red beer (I already forget what it was, but it was rich and full-bodied and was a good accompaniment to the food and the mood.  The ambiance in the restaurant is wonderful. It definitely feels like you have slipped into Germany. We sat outside in the courtyard. With the heaters it was very comfortable. The decor is greatl and sets the mood. The singer (Al) was great. He went from country to jazz to soft rock to pop with ease. He knew so many songs I was blown away. The Manager was very attentive doubling as our waiter. He knew his beers and the menu well, and he obviously loves his job.   I'll tell you how great this is... my BF is a chef and he went out of his way to go back into the kitchen to compliment the chef and kitchen team. I highly recommend this. If you are here in Phoenix for all the festivities, make sure and add this to your list of restaurants. You will thank me later! Bon Appetit!",

I think they were having Oktoberfest specials, but I do know that the piece of cake we ordered cost about the same as our sandwiches. Lol. Their menu was limited, and again, not sure if it was a special lunch/Oktoberfest thing.   Our server was friendly enough but was very busy and it seemed like a lifetime between submitting a request and it actually getting accomplished (you know, like getting a straw)   Great place in downtown Glendale.

This includes several kinds of sausage, a pork cutlet, a schnitzel, a kind of hamburger in gravy, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spatzle and fried potatoes.    It look great! Sadly, it all appeared to have been pre-cooked and then microwaved.    Let me repeat that -  a precooked and microwave schnitzel!  The spaetzle in particular was a soggy, water-logged travesty.  $35 for this by the way.  So with two beers and tip, that was $60.00 for lunch. For microwaved food.  It's quite sad that they don't really care about the quality of food here.  This type of Bavarian food is fairly easy to prepare so it's hard to understand why they would have so much contempt for the customers or the lovely cuisine of Germany.  Any restaurant that would serve you reheated food like this really doesn't care about you or about the food they are serving.  I wish I had noticed the 50 filtered reviews before eating here.",

We both got sausages and split them to share.  Happy with both.  And the potatoes and craut were pretty good too.  So then, why only 4 stars and not 5?

The pretzel fed four of us for an appetizer. The sauerkraut cake was so moist and loaded with fudge frosting!  We will be sure to come back and bring our friends!",

    "text": "Not much omm pa pa in this German restaurant. Ach du lieber.   My dad was career military and our family was stationed in Heidelberg, Germany for several years, while I was a teenager. I was fortunate for many things, among them the ability to enjoy a wide variety of tasty and authentic German foods. I miss the German comfort food from my youth.   That's why I was so excited to hear about Haus Murphy. Not only is it located nearby, in the Phoenix area, it has also been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives - so it must be good, right?   Well, actually, not so much. I ordered the Schweizer Schnitzel, pork loin with sliced ham and cheese. Sounds scrumptious, but was actually a bit dry and I'm not sure I could have detected the ham and cheese unless I knew it was (supposed to be) there. My husband had the Chicken Schnitzel with white wine mushroom sauce. Even though I'd never heard of chicken being made into a schnitzel, it was better than mine. Entrees include a side of German potatoes and also Wirsing (creamed cabbage) both good. In addition, we ordered a side of red cabbage (great) and also spatzle noodles (fair).   The live omp pah band had good intentions, but was so loud it disturbed the customers.  I heard one customer ask the waiter to please move the band away from their table because it was making for an unpleasant dining experience.  Overall, nothing horrible, nothing great, I won't be returning.",

When we arrived there was not too many people there and we sat on the bar side. Glad we did. There was an accordion player and a tuba player playing the typical German \"oompa\" type music. And they were in lederhosen It was awesome. By the time we left (7:00 7:15) it was starting to get busy. With all their menu choices it was hard for us to choose but we decided on the Giant Pretzel appetizer and a dinner sampler plate for two (sorry don't recall the name of it) that had schnitzel, 2 kinds of kraut, german meatloaf, potatoes, spaetzle, and a smoked pork chop. We loved it all. Both my wife and I have German ancestry and this is some of the foods we remember our grand parents making. The giant pretzel had a side of spicy brown mustard that I just loved. We couldn't finish these ginormous portions so unfortunately we couldn't try he desert. We did take it home and it was tasty the next day as well.",

If you go on the weekend you should definitely take advantage of the wonderful tuba and accordion music with a great draft beer.  Also, the food never disappoints. The Jager Schnitzel is a favorite, along with the ham shank (but you have to catch it on special). Don't miss the Giant Bavarian Pretzel and the stuffed mushrooms are some of the best we've ever had. The BIG Stuffed Cabbage Roll and Schweizer Schnitzel are also some fan favorite. Finally, don't forget to try the Sauerkraut Cake. It's wonderful, especially for chocolate lovers.   This place is definitely a family favorite and not to be missed on any trip to the Phoenix area. Prost!!",

With German beer and food and the setting it seems as if you might have actually stepped into some small German town - especially when you hear the band and the tuba going oompahpah. Onto the food... the mushroom appetizer is just crazy delicious. I also always get some kind of shnitzel. And I always have a few German beers when I'm here although I will occasionally stray and get schnapps or some liqueur. I've ALWAYS had a good time here. Of course, I always have several large glasses of beer as well so I could be biased. In my book it's \"wunderbar\"",

Both times I have gone we had the potato pancakes - these are a bite of greatness.  Also the schnitzel is wonderful, I recommend the Paprika schnitzel.  Dessert - bread pudding is delicious!!

But after being turned on to a little gem in Gibson City, IL called \"The Bayrn Stube\" my appreciation of fatty meat and spices stuffed in an intestine laid on a bed of sauerkraut and red cabbage has been forever changed. Haus just doesn't quite measure up. The cup of soup before the entree tasted like it came out of a can and the bread looked like the sheets of Hawaiian bread you buy at wally world. Probably the biggest turn off was when they brought out the brown mustard still in a plastic squeeze container.  My meal was the Nuernberger/Kassler combo for one, and I had enough left over for breakfast the next day. Their sausages seem to be of lesser quality than I would get at Sunflower and the red cabbage had some pork gristle in it. Not that I mind a little pork fat in my cabbage, but not chunks, and definitely not gristle. My friend ordered the Huehner (Chicken) Schnitzel, which had a very good flavor, it was the best part of either of our meals. They do have a nice selection of good beers on tap, no Aventinus though.  If the food was anything other than German, it would get 2 stars. It is nice to have somewhere to get a schnitzel when I'm in the area, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here.",

    "text": "I was soooo excited to hear about a German Restaurant in Arizona. After visiting Berlin and Franfurt for a week, I absolutely fell in love with German food.  While the service was great and prices were decent, the food was not as exciting as I thought it would be. For an appetizer, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. This was a great start to the meal because they were great. Possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Cream Sauce was amazing and the shredded sweet potato on top was a nice touch. That, along with my beer, were the best parts of the meal I would say. For dinner I chose the bratwurst with sour kraut and German potato salad, and my husband chose the paprika schnitzel with wersing and German fried potato's. Both of us had the soup of the day as well which was cream of mushroom. The soup was decent although it could have used a bit more salt. My meal was ok but comparing this to similar meals in Germany, I felt it was kinda boring and lacking. Also, the curry ketchup I ordered was not what I expected. Curry Ketchup in Germany is a lot like BBQ sauce in taste. The stuff I got at Haus Murphy's just didn't taste right to me. It tasted like ketchup with a curry aftertaste. Anyways, my husband did not like his paprika schnitzel at all. The flavor also seemed a bit odd. If you don't like curry, do not order this dish! The fried potato's were mediocre (kinda boring). The wursing, on the other hand, was very good. I think its because it had the same cream sauce as what was in the mushrooms. After dinner, we decided on bread pudding for dessert. This dessert definitely needed some work. There was not enough spice in it so it tasty like nothing more than bread soaked in eggs most of the time eating it. In any event, Haus Murphy's wasn't bad. I am rating it based on whether I would continue to go there and since I am in Maricopa and its in Glendale, the food would have to be spectacular to make me want to come back. Unfortunately, only a couple of small portions were close to being spectacular which I am not sure make it worth the time, effort, and money to return again.",

I've been coming to this restaurant since before it moved to its current location.  I lived in Germany for nearly 4 years, and the food was amazing.  I found Haus Murphy when I moved here and was overjoyed that the Schnitzel was very close to the \"real\" Schnitzel in Pruem, GE.  But, someone has gotten hold of the ingredients.  Perhaps the quality and pride in the food got lost somewhere in all the times the restaurant has changed hands.  They have either decided to cut back on good, quality ingredients, or just don't care anymore.  My last two visits left me wanting.  As another reviewer put it, the food used to be really good, but now it's \"meh.\"  The only good part of the meal was the mushroom demi glace.  THAT was really good, and covered up the blandness of the dish.  The portions have really been cut back, as well.  Tiny bit of potatoes.  No bread basket anymore, unless you pay for it (way too much money), and the dessert was bland and too gooey.  Strudel crust is supposed to be flaky and crisp!   Service was excellent., however.  We sat on the patio, and some moron allowed his two little daughters to run up and down the patio, screaming and dodging in and out of the tables and wait staff.  One waiter was terrorized by these brats, as he had to swerve several times to avoid colliding with them.  He was nearly tripped with full plates in his hands, but never changed his expression.  Just carried on.  (People, please teach your children how to behave in a restaurant!! )  I know we won't be going back.  Husband was NOT happy with the amount of the bill compared to the unremarkable food.   I'm sad.",

Professional, friendly and aiming to please.  The sauerkraut puffs were a disappointment.  Mostly mashed potatoes fried.  No sauerkraut flavor.  The cream of chicken Florentine was delicious; properly seasoned and full of spinach, sun dried tomatoes and chunks of chicken.  My Wiener schnitzel was wonderful in texture, but lacked seasoning.  Needed a little garlic salt maybe.  The creamed wising on the side was blah and just luke warm.  The German potatoes looked like they'd just been reheated (maybe several times!).  My husband's sauerbraten was just ok.  His purple sauerkraut was excellent, but the spaetzle were tasteless doughy worms.  Was excited to try the apple strudel which is made on site.  Unfortunately, it was not fresh.  The pastry was mushy and apples overdone.  I think if they tweaked thing a bit more it would be a better experience.",

    "text": "We absolutely love this place! Not for the health food crowd, but definitely for people who do not mind pounded, fried meat and giant beer. They rotate between 4-5 soups and each are delicious and come with every dinner or you can opt to get a German salad for about $2.00 more.  It is impossible to leave this place still feeling hungry.",

The service was pretty good and the staff knowledgeable about German beers and food.  Its good to try once and that's bout it just to say you did.",

The staff is helpful describing the menu and offering their favorite selections. The food comes out within a reasonable time. It is reasonable priced and so good. Seriously if you have not been here you are missing out and need to try it out. The sauerkraut is amazing defiantly not from the can defiantly home made (like everything on the menu)!",
