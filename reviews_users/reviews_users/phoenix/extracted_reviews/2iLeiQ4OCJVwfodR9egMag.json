I've done the lunch & bowl three times and each visit was easy breezy, just stick to the following:  Most people are there during their lunch hour so show up a little early to guarantee access to the next available lane. Sign up for your lane immediately upon arrival and order your meal as soon as your server checks in with you. Keep your game going and avoid stalling and lingering. Believe me, two players can get through a game and lunch within 45 minutes. Most importantly, just have fun!",

Shortly after this review, I got a nice note from their corporate headquarters apologizing for a not-so-good experience, and that's all I needed. I dig a company who acknowledges that there is always room to better serve their customers. I've been back to Lucky Strike many times (for lunch, for dinner, for a lazy Sunday) since then and there is definite improvement in phone manners and in handling customers' questions.  More importantly, Phoenix management went above and beyond for me on  a busy Friday night. I didn't expect an agreeable response, I simply thought there was no harm in asking, and management surprised me with an excellent solution.  And that excellent solution made a new mom/birthday girl very happy.  Fist bump to PHX management and staff.  Now if they can only do something about my game, I'd be set.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for this place a week in advance. left a voicemail and the host gave me a call back right away and reserved my party.That's a plus! We came a little bit late because we were driving in from California but we were only 15 mins late. however the host still allowed us to keep the reservations. Another plus!   The clerk , did a poor job in explaining the rules. When we walked in at 9:30 She told us that we could play as many games within the hour. when you purchase time. But they didn't make us finish our game nor did they make us finish our time. So I was upset. I asked to speak to a manager and he (Kevin Stone) took his own sweet time to come speak to us while he was talking on the phone. It was soo long that we had to walk up to him and stare at him for 5 more mins until he noticed that we were standing there.   However,   recently the Marketing Coordinator or lucky strikes contacted me on yelp and was really sorry about my incident. She agreed to give me 2 hours of play time back.    That  was great on their part. Lucky strikes has definately changed my mind about there customer service. The marketing rep has gone above and beyond and I really appreciated that establishment. So I changed my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.   Kudos to Lucky Strikes and looking forward to giving them another chance.!!",

    "text": "I went to Lucky Strike on Saturday Night.  This review is more about the feeling I got than any particular aspect or event there.  With one exception, my bartender was absolutely my favorite bartender of all time.  (If you are reading this you make the best iced tea ever!)    We get there about 7:30 and had to wait about half an hour for a lane.  No problem, it's Saturday at 7:30 on opening weekend.  I kind of expected a longer wait.  We all sit down at the bar, order some drinks, and grab a bite to eat.  I had a club sandwich (not so great), friends had a pizza (they seemed to like it), and the last of our foursome had the pretzels sticks (I stole one and loved it).  The drinks were good and seemed well mixed.  I generally just drink bourbon on the rocks, so it doesn't take a genius,  but the pour VERY generous.    When our TGI McManahan's beeper goes off we head on over to the front desk to claim our lane.  It wound up being about 20 per person for shoes and and the lane.  By the way.  Try not to go anywhere you need to rent shoes with a guy well over 6 feet...Size 14? really?  There were some issues with my friends changing over the bar tab but these things happen with an opening weekend.  The music had some high points but over all was a little disappointing.  The waitresses were attentive.  I bowled like crap.  That about sums up the facts.  Oh wait.  The place is done very well as far as decor.    I will definitely be back but I don't see myself making it a weekly trip.  Maybe every other month.",

Apparently, for one set price per child, they will be unlimited refills of drinks and food for the party~ which is perfect if you have teenagers who don't blink twice at having 10 hot dogs!   We had a table laddened with hot dogs, fries, pizza, popcorn, potato chips~ talk about a kid's food heaven!   We were situated at the last lane which was perfect, the kids could run around safely while the adults lounged around and have adult conversation.  They have a full menu and full bar to satisfy any adult's appetite.  I took a tour of the place and became very excited by the vibe of the place (sleek, modern, new, clean . . . ) that I wanted to bring all of my friends here to have a good time that I texted a group of my friends right then and there about having a night out!  The waitresses were great~ very friendly and told me that on Friday and Saturday nights the a DJ comes and spins cool tunes~ she says the place gets packed so make sure to make reservations for a lane. (They have pool tables too.)  What a great addition to downtown Phx . . . would not be surprised if Tarantino shoots a scene at this lounge . . . this place is that cool.",

When I asked to speak to a Manager they sent the Assistant Manager Rudy, who when I met him explained I was just here to bowl, I was not interested in going into Gypsy Bar. He said that it was \"an UPSCALE bowling alley\" and my attire was not acceptable. I could understand the dress code if I was some punk kid off the street. But I am 38 and I was with two friends who are also my age. When I explained to him that as a manager he should be able to make a managerial decision and let me slide. Being that I have worked in the industry for the last 20 years being a manager and a VIP host at some real UPSCALE venues...Cajun House of Blues, Cat Eye Lounge, and the GM of Jackrabbit Lounge in Scottsdale for 3 years, and am currently the Director of Operations at another Phoenix venue. He still declined. To say the least, he obviously has no concept of customer service, or how to make a decision that would probably be more beneficial to his business. We ended up going to Let it Roll Bowl. No dress code, no problems, and made the best of it. I will never go to this business again and per this review, suggest you don't either.",

I went with friends this past weekend and while I expected it to be busy, I had no idea it would be as packed as it was.   We went on the wait list at 7:30 for a lane and were told it should be an hour and a half, we were happy with that and went to get some food and drinks. Our waitress took 6 orders without writing anything down, when we said \"wow that is amazing you can remember all that\" she quickly told us how wonderful her memory is...we were all impressed....until we got our orders. Of the 6, 3 were messed up and when we nicely asked for things to be fixed she rolled her eyes and was very nasty.   I worked in food service for years and believe that even if you are annoyed, you should never let the customer know that and NEVER roll your eyes in front of them. So after we got all that squared away and were 2 hours into our wait for a lane, we were told it would be at least another hour to bowl....lesson learned. We will not be back to Lucky Strike. The atmosphere was really cool but the service was so poor that it is not worth making the trip there for mediocre food and service with an attitude.",

    "text": "When the announcement was made in early 2010 that Lucky Strike was coming to the neighborhood, I knew it would be special, and I knew it would be something that changed the game in Downtown Phoenix. Opening night at Lucky Strike went swimmingly, and it has been getting better and better ever since.   The atmosphere is reminiscent of Big Lebowski, which coincidentally was the model bowling alley for the first Lucky Strike. It's a small bowling alley with only 12 lanes, a lounge and bar area, and pool tables. Make no mistake, it isn't cramped, just a small place with a lot going on. By day you'll enjoy well lit lanes and a bright casual atmosphere, but by night, that all changes drastically. Lucky Strike is predominately a night club on the weekends, when the music is loud, the lights are low, and the sexy people are aplenty, sometimes three deep standing at the bar with a 2 hour wait for a lane. Some say the Old Town crowd has moved in, but I say it's a diverse and fun mix of people all with the same intention of dancing to old school hip hop, bowling, and having some fun downtown. The bowling lanes are a little nicer than your standard bowling alley. They have newer and better scoring machines, TVs behind the pins, and all state of the art technology. It's really fantastic.  Throughout dozens of visits, once as many as three times in a 24 hour period, I've recieved both exceptional service and awful service, with no real consistency either way. One visit, we sat down at the bar by the window in the back of the club, and were told we could not order drinks there. Another visit, I waited 15 minutes to get my tab after requesting it, though we were the only ones there. Other visits, the service was so perfect that we felt we could may as well be guests in someone's home. The staff here is all friendly, and everyone seems to like their job. I have a theory on the service, and that is the way the managerial staff has the place set up. It doesn't flow well for the servers. Example, there is a bar right by the bowling lanes which is never open. The other bar is around the corner, down the stairs, in another room. Servers must go here to refill a drink or get a beer, which makes it take forever. They should really work on a way to make food and drink service more expeditious.   By this point, I've tried every item on Lucky Strike's $5.50 lunch special (lunch, soda, shoes, and one game) menu and they have all been good. Some of the standouts for me are the Turkey Brie sandwich, a mixture of sliced turkey, melted brie, and apple butter on a Ciabatta, the Bleu Mini Burger, served in a duo (you can mix and match with other types as well) with house made french fries. You really can't go wrong with any of it, though. The happy hour menu features half priced \"Lounge Menu,\" $2 domestic drafts, and I forget what else from 4- and 9-close 7 nights a week. I love the pretzel dippers, served with garlic butter, mustard, and cheese dip, as well as the Beef Skewers with a spicy and sweet glaze. The same mini burgers are available at happy hour as well.   In actuality, if you're a hardcore bowler, you might not care about all the flash and bang at Lucky Strike. You might not care that there are beautiful women serving you food and drinks right at your lane while wearing little black mini skirts. You might not notice the DJ booth in the lounge area, and you surely might ignore the animations on the screen when you get a strike, but for those of us who can't seem to muster more than 125 a game, and really just want to hang out in a cool place with great food and friendly people, Lucky Strike is heaven.",

Hmmm, let's start at the beginning...reservations are recommended, you are assigned a concierge (unnecessary), you check in to get shoes and they imput your party's names so you don't have to fiddle around with that (nice touch. Wait did I just say fiddle, damn I'm getting old) however the check in boy seemed like he didn't enjoy his job.  A server brings you drinks...and she checks on you tons (cha-ching)! Atmosphere is great and  there is lounge vibe all around with fun music (they have a dj). Like that they showcase art from the local scene. And a first for me to see a bowling alley with  windows. The temperature (and the shoe guy) in this place knocked my rating down to a 3 star. It was a bit warm and we asked our \"concierge\" to fix that, she said they lowered it but we couldn't tell.   We were just there for funsies but it looked like a few celebrations were going on, so it seems like a good place for groups. The food looked good too, but we didn't partake.",

We made reservations for 7pm, arrived on time, and then waited about 20 minutes for our lanes to be available.  It was okay, because there was music playing, good drinks served at the bar, and pool tables open, but still...  We had an overall nice time, but I expected more out of a Lucky Strike, especially this early on in its presence downtown.  The music was run-of the-mill pop music and the service was average.  Most people are fine with just going to get their own food from the bar at a bowling alley, so if you're going to assign a server/waiter to each lane, then I'd think the service better be above-average.  One thing that was not average...the mini-burgers!  Mmm, they might've been my favorite part of the night.  Considering the fact that I live in Old Town Scottsdale and probably pass five bowling alleys along the way, and the fact that I had pay for parking (since Lucky Strike doesn't validate - crazy!!), I won't be rushing to go again soon, but I'll consider going again if enough of my friends are going too.",

No complaints from the staff while I was at the Yelp event.  I called Friday afternoon to reserve a lane for Saturday night and the woman I spoke to was very helpful.  Showed up 10 minutes early and we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our lane to free up.  Not a big deal, we spent some time at the arcade and the bar.  The bowling is always fun and the music was on point.  This is a great place for a date or with a group of friends.  I recommend you call a week early to reserve your lane.  Weekends can get pretty busy, but you'll have a great time while you're there.",

    "text": "My brother bragged non stop about how we had to make the drive from east mesa to downtown phoenix to hang out at this amazing place. Well, after meeting some friends for drinks at a downtown bar we made our way to Lucky Strike to play some pool and continue our drinking. As we walked in I was actually pretty surprised it was pretty damn cool. It was a adult playground, I felt like this is someplace my wife could drop me off for a playdate with buddies. We made our way to the pool hall desk and they told us it would be about a 30 min wait (this was around 930). We gave them our ID and phone number and headed to the \"club\" area to have drinks while we waited. For a Friday night it was pretty dead, but This bartender serving drinks was running around like he was super slammed when there was only like 10 people on his side of the bar and 3/4 of them had drinks. Even with that the other 1/4 of us he was ignoring. I later learned his priority was to get the waitresses taken care of before he even focused on us. After finally getting some drinks and settling in a booth in the corner we hung out. The music was good and the place was lively. After about a hour and a half we realized the pool people never called us like they said they would. We went back over there and they told us there was still a wait even though there was a couple open tables... I don't know the process but we threw in the towel on even trying to play pool. We went back to the music area and as I went up to get my tab from the bartender I again waited 15 min for him to serve the waitresses before even paying attention to us (not a very good multi-tasker). Earlier in the night I had accidently walked into the waitress station and the bartender had scolded my friend and I about  being in there. While we were waiting for our tab a girl and guy walked in there in front us a few of us and got their drinks directly from him. This was my last straw with this bartender and I made it known I was unhappy with his service and the fact he scolded us and then completely let a couple of people get drinks from the area we got chewed out. This was one of the first time in a long time I did not leave  a single dollar tip since after I expressed my frustrations he shrugged and literally danced off. IM not a cheap person, however I wont tip horrendous service when they even make it a point that they really didn't care about taking care of you. If your traveling far to hit this spot up its def worth checking it out for a couple hrs. There will be no next time for me. ill go to my local bar, the shiny lights and rude employees aren't worth that drive to me.",

After 30 minutes, our lane stopped working. They adjusted the time and fixed it for us. As the night went on, our lane stopped working two more times and we waited 30 minutes in between each maintenance check. Our party was supposed to end at 10. We were almost there until 11 with other plans lined up. We definitely did not get what we paid for as far as time goes. It was fine and we still had fun. I was fine with the birthday celebration and the service until we came back later that night to go to Gyspy bar. We actually had a lucky strike employee come up to us while we were celebrating  and asked us to come to the front, assuming we never paid for our lane. He questioned us and asked to see our receipt. We paid in advance and happily went to the front. We had to show the proof of payment on our phone. This was surprising considering we brought so much business to the lanes that night for my birthday and had paid ahead of time. Once it was confirmed we had paid, we didn't receive a sincere apology or explanation. Probably won't have a party here again which is a shame because I love lucky strike and love to bowl.",

The service is hit or miss. I feel like all their business comes from people that are unknown to the many places to go in the area.   Cool vibe if you're with a bunch of people and just want to dance at the next door Gypsy Bar. No cover and sometimes they have artists over there painting or awesome gogo dancers. Gypsy and lucky strike are pretty much the same place.   ANYWAY, if the prices were decent I'd probably feel better about coming here. Not my favorite place to hang out in downtown Phoenix though. You can do better you guys!",

They provide expensive bowling with cool tv screens, a dance floor, mini arcade and pool. My first time here was a few months ago when I was invited to a birthday party in the VIP area of the bowling alley. The service we received was horrible. My friend who had spent the money for her husband's birthday was very upset and mentioned a few times that it was a complete waste of her money. In fact, we didn't receive any kind of service - while our waitress was somewhere else, the guys ended up going to the bar and getting all their drinks that way.   I think this place has a cool concept and I wouldn't rule it out completely but I definitely think they should teach their employees the basics of customer service.",

It's the loveliest bowling alley I've ever seen - basically a plush lounge with lanes.  I've been here many times with different people and it's always fun.  Our most recent visit was on a weekday afternoon, and the prices are much lower (I can't remember exactly how much, and the website doesn't seem to have this info).  After several rounds of bowling, we paid $9/hour for the pool table, which isn't bad if you play fast - and it is pro-rated so you only py for the time you use.  This also seems to be a popular venue for large groups and special occasions.  We've even been to a birthday party where we just got drinks at the bar and didn't bowl.  So why not 5 stars?  It's pretty expensive for what is ultimately still bowling, and the service isn't great (they seem to attract a high percentage of  \"I'm doing you a huge favor by dealing with you at all\" staff).  My advice?  Go on a weekday and catch Happy Hour - on weekends, the prices are more than it's worth, in my opinion.",

Food was decent....we had a party package so we had wings, pretzels sticks and sliders. Wings were   good but I wasn't a fan of the sauces for any of the dishes. Burgers were over cooked and the cheese was cold and congealed.  Lastly, one of our parties lanes kept breaking and freezing. And then we ran out of time and couldn't finish our last game. I don't think that was necessarily fair, as much of the delay was their fault. Atmosphere is fun though, I'll give them that. I had a good time and I would go again and give it another chance.",

I love how they have a dress code (nothing fancy but no *AHEM* trashy allowed). If someone says bowling this is where I go! They also have pool tables and bar area. SO great for more than one party type.",

I didn't get to go bowling but the floor and lanes looked very clean. The bartenders working that Friday night near the back of pool tables was very attentive. Her service was flawless. Getting a drink had never been so easy. The only criticism I had was that the dance floor seemed small but then again that's not a primary focus of a bowling alley.",

Pretty reasonable compared to other bowling alleys. -also available at a per-hour rate as opposed to a per-game rate -price packaging for parties also available with reservation  Amenities: -12 lane alley (rather cramped) with electronic scorekeeping -2 pool tables -1 bar within the bowling alley itself -shares space with Gypsy nightclub/restaurant/bar  Food: -happy hour menu a \"must\" with $4 appetizers (quesadilla, buffalo chicken flatbread, fried veggies, among others), $3 well drinks and $2 domestic drafts -nosh available is \"upscale barfood\", with unusual/gourmet ingredients, sauces or twists.  -we tried the buffalo chicken flatbread, was very tasty; however, was quite greasy and had very little chicken atop it.  Bar: -as mentioned above, the happy hour menu is a must: $3 well drinks and $2 domestic drafts. -strong mixed drinks -slow service (one bartender for 12 lanes)  Staff: -great, friendly staff, wanting to make your experience memorable.

May not be appropriate for kids parties (or the pubescent male teenager).  Hours: -open til midnight Sunday-Thursday, til 2AM on Friday and Saturday.  Ambience: -reminds me of an upgraded \"The Big Lebowski\" alley -very hip and dark atmosphere with comfortable couches and lounge areas -slightly crowded when every lane is occupied-- be prepared to get to know your neighbors.

Anyway, Lucky Strike is a chain of bowling alley/ bars. This one, like others I have been to, is clean and has a 'fun' atmosphere. We came in the afternoon and got to bowl for an hour, which was great! We had some chips and salsa, which was tasty, and mac and cheese bites, which were not as good as they sound, but alright. You're not here to eat, right? They have a decent happy hour with discounted food and drinks. We had a couple beers which were fairly priced under 5$. I would definitely come back!",

Unfortunately, last time I came with a serious beast-like hunger and I had every intention  of shamelessly stuffing my face with lots of delicious bar food as soon as I sat down. I  ordered the nachos and the mini bacon cheese burgers. Lets just say both dishes were mundane and anticlimactic at best. The nachos left me extremely unsatisfied and wanting to run to Filberto's on my way home!  On a more positive note, the place looks very cool, modern trendy and pretty large.  It does seem good for parties and bigger groups. If bowling is your thing, I'd say this place is worth checking out but don't come for the food. just saying.",

I suggest going for the atomism here and not the drinks. I only gave it three star because of the dive atmosphere if it wasn't for that they would have gotten 1 star. It is a bowling place but only have 4-5 lanes and don't bowl on a weekend here it will cost you $50 hr. So you be the judge I guess.",

Food was done but drinks were not - we still had plenty of time on our bowling hour. Headed to the arcade section after bowling. Paid for their card to play games, and many of the games were broken. For example - swiped the card to play air hockey to find there was no puck. Played the basketball games and one ball would release. Played skee ball and no balls would come out when you pressed start. We alerted someone in the bar area of our issues and he just said - I don't know. It's too bad - I went here once before and had a fun experience with friends. This time was not great. Or even good. Just okay.",

The lanes have really cute graphics that change so you don't see that same thing over and over each time you make or don't make a strike. Every person who bowls gets a graphic popping up which is nice. The food is typical bar far and decent. Again nothing amazing but it fits the bill.   There are a ton of people there and you can play pool. It feels like a bar that is also a bowling alley. The girl at the front has an accent and it was somewhat hard to understand her. I would go here again and pay this time!",

The drinks and food were all super good, and the lanes were so classy.  The look of this place is out of this world.  Huge flat screens above the pins, super classy lighting and wood everywhere.

They were busy too, so a couple of us went over to try and 'win' a table from people who were there.  I normally enjoy playing pool, but didn't feel like it on this particular evening.  The pool tables seemed to be in good shape and there is adequate room, but with people walking by, it can get a bit annoying to deal with them interfering with the shot.....the traffic flow can be improved.  There's a bar area with a lounge on the side of the bowling alley and the floor of the alley is eye level, so it's kind of cool to watch the bowling action from that vantage point.  Overall, it's a pretty cool place.  Would like to come back again.  Return Factor - 90%",

We got there at 6:30pm and for an hour, it was $50 or $60...so expensive! Not bad if there are a number of you but there was only two of us and that time, you HAVE to purchase an hour. Okay, fine, not a big deal. We sit down and our lane didn't work as the hour is ticking down. You would think there is something that automatically notifies the employees that the lane has malfunctioned but I guess not. I notified the girl and they moved us to lane 11 which is second from the last lane. I know things happen, so that didn't really bother me. As we are bowling though, we were so hot and sweating! I was practically parked by the fan on the equipment that cools your hands. I started getting nauseous because I was so warm. When I mentioned this to our server (because I was concerned the AC was broken on that end of the floor), she agreed it was hot but that always happens when they raise the shades on the windows. She said the windows get so hot that even when the sun sets, it keeps that side really warm. I asked her to notify the manager because the heat had made us really uncomfortable. She said she would but we never got a visit or apology from the manager. Frustrating. If you know that is an issue then turn up the issue in that particular zone. I do not expect to pay that much for an hour of bowling to sweat my ass off the whole time. That is ridiculous.   On a positive note, the service was good and they had a great happy hour during the time we there. For two apps and a beer, our bill was approx $10. I felt like that really balanced out the price of bowling during happy hour.   Will I go back? Likely. But it is a shame that I'll have to picky about what lane we go to which might limit our ability to even get a lane. We'll see...",

    "text": "This is such an awesome concept with so much potential! I like the idea of a trendy, downtown bowling alley with a hip bar and snazzy feel. (I also love old school bowling alleys as well- especially the bars...top notch!)   Anyhow, Lucky Strike looks really cool. The main point being \"LOOKS\". When you actually touch something and focus, this place is made of complete crap. It just looks nice because it is new. The balls are cheap and generic. The floor, lanes and light fixtures are worse than Ikea. They have little plastic stools that probably cost a buck. Give this place a little wear and the poor quality will start to show. There also aren't a lot of lanes? The bar/restaurant area is bigger than the actual bowling alley portion. Hopefully the entrance is finally completed because we had to walk up some creepy closed in stairwell strewn with old food.   If you are going to charge over 20 bucks for two hours of bowling and attempt to be snazzy and upscale, then commit to that.   We went around happy hour time and they had some \"deals\" if you want to call them that. The glasses of wine were so very tiny. About a half a glass each. Our server was nice, but really slow. So we would order another drink as soon as she brought one so it would time out (about 15 min between). I don't really get it either since we were the only people bowling. Better hope you aren't a Vegetarian because your only option on the menu we had was soft pretzel sticks. At least they were really tasty and had nice presentation.   This place has good potential for sure. Come and enjoy. I just don't think the quality is worth the cost. .",

Our company had a Big Lebowski/bowling themed retreat day and about 20 of us hopped on the party bus and headed over to Lucky Strike for lunch and a bowling tournament. We had four lanes reserved for our party and at least two dedicated staff members taking drink orders and making sure everything went smoothly at our buffet style lunch spread. I'm sure I am forgetting some of the food items, but the boneless wings, salad, pizza, and club sandwiches went over really well. I personally LOVED the nacho bar too. The only thing that didn't wow me was the bbq chicken sliders, I think it was the bun that tasted off.   So a big huge thank you to the staff for being so friendly and attentive, and for putting up with some crazy and a few really loud drunk people on a Thursday afternoon :)",

As a bowling alley it's small in most dimensions. There are -- I believe-- 8 lanes. The approach area for each lane is adjacent to the ball-returns, which is a bit off-putting for those used to more ample spaces. And as bowling goes (at $4 per game) it's a bit expensive. The furniture is soft and comfy--in addition to being retro-chic modern--but with 8 people playing per lane there really isn't enough of it.   We were told by the staff that first of all, we would need to bowl in teams of 8 per lane. That's understandable, and didn't pose much of a difficulty among our group of 16. However, the payment for the games could only be split into a maximum of two transactions. That meant that we needed to pay two people with cash who then bought our bowling fun in a sort of straw sale.  Inconvenient, especially considering that 4 or 5 people suddenly needed to run to an ATM and probably pay a 3-dollar fee. Is there another way to handle it? Probably.  Then there are the laughable intellectual property regulations. We were told we couldn't take pictures of each other inside because everything inside is copyrighted. Well . . . y'know. . . . in this day of cell-phone cameras and fast CCD's that don't need flashes . . . well . . . I'VE GOT YOUR COPYRIGHT RIGHT HERE, PAL!!! Let me just say \"f*cking lawerly morons\" and leave it at that.   I ordered a martini that really wasn't too bad. Nothing to write home about. I think it came in at $9. It really wasn't worth that. I noticed others enjoying sliders and pretzels that looked good.  So what you get at Lucky Strike is a sanitized bowling experience with new equipment in a very nicely lit space. It's probably better as a date experience than for larger groups. And I think ironic urban hipsters have probably found their new home in downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "I've always had a great time at Lucky Strike - the food is good, the service is fantastic and the place is really cool and different.  It's nice to have an unscheduled, unticketed event/thing to do for the first time in downtown's history.    Crazy, funny, hilarious Nicole and Daveon are always helpful and on top of it - there's another server, with short curly hair and a cute pierced lip that's amazing too.  My only gripe is seeing a dress code - this is kind of weird to see in Phoenix, especially downtown, where people are hipsters and scenesters and just urban folks.  If people aren't dressed appropriately, they're going to feel uncomfortable, and I don't know about you, but I *want* to know who the problematic people are by how they look when they walk in.  Heck, even when I've been to the opera, symphony, theater, etc people are dressed in shorts and t-shirts sometimes.  What would make it better?  More things to do - I'd love to see a wall of pinball machines - pinball rocks.  Also, making Cityscape more interesting would help too - there needs to be more to do at Cityscape.... put in a Sega GameWorks.... get things to do that are unique and don't require special advance planning.  Be more urban, this isn't Kierland Commons.  Put in a giant building filled with apartments, downtown needs more residents or these businesses aren't going to last through summer of 2012, guaranteed.  Still, a 5 star experience...",

Not bad at all.  ****Wait-staff= Nice and full of energy. This was a highlight.  ***Decor= Upscale and nice. Slightly ironic with all the \"Obey\" posters in the middle of highly corporate establishment.  *Music= I like loud music, but this was deafening! I had to yell into my friend's ears so they could hear me. This caused more ear drum damage.  ***DJ=  It was digital-style DJing. Mostly pop-rap and some house classics synced to the videos w/ some live scratching.  I think they should call him a Music Video Projection Artist in addition to DJ. This is for the new school crowd and for me, not an every weekend mix-but it was highly entertaining. I enjoyed throwing my 15 Lbs bowling ball toward the high priced cars, gold plated teeth, and champagne bottles, in the rap videos at the end of the lanes--like a G6.   *Attitude of managers, host people, and most bowling staff= TERRIBLE! Please leave your ego in your domicle. There is no reason that you have to let me know how cool and important you are. I just want to bowl and have a drink.  Prententious and unhelpful! (not all of them, just 90% of them). If you desire return customers please act like you are happy that people are spending money at your business--not that we are a burden...\"No problem\" they say, after giving us the run-around, and about five different answers to the same question. (Note, my party was a party of professionals that were dressed up and we were NOT being 'cheap').  Conclusion, this place has great potential. It has a fantastic location and great wait-staff. Bowling is great fun anywhere, especially downtown, and in a building that does not smell like 20 years of cigarette smoke. The food and drinks are good and decently priced for downtown. The problems are easily identifiable in this review. The music could use some fine tuning and as they say \"attitude is everything.\"   Until the management, bowling, and host staff learn this, this dude will not abide...",

I almost felt weird bringing my kid with me to bowl, since the place felt so grown-up.  Luckily, we picked a kid-friendly time (Sunday morning), and the place was nearly empty.  We had fantastic service from everyone - the hostess, the guy who checked us in, and our waitress.  Our waitress was particularly awesome.  She didn't even bat an eye when our 4-year-old knocked over a glass of water.  I was happily surprised at how welcome they made us feel.  We sampled the Parmesan and Herb Fries, which were tasty, but I was wishing for more herbs and less cheese.  Maybe an interesting dipping sauce?  The menu looked interesting, especially compared to typical bowling alley food.  Looking forward to a return visit that includes a full meal!  The only downside is the price - $28 (not including food) for 3 of us to bowl one game, with shoe rental.  Maybe it is just my lack of recent bowling experience, but that seemed pretty high to me.  Luckily, the service and atmosphere made up the difference, and we won't hesitate to return.",

Never a dull moment and the crowd is a fun crowd no matter who's there. And such a great addition to the oddly slow building up of Downtown Phoenix's nightlife. About time!",

When you get to the pay counter the chart with the pay prices is hidden behind a bush, and the guy at the counter clicks a few buttons and charges you and asks for your card. He tried to charge us for the late hour game price, and I caught it after I found the sign. He didn't even know what to charge people. Then he springs it on us that the game price is per person, or we could pay the 40$ hourly rate. We begrudgingly pay and are whisked off to an alley. All in all one game of bowling came to 17$. 17$??? Dont go here. You can't even hear yourself think over the subwoofer and the screens above the pins are distracting.",

We couldn't even finish a game of bowling without our lane missing a pin to put down, counting our throw incorrectly, and twice in the hour our lane completely blacked out and we needed desk assistance to reset. For a hour of bowling Saturday night it was $60 plus shoe rental which was outrageously expensive for such crappy service and crappy lanes. The manager explained sometimes the lanes have issues and gave us a free hour of bowling to come back and play again. It was too frustrating to go back there even if it was free. The TVs were blaring and seating was uncomfortable too. Belgian fries were tasty so I give it two stars.",

The Mac n cheese bites we're delicious along with the margarita pizza. The food was brought out in a timely manner. Our server also kept our water topped off. The bad news is the lanes are dark. If your competitive don't plan on using the arrows. When we started bowling the overhead lights were on but half way through the first game they dimmed the lights. The lanes had glitches and would either give extra points, take away points, or not reset. The lane next to us bowled five times before it reset, even after hitting the reset button and the spare point weren't awarded. Due to the outside sign not being lit we had a hard time finding to location. We found it by looking at the Yelp pictures. We like the location being near Chase field.",

The lanes actually opened up a half hour early, so we were able to get started on our 2 hour bowling slot before we had a chance to challenge each other at Pacman. Two hours is the max amount of time you can play, which was perfect for our party of four, since we squeezed in three whole games with five minutes to spare in that time frame. It was hard to get a hold of our waitress while playing, so a couple times we went to the bar (conveniently located halfway between our lane and the bathroom) to grab a drink. The place is big and funky, and I can't speak for the food manu, but it did look like they had a nice variety of food. Definitely better than your average bowling alley!!!",

The manager (I want to say her name is Nicole) was funny and friendly. She made sure that we were taken care of. Because we were using two tickets, we got 2 hours of bowling for four, free shoe rental for four, and four appetizers!   We ordered the Short Rib Nachos, the Artichoke and Spinach dip, the chicken bites (chili sesame), and mac and cheese bites! Holy Moly - it was so much food for four people.

    "text": "I've bowled here twice and have really enjoyed the experience.  Lucky Strike has definitely take an old kind of grungy tradition and given it new life.  As many have mentioned, the environment is very much a lounge feel.  It's fun and feels much cooler than any other lanes I've visited.  I've seen others mention the on screen sports and I would definitely add my vote to playing music videos, or something akin to that, instead.  It's not a sports bar, right?  They do have a great selection of happy hour snacks and sips.  I don't generally try to go out exclusively in the evening, so if you don't mind going out earlier for happy hour, it's definitely worth it.  Lots of tasty snacks and cheap drinks.  The fried macaroni bites were quite good, as is the flat bread pizza.  Now, when we went, as it was early, I guess there were kids around, and they wouldn't post our \"creative\" bowling names (Sticky Rice Ballz, Fire Crotch, etc.).  So, for better or worse, it's a family conscious environment.  Service on the whole was pretty good, though it seemed our waitress was sometimes absentee, and they weren't very busy.  Overall, I'd go back with friends.",

    "text": "Made plans to head over to Lucky Strike after hearing about it (3) times in one week: my girlfriend went with her work, it was highlighted on \"Undercover Boss\" and again on E's Kendra... it was time. We went on Friday, about 8pm and it was packed... but we didn't mind. We checked in and they said it would be about 2 hours until we got a lane... no problem, we grabbed a drink (me, a Coppola cab - the fiance, a Kiltlifter). His beer was fine, but the cab was SKUNKY. I let the bartender know and he swiftly opened a new bottle sans tude... I liked that. We were waiting for (2) friends who arrived about 15 minutes later... about 10 minutes after that our buzzer alerted us the lane was open (so the (2) hour wait was really closer to 30 minutes. Not bad! The atmosphere is super clubby, almost in a bizarre way. They have bouncers at the door and you literally get turned away if you don't meet the dress standards (no hoodies, baggy clothes or hats). Kinda weird, but in a way I get what they are trying to do. The alley part is dark, with lounge style seating and super loud music. Very fun for bowling, but not ideal for convos. They have a little bar area with a DJ which is a bit quieter.  We had apps, but they have a full menu. The pretzel dippers and boneless chicken wings were very tasty.  Everyone had a great time, we'll definitely go again!",

The first time I went we naturally followed the big neon sign. There was an entrance no where to be found. After walking around CityScape we finally found the entrance on the second level. Once we got in it was super fun! The drinks and food were good and the prices are reasonable. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the top forty music blasting. If you have to be 21 to get in you shouldn't have to listen to Justin Bieber on repeat.",

    "text": "Planned a bowling night for 8 of my friends.  Called a couple days before to check to see if I needed to reserve a lane.  I was told reservations are only for groups who purchase a food & beverage package and that I should get there about 7:15/7:30 and put my name on the list for 8PM bowling time.  Arrived at 7:20 and was told no lanes would be available till 9:30/10.  Texted my friends to come around 9.  Ordered an ice tea at the bar (DD for the night) and was told there was a $10 minimum.  My bowling pager went off just after 8PM.  There was a cancellation and my lane was ready.  Unfortunately, only 2 of my friends were there.  We were informed that it's $50 per lane per hour and you have to decide right then how many hours you want to bowl and you must prepay.  They can only split the bill 2 ways (so make sure you/r friends bring cash).  The three of us ended up bowling for 1 hour and with shoe rental, it ended up $68.  Needless to say my other friends didn't make it in time to join us and they didn't end up getting a lane until after 10.  Bottom line, Lucky Strike is pretty cool, but definitely overpriced and chaotic if your group isn't all there and ready to wait for your lane.  It could be really fun if your group is willing to dole out the dough and get a food & bev package so you can actually make a reservation and bowl when you want to.  It seems a bit out of place, being Downtown.  Lucky Strike would rock in Old Town.  I will not be back, on my own dime at least.",

It should be in Scottsdale, since it seems they are trying to attract the pretentious Scottsdale crowd with the dresscode and prices. I'm not going to lie, I did have fun, but boy, was it expensive.  I do not recommend going on a Friday or Saturday night, since it is too crowded and they up the prices of the bowling on those nights. The service was pretty bad. The female bartenders and servers are all bitches. The food was good, the drinks, not so much.  And if you have to use the restroom while there, I recommend holding it unless you want to be grossed out.  If you're looking for a pretentious bowling lounge where you can waste your money, this is it. Between paying the gas to get downtown, drinks, food, bowling, and shoes, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.",

I was there for lunch, and our server was great and telling us she was about to relocate. We wished her luck and told her that she would be hard to replace. Then out of no where this guy was behind the bar(i'm guessing a manager), said \"no she's not hard to replace\". Are you kidding me!!!!!! This is how management treats their staff? After I ate, I asked the server if I could see the manager. She told me she would be right back to go look for him. About 10 min later, she came back and told me the manager didn't have time to speak with me. This is absolutely crazy!!!!!! I definitely won't be back, and will tell my friends not to go there, even though the service and food is good. There are plenty of places  in downtown to support where the management treats their staff properly.",

    "text": "Decided to take my newest man toy to Lucky Strike Lanes last night.  I know, I know...it is WAY out of the \"orb\", but sometimes you have to branch out.  It was a cool place, lot's of huge tv's, good music, pool tables and oh yeah, a full bar (bonus!)  My date and I arrived and it was happy hour (4 - 7pm and then again from 9 - 12am) so we decided to have a few beer to loosen up and get some food.   Domestic drafts on happy hour were only $2 and certain small plates are half off.  We had the hot pretzel rods that come with cheese, spicy mustard and garlic butter - they were yumo.  We had the hot spinach dip with tri-colored tortilla chips (not on happy hour but very good!) and a couple of the sliders.  The menu reads well and they have quite a bit to offer.  You could have dinner there, or just get some nibbles.  There were lots of appetizers to choose from and next time I will definitely try the fried macaroni and cheese bites (can it get any better than that!) and they had pizzas, salads, burgers, entrees, dessert.  After a beer, we decided oh yeah, we are here to bowl.  that was kind of a down side...it was $14 a game to bowl....kind of ouch, it's bowling!  I like that you get to sit in couches instead of hard plastic chairs, and the music and lighting is good, the shoes are new.....unlike the bright light of regular bowling alleys.  But, it is kind of hard to see the lanes??  Hence why on my second bowl, I actually struck the hard plastic thing that protects the pins because it hadn't lifted yet!  It was hillarious....and in my defense, it is dark!  Oh well, something to laugh about.  DO NOT park in the underground parking lot or the lot across the street, it is $12!  This isn't downtown San Fran for sake.  If you want upscale bowling...for sure head there!",

A young Russian girl with short blond hair who didn't smile, didn't make eye contact, and didn't want to take our order. I guess it was the end of her shift because before we could complain, Nicole came on shift. She was the best thing about our whole experience. She was prompt and friendly. The manager, Buddy, did come over to apologize about our reservation, apparently the girl who took our request made it for the wrong day...he stated this was not the first time this had happened. BTW we received nothing complimentary for our inconvenience and their lack of customer service. Don't waste your money...go to a real bowling alley. Also, the bathrooms were sad.",

But after my experience there lats night I don't think I'll be returning any time soon. I went for a small group birthday party, and upon walking in I thought the place was fantastic. Once we were seated and in our lane the waitress came over and took our drink orders fairly quickly. It took almost half an hour for her to return with our drinks and food. The food was already cold by the time it had gotten to us and our drinks were pretty watery. Our lane had some kind of problem, which took them ten-fifteen minutes to fix (which in my opinion when you are paying by the hour those 15 minutes really add up). While we were waiting for them to come over and fix it and waited for our server to come over and refill drinks, we watched the staff bowl, dance and play pool. I'm in the service industry as well, and when you are paying top notch for bowling I expect great costumer service. I understand that Lucky Strike is new and that there are still a few kinks to work out, I just expected so much more for the price I paid and for the experience I had. I think they should reevaluate their managerial skills and take a class in costumer service. I will not be returning.",

It was my friends 32nd birthday and because her id and another friends' id was issued in the early 2000's it didn't have some sort of Arizona state outline on it when a light is shined through it. Because of that we weren't allowed in because it could've been a fake. Really?!?! They're in her thirties, it was ridiculous! And we were there the weekend before and got in just fine! There were police officers by the door we talked to about the id's, they said they looked real and were just old but it was up to the doorman if we could get in. The jerk still wouldn't let us in so I asked to talk to a manager. While he was getting the manager we saw another doorman not flash his light on id's and let some little girls in. When the manager came out he looked more like the new bartender, he offered us free drinks when we get new id's and come back. Like we'd ever come back to place that wouldn't let us in, it would be one thing if we looked 12 but we're all pushing 30! It was really a shame, not only did they lose our business but also the 20+ party we had meeting us there. The other bars and restaurants appreciated our  $1000 tab.

I had read on their website that they do Happy Hour everyday of the week from 4-7 with drink specials and some 1/2 priced menu items. The decor is amazing and we love how you can watch the lanes while hanging out in the bar. We sat down and as soon as the waitress saw us, I picked up the menu and asked \"Is this the happy hour menu?\" And she said \"Yes, it is all 1/2 priced\" Perfect. My husband and I both got a well mixed drink. It was fine. However, our bartender/waitress was throwing off a weird vibe (I don't know how to explain it, but she made us feel uncomfortable and barely said a word to us) so we decided to just have the one drink and leave. We paid and after exiting, we saw the sign that had their happy hour specials listed which said $3 well drinks. We both got well drinks but were charged $5 for each drink. I understand that we sat down about 8 minutes before 4pm that day but after remembering that the first thing I asked the bartender was about their happy hour specials, you would assume you would get happy hour prices or she would tell you that she would have to wait until after 4pm to honor the prices if their pos system worked that way. I know it is only $4 but I think it is just common courtesy to say something.",

It was suprisingly slow when we first arrived but got busier as our evening went on. Staff was polite and attentive. Our waitress Christina checked in on us often and even had the music changed when we asked for something other than dance/techno. Food was better than expected however the pizza was really greasy. A great place to have a party with family or friends. I reccomend it!",

    "text": "First time at Lucky Strike. First, the ambience is super and it's very clean.  We were there for happy hour, great food and not very expensive at all.  Free refills on soft drinks which was a huge bonus.  Now for the downside of our visit.  We waited, and waited for a waitress to take our orders, she kept coming around the telling us she'd be right back.  This happened several times.   It wasn't busy at all, so not sure why the inadequate service.  When we did get to order, the food took forever!  For appetizers it sure took a long time, it was incredibly slow.  Refills on drinks took just as long, not sure I understand that part.  One of my friends had a common drink from the bar and it was so watered down and horrible, she should have returned it but didn't.    So  it's time to leave, the waitress brings our bills... finally.  Then we had to wait for her to come pick them up, and then bring the change back.  Three of us went to the restroom before she even brought our change and keep in mind two of us are women and take forever in the restroom.    Very slow service, not sure if she was having a bad night or maybe the kitchen and bar were holding her back.  At any rate the service wasn't great.  However, it is a neat little place and I say little because it's not huge, but I prefer that.  The music is a tad loud at times but it added to the atmosphere.   Definitely will go back again, just hoping for better service. The staff was reasonably nice, but walked around with zero smiles on their face.  Postive attitude is a must to work in that type of environment, people come out to have fun, not to have to deal with employees who are clearly not having a good time.   I'd love to work there, it's upbeat and would be engaged in giving customers the best experience.",

    "text": "I really like this place. There aren't that many lanes, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, call ahead and reserve your lane.  This place has a lounge area with a good sized bar and couch area. Over where the 10 lanes are, there are about 4 pool tables, another bar, and another table and couches area. The end of the lanes have screens above them to watch sports or music videos. They play good music very loud. I had a really great time.  My only complaint, we reserved lanes for 4 hours, and when the 4 hours was up, they wanted us out immediately. They started bussing the tables just taking drinks away. I was busy changing my shoes and didn't notice the busboy grabbed my drink. Excuse me, I just purchased that. I let him know that I understood they wanted us gone, but should ask the person sitting there which drink is theirs before throwing it away. As we were leaving, I was at the other table in our area and the busboy asks me if any of the drinks on that table were mine. I reminded him that he threw mine away and he should probably be asking that question to somebody else. It really annoyed me.  I would definitely recommend it for a Sunday fun day. I didn't feel like we could really relax and have a good time on a Saturday because it was too busy and the staff was looking to make money rather than have their guests entertained.",

What really got to me though was the lanes were not properly waxed so you couldn't slide and it would seem the AC was broken. My friends and I kept going outside to cool down. Several of us asked for the AC to be turned down and we were told the AC was broken, which is horrible is Phoenix. Overall I'd go to party there, but as a bowling alley, I'd go somewhere else.",

The place is decorated great and has a really cool vibe. Even if you are not bowling, it is a fun place. Also, the manager/owner used to be my sister's soccer coach and he is awesome.

For being a fancy bowling area you're not being well taken care of. The server looked like she didn't want to be there, she asked us what we wanted in a rude way, and looked at us as if we weren't good customers meaning she judges us right away. The margarita pizza literally taste like a microve pizza with just bread and red sauce and it was extremely cold. When I asked to put food in she gave me attitude like if it bothered her we were making our tab high. Then after we ordered more drinks and again it was a bother we ordered more drinks. Took 20 minutes to get our microwaved pizza and then after that we asked for pepper flakes and she told us and I quote \" I mean I think we have them but I can \"try\" and check to see if we do (instead of actually checking ) watched the whole time and didn't he even attempt too. I looked at the curtain behind us and she was on her phone doing nothing. Asked the food runner and brought it out within seconds. Then when we asked for the check she gave me atttiude and made an excuse she couldn't hear me because of loud music but it wasn't loud. When we got the check she was breathing down my shoulder waiting for it like if she thought we were gonna walk out on her. Then wrote a little note to her, and tried confronting him us but we told her why we felt her service was shitty and still couldn't understand. NEVER AGAIN WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE and after we ate it we threw up right away",

We went to a Suns game Saturday evening and were looking to go out and have some drinks after the game. Lucky Strike was the second spot on our night out. They have bowling of course, but there's more than you would expect. They also have an arcade area with 10 or so games including Pac-Man, a driving game, basketball, and more.   What was really unexpected is that a portion of Lucky Strike is also a club! There's lounge seating, a good-sized dance floor, and a DJ. A long bar is close to the dance floor so you can fill up with ease. Service was a little slow when it got packed but not too bad. By the time midnight rolled around, there was a lot of people on the dance floor so it was a pretty hype atmosphere.",

Got two games, set up is nice low lighting, neon glow, comfy lounge benches. We order BlackBerry mules 13$/each, 4 stars for the drinks. The game shut down halfway through the second game, I hit the help button like 10 times. After 5 min of no one noticing,  my partner told the front desk and it was fixed 7 min later. We wanted to play in the arcade however there was some shady nonsense about how we couldn't buy a game card to play for an hour unlimited unless we paid cash and the manager needed to be involved to make the sale. We tried to clarify why a credit card couldn't be used to get two unlimited games cards (40$) and they said it's because the register didnt have the option to ring it up. We got frustrated so we left. Customer service was garbage.  There was caliente night going on in the back with a bunch of people dancing to a live salsa band which was cool. Not crowded but to be fair it's a random Tuesday night in October. We will not be returning no matter how much I love skiball.",

Our waitress tossed menus on the table & walked away. We waited 20 min. for her to get back before walking to the bar. The bartender told me it would be a while because there were 18 people ahead of me. He was clearly frazzled & busy. The waitress saw us at the bar & ran over to tell us she would take our order. She delivered our drinks & disappeared again. An hour later, we finally saw her again delivering menus to another lane, but we had to chase her down to order again.

My s/o and I are fairly regular bowlers, with our own gear and such, so in terms of how a bowling alley operates we have a good idea of what's good and what isn't. While most bowling alley's tend to be on the older, dingier side, this bowling alley is quite impressive with an almost nightclub-level atmosphere. They have pool tables, a nice bar, good seating, sound, and plenty of tv's, great lights for cosmic bowling, and a large back area where they were hosting a sort of lip sync battle type event when we arrived. However, from a bowling perspective, this alley sucks. The lanes have no oil and chewed our balls up - they were covered in tough-to-remove glue-like residue, probably from the ball return. It was impossible to bowl well without oiled lanes, but the worst part were the technical difficulties that plagued our entire experience. The lanes have tv monitors and kiosks to enter information, yet apparently the kiosks to enter the info are just for show because we couldn't enter our names or make any adjustments when there were issues. We had to call someone over or go to the desk each time there was an issue, which kept happening the entire night. There were issues with the pins falling down after being reset, scores being wrong, people having to roll three times in one frame and the first roll not counting, and at one point the lane got completely stuck and we just got moved to an entirely new lane. Even if you were totally bowling for fun and didn't care about the lanes not being oiled, you couldn't even get an accurate sense of how you were doing with all the scoring inconsistencies and problems with the reset of the pins. Ultimately this was a frustrating experience for those of us who were regular bowlers and those of us who weren't. I would not return to bowl here again.",

    "text": "We had a large company event.  14 people for a corporate part.  We purchased a 2-hour event with food and alcohol for everyone.  This is a three-star review for the venue rules, NOT for the service.  The service team was on it.  This would be a five star review if the company didn't have a policy of 8 people per lane, especially considering they only have room on the lane for 4 people to sit.  14 of us could not fit in the space provided so we had people spread out everywhere trying to find a place to sit, while most of them ended up standing for the two hours.   If you're a couple going bowling this would be a great place, if you're a group going bowling, you'd be better off going somewhere else.  Our group hardly bowled because of the poor layout.  That many people paying for bowling, food and alcohol should not have to squeeze on two lanes.  20 minutes would pass between turns for each of us, which means with only two hours to play we only completed two games.",

    "text": "I planned a corporate outing at Lucky Strike during my company's annual sales conference. Our group had about 20 people and a fairly strict budget to follow. I initially sent an inquiry the week before via the group sales form on the website. Within about 1 business day I received a follow up from their sales manager, Justine to begin the planning process.   Justine made it easy for me to get our event planned! We traded a lot of emails about the details and it went off without a hitch. The easiest part was adding a few last-second additions, and she quickly sent over a revised contract/link for payment. We went with unlimited bowling for 2 hours + a few heavy appetizers (~$35/person).   Our group had a few allergies to accommodate, Justine & her team even went as far as asking if our seafood allergy could eat the buffalo wings fried in the same oil as something seafood. I checked & it wasn't a worry, but they went ahead and cleaned the fryer and made food special for that and others in addition to what we ordered. I know everyone appreciated that.   It was a little chaotic since my coworkers staggered in arrivals for about 15 minutes. Our waitress though tried to help me out (organized chaos with al the info), but once the games got started it was all good. Drinks were re/filled consistently, people were able to move about easily to bowl and chat- they gave us the VIP section with the uber comfy couches. The longer the event wore on, the warmer it got inside- not sure if Lucky Strike has actual air conditioning or a swamp cooler. Nonetheless it was uncomfortably warm and kind of a sour note to end on since most of our group was sweaty-ish by the end.  Despite that minor fallback, my coworkers had a wonderful time, I kept receiving compliments for a week after for the event, and my mad bowling skills. Thank you Justine & team for a great time!",

Somewhat steep, but I figured we were paying for an experience a little bit better than your average bowling night. We checked in early at 815, and were then told to wait 10 minutes before we could get our shoe rentals. Finally got our shoe rentals and were told by the guy who checked us in that our lane was ready. We sit down at our lane/table to find it completely unbussed with dirty dishes from the party before. This isn't usually a huge issue except we were never greeted by a server and I had to track down the check in guy to let him know no one had bussed the table, let alone took a drink order for the first 15 minutes of our reservation. This was the common theme of the night, CONSTANTLY getting up to track down a server to get anything done. The service overall was terrible. Finally got our food, it was okay standard bar food. Drinks were average and overpriced. The bowling was really fun but not really worth how much you pay for the overall experience.",

As soon as I got there I knew it was going to be a good time, it is really well kept, blasting AC, loud (but not too loud music), and huge T.V.s. The bowling lanes were very nice with big couches to sit on and large table areas. Our server was great and didn't make a big deal about splitting our checks. He was very knowledgable about the menu and quick. We went during happy hour so we got a bunch of appetizers to share including the mac and cheese bites (everyone's favorite), fries, and two flatbread pizzas (also very yummy). The appetizers were around $4 each, beer $3 and cocktails $4, we paid $4 for shoes and $4 per person for each game. It was pretty cheap for something to do to get out of the house for a few hours, especially in this heat. Overall I loved it and will be returning for some bowling and mac n cheese bites very soon.",

They were also really accomodating with us bringing our own birthday cake- providing us with plates & silverware.   The bowling itself was great fun, but getting to that point was a real hassle. Trying to reserve 2 lanes the Saturday before Christmas was difficult (even though I started trying like 3 weeks ago), but they managed to accomodate us for an hour before their contracted parties came in- but this took persistence with a few phone calls and schedule juggling with my party time.   The most annoying part was trying to get started bowling once we got there. They wouldn't let us pay until right when we were to get started. I was told beforehand to come in 15 minutes before our reserved time to get set-up with the names & shoes but what actually happened was once I paid, our hour started (although I did have time to try and guess all of the people that would show so they could enter the lineup). We had to rush to get our shoes, the names were already ready entered on the lineup and we had to shuffle to get things rolling. It was a bit chaotic.  If reserving lanes in advance here, I would definitely recommend that you know exactly how many are showing up & make sure they are all there on time. There really isn't any flexibility for latecomers or unexpected guests.  Also, finding it was a little difficult- we had to cut through the CVS and then go upstairs. And they say they validate parking, but keep in mind, it's only for an hour.  We ended up staying after our bowling finished, and found the lounge to be really comfortable. It was happy hour and the prices were great for the food they served. The food was really good- we had the macaroni & cheese bites (bite sized triangles, not too greasy), pretzel sticks (soft & fresh with 3 dipping sauces) & sliders (really flavorful).  Overall, I liked the place and  would love to come back-- but without the pressure of trying to throw a party.",

    "text": "last night 5/20 i went to my friend's birthday bash held at Lucky Strikes. Upon walking into Lucky Strikes it struck me that it didn't feel like a bowling alley but rather a huge roomy club. The music was happening, there was a dj by the side bar/lounge and as you walked up the stairs/ramp it led you to a cavernous room where the bowling lanes were situated as well another bar/lounge area and two billiard tables. The overall atmosphere and decor of this place makes it a go-to destination and something central Phoenix really needed. Anywho, my friend reserved two lanes for 120 minutes, each lane was $49.99/hr and she included us in a drink package of unlimited beer and wine for $22 excl tax. let's say the unlimited drinkage helped my bowling game or lack thereof. I've never felt that pro-ish, the tipsiness really gave me courage to give it my all! liked the dj, it was a healthy mix of dance ripped top 40 with old school hip hop... it really lent a True party experience to my friend's birthday bash as well as the overall vibe of the place. BUT one thing that annoyed me with lucky strikes was the music volume, it was LOUD! now, don't get me wrong I go out to the clubs in old town and I'm used to LOUD but a club with friends is not a conversation/social experience, albeit social but i go out to the clubs to drink and get my dance on. But at a bowling alley during down times like waiting for your turn, drinking your beer, there are times you might like to chat with your friends but with the music volume, it's too loud that you spend the time nodding your head and agreeing to something you did not hear =( and it ends up being a shouting fest like, \"What?!? you said what?!? huh? No... i did not buy this shirt from..., OH you said you like my shirt?! ok!! thank you! (other person - what?!?) give up, thumbs up!\"   Oh, food wise well it's upgraded bowling alley food with presentation if there's such a thing. lol. we ordered a basket of Parmesan herb fries $7.5 which was a large basket and the mac & cheese bites $6 which were quite bland but cheesy and was a good serving size. Overall, I liked the place, it's a great place for a birthday and everything is professional and appealing. Oh and don't forget to get your parking validated before you leave, it HELPS!",

    "text": "We had an office party here Friday for our one-year anniversary.  So, being that I didn't have to pay for the games, shoes, or food, my review is based on my experience.  Just thought I'd get that out there so nobody reams me.   We got the private room, which was really nice.  In fact, everything here was really nice: the decor, the people and, being that it's a new bowling alley, the shoes.  The shoes were still brand-new.  That's huge. We had a TON of food!  Pot stickers, pizza, veggie trays.  Everything was great and tasted fresh.  It wasn't Sysco food. The service was outstanding!  I'm not one of those people who says \"outstanding\" very often, but we were really taken care of well. There's a nice lounge off the main room for people who just want to...go to the bowling alley to drink.  Do people really do that???   I can't wait to get a group together to go again.  It's fun, it's Downtown and I'm excited about CityScape!",

That said, I know when I roll a strike ball, and when I stick 5-8 balls in the slot and end up with hidden splits several times, you realize the name 'Lucky Strike' is appropriate for this joint.  You are lucky if you get one. In fact, the best bowlers in our group, a young lady, she ended up beating every one because she bowls regularly, and was most consistent with recovering her spares. As consistent as she was, she didn't get one strike.  The few people who got strikes were experienced bowlers who got a few power rolls through. I've never seen lanes ridge like this. If you didn't hold an insane pace, or launch the ball 5-10 ft in the air, before landing it, your ball started an unreasonable break well before getting to the reaching the 1-2 or 1-3 pins. I actually rolled gutter balls with no spin, starting just right of center, because I applied slightly more power trying to get pace; several of my colleagues experienced the same results.  I suggest getting your own equipment if you go here,  as I ended up with a slight knee strain since my left shoe repeatedly got stuck as I planted, further making the possibility of mistakes more likely.",

Since I haven't bowled in 40 years, maybe they are a relic of the past or it was too dark to see them, or I don't really know how to bowl.   The three of us were well taken care of as we were using a 120 minute social party for eight that my son-in-law had bought at an auction. The party also included chips and salsa and mac n cheese bites. Chips and salsa were ok, but the fried mac n cheese bites were not (if you like mac n cheese and fried food, then you'll like these). Just not for me.   Bowling is actually a fun activity (as long as you don't have two gutter balls after a strike). I'd definitely come here again (minus the food). They validate two hours of parking, and there is a Yelp check in for renting bowling shoes!",

You can't really go wrong with bowling.  I rated this a 3 Star because of our first visit. There were 8 of us and they advised we should use one lane or we would need to pay an extra $50 for the second lane regardless of how many players. This was not including the shoes, just the lanes.  It took forever to actually finish a game and we had to pay for another hour. The gentleman was kind enough to extend our time. The only bad part was that it wasn't busy at all so they could have given us some leeway in using another lane.  The work out which was the second trip was much more catered to. They let us have 5 players per lane and we had a package paid for with food and the pool table.  Not sure if the treatment was different when we came without reservations and when we had reservations. I don't think the treatment shouldn't have been any different but it was.  This place isn't bad though. Really pricy in terms of renting the lanes. The food was always pricey and nothing spectacular.  For a work event though I would recommend this place.",

The place is a bit dark for my liking, but it made the screen easy to read. The ally approach is short withering the rear dots on the edge of the lane. In other words, you have to stand off the lane for your approach if you choose to use those dots as your guide. The balls were kind of clean, but the couches are old and torn. It was $17 for 1 game and 2 pair of shoes. It was just under $9 for each additional game. If you check in on Yelp, you can get free shoe rentals. Unfortunately I saw this after we paid. The bathroom is clean, but you have to walk through the Gypsy bar to get to it. Unfortunately it smells like vomit in between bowling and bathroom. I had food poisoning the night before so it was extra difficult to smell. I would give this place a 2.5 if I could because it's a great location and customer service.",

    "text": "Downtown Phoenix is slowly maturing and that's a good thing.  The addition of activity based businesses like Lucky Strike will definitely increase the allure of driving downtown for something other than a Suns or Dback game (or the occasional concert)  We were fortunate enough to have a team building event at Lucky Strike to wrap up another great year of being Sprouties.  We spent the morning volunteering and working up an appetite at the UMOM center and then drove a couple of quick minutes to the center of town for some great food and awesome lanes in a super cool environment.  Clearly, Lucky Strike is primarily designed for team building events like ours, (we weren't the only team there).  It's relatively large, full bar menu, and we opted for appetizers (pizza, chicken satay, poppers, chips/salsa, bacon wrapped shrimp, etc.).  We're a pretty large group, about 50 of us and they had no trouble keeping the food coming, plenty to go around.  I'd give the food 3.5 stars, certainly edible with no grumbling from the team.  This isn't Peter Piper or Chuck E. Cheese type of microwaveable junk food, its actually very good and they have a working kitchen.    And a full bar.  Did I mention the full bar?  I'm not much of a day drinker but its always comforting to know the option is there (I'm not a big fan of beer or wine so the option for a G&T or old-fashioned makes me happy-although good ice tea garners much the same respect.)  I hope we come back here next year, easy parking, cool shops in the area, and a metro Phoenix downtown that is starting to finally take shape.",

The seating for the lanes are couches that look like they have been used for 20 years and never taken care of. All of the bowling balls where chipped up and in rough shape. The lane are not kept up with. I do wonder how often they service them. They had no grip on the back end so bowling straight was not happening. Not to mention the lane next to us the bumpers where broken half way down the lane so a 2 foot stretch was sticking up. I understand this place is more about the atmosphere but after paying 20 an hour per person bowling I feel they can make the place nicer for how much money people are spending. Would rather go to bowlmor in Scottsdale then go to this place ever again.",

It's a tad bit pricey imo given that it cost for two people, two rounds of bowling about 25 bucks. The expectation is also that you'll buy food.   Food was okay. Same quality food you'd expect at your average bar. The service however was AWFUL.   Our waitress was named Jasmine. I had never been to a restaurant/bowling alley and had no idea waitresses come to you, so naturally I walked off asking where I can order a drink. First thing out of her mouth is \"what are you trying to do, get me fired?\" Of course not. What kind of chronic victim assumption is that? I dgaf about you random person, I want to buy a drink. Assume the best out of people, not that everyone is out to get you.  It gets better! The entire meal she acts like she doesn't want to serve us. At one point, she asks me on four different occasions if I'd like another drink (all of which I respond \"no thanks, I have to drive\").   I got the impression she felt we owed her something or that we were lucky to have her around.  I've worked in client service and relationship management for a decade and I can only say that Jasmine doesn't realize that client service starts with \"serving\" the needs of others. It isn't about her. Your comfort at work is put secondary to your clients and that's why you're getting paid to be there. I gave you a 10% tip and that was more than you deserved.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, my fiance and I were looking for something fun to do for his birthday weekend and we found Lucky Strike. It's located within a plaza of several different restaurants, a comedy club, and bars. We could hear the music blasting from inside and it quickly lured us in. When you walk in, there is a hostess stand which it appears that someone should be there to welcome you, but you actually have to circle around to your right and then that is where they greet you. We were greeted by such a nice and welcoming young man. We said we wanted to play pool and video games instead of bowling. He gave us the pool for free, potentially because we were being so nice to him? Usually I think it is $15. We played pool, headed to the small arcade room and played some games while my fiance enjoyed his beer. The following night his parents came to town and all four of us decided to rent a lane. I believe it's $60 for the lane for an hour +5 dollar shoe rentals. You get your own personal cocktail waitress who serves you your drinks. It was so much fun bowling in such a fun and exciting environment. I would definitely come back here!",

Did you notice I missed the bowling part? well I'm sure the bowling WOULD be fun, it we were able to bowl. We got there around 800 and were told there would be about a 45 minute wait. We decided to shoot some pool and have some drinks while we waited. The service...well, our server was nowhere to be found until my buddy flagged down a manager. We finally decided to leave around 1130, never got a chance to bowl. soooo 3 and a half hours and no bowling, that sucked. tremendously. Will I go back? Sure, why not. I love the location and the lounge is a great place to have some drinks and shoot pool. Is it all that and a bag of chips? Nope no sir",

It's a bit tough to get in so be sure to call first and make a reservation, if you can. Mostly good for the family. I mean, there's drinking, and semi-tightly-dressed waitresses and such but it's really not too bad IMHO. Our waitress was new in town and we had all these great conversations about the area. She made some perfect food suggestions and was super awesome in every way. A great place to go, I promise!  If you can bring enough people with you to book both lanes in your little booth area, I would suggest that. We shared our booth with this other group we didn't know and they were nice and all but kept making out with each other (there were 3 couples) right in front of our table. Of course, our table faced their lane. A little off-putting but not enough to not come back. Next time though, we will book in advance and make sure to bring non-make-out-in-front-of-you type friends. lol!",

    "text": "Lucky me!!  I see a lot of trips to Lucky Strike in my future!  I have been a few times now and have decided I really like the place, but not just for the bowling.  I like Lucky Strike for the good food, the cool vibe, and the specials.  The bowling is just an added bonus; a little something to get you moving so you're not just sitting in the same spot drinking and eating.  The lunch specials are great and so are the happy hour deals.  Where else can you get a (really good) lunch for just over $5?  Not many places that I know of, especially in the downtown area.  And for those hard days at work when I just want to vent over a beer with coworkers, Lucky Strike is perfect!  As far as the food goes, the mini burgers are fabulous; we had the blue cheese burger (with arugula) and the buffalo chicken (grilled chicken, not \"crispy\" aka breaded and fried.)  The pretzel sticks are yummy as are the beef skewers even if they are little on the sweet side.  In addition to lunch and happy hour, I have also been on a Saturday night and had a great time.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND making reservations ahead of time.  It worked out perfectly and there was quite a wait (2 hours) when we were done.  Just make sure to round up all your friends as we needed more than 10 people to keep our reservation for two lanes. We bowled for two hours and hit the bar after that. Staff was very friendly and accommodating; mostly good looking girls in tank tops and short skirts.  Overall, Lucky Strike is a great addition to downtown.  A cool bar that has bowling, not a dirty, smoky, bowling alley.  Go for lunch, go for happy hour, or go for nighttime fun on the weekend.  Either way, I think you'll have a good time.",

I am giving these guys 5 stars because I love to bowl and this place takes bowling to another level it is does not make me want to finish the phrase bowling with \"alley\"...Maybe bowling \"avenue\" :). A group of my friends went to the New Times 'Brews for Benefits\" and decided to stay for bowling. Think ultra lounge with the option to bowl. We shared some belgium fries and sliders and it definitely wasn't typical bowling alley fare. The service was great and the manager even came by and gave us all free game cards. If you are looking for a really good way to spend a Friday night these guys do a great job.  One note on the location--It is in the Southwest corner on the second floor on the corner of Jefferson and 1st Avenue.",

All in all bowling there is fun, but expensive. I've not been on a weekend yet, I wonder if they really uphold those crazy dress codes. (check their site)  The pros: - It makes downtown Phoenix more awesome.  - It's nice looking inside, clean and upscale appearance and decor - They have fun promos with the green pin (waitress witnesses you knock it down when it's pin 1 and you get a free app, etc). - The waitresses are usually great and friendly  The cons:  - It is really expensive bowling. -The shoes still smell even tho it's upscale -The house wine wine tastes like it came straight from a box, legit. It's so so so bad and at $6/glass or $4/glass/happy hour you'd hope for it to not be truly crappy wine. I wish they would kick it up a notch and get a bubbly on that list. They clearly make enough $$ off the bowling to afford to have wine that matches their dress codes.  - We've had a few, ahem, special waitresses who made their problems our problem or who left us thirsty for close to an hour. Thirsty bowlers are bad bowlers.",

The menu has recently changed for lunch, and the grilled cheese sandwich wasn't very good, however, I had such a good time taking an hour for lunch with friends, that this is still a 5 star review.    Lucky Strike is most famous for its nightlife, but I prefer lunch for pricing and It wasn't very busy.  So we didn't have any problem getting any lanes for lunch.    I am headed there again this week to show friends new to the valley.  I will trying the chicken sandwich, since it looked the best.",

This is definitely built more around the lounge concept than bowling lanes. A great place to have a b-day party with friends, they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went. They stocked local brew from Four Peaks which is awesome.  The downside is the service wasn't the best but this is a new location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will figure it out. Other than that we highly recommend checking it out, once CityScape is done it's gonna be great to hangout downtown.",

They said they had a big lunch rush, but I'm sure things are still picking up here. Everyone in my party got served on time and with appropriate happy hour orders, but I had my order screwed up a few times. And there were drinks that were brought out that no one had, and some of the servers (I think we had 5?) were confused. HOWEVER, I know that they're still learning, and that they're working out the kinks on their food and their service. I guess I just expected a lot more pretty early in their lifespan.  The bowling - well it was awesome.

I was a little alarmed that this business could be so poorly run that they can't even track their accounting correctly, and somehow discovered an additional $700 that they claim I owe them, over 4 months after squaring up in full...  Outrageous that a business could be so out of control.  I'd stay away!",

I am not even sure I would categorize it as just a boiling alley its really more of an upscale Dave and Busters that has bowling. The lanes are set up nicely with couches to get a relaxed feel the food was much better than a regular bowling alley the waitresses wear cute little outfits and if you don't want bowl they had an arcade, pool tables, and what looked like to be a dance floor at night... If you go during off hours the prices aren't too bad they have a special during the week that if you buy an entree you get free shoe rental and a free game of bowling then after that each game was $4 I believe. great place to do a team outing with your company or just get together with a group of friends.",

And as soon as we walked in we were in awe.  Its dark, sexy, and a lot going on.  There were about a dozen bowling lanes, pool tables, and a nice lounge area so you can sit watch your date bowl.  We arrived just before a company gathering had arrived and we were mistaken as being part of the group. So they were very happy to see us come in, and gave us the Royal treatment.   When they finally realized we were not part of the party, they asked politely to ask us to move because it was rented.    Nicole was very nice to us, and didn't charge due to the fact that it was a mix up and I didn't understand that it was rented for another party.  All in all it was a great experience. We had a fun time , even though it was cut short.  And I will definitely be back to play and order and try out the food.    Ive noticed people complain about the price of bowling, honestly it's a fair price, because it includes the ambiance as well and the music and good vibe this place gets.  The atmosphere of an environment is very classy and those are the types of places Id like to continue taking my date and or a group of people that Id like to impress. So 5 stars for great service, great time, and nice decor AND its in the downtown Phoenix scene, theres so much to do there, and now theres bowling!!!  NICE!!  Nicole provided AWESOME customer service!!  Great Job!",

My boyfriend is from NYC and I use to live there too, I'am always looking for the hottest places in the valley and this is 1 great spot. I like this place because it reminded me of the bowling alley on times square. We all had a great time thanks to our hostess/server named Lauren she was always there to serve us. I believe the server can give you a great or shitty experience. But Lauren she gave us a awesome experience! She served our meals and drinks quickly through out the whole night, she kept our table clean and clear always brought new dishware. We had a group of 10 people so we had a overload of food all of us was pleased with her professionalism and quickness. We must have asked her to serve us at least 10 times she worked quickly stayed kind, cheerful and funny, brought laughs to all of us. I've had rude servers in the past but Lauren treated us great I'am glad she didn't get annoyed. She always stopped by to see if we needed anything she arranged for my cake to be stored in the fridge I was a bit worried because my boyfriend spent $350.00 on the cake she reassured us everything will be fine and so on. I'd have to say lucky strike has a great worker  I think she should be recognized as employee of the month and for being such a hard worker possibly give her a pay increase for such outstanding work ethics. Thank you Lauren for making my birthday a great night! Next time you go to Luck Strike ask for Lauren she's a great server and don't forget to give her a BIG TIP!",

I can sit at home and have a better conversation with my dog.  No seriously, my dog speaks on command.  Sounds something like rooo-ooohhh-oooo. And she changes it up, too.  It's much more entertaining than most places around town.  Lucky strike is definitely a great find.",

They have 3 pool tables you can rent by the hour which was nice but watch out for the pillars that are right next to those tables! They can make some shots a lot more difficult than they need to be. If you want to bowl, get started before 6. Prices go from $8 per game with shoes to $50 per lane plus $8 per game with shoes.",

I was pretty impressed with this place: A) Along with the bowling area, there's a bar with pool tables, and a lounge section with a window facing the lanes where you can people watch. B) A live DJ played songs and mixed videos on the screens throughout the establishment. I liked the songs he was playing, and also takes requests if you want to hear something specific or change the genre. C) The waitresses are attentive, and don't mind splitting checks. Make sure you tell them beforehand to avoid any confusion.  **Bonus Points** Rack City came on, and one of the girls bowling next to us bent over and made her booty clap. I didn't even need to give her a dollar!  So, why only three stars?! Well, there's one REALLY big caveat to this place. Everything was clean with exception to the men's bathroom. It smelled like urine. Not just ordinary urine, but the kind you piss out when you've been drinking a little too much. GROSS. Annnnd it's all over the floor. Management -- please do something about this.  As long as you avoid the bathroom (if you're a man), you'll have fun here.",

The service was horrible, the amount of food was lackluster at best - the servers kept putting all the food at the tables by the bowling lanes and the people not bowling basically went hungry. When I brought this up to one of the servers he was very resistant to bringing out more food, even to the point of 'checking' to see if he could - when we booked we were promised continuous food.  The servers were not amazing and the bartender even worse. We had purchased drink tickets and also had opened up a tab at the bar, the bartender told our guests no drink tickets were required and basically ran up our tab at the bar. We had also purchased punches for the garage tickets to provide free parking for our guests, a good chunk of our guests ended up paying for their own parking. The bowling was a bit confusing over all and the guest check-in was not well run. It felt like everything could have been much more streamlined for the amount of money we spent.  The worse part - their event coordinator asked how the event was and I responded honestly, I never received any response, apology, NOTHING! WOW, don't think we will ever fork out that amount of money for our guests to leave hungry and underwhelmed again.",

    "text": "My first experience here was short, sweet, and to the point. It was pleasurable. In other words, I had been eagerly anticipating a return.  My second experience was cause enough to never return.   Picture this- there were perhaps 10-20 patrons in attendance, and mind you, 'twas about 1:15AM when we arrived. We had no intent to bowl as they have a spectacular looking bar that actually showcases local artists' works (I'd give them more than two thumbs up if I physically could for this) so the idea was to grab a few cocktails. Service was lackadaisical at best even though we were the only ones at the bar itself.  The epic fail that we ran headfirst into was the extreme absence of management, poor salesmanship on behalf of the bartenders, and the uber extremism of the  \"bouncers.\" Unfortunately whenever there are a bunch of guys behind me yelling at me to \"get out\" after the bartender has just delivered a drink, I am going to be a bit frustrated. By the way, it was still before 2:00AM.  Ultimately it's a shame. As I was walking out I told one of the \"bouncers\" that I would never be back, to which he replied, \"It's no skin off my back.\" For a service-based business in downtown Phoenix to have such a blatant disregard for any patronage they may acquire is simply dumbfounding. I live a few blocks away and whole-heartedly wanted this place to be a \"go to\" spot for when friends and family from other parts of the valley and from out of state visit, but if the \"bouncers\" are the only voice here then I would prefer to give my business to anywhere besides Lucky Strike.",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday early afternoon with two kids, ages 6 and 9. Didn't need a reservation because I think it only gets crowded in the late afternoon/evening. This is NOT 1980s bowling, people! Talk about posh, modern, clean, and awesome. It has a warm vibe, probably because it's pretty small. Great music, not overly loud. I will never look at bowling the same again! The \"bumpers\" for kids come up automatically for the kids' frames, which is pretty cool.    Ordered some food for lunch that they serve right at your lane. Chicken pillows (basically chicken won tons), small burger slider things, a turkey club (with an egg in it! Love it!), and the gluten free green chile tacos. We all LOVED everything. The food is pretty great for \"sports bar\" type of food, but especially for a bowling alley. Had a couple of beers and wine, pretty good selection for both wine & beer.   Played in the really upscale, modern arcade after bowling. It was empty, so that was great compared to the usual Peter Piper grossness/overcrowdedness of the weekends. I would happily pay more money to bowl, eat, and play games in style!!   The best part probably is the free photo booth thing where you can put in your email address and it mails the photos to you. The photos are great - they are surprisingly high resolution for a free photo station. We captured a fantastic family photo that will be a great memory of our first time at Lucky Strike! It definitely won't be our last. Can't wait to have a kid party or adults night out here.  The staff was really helpful and the waitress was always coming back to our lane to check on us. Places like Lucky Strike remind me why I'm happy to be a Phoenician!",

I know it had nothing to do with my \"let's try one of everything on the drink menu\" flight. I was tilted, sure, but I blame gravity.   The flatbread appetizer was scrumptious, just as the server said it would be. The tempura vegetables were pretty good too, although I ended up peeling off the breading and just eating the veggies...great flavor!   After playing a few games, we decided we just wanted to sit  (besides, the bowling was getting kinda pricey and we're really trying to give this \"frugal\" thing a whirl (yeah, we suck at it, but it can only get better right?), watch some sports and have a few more tasty beverages...this is where the stars got taken away.  The bar area was HELLA UNFRIENDLY! I couldn't even believe how pissy the clientele were, and the bartender was nowhere to be seen (probably scared off by those mean-mugging brutes hogging the good seats in front of the game)...no biggy, there are other bars with TVs out there. We'll *probably* go back to bowl at some point, but aren't in a big hurry to do so.",

The only thing that sucks about this place is the service. The staff had no sense of urgency and are not personable... Great venue tho ... With better service this place could be a go to for a lot of events",

    "text": "I heard that Lucky Strike opened downtown several months back, but I'm not a huge bowler, so I didn't really think twice about it.  However, a few weeks ago, Jared got it in his head that he really wanted to go there...  So last Friday night, while at dinner, we texted Amber and Dallas  to see if they spontaneously wanted to join us for  drinks and bowling at Lucky Strike... and sure enough, they did!  (Gotta love the spontaneity!)  Unfortunately for us, we weren't the only ones in the mood to check out Lucky Strike; the place was packed with an hour wait when we arrived!  We stuck it out though, and despite being on the pricey side, we did end up having a ton of fun!    A couple of rounds of drinks later, we finally did get a chance to bowl.  I was by far the worst bowler in our lane; (bowling is not my sport even sober).  Little known fact: Amber and Dallas are pretty serious bowlers... they both have their own bowling balls at home but they didn't bring them out with us this time.    I am sure I'll return to Lucky Strike; I think it's a great new addition to CityScape downtown, but next time  I'll call ahead to reserve a lane... and I may even try to brush up on my bowling skills before I return (or not)!",

We went for a friends birthday and had two lanes reserved. We were all ordering drinks it it took the waitress forever to get to us - despite the place not being THAT busy. Our first round of drinks came back all wrong and many were absolutely disgusting. Multiple drinks were sent back time and time again as they tasted as if they were being made by someone totally inexperienced. The manger came over and was still extremely unhelpful. I would skip this place if you are looking for good service and decent drinks.",

    "text": "I was so excited to come to this place after listening to my boyfriend brag about it so much. We love bowling and billiards as it is, but this was a different scene and we wanted to have some fun. I was so disappointed from the moment we chased our waitress down for a couple glasses of water until we left. After waiting 10 minutes to ask for the water, we had to wait 10 more for it to be delivered. Maybe the waitress was overwhelmed with her 3 other groups, no biggie. But when we wanted to order some food we had to chase her down, again. After ordering some food she decided to bring our check to the table, without asking if we wanted to order anything else, which we did, by the way. So after that we got the memo that our business wasn't wanted and waited to finish our game of bowling. As we were deciding on paying to start a new game, the waitress comes over and asks if she could close our tab out...? I felt as if we didn't have a choice to stay open so we confusingly said okay. When she brought the bill out to us, I paid in cash and she owed me change but never came back to give me the remainder..? Didn't even bother to ask, \"do you need cash back?\" Or anything. Just kept the change. After still trying to keep my hopes up for this place I just couldn't. Oh, and $13 for a shot of Jameson? I've never heard of that until tonight. I understand that it was a Monday night, but no matter what, service should always be up to par no matter how slow or how busy the establishment is. As a waitress myself, this whole experience had me in shock. Managers should focus on keeping their waitresses on 10 instead of playing pool and drinking iced tea all night long. Service makes people return or not.",

    "text": "Very disappointed in the management staff this evening. They decide to check ID's at the door (which they had never done before) just to tell us that \"it's always been the rule\". As the manager is telling us that \"we start checking IDs at 9PM\" a family with 2 kids come walking out. So you start checking IDs tonight, say that you check ID's at 9pm, and then a family of 4 comes walking out (mind you it's 10pm). So is there any part of the rules that you just implemented you adhere to? My favorite part of this whole thing is the manager denying us service because he contradicted everything he said and made himself look like an idiot. So we get the short end of the stick. Great. I really hope you rethink how you run your establishment because tonight was simply disappointing.",

    "text": "Lucky Strike strikes the wrong chord with me.  I've been here to this location four times.  I have been to another location out of state on a couple occasions, as well.  Since my first visit, the bartending staff has improved LEAGUES.  The women working at the bar last Friday night were actually personable and friendly.  That is saying something, as in the past the people working at the bar were... to put it nicely... AWFUL PEOPLE.    It's a great CONCEPT, but it just doesn't impress me.  The food is hit or miss, but it is usually miss.  Some food that comes out of their kitchen is just awful.  They don't ever seem to have drink specials... at least when I've gone.  The bowling is pretty expensive compared to Brunswick Zone and... honestly... I prefer Brunswick.    If it was up to me, I would avoid Lucky Strike altogether.  Sure, it has a nice downtown location.  Still, there are so many better places to spend my hard earned money downtown.",

Soooooo disappointing and left me wishing I had gone elsewhere.  Definitely never going there AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In addition we had bottle service and the server never was around I mean it was VIP and we ended up serving ourselves and I found the server eating at the bar way to go!!! Worst experience ever.",

Hot waitresses, disco bowling, DJ spinning, loungin' on the couch and clubbers dancin' away.  There was free food & drinks all night woohoo!! (Granted VIP night before grand opening).  Still the place was popping.  The bowling system was off the chart and high tech - yeah it was for bowling.  Located in CityScape; this is definitely gonna be the next hot spot in downtown PHX.  Which is great since downtown is so lacking in the night life!  As for the food man it was good.  Not your typical slider I tell ya.  The ambience is just right - how they got that high-end bowling and bar lounge to work??  Beats me but  it does; I'm gonna have my birthday here! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "When I walked in to Lucky Strike, I immediately noticed the bar to my left. It was  a very long bar with a ton of stools as well as a few tables. I almost liked the bar area more than the bowling area, because it was so roomy. The lanes, on the other hand, were pretty ridiculously crowded.  First off, there weren't that many lanes. While there were also several pool tables in the building, the actual bowling area was pretty small, with only a dozen lanes. Each lane had some couches and additional stool seating behind the lanes, but to get by everyone at your lane, you really had to wiggle around them because the couches were so close to the balls. It was incredibly awkward and forces you to get super-close to the people you're with.  Also, while there were some televisions broadcasting sports above the lanes, one of the screens simply scrolled through random pieces of art. I much rather would have watched music videos of the songs that were playing (which were not good, by the way-Jamiroquai, seriously?!). The whole art thing was sort of bizarre to me and actually made the place seem less hip.  The crowd there, surprisingly, was mostly suits who probably came straight from work. I was surprised the place was as busy as it was. While our lane waitress was super-friendly, service was really slow, and someone in our party said it almost would have made more sense just to walk to the bar ourselves for drinks.  Prices vary depending on times and days, but if you're going to bowl Friday and Saturday nights after 6 p.m., it'll cost a whopping $39.95 per lane per hour. That, to me, is ridiculous when so many other lanes have unlimited cosmic bowling (with good music and music videos) for only $20 a person. Don't go to Lucky Strike-try Scottsdale Lanes instead.",

    "text": "Been to LS in Phoenix a few times. Everything from a party of 25 (with kids) to a group of 4 entertaining out-of-towners.  Each time was a success but that success comes with a price.   The bowling  is expensive. $40 per hour for the lane plus shoes; we dropped $60 before we even ordered our first drink. That being said, you're paying for atmosphere and the decor is great, as is the service. Very attentive and they seemed nonplussed by the children running around. That's always nice (sometimes you just have to bring them along and kids love to bowl, right?)  Their menu is impressive as well. When my foodie friends come to town and decide against bowling because they hate \"bowling alley food\", this is a great option because this is definitely a few notches above typical alley fare! My favorite items are the Pretzel Dippers and the Chicken Pillows. Burgers are quite tasty as well. My husband had a salad that was spicy and satisfying. Food and drink prices are reasonable.  I've never been to their happy hour, but am planning an outing in the near future!",
