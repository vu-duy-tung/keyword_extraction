By the time we got butter the toast was cold & butter came from refrigerator.  Got Neapolitan  to go- it wasn't fresh. Eggs served at least 5 min before spinach pie which just had to be reheated.  Might try again for lunch but wasn't impressed w breakfast.",

There were plenty of deserts made fresh from scratch. After eating their food, I can't wait to go back for desert.",

    "text": "Believe the hype.   After several awful experiences at Pomegranate, we were happy to see a new breakfast option open. Check out my review of Pomegranate for more details.   We've been in about 3 times now and loved it all 3 times. There are so few places like this anymore. The amount of pride put into everything they do is so incredible!  So far, I don't think we've found a single thing that isn't made from scratch. My girlfriend asked for hot sauce. One of the owners kindly obliged. When he got back he brought 2 store bought hot sauces along with a cup of his homemade. He said we could try the store bought \"not so good one\", or try his. He was absolutely right. We used the whole cup.   The pride even goes into the water that is used for coffee. We don't drink soda. We always order water with meal. The same owner said to make sure to use the water on the soda machine because they use a top notch filtration system.   There was a family with a toddler right next to us. At one point, the child had dropped a small toy on the floor. The owner came from behind the counter, actually wiped the toy off with a clean towel, and gave it to the parents. On my first visit, one of the owners took my 11 year old daughter to watch her decorate cookies for an upcoming birthday party. She gave my daughter a sample as well. That's service.   The breakfast and pastries are delicious. I love cannolis and this place has them. Naturally, all aspects of them, including the shells, are made from scratch.   So if you have the option, skip Pomegranate and go here. It's a way better experience all around.",

My husband had a piece of Baklava that being Arabic I can tell you was not good. There was no rose water or orange blossom, just sad.",

The only reason I did not give 5 stars was a couple of items they need to improve and lock down or folks will not return, even if the food is great.  Got our coffee...no cream.  Requested silverware.  There was no dressing on the side salad, had to ask.  Toast barely toasted and no perceivable butter on it.  It seems they need someone to pay more attention to these details.  They also need to advertise more - this place is a mile from me and I never knew it existed for 4 months! We think the prices are reasonable - much more so than Snooze - and the owners are charming.  Just needs some guidance.  Please don't close!",

He seemed bothered we had even shown up. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and regular drip coffee, my wife ordered a spinach pastry and a cookie. We paid. Received only a cookie and a table #. No coffee. Sat down at a table. Salt and pepper shakers were empty. No silverware and no one brought any over. After 5 minutes, I had to ask for my coffee. It's was brought over with no sugar, cream or spoon. Coffee was definitely water downed w hot water. Not a fresh brew. Worst coffee I've ever had. After about 10-15 minutes I received my amateur hour sandwich. The menu stated it as fresh baked bread. What I received was a panini sandwich w a microwaved egg inside. The bread was white bread with no butter heated up in a panini maker. It was a top 5 worst meal of my whole life. The topper was my wife received her spinach pasty last after about 20 minutes. When we asked for it, he said they were \"freshly making\" it. When it came out, it was clearly a microwaved pastry that was still cold in the middle. We couldn't leave this place fast enough.  Do us all a favor and either hire a competent restaurant manager or shut this down until you figure it out. Embarrassing to have a breakfast place like this in Tukee. Never again...",

The food is made with the finest ingredients.....real butter, imported chocolate and more.  It is also made with lots of love and it's obvious.  Desserts are beautiful and are displayed beautifully too.  EarlyBaker isn't a chain restaurant, so don't expect chain-restaurant quality food or prices.  You can tell from the outside that this is a unique place to dine....it's open and light and very welcoming.  I feel comfortable going in here by myself because I usually run into a friend; and if I don't, I am comfortable reading my book and enjoying a cappuccino or iced tea.  OH!....they also have patio dining, so it's dog friendly.  And with the nice weather upon us, bring a book or some friends and a deck of cards and enjoy the outdoors.  EarlyBaker....welcome to Ahwatukee!  I'm glad you're here!",

Omg to die for, ask for pita bread with it. You can get it with or without kabob. The owner makes custom cakes that look like they are too beautiful to eat. If you want to host private parties they are very affordable. I am hosting one there in June and can not wait to have more of their middle eastern food. Go there for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. You will not be disappointed!!!!! Here is a picture of a cake there.",

It had bananas and strawberries floating in it which had also taken on the odd taste of the syrup. My husband got the breakfast burrito which wasn't wrapped like a burrito & looked more like a calzone. The taste was nothing special and not worth going back for.",

The place is cute as far as design. When I walked up to order I wasn't greeted by the owner I'm assuming.

Flaky, light on the outside and slightly chewy with just the right amount of sweetness inside. Absolute perfection.   Was in Ahwatukee again this morning and decided to stop in for a full breakfast. Glad I did because the Egg Boat is also one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. A light bread crust w three cheeses topped with two perfect eggs and served with a small greek salad and roasted potatoes and zucchini. Again, just perfect.   In Arcadia, Scottsdale or Tempe this place would have a line waiting out the door every morning and be beating off professional reviewers with a stick.",

    "text": "I had a delightful first time official visit at the Early Baker.  We were a large group so they put us In a private dining room.  We felt right at home!  Adam the owner was prompt at taking our food selections and memorized our names (17 of them).  I had their almond croissant once so l knew they had top quality baked goods (a friend brought us their croissants once). Today l had their mango smoothie, it was delicious! Ron had a plain croissant, rich in buttery flavors, big, fluffy and flaky.  In no particular order our group picked French Toasts, Lemon crepes, steak & egg, baked egg dish and a large dish of other pastries.  The big winner is... The Lemon Crepe! Oui, oui. Crepe oozes with a vibrant lemon cream, topped with lemond curd (l think).  Next runner up is the French Toast, a thick homemade brioche smothered in syrup. There were a few Turkish coffees at our table.  It smelled like cardamom and that enticing dark roast Arabica coffee grain. I skipped their coffee today as l had already infused my body with caffeine in the early morning.  The \"steak\" and eggs is in fact a roast beef. One of our friends at the table would not have ordered it knowing this.  I'm confident that Early Baker will edit this erroneous description promptly. We paid for our breakfast at the counter. In return we were handed a card with 20% off at our next visit! I found Early Baker to be an outstanding new addition to Ahwatukee.  I took a look at their showcased pastries (watch my video), and l was very impressed by their pastry chef' skills. It looks like the perfect bakery to order a custom cake for a special event.  We were all very pleased and enthused.  Bravo Early Baker",

    "text": "I went here for the first time on Tuesday as a part of a book discussion group. The book we're reading is called The Go Giver by Bob Burg.  I didn't order any food because I arrived to the meeting at the last minute. The food that my companions ordered looked really tasty and they confirmed it as such. Next week, I'll get breakfast.  The owner brought us some samples (full-size slices) of cake and cheesecake to try. The cheesecake was amazing! Now, maybe you're thinking that \"everyone likes cheesecake, so big deal?\"   Well, as it happens, I don't really like cheesecake. It seems like a very dense and unsophisticated dessert to me. I'd rather have something like Tiramisu or Creme Brulee. This cheesecake had a lightness to it that could only come from someone that has been baking for years. Really exceptional bakers KNOW exactly the moment they've stirred enough for the texture of a bread, cake or pastry to be perfect. This cheesecake had that exceptional quality to it.  More than the food though, EarlyBaker set itself apart from most everywhere I visit in this valley, having a joyful and upbeat owner. He really exemplifies the spirit of the book that we're reading. He loves people and it shows and I genuinely appreciate that!  As for the naysayers about this business, I'd say that if they had a complaint or grievance about the quality or value of the food the owner would have loved to hear from them directly. I know he would take the time to listen and make the situation more positive for them.  Highly recommended.  Some music for atmosphere would be nice though.  Next time I'll add photos. I didn't think I'd like the cheesecake, so I ate it before I took a picture. D'oh!  :-D",

The restaurant is well designed both inside and outside eating area. It is very clean and cozy!. Adam, the owner was so friendly and always made sure that I was happy with my food. I will definitely come back to explore more their menu!",

Needless to say, I was amped to try it.    On the morning I arrived it was dead quiet (no background music).  That was corrected later about 20 minutes later but it was a real weird vibe to start.  The folks working the counter didn't seem to have much training.  I ordered an iced coffee which was served to me in a coffee mug with no ice.  It was kind of embarrassing to explain to someone working in a breakfast restaurant that that isn't the way it works.    For food I went with some pastries.  The scone was good.  The croissant was good.  The croissant was also $4.  For a mid-size croissant.  Breakfast entrees on the menu started at about $11.  There is a glaring lack of value.  If you have two people eating breakfast items it'll be north of $30.    It's a new restaurant so I'm aware that there will be some issues. I will give it another try but my first impression doesn't have me hurrying back.",

The pastries and deserts are the best. The owners are warm and eager to have customers linger and enjoy the atmosphere as well as the food. It's not the place for a big Sunday brunch, but rather the perfect place to bring a book or friend to sip coffee and snack on a variety of yummy baked goods.  This is what I've tried so far: 1) Home made cheese cake heavenly, unlike anything I've had before. Not too sweet, blueberries mixed in, slightly lemony.  2) fresh croissants, almond croissants are my favorite Plain croissant was the best I've ever had 3) Macaroons are amazing  4) Latte with the house vanilla is the best  5) Lemon bars are yummy 6) hummus is yummy, authentic and fresh with warm pita and veggies 7) rice pilaf was fragrant and baked in a flaky pocked",

Then, a large dish filled with the most delicious chicken parm I have had in years.  Perfect thinly pounded breast, breaded and cooked to tender perfection, accompanied by fettuccini with a wonderful marinara sauce.  Took half home as it was enough for two people.  Adam, the owner, is fun, friendly and can't do enough to make his customers feel like guests in his own home.

My crepe tasted like it had been Pre-made and then rolled to order.   My wife ordered a side of potatoes and got charged for a meal.   My daughter ordered what was touted as breakfast eggs and vegetables...and the veggies turned out to be spinach.   We had to ask for water.   We had to ask for table service (napkins and silverware).   For what should be a family-friendly place, both high chairs were in use when we arrived.   The location is awesome.

I've even ordered it for friends and brought it home to them. Adam suggested a smoothie one time for me and that was also handmade and very tasty.

    "text": "Love this place! If you're looking for fabulous baked goods, a warm and cozy local place and owners who stand by their food, than this is the place for you! The best croissants in AZ are right here; had the plain and chocolate which is to die for especially when heated up! The cream puffs and eclairs especially are just amazing. The cream filling tastes fresh, light and creamy and the Belgian chocolate on top is the perfect sweetness. We had a taste of their Japanese cheesecake, why, because I asked about it and the owner(the baker herself) let us try it. It was very light and airy, different than NY cheesecake of course, but deli inns different way.  The best so far is their brioche French toast; OMG Snooze, watch out. We were talking about Snooze and how delicious theirs was but Adam challenged us to try his. He was right, his is better! Fluffy brioche bread, homemade syrup, creme fraiche, bananas and strawberries. The look on my son's face was priceless (wish I took a Picture).   What makes these delicious are the ingredients and the fact that the owner/baker knows what she's doing! I love the passion for their food and Adam's conviction that theirs is the best! If not, he says he'll give you your money back. That has not happened to us so we're heading there today for breakfast!  No, it's not cheap but the quality of the food is what you're paying for. We love the neighborhood feel and the fact that we're supporting a local independent venture!",

He stated they start at 2 in the morning and bake everything fresh. Anything that isn't used throughout the day is donated to the food bank. They have what they call a soft opening with a limited menu option. But even with that there's plenty to choose from so I didn't feel as though I had to settle on my breakfast choice. I ordered a vanilla latte and due to the opening they had ran out of vanilla but the owner came by and said no worries I'll have the chef in the back make some fresh vanilla from the beans we have and and get that into your latte. Food was very good service is great owner goes out of his way not sure what else you can ask for from a restaurant. Definitely going to be returning soon.",

The location is great for Ahwatukee residents looking for another place to eat. Comfortable chairs and tables with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.   The owner and employees were incredibly friendly - they asked my name, made a few pastry recommendations and even gave me a free (very tasty) cookie. I was there on my computer for a while and they were attentive without being intrusive the entire time.   I was going to order a croissant but they were already out - instead I ordered a pastry with a cheese filling and one with spinach, both savory with flaky pastry. My latte was also very good.   I'm excited Early Baker is in the neighborhood and look forward to trying them again.",

The service is a little bit slow BUT it's expected since they are cooking things fresh, also it's a family owned place and you just feel good eating here.   Cannoli here are actually very good and can tell they are made with real ricotta cheese. Almond croissants are also excellent!",

We were out running errands and decided to stop to have breakfast and we chose this place because of all the great yelp reviews. I can't say enough how Adam the owner was very hospitable and eager to make us happy.  Not only did my wife's omelette plated perfectly cooked, it requires no need of salt or pepper.  My American sandwich on pumpernickel was very flavorful coupled with a lot of fruit. I would recommend their Tiramisu which was complementary offered by Adam. He also recommended that we return for the lamb chops.  I'm happy to find a place like this that's local, not busy, not a chain and they  focus on quality versus quantity. They have a dog friendly patio with shade, too. A+ for my fellow dog lovers. There is also a private meeting space that can be used for off-site meetings. They also offer catering and delivery when in need.",

How disappointing it is when you waitress does not know it either.  I asked for recommendations for my toddler that were not sweet, and she just did not know.  She said... well, \"all kids eat french toast\". what a great advice!... After exploring the menu I decided to go for a spinach crepe to go. After 10 min she brings it on a plate without the side salad, that according to the menu comes with it.  Then she says... ooh do you want a salad? and do you want this to go? Then she comes back with just the crepe in a box, so I told her again: \"and the salad?\".  I think she really tries but she is just really bad at this.  She should know the menu though, and know what comes with what. 2. They said on the website they open at 6:00 a.m.  Please don't waste your time. They open at 8:00 a.m. Mon-Fri and 7:00 a.m. Sat-Sun.  3. According to their website, they offer free coffee on Fridays from 6:00 a.m. (When they are closed) to 10:00 a.m.  The waitress didn't have any idea about this and was charging me the coffee.  4.  Foodwise, it's ok.  I had the chocolate croissant. Not the best, not the worst.   5. Lots of waste on to-go boxes.  I just regret coming here, having Pomegranate Coffee just some feet away.",

I can honestly say that there is no better value for the quality of food you receive than at this restaurant. I recently had their german chocolate cake and it was the richest most delicious price of cake i've ever had in my life. If you're in Ahwatukee stop by and check them out.",

There are always times that you choose a chain such as snooze, first watch... Blah blah. But there really is no comparison to local delicious eating that Adam and his family provides. Early Baker is by far the best place we have ever stopped in to eat at. Whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the Quality of food and presentation is unmatched. The only reservation we have in coming here is that we know we are going to be splurging on some of the best pastries anywhere. How could you not? They are made in house!  We love it here. They are worth the drive, and they are certainly worth supporting local business and not a chain. Please go! You wont be disappointed.",

When we walked in we were greeted warmly and informed they have FREE coffee on Fridays! I couldn't really decide on what I wanted so I got the brioche French toast, and the turkey mushroom pesto crepe. We were also told that they have the BEST croissants we have ever tasted, which I rolled my eyes at the comment because I don't like when people over-promise and I typically end up disappointed. To my surprise, the croissants were excellent (I got the plain with homemade apricot and strawberry jelly), probably the best I've had outside of France.  They told us that everything is organic, non-GMO, and homemade. I don't know how to confirm the organic, non-GMO claim, but everything definitely tasted fresh and homemade.  Very good experience and we will definitely be back.",

Their pastries change on a daily basis so its fun to stop by and see what they are making today. Their food menu is still developing. I love the mushroom soup, Brioche French toast. Mixed berry crepes and Turkey pesto sandwich.  If you are looking to have a small private party. They have a tea room that holds about 25 people.  Great variety of appetizers and dessert you can order for your private party.  Custom cakes. Local Peixoto coffee. The owners are really nice and are trying very hard to please their customers. This is not a fast food place . If you want a 99cents meal please go to McDonalds.  This is fresh food prepared for you. If you don't like something talk to the owners. About the facility: They have WIFI . Comfortable lounge area you can sit work and enjoy your coffee. Nice patio we can enjoy now that its getting cooler. Really pleasant views and friendly staff. YES they are new so please be patient.",

It was super light and fluffy yet decadent, i loved it. Im not too into pastries, but my mom tried them and she loved every single one. Ive taken so many friends here, it has such a nice atmosphere, and its a great place for students to go if they want to hang out or study as they have wifi and its pretty quiet in there.

And of course the food, tea, and custom Eiffel Tower cake was all top notch!! This beautiful family have hearts of gold and they truly treat every customer with sincere love and care!!

We liked it so much that we returned another day during our friend's' visit. We sat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the beautiful weather. I like having a breakfast menu all day. The pastries in the case look good, too.",

Walked in about 15 min before they closed and were given the royal treatment!! Everything looked so amazing and we couldn't decide so the owners offered to give us a sampling of several of their desserts! They were all amazing! My favorites were the chocolate croissants and lemon bars!! They've got so many influences from around the world in their baking and we really just enjoyed getting to know the owners and hearing their stories. They set us up in their high tea room and just gave the best service!! Will definitely be coming back again and again!",

Somehow all of our sandwiches were exactly the same with the exception of a puny piece of sausage and bacon on the side with mine. Which was actually supposed to be on the sandwich. Each sandwich was accompanied by about 5 potatoes and the most bland Greek salad I've ever had. Everything tasted like it was pulled straight from the frozen section of frys and microwaved. Yet it took almost 25 minutes to get our food; no silverware, no condiments, no salt and pepper. Coffee was served luke warm and I had to get up and bring my cup across the room to where the cream and sugar were. Just a very weird, Uninviting setup. Nobody asked how we were, how the food was, or if we needed anything. Will not be returning.",

The sandwich with only water to drink was $13 with tax. Hardly any baked goods in case and it was 10 am in.the morning. Was disappointed to say the least. No friendly service when placing the order and server kept trying to give us some one else's order. To many other good places to go to so probably won't go back.",

Heads up: It's in the same parking lot as Trader Joe's, and parking can get crazy at rush shopping hour.   I invited a foodie friend so we could experience the place together. I really liked the casual \"hang-out\" atmosphere the couches and mix and match tables/table heights gave the space.  More like walking into someones home and hanging out. Nice. Oh-they have a pretty nice outdoor area that is comfy looking too.  You walk up and order at the front, they give you a number to place on the table you pick-then they deliver your food. Don't forget to leave a tip in the tip jar!  We ordered the chicken sausage omelette. Was VERY delicious. The potatoes that came with were a bit boring, but the flavors of the omelette made up for it.   The portions were big and we were stuffed, and chatting away in bliss.   I came for dinner after this and ordered clam linguine and the flavor was off to me-tasted like a lot of dill pickle juice in the sauce? The portion was good, the clams fresh, but I could barely finish because of the sauce. Hmmm... Figured I'd give dinner ONE more try.  Glad I did. The Chicken Parmigiana was super delicious. I hit that plate running and hardly came up for air!  The side salad was very fresh and had great variety of greens. Dressing yummy too. Oh yeah-NOW we're hitting on all 8 cylinders.  Last meal I tried a Mexican breakfast burrito. It was sort of panini style-which sounds weird, but weirdly worked. Very good. Man-so big I could barely squeeze it all down-but I managed. I have pic's of it...  The owners have put a lot of thought into the decor and comfort-it shows.  I will be back often, and happily introduce friends to it.",

It comes half with meat and half vegan grape leaves. I couldn't tell which one I liked better because they were both delicious! For my meal I ordered the salmon entree. First to come out was a starter Greek salad, it was light and delicious! My entree arrived and was plated beautiful! I'm telling you this was the best salmon I have ever had. It was so FRESH!!!! It was juicy and seasoned to perfection. The salmon laid on top of Spanish rice and roasted vegetables. It also came with bread. All this for $15???? This is what I would expect from a restaurant on the beech being sold for $50. Seriously amazing. The owner was awesome and treated us to a slice of lemon meringue pie. It was literally to die for. It was literally gone in seconds and my mom and I fought over the last bite. I really can't wait to come back and try more things from their menu! They have beautiful looking pastries and cakes on display. Overall the restaurant was very clean and so cute! I'm really glad to have found this ahwatukee gem.",

I called ahead to see if they still had danishes since it was a little bit later in the morning and I know bakeries can sell out. They said they had plenty of danishes left, cheese and strawberry danishes. I had initially asked for a cheese danish, the man on the phone said \"yes we have cheese\" and then he said \"we have some cheese and some strawberry\" great! We headed over about 10 minutes after our phone call and the interaction we had was so uncomfortable.   A young girl who was working kept looking at us but never said a word. The man behind the counter was taking a very long time with the men ordering in front of us. We stood in front of the pastry case and looked at two sad looking dried out danishes, hoping those weren't the only ones. Finally the man came up to us and asked what we wanted. We said we called and asked about the danishes and would like 2 cheese danishes. He said \"we are out\". Ok? We called 10 minutes ago and were told there were plenty. He said he would go check in the back for more. He never came back to us but instead came out and started making coffee drinks and completely ignored us. Never said another word. It was so awkward and some of the worst customer service I have experienced. We walked out since neither of the employees cared to help us. (Mind you, the restaurant was dead on a Saturday morning, only two people there)  We came back the next day to give them another shot. The same man was there, not very friendly and the same dry looking pastries in the case. I was so over it at this point that I bought two of the \"strawberry & cheese\" danishes (turns out they don't have cheese AND strawberry, it's a combo). We got home to eat them and they were terrible. Dry as dry can be, very little filling and literally a tablespoon sized chunk of cold cream cheese. A horrible representation of what a danish is and what a bakery is. So dissatisfying and I will not return.",

It had a sort of sour taste to it and I'm not sure I liked it.  I've also been by to try the German chocolate cake. That cake is very good. It isn't dry and has excellent flavor. All the ingredients in the cake seemed high quality.",

I probably had one of the best chia (dirty) at the location. They also have Turkish coffee that I will return to try later. The vegan burrito that I had was delicious, and i would definitely have the potatoes inside again. The salsa is spicy so be warned. Happy eating.",

I am all about details. The setting was really nice and comfortable with a good, music vibe. The lighting was perfect. Very clean and welcoming. Yummy pastries ready on the counter glass-case. We had fresh hummus with a strip of olive oil and homemade, soft pitas with cucumber and tomato slices. Very delicious and plentiful. I had their strawberry mousse cake with an ice tea. It was really good!! Heavenly.  A huge cake slice, enough for two that I had to share with Kim. Our visit turned out to be 3 hours long.  Time flew but we did not notice. That just shows how nice it was.   Students, if you are looking for an alternative place to study or hangout with your friends- Early Baker is great. Thank you Adam Halik for taking care of us. It was really nice. Glad you are here.   -Melissa Lemme, Kim Kendall and myself. #Ahwatukee411",

It was a very filling and tasty meal for 15$ not bad for lamb! The hummus and pita was delicious also. The food appears to be made in house and is fresh and full of flavor. Took home a macaroon, cannoli and a Swiss Roll. Treats are spot on too We will definitely be back!  Thanks again Adam!",

The waitress didn't know if they served chai lattes, had to go ask. Didn't know what kind of pastries were available, had to go ask. Each time she was gone a long time. There was not comfortable seating or atmosphere. The drink and pastry were nothing better than I could have made at home. Maybe worse. It was 11am on Sunday morning so maybe they would be better in the morning.",

I have to say that I am surprised that it wasn't much busier but I am also not complaining about that. The menu has several options. I think that it's awesome that they serve breakfast all day. We tried a few different egg sandwiches and a berry crepe. The owner also brought us a chocolate croissant on the house. Everything tasted delicious and was reasonably priced. The decorations were adorable and it had a very homey cafe vibe. I felt very comfortable the whole time and picture this being a spot where I can grab a coffee, snack, and do homework. Very nice people and vibe! I was very impressed and will be back. Thank you for the hospitality!",

    "text": "My review is based on their breakfast menu, we did not try any of their pastries which had good reviews. Anytime a new place opens up in Ahwatukee, we are always excited to try it. A group of friends went there for breakfast and was under whelmed. First of all, don't call it steak and eggs when it's thinly sliced roast beef. That is very misleading. Also, when ordering a side of turkey sausage, keep in mind it is $3 for ONE 2\" mini sausage sliced in half. I had the Early American which consisted of a toasted white plain bread sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon. Not real bacon, but turkey bacon. I'm ok with turkey bacon, but real bacon is entirely different. It was served with 2 slices of cucumbers, 2 wedges of tomatoes and seasoned potatoes. The potatoes looked so good, but was so disappointed when we took a bite. It was not cooked enough. A friend had the French toast drizzled with strawberries which looked amazing and she enjoyed it.   The portions were really small as well and we spent about $40 for 2 breakfasts entrees and 2 drinks. That's a lot of money for mediocre breakfast to begin with and to have the portions small and not very good, is disappointing to say the least. Unfortunately, all of us don't think we will return. They are nice there, but we felt like we wasted our money. We would've been ok with smaller portions for the price if the food was better quality.  The other reviews on the pastries seem to be really good. If that's the case, focus on the bakery items and make that the star and incorporate that into your menu.",

    "text": "On the fence with this place. The decor is really cute, they did a great job with making it comfy and feeling like your at home. The service and food are really lacking. My hubby and I went for lunch and walked in with one other table of two ahead of us. There were only a few things on the menu that we'd consider trying so that's not a good start. There was a large group already seated in a side room and looked to be eating already and another couple that were finished so getting trendy to leave. That left 4 people only to have to cook for and I guess they felt the same as us regarding the menu cause they we ordered the same things except my hubby and me just ordered water with our meal. The lady at the counter who took our order got us the water right away but didn't bother to tell us that it was self service around the corner. Also what looked to be the owner was pacing around like he was either waiting for something or lost but didn't appear friendly at all. Not even a hey thanks for coming in to try the place. Anyway as far as the wait for the food wow!  Okay so your making 4 sandwiches, 2 of each kind and after abt 20 minutes of waiting the lady who took both our orders comes out to asks each of our tables to confirm our orders. That's 1 turkey panini and 1 chicken wrap per table. And then we waited another 20 minutes. Seriously people 40 minutes for sandwiches? I get made to order but really? So the paninis come out first. One for each table they looked nicely presented with a side salad then another few minutes she brings the chicken wrap with a side of what looked to be leftover breakfast potatoes. We split our food so that we each could taste it. I could tell immediately we were going to be really disappointed with our lunch. The panini literally had 2 very thinly sliced pieces of turkey and was served between whole wheat pots warmed but definitely not toasted on a panini press. The overall flavor was okay but nothing special. It needed more meat for a $11 sandwich. Yes, $12 for 2 slices of deli meat. Terrible. Then for the chicken wrap.  A huge tortilla with very little stuffing. We weren't surprised there. The chicken we abt 4oz and very little lettuce and a sprinkling of tomato.  But the garlic sauce they use as mayo was way over powering. Like kill a vampire too much. And it tasted to be garlic just mixed with Greek yogurt and a lot of garlic. It was not good and again another $12. This place is not gonna make it. The bakery didn't really offer a lot of what the demographics of the area will purchase. Some muffins and a couple variety of cookies won't cut it.  I couldn't tell if they are trying to be a bakery that sells some sandwiches and salads or a restaurant that sells bakery goods. Either way I don't see these owners making it but they did a great job of cleaning the place up from the pit that los dos left.",

For a fast casual it was a bit pricey- our bill was 47 without tips for 3 dishes and a cafe mocha.

The prices can be steep but you're paying for quality. I hope with time and better product sourcing the prices will become a bit more reasonable, because then I'd make the drive from Mesa weekly to indulge!",

They also bake their own gluten free pita creation so I look forward to trying a pita gyros or other soon. Nice meeting room for birthday parties, Moms lunch etc. Recommended !

    "text": "Talk about a hidden gem down near the Ahwatukee Foothills!  The Early baker offers a unique vibe from the relaxing lounge area to enjoy a coffee, to your traditional sit down tables and lastly the big tables that feel you are at home eating dinner with your family! The inside is warm and has cute branding of the rooster to align with the early baker aesthetic!  They offer breakfast all day, baked goods, delicious Mediterranean entrees and sandwiches. Plus if you are looking for traditional Turkish coffee, this is the place! Serving Illy Coffee and their lattes are light and more traditional lattes that you would expect in Europe.   My top favorite dishes were the french toast which was made with homemade bread and it seriously made all the difference. Not sickish sweet but the flavors were amazing! My next favorite was the lamb! You can get lamb here for $15.95! I am telling you, the flavors in the lamb were blended to perfection and reminded me of eating greek food back on the East coast with my family. The mixed grill platter had some amazing seasoned meat! If you love kebabs, this is the plate for you.   I cannot think of anything I did not like here. The cheesecake was out of this world. With the lightness of the cheescake and the lemon that cut the sweetness, it was soooo good! I will be back for more because the Early Baker blew it away with taste, hospitality and homie vibes.  Also they have a private event tea room for rental and offer gluten free options for their pies and some treats. So check them out, its my secret go to place in the foothills!",

He gave each of us a chocolate chip cookie that we all thought would be hard and crumbly but wasn't!!! I would go back for those cookies alone!! We got a 'sample' of most of the items. Each one was as good as the next! What a great local place! I recommend this place and will be back often!   Update :: website says 6-9pm daily That is not the case. So sad to see it closed by 830.  Been there a few times to find it not open when they say they are.  Time to update the website to reflect correct hours.",

My friend loved the BBQ chicken panini and we got to taste 2 delicious soups. The only thing we didn't get to partake in were the delicious looking baked goods.

I really dislike some places where the fountain drinks are watered down, but this place has the best fountain drinks I've had. Beyond refreshing and just the perfect amount of flavor/fizz. I'll definitely be returning ! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, new, and tasty place.",

    "text": "First time visit today. What a waste of a great neighborhood bar! We were met by the owner with smart comments about extra fees for seating the patio because they have to walk further to deliver food. Then with limited to chicken or turkey products for our omellets, nothing on menu of choices of what could be in the omelette, veggies, cheeses etc.. OH and they advertise \"free\" coffee friday, the owner who I presume would know about coffee deal charged us full price for two coffees. I then said I had seen on their web site it was free coffee friday. He muttered something under his breathe like \"you had to say that before we charge you\"? Hey 2 plain cups of unamazing coffee for $5.00.   Next he informed us that if we didn't finish all our food we would have to go in the back and do his dishes. He really isn't funny, nor are his smart comments.   Saved the best for last! Our food came out, there is nothing on tables like jellies, salt pepper etc. When a server brought our food out he asked if we needed anything else, I asked for salt & pepper. The owner over heard my request and grabbed shakers and came to our table with both but said we didn't need salt because \"his\" food is cooked to perfection. The server was behind this guy rolling his eyes in disbelief. I asked him to leave the salt anyway. The server stayed at our table explaining the owner was just joking. I told him I did not appreciate being told now how I like my food, and that this was our first time visiting their restaurant and our last.   I still have a bad after taste from the pan potatoes, and the \"turkey\" bacon was so thin it was hard to find or see and really was tasteless. The only thing that added favor to our eggs were onions and peppers. Some kinda toast, toasted in a panini press, dry, cold, no butter or jelly, perhaps from a county jail recipe book. I made good use of it though with my \"sad\" left on plate for them to find (with salt shaker).   Leaving was uneventful with no thank you, no come again, no nothing. So thought I would spare some from this \"overpriced\" place. We were going to go to IHOP wish we would have.   Like I said \"waste of a good neighborhood bar (fka Manhattan 's )",

Perfect eggs are hard to find but they're making amazing omelettes, great sunny side up's and awesome scrambled eggs here. The breads are always spectacular you won't find any pork bacon, but the turkey sausage and chicken sausage more than make up for it.  After trying breakfast I decided to check out their lunch and dinner menu and that was truly a revelation. The lamb chops are the best in town, the other meals are just as creative everything from a really well spiced burger to a ball of rice with ground beef in it. Both American and regional cuisine. Doing the cakes, pies, cookies, and other baked food justice just isn't possible without you trying. An incredible creative streak runs through the kitchen. Traditional cakes and cheesecakes, a Japanese style cheesecake perfect for summer (it is light and airy, a lemon meringue cheesecake that has to be seen and tried to be believed.  Apparently the coffee is really good too I don't drink coffee, but it is one of the only places in town where you can get a good Turkish coffee",

As a west African native familiar with french cuisine, I was quite impressed with everything I had for breakfast.The food presentation was awesome especially the fresh fruits served on a bed of lettuce. The scrambled eggs were excellent;the sauteed baby potatoes with a hint of olive oil, garlic and some mysterious herbs were to die for.I am usually very hard to please when it comes to crepes but the Mixed Berry are worth the dive, it was succulent. To finish, you can't call it a breakfast without a good coffee...I had a double shot espresso with room for plentiful cream and it was delucious. Service was good but could be better. I felt that I was more interested about the restaurant and the food than they were about me...maybe their way to give customers some privacy... Nevertheless, I will definitely go back, maybe with the family next time.",

They catered amazing food and even gluten free! Many of our congregation had not been there before and really enjoy the experience!  As the pastor I hadn't really had time to eat. But before I left, the owner found out and made sure that I got to try some of the gluten-free crepes with lemon curd, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream. It was so delicious that I ate the whole thing on the way home. Lol!  It's a beautiful restaurant with lots of comfortable and convenient seeding. And a private room that would hold 20. A private party of about 100 would be perfect there.",

They actually have a bell that you have to ring for someone to come out.  There was one night that I went in to order food and the man came out that works there and told me that he wasn't going to be able to help me for about 15 or 20 minutes the restaurant was completely empty by the way.  There was no apology not explanation.  Another time I called in a to go order and the man who answered the phone asked me to text my order.  I don't believe this is great customer service.  Everytime I have gone in there the restaurant is empty so now I know.  I have never called a place for a to go order and was asked to text my order.  I finally stopped going there.  If i call or go into a business I expect to get helped right away and if not there should have been a reason why he couldn't help me for 15-20 minutes.  They also use bag salad I think which they charge way to much for.  Speaking of salad they serve it with eggs???? When I order breakfast I don't want salad with it.  I won't go here again the service is terrible and they act like they are doing you a favor or like you are bothering them.  This place will not last with that kind of attitude.",

We now live in Ahwahtukee, and we have a neighborhood bakery that rivals Tartine!  No lines!  When the owner said their croissants were the best, I'm not going to lie. I was very skeptical.  The proof was in the tasting. The croissants are flaky and buttery, melting in the mouth. The almond croissant is a must buy! In addition to that flaky, buttery pastry, the frangipane is light and fluffy with a wonderful almond flavor. The spinach pastries were delicious as well, and the flavor the spinach was so yummy. We also had a cream puff, which was filled with a delicious, light cream. We plan on coming here often. The owners came out to greet us personally, making the whole experience wonderful.",

Both were good, but wow I am glad I listened to his suggestion for the turkey and pesto crepe! It was amazing. I would like to come back to try the dinner specials because it looks really reasonably priced and hopefully tastes as good as the breakfast.",

We had a butter croissant, almond croissant, spinach and cheese pastry, and a cream puff.  They were some of the best we've ever had, rivaling the best in San Francisco and NYC. We can't wait to come back.",

The countet is filled with all sorts of tarts, baklava, macaroons and pastry.  Okay, if you know me, you know I love my coffee.  Well the coffee is really good.  Self sevice for water is found around the corner from the counter. So I got the egg boat.  OMG soft dough with different types of cheese on top melted while the dough is cooking and than two eggs are on top cooked perfectly.  It was wonderful. Doug got the Greek egg sandwich.  Both came with a Greek salad. We both really enjoyed our breakfast and plan to come back for lunch and dinner.",

Not sure where to even start... We went in for breakfast, ordered some coffee and food. About 15 minutes went by before we had to ASK for our coffee. It was brought to us with no cream, sugar or spoon. Coffee was not hot and most definitely watered down. A very sad looking breakfast sandwhich followed, of course accompanied with no silverware, salt or pepper.   The Early Greek sandwhich which was supposed to be a veggie frittata on fresh baked bread was served to us as plain scrambled eggs on dry white wonder bread, toasted like a panini. My spinach pie, which I had to ask about just like the coffee was going to be a few extra minutes as they were \"cooking it fresh\". I was under the impression they forgot about it, but whatever. It was served to me moments later, still frozen.  My next concern... is this even a real bakery? Where are the free smells?! I think the Early Baker is a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffraud.com&s=e5311fe9a580399139725d9e80bcbeeda2ffa589c180933c035c11515f34d1ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fraud.com</a>  This place has a lot of potential but needs a serious management intervention. Their location is great and Ahwatukee is thirsty for more breakfast spots. On a Saturday morning, this place should be packed! Instead, the employees were running around frazzled with only just a couple of tables.   I gave it a go and can confidently say that there is no way I'll be giving this place a second chance. Good luck Early Baker. You can have the nicest looking restaurant around, but if your food and service sucks... chances are you won't be around for long.",

I liked it so much I had a gyro craving and came back for another one a few days later.  As I write this my mouth is watering...I'll be headed back to EarlyBaker today.",

    "text": "Tried Early Baker twice, won't be back.  First time - take out from bakery;  my croissant was dry, possibly stale.  OK, that can happen, so I thought I would try to eat in.  Second visit was early afternoon on a Sunday.  Breakfast sounded good, so I tried an egg sandwich.  Got the cheese and egg - the bread was VERY good and they customized the order the way I wanted (no swiss).  It was big for an egg sandwich, but it wasn't flavorful.  The potatoes might have been ok, but they were served barely luke warm (some were even cold), they could have used some more seasoning and I thought the serving was stingy (seriously, it's potatoes, they aren't expensive).  The side fruit salad was also small and half frozen.  There was no salt & pepper on the table (maybe they keep it with the drinks, I didn't check) which might have helped flavor of both the potatoes and the sandwich.  Service was prompt and the server did check in on me.  I am sure there are other great places for breakfast in the area, so I won't try this place a third time.",

    "text": "We came in with high expectation due to high reviews on yelp but were sadly disappointed. The food is generally over priced for the value. We paid $3 for a tiny americano that was not refillable. We ordered their egg boat special and the bread underneath the eggs seemed to be prefabbed and resembling a pillsbury day-old croissant with a similar texture. Next, the chicken Florentine crepe was fairly tasty but overly creamy; the chicken and mushrooms were simply slapped on to a pile of crepe (the contents were not wrapped inside the crepes). Finally, we ordered an almond croissant which was good but not sure if it's worth the $5. While they did reheat the croissant for us, the croissant was lukewarm and still cold inside.",

The coffee tasted watered down, the food was bland, the bread felt like something store bought versus freshly baked, and it took what felt like forever to come out once we ordered it. If we do go back, it may be to try the crepes. But that's an IF, for sure.",

We were enticed with their Lasagna, Linguini and Garlic Bread special for $7.99 and have returned for French Toast, Linguini with Baby Clams, a Ravioli and Shrimp dish, another Lasagna, Tiramisu, and Japanese Cheese Cake. Everything has been delicious and of the highest quality and the owners, Adam and Kinana, have treated us like family. They truly pour their heart and soul into their restaurant/bakery. My only regret is that I didn't stop in to this local gem sooner. Highly recommended!!",

And homemade vanilla syrup to put in it (or drink...whatever you decide ;). The owners are fabulous! They make everything from scratch and OMG is it delicious. We had the eggs on a boat, brioche French toast, and a chocolate croissant....um YUM!   We quite possibly might go back for breakfast everyday while we are here!",

Just enough food to constitute a reasonable serving and filling. The salad was fresh and the gyro meat which they said they made in house was delicious. We have tried some of the desserts as well and the cinnamon roll was delicious as was the Napoleon. The baklava had a delicious flavor with honey reminiscent of lavender.   The owners are very friendly and the ambience is nice with both indoor and outdoor eating areas. I think they might need to lower prices a bit or amp up the advertising because it hasn't been very busy when I've gone. I hope others in Tukee will come out to support local business because this place has a lot going for it.",

It's nothing a little seasoning, maybe a little salt and pepper, couldn't help but it needs something. We all had eggs, I had a frittata, and e everyone found their breakfast to be bland. The man at the counter was delightful and personable and made sure we had everything we needed. I hope they figure everything out and stay in business because it's a cute little place.",

They don't just make food they make spices rather than buying pre-ground stuff. For butter they use the Irish butter.  I got an egg boat and a croissant . It was all stunning. There is a lot of butter in the croissant and I don't know if they have one that might appeal a bit more to those watching their waistline. But if an occasional splurge on a Rich croissant is OK boy these are the best anywhere.",
