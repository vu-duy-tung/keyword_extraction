My friend and I ordered a bunch of dishes to share and we could not pinpoint a favorite because they were all pretty mediocre.  The biggest laugh of it all?  The sticky rice.  It's $2 and it comes in this wicker type of basket thing.  When I pulled it out, it was wrapped in saran wrap.  And it was literally just a ball of rice.  My friend giggled as she said it looked like I was holding up a used condom.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry to be so harsh, but that is such a rip off.  It wasn't even sweet.  In my mind, when you order sticky rice, if it doesn't come with sliced mangoes, it should at least be covered with coconut milk.  Not just a ball of rice wrapped in saran wrap.  I cannot say I will be back but I can at least cross this one off my list of places to visit.",

The staff was very friendly and attentive. We didn't wait long for anything. The bartender was charming and he happily described the flavors in their unique specialty cocktails, making it easier to pick one. The food was delicious and different than what you find at most Thai restaurants in Phoenix. Everything was unbelievably light and flavorful! I can't say enough good things about Glai Baan. It was really great! I can't wait to go back!!",

Everyone working was super friendly and helpful with questions.  Ordered the pad thai with extra veggies - perfect balance of the sweet and spicy (I asked for extra hot) noodles were perfectly cooked and the veggies were fresh and delicious.  Pad Kee Mao (sub'd tofu instead of pork)  also got extra spicy - this was soo freaking good.  Loved all the veggies and the flavor. Also got the salted crab papaya salad - this was interesting and flavorful. Only disappointment there was no crab except one really small claw... maybe its just for flavor not actual meat but was a little bummed with the baby claw :(  Overall was very impressed with this new little local spot and will be back very soon - probably next week.",

The flavor was just like I remembered, and I was full enough to take home leftovers. I wasn't sure about the pickles, but they were a nice compliment.   The restaurant's ambiance was pleasant and perfect for a date night. I went on a Saturday at 7pm, and for a group of two, we had about a 10 min wait. Call ahead if bringing a large group as the space is limited (in fact my chair was bumped several times by people trying to get thru.)   I'll be back soon to explore more of the menu.",

    "text": "This is THAI FOOD.   If you have Thai friends, and you eat with them a lot, they will fill you in on certain things. Such as, when eating Thai food, you typically use a spoon in the dominant hand, (fork in the other) and chopsticks are most often reserved for noodles. You may have also heard that Pad Thai, the dish everyone in the west thinks of as the quintessential Thai dish, is actually not very prolific in Thailand, and Thai folks are notoriously picky about the execution of this dish. In short, if you always order Pad Thai at Thai restaurants, you're doing it wrong.   However, at Glai Baan it's a different story. Pad Thai here is True Pad Thai. It's not overly oily, or sweet. It comes with lime to squeeze over it. The right kind of chives are used, and the flavors are subtle whilst still bold.   A highlight for me was the som tum (papaya salad) is also offered in the extra spicy rendition that features fermented crab legs. A dish like this is typically reserved for Thai customers, as a lot of folks find the ultra pungence of the crab to be off-putting. However, if you know this flavor and are sure you love it - you will not be disappointed here. This is hard to find!!!   Though all the dishes are faithful to authenticity whilst also showing a bit of tasteful creative attitude, the Nam tok was executed in a way that really elevated the dish. Aside from the perfectly toasted rice granules and rare beef, a sprinkling of micro fennel adds the perfect touch to this dish - and now I feel I must learn to grow this microgreen at home in order to enjoy nam tok properly. It's that good.   We sampled more than half of the menu, and tried various wines and beers throughout the meal. Thai food pairs best with cocktails, crisp white wines or wheat beer, and these are well represented at the bar. Personally, I tend toward rich reds when eating Thai, and the Cotes du Rhone blend served my palate well.   At the end of the meal we were surprised to discover that a favorite, and very hard-to-find in the states Thai dessert was available: pandan cream with soft bread, of which I cannot remember the Thai name. If you are unfamiliar with pandan, think of it as a subtle/quiet flavor for sweets. In the west, this might be akin to vanilla, but a bit more subtle. Whatever it is, I cannot get enough of it, and it is used in a wide variety of Thai desserts. At Glai Baan, they use a soft, thick bread similar to texas toast but more luxurious if that makes sense, and it is dipped in a custard cream imbibed with the soft, green goodness that is pandan. The sticky rice and mango dessert is mandatory, as you know - and it is also done to perfection, a faint flavoring of pandan is present in this as well.   As mentioned in several reviews, the ambiance here is soft, comfortable, yet not overly-dim. I'd feel most comfortable wearing something like beach-formal attire here, and I'll wait as long as needed in order to sit outside with the ficus trees and the strings of lights glowing softly in the branches. Magical, it is.   Really though, to our party who dined here last night, this place is the best. The menu is devoid of pretense, and based on the non-designed styling of the content of this menu that even I, as a graphic designer adore for several reasons, is updated as the offerings change. It would be a good idea to come often if one lived in Phoenix, as this environment, the staff and the plates they set before you are uplifting and inspiring.   I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix. Arroy mak, krab!",

Alas, now you will know my deep secret, for this Thai food place is your next date night bistro, friend catch up scene, or place to take out of town diners.  Tucked away on Osborn and 24th, this itty bitty restaurant is cozy, romantic, dimly lit, and the setting for homecooked Thai food. We ordered three starters: steamed pork dumplings, papaya salad with crispy pork belly, and pork skewers in coconut milk and garlic - really, are you salivating yet? As mentioned before, everything tasted homecooked, and delicious. The steamed pork dumplings were made with love while the pork skewers were plump and tender. The papya salad was not far behind with fresh, crisp vegetables and yummy pork belly. For the entree, I ordered the Kapro Gai Kai Dao, or the minced chicken with onion, garlic, chili, Thai basil, egg, and rice. It sounds like a simple dish but this was jam-packed with flavor and complexity. It was one of the best Thai entrees I've had in a long time! Finally, I also ordered The Anywhere Door for my choice of beverage, which had Thai tea with rum. The flavors surprisingly went very smoothly together, and I sipped on it fairly quickly, so it was gone before I knew it. Do yourself a favor and treat 'yo self to Glai Baan. If you're a Thai food fan or foodie, you definitely won't regret it!",

Flavors were amazing and not overwhelming. Spiciness in medium was perfect. I usually add spices to my food, I enjoyed the dishes as they came. The special red curry with beef was delicious, a bit on the sweet side if you like that. And the noodles had enough flavor mixed with the beef that was cooked to perfection and which was a good cut of beef. Overall one of the best experiences of Thai food I had in Phoenix. The patio is just beautiful and November is perfect time to enjoy outdoors. If it gets cold, there are space heaters? :)",

The place is pretty cute inside with a lot of cool photographs of Thailand and kitschy Thai art. But the food is AMAZING. We ordered the muscles as an appetizer that came in a sauce so good we were spooning in into our mouths! We also ordered a fried oyster mushroom app that was on special which was really light and flavorful.  For my meal, i ordered one of the nightly special which was a thin glass noodle with fermented tofu. It was full of all my favorite Thai flavors! My first bite i looked up and said \"oh yeah, i made the right decision.\" I was too busy eating my meal to taste anyone else's, but everyone enjoyed their entrees.",

First off the ambiance is very cozy, tastefully decorated, the dining area and bar are quite quaint and has a welcoming vibe. We started off at the bar since there was a wait for a table and had a hard time deciding which cocktail to try as they all sounded very interesting. I went with the Laab Sided which was a liquid cocktail version of laab and my husband had the Anywhere Door which was an alcoholic version of a Thai tea. How the bartender was able to get the flavors of laab into liquid form was very intriguing to me and I had to pick his brain on the recipe. He enthusiastically spoke to me about the process of inventing this sweet yet savory drink which is a must try.  Our table was ready, the menu had a lot of fantastic looking dishes. We of course had to try the Khao soi as it was my favorite dish that I had in Chiang Mai and is also one that I learned to cook at a cooking class there. Our server helped us with the rest of our choices, the pork dumplings and the special of mackerel fried rice. The dumplings were wonderful, you could tell how fresh they were. The Khao soi met my expectations, and tasted spot on with the ones that I had eaten in Thailand and the mackerel fried rice was to die for. Portion sizes were large and we were full about 3/4's of the way through, but it was one of those meals you couldn't let go to waste so we licked our plates clean even though we were stuffed!   Service was warm and welcoming from the front of the house, to the bartender and our waitress. All were very knowledgeable and willing to describe the dishes/cocktails to help make choices. Overall it was a well rounded fantastic experience, one of those places you will just want to eat your way through the menu. The hype is definitely deserved!",

Well this time we made it (on a Wed). Went early (6pm) and got right in with no wait but there was a long wait when we were leaving FYI. We just ordered a bunch of small plates. 3 was not enough for 2 hungry people. The first 3 dishes were incredible! Why haven't we been coming here every night??? Space is really cozy. If I had to say to try one thing, it would be the mussels. That sauce was layered and surprising. We also had New York strip and steamed pork dumplings. Yum! We ordered another 3 for good measure but were underwhelmed by the second course. Crab papaya salad - couldn't figure out how to eat, only had tiny hard crab shells (was I supposed to crack those to suckers to get crab?). Additionally, was so spicy  , it burnt my tongue (and I like spicy), couldn't eat, which made me sad. Then the chicken wings were pretty flavorless and had too much breading. We ended with pork skewers which were really good! The restaurant was super sweet and offered a delicious birthday dessert, which was a pistachio custard and sweet bread for dipping. Over all it was really fun to try this place and I will definitely return. Seriously, be adventurous and try the mussels!",

With an emphasis on \"street food\", they specialize in spicy small plates you won't see much of anywhere else. And...well, noodles. But unlike the million 'tapas' places popping up, it likes to be warm and cozy. Not flashy at all. Water served slightly cool in tiny tin cups. Food on flimsy plates. No ambient lights or DJs or anything. It is humble, but I don't think it needs all the bells and whistles of trendier competition to be successful.  I am really not much of a noodle person, but I gave the pad kee mao a try and was not disappointed. Think Pad Thai, but with pork. Included with the plate was a large serving of uncut green onions, bean sprouts, and dry spices (salt, peanuts, and chili flakes) as opposed to the array of sauces I'm accustomed to for this cuisine. They will warn you about spice, which I love because I'm tired of your sensitive palates ruining it for the rest of us.  I paired this with an innovative selection from their limited cocktail list: The Thai Hive (Jasmine Gin, Chili Honey, lemon juice, fish sauce) sounds stomach-turning but is refreshing, tart, and packs a wallop. Other drinks feature baiju, black vinegar, or even shallots and toasted rice.   This is the innovation we NEED in the local dining scene, all at reasonable portions and price points. I'm already excited to return!",

The Panang Curry is always good and don't miss the dessert with fresh baked bread.  The only thing I didn't love was the Mackerel Fried Rice, but everything else we've had has been very good.

We ordered Kanom Jeeb (steamed pork dumplings with scallion ginger soy sauce), Silom Road Moo Ping (Pork skewers with garlic Jaew sauce), Son-in-Law Eggs (fried soft-boiled eggs topped with fried shallots served with sweet, salty and sour sauce), Penang Curry (braised beef, roasted pepper, bamboo shoot, and Thai basil) and Pan Fried Glass Noodles with Shrimp and Pork Belly. Everything was delicious! The taste of the Penang Curry reminded me so much of Indonesian's famous dish: Beef Rendang. If Sriracha or dried chili powder are not extra hot enough for you, you can ask for chopped Thai bird chilies. Max, our server was awesome also. Too bad they don't open for lunch. Will definitely want to go back here again and try something else.",

This place is a family home flipped into a restaurant. My friend is a regular here so we were greeted with big smiles and the hosts, servers, and bartenders all introduced themselves to me. It was a very nice personal touch. The host was super communicative and updated us constantly on how long our wait would be for a table. Service was superb! We ordered the panang curry and also shrimp pad Thai as well as a bottle of wine. I wish I was more hungry so I could've eaten a full meal here but even the little that we had I enjoyed it. I'll definitely come back again!",

He recommended some amazing dishes that we were so happy to try. We just got back from Thailand two weeks ago and I have to say, everything at Glai Baan tasted so authentic! The glass noodle dish tasted as if I just bought it from a street vendor in Chiang Mai. My absolute favorite was definitely the green curry noodle, they only had it on special that night so I'm not sure you'll be lucky enough to taste that one. I also had the mackerel fried rice which was full of flavor. The ambiance was perfect, as if you were on a Bangkok street late night surrounded by tons of people at the night market! 10/10 recommend",

    "text": "Glai Baan currently operates out of the building that previously housed Mejico Cocina Mejicana, a pretty decent Mexican eatery that I was sad to see close its doors earlier this year. Their specialty is what they refer to as \"Thai Street Food,\" which appears to a combination of the traditional Thai dishes you're familiar with, combined with items that only hardcore fans of the food will probably recognize. It's an interesting concept that already appears to be generating a bit of a buzz on the social media circuit, although I'm still not sure what falls under the \"street food\" umbrella.  My girlfriend and I stopped by on a Saturday night and unexpectedly found the place to be pretty crowded. I've always liked the setup of the restaurant, with a nice, outdoor patio that's closed off with a wood-fence, giving the place sort of a \"backyard\" feel to it.   As usual, we ordered a couple of Thai teas. They offer an alcoholic variation on the drink, but we prefer keeping things basic. Their Thai tea is different in the sense that, it wasn't really sweet and did not have that ultra-mliky flavor that we've become accustomed to. This might make it different, but didn't necessarily make it better, in my opinion. We both agreed that we prefer the way it's usually prepared at other places - which is also cheaper than the four dollar asking price. But that's just personal preference, I guess.  For food, we started off with the silom road moo, which are basically pork skewers that were great quality and included a bit of very mildly spicy sauce for dipping. Additionally, we chose a dish that I cannot find on the most recently posted menu. It combined noodles with shrimp and a few other additions, one of which, had a very strange smell and acidic \"bite\" to it. My girlfriend liked it a bit more than I did. The smell reminded me of things I'd rather not mention in the review.  For main dishes, it was a rather tricky process. My girlfriend generally dislikes spicy food, while I can handle almost anything - or so I thought. Her options were very limited, since the majority of the items are noted as being spicy. She chose the ka na moo grob, which included stir fried broccoli, pork belly, rice, and what is referred to as a \"son in law\" egg. I went for the pad kee mao, which included a boatload of ingredients, including pork belly, broccoli, mushrooms, bamboo shoot, rice, egg, and both some chili and garlic.  Okay, so I'll openly admit that everything was very good quality. But as one of the other reviewers noted, the dishes are just so-damned-spicy! They don't do scales here, but my dish clearly hovered in the level 4-5 that you'd find at most traditional Thai restaurants. After a couple of bites, I could not really appreciate the food's quality, because the chili flakes completely dominated the entire dish.  My girlfriend's dish, on the other hand, was not listed as being spicy, but still was to the point where she had difficulty eating it. Chili flakes were still very much present. While it was definitely less harsh than mine, it was still spicy enough that the server should have inquired about her tolerance level. Once again, I'll state that the dish itself was very good quality, but after a few bites, it became very difficult to appreciate. I'm convinced that they actually overdid hers on accident.  We both quickly developed runny noses and watery eyes as a result, while listening to a table full of twenty-somethings that were situated way too close to our table, huffing and puffing through each bite for the same reason. Clearly, my spice tolerance isn't as high as I had originally assumed, as it took a good twelve hours before my body felt \"normal\" again after the spice wreaked total havoc on my digestive tract.   For dessert, they offer some steamed bread that's served with a dipping custard, which wasn't available. Instead, we opted for this alternative special, which included a slice of pumpkin that had some hardened custard inside, served with condensed milk. It was okay, but would have preferred to try their primary offering. Oh well.  Ultimately, while the food is good quality and will probably please a lot of people, I just can't bring myself to give the place more than two stars. I'm sure I'll receive death threats as a result. For the price we paid, we didn't really get a lot of food - and what little we did take with us, neither one of us will probably eat. Currently, this place is receiving glowingly positive reviews, but without an established spice-level system, I'd suggest being very careful about what you order unless you have a stomach made out of iron.  I'd recommend them, because I feel it's a place that everyone should at least try once. The environment is nice, although they only get partial credit - as this building had a nice vibe long before they occupied the space. But for us, personally, I think we'll stick to some of our established favorites.",

Papaya salad with crab is awesome, and it is not catered towards a western palate.  Be adventurous, embrace the funk and you'll have a great meal.  Truly a gem for Phoenix.",

    "text": "Came here last weekend with some friends. We had a group of 5 total. We were told it would be about an hour wait as they only had 3-4 tables which could accommodate this group size. Okay, we had heard good things and were willing to wait. Someone in our party pointed out a few minutes later that there was a table outside that was available for a larger group and wondered if that was ours. After waiting for a few more minutes without them getting us for that empty table, we just assumed they were waiting to seat our group inside, which was totally fine with us as it was a colder evening. However, after waiting for over an hour we inquired as to how much longer it would be and were told we would be seated next. They cleared out a table inside and we assumed it would be ours since we were next. However, they seated ANOTHER group at that table! We again inquired as to why we weren't seated yet and they realized there had been a mix-up. A few minutes later, we were seated at the table outside.....WHICH HAD BEEN EMPTY THE ENTIRE HOUR+ THAT WE HAD WAITED!!!!! Our group ordered immediately hoping our food would come out quickly. It did not. The food then took another hour until it came out and every. single. person's. dish came out separately with at least 5-10 minutes in between. So it was either sit there and wait another 50 minutes for everyone's dish to come out and let your food get cold, or eat individually as the others sat and stared. After these insanely long waits for our (empty) table and food, we expected the food to be amazing and were sorely disappointed to realize it was just okay. I would definitely not recommend coming to this place unless you don't mind waiting an insane amount of time for everything unnecessarily.",

We also had a special: panang curry with beef ribs. It was really tasty and complex.  The building is lovely and has a garden with outdoor seating, too. Prices are reasonable for the quality.  They're still working out the kinks with some service stuff (they've only been open for nine days), but everyone was super friendly.",

    "text": "I made my return visit, as promised. Much better this time! A friend and I got the dumplings (which were strangely not as good as the first time, but still good), son in law eggs (so savory and delish), the ground chicken and rice dish with the fried egg, and the pad kee Mao (this time with crispy pork belly, which wasn't an option last time, but cost an additional 1$). The entrees were super good. The pad kee Mao was so much better this time..... I asked for spicy (again) but this time they made it SPICY !  The heat was perfectly balanced with basil leaves and did not overtake the flavor of the dish while still making my nose run. It was, unfortunately, way too spicy for my buddy, but, hey.... If you ask for spicy, can't complain about the heat. The crispy pork belly was so much better than the original.... It cut down on that weird gelatinous texture you can get from pork belly and left you with crispy, yet tender pieces of meat. The ground chicken dish was also a winner.... It was super savory with a touch of sweetness.... The egg was fried crispy on the bottom and still slightly runny on the top.... It was awesome. Additionally, the leftovers were fabulous! The only down sides I can see are A) the inconsistency.... Last time was not so good.... This time was great and B) the price..... Their prices are kinda outrageous. A plate of noodles in Phoenix should probably not cost 15$. I understand they cannot charge Thai prices (in Thailand, I got plates of noodles for 1$), but this isn't new york city either. I spent 30$ for dinner, which is a bit high for Thai food. Anyway, will the price keep me from coming back? No.... But I definitely won't come as often as I would if plates were closer to the 10-12$ range.",

Don't let that detract you from going, though. The food we tried from the somewhat limited menu was pretty good. I'd stop short of calling it our new go to Thai due to the lack of some staple items such as yellow and green curry. I'd say it felt more like a gourmet fusion influenced by Thai.

    "text": "Authentic thai food!! I was surprised and delighted! The ambiance was a nice casual with indoor and outdoor seating available. Very clean. It was packed for a Wednesday night as well! Service was great-- friendly and informative staff who seem to really enjoy their work.   The foooood: we tried several dishes. The food here was authentic and not \"americanized,\" even down to the use of asian long beans rather than american green beans. I felt transported to Bangkok and I could envision the seasoned older ladies cooking there. Everything was fresh and flavors were well-balanced. The spiciness level is True to asian spice levels.   I LOVED the mackerel fried rice. So much umami flavoring!! The drunken noodles were also very different from other places I've been to. These noodles were not overly saturated with soy sauce and had a cleaner taste. The fried chicken appetizer was delic. Larb moo was right on. The one thing i wish could have been done differently was that the cabbage could have been chopped and easier to eat. Same thing with the cabbage served with the salted crab papaya salad. Also, we were warned about the crab being different from most people's expectations, but it was still surprising to get a papaya salad with tiiiiiny bits of shelled crab nevertheless. I couldn't eat the crab because it was impossible to get the meat out, but I did try to suck out the juice which was good. I might just get a normal papaya salad next time. The flavors were excellent.   We also had the pandan custard dessert. I could see real bits of pandan leaf, so they certainly don't use artificial flavoring--and the flavor is consistent with use of fresh ingredients! The custard kept cooking in the steaming basket, so toward the end the custard curdled. However, I don't think anyone would notice if they weren't really into baking and cooking. This dessert reminded me of a famous custard/toast restaurant in bangkok. I was happy to be reminded :)  Overall, excellent thai food. It's hard to actually judge thai food bc so many places produce the same flavors. However, this place was different enough for me to write a yelp review. If you don't really know your thai food, maybe you wouldn't notice the difference, but I certainly appreciate the subtleties. I would definitely return :)",

Then we had the chicken wings, larb, and papaya salad. All very well done no big standout but all very nice. For entrees we had prik king, ka na mo grab, and Panang Curry. They were all great but I though the Panang curry was the star of the entrees. All in all a great Thai dinner. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Glai Baan has been somewhere I've passed on many occasions, but following a trusted friends recommendation, I stopped in for a light snacks.  The place is quaint, formerly a failed Mexican restaurant which seemed to have come and gone in a matter of weeks, I am please to find the place vibrant at 10:15pm, a spattering of people at the bar and dotted around sparsely at tables, inside and out.  Staff were a little 'more' attentive than necessary, but by no means annoying, lets just say on the keen side, which is a plus compared to many.  I chose the wings and the NY Strip salad, which I had been considering since looking at the menu online. It really was tasty and filling, despite the apparently small serving. The 'Micro greens' which accompanied the steak was actually more of a subtle camouflage for the unexpectedly generous amount of beef beneath. The chicken wings were indeed crispy and very pleasantly seasoned, an interesting tamerind based dip accompanying.  I've no doubt more substantial food is great too.   I highly recommend the place. I hope you enjoy as much as I did.",

There is most likely going to be a wait since it's small too. I wouldn't suggest for a large group. I would cap it at 4 people at most, and that's if you're willing to sit outside. But, I find that it is worth the wait. Servers are super nice. My friend and I were seated at the bar, and they were great at giving recommendations and telling about the specials. I got the jungle curry (special) and my friend got the tom yum. Very flavorful, and not terribly expensive! You'll probably look at $13-16 depending on the entree. If you like alcohol, their drinks look super awesome. My friend grabbed one, and we said we were going to share it just to try. Bartender was kind enough to separate them into glasses for us too! (We didn't even ask!) Since we were at the bar, we could tell the bartender really was meticulous about his work!",

However, we were able to snag seats to order dinner from the Bar.  I studied Yelp for suggestions and looked at friends photos to determine some of the better plates to order. We decided on a bunch of small plates to share and proceeded to order 5 dishes.  We settled on the Salted Crab & Papaya salad- which is a staple. We also tried the pork Dumplings, which were delicious. Last, we ordered a dish of minced pork and the Son-in-law eggs (deep fried soft boiled eggs).   From the nightly special we ordered raw shrimp (side note- I dont think I've ever had raw uncooked shrimp- the sauce accompanied it was delicious). Also had the crispy beef ribs- which were more to nibble on.  Lastly, desert was a traditional Thai street food desert of sweet bread and a very sweet cream to dip it in. It was light and airy and delicious! Can't wait to come back in and order the other 1/2 is the menu we didn't get to yet!",

Maxwell who has been at this location since day 1 is so knowledgeable and very upbeat and pleasant. He guided up through the menu. Starting with the pork dumplings are such a treat that i am still dreaming about them, we followed that with a papaya salad which was interesting but delicious followed by a bowl that was rice, diced chicken and topped with a fried egg this is plenty  for a party of two share.  Make sure to make reservations if you have a party over 2 and make sure to ask questions.  Thank you Maxwell we look forward to seeing you soon and working our way around the menu.  Enjoy!!!",

There's around 10 tables or so inside so it is very snug, however the food is hands down the best Thai food I've had in AZ! I had the red curry which was mildly spicy and the dumplings which were both to die for.  Service was friendly and very time efficient. I noticed our server was one of few, and he was bouncing from table to table. But our food came out relatively fast and he kept asking us if we needed anything. The server also informed us they have one person in the back who is the only cook and they do everything! That made my level of appreciation sky rocket! They were pretty busy on a weekend with limited parking and places to wait, but I promise the food is worth it 100%! The dumplings were divine and perfect to simply put it. The texture and taste were on point. And the curry was full of flavor with the chicken being a very good quality. Also cooked to perfection.",

    "text": "Glai Baan easily the best Thai restaurant in all of Phoenix.   This adorably delicious restaurant exceeded all expectations. What we have here my friends is a serious contender perhaps for a James Beard award for some of the best Thai food in the USA. I do not exaggerate.   Yes, the street food themed menu is somewhat limited, but of what I tested every single dish is probably five stars or even higher.   I don't claim to be an expert at Thai food but I do enjoy it as often as possible.   My favorite Thai destination is \"Lotus of Siam\" in Vegas which for me is the standard by which I compare the rest. I went here late last night for the first time late (by myself) and I can say that *every single dish* that I ordered including the steamed pork dumplings were absolutely off the charts scrumptious.   The noodle and meat dish that I ordered (Pad Kee Mao) was ordered three stars in terms of the heat (they use a 4 star heat system), and I can tell you that the dish was perfectly quite spicy (as a matter fact hotter than I can usually handle), but I absolutely loved it - as the tastes were so incredibly good that the heat was a party in my mouth. Perfect to wash down with my Singh ha beer.   But It's not just the tastes here that are amazing, it's also the *textures* if that makes sense. Every dish had a depth of complexity to it with unexpected flavor notes even for someone like me that loves Thai food. The wide noodles had a good al dente bite to them, not soggy or over-cooked. And the unexpected pleasures were not just the flavors but as I said the textures - which for me was surprising. Crunches here. Soft bites there. Savory here. Sweet there. Wow.   The service was also exceptional and Dan the owner (who stopped by to chat) was passionate, caring and you could tell that he really took not only the food seriously... but every customer was the focus...making sure things were smooth and that the food was to your liking.   I will be returning very soon!   We are so lucky to have an incredible restaurant like this locally. The vibe is adorable, very cool and kind of Bohemian.    I just love this place. Winner.",

    "text": "This place just opened around the corner from my house, so naturally I was excited to try it. Ordered pad Thai and crab fried rice to go. Was asked on the phone my spice level and ordered as mild as possible. Food was pretty pricy and portions VERY small. A hungry man would need to order two entrees to be satisfied. The flavor was good and food was enjoyable, however it was SO spicy. The food was visibly coated in lots of red pepper flakes. My lips haven't stopped burning and my nose was running the whole time. Having ordered mild, it was so spicy it wasn't enjoyable after a few bites...which is good because you only get a few bites. 2 stars solely for flavor. Bigger portions or more reasonable prices and accuracy of \"mild\" would make this review a 5.",

Once our dumplings arrived we moved to the patio.  I asked if they could turn 'up' the music as the dead space could have been filled with some relaxing tunes.  We ordered the spicy papaya salad, a noodle and rice dish...all delicious!!! Food came out quickly, service fairly attentive, and overall we are hooked on the dumplings...back next time for those and perhaps soup!!",

If your exposure to thai is mostly pad Thai do yourself a favor and try the less familiar dishes they serve (Also the pad Thai there is great )",

    "text": "Have you ever seen a person that's almost a 10 in real life, and then boom, their personality came out and its so bad that it knocks them down to at best a 2? That's Glai Baan. Don't get me wrong, the food was tasty, the hipster vibe was dope. The hidden gem of a place was what we all expected except the management... nooooo.   Our reservation was made 2 weeks ago for a party of 7. Since a few of us busy mommas were tricking in after work and whatnot we knew that arriving early and managing the reservation would be left to one dear friend at 7pm sharp to get things going. Having her arrive early we had her order family style appetizers, entrees and plenty of wine for when we all trickled in between 7:00-7:20pm all of us seated and drinking and eating shortly afterwards by 7pm. The \"manager\" who was also the host gave her a harrrrrdd time.. he kept saying he would rather not seat us until our entire party arrived. We thought that seemed odd if we were preordering food, so we asked him why.... his response: He said that he would rather give our table to someone else that walked in or split it in two vs. letting us order the food in advance in case they were able to flip a table or two in-between. Maybe someone can enlighten me if they are in the FB industry as to why this is an issue, if you are please feel free to educate me on why this should even be talked about to a guest. Also, what guarantees that these people would want to leave in order for us to be seated once everyone arrived? Anyhow, we weren't understanding the problem. Food and wine were being ordered and our party would simply sit down and start to eat and chat. The manager said, \"Well if you promise to leave by 9pm as we have another reservation after yours, we can seat you now\"? Huh. Okay... We promise. Whhhhhaaaa????  Our actual server was great educated on the menu, kind, and made fabulous suggestions. But we couldn't help but feel that \"weird feeling\" like we weren't wanted... Anyhow, long story short, The owner happened to stop by our table randomly to ask if there was anything we needed, and there was, we ordered another round of wine bottles for the table, cocktails, a couple of side sauces and another round of family style entrees, because he asked and we were having a nice time catching up. He couldn't have been more rude... or awkward maybe? He said... My name is Everette, I don't respond to being called over, snapped at or talked to across the way just so you know... and this is the only time I will be stopping by your table so if you want something order it now because I'm not coming back and its not even my job its your servers I was just stopping by to see if there was anything you needed.... um what?. We didn't know what he was talking about and thought that he was some awkward person that maybe hasn't ever really talked to a group of women before and figured he just needed something to say. So we kept the wine and convo's going catching up with each other over yummy food and kind of blew it off. Anyway, he wasn't going to ruin our night some of us mums hadn't seen each other all year so Everett and his issues with women weren't the first things on our minds.   Then 9pm hit.... Dun Dun Dunnnn..... The server dropped the check we all paid, and you guessed it, Everett came by. After we signed our ticket he started reaching across grabbing our half empty wine glasses and plates with bites of food on them still yet to be savored. Not grabbing from the side reaching his chubby flanneled arm over our faces and grabbing the dishes away on a dirty servers tray. So at that time we left. And here we are Yelp. Yelp is so cool for crap exactly like this.   Too bad. Glia Bann is like a hot pop star with a diva attitude, that eventually not one can stand... except for maybe a one night food stand, but poor Glia is not someone you take home to meet your parents, or take your loved ones to enjoy. You can get great tasting thai food with amazing hospitably elsewhere. Not a long term thing here... unless that's your thing.",

It's a small place so don't be surprised if you have to wait -- I promise it's worth it. I had to Melon Fizz drink and it was very refreshing. Next up was the pork dumplings and my god, I could've had 3 orders of those. They are seriously addicting! Our server, Everett, was incredibly accommodating and suggested a few options, including the Panang Curry. WOW. I could've swam in that sauce it was so freaking good. It's spicy and has overall delicious flavor. I seriously can't wait to go back.",

We chose to sit outside on the patio. I can see how parking could be a problem on busy nights. The place next door on 24th street is presently vacant and we actually parked there because it was easier to access. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. Staff is very friendly.  We generally order beer when we are out, and although they have a impressive drink and wine menu, their beer list is rather short. They did have a couple of local brews however, and we found one we liked, Huss Copper State IPA . Drinks run in the $10 range and the beers were $5. I believe the beers are from cans or bottles as it appeared to be a 12 oz pour in our pint glasses. We normally split at Thai restaurants due to large portions, so we ordered the Kanom jeeb from the small plate menu ( pork dumplings ) and the Kapro gai kai dao from the large plate menu. Both were delicious! The dumplings were on the mild side, spicey heat wise. The Kapro provided much more heat, but not so much as to interfere with the awesome combination of spices. Our entree was definitely on the small side portion wise, but so delicious. It was enough for the 2 of us in combination with the dumplings.",

I ordered the kao soi and I thought it was perfectly spiced and very creamy. The curry flavor wasn't over powering but you do have to like curry to enjoy this dish. The noodles were really nicely cooked and I enjoyed the chicken even though I'm usually not a fan of it. They will NOT customize anything on the menu. My friend is a vegan and she asked for tofu and no egg for her noodle dish. The server made a pretty big deal about it and was rude in the process. He then kept trying to get her to eat things with animal products. He said he would only customize for food allergies and eventually said he would make her the noodles with tofu and no egg. Then the noodles came out with egg in it. They were delicious but the service is pretty lacking. I understand not being able to customize orders but to say you'll do it and then bring the food out with egg in it is annoying. He wasn't very friendly about it either. Parking is scarce and if you sit inside it's pretty loud. The outdoor seating is cute but it's getting hotter outside so it won't be enjoyable for too much longer. I would recommend trying this place.",

Our favorites are crab fried rice, mackerel fried rice, beef short rib curry, steamed dumplings. The noodles dishes are consistent and delicious too. We have eaten in the restaurant--which is a small but charming place--and gotten take out. Service is great and food is impressive!",

Everett may have been the most informative waiter we've ever had, he walked us through drinks, tapas, and entree options and broken it down to best seafood option, vegan option, and meat options. He also recommended a few non-menu items: fyi the oyster mushrooms were absolutely mind blowing. The mussels were another stellar recommendation and he even brought out a steaming bowl of white rice when we were 80% done so that we could soak up the delicious broth - how awesome is that! I thoroughly enjoyed the glass noodles as well; they were perfectly flavored and didn't have an overly oily sauce. Our split entree was the pad kee mao with shrimp. The shrimp were big and plump and delicious! I highly recommend pairing your dishes with the yuzu beer and old-fashioned cocktail. We'll be back!",

    "text": "I enjoyed dinner at Glai Baan twice within a week or so, it's that good. I love seeing new and creative restaurants opening in the valley.  Glad Baan offers a unique take on Thai food that's totally new to Phoenix. Their menu is super shareable, and I am obsessed with all of their apps. The fried chicken wings are incredible, and we also loved the mussels. All of their sauces are fresh and packed with flavor.  So far, I've tried the wings, dumplings, mussels, Kao Soi, Pad Thai, and Pad Kee Mao.  Their Pad Thai is amazing. There's no other way to put it. The flavor is so rich, and so fresh. You can tell that every single dish is made with a lot of care and attention. The Kao Soi is like a curry soup that we all really enjoyed. The Pad Kee Mao was a favorite for some of our group, and fell flat for others.  Overall, definitely come here open-minded. If you're vegetarian, ask what they can do - we went the 2nd time with vegetarian friends, and the kitchen had a few specials for them.  Otherwise, try the wings, mussels, and pad thai - to start. Or just order one of everything  Their menu will continuously change, so if you love something, order it while you can!  Also, the staff was great. Dan (the owner) really cares about his patrons, and it shows.",

This time we opted to come a little early (yeah before they open) as the last time we were here we waited for a table for 40 min (which is still worth the wait so don't let that ever stop you from coming here). The kitchen we were told was ran by the grandma or at least some of her recipes they are whipping up.  Because we were the first in line (really only come 15 min early) we chose to sit at the bar where Max the tender was not only well versed on the menu, all of the cocktails on the menu were created by him. I am not a huge sweet drink guy but he made me something with a splash of coke served with pork rinds and a jalapeno (on the side - see pic) that was a perfect way to start the evening.  We ordered the dumplings and pork skewers both of which are a great way to start and splitting as well. We followed that up with some pad thai medium. The pad thai was a little spicy for my wife but it was spot on as far as Thai medium should go. She is just a spicy lightweight so wanted to mention that for those that are as well.  I call this place a taste bud explosion for your mouth... insanely good.  At the end Max made me a simple liquor only drink and sadly don't recall the name so will need to go back just so I can have another.  Highly recommend this restaurant and we definitely will be back!",

The restaurant is tiny so there's not much seating. I was okay with our 25-30 minute wait to be seated. We checked out the Rewind bar next door. Since we had waited we already knew what we wanted and were ready to order immediately after being seated. It took 40+ minutes to actually get our food. Don't come here if you are borderline hangry! The food itself was good. Nothing over the top amazing to me. But maybe because I already have a go-to Thai place. It's a cute atmosphere for sure and the owner? Seemed to be very pleasant as well as the servers. I might find myself here again but not any time soon.",

I did level 6 on spicy, and asked for a hot sauce on the side. Our server brought out fish sauce with peppers in it. So good.  Dessert, we had the bread with custard and it was unique!

It's a little small but wasn't too overly crowded or anything!  The manager (I think) stopped and talked to us, he was really nice and informative. Our server was too! We started off with these chive rice cubes that were fried and served with a spicy soy sauce. We liked the sauce but the rice cubes were pretty bland. Bland is not what I expect from a Thai place, but they still tasted good. I didn't see tofu on the menu, but I asked and they said they had tofu and I could substitute tofu for any meat dish! I ended up getting the kao soi with tofu. It was pretty tasty and a large portion! I would certainly order it again, though it lacked a little spice so maybe I'd have to say something about that next time. The menu made it seem like their food would be spicy, but everything seemed a little mild to me, and I'm usually sensitive to spice. We also got the steamed white bread with custard for dessert, I hadn't even heard of it before but it was sooo good! This place is a bit pricey but good quality stuff, worth it. I'd come back her for sure.",

I personally don't feel their prices are high because they claim to use higher quality meat and seafood. The inside dining area can get pretty loud. We arrived a few minutes before they open and people were waiting in their cars. The restaurant filled up quickly. We started with the dumplings and wings. My husband thought both apps were good. I ordered the Pad Thai and I have had better. Hubby ordered the Kapro gai kai dao (minced chicken). He thought it was fantastic as the sweat appeared on his face. He enjoyed it! We also shared the Crab Fried Rice. I thought it was very good where as hubby thought it was very salty. We both had Thai tea.

I cook a variety of Thai curry and noodles so I don't think we will return unless we are back in the city and want to try other dishes.",

Family pictures on the wall cute simple decor.  The food is outstanding we tried four different foods and each was unique and fabulous. To start we had the steamed dumplings, omg these were so tasty and full nice flavor I could have ordered more. Then the Somtum thai salad that was really refreshing and simple. Then I got a special for the day which was deep fried mushrooms which is called the mushroom salad and it was so good, the mushrooms where huge. Then we finished with the pad Thai with chicken and all I have to say is it is the best ever! The chicken was cooked perfect and the sauce was absolutely fantastic.  The waiters are so nice and friendly and go above and beyond! The drinks are worth the try I stuck with the melon patch fizz and I don't know if I would ever order anything else it was that good.",

My wife suggested, so we went right at opening on a Friday night. We were greeted by friendly folks and promptly seated. The crowds started getting legit around 6pm. Food was good and man was it hot. I don't really know the names of the dishes, but we started with the pork dumplings. My wife has some hotter than h$ll dish which she liked, while I had some special with glass noodles and shrimp. It was really good, and so-so hot. This is a great vine type of place with great service one would expect. I am anxious to go back and try the other dishes. Patio seating in the early fall and spring would be amazing here, which they do have. Parking is tricky, so be patient.",

    "text": "This place has a lot of potential but there are some kinks that need to be ironed out. I'm not sure if Friday nights are normally as busy but it was a packed house. So we did have to wait 25 minutes for a table (which I never have a problem with.)   Since we had a bit of a wait, I went up to the bar to get us some drinks. The bartender told me I wasn't allowed to order drinks from the bar on my own and that our server has to get the drinks. I told him that we haven't been seated yet and would like a drink while we wait. He again told me I could not order and told me to go back to the waiting area and he would come out to get my drink order. Aside from that being a rather odd rule that customers can't order drinks from the bar, he never came out to get our drink order as he said he would. So right away that left a bad impression before even being seated.  Once seated, our server was nice but seemed very distracted. Most of the time as we were speaking to him, he'd be looking off in other directions as if he had somewhere else to be. He wasn't very social and almost seemed uncomfortable.   Service was slow but I do understand that since it was a busy night so let's get to the food itself. We ordered Pot Stickers and Asian Wings as appetizers. The Pot Stickers were the best I've had and absolutely worth ordering. The wings, not so much. They were so over deep fried that there was a burnt taste to them that even the sauce couldn't cover up. However, the main dishes were all very good. I had a chicken curry noodle soup dish (Kao Soi) and it was by far the most flavorful noodle dish I've ever tasted. It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy and had the perfect amount of substance. My friend had the Pad Thai, which was good and my husband had a noodle and rice dish that was also very flavorful.   Overall, the food is good and worth trying if you like authentic Thai cuisine. The strange rule from the bartender of not being able to order drinks while waiting 25 minutes for a seat is rather odd and I hope isn't a normal rule.",

    "text": "Glai Baan has managed to push all the other Thai restaurants I like down a slot and claim first place with me. I like that they offer items you can't get at other Thai eateries. Their specialty is Thai street food but they have things like pad Thai for the more vanilla taste buds.  My favorite item has to be those darn pork dumplings. They are very similar to the xiao long bao you can get at Chinese soup dumpling restaurants. They were so flavorful, so tender that my party and I ordered another plate of them. I also had the very aromatic Thai sausage. We did order pad Thai which was very tasty. I also had the son-in-law eggs, which are boiled and fried. They were good but I don't think I would pay money for just ONE egg.  The ambience is really like every other Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Pictures of the king (RIP), simple wooden chairs and tables and loud table cloths for the patio. Anyway, with the way they cook, I don't care what the decor is. Looking forward to a return visit!",

The first person I met when I walked in the door was Dan, one of the owners of this jewel of a spot who offered to seat me immediately. Unfortunately, my friend hadn't arrived yet but Dan said not to worry he would take care of us as soon as the party was complete. I'm thinking that meant a long wait as the place was jammed and there were people waiting outside. My friend arrived shortly and True to his word, Dan sat us immediately. The food was superb. Tom yum moo soup was tasty as could be and my Pad Prik king was great... extra spicy as requested. Their wine list matches well with the dishes and is reasonably priced as are the food choices. All in all, a great choice.",

    "text": "We saw the review in the local paper and decided to try it out. We just moved back to the states from spending a couple of years in Vietnam and my wife is a Vietnamese food blogger and cookbook author so we've got some appreciation of SE Asian food. We've also spent quite a bit of time in Thailand solely to eat.  First the good: 1. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and there is a charming outdoor seating area. 2. Someone there really loves Doraemon, the robot cat from the future who is also very popular all over SE Asia but is probably unknown by most in the West. Cute touch. 3. The serving staff is ultra-attentive and kind. I'm giving 4 stars for them, otherwise it would be 3. 4. The flavor of my pork belly dish was really good, with a nice smoky aroma. 5. Back to the servers, they topped my water off religiously. Cheers to them! 6. Nice bathrooms. Clean and well-designed. 7. Good parking and street access  Now the bad: 1. As others have noted we paid more for Pad Thai than I have paid anywhere, including NYC, and the portion size will leave you still hungry at the end. This was True for my 95lb wife who is not a big eater by any means. My meal was similar in size and left me needing something more, although not at the prices this place charges. Either the portions need to increase or the price needs to decrease for this to feel like a reasonable deal.  2. The Pad Thai was just ok, and it included uncooked white scallions, which is a no-no. They should have used cooked chives. It was also missing tamarind sauce and the noodles were undercooked for legit Thai noodles and the vegetables were also undercooked and too hard for Pad Thai. It wasn't terrible but a standard $2 plate of real Pad Thai street food would have been a better standard to base their recipe on.  Also, for Asian tastes it was very over-salted, which is unfortunately the standard for Asian food in Phoenix.  3. There were some interesting-looking small plates on the menu but at a high enough price that I wasn't interested enough to try one out.  4. The restaurant was moderately busy on a Thursday night, most indoor tables filled, but no diners waiting to be seated. We were told that they wouldn't be filling our food order for at least 40 minutes since the kitchen was so slammed. Having worked both front of house and back of house in popular restaurants, I would say this is pretty unacceptable level of performance for their kitchen. This will lose the restaurant money as people decide to leave (as we saw a couple of couples do) instead of wait so long for their food. We had to wait 40-50 minutes for our food. Real Thai food tends to come out quick, fresh and hot so I'm not sure why their cooks aren't up to the task to keep their kitchen humming along.  I think this place has potential, particularly with the great staff and building. Thai street food isn't difficult to prepare, so they just need to make some adjustments to reach the level of deliciousness that you can get on any street or even in the Central World mall food court in Bangkok. They also need to either add kitchen staff or get their staff trained in managing multiple orders at once and get an expediter or someone to help keep things running quicker in the back.",

The vibe and decor is cozy and warm. 2 of my favorite things were the saloon doors that led to the restrooms and the wrought iron door that led to the patio. I really wanted to take a lot more pictures of the interior of the restaurant but I didn't want to be rude. I liked how repurposed furniture was used to store utensils, napkins, etc. Water was served in tin cups. We sat on the back patio which was decorated with trees that were lit up. There were benches for sitting and chatting. The food was outstanding, if you closed your eyes, you would've thought you were in Thailand. We sampled many dishes but the sea bass was my favorite, flavorful and crisp. Food arrived quickly, and the servers were attentive. Since I am a girlie girl, I have to talk about the restrooms lol. There are 2 restrooms, very clean and also gender neutral. I'll never understand why more restaurants don't have gender neutral restrooms! My only suggestion would be to have some sort of changing station for patrons who have infants or young children. I highly recommend Glai Baan as it is a perfect place for date night, families, friends, celebrations. We drove from Surprise and it was so worth it.  Will definitely be back",

And the pad thai was good.  The service is excellent, my cup of water was always filled and the thai tea is delicious, ordered a 2nd.

Host was again fantastic showing me how to use the baby high chair and alerting me of possible hazards on the patio. The Host's performance set up a great night for us, very welcoming and hospitable. I think it was just an off night here because the drinks were great, the food was fantastic, but the food took Forever to come out. Food came out very sporadically and the very last dish was for one of our friends who was unfortunately the last one to eat, came out two hours after we were seated. The rest of us felt bad for eating before him, but he insisted and we were starving with a baby in tow. When he finally got his food, he had to scarf it down because everybody else at the table was just sitting there. Sucky position for him to be put in. We were in a festive mood so all was well. Food was great. I will definitely give this place another try. Host and staff was awesome and service like that makes you want to come back. Like I said, off night.",

As a person who moved here to Phoenix not too long ago, Since moving here, ive yearned for authentic south East Asian cuisine here in the valley (being from Khmer, Thai, and Chinese decent)   I'm happy to say Glai Baan is doing something right, they're not doing what Phoenix wants. They're feeding Phoenix something they never knew they needed.   From dishes as like Khao soi, Pad kee mao, nam phrik, aren't really found her in Phoenix, possibly due to the major amounts of dumbed down Asian menu's to fit the cities palate.   Glai baan has become a beacon of light for Phoenix's food scene, something I been patiently waiting to see for this city. This place is somewhere I feel like I can invite my friends of any racial decent into my grandmothers home without the feeling of hopefully not chasing them out with the smell of fermented fish hanging in the air. Instead; excited for them to taste the roots of our ancestors without having to change the food.   Thank you Glai baan, you've made me proud and happy to be here in Phoenix.",

The staff are so friendly. The Phuket Bucket cocktail drink (for 2+ people) was good.

The atmosphere was one of my favorite things about my experience, such a quaint space with an extremely charming patio. Be aware in the warmer months that spicy food and hot temps make it difficult to enjoy the patio. The drinks were unique/delicious and we enjoyed the clever garnishes. We ordered quite a variety of food and I was impressed with most everything, it is the closest I've had to Thai street food since I left Thailand . My favorite appetizer was the Nua num tok, New York strip, it was cooked to perfection and the flavors were amazing. We also ordered the Peek gai tod, chicken wings, they were so crispy and tender. The Somtum, papaya salad, was light, crunchy and refreshing (ordered without the pork belly for dietary restrictions of one of my friends, but I bet it would have been amazing with). Our server said that her favorite item on the menu was the chive rice cake, I didn't agree, it was cooked amazingly but I wasn't about the flavor, probably just a personal taste as my friends seemed to be into it (only dish on our table where we left some behind). The Padthai was sooo good and also very happy with the Kapro gai kai dao. I will definitely be back, thank you for the great service and delicious food!",

May I suggest the following dishes...Pork dumplings (wonderful flsvor and texture, so much goodness). Oyster mushrooms (wow..just wow. Simply amazing). Glass noodles (Epitome of Thai...simple huge flavor). Curry Beef (the long wait for a table is woth the experience of this dish. I will be back just because of th his dish). Go eat here.",

Food: 5 Ambiance: 5 Service: 5  The dumplings, crab papaya salad and the wings are amazing. The best dish in my opinion is the panang curry. A must have every time we visit.  Service is very good and quick. The bar area is small and nice. Always a good chat when you sit at the bar.  Definitely in my top 5 restaurant list.",

Right when we walked in we were welcomed in and they made sure we knew the menu and the specials. We ordered the Kanom jeeb (pork dumplings)and they were delicious and authentic.  My husband ordered the Pattaya beach grilled chicken which was perfectly cooked and chicken was still juicy. My kid ordered chicken fried rice she said it was the best she had. She's my picky eater. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao it was absolutely amazing!  I loved that they had different (hot) sauce options. Katie was awesome making sure we had everything  we need it to make it an enjoyable dinner. The service was great and very friendly. The FOOD was BOMB but most important I have to praise the service that is what makes the ambiance pop. I would have to say this is the best Thai food in AZ!!! Will come again and tell others about this place!  Thank you Katie!!!",

I was dining solo but it would be perfect for date night! The service -on a filled-to-capacity weeknight  - was excellent. My waitress couldn't have been any  more  attentive . The food !! I ordered a  rice noodle plate with  crispy pork belly and veggies tossed  in a delicious sauce. I requested medium spicy and it still had quite a kick. Watch out ! You may want to order lightly spicy. If I had one suggestion  for improvement,  if it were my restaurant,  I  would install  a mister system in the patio  area in the summer months. It was very warm out there. All in all,  it was a perfect dining experience.  The best people,  epic food ! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Glai Baan is another case of a place that I had driven past 100s of times, wanted to try, yet never made it until yesterday. It's now going to be an effort to make up for lost time because this is the best Thai place in the area, no questions asked. I had noticed that every time that I had driven by the parking lot was very full. Being that it was a Saturday we decided to be there at open and that seems like it was a good idea because the place was packed by 6.   We both got regular Thai iced teas to start (I will return for a boozy review next time - no drinking for this guy this weekend) and ordered the chicken wings and the steak strips with the micro green salad. The wings were so crispy and juicy, and I could have eaten just those for dinner with the yummy sauce. The steak strip small plate was sooooo flavorful and bright, it really brought to mind all of the Thai flavors, so yummy. We were now faced with the decision of what entree's to order after being so dazzled with the small plates.   My fiancee decided to order the pad kra pao gai and it was phenomenal. Excellent flavor and it wasn't overcooked, over salted or oily. The flavors were very complex and crisp. I went for my standby of Panang curry and it was the best panang curry I've ever had. The vegetables were delicious, the curry was perfect and I loved tossing my rice in it and the beef was delicious. Rather than being small beef strips, the beef was almost like a roast that was so tender and and flavorful.   The service was fantastic, the food was the best and we literally don't have a single complaint about this place. Well I wish it was across the street from my house and open 24/7 but I guess those are both unrealistic dreams. Lol.",

    "text": "Great tasting food though small portions but terrible management of the restaurant.  Everyone is working hard, very hard, and that is commendable however it's just not smartly managed.  Tiny place with great food means great demand.  This place sadly is not equipped to handle that demand as I learned on one occasion they only have 1 wok operating in the kitchen and that causes major delays.  Also in the chaos they make mistakes every time I go there.  Actual examples being on multiple occasions I ordered two entries to only have one come out on to-go orders, while on another occasion when dining in with a friend to only have one entree come out.  When I asked the server when my entree was coming they informed me that we only ordered 1 entree even though we had definitely ordered two.  Like I would not order food at a restaurant for myself after waiting in line for and hour and fifteen minutes.  They rectified it and by the time I got the entree it was well over 2 hours from check in.  Not sure if their great food is worth this anymore, I've been here more times than I can count and it is consistently this way, and so regrettably I am moved to leave this negative review.  I'm ok going elsewhere from now on, and fingers crossed for another restaurant of like quality to pop up, competition has its way of resolving such issues.  Oh and they don't answer their phones usually, yet another example of mismanagement of the restaurant and growing frustration for their customers.  Regrettably.",

    "text": "Had this place bookmarked for a while. After a few beers, my girl and I were hungry & decided to stop here for a bite since it was down the street. It was a Saturday night around dinner time. We got in just right before the dinner rush. Place seems pretty small. The entrance was a little hard to find at night. Couldn't tell if I was going through the right door or not.   We decided to order a few dishes to share together. We got the wings, moo larb (minced pork meat salad), & the pad ke mao (drunken noodles) & an order of sticky rice.   The wings came with a dipping sauce. It was good but I feel like it didnt match up with the wings that well. The wings were lightly battered and fried perfectly! They were nice & crunchy, just the way I like them. The moo larb was pretty good as well. It comes with a little wedge of cabbage. But the best dish we ate was the pad ke mao, hands down. The flavors were so on point. Perfect amount to seasoning, not overly salty. We just couldn't get enough!  Service was pretty good. The water they serve doesnt come with ice, which was a little odd. I had to keep asking for a cup of ice because I usually like to drink my water cold instead of lukewarm. I felt like it was a bit overpriced for the portion sizes they serve. The plate of moo larb was smaller than I expected it to be. And the sticky rice was extremely disappointing to me. You pay $2 for not even a handful of rice. It was like half a handful. Sticky rice isnt much more expensive than steamed rice.. felt like I was getting ripped off cuz I could have saved those $2 and made a whole batch at home instead. Also, they have a very small parking lot that is a bit hard to get out of if you park in the rear side of the building.   Overall, this place is good. I will probably return to try other dishes.",

    "text": "OH MY GOODNESS! I finally made it in to Glai Baan and am SO happy that I did. First, the ambiance is so cozy, hip, and romantic. It does get busy on weekends so I recommend calling ahead if you have a large party! It makes the perfect date night spot or good for small groups of 4-6. The cocktails are truly unique, whipped up by a FABULOUS and well-known Valley mixologist (Hi Maxwell!). He made me the yummiest Thai Tea Mocktail that came in the cutest cup, with an adorable straw, and umbrella. Yes, please. I loved it. For all the mommas out there, have him make this for you!   For appetizers, our group of 5 people shared 3 orders (yes, THREE, they're that good) of their dumplings, one order of their fried rice with chicken, papaya salad, and their wings. Oh my goodness, everything was so flavorful but the dumplings are definitely some of the best that i've ever had.   For my entree, I ordered the Kao Soi. Think Thai Curry in a soup version with rice noodles, chicken, cilantro, herbs, etc. OH MY GOSH, obsessed. It was a HUGE portion as well. You better believe i'll be coming here on the regular during the wintertime to get a bowl of this comforting goodness. It is literally soup for the soul.  If you love Thai food, this will be your new favorite place in town. It really doesn't compare to any other Thai food that i've had in the Valley, or ever. Possibly because their menu consists of \"street\" Thai dishes but honestly, it is dreamy. You can thank me later. ;) We'll be back again soon, for sure!  P.S. Sorry for the lack of foodie photos! It was a tad dark and I just didn't feel that my photos did the food justice so I kept it a surprise! ;)",

Honestly it's better to park at the neighboring plaza because it's a lot easier to enter and exit. The interior is small and cozy, and they also have an outdoor area. I have gone with large parties that will be sat outside and it works. The oysters and the wings are a must get there. Probably some of the best wings too. They are paired with a sauce but you may not even need it because they're good alone. The oysters are really good and the sauce that it's paired with goes great with rice. Highly recommended for anyone who wants Thai cuisine done right. I recommend making reservations because this place is small. If you are waiting chances are you are going to wait outside because of the small building.",

After that meal, I decided that I like traditional Thai food better than the \"street food\" that is served here.   However, when a friend suggested we meet at Glai Baan for dinner on a recent Saturday night, I took her up on her offer as it was time for a revisit.  I'm so glad I did as I liked the food much better than the initial visit.  On both visits, I had the Pad Thai and the Chicken Wings, and on my second visit, we shared an order of Pad Prik with Chicken... all of those things were very good.  It's worth noting that the menu is a bit limited, especially for those who don't eat pork... there is a lot of pork on the menu!  That being said, there is something for most everyone here, including my kids who are pretty picky.  For picky eaters or those that aren't feeling too adventurous, ask for the rice and chicken and you'll be good.   The food is the highlight here but GB also offers a unique drink menu, attentive service,  and a low key casual yet hip ambiance.  I hope this locally owned gem stays around for awhile as it's one I will definitely keep in our rotation!",

The restaurant it's self is small so the waiting area isn't ideal. It would be nicer to wait outside but it's 120 in Phx right now. They have indoor & outdoor patio seating. I had a couple Melon Patch Fizzes while waiting......sooo refreshing! The 3 of us ordered a few small plates to share & 2 entrees to split so we could try a few different tastes. I couldn't even tell you everything we ordered but I do know the Pad Thai was one of my favorites. While seated at dinner I had the Laab Sided drink with fish sauce, it was very refreshing as well. The fish sauce added just the right amount of salty to the cocktail. The hour wait was well worth it! I will probably do take out the next time I'm starving though. The service from door to table was top notch!!!! If you haven't been to this gem spot, you're truly missing out!!! So go now! Check their days & hours open (they are weird)",

The owners have remembered us each time we've come and it has such a welcoming atmosphere. I highly recommend sitting on the patio under the tea lights and ordering the chicken wings. They will 100% change your life. We also ordered the crab fried rice and there was a good amount of crab in it. It had onions and a lime in it with an awesome fish sauce to add to the top. We also ordered the mussels. The sauce the mussels come in is so good on white rice! Would definitely recommend ordering an extra side of rice to pour all your extra sauces on at the end. Our waitress also provided great service and helped us choose the best items on the menu (not that you can go wrong). Great restaurant for a date night or to celebrate a birthday.",

It was the 3rd time we had tried to get in and almost left again, but really wanted to eat there.  Our friends humored us and we stood in the back of the restaurant and nursed a drink for over an hour.  People linger here.  It's a TINY place and when you can see that there are people crowded by the door, or standing at the back, you should just pay your darn check and leave!  The people at the table that we were told was going to be ours couldn't have been ruder, and sat at the table and drank water for a good 30 minutes after their check had been paid.  I wish this place had a bigger bar.  Waiting an hour is ok if you have a nice drink and a place to sit.  Oh and that brings me to the drinks!  Creative and really, really good!

I have been to Southeast asia a few times and this place is the perfect blend of southeast asia in america.  With the fooood, We first started with a papaya salad which was not overpowerring and was so good. The fish sauce wasn't too salty and the crispy pork belly was a good touch. We then got the Chinese Broccoli and pork belly rice dish. This dish was sooo soo goood! Sooo much flavor and the chinese broccoli just melts in your mouth.   We finished with an order of pork dumplings ( I know we did things backwards ). THE BEST DUMPLINGS! I don't know if they made then or if they came out of a bag but they were delicious!   10/10 I would def recommend this place!",

First off, if you were to the building when it was Mejico, you entered on the west side.  You can't do that now and there is nothing stating come to the front.  Okay, no biggie.  Inside it doesn't look much different than before.  Great!  It was always a cute place.  Drinks:  We wanted wine.  You don't order wine here. Their selection is mundane.  Whomever picks the wine has a very specific palate and think that everyone else must be the same.  If you want help with your wine selection, let me know.  :-)  Food:  Our table ordered Kanom jeeb.  They had good flavor and a nice dipping sauce.  I thought we were off to a good start. We also ordered: Pattaya beach grilled chicken -- greasy, tasteless strips of meat on the plate.  Kapro gai kai dao -- an enjoyable dish. Pad prik king -- an enjoyable dish.  We said we liked spicy -- 7 out of 10 on the scale.  We got a 2 out of 10 on the scale.  The mild sauce at Taco Bell has more spice.  The service was perfunctory.  All and all it was fine, but nothing there that will draw me in again.  There are better Thai food restaurants in Phoenix.",

The restaurant was very cute and quaint, and has a nice patio.  We had the pork dumplings and Tom Zap to start. Both were very flavorful and delicious. We fell in love with dumplings and if we weren't full we would have ordered more at the end of our meal.   For our main course we had the special (Jungle Curry) and Pad kee mao which is comparable to drunken noodles, again we were amazed. We would have drank the sauce in the jungle curry if it was socially acceptable.  For dessert we had the Kanom Custard, it had pieces of warm bread you dip into the custard it was on point, and an excellent finish to our meal.  The staff/owner/chef were all so friendly and welcoming. The owner/chef (Kat) came out and talked to us and all the other customers in the restaurant, she was very friendly. The bartender Max brought his own unique style to place, he made an amazing drink for me and was fun and friendly.  I will be telling all my friends to go here!",

Since they open at 5pm, we figured we can meet at 530 and it won't be that packed... well we were WRONG!!!! The parking lot was completely full and there were no tables!! So we were fortunate to find two seats at the bar. Max was our awesome bartender!!! U have no idea how excited I was to try this place out! We were both starving!! I loved all the anime decor!! So cute!! We started off w the pork dumplings and chicken wings!! Omg!!! The taste will blow ur mind!!! Not to mention how crispy the wings were!! We ended up having double orders!!! They were that good!!!  For our main entrees, we decided to share the house special which was the panang green curry w noodles and we added crispy pork belly for protein in spice level 4. And we got the pad kee mao noodles w shrimp in spice level 4. Think we could have gotten Thai hot since my gf and I love super spicy but the flavors did not disappoint!! I especially LOVED the crispy pork belly w the dishes! From now on, I'll be only ordering that as my protein!!   And lastly, we decided to do the custard where u dip it in this coconut deliciousness! My god I was in food coma heaven! And we didn't break the bank either! I'll definitely b back!! What a gem  Highly recommend coming early and willing to wait!!!",

We split a couple dishes between the 3 of us and loved them all. Sitting at the bar we got to know one of the owners. His passion about the food and culture behind the restaurant really showed through in his attention to detail and eagerness to interact with diners.  My only qualm is that I wish there was more seating for groups. I was in a group of four and we had to wait about an hour because there were only a couple tables that could fit us. Most of the tables are only two seaters. After one frost left because of time, we ended up opting for seats at the bar, but those are not open seating and we had to wait for those to be offered to us as well.  The staff was super friendly and kept giving us updates and offering to get us started on drinks. Would highly recommend making a reservation beforehand and carpooling as parking is very limited.",

I asked the waiter how very thai are they he goes- I'll take your order and you'll have to witness it yourself.  Ordered - Pad ke Mao: went with 2/4 spice level. Tasted really really good. Served hot and quantity was quite less for the price you pay. But, it's totally worth. Coconut custard dessert : forgot the name but it's a must try. Laab sided :  has cilantro, lime, cucumber served with vodka mix. This is the most refreshing drink I have had in 2019 so far. Must try again.  Ambience - 5* Wait times - 0 mins Service - 5* Very Thai and very impressed.",

I'm so in love with Glai Baan, from the authentic little restaurant, the servers, and the FOOD!   This menu is quite simple, but there's nothing \"simple\" about the food that comes out! I guarantee you, it's amazing! Every bite I took, made me say something, regarding how spectacular it was... I'm sure to the point of being annoying! (I didn't care!)  I enjoy this restaurant so much!   They inspire to be VERY THAI, and serve street food! It literally transports you to the streets of Thailand, and I've never even been there, haha!  But honestly, there's something about it, I guess because it's so organic, a True first time flavor, that is so different then you expect to have!   We ordered the steamed buns, then we ordered 2 more orders! These are far the BEST I've ever had!  We had the fried mushrooms-delicious, Chicken wings- crispy and so tender, panang curry-(absolutely Devine!) Pad kee mao the best,- fried rice, and pad -Thai! Incredible!   This place gets very busy, they don't take reservations, but hang in there, it's worth every minute you wait!",

My family and I shared a few of the small plates and entrees so we could sample more items and we were surprised at the depth of flavor in each dish. A few of our favorites were the mackerel fried rice, the pad kee mao, and the kapro gai kai dao. The place is a little tiny and get crowded during peak hours so highly recommend making a reservation in advance but definitely going to recommend this to everyone I know and will be coming back frequently!",

    "text": "The best way I can describe the food here at Glai Baan is authentic and supremely delicious. There is no doubt in my taste buds. Touting their menu as \"street food\" they serve the most formidable amazing dishes. They have an inside and outside seating area with every table occupied. A line of hungry people waiting to be seated. So when I say \"run\" and enjoy this restaurant, it is not metaphorically.   Our cohorts were Joyce and Micheal W. So the evening was already off to a great start. We even sat at the same table together! First and foremost, alcohol! They have a well thought out wine list and great list of beers. We ordered a bottle of white wine and beer. Cheer's! So here's the skinny on the PHAT (pretty hot and tempting) food we devoured:  *Started with pork dumplings which come 5 to an order. So good, we ordered 2! Please see photo. *Papaya Salad- super delicious papaya with cherry tomato and a homemade fried pork skin, what?! Yup! Please see photo. *Pork skewers- came out sizzling from the grill and an aroma that allowed no time to waste! Eaten viciously!  *Shrimp Padthai- noodles bathed in sauce then stir fried perfectly with a succulent chewiness! Squeeze the lime and Mmm!  *Fried chicken- Crispy Crispy skin with a perfect chili sauce accompaniment. It is not your regular fried chicken but 2 notches above.  *TomYum soup- please see photo!  *Panang Curry- braised tender beef in a wonderful red curry. Mop this one up with rice!   While some were busy taking photos, I took the opportunity to cheat, (since we were suppose to share) eating ahead. The menu is varied but not overly busy and pricing is extremely reasonable.  Because they don't take reservations, my suggestion is to arrive early; 5-5:30pm and you'll be ok. Past the 6 O'clock hour, it gets jumping busy. The food is definitely worth the wait ;) They have a parking lot attached although a bit cramped.   Thank you for reading =)",

So please don't be thrown by the fact that pretty much anything I've written about I've given 5 stars to.  I  feel a little silly for even writing a review on this place because they don't need it! If you've eaten there, you get it, if you haven't, then I'm sure someone will tell you to. Everything about Glai Baan is amazing, from the tiny, hole in the wall yet comfy feeling to the staff with great energy and good vibes to the outstanding food! I can not say enough about this place. They have a really interesting drink selection and were very accommodating with our vegetarian diet. We have NEVER had better Thai food in a better atmosphere being served by better people. Try something out of your comfort zone, it'll be well worth it!",

A line was waiting outside before they opened for dinner service which is always a good sign.  Waited about 15 minutes and reviewed the menu. The street food (like tapas) are a great concept, lots of variety, fresh flavors, and excellent service here.  Glai Baan is a small unique restaurant. They have a small full bar that has some tables. The main dining area is cozy and can accomodate larger groups. There is also an outside dining option on the patio.  We shared 5-6 different plates as they were completed. Hands down the favorites were the Kanom Jeeb steamed pork dumplings served with a scallion ginger soy sauce and  the grilled pork skewers.   Other plates included: papaya salad (Sumtum), glass noodles with shrimp in a tasty herb lime dressing (Yum Eoon Sen), crispy marinated chicken wings (Peek Gai Tod).  The last plate before our food coma was an excellent dish that included chicken, chinese broccoli, bamboo shoots and noodles. Hard to keep track of what we ordered but all was consumed and  all good. Spicy dishes are marked with a chili pepper.   Servers and management were friendly and engaging, made you feel welcome. Parking is limited but can park at the next door business after they close or Uber/Lyft.  Bookmarked this one for a return visit.",

When we sat down we were hungry so we ordered right away. It took about 40 minutes for our food to the table. (Don't go on an empty stomach) I got the chicken pad Thai because I'm basic but it's one of my favorite dishes so whatever. It was good but I could use some more flavor. I also thought the portion size was relatively small. Maybe it's because I have a take out Thai place that hooks it up. Am I too picky for this app? Anyways. I ordered they delivered it just isn't a favorite. Worth at least a visit.",

The place is tiny, and parking is a literal nightmare, but the food is just out-of-this-world. We have loved everything we've ordered. I especially suggest trying out a handful of appetizers to share, including the chicken wings and dumplings. The cocktails are fun and the wine list is actually really impressive.   In essence, this is not your average Thai place. In fact, it's not really like anything I've had to this point, and I love every bit of that.",

    "text": "\"Let's order the steamed dumplings.\"  \"The pot stickers?\"  \"No, the dumplings,\" Jon reiterates while throwing me a withering glance. It was at that moment that Jon realized that I was a lowly potato out to raise some blood pressures.  :'D  We strolled into this adorable place after having a couple glasses of champagne by invitation of Jon H. and his lovely wife. Having never been here, I was ready to try EVERYTHING. We ordered a few small plates to share: pork skewers, steamed dumplings, spicy crab papaya salad, and rice cakes. We also ordered tom yum soup, panang curry, green curry, and shrimp pad thai just for good measure. Everything we had ordered was effectively polished off. Easily the best Thai food in the valley! I was especially enamored by the steamed dumplings, the pan-fried rice cakes [I thought these were gonna be like tteokbokki but it's not], and the panang curry. There was some slow-braised magic in that pot of panang curry and if I wasn't in public, I would have licked, no --- ATE the bowl!  Advertised as Thai street food, I can see why this place is so popular! It's a cozy eatery with some indoor and outdoor seating. It gets packed fast so come during off-peak hours. Time to go visit your Thai grandma for some good eats! Not Thai? Yeah, me neither but at Glai Baan, we're all just one big happy family!",

My favorite was the mussels with a curry sauce with a lemongrass-like tang. The mackerel fries rice was good, and came with a sliced hard boiled egg, and side of spicy fish sauce (I think). It took the peppers out of the sauce and mixed it in with the rice and it wasn't too spicy. I would have liked this dish more if it had more greenery like fresh basil or some type of veggie (diced Chinese broccoli. The pork belly with Chinese broccoli was good but didn't wow me. It had lots of Chinese broccoli, and the pork wasn't overly fatty. The pork is similar to Chinese BBQ pork.  I like the food well enough, and I plan on trying other dishes next time!",

Thinking we were full and ready to leave a gentleman brought out a complimentary dessert of some fantastic sweet bread with a custard.  Overall the service was welcoming and so sweet, I really welcome this new establishment and wish them well with their endeavors.  Thank you!",

    "text": "Thank the food Gods for this slice of heaven. I recently moved to PHX from FL and have been struggling to find good food let alone good Thai food. I've struck out with most restaurants in general but, whatever standard the Thai restaurants cook by here have been whack. UNTIL GLAI BAAN!   There was a 45 min wait upon my arrival but, a delicious glass of Tempranillo rosado kept me occupied. I knew this place stood a chance just based on some of their unique cocktail descriptions. I will certainly be back to try them all.   We finally got our table which came complete with a very personable and humorous Everett; our server. He came out of the gates with a few suggestions and it was all magic from there.   We ordered the green papaya salad WITH pork belly. SO GOOD. Fresh, clean flavors. The dumplings are out of this world. I could've eaten just these two things and been satisfied. Next up was their \"son in law egg\". Essentially a fried hard boiled egg dressed with a delicious sauce. The simplicity of its flavors was delicious. Then came the chicken wings. I don't know what wizardry was in the batter but my goodness. Light yet crunchy. Subtle hints of fried garlic. A delicious and perfectly spiced sauce for dipping. One of the best chicken wings I've ever had. We may have squeezed in a second order of dumplings. Don't judge. You will for sure be doing the same. Last but, not least, pad Thai with shrimp. The shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked. A nice balance of tamarind sweetness and savory flavors. My friend loves heat so Everett brought us this delicious slow burn of a hot sauce with incredible cilantro and vinegar flavor. One of those creep on ya slow burns.   Everything was delicious. The vibe of the place is intimate yet social. Very cozy and friendly. I will absolutely be back.",

We are decent people and waited about 8-10 minutes and didn't get annoyed. Finally we were asked what we wanted. After 25 minutes, some pork dumplings came out. Good? Yes. $8 for 5 dumplings the size of a baby's hand? Cmon bro!   After about 30 minutes a gentleman came by and said we were next for entrees. Some sick foreplay joke? One could assume. 8:45 comes along, no food. I mean 55 minutes is already a crime. It gets worse. We ask how long and they say we are the next ticket. Another stroke of my cactus..... 8:55 comes only my husbands food comes. I'm livid at this point. Y'all were not even that busy. Not every table was taken. Cmon fam!   My food came at 9. 1 hour and 10 minutes after arrival. I'm not a stickler for service but I ordered a plate of god forsaken pad Thai. The traditional spot can whip that up down the street and it takes 3 minutes.. and it tastes better.  Look the food is good, the curry specifically. But $47 and a stomach ulcer from anger ain't worth this place.  No tip. You guys need to figure it out. Goodbye Glai Baan.",

And 1 dish was ok...  4 out of 5 stars only because I was under the impression that it was Thai \"street food\".    I think the concept is great but delivers a confusing message on Menu with portions and pricepoint.  Just go Northern Thai restaurant...  you are after all a restaurant!  Great wine program/beverage program....!  I have a feeling on my next visit I will be changing it to 5 stars...  Thanks for being in Phoenix!",

I'm from the East Coast and not that I believe we have better Thai restaurants in the East Coast I just haven't found a good one since I've been here... that is until they opened GB around the corner.  I've only been in Phoenix a year and I was back East my entire life, so in all fairness, I've had more time to find good Thai back East.  I ordered the pad Thai.  The flavors were spot on.  The heat was right on.  They are cooking from the heart, for the love of food and the love of cooking.  I order the Pad Kee Mao mostly and it doesn't disappoint.  They have, in the last few months made some adjustments to the \"streety-ness\" of the food, probably due to time and the size of clientele, product availability? It hasn't hurt the integrity of the product.  Please, no more changes.  I've also tried the Son-in-Law eggs.  It was good.  Damn good.  It had an rustic flavor.  I couldn't get away from the fact I was eating an egg in a bowl with rice and when I know what else is on the menu I rather try that.",

    "text": "This is a Thai restaurant and they actually put a little blurb on their menu about how they model their food after a certain northwestern area of Thailand. Then they add that it can be quite spicy for that reason and they designate spicier dishes with a chili pepper. It's small plates which I find is a great way to try new things. The restaurant is tucked down on 24th and Osborn and it is quite adorable it looks like it was a house but that means it is small, not uncomfortable but small nonetheless. I will say that we went around 6 and as we were leaving every table was taken and the bar was full and at least 4 groups were waiting for a table. Always a good sign. Anyways the food was amazing. You have to be willing to try new things even if you can't pronounce them. Remember it's authentic so the Thai names are used and then there is a description. The dumplings were good. There was a noodle dish with shrimp and minced pork which I loved. The flavor was so good. We had a pork belly rice dish which had I known I would have asked for MILD spice cause it was hot for me but not bad for my friend. We also had a steak salad which was SUPER generous with the meat and again great flavor. There were a number of people who ordered some sort of mint green drink served in a champagne glass. Anyway I recommend this place for sure.",

Small and not hard to find off 23rd st and Osborne if You don't know where to look you may pass by once twice maybe. I don't find any fault in that I just wasn't sure where to look and it was all just spur of the moment.   The tastes are intense and the portions although not extravagantly huge are appetizing and filling enough... especially if you have friends go with and you all share each other's course.  So let's see... there is a host and the service isn't bad. Although they do get busy enough as any good restaurant where you may want to flag down a server for more water but that's about it. No pushing  you through your meal... they are great at describing the item you may interested in when asked about it.  Parking lot is decent size and fills up but the store next door is empty/ as in closed down and moved  and I use that lot as do others  If you want a great take on Thai food that has tastes unlike any I've had here in Phoenix I recommend here.",

The noodle and chick dish was small portions and bland. The green curry that was on special had a nice taste but then paired with eggplant and rice noodles versus rice ruined what could have been a good dish but it wouldn't matter, it was just a special. The portions of meat were too small and its flavor seems like it was all cooked at the same time and then added after.  I wont be back considering the other great thai restaurants in the area like Thaiger or Thairama depending on the dish you are craving.",

And this is a dish that is supposed to be one of the hottest dishes in Thailand. The larb had almost no detectable spice, basically ground meat with some herbs. Some people here have complained about the food being too spicy. I must have gone to a different restaurant, because what I got was the same typical americanized, bland Thai food you get at most places in Phoenix. Maybe I have to try it again and beg the staff that I want to eat real food.",

    "text": "My boyfriend grew up eating home cooked Thai food so when we heard about this little place opening up, which specializes in Thai street food, we knew we had to give it a try. Its only been open for 5 days, yet its clear they're already getting tons of business (we saw multiple groups come and go despite it being 10PM when we came in).  We were worried that we would have a hard time finding it, but since its right next door to the old Mr Submarine shop, and very brightly and invitingly lit, there ended up being no problem. Parking was quick and easy and there was no wait to be seated. They have multiple seating options ranging from bar, patio, to their dining room and each is beautifully lit and cozy. We loved the farm house ambience with the soft Thai music playing in the background.   Their menu is still small at the moment as they work to expand but their wine list was quite impressive! Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and answered any questions we had. We started out with an order of dumplings, which we were a bit dismayed to find were steamed dumplings when they arrived. However despite not usually being a fan of steamed dumplings, we both loved them, our only complaint was there weren't more of them!  When it came to our actual dishes we were a bit let down, unlike many other Thai restaurants, they did not ask for a desired heat level. This worried my boyfriend as he likes his food to be almost beyond eating with spiciness, and I can be a bit of a wimp. I had nothing to fear however as my dish wasn't very spicy at all, but he was let down as his was listed as spicy but lacked even enough heat for ME to register.  I'll admit that I have had very little Northern Thai dishes so I wasn't sure what to expect, and I was a bit let down. My dish was 80 percent rice, the pork belly mostly fatty and far from crispy, and lacking any of the signature tastes I look for in Thai food. My boyfriend's dish was very aromatic and had a very pleasant taste but reminded me more of Indian food than Thai in its seasonings.   All in all we were pretty let down, especially considering we ended up spending 40 plus dollars on two entrees, one Thai tea, and an appetizer when at most places we could have received twice that amount of food for the price. But as the restaurant gets its feet more on the ground we hope to come back and try more of their food, especially their Nom Tok (Thai beef salad) as that is one of my favorite dishes.   So give this place a try if you're looking for a casual yet intimate setting, or late night fare that isn't a Berto's (they're open until 11pm during the week and until 12:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays). Their food is locally sourced, they cater to any dietery restrictions you may have, and their staff are all wonderful!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, but sadly, I did not. This was recommended by someone else as his favorite Thai restaurant in the valley, so granted, expectations may have been a little on the higher side. I wouldn't say it was BAD, but it was just mediocre. We started off the the papaya salad and the dumplings. The dumplings were the best part of the meal. It's very meaty and similar to shu mai that you would find at a dim sum restaurant, but with more of a scallion/pork flavor and less of a shrimp flavor. Although they were pretty good, at $8 a pop, I'd rather go to a legit dim sum place and get shu mai for about half the price or less. The papaya salad was decent as well, and the pork belly was cooked very well with crispy skin and all. Interestingly, it was served with chicharrones on top, which I personally have never seen at any Thai restaurant (including those in Thailand).   The mains were a little disappointing. The khao soi had a lot of potential and the flavor was good, but it was just way too salty. After a few bites, I couldn't handle the saltiness any longer. I ended up packing it to go, making noodles at home, and diluting it at home which actually made it pretty good. If you have low tolerance for saltiness, I would avoid the khao soi. The pad kee mao was average and didn't really stand out from noodles I've had in other Thai restaurants.  I did like the atmosphere of the place, especially the outdoor seating area. It was much more quiet and low-key than inside the restaurant, which was filled with people waiting in the front for seats. You may want to request an outdoor seat if you want something more intimate (as long as it's not during the summer season here). No issues with service either, as it was pretty attentive.   Overall, I would just say this place is OK. However, the prices did seem a little high compared to other Thai restaurants (which I can understand since it would make a nice, little date place). If you've lived in very Asian centric areas like LA/Bay Area or perhaps you've done quite a bit of traveling in Asia, you may be a bit disappointed. Since I live about 30 plus minutes away, I probably don't see myself coming here again.",

From the moment we walked in we were treated with such warmth and genuine hospitality, we sat outside in a beautiful setting and from there it just went beautifully from the service, to the incredible food!  We started with the servers suggestion of craft cocktails, which we were automatically blown away by that my husband had to order almost every one they were so good and pared perfect with the menu well done to Max, the bartender, he even visited us at our table! From there could not wait to taste the food! The beef salad and dumplings were out of this world, the chefs special entree was so good it felt like a genuine home cooked meal the broth was simple and so flavorful I wish I could have it every day! I ordered the pad Thai and it was probably the best I have ever had and that says a lot. With the owner Dan (who was the person who greeted and sat us) coming over and filling our water, checking on us it just put this place over the top. After everything I had to try dessert and man am I glad we did! WOW kanom custard!!! What a perfect end to a perfect dining experience. My husband and I have worked in restaurants our whole life, from fine dining to both working for some of the top chefs in the world and we can not express to Dan and Cat our thanks for hosting this incredible dining experience for us, both working in the industry as you know it's rare to have time together and last night, you really made it a beautiful memory. We will for sure be back. Thank you again.",

Because it is popular and it's small size, plan on a wait during regular dinner hours but just use that time to enjoy a drink like Hitochino Nest's Lager and soak up the atmosphere as there is plenty of it!      After 30 min.s, we were seated on the patio which is cute. (Picture included)      We started with the crab papaya salad. It is beautifully executed and the crab was crunchy and fun to eat but if you don't love fish sauce pick another small plate. Next we shared the panang curry with an extra side of rice. This was delicious! It is slow roasted chunks of beef in a curry sauce- the meat is so tender it just melts in your mouth. My husband said it was the best curry he has had (and he is no stranger to curry on his GF diet).      Finally, We ended with dessert (not on menu but ask your server). Sticky rice with Mango... their's is a warm rice with a buttery coconut sauce and fresh cool mango...terrific. (Picture of our empty dessert bowl.)      Yummy. We look forward to our return already.",

    "text": "Do not come here if you think this is your typical Westernized Thai joint. Come to Glai Baan ONLY if you want try something entirely new and take your palette on an adventure.   Atmosphere: It feels like you're in a historic AZ home, that has been transported to a village bar in Thailand.   Service: These people are all about the food. There is no glitz and no kitch. It's all about the flavor. That's not to say the service isn't warm. It is. But there won't be any plastic smiles or \"Let me tell you about the specials\". It's all about the food.   Cocktails: I had a Mekong, mostly because Roger Clyne talks about it in his music and I always wanted to see what it tastes like. It was delightful. However, would've preferred it as a digestif. It has that herbal and sweet thing that's great after a meal. The Orange Blossom Ale from Huss was the perfect compliment to the spice and citrus components of the food.   Food: We did the Dumplings...cuz ya kinda have to...and this crab noodle salad. The salad was very unique and refreshing; rice noodles, cherry tomatoes, the perfect amount of spice, and crab as more a seasoning than the star of the dish. The Panang totally ruined all other Panang curries for me. I had their equivalent of Drunken Noodles, which I cannot remember the name of. Pork Belly, wide rice noodles, and again...perfect spice. But, I like spicy, so do not think it's for everyone. They are more than happy to tone it down for the sensitive tum-tums. out there.",

There is adequate amount of crab in this dish. Some people might find this dish bland but I think it's perfectly and adequately seasoned. I have tried their pad thai and panang curry and they are both very delicious.   Over all, Glai Baan has impressed us tremendously, from the authenticity, the service and the general vibe of the restaurant. Give this place a try, it won't disappoint.",

    "text": "I've been wrestling for awhile as to whether or not I should review this place. My experience with Thai cuisine stems as far as ordering Pad Thai from Thai Express up the street from my apartment, so I keep telling myself that maybe my taste buds weren't built to handle traditional Asian cuisine. I mean, I'm half-Filipino, but that doesn't mean I know how to appreciate all other types of Asian delicacies. I finally decided to go through with this review, and I shall paint the picture for you.  I was visiting my friend who had recently moved out west from Columbus. This friend is even more well traveled than me, and spent six months in Thailand. He had heard of Glai Baan from various magazines and tv reports, and was overly intrigued by the thought of authentic Thai food. After all, he had spent most of college in Cincinnati experiencing the same Thai Express that I'm accustomed to, and Cbus doesn't exactly fit the bill for real deal Thai food either. All of this backstory is basically me explaining how pumped he was to try Glai, and how it ultimately let him down.  We ventured in on a Wednesday evening to find the restaurant pretty packed. Luckily, we were able to score a spot on their cute side patio. It was well lit and heated so it was the perfect dining spot. We both opted for beer (I am a fervent beer drinker, and my friend has some weird obsession with Thai beer.) Surprisingly, they had a nice mix of crafts from the west coast, so we were both happy with our drink selection.  I was leaning toward ordering the pad Thai because I'm basic/unfamiliar with Thai food, but the server steered me toward the green curry. My companion was super pumped because he could order kao soi, which is essentially Thailand's chicken noodle soup. Our food arrived, and we were taken aback by how pretty our plates looked. They were expertly put together and could have been an awesome addition to the 'gram. However, the consensus between our two dishes was that it was good, but we felt like there has to be better out there. For as pretty as my dish was, the toppings/noodle/broth ratio didn't feel very balanced, and I found many bites to be missing something. As for the kao soi, my friend liked it but noted that it didn't have the kick he found in many kao sois across Thailand. He added a lot of chilies; I thought it was cute that they had a little table side array of chilies available for her food. After all, I do enjoy the spice.  I would try here again if asked, simply because part of me feels like the dishes that were ordered on my trip weren't my cup of tea. I do love some pad Thai, and the pad kee moo sounds like something I could get behind. If I ever come back, I just hope the flavors are kicked up a notch.",

(And it was fun to try and guess why it's called a son-in-law egg...) I ordered the Panang curry, which was rich and savory and had an amazing flavor that was unlike any other curry I've ever had! Bf ordered the Pad kee mao, which was so flavorful that I couldn't stop stealing bites of it. For dessert, our server suggested a dish that was made of fluffy pieces of bread with a sweet syrupy custard like sauce to dip them in. I can't remember the name-but like our server said \"It sounds weird, but somehow it just works.\" I couldn't agree more! We will definitely be back and I can't wait to try the other dishes!",

It's an unassuming exterior with a warm, kitschy interior.  The staff was amazing offering just the right amount of assistance.  The pork dumplings are a must-try as well as the 'drunken noodles. The beef in the red curry was tender like short ribs and was perfectly seasoned.  Their cocktail menu offers unique options that are definitely worth trying.   My fear is that I have tried the best and now, nothing else will compare!",

I don't think I've ever been to any Thai restaurant in the metro Phoenix area that has decent wine selection and this place has great selection to pair with your food.",

The food and service are probably there, but it is a bit cramped and this is a personal thing, but i don't like drinking water out of a tin cup. I get that it may be a cute to some, but I'm not a fan. The service was super friendly and attentive. They have a well oiled machine and all work together in harmony. Creates a nice and enjoyable atmosphere, everyone was happy to be there! The food was enjoyable as well. Very fresh, tasty and well prepared. Our server had superior knowledge of the menu and was able to guide us in the direction we wanted to go. The Pad Thai was really yummy, the Larb and salad we had were awesome too.   Good experience, can't wait to go back and try more delicious Thai food!",

Forgot the actual name for it on the menu but this was amazing!! The meat fell off the bone and it was definitely something I would order again. The crab fried rice was delicious. It could use a little more time in the wok but still was good. It came with a side of fish sauce that i definitely used all of it.   I would come back!",

Glai Baan is game changer for PHX dining. Thai was a glaring weak point locally until this place, at least in my experience. Now we have a place better than almost anywhere I could find when I lived back East. Several of the tastes I had today I preferred to my Pok Pok Portland experiences. The pork skewers were absolutely perfect, made by someone who cared about my personal happiness, I swear. The dumplings were just about perfect. Papaya salad was very light and flavorful and refreshing. The Ka Na Moo Grob was soulful and deeply gratifying to eat. One miss was the fried chicken wings. They were fine, nicely fried, but the little bit of sauce they came with wasn't enough to really make them stand out from fried chicken anywhere else. I was hoping for more of a flavor punch. I cannot wait to try everything else on the menu. Service was good. There was a short wait for our party of 3 on a Wednesday night.",

I love Thai food and have spent time in Thailand, and this just did not measure up. I ordered the green curry, and it did not look like the picture of it posted here  as there was almost no sauce-very unusual for a curry.  Very small portion.  I had that and water to drink. My friend had a small plate and a tea.   Our tab was around $40 with tip and we left there still hungry.   Ridiculous in my opinion.  I will be sticking to my favorite Thai restaurant on Central that not only serves up value for the money, but outstanding taste, and I never leave there hungry. For the same price we paid at Glai Baan, we would have had a feast- much more and better food- and been much more satisfied..",

The Penang curry was as good as I've tasted in Thailand and Australia. Great setting too. Support this locally owned restaurant!",

The pad see ew should have been able to feed two people for that price but could barely even satisfy 1 from the amount they put. Tasted great but you would need to pay 45 bucks to feed one person.",

I spent 2 weeks in Thailand and can confirm that it is like eating on the streets of Bangkok.  Their pad thai and noodle soup were both on point.  Maxwell, their bartender, makes a mean cocktail as well, try the Disappearing Door made with a local rum!",

My favorites in particular were the pork skewers and the mussels. Also, definitely get the kanom custard for dessert! We will be returning soon to try the rest of the menu. If you are looking for a delicious and slightly more upscale Thai dining experience, give Glai Baan a try.",
