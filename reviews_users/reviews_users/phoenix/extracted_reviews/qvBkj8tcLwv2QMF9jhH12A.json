I went back a couple of days later with my laptop and ordered a Mocha. They don't have wi fi yet and when the server brought my mocha he asked me if I wanted \"expresso\" in it. He took my drink and added it, pretty good though and didn't burn the milk either. Good, friendly service and a modern ambience.",

I ended up with a salad which was pretty good but I guess that's not what they specialize in being a bakery... Next time I went back I went in.... Big mistake. It is so busy in there and very LOUD! I didn't have time nor the patience to really study the menu as I just wanted to get food and get out! If I do go back I will wait until the snowbirds leave and the traffic both in lot and inside dies down.... Disappointed",

Needless to say looking at the menu online now it stats made fresh, and the the chop salad does not have almonds despite what the person told me.  Well, my wife and I both got a half sandwich.  I got the turkey and unfortunately the most flavorful part was the tomato. My wife got the roast beef.  She said the roast beef was good but the whole sandwich was just blah We got out daughter the kids meal.  The grilled cheese was one slice of bread folded in half, not a whole sandwich.  There was also a fruit selection which we choose the grapes assuming they were fresh, well they were prepackaged, not what we were expecting from a place which serves fresh fruit bowls. Overall though the kids meal was plenty of food for the money. That is more than I could say for the half sandwiches.  We wanted to like this place since one opened up right down the street from us but we were disappointed. I also would have liked to tell the manager but no one stopped at out table to ask.  We had a runner and what I assume, from the different shirt, a manager walk by our table multiple time but they almost avoided eye contact and did not ask about our meal.",

The first time I ordered a guava smoothie, the club sandwich, and a lemon muffin top, I was very impressed and knew I would be coming back! The bread on the sandwich was what sold me, however the sandwich itself I found to be a little overly mayo-d. Today I picked up some pancakes with a side of bacon and sausage and I think they might be the best pancakes I've ever had. Thick, fluffy, and the home-made caramel syrup tops it off nicely by not being overly sweet. So far, so good. I will be back!",

I found a little kiosk where an employee might take my order, but it appeared to be blocked off with a bread slicer that needed cleaned up.

By this time, I'm pretty sure I've been standing here for 5 minutes.  Really.  so I left.  I get in my car and think about how amazing that freaking cinnamon smell was.  I decide to try the drive thru.  I was able to order quickly.  I thought maybe this was the stores forte.  Nope, wrong again.  Sat in the drive thru for another 5 minutes, and now I'm stuck. There's someone behind me. I sat still so long I shut my car off.   I finally get my stuff.  Good cinnamon bun, good coffee, but I won't be back to this location.

    "text": "My friend and I decided to try Kneaders for lunch. We arrived at 11am and there were 2 customers ahead of us at the order counter, but one of them took 10 minutes to place her order. She peppered the counter person with zillions of questions and held up the line. Kudos for the counter person for not being sharp with her after the first 8 minutes and seeing a line of 12 customers backing up behind the inquisitive (and thoughtless) customer. At minute 9, a second counter person opened a cash register and started taking orders to speed things up.   When my friend and I finally placed our order we both ordered the club sandwich (turkey, roast beef, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressing on a homemade white bread) for $7.99. The sandwich was large and tasty. It does not come with any sides (a dill pickle or small amount of chips would have been nice). They also sell a wide variety of baked goods that looked yummy. The homemade bread selection is extensive. When your sandwich is ready a staff member brings it to your table for you. Beverages are self-serve.  There is also a small boutique merchandise area (sort of a mini Cracker Barrel store idea). The thing that keeps this from being a 4 star experience is the poor customer traffic flow and overcrowding. There is a long line to order your food and even a long line to dump your tray and trash and another long line to exit the building. The line to order and the line to leave the restaurant tend to get jumbled together creating gridlock.  Parking is close to the door. The restaurant is clean and bright and seating is a mix of tables and chairs and booths. They also have a drive-through.  Would we return? We certainly would not attempt it at peak traffic times like lunch.",

My chicken panini would have been just ok, without too much flavor, but they packed it straight off the press naked into a plastic to go box. Without anything absorbent in there, the bread was soaking wet when I got home to eat. This has got to be just a rookie mistake, right?  The mushroom Brie soup was delicious and the bowl was pretty big too.   The triple cheese cauliflower tasted like mild cheddar and flour. Not terrible by any means, but I was hoping for a little more sophistication.   The chop chicken salad is in my fridge, I'll try it later. Looks fine.   The two soups and salad all came with a side of bread, and after talking options and suggestions with the voice at the drive thru, we came up with three breads to try. Unfortunately the bag at home only contained the ciabatta. Ciabatta is fine but it was the least interesting of the three, and was looking forward to trying a variety of the breads.   This place is RIGHT down the street from my house and open until ten, so I'll probably eventually give them another shot. I really hope tonight's wrinkles have been ironed out by then.",

    "text": "I decided to come here for lunch and little did I know it was going to be one of the WORST experiences I've had as a customer. I went through the drive thru and ordered my sandwich. Once I drove out of the drive thru, I took 1 bite and realized I wanted wheat rather than the frococia bread that it came with. I parked and went in the store. Standing in line, I could see there were only 2 people in the kitchen so I was prepared to wait. Once I got to the register, I politely told the young man at the register \"I just came through the drive thru, and I was wondering if I could change the bread on my Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich to wheat rather than Frococia.\" He asked me to hold on as he went to ask his manager (Josh Tycksen).  While he was telling Josh my request, Josh asked with an attitude \"Did we already give it to her?\" The guy at the register answered \"Yes\" ... Josh then said \"Well, that's how we make it! \"Next time she needs to tell us BEFORE we make it!\" He then rolled his eyes, huffed and puffed, shook his head and gestured with his hand to give him the sandwich. From the line, I could see and hear all of this! I asked Josh \"Is there a problem to change my bread?\" He replied to me, \"No, there isn't a problem, but I have 6 sandwiches ahead of you, so you are gonna have to wait!\" I again politely saod \"That's fine\". I stepped aside and waited for my sandwich.    While waiting I asked the cashier for his name and corporates number. I was given his card, but waa told they had to look for corporate number. Josh then yells to the cashier \"So, does she want whole wheat, honey wheat, what? I ignored him at that time because I was speaking to a young lady who was assisting me with contacting corporate. Rather than this \"manager\" asking ME directly seeing, I am standing right there, he then yells again at the cashier \"I STILL don't know what to do with this TBA for drive they! Is it whole wheat? Or honey wheat?\" Before the young man had the chance to ask me, to then relay it to Josh, I answered and said \" Honey wheat is fine\". He then proceeded to make my sandwich, hands or to the cashier and repeats, \"Tell her next time to tell us BEFORE we make it!\" The cashier began to repeat him, and I replied \"I got it, Thank you\". I walked out livid! Never have I been so embarrassed for simply asking to change my choice of bread. I encourage Josh to learn customer service skills. I will still be sending this to complaint to corporate. This was ridiculous and horrible. Yes, I will still eat at kneaders, but I refuse to return to this particular store. Josh Tycksen needs to be held accountable for his actions.",

He said, basically, shit happens and do I want him to give me a free meal.  I said no, that that's not what I wanted. I wanted him to know the kitchen was putting out an inferior product. And I walked away, whispering \"if you don't give a shit then why should I?\" I do t think I'll be back. Which is too bad; They have great dessert and breads.",

They also have a small fruit tart, nice lil bite of deliciousness haven't tried any of their lunch items... But I guess that could be on our next stop. Would recommend you ask for their \"loyalty card\" it adds up points or $$, not sure, but have to ask or mention it BEFORE YOU PAY. Because of course they will not mention that it's not valid after you pay...  lol.",

After placing our orders, the manager came out to give us our food.  The problem was he only brought half of the order.  When I went to the cashier to get the other half, she was great and gave me what I was missing.  I then get back to the table and realize the original half was made wrong.  This time the wife went up to the cashier.  She wasn't looking for a free meal or refund, she simply wanted what we ordered.  The manager overhearing the conversation inserted himself into the conversation and abruptly responds, \"So, what do you want me to do about it?\"  Uh, how about give me what I ordered?  Or how about lose the attitude?  If I am going to spend my time and money to go out to eat, I don't want attitude.  Needless to say, the next time the wife asks where do you want to go for lunch?  I will definitely avoid going back to Kneaders.",

    "text": "This place usually isn't one of my go to sandwich spots, but I was craving one of their smoothies so I decided I would give it another try since their food isn't too bad either.   I came in around 2:30 after my shift at work and decided to get the turkey artichoke sandwich that I've had before that I enjoyed very much. I ordered it with no mayo, onions or the pickle on the side due to my strong dislike for them.   I waited patiently while they made my sandwich and while I was in no rush I sipped on the delicious pink pina colada smoothie on this hot summer day. I noticed some other customers that were in my view walked up behind the counter because the guy apparently wanted more tea and there weren't any filled up by the beverage station. The guy who might have been a manager (since he was wearing a headset) seemed very annoyed that they did that. I agree it was rude to walk back there without asking, but what does he expect when the teas for the customers weren't filled at the beverage station? The man responded to him just saying it'll take 15 minutes to make more. No apologies were given to the man in need of some more tea.   The girl who originally took my order brought me my sandwich and I politely thanked her and got up and checked my sandwich just due to past experiences to make sure everything looked right before I left the place. Unfortunately, the pickle was still in there so I immediately threw it in the nearest trash can and also checked my sandwich to make sure the pesto butter was on there because they've left it off multiple times before.   I went to the front and asked the cashier just to confirm that it does come with pesto and she didn't seem too sure so she asked the same man who was wearing the headset and he stated that it's a pesto butter and I said that I was aware because I've gotten it before and it didn't look like it was on there. Instead of just apologizing and giving me an extra side and letting me on my way the man asked the baker or the girl who was making the sandwiches in the back if she put it on there and she yelled back in an angry tone \"YES!\" And the guy looked back at me and said, \" She said she put it on there.\" I just looked at both of them very confused because I was so surprised of how they handled this.   Just to be clear, I was not upset until I received the worst customer service I could've possibly gotten. I wasn't expecting anything, but just an extra side of the pesto butter, but they just made me feel like I was a burden to them even though no one was in line behind me so I wasn't preventing them from helping someone else.   I work in the food industry and they clearly could've known that since I was wearing my work uniform, and I deal with people's requests all day long, and since this was something so minor and how they dealt with this it made me never want to come here again. This isn't the first time the employees have showed poor customer service, but this is definitely the worst by far.   One star for the smoothie, but I'd rather take my business elsewhere next time for better customer service.",

Both were very tasty, but I wish their bread was thinner. I felt like the sandwiches were overwhelmed by the thick slices of bread. I also tried the razzleberry berry smoothie, which was good but a little too sweet.   Otherwise, the sandwiches and smoothies at Kneaders are flavorful and a make good full meal.",

(FYI - this is not a salad...lettuce and a sm side of dressing does not = salad) They spend more money on the containers than the food that is in them and this makes me crazy. Why can't you put a bit of tomato or onion or cucumber on it? Why I ask? What about a pickle?  I love the home style turkey used in everything, I hate that tomato doesn't come on the sandwiches and I forget to ask for it.   I highly recommend their bread but is pricey. I like the sacks for fresh bread end for cheap if you are lucky to time it right. And did you all know that Saturday night after a certain time all breads are buy one get one..

    "text": "I have been to this Kneaders location no less than 20 times since they first opened.  Each time I said it was time to write a yelp review but once I got home, I  tried to overlook the poor, unfriendly service that I received.  Today is the day I write a review.   Let me start by saying, I always go through the drive thru.  95% of the time, the service has been less than friendly and many times, I felt that I was putting the employee out by even using the drive thru.  I have waited as long as 22 minutes in the drive thru (4 cars ahead of me) only to be greeted at the window with, \"$16.34.\"  No, \"Sorry for the long wait\".......No  \"Thank you for your patience\".....nothing!   On NUMEROUS occasions ,  the bag was handed to me ....\"here you go\" and the window was shut on my face.  I found I was the only saying, \"Thank you.\"  I've come to the conclusion, they place their most unfriendly and rude employees at the drive thru window.   I don't take it out on the employee because obviously, they have not been trained properly in customer service.   Today, around 11:30 AM, my son went to Kneaders to pick up lunch.  I have posted a picture of how they packed the bag  ---1 full sized sandwich, an order of french toast and an order of bread pudding.  They were not placed in 2 bags or flat in the bag but they crammed all of it in one bag,  on their SIDES!   The inside of the sandwich slide out of the bread and was loose in the plastic container.  The bread pudding and french toast...well, you can imagine how those looked.  THIS is what prompted me to finally write a review.   I watched this location  being built and on the first day it opened, I went through the drive thru and spoke to a trainer who was here from Utah.  I told him how much I was looking forward to the restaurant opening and that Ahwatukee needed a place like Kneaders.   Ahwatukee is a small community within a large city.  Word of mouth goes a long way in this area.  Management needs to start reading the yelp reviews, respond and make changes accordingly.  My next trip to Kneaders will be to return my loyalty card.",

We also ordered a chicken ala  mondo salad. The chicken was flavorful, but the grated cheese looked like the \"pre-grayed\" stuff that has \"celulose\" therefore woos pulp. Didn't notice when we ordered that there was bacon in each meal, which was cold. Would have tasted 100% better had they warmed it up. My husband also ordered a cinnamon roll. Tastier than cinabun, but dry. The bread was the best thing going here. The final disappointment is plastic forks. Ugh. Not a fan.  Don't think we will come back.",

The first visit I ordered the chicken salad croissant and (while delicious) there was only a small amount of chicken salad on it, mostly just bread.  So that was kind of disappointing.  Next visit I ordered the French dip on the baguette and it was great.  Loved it.  Our last visit last night wasn't quite as great.  My husband ordered the French dip, but this time there was very little meat and just mostly bread, so he was very bummed about that.  I also tried to order a sugar cookie and they were all out.  :(  So...mixed reviews.  Maybe it depends who is in the kitchen that day.  But I think a restaurant should be consistent and I should get the exact same French dip, no matter which day I order it.  And its my pet peeve for restaurants to be out of menu items...so, hopefully they will work out these kinks once they've been open longer.",

The sandwich (roast beef) was very underwhelming.  First, roast beef must be thin and piled on. This was on the thick side and there was hardly any, the bread seams to smother it.  Taste is borderline bland.  Another negative, but I can't confirm this, why the closed on Sunday? If for religious reasons, then please keep your religion out of a public business. Same beef I have with Chick Fillet (although their food Is tasty).",

They forgot to bring out the \"parmesan\" chips.  They finally brought out soggy, tasteless chips  There was absolutely no trace of parmesan anywhere.  ALL of the tables were dirty.

    "text": "I like that this place has a drive-through, it can be difficult to find places with healthy choices and a drive through. That being said, this place is disappointing.   They used to have several vegetarian options. I don't know why they changed their menu but now they have three: a veggie avocado salad, a veggie avocado sandwich (so if the salad doesn't appeal to you, put it on bread? The addition of bread is literally the only difference and it's a boring salad to begin with) and usually one soup. It should be noted though that the servers don't typically know what's in the soups as they have suggested on more than one occasion their baked potato soup that is packed with bacon as a vegetarian option.   They also nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. For example, I ordered a kids meal and asked that they substitute turkey for ham. They obliged but charged me $1.50 without telling me. When I asked they said that the turkey was more labor intensive so they had to charge more--ok, but why wouldn't you tell me when I ordered, and if the turkey is so much better, what's wrong with the ham? They asked what drink I want with the meal, I asked for juice and they asked me what kind. I said orange and they said that it will be $.20 extra. The only juice that came with the meal is apple. THEN WHY DID THEY ASK WHAT KIND I WANT? The kids meal comes with a cookie, I asked for chocolate chip. They said I can't pick the cookie unless I want to pay the difference. I am not trying to get anything for free, but they try to upsell you at every opportunity.  My kids did like the turkey sandwich meal, and it is enough food for two toddlers to share. I appreciate that they offer fruit as a side and their bread is really good.",

I highly recommend their bread but their other bakery cases items do not taste home made, more frozen then thawed.  I love getting their Paesano bread, its like a sour dough with out the bitey sour.  It is my go to bread to make grilled cheese sandwiches and freezes very well so you don't have to hurry and use a loaf.  Their Hazelnut 12 Grain bread is Ah-Maz-ing but at a $6 price tag, is not a loaf I order often.  Come in early because they do clearance day old bread at the rack by the register.  Menu items are hit and miss.  I love the turkey bacon avocado salad but the bacon is pre-cooked bacon and sometimes the turkey portions, although large, are fatty and stringy pieces from the breast bone.  Some soups are good but rotate, are seasonal, or run out quickly and are substituted  Kneaders is on my list of places with amazing ranch dressing, you laugh but the ranch list is a real thing.  The reason for a less than stellar review is consistency.  Sometimes I have a great meal, other times quality is lacking.  Sometimes I get a decent sized piece of pie, other times it is a sliver.  Sometimes my slice of Triple Chocolate Cream pie comes with a crust, other times the server left it in the pie tin.   I also try to call ahead to check on bread items being in stock (learned my lesson after getting stuck in the drive through for 15 min when they ran out of bread) but no one answers the phone.  They offer online ordering but what is the point of ordering online, driving there, and finding out they were out because no one can answer the phone.  This place is good when its good but I never know what I am going to get.",

If you're a foodie that knows a good loaf, you'll definitely appreciate this.  The pastries are constantly changing but for the mini pies and cannolis, get there early in the morning and eat as soon as possible. The crispy, flaky bread definitely doesn't stay that way all day. Get 5 and then they're discounted. Totally worth it. I LOVE the German chocolate pastries (not a cake but more like a layered square) and the bottomless French toast is to die for. Seriously amazing.   Additionally, the atmosphere is pretty cute. There's a little shop with trinkets to look at while you're waiting for your goodies. The coffee is always solid. The staff are attentive and friendly and usually pretty young. I've had nothing but great experiences here :)",

They offer an all you can eat French toast that I hope to try sometime soon.   One of The best thing about Kneaders is that you can get quality food in a drive through. This makes it nice when you have little ones that you don't want to get out of the car. Speaking of kids, they have a grilled cheese kids meal that my kids love.

Once my order was in I looked behind me and there was a line of people behind me with still only the one new person working a register. Food was finally brought out to me and the sandwich was cold. Very disappointed with the lack of team work and quality of the food.",

I guess they must be trying to establish an old-timey feel, but it's not a fifties diner, so it's not really necessary for the theme -- and let's face it, the percentage of their customer base who likes that kind of music is pretty small.  Everything else about this place is great!",

She said ok, so I walked to the cookie display case to find out what kind of cookies were available. She never moved and left me standing there then waited on a man who came to order lunch to go. After he paid for his food I approached the counter person again and repeated my request to buy cookies. Again, she says OK, and I was finally able to get her to move over to the cookie case where she stood behind the glass unable to hear me as I asked questions about the cookies. Finally, I told her what I wanted, then back to her register to pay. I'm expecting her to get the cookies at this point, but no, she just stood there at the register and then rang up other folks. I'm still trying to figure out how I'm supposed to get the cookies when after at least 5 minutes, register girl says \"They're replacing that brownie for you.\" I have no idea what that means but finally a girl shows up with a pizza box with my cookies. So the cookies on display are fake? Are they baking the cookies to order? Why no list of the cookie flavors? Anyway you could train your staff on customer service?",

The greens were fresh and the soda fountain was bubbly!! Great work, kneaders!  Delicious pulled turkey! Hella fluffy focaccia! I came here for a fresh lunch and was (mostly) satisfied. My main complaint is receiving discolored lettuce in my entree salad. The soda machine was flat, too! Complaints aside the other components were perfect, especially the avocado! The dessert case was huge and beautiful- it took all my might not to order one. However, I did eat the entire complimentary piece of fresh made focaccia. Yum yum yum. The staff were friendly and had an impressive sense of urgency to make sure the intimidating line moved very quickly.",

If your looking for a cute little gift for a girlfriend be sure to check out their market inside the store.   My favorite salad is the turkey, bacon avocado! The turkey is just like you get on Thanksgiving. Big shredded chunks of breast meat.   My hubby likes to build his own sandwich by picking every individual item he loves.

Tasty but really lacked substance as far as the meat is concerned.  4 sandwiches were $38. 2 turkey bacon avocado on foccaia bread and was incredibly too big bread slices and a wee amount of turkey. A chicken pesto panini that was so thin I think there was only 1 slice of chicken to match 1 slice of cheese. The pesto didn't even spread to the crust of the bread. Really disappointing.  The only sandwich that looked filling and worth the price was the chicken salad croissant. Very large portion of chicken salad and then a nice side of lettuce in a cup with some dressing is apparently considered the side salad.  Not so sure that we'd go back. Just really overpriced and have had better sandwiches elsewhere.",

A:  Anyone can roast beef.   ;)  Kneaders is a chain that you can rely on to get a good soup, salad, sandwich, and some sweets!  I got a Reuben sandwich, a Thai Chicken Salad, a creamy cup of Broccoli Cheddar Soup, and some Chocolate Chunk Cookies. As per Kneaders-usual, everything was tasty. The Reuben sandwich was on the greasier side but I was splitting everything with a co-worker so it was fine. I absolutely love the Thai Chicken Salad. It was flavorful and the cashews gave it a nice crunch. As for that soup, that is a two Lactaid minimum kind of soup and even then, you're playing \"chicken\" with the Bathroom Gods. #LactoseIntolerant I enjoyed the cookies. They stayed pretty good even though I left them out in the open for a day. I think out of everything I had, I liked the salad the most. I love a good bowl of greens.

The Native American Girl at the counter deserved 5+ stars for being super nice and friendly and having a great smile that makes breakfast even better! She was the main person who kept taking care of my French Toast refills with an always service with a smile attitude. Seriously, she was great and deserves a raise!   Prices seemed great, awesome value for quality here.   The French toast is unlimited which is happy for a bigger guy like me. It turns out you can only eat so much since they are awesome fresh and thick pieces of tasty goodness that when combined with there super great syrup makes your stomach smile!   The omelette was really good too, but kind of small for a big guy.... Lol...   I really cannot say anything bad about this place and it will now become one of my new favorites when I am in the area!",

I gave them a four  star because of the pricing average is $10 which is a bit much ...  They don't have much in the way of coupons or discounts ... which could really take them a long way in return customers  But this lady will definitely break a piggy bank to come back   In addition to my previous review.. I read a lot of others and honestly some of the ones showing browned avocado or wilted lettuce or sweated sandwiches ... sounds like u have a classic case of shouldn't have waited to get home in this Arizona heat to eat ur meat!... those pics look like food that sat in the car .. not food that was eaten right away !  I have been coming here for over a year and they have always been spot on ! And when they haven't been they have been quick to fix! Try em'",

The first time I went to Kneaders on Ray, I ordered the Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich and thought it was great. I work in Ahwatukee and it was a quick grab through the drive through before heading back to Tempe where I live. I went back the next week for the same order through the drive through. When I got home, they had forgotten the bacon on my Turkey Bacon Avocado. I was bummed. I mean, the bacon is the best part! But I let bygones be bygones. I even went back today. Same order through the drive through. When I got home, I was starving, had the baby in the backseat crying, was struggling with my bags and was ready to eat my sandwich in peace. But they forgot the bacon AND the avocado. I am probably too upset about this. My husband thought I had gotten some terrible news--I was close to tears. I just wanted to call the manager and tell them that that they should tighten up protocol but they didn't answer which made me even more mad, so here I am, not wanting to be mad but fueling it all by writing this review. I guess the moral of the story is check your food when you go through the drive through--but I shouldn't have to peel through the layers, hunting for crucial, delicious parts of a sandwich that are IN THE TITLE OF THE SANDWICH. So I won't be back. I feel a little bit better now. But not much.",

It takes a while for anyone to show up to take the order.  Recently they gave me their frequent buyer card. I tried to register it but it wouldn't accept the number. I tried in different ways but no success. I asked the lady at the register for help. She ignored me while she was taking orders. I waited patiently. When I told her about the card not being accepted, she said it's corporate; I can't do anything about it. Talk to the manager. I asked for the manager several times. I could see her doing some things at the back but she completely ignored me. In frustration I walked out. I will never go to this Kneaders location again. I don't know if their other locations give equally poor customer service. Their Don't care attitude is troublesome. I will try to contact their corporate office and file a complaint. Not sure what kind of response I will get, if this is the company culture. Why bother offering frequent buyer card that doesn't work, and not even help the customer?

    "text": "I REALLY want to like this place, but my experiences so far have been underwhelming. I usually grab lunch on my break and take it back to the office, so having a healthier drive thru option rather than calling in orders is great for me. I have been here twice. The first time, I got a sandwich. Compared to the thick focaccia bread, the meat was practically nonexistent. Now I know focaccia bread is supposed to be thick, but the contents need to match so I don't feel like I'm just eating a loaf of bread.  My second visit, I got the turkey bacon avocado salad with ranch and a slice of sourdough. They forgot the sourdough, and the salad had one tiny piece of thinly sliced bacon on it. The turkey was abundant enough and there was a quarter of a fresh sliced avocado. Not terrible, but a pretty boring salad I could have easily made at home. I do appreciate two sides of ranch as most places are stingy with the dressing.  The person at the drive thru on my second visit also seemed like he would rather be anywhere else in the world at that moment. He would cut me off with \"anything else?\" before I even finished asking to hold the tomatoes. I know the lunch rush can be hectic and patience wears thin, but my order was painless. No need to rush me.  Overall it's not terrible, but definitely not worth $10.59 for a salad and a small drink.  UPDATE 2/26/2014: I tried to give this place a chance. I really, really did. But I think I'm done. I have visited this place (drive thru only) about 6 times since my first review. I order the turkey bacon salad every time, hold the tomatoes. I've gotten tomatoes every time except once. I even once told them I was allergic, hoping that might get them to pay closer attention. Nope. I asked for croutons once, got a slice of bread. I asked for croutons another time, got nothing. I ordered a sprite that turned out to be soda water. Received no napkins/forks on another occasion... etc., etc,. etc,. It's unfortunate that small mistakes like these would cause them to lose a customer, but they're SO consistent with their mistakes, I can predict them before I even receive my food.  The one thing that has improved over time is the customer service. It's gotten much friendlier. Unfortunately that doesn't make up for everything else. Another location is opening up on Elliott soon. Maybe I'll give them a shot because I still love the idea of a fast food salad that actually uses fresh ingredients, but I'm definitely done with this location. Too bad.",

The employees are always very kind a helpful and food is made very efficiently and always tastes delicious. The managers occasionally will come up and ask if you're enjoying everything which is a nice gesture that I appreciate. Not only that there is always free samples by the cash register which is an added bonus! Highly recommend!",

One lunch sandwich was great, yet on the next visit the amount of turkey was significantly less. I sent an email lamenting the inconsistency, but never heard back. This morning I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich, consisting of a couple eggs, sausage, cheese, and served on a croissant. Sounds yummy, yes? But sadly, the sandwich was totally lacking in flavor. I'm not sure how you can put those ingredients together and have it come out tasteless. Regrettably, I will have to pass on a return visit.",

It is Paradise Bakery - but WAY BETTER.  The Cinnamon French Toast is AMAZING and it is ALL YOU CAN EAT - However the initial portion is so large I can't imagine asking for more. The caramel syrup that is served with the pancakes and french toast is divine.  This place is SUPER kid friendly. My kids LOVE the kids meals - especially the cookie! My picky son is so happy that they have peanut butter and jelly as an option with grapes as a side.  The Turkey Avocado Sandwich is delicious and a HUGE portion.  However my new favorite item is there Chocolate Coconut Bread Pudding. Be sure to have them warm it up for you. WOW it is amazing!    I hope I continue to love the place.  I think it is a fantastic addition to Ahwatukee.",

After ordering 3 adult meals and a kids meal we tootled home. Once we got there and unpacked I noticed they forgot all of our chips and pastries for the meal combos. A quick drive back and going in meant standing in line. Once I was to the front the manager was very apologetic about what happened  and gave me a free loaf of any of their bread I wanted to make it up to me, and also verified that was enough.    My point, they are new, they are bound to make mistakes but the fact the manager seemed very bothered by it, and even after tossing something free at me, wanted to make sure that was enough and was willing to do more to make sure I was happy, says a lot about this place.  The food was amazing, the portions are big, it seems pricey when you think you are ordering a sandwich but once you get it you understand. I had a fruit tart from there that is better than any I've had before.   We will go back, and often. I am very happy they have moved into our area and look forward to telling all of my friends and co-workers about it.",

Ample outdoor seating with parking lot views (could use some potted trees). Oh, and the food, can't forget the food! Their French Toast is fantastic. Thick homemade bread lightly dipped and served with sliced strawberries, whipped butter and caramel syrup--I was told it's unlimited but two slices will fill you up for sure! The breakfast sandwiches come standard in a croissant but we opted for the ciabatta bread and, while a bit big for the egg, bacon and cheese, it was so fresh and soft! So much easier to eat than the tough ciabatta bread at most places. The orange juice tasted fresh-squeezed and was an appropriate $3 versus the $4-6 they charge elsewhere. Took a couple of chocolate chunk cookies to go and they were soft and yummy! We are going back. And soon!",

The chicken pesto panini was so bland and lacking flavor that I didn't even eat it. The chicken was just a thin piece of flavorless meat that didn't even cover the length and width of the bread. Next time I'll just go somewhere that I know instead of coming here again.  I'm afraid to try anything else on the menu.",

It's the morning time so of course there are customers and out of consideration of other people wanting to order I asked the gal at the register if maybe she could get somebody else to help me to place my order. She called up a young man who proceeded to greet me with what's up. I asked him if he wouldn't mind just coming over to the bakery window so that I can place my order and he said to me \"can't you just list off what you want to her\" and referred to the girl at the register. I politely told him no I can't because I'm going to be placing a large order and I asked him if he could come over to the bakery window because I needed several different items in multiple quantities.  And these pastries are like 1.99 to 2.99 a piece so I'm spending a chunk of change...is it too much to expect that I could get some customer service?  And when I try speaking to the manager about the customer service all he has to say is\" I've got one person out  throwing up and I'm just trying to deal with staff what can I do to help you?\"  At that point I said \"nothing\" and I left.   I don't care how fresh your ingredients are or how good your pastries are I will not be going to Kneaders again for business or personal reasons at this location. Good customer service is good customer service and I would rather go to the local Costco or Fry's where at least people act like they're happy to see you want your business and will answer your questions politely without making you feel like you're inconveniencing them. Bad bad bad customer service Kneaders shame on you",

The least the staff could do for good customer relations, would be to ask the customer if they had a Frequent Diner Card before they finalized the transaction. It is deeply disappointing as the food is quite good. It's as if they have the program, but don't want you to actually use it.  Additionally it would be helpful if the cashier knew the ingredients of the selections they sell. On 2 different occasions my wife asked what was in a particular menu item, and both times the cashier had to leave and go into the back and ask for information. They need to be more knowledgeable about their menu. These comments are specifically for the Tempe store on Elliot Rd.",

It came with a side of dressing, so I guess that makes it a salad? It came as a side to my over-salted, under-chickened chicken salad sandwich. The last time I received a not insignificant amount of rotten lettuce in a salad from this location was in a turkey feta salad which was about 1/3 inedible lettuce. During my previous visit I ordered chicken dumpling soup. There wasn't enough chicken in it to even label it \"chicken\" so maybe it has this name because they use chicken broth? I've never been to another Kneaders but this location is extremely disappointing. I will not return and I will be shocked if they are still open 12 months from now.",

I paid almost $9.00 for a sandwich that was completely soggy (except the crust), and their version of \"pesto\" was to place several basil leaves inside the sandwich-which you couldn't eat, as they were steamed and tough.   I was starving, so I looked inside a small bag they gave me with the  sandwich, and there were a few chips. Stale, stale, stale-also unedible. So...for almost $9.00 I threw everything in the trash.  I would almost try it again, but I just don't want to waste any more money. Would NEVER recommend this place. Bummer, I love a good sandwich....",

    "text": "Short version: Great product, horrible customer service.  We've visited this location about a dozen times since we live less than a mile away, and we really want to like it, but this is no easy task.  Little thing: they forget part of our kids meals (i.e. the main entree) 50% of the time for drive through orders.  Bigger thing: consistently horrendous customer service.  I don't think that everyone working there is equally horrible, but there are a few especially bad apples, especially one guy who is a manager/supervisor.  This guy is is unabashedly snotty and unpleasant.  His idea of managing (from the customer's point of view) is to hover over employees as they process any order that takes more than 15 seconds and scowl over their shoulder at the customer if anyone stops to ask a question about *anything*.  One encounter that mirrors every experience we've ever had at this location: Our daughter has a severe egg allergy, so when we asked the first employee about their products' ingredients, they punted the question to Mr. Scowlface who proceeded to direct us to the signs under each pastry in the window (how could we be so stupid as to not know that ahead of time?).  Then we asked about other items' contents so we could order something that wouldn't be life threatening to her, and of course he reacted as though handling another question would cause him a great deal of personal pain and anguish.  I think it's safe to say that this this guy is in the wrong industry.",

We arrived a little after 9 pm and was greeted by this discontented woman that looked so perturbed that we would do something so awful as to have her take an order. We had some of our cookie and then my son was having a hissy fit so we left in a hurry and I didn't have ample time to clean up the few crumbs that we had left. As I was entering my car with my kids, I see the grumpy lady through the window go over to our table to sweep up our mess as she looks up at me and shakes her head back and forth at me as to scold me for leaving a mess!  I've never seen such blatant disrespect towards a customer. We are done with this place. She won't have to clean up after us ever again.",

I wanted to like them, but I cant.  I do have positive and negative.   Pros: they do have delicious bread. Flavorful, fresh and lovely. Makes for a good foundation for a sandwich. Its always been very clean. They don't skimp on avocado, that makes me happy. Avocado is tasty. Good iced tea too.   Cons: I asked several people if any of their soups were vegetarian friendly. I was reassured by 4 separate people that they were, 2 bites and a queasy stomach cramp later I learned they are not. I brought it to the attention of the manager and was told that none of the soups are vegetarian and given a half heart felt sorry. I had to ask them to refund me for the soup I couldn't even eat.  It didn't occur to them that this would be the best course of action. Their menu is limited in its flexibility and my attempts to customize to meet my veggie needs are only successful half the time. I have to bring my food back a lot to be remade after meat was on my sandwich or in my salad anyway.    The value of what you get versus what you pay isn't the best, but Im sure for many this is a great place to go, just not for me.",

The Manager/OWNER told me it would be $2.00 extra to substitute Turkey from Pastrami. Then he went on to tell me the Panini sandwiches are sent to them pre-made and that was part of the reason. So $10 bucks for a pre-made sandwich? Well what is the rest of the reason to charge $2.00 extra??  Just to make a sandwich fresh?  I expect a sandwich from this place to be made when I order it, not one that was previously made and possibly frozen for shipping.   My wife and I have tried to give this place a shot on more than one occasion. But each time we have left there disappointed. We have visited a Kneaders on Gilbert and Baseline and loved the food and service, but we live here in Ahwatukee.",

The sandwich was small to average sized and contained pastrami, sauerkraut,  cheese and a very unpleasant tasting dressing.  The pickle was nice and crisp but the chips were stale, kettle style but without the  crunch they're supposed to have. Drive thru service was neither friendly nor unpleasant,  just indifferent.   This should be a $5 sandwich,  not  a $9 sandwich.  Do yourself a favor if you're in the area and go to Jason's Deli,  Paradise Bakery or Hillside Spot instead.",
