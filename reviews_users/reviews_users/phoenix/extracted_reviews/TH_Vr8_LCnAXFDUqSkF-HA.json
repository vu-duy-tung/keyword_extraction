I ordered the Chilie Rellanos. Both meals were excellent. I am quite a Rellanos aficionados. Theirs were out of this world!! The special sauce topping the fluffy Rellanos was perfectly delicious! This dish is served with loose pinto beans that tasted almost \"buttery\". We were so happy with our meals. Would definitely recommend this to anyone!!",

    "text": "I'm an adventurous restaurant goer and savor the thrill of a new find, so when my Mom's friend (whose credibility was heightened by herself being Mexican) said you've got to try Popo's we drove the 20 miles with open minds and hungry stomachs.  We knew it wasn't going to look like the Taj Mahal from the outside so no disappointment there when it appeared inconspiculously on the west end of a tiny strip mall.  However, when we went inside it was truly a pleasant surprise.  We were instantly intercepted by two friendly hostesses who gave us friendly smiles and pleasant hellos.  Then we looked around and saw the place was really well designed.  Beautiful interior, flat-screen TV's all over the place (bonus), beautiful tile floors and just a generally well-kept appearance.  I bolted for the men's room before being seated (after all, it was a long drive) and for those of you who have eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants know the restroom is not always highly anticipated.  It was immaculate, had a granite countertop and hands-free everything.  Another bonus.  We sat down to the usual greeting of chips and salsa and our table of three unanimously agreed the chips were delicious and thin and crispy and the salsa was fresh-tasting, flavorful and with just enough heat to let you know you're alive.  I ordered the seafood enchiladas and was decidedly disappointed.  It wasn't bad, it just lacked a certain richness that makes a dish like that really sing.  My Mom got a chile relleno and taco---my parents are both relleno fans---and again something was missing.  It seemed like the batter was not prominent enough and thus lacked full flavor.  The taco, however, was killer.  The machaca beef was delicious and the shell was appropriatley greasy, lending to a nice hardy bite.  My Dad ordered a beef tamale which came nicely stuffed (lots of places you can't find the filling) but it was dry and lacked any real flavor.  He also had a cheese enchilada which was decent.  I must comment that my Mom makes THE BEST Spanish rice you'll ever eat and so we're constantly surprised at how much of an afterthought rice is at Mexican restaurants.  Not so at Popo's.  While it's not as good as dear old Mom's, it was the best I've had out at a restaurant.  Why?  It had flavor!  I tasted garlic and crushed tomato that to me makes it so good.  The beans were also excellent and flavorful.  Service was friendly and attentive.  I don't think I'll drive out of my way to go back but I would certainly eat there again and try different dishes.",

The order is enough for two peopleTo go with my order, I had the frozen sangria margarita. I normally don't like margaritas because I don't like tequila but this was so refreshing. You can definitely taste the sangria with just the right amount of tequila added.   The prices were really cheap. From the outside, you'd think this is a fast food type of restaurant, but the inside was totally different. It was decorated in Mexican decor and the place was packed.   The only thing we didn't like was that the service wasn't all that great. The first waiter that greeted us took forever with our drinks and the second waiter who took our food order barely checked on us.",

    "text": "OK so first off I don't usually write reviews for places but I had to this time. Now I came here because my brother Adam and his wife recommended the place. I drove all the way to the Westside in anticipation of having some awesome Mexican food. Here was my experience.  So I ordered a number nine and I asked them if I can substitute shredded beef on to the cheese enchilada for extra money. They told me no I said are you sure you guys don't want the extra revenue. Then the TS waiter told me can you read it says no substitutions right here and pointed to it on the menu and the girl that looked like his sister with the glasses also tried to make me feel stupid for asking. Then the heavier set girl at the front told me to go sit down if I wanted to order by the chairs for the people waiting not to order at the counter. I said OK, then I asked if they had any Agua Fresca's without alcohol they said no and they don't have to go cups either. Ok... then I said you know what I drove all the way from the east side I don't want the food to get cold I'm actually going to just sit down and eat it here they said no you're not you ordered it to go you can't eat here. It was insane I said look I just want to have a good experience I was recommended to come here and you guys are treating me horrible for some reason go get your manager right now. So the whole clan up front walked to the back of the restaurant. The manager came out after like 15 minutes trying to tell me that I ordered the food to go and I could not eat there. I said I don't want to think poorly of this place if the food is cold when I eat it I'm going to eat here she said it's long as you order a margarita you can eat here. Then she told me that I'm going to have to eat my food out of it to go box though I said you're crazy you're going to give me a plate. This place was insane how I was treated I cannot comprehend how they treated me. Now in terms of the food yeah the portions are huge the chile relleno was very bland and just plain bad. The rice was good and the cheese enchalada well it was a cheese enchilada. The Margarita was horrible then again it was only two bucks so what was I expecting though. As I walked out I told the \"girls\" at the front that they suck at their job and to have a good night I got in my car to leave. And about four of the employees pop their heads out of the restaurant look for me in the parking lot as if they were going to do something to me or say something to me. For their sake thank heavens they didn't. One star should've been zero will never come back.",

    "text": "I LOVE PoPo's! You really can't go wrong with anything here. Good salsas, good food, fair prices for the quality and quantity you will get.   Favorites:  Chicken chimichanga-  shredded chicken, it always tastes good to me.   Machaca beef ANYTHING-  whether you're having a Mexican pizza, chimichanga, etc.  I like the flavor of their machaca beef.  Green Chile bowl-  I usually order this with a side of jalapeno cream cheese. Very comforting and tasty!    Do try the jalapeno cream cheese, it's better than plain sour cream.  Chili relleno- whether you get it filled with meat or not, it never disappoints!   Mexican pizza-  I'm not a pizza fan but their Mexican pizza is perfect for a family. I believe they have an appetizer version, great for sharing and I've never had a bad Mexican pizza from them. Try it with chicken or machaca beef! Load it with some salsa and you'll be full and satisfied.  Carne asada burrito-  I like it with the guacamole.  I've tried a lot of things on the menu, more than what I've mentioned. Look out for the daily specials during the week. You can also find this info on their website. Come in on a Wednesday for a $5.99 burrito, it's HUGE! And not only is it huge, it's a winner. I think you have to dine in though. All I'm saying is why throw your money away at places like Taco Bell or Del Taco when you can have better quality home style Mexican food for about the same price? Places like Filibertos may have big burritos too, but their salsa is a waste of time! You really can't compare.   Lunch menu has decent prices!   The place is usually busy in the evening hours, there's parking in the back because it gets so packed! People are usually waiting to be seated- that's another surefire sign that the food is good and worth waiting for.    **The other location on Bell Rd is disappointing, if you go there, you'll notice a difference. The food just doesn't taste as good as this location.",

So ridiculous! We 3 gals each ordered $8.50 appetizers. Ate one there & 2 to go! Appetizers & orders to-go don't qualify as a meal so 6 Margaritas were billed at $3.25 not .99 cents. Waitress & Manager want to argue and make a scene instead of resolving. They've gotten so greedy here.   We gathered to celebrate my birthday and asked for the Bday fried ice cream 3 times and it never came. Such a bummer. Thanks for the memories and good food PoPos.  We will have to find another place now.   Pass along any recommendations for good Mexican food with great yet affordable Margaritas! We need a \"re-do!\"",

It took over 15 minutes for the waiter to come take my ice tea order and another 5 minutes to get the ice tea.  I ordered a machaca chimichanga dinner, enchilada style. When I received my food, the plate looked scrumptious. It wasn't. I  love Sonoran style Mexican food, having grown up in the border towns, and of Mexican descent. The beans were a salty, dark blob, not fresh at all. The enchilada sauce lacked flavor or any seasoning. The machaca meat was salty also. The rice is the only reason this review gets a 2 star and not a 1 star, the rice was just right, flavorful, not dry and tasted like my Abuelita had made it. Service lacked and the food did not meet the hyped expectation. The waiter gave most of his attention to the white couple seated across from me, maybe he thought I wouldn't tip, being obviously Hispanic. He got a 35% tip from me, even though his behavior warranted less. Sorry I won't be back.",

This location is also \"known\" for having better food then the on me on 59th ave but they are both very good to me! The salsa is fresh and warm chips and the retried beans are the BEST! I usually skip the beans, but not at Popo's!! I ordered a machaca beef taco and the shredded chicken burro with jalapeno cream cheese. Always one of my favorite Mexican meals. It's spicy but so good! The meals are huge so be prepared to take home leftovers but it reheats nicely. The service was very friendly and quick and it is always busy there with about a 15-30 minute wait if you go at dinner time, any day of the week. My friend ordered the fajitas which is her favorite as well. They come out hot and sizzling with all the sides. Stay away from chain Mexican places and hit up Popo's if you want some REAL Mexican food.",

Grew up in Los Angeles so I've had Mexican food up, down, and sideways and like to think I'm a decent judge of it. When we moved to AZ this happened to be one of the first places we tried as it was recommend to us by family from AZ. At first glance it may look sketchy. It's at the tail end of a small shopping center with a pawn shop and looks tiny. Deceiving tho because the inside is pretty big and it's clean.   Food tho is AMAZING!!!! Comes out piping hot and plates loaded. My faves are the mini chimichangas (I've had all of the meat fillings) which my kids also LOVE! Burritos are to die for and while all of their meats are good, the asada is especially delicious. I can't stand asada with lots of fat and gristle and they trim theirs to perfection. Have always had great wait staff and if you can make Happy Hour do it. Margaritas for $3 and you're feeling good after one or two!!! There is another Popos location on Bell Rd, which I hear is nicer. Maybe it's the newer location, but I've only ever had great experiences at the Indian School location so I continue to go there and I actually frequent Bell more often. Maybe I'll get around to going someday in the meantime, you go here!",

In fact, there have been times where the waitresses (especially one particular waitress, with short, curly hair, who has been there forever) are just down right rude. I have gone there with about 30 different people (my school district is in the same area so everybody in my district goes to Popo's, especially on days that we have half days or professional developments), and the several times that we've gone, it NEVER fails!!!....my colleagues complain that the service is bad and the waitress is rude. I even told the manager about one particular waitress and he didn't seem to care much.  If you walk in knowing that, you'll be okay. The salsa is beyond delicious though! I am pretty picky about my salsa since I grew up in an authentic Mexican food environment and I will tell you, you'll love their salsa.  So....5 stars for the salsa, 2 and a half stars for the rest of the menu and 1 star for the service. However, because I LOVE their salsa, I wilm always come back.",

And it works for me.  The other day, after a long hot hike in the desert,  we ended up here to completely stuporize ourselves. I was pleased to see the happy servers and multigenerational groups getting some shade and 99 cent margaritas on a Sunday afternoon. I looked around at what the other diners were having and decided on the chimichanga, enchilada style. I really liked the enchilada sauce and the red chili filling which was actually spicy with melt in your mouth cubes of beef. Seriously like my mom used to make. I skipped the rice and beans because this deep fried baby was more than filling on its own. Especially as we had started with a small bowl of the chile con Queso dip that was soothing and smooth with just a little kick. The chips accompanying the dip were warm and crisp.  This is the place when you want Mexican comfort food that actually also has some flavor. As other reviewers have noted, it's heavy and hearty fare.  But sometimes that's what you need.",

We had a 20 minute  wait before we were seated.  We were served chips and salsa. The salsa was really really good. We were seated next to a  birthday party with maybe 25-30 people. We ordered the jalapeno poppers which took almost 1/2 an hour to arrive. For our meal we ordered two taco platters.  It was over an hour before two fish tacos and one carne asada  taco to finally arrive. My wife and I had ordered the same thing something we seldom do. We usually order lots of variety  and split everything.  The rice and beans looked ok. The tacos not so much. They were each wrapped in two cold tortillas. It's as if they took them right out of a package without any preparation. The tacos looked weird in those tortillas,very unappealing. I grabbed the tortillas and put them to the side.and started to taste the insides of a fish taco. The flavor and the quality was horrible. My wife was having the same experience. Neither one of us had tried the Carne  asada taco. At this point we told the waiter of our displeasure. He asked if we wanted to get something else. After waiting so long we said no thank you.",

The food is really, really good. The portions are ridiculous, and they are not afraid to toss half a pound of cheese on your plate. Of course, you'll pay for it the next day, but its worth it.   The spinach enchiladas are great, although I have no idea what that Baja sauce is, since its buried under a mountain of cheese.",

I got the chimichanga with carne asada, fajita steak, and fajita chicken. All to die for, but I preferred the carne asada.  You can pick 2 different toppings-I get double guacomole because it is fresh and fabulous. The complimentary chips and salsa are wonderful. So, why 4 stars and not 5? Because of inattentive servers on multiple visits. It is not unusual to run out of chips, salsa or drinks for a lengthy period of time. Sometimes the servers just seem to pull a disappearing act. Obviously, I like the place enough to keep going back. If you are in the Glendale area, I would highly recommend Don Ruben's, which has top- notch food and service.",

I had a shredded beef burrito with a side of beans and my wife had some sort of chicken quesadilla, but you wouldn't know any of the dishes from a saucer full of salt. Yeah, the saltiness was that bad. On top of that, my wife's food was so greasy she didn't eat more than a few bites till she lost her appetite and returned it.  The service was good; the waitress was nice and didn't give us any flak about the return, taking it off the bill. Other than her, though, this place loses; \"best place for Mexican,\" indeed.

She immediately fell in love with the food, friendly prompt service. She could not believe how delicious the red sauce was. Actually the whole plate of food. So good that she was craving Popos again. She drove from Gilbert this Friday evening so we could enjoy dinner there. Again we were not disappointed. She had green chili burrito with red sauce on top. She loved the green chili. Also got her fix of the red sauce. LOL. For a Friday night, service was prompt and friendly again. Great job Popos showing our side of town has great restaurant service and food.",

Brought chips and salsa as soon as we sat down. Salsa was very tasty and chips were fresh. Their chili con queso  was very good, thick enough to stay on your chip. Ordered margaritas which were excellent. Peach was the favorite. Entrees-beef fajitas, chicken piccado and chicken tortilla soup were marginal. Could have used more seasoning/sauce on the meats, but sides were good. Loved the rice. I would go back for chips, salsa and the cheese sauce, and of course the margaritas. Also, service is was very good and servers were extremely nice.",

I don't know if it switched owners or what, but the quality and taste of the food has seriously diminished over the last couple of years. My family and I have been coming to Popo's for over 20 years and now when it's suggested for dinner it meets a resistance it has never known. I've been holding off on this review hoping they would fix their issues, but it's become clear that won't happen. At this time, they have the worst Mexican food in Phoenix. Everything taste pre-cooked and bland. The salsa, which use to be excellent, taste like it comes from a can. I'm beyond disappointed. Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.",

I've read a number of reviews for Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, so I was excited to give it a try.   I want to start this review on a positive note.  The service at Poco's Fiesta Del Sol is amazing.  Once you are seated you're served a hot basket of chips and salsa and the salsa is delicious. I wish I could say the same about the rest of my meal.  On todays visit my lunch companion and I shared a chesse crisp, ground beef burrito with cream cheese, and a side of refried beans. The refried beans were dry and tasteless, the ground beef burrito with cream cheese  was very greasy and just didn't taste good.  I know some people seem to really like Poco's Fiesta Del Sol, but I'm just not one of them, maybe it was my entree selection",

We ended up going to Macayos and they seated us right away, please tell Frank he can have his empty restaurant all to himself, him and the three girls that just let him do this. I am certain you will lose additional business if you keep Frank employed at your restaurant. We have been coming to popos for over 30 years and have never seen Frank, please keeps him on the opening shift, he does nothing for your business, better yet enroll him some customer service classes if you plan on keeping Frank.

Also I used to go there many moons ago and eat the WONDERFUL chips and salsa and tuesday or saturday $0.99 margaritsa and walk out with a $5 dollar tab. Now you must order a combo plate or a min of 7or 8 bucks to qualify for the 99cents margarita. I usually stick with the happy hour $3 dollar margarita and chips n salsa.

The atmosphere is decent, though there is frequently a line during the busy times. They portions are humungous, I have yet to walk away without a doggy tray. Every time I go I try something new and I have yet to be disappointed. I've been to both locations, 67th and Indian School and the new one on 59th and Bell and both are the exact same food wise. My favorite thing I have tried there so far is the Machaca enchiladas. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good sit down Mexican meal!!

The neighborhood ain't great and the strip mall it's located in looks awfully scary at certain times of night, but it's definitely worth the risk.  The best days to visit are definitely Tuesdays and Saturdays, when they serve $.99 margaritas. While not the greatest margaritas in the world, you can actually taste the tequila and for $.99, you don't have much to lose. Generally, I get a chicken chimichanga or red chili burrito, both of which are solid and filling choices. If I'm heading over on a Saturday, I'll get a bowl of their red menudo, which is by far the best red menudo I've ever had. The chili has a nice kick, but overall it's a more subtle flavor than is generally found in a bowl of red. Works great as a late-night accompaniment to a margarita.  The staff are all pretty friendly and in the decade I've been going here, there hasn't really been a whole lot of employee turnover. It can be kind of a chore to get a seat on certain days, due to the customer traffic, and the parking lot is a pain in the butt, but if you're a west-sider with an appetite for Mexican food, Popo's should be in your itinerary.",

All of the previous posts about the area are somewhat accurate. It can be intimidating. Once you get past the location, the inside is inviting, the service very friendly, and the food delicious. The best news of all is we learned Popo's will soon be opening a new restaurant in Glendale at 59th and Bell Rd (near the old Costco) the first week of December. Can hardly wait to try the new place.",

I get it to go once in a while, which is a bit pricey (9.50) because at least if you eat there, you can get chips and salsa.  Not bad for an area inundated with fast food.  Not many choices.",

My burrito came greasy with no beans in it.  My boyfriends sister ordered the all you can eat tacos and tostadas. The plate came with one taco one tostada rice and beans, good size portions. She only ate the tostada and was full. Never asking for an extra taco or tostada. She asked for a to go box for the taco. The waitress server #167 Sally B. told her that since she ordered the all you can eat she can't take the taco home. So you prefer to throw it away than allowing someone who paid for it take it and eat it. Wow poor customer service. When the bill came I was charged for the beans I had already mentioned were not in there. She then removed 70 cents for them when i was charged almost $3.00 for them. Needles to say Sally did not get a tip.  Ooooh Sally that girl you just gave your restaurant a bad score. You need a class in customer service. I will never return again.",

I've seen a lot of people share a plate. Now sometimes it can be a madhouse, just the other day I heard a guy ask for a party of 30 people!! But they were accommodating, and friendly.   But no joke no matter what the wait, it's completely worth it. I love this place and while I haven't gone for the margaritas yet I hear nothing but good things about it. And one day, when I get a DD, I'm going for margaritas! Love PoPo's!!",

The whole staff worked as a team with a smile and efficiency. I even ran into a group from Nashville staying in Litchfield Park, who drove all the way from the Wigwam resort to eat here, by recommendation. Funny story is, it was their second night in a row there!! It is that good! My date had the carne asada plate and couldn't stop raving about it!

So my wife and I said ok we take that instead of regular drink we would order. Now the waitress see the drink, now we only order one meal to east tell us we can't have the drink for 1.99 b/c you have to have separate order to get the deal. We told her we wasn't told that when the server suggested the deal. She well me get my manager, so manager told us as house rule you must order two meals that it basically.

You can get better mexican food at a joint down the street for half the price, paid 70.00 for a fajitas entree, guacamole  and two kids carne asada burritos that is unacceptable! Had the food been good then the price doesnt matter but truth be told worst mexican food place I've been to in my entire life. Guacamole was bland needed seasoning and to me tasted like the bagged store bought guac. The burritos were bad meat was dry and tasted a day or two old (not an exaggeration) I felt terrible my kids were having this for dinner, as they love burritos and were really looking forward to it :( the fajitas rice and beans completely lacked in flavor. Again I am not exaggerating this, I would have been better off cooking boxed Spanish rice at home , chicken in the fajitas was dry and probably days old. Employees are useless when I directed the issue of my dry fajitas to the server he simply replied \"ok\" and walked away to get me my check haha what a joke!!! I decided to finally try this place since I was in the area and had read great reviews on yelp, makes me question how they get these good reviews either none of these people know good mexican food  or they're paying for fake reviews because theres no way on earth this place deserves 4-5 stars!!! Heck one star is even too much, please avoid this place at all costs this place does not offer quality food or service and they are extremely overpriced and overrated. I can name a few more places in the area with better food but this is not an advertisement, don't know how this place is still in business!!!!! P.s. salsa is not fresh, it is a canned salsa they pour into a bowl and overcharge you for it terrible terrible salsa.",

I don't usually comment on any dining experience but I hope someone  near and dear to the owners make them aware. I will try there other location , 59th & Bell,. C'mom POPOS DONT  fail me now!!",

    "text": "Okay... So the last time I was here was March 2016! And before than..... I couldn't even tell you... YEARS!!! Like 10+ YEARS!! My last experience before this Monday Night was not satisfying at all. Mostly in regards to just the taste of the food. Rice and beans were not very good and I believe I ordered a chicken chimichanga. (Not bad) The food was so bad for me, I had made up my mind to never return. Until now.. Which was not by Choice.   This restaurant is some of my family members favorite Mexican food spot. (Can't understand why, but it is)... And on Mondays they like to come for the all you can eat special which is All-You-Can-Eat tacos and tostadas with a one time serving of rice and beans. It's like $10! So a very Great deal. I ordered the special and you get to pick what kind of taco you want ( Chicken, ground beef, and machaca?) or a bean tostada. I order the chicken tacos because that's all I eat is chicken. They actually tasted pretty good. The chicken was a tad bit salty but not too much where I hated it. (I hate too much salt) and the rice was really good tonight. The beans were eh. And just FYI the chips and salsa are pretty good. I always base a Mexican restaurant off their chips and salsa! To drink I ordered an ice tea with extra lemon.   So now the part which has really turned me off from this place.. Lol so The check comes and without our knowledge we were CHARGED for the 3 lemons in our teas!! I asked for extra lemon with my tea, my mom did, and my brother and his gf asked for a couple on the side with their meal. Never been to a restaurant that CHARGES YOU FOR LEMON!! It added a few dollars (like 2-4 can't remember) to the bill which is not a whole lot but it would have been nice to have been told that!! We were all so shocked that they actually charge you for lemons in your ICE TEA! That's just crazy! That's like paying for all the garnish in your drinks just to make it pretty! Idk.. Kinda ridiculous when drinks are already overpriced anyways at restaurants   So this spot is just not for me.",

    "text": "I honestly don't know why people think this place is sooo amazing... lol so me and my family walk in and they tell us it'll be a 10-15 min wait. But then they sit the next 5 couples that walked into the waiting room. And after the whole 15 min we were finally seated, in a table that was empty the whole entire time. Our food did get to us fast so that was a plus! & the waitress was a little too busy to refill our drinks but it's understandable, it was a Saturday night and there was a lot of people coming in. Anyways now to the real part of this rating. They give you giant portions of bland beans, and a small scoop of bland rice, then they slop their sauce on top of the enchiladas making them look like an grease nightmare. The tacos and tostadas remind me of Del tacos food right across the street same lettuce and cheese/tomatoes with the basic hard shell not even fried or made freshly. The cheese crisp was okay, after I got a napkin and drained all of the grease and oil sitting on top of it. The only thing I found decent was their damn chips and salsa! I'm still trying to figure out why people like this place though..",

It's located in an unassuming strip of small shops, but I was pleasantly surprised by how spacious it was inside. I was nervous about the possibility of bad customer service given previous reviews, but our waiters were very friendly and attentive. You get really big cups of water, which is a big plus! There are so many food options. I chose a chicken special, while my boyfriend ordered an enchilada and tostada meal. Both were delicious. My one complaint is that the food is quite greasy, but that's to be expected based on what we ordered. I can't wait to visit again to get my next Mexican food fix!",

I just could not resist giving this place a great rating, since I credit it with making me finally fall in love with Mexican food two years after moving to Phoenix.  Finally, a place that serves Mexican food that isn't afraid to be adventurous with its spices and fresh in its ingredients.  My manager described Popo's as \"the best Mexican in the Valley - hands down\" when I asked her where to take a guest for the real deal. She hit the nail on the head.  The place is NOT perfect - if you want a so-called \"better neighborhood\" then go to the counterpart on Bell Rd. - but the food is without parallel. From the spicy cheese dip to the fajitas to the Corona-battered fish burrito....I kept waiting for something to be \"just okay,\" but as we tried each other's entrees, I could see all of our eyes light up with delight.    It gets better. Not only do they have a mean 1/2 price margarita happy hour, I saw an advertisement for 99 cent margaritas on Tuesdays.  Even without specials like this, the food is moderately priced with large portions. I have since gotten take-out from the Bell location, and \"the complete\" was more than enough to feed two people.  And, joy of joys, there are actually tasty, healthy options on the menu as well! My grilled chicken salad was AMAZING. I got a side of grilled veggies last time I got take-out, and the zucchini was fresh and cooked to perfection.  My recommendation is to ignore the pawn shop next door. Be patient if the unpaved parking lot out back is full (we ended up parking at a business up the road and walking).  Wear casual clothes. Be prepared for a slight wait if you come with a large group.    The service was right on - and THE FOOD IS WORTH IT.",

    "text": "My partner found this out of the way gem in a crappy small strip mall. Park in back.  Doesn't look like much from the outside but the nice faux finish decor and segregated dining areas on the inside make up for it.  We had the Pollo Especial and The combination Red & Green chili plates. The red chili is amazing.  I am typically more interested in chili verde but the red chili is terrific. Be sure to request corn tortillas with this plate instead of the usually served flour tortillas.  The bean and rice are great.  The rice is moist & flavorful. If you are choosing between the queso dip and the spicy bean dip, go with the bean dip it does have cheese in it with great flavor, not too spicy either.  The Pollo plate is great, it is one of the most popular dishes on the menu, however, to me the least Mexican.  Try the steak or chicken picado.  I did not try the menudo but everyone around us was ordering it, which looks delicious.  We were there on a Sunday around noon, shortly after we were seated & ordered the place began to fill up. By the time we left there were several parties waiting for tables. There is a nearby church and everyone was there following services.  So if you go on Sunday for lunch, get there by noon.  The food has incredible taste and is quite authentic.  There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Phoenix Metro as you can imagine, but there are not a lot of good Mexican restaurants.  This is a very good restaurant.  The salsa is made fresh daily & you can tell, it has great flavor (I would prefer it more spicy). Our waitress was great, smiling, attentive, and serviced well.   Next time I will order a bowl of the Red Chili with corn tortillas.  I don't need the rice and beans just a giant bowl of that delicious Red Chili.",

Of course you know to augment the tostada with shovels of chips and salsa. Si, Si.",

The portions are large and filling, the chips are 9/10 (sometimes they are not hot, but I don't poke at that much), and my mom and sister have said their salsa is amazing. We have a cop friend there that is super kind to guests by fare-welling them as he sees them as they leave. We've only had one slightly negative experience from a waiter, where one of the side ladies (not a waitress persay, just like the helper that brings chips) took our drink order and pretty much everything else in between. The waiter only saw us about 2 times during the entire dinner, to take our orders and bring them to us. I soon realized he was overworked as he was rushing all around the restraunt so I don't blame him for it. I love Popos, and highly recommend it! :)",

Only thing I've had that I didn't like was the tortilla soup- it was oily and bland the day I had it. The salsa, on the other hand, is awesome. It tastes different every time we go here, which tells me someone is making it by hand. My personal favorite is the deep-fried burrito. It is always stuffed full and piping hot. Hubby likes the fish tacos- nice fresh fish deep-fried to perfection. The last few times we've been here we've had some issues, but management has always taken care of things. It must not outweigh the good because we keep coming back!",

They have fantastic daily specials, especially on Tuesday and Saturday. Why you ask? Good Question! 1.00 Margaritas with purchase on an entree limit 4 per person. Frozen or on the rocks and they are tiny. (Granted they are not the 1/2 gallon bucket glasses but 2 of them and I am happy, 4 of them and I am time traveling!)  Now for the food. Best. Mexican. Food. In. Arizona.  I do not say that lightly, growing up in Arizona I lived in Tucson for my childhood only to move up here to where it is hotter in my early 20s. I have had my fair share of Mexican restaurants here in town, and we have ALL been to a (Fill-in-blank)bertos.  I could drink the salsa by the gallon here. The tamales are amazing, the seafood enchiladas are wonderful, and the fajitas are to die for!  They have a ton of TV's to watch sports with too.   The Bell Rd. Location is really good as well, but there is just something about this location that has be driving back down here even though the other one is closer.   I highly recommend going, and you may drive right by it if you aren't careful. Its tucked away next to a pawn shop in a strip mall on the North side of the road. (More parking in back).  Go.

    "text": "The menudo is very good. Great corn flavor not masked in Salt, highly recommend.  Husband had tacos, he wanted deep fried but carne Asada only comes in soft shell, his fault, he didn't ask. Salsa is really lame, Chunky but no taste, certainly no heat. The \"hot\" was just tomato sauce with Chile powder and salt-not a fan of either so I didn't bother with those. Still looking for a Mexican Restaurant with amazing, hot, Chunky salsa. Four stars for a great, attentive, hard working staff, nice feel to the restaurant too. Perhaps they can offer a version of salsa with Serrano and jalapenos!",

    "text": "Oh, Popo's....  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways!  having lived in the area for more than 20 years, Popo's has been and likely will always be the best mexican food around.  We worried heavily when they opened their new location at 59th and Bell because it can often signal the beginning of the end (such was the case with Garcia's).    Popo's is a family restaraunt.  A bit rough on the edges with the decor but the food and service are far more worthy of a visit than any decor.  I often look intently at the menu hoping that I would find something that could sway me from my usual choice but I somehow always seem to default to the Chimi dinner.  Sure I would love to try other items but I feel as though I would miss the chimi just a little more.  So, for me it's the chimi dinner with machaca, red sauce, guacamole, and their delicious jalapeno cream cheese.  The machaca (shredded beef) is absolutely amazing and if I could make it myself I would never have to venture out again.  Add to that their salsa (which has the right amount of saltyness and that addictive red hot sauce and you will be set for an incredibly filling and delicious meal.    The service is exceptional.  Like family really.  The beer is cold and the drink specials are always fun.  We have always had a great time and look forward to each visit.  We have tried many other Mexican places over the years but this place takes the blue ribbon.  Incidentally, we have a home in Texas as well and our Mexican food experiences there have been less than spectacular.  The TexMex - Fresh Mex idea is a completely different type of dining and it lacks the depth of flavor and preparation that Popo's is expert at.    For a south of the border treat, check it out and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!",

Which is absurd when you order to share and it comes out to well over $8 average per person. Their new business model is driving loyal customers away like myself that has been coming here for years. You can definitely see the difference since they changed the requirements. We went in Saturday during dinner time and we didn't have to wait at all. We would normally wait thirty minutes. Hopefully the \"uppers\" see that their greed is really pissing people off. It's not about the money it's about principle. Also their margaritas are so weak now!",

We had a 15-20 minute wait but it actually took 30 minutes to be seated.   As we waited even more people came in.  It was so packed that we thought, \"Damn this place must be really good\".  Our beverage order was taken and brought promptly.    The time between ordering our food and getting it was only about 10 minutes or so.  For it being so crowded I thought we'd have to wait much longer.    I ordered the chicken chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese on top with a side of rice and beans.  Yummy.  The cream cheese gives it the extra flavor that just makes the chimi oh so good.   Everything had so much flavor.  Nothing bland here.   The best Mexican food I have tasted.    The two sisters shared a plate which had, 1 toastada, 1 machaca taco, 1 beef enchilada, rice and beans.  They too enjoyed their food.  My one sister doesn't care for red enchilada sauce, however, the way Popo's makes theirs, is different.  It doesn't have that strong red flavor.  It's tones downed with something else.    Everything was delicious.  I wish we had one close to where I live.    I knocked a star off bc the staff could be a bit more friendly.  There were no friendly smiles here to be found.  They weren't rude, but not friendly either.",

    "text": "I went for the first time on a Saturday at lunch time with my girlfriend. The place was quite busy, but we were greeted and seated within minutes. Within another few minutes, staff took our drink orders and brought out chips and salsa. I enjoyed the salsa quite a bit, however I thought the chips were just ok (I can't really complain about free chips!). The staff was definitely on point with their service. Everything came out at the right time and our drinks were always full.  I ordered a machaca chimichanga topped with guacamole and sour cream. It came with a side of rice and beans (my girlfriend ordered the same). Our food came out in a good appropriate amount of time. What I mean by that is we had enough time to enjoy our chips and salsa, but not enough time to finish the salsa and wonder where our food was.  My chimi was absolutely delicious! The saying \"melts in your mouth\" is how I would describe it. I would drive out to Phoenix (I live in the east valley) just to order this again. The rice was different than I expected, (a bit spicier?), but it was good. I wasn't a huge fan of the beans, but I wasn't overly concerned since I was completely stuffed and had to take the rest home.  The interior decor is pleasant and not overbearing. There are lots of TVs playing various games, but I didn't feel as though I was in a sports bar. The exterior looks a bit run down, but don't let this fool you! This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall sort of place and I was blown away by the quality of food and service. Based on my first experience, I would highly recommend you try Popo's Fiesta Del Sol.",

Nice staff, clean enough, good service, reasonable prices, huge servings, second best chips and salsa in Phoenix.   Crappy section of town in a hole in the wall strip mall. Right where one would normally find top notch Mexican food.",

It wasn't even busy, and it took over 10 minutes before she even came to our table to get our drink order.  The food tasted like it was from the night before.  None of us got through half of the meals we ordered, and not one time did the waitress come to the table to ask how we were doing or refill our drinks.  I finally stood up as she walked past us to serve another table and asked for our check.  Only then did she ask if we needed a box or anything.  I left pretty upset.  Soon as I got in the car I asked the fam, \"what's for lunch?\".  Not sure I will be back.",

Those are pretty average and you'd be better going to Filiberto's. Their authentic dishes, however, can be really good and I must say the chips and salsa are good as well. Overall it's a decent little spot but don't go there for burritos or chimichangas.",

There was no attempt at all the clean these peppers and that was True, according to the manager. When I told the hostess she said she would tell a manager, and when she came back she was trying to hold in her laugh when she said,\" my manager said they are SUPPOSED to have seeds in them...\" So i said, \"seriously? That was her response? Can I speak with her?\" And moments later she comes up to me and says,\" our rellano's are SUPPOSED to have seeds. People like them like that. It gives them flavor! *I* like them like that. but I guess if you want it taken off, I can do that.\"  And this irritated me, but I responded by politely saying ,\"Really? Everywhere Ive had them removed the seeds and fills them with cheese before battering them, like tou would do if you stuffed a bell pepper.\" (I wanted to say, The ones at Ranch Market are to die for! Can I have my money back so I can go there and eat? But i didnt.\")  I am literally so easy to please. Ive worked in the service industry and I know how hard it can be, so I am very empathetic. Her condescending comments were unnecessary though.  Then, we finish eating and wait 15-20 minutes before were asked if we need boxes. We get boxes and its another 15-20 minutes before she comes back with the wrong checks and then disappears again. Mind you, we got there at 12:30ish and  had to wait to be seated 20-25 minutes (that was their quote) I remember checking the time at 1:17 to see if it was still lunch time, and it was, so I was happy, but I didnt end uo ordering anything from the lunch menu bevause there were only 4 options.(sad) The food actually did came out fast and was correct, (minus the ungodly amount of seeds) however we finished eating in about 20-30 minutes and sat waiting for over an hour for our checks! My sister left after 40 minutes because she had somewhere to be, but we didnt leave until 3:09pm because our awful waitress Cecelia came to our table 3 times trying to give us reciepts that were wrong. One reciept was charged 2$ too much and the other was charged $6.45 too much AND she never added our rewards points which we also asked for 3 times. Ive never had such awful service in my life! There were a total of 3 waitresses and 1 manaher that came to our table periodically yet it still took well over an hour to edit 2 orders and swipe 2 cards? We even had to get up and ask for someone twice because they just ignored us. Which im sure she ignored us because she would rather give her good service to the table of 14 she had seated next to us because their bill would be significantly larger, but between 3 waitresses, our drinks shouldnt have been empty and it shouldnt have taken more than an hour to pay.  Absolutely absurd. I'll never go back.",

The servers were talking up a storm about some folks dining and not seemed concerned with us sitting near by...luckily one server walked over and asked if what we wanted to drink. A few seconds after another server decided to break the chatter session with the other servers and cane over to ask what we wanted to drink. The first server arrived with drinks and the second one said she'd return shortly to take our order. Minutes n more minutes went by and the server didn't return...then when she remembered us, she took our order. I asked her for refills on drinks, chips n salsa to which she acknowledged by shaking her head. Minutes n more minutes went on and she suddenly appeared with an extremely hot plate, threw it on the table saying that it was very hot. I wasn't sure what to say but I did ask her silverware because we weren't provided with any...it would have been difficult to eat the excessively hot food without a fork. Keep in mind that all the time we were there...this server walked by us constantly but expressed little attention to any of our needs when it came to making our dining experience satisfactory. Back to the fork...our server appeared bothered at my request for silverware made evident by her facial expression of annoyance. The food was terrible tonight, the crusty burned beans and lack of attention to great customer service makes me seriously consider placing Popo's on my list of terrible places to eat in The Valley. I welcome anyone from Popo's to make this negative a positive but it will be awhile before I return to this establishment.  I wish to say that in the past my dining experiences with Popo's have been A+ and the service was outstanding. I would never run low on Iced Tea, salsa or chips. The food was good too!",

Fist thing I noticed when I walked into the restaurant was that everything such as carpet, walls, booths were super old. They need some serious remodeling. When I was seated I was seated near the bathroom which was the worst thing ever because it stunk really bad. When we received our food, it was not as great as the comments i read. Everything was smothered in cheese which I'm assuming is what makes the food \"Mexican\". I'm not satisfied",

Consistently good service, consistently good food, consistently clean. You can't beat the prices or the portions which are MASSIVE! The spicy is slightly Americanized, low heat, for the snow birds but just ask and they will spice it up for you. The salsa is always fresh, I mean you put it in your mouth and you think...mmmm.....fresh! The chips are delicious. I have to admit I am a creature of habit I get the same thing every time because I love it, chicken chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese and sour cream. It's da bomb!   I ate the spinach enchiladas when I went vegetarian, they are good but still not my favorite. My Mom likes the sample platter and for $11 she noms on it for at least three days it's so much food. The margaritas are strong and yummy and cheap, for $4.75 you get a very large glass and one will give you a nice warm fuzzy feeling...even cheaper during happy hour. The fried ice cream is the best, served in a fried tortilla bowl, covered in chocolate sauce, whipped cream and cherries....oooooh, I am getting hungry to go back already!  Don't ask about the one on Bell and 59th Ave. I haven't been there but Mom has and she didn't like it as much so we always just go back to our favorite in that tiny little strip mall with crap for parking...don't care....food is worth it. I'd give this place six stars if it let me, yes, I like it that much, a pleasurable experience every time and I can think of no other restaurant I can say that about.  My only regret is that I have told so many people about it over the years I'm sure that's why I now have to wait 10 minutes to get seated....LOL!",

I ordered two adult trays and one kid meal. You can't order drinks.  I thought the price seemed pricey but then again it was a restaurant order not fast food. The food took about 25 minutes (they said 15). When I got home the portions surprised me. They were pretty big sized portions. The food was good too. A bit greasy though.  We joked that it is food for someone who's got a buzz on.  Anyhow. We got good portions and the food was pretty tasty. The rating is 3 stars because when I say greasy I mean It Was Greasy!  Also the staff is kind of blah. Not really mean but I was there ten minutes waiting for food and not one server or hostess was smiling. I also smiled at a few and didn't get the return and I witnessed the hostess interacting with a waiting party and I think she could have been nicer.

The place was almost full even in the middle of the week at 6 PM. The menu is pretty big but the wait staff was very helpful in making recommendations as were the long time patrons seated next to us. Apparently they drive over 20 miles to get there and frequent the business. Ordered the margaritas and I have to say they were perfect. At first I thought they were a little weak but by the bottom of the glass I knew better. Only problem with the drinks is you can't order a pitcher.  We ordered the cheese dip for appetizer. I recommend getting the bowl (large) because the come with fried flour tortillas. Now I'm normally a big fan of corn tortillas but this was sooo tasty you got to try it. For the meal I ordered a chili relinno and a fish tacos. It was the best relinno I had in 30 years since a long ago trip to Mexico. The tacos was also outstanding, crisp fish, cool slaw  and a spicy sauce al on a homemade soft tortillas. My business part Dr had a chicken chimichanga  burrito style.  He never shuts up but he plowed through this thing without saying a word...hardly even looked up. I couldmtell from his reaction he was enjoying his meal. After another round of margaritas we left full and happy....great service and awesome food. I love this place so much I moved to the Phoenix area...wel maybe not...but I have since moved here and frequent this establishment every chance I get. Feel sorry for the other Mexican restaurants because they all get compared to Popo's.",

    "text": "When someone mentions Mexican for lunch, I just figure it's gonna be another 'berto's, but not this time! Popo's is NOT easy to find and I almost drove right by it. It's in a little strip mall on the north side of Indian School. I didn't realize there was parking in back, but there are a few in front and I was lucky enough to find one.  We got a HUGE booth! The whole place is pretty spacious and the seating is super comfy. I always ask for a booth. I don't know why, but I love a booth. I had a combo of a chili relleno, enchilada and rice and beans. Everything was fresh, if a little greasy. There was a puddle of grease under my rice, but I didn't care much because I was eating Mexican food. We got chips and salsa right as we were seated. Service was quick during out entire meal. We ended up staying after our server left (it was one of those lunch meetings with 4 people who like to talk a LOT and we had to get our tab and pay so our server could leave) and nobody gave us any hassle for staying a couple hours. I really liked the bathrooms! Super clean, without that damn southwest decor. I reallllllllly hate kokopellis and cacti and whatever else makes up the southwest theme. Hate. Blech! The prices were a couple dollars higher than what you'd normally see, but it was fine since the quality of food was really good.  Oh, and I was speaking Spanish to the hostess but apparently she didn't speak it. Whoopsie!",

    "text": "I thought this was a little secret that I was going to keep for myself, but since a few others have spilled it, I should add my review.   Popo's is a west side institution. When i needed to get my auto-brakes done, i asked someone at work where to go. They told me about a repair shop and the directions to find the place were, \"it's over by Popo's.\" It was that way about a lot of things.... They were always at the same intersection as Popo's.... or right next to Popo's.... or down the street from Popo's. When i asked what Popo's was, i would get open eyed stares.... in the community where i work, not knowing about Popo's is unthinkable.... so... off we went after work one day.   To say that the place is unpretentious is an understatement. From the outside, the place looks downright seedy. The building looks as if it is half vacant... the far end of the row of shops houses a drive through liquor store... and you get the feeling that it is that way because the parking lot is unsafe. Don't be fooled. It may look like a page out of Urban Blight magazine, but the people i have met in that neighborhood are warm, and friendly, and you are perfectly safe. I say this because, now.... when i take friends there for lunch, the usual response as we turn in the parking lot is a very leery \"Where are you taking meeeee!?!?!\"   All the looks of fear and suspicion disappear once we go in... and by the time they have had their first mouthful of fundido, they are hooked on Popo's forever.   The margaritas are huge and happy hour prices are cheap... My favorite is the frozen raspberry, or just a normal unfrozen margarita. I think I'm the minority because most of the ones delivered to my table are usually strawberry. They have a good selection of beer as well.   Of all the appetizers, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Queso Fundido... the one with spinach is to die for. At this moment, I'm drooling at the thought, and considering going there tonight. Sometimes I'll go wild on chips and have the fundido for my meal.   My favorite entree there is the seafood enchilada, despite it being made of krab vs. crab. There are many levels of dining and i consider this \"fun dining\" as opposed to \"fine dining\" so while i rarely excuse the use of fake seafood, i will make an exception here. Second to that, i like the spinach enchilada, the tacos, and almost any kind of fajita they have. I've never had their red tamales but the green ones are tasty. I've never gotten a burro but friends have... and they go back for more.   I don't know if they have entertainment every night, but last Friday they had a Mariachi band wandering through the place. It was great for my group of friends because we were having a send off dinner for a friend who is moving to Florida.... and of course, we took the obligatory photo of her with the mariachi band when they got near our table.   Popo's is great for groups. The place is fun and friendly. I've never had a bad experience there... and since it's Cinco de Mayo, i just might be there tonight.",

You can find the original popo's (There's 2 now!) on 67th ave and Indian School in a little run down shopping strip.  Please don't let the area and the looks of the shopping strip fool you. Take a chance, go in, sit down and order.  I promise you wont be let down.  The food is plentiful and the flavors are fantastic.  But beware the chips and salsa!  Often times new comers fill up on the delicious chips and salsa and have little room for their entree!  The staff is great and attentive.  There are T.Vs posted throughout the restaurant that usually have some sort of sporting event on.  If you'd like to watch a specific even (Basketball game on espn?) Just ask and they do their best to accommodate your viewing needs.  Oh and on one last note, I've never got a dish at popo's that was'nt up to my standards.   Dishes of choice:   Green Chili Con Carne Shredded Chicken Chimichanga Enchilada Style w/ Jalapeno Cream Cheese Mini Platter - Oh the Mini Platter.. Although an appetizer I often get this as main course.  Two Mini Chimichangas, Two Mini Flatas, Two Mini Tacos, Two Mini Tostadas, a Tamale (Green Corn for me), Rice and Beans.   Fried Ice Cream - Try It!!",

On our last two visits we were underwhelmed with the service and the very last time we went (only 3 days ago) the food was sub-par as well.  We know they are in the process of opening a second location and hope that this sudden decline in awesomeness is due to that situation.  Don't know, but until things improve, I'm gonna not drive out of my way to visit.  Such a pity, as this place had amazing Sonoran style Mexican food.  My favorite thing on the menu was their incredible authentic rice which was undercooked and just plain not good on Friday night.  My next favorite thing is their salsa which tasted fine but was not properly prepared (huge chunks of uncleaned peppers and big pieces of cilantro) so it was off putting.    Oh, please, will the Mexican Food Gods of Phoenix not let Popo's suffer the same failures as so many of their sister/brother mexican/american restaurants have suffered?  Seems like once they expand, the thing that made them so fantastic in the first place is lost forever.  I'm gonna go sit in the corner and cry awhile.",

There used to be a Popo's Too on the east side until it sadly closed down. My sister and I were not happy campers. But low and behold the original is still alive and well and kickin' great dishes EXACTLY LIKE THEY DID ON THE EAST SIDE! Again, consistency. The owner is always present and taking checks, seating guests and that again is an added bonus. Everything is fresh, the rice is great, unlike most places here where it's just starchy and gross and the medium salsa is always yummy. Request the hot salsa as well...it's not overly hot and quite frankly not sure why it's their \"hot\" salsa but regardless-it's deliscious. I had the El Pollo Especial except I ordered it not fried and with Machaca beef...and they were of course accomodating. The jalepeno cream cheese they top it with is well, excessive, however a little goes along way and I'll be eating the other half for dinner.   If you get the opportunity to go, go. The margaritas are also quite yummy and who can go wrong with $.99 ritas for happy hour. Just wish they were closer to Scottsdale!",

It's been explained to me that possible because it's Sonoran style is why it's so bad.  Anyways, Popo's restored my faith and taste buds.

They might have, but no one stuck their head out of the doorway and called us. Five minutes later we were seated, chips, salsa and ice water was given to us. A party of four was seated next to us. There was also a very large party of maybe 10-11 people. When the waitress came around she took orders from the four seated next to us. Then the large party, then us. It took us thirty minutes to get our food ordered, then another twenty to get it if not longer. Then our waitress would just disappear. An hour and a half was spent waiting, when the food came we asked for the to go boxes because we knew it would be another wait. I'm so glad I paid cash.

It was very tasty and seasoned well. The plate included a very generous helping of rice and beans and each had good flavor. I couldn't pass on the .99 cent margaritas which were no where indicative of the price. They were a full size. They will let you have a sample the red chili which is nice. The sauce was thick and creamy with no bitterness just lots of flavor. The service was a little slow or I'd give 5 stars. Could be because the crowds just don't stop flowing in!

Something has changed in the past few years and this weekends visit is most likely my last. The service has slipped considerably. I work in a kitchen & understand being busy, but the server openly sneered at us when we asked for my son's water refill (for the 4th time!) Other servers and the host outright ignored us. This is a systemic failure, this isn't one person or one day, they have been getting worse for years and it's finally broken me.  It's a shame because this is where we'd normally bring our out of town guests. I'll be checking yelp for their replacement.",

I now live in Chandler but work in downtown Phoenix so I will definitely become a frequent customer once again. The rice and beans are the best in the valley! I had a ground beef burro with green sauce, amazing! My friends had chimis and flautas which they also thought were delicious. My friend Michelle is a regular and swears they have the most authentic Mexican food in the Valley, I may just have to agree with her after I try a few more items :) I will definitely have to come by after work hours for a margarita! I grew up just 2 miles from here so it feels a bit like coming home :) Our waiter was friendly as well!",

Literally the most disgusting thing I ever had.  It was not even green, more like beige creamy mint, it tasted kind of tangy and flavorless at the same time.  I took one bite and left it on my plate.  The burrito was just ok, the steak was just ok.  the place is old and very dive like.  We also ordered the margaritas that everyone was raving about....NO!

Food: Shredded beef tacos - good but not great.  Menudo soup - bland broth, small amount of meat, and massive amount of barley corn.  It includes a side of lemon, cilantro, and chives, but this didn't really add enough taste to the soup.  I've had cow stomach before (in Mexico and in Taiwan) and it was much spicier and flavorful.   Drink: There was a 99 cent special on margaritas so no complaints here.   Service:  Average.   Atmosphere: The restaurant is in a small strip mall. It's pretty sketchy. There was a cop on duty in the waiting area. Other businesses in the strip mall include a pawn shop and a liquor store.   The menu also includes a note that the restaurant isn't responsible for lost or stolen items.   Pretty certain I won't be back here.",

Literally!   I got the vegetarian chimichanga with rice on the side. Inside my chimichanga has yellow squash, bell peppers and onions. I eat half of the veggie chimichanga, boom I'm full. For a large plate like that is inexpensive yet filling and satisfying.   I'm always back!",

Ordered the chorizo plate initially and when it arrived it was super salty, gritty and the refried beans had a burnt aftertaste... sent it back and got the cheese enchiladas. That was also a mistake. Again, super salty and burnt aftertaste. It was a greasy sloppy mess with oil just bubbling on the plate. Had that sent back as well and waited for the check. My husband just sat there while I sent my food back and forth waiting for me to be finished. He had a number 5 combo and he asked if he looked pale, I said why and he said he was not feeling well. We got the check and left, before we could even get to the car my husband throws up all over the sidewalk everything he just ate. Went back inside and talked to the manager (Frank) I think was his name. He said that everyone else was eating the same thing my husband ate and they weren't getting sick so he wouldn't do anything regarding our bill. He walked outside and seen my husband vomiting all over the sidewalk in front of the door and still said he couldn't do anything for us. What a disappointment.",

When we parked we thought about maybe reconsidering our decision because it didn't look quite that appealing.   Thank goodness we stayed! As soon as we walked in the yummy smell hit us. The place is simple, nothing fancy, but the food is good (we shared a sampler, which filled us both to the brim), reasonably priced & the Cadillac Margaritas are STRONG. The waitress was very nice & didn't rush us when it was closing time,,,,, it took us a while to finish those Margaritas, lol. If you have more than 1 I have 2 words for you. Designated Driver :)  Great place to come for a casual dinner or lunch with coworkers or friends. Not a place to take a date if you're trying to impress them :)  It's in a strip mall with limited parking, on some days I've heard you have to be there early to get a parking space & a table. We went late on a Friday night & had no issue with either though.",

    "text": "As visitors to Phoenix this past weekend, our group decided we wanted some delicious Mexican cuisine. We found a review for this place online and drove about 20 minutes (to what seemed like BFE) and finally arrived with hungry bellies. We were greeted by all 5 of the ladies standing near the entrance who seated us quickly. Our waitress arrived at our table quickly for our drink orders and was quite helpful.   My only complaint about the service is that my friend's father wanted to try their $4 Rita-tini (?) that was advertised on the wall that was made with 3 Amigos Tequila. When he asked for the $4 special, we were told it was strictly for happy hour. The sign itself said absolutely nothing about happy hour - and the only reason I mention this is because every other sign in the bar that offered a drink special -only for happy hour- designated that clearly on the sign. The waitress wasn't amused when he jokingly asked if she could make an exception.   Our meals were simply delicious. The carne asada was easily the best carne asada I've ever had, and being from Southern California I would like to think we have quite the selection. I personally ordered a 2 Chicken Tacos plate, which included rice and beans. The chicken was cooked differently from any other place I have ever been to, it was incredibly juicy and surprisingly flavorful.   I couldn't pin point exactly what the other people at my table had ordered, but we were all settling into food comas shortly after commencing our delightful lunch (which wasn't the best thing considering we all had a 5 hour drive to make back to California).  If I ever find myself in Phoenix again, or even somewhere remotely close by- I would definitely stop in for another meal.",

Most recently, I was considering going there for dinner tonight with a gift card I had purchased last year.  I used a small portion of the gift card last year, but don't remember how much is on it.  When deciding for dinner tonight, price is a factor so I called to find out how much is on the gift card.  They won't tell me.  They said the only way to find out is to come in and swipe the card!!!  I live quite a ways away, so that is not going to happen just to decide if we are going there for dinner.  Then, I read on the internet the cards expire after a year.  It doesn't say that on the \"refillable\" card and nobody ever said anything when I bought the card.  I am forced to assume, since they don't want me to know how much is on it, they will come up with an excuse to say it is expired anyhow.  Hmmmm....drive more than 20 miles just to take my chances?  I think not.  I guess the card will go in the trash and Popo's will go on my \"Used to go there\" list.   The food is still pretty good, but the service will prevent me from going back.",

Unfortunately I do not, and every time I come back from a scrumtious meal from you I am full of heartburn and have a tummy ache all day long :(  Okay, away from my own selfish additives, here is the low down on Popo's Mexican Food:  Popo's is located in a small strip mall, so keep you're eyes peeled because it's easy to miss! It is a classic for west Phoenix residents and has created a permanent buzz. Right when you walk in the staff greets you and serves you like the pros they are. This establishment has stood it's ground and kept a huge amount of loyals for years upon years.   The food is served in beyond generous portions. Mountains of guacamole, sour cream and meat are piled onto the dish. Beans are rice are given an extra flair with this way-better-than-average salsa and cheese. The meat is so flavorful and juicy it's sure to be remembered.  Overall, the food is really good! However, if you are not use to eating heavy portions and extra fried food, it can be a bit rough on you. I would give Popo's four stars but due to the stomach ache and heartburn I had the rest of the day afterwards, I had to deduct a star.  If you are into big and yummy meals and have no limitations on portions and fats, then this place will be you're wonderland ;)",
