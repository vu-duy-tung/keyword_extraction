I know that the area consensus is that neighboring Rudy's BBQ is the better choice, and that may be so, but Can't Stop Smokin' is a solid alternative when the lines are out the door at Rudy's. The food, from meats to sides to sauce, is consistently good, but far from the best BBQ restaurant fare I've ever experienced. Ordering is a little confusing the first time in. Just grab a metal tray and wait your turn. Some young guys with very sharp knives will walk you through it.",

Stopped in at Rudy's BBQ first (directly across the street) but there was a huge line so we thought we'd try this place instead. I ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes and Mac n cheese. The sweet gal serving up the food (on a plate on a tray - cafeteria style) told me she's bring me different potatoes after slopping some on my plate (they were runny). EVERYTHING I tried to eat was horrible! I'm not that picky but we spent $24 on food for me to throw most if it away and leave to spend more money at a nearby Paradise Bakery. I suppose now I might know why there wasn't a line at this place.   The business atmosphere itself was cool, and the kids working were sweet, but the food is something worst than that found in an old elementary cafeteria. I wouldn't feed the stuff to my dog.   Save your money and go elsewhere. Unless and until they fix their food (bland, dry, slop) we won't return.  Lots of other great eateries nearby.",

    "text": "So, I decided to stop here after being on some kind of BBQ kick and hitting up Rudy's yesterday. I wanted to give this place a shot since its right next door to Rudy's.  I don't know if its on purpose, but I think its kinda funny that their side by side.  Kind of like a gas station next door to, well, another gas station.  I came in and the place was kinda quiet. It's a sweltering Sunday afternoon and I figured people were probably at home abusing their air conditioning.  Clearly, I was the only one not doing so! Place was quiet, with quiet a few older folks eating here ahead of me in line.  It's a buffet style setup, where you go and order your food, pay, then go sit down.  They had a really good selection of choices in regards to meat selection, and I'm really happy with their sides.  I went with the brisket sandwich, but wanted garlic mashed potato's,  Me and my mashed potato's dammit!  UGH they were OUT! So, I got potato slices and a thing of corn.  Total bill was just under $10.    But here's the weird thing.  First, at the register, they offered me lemonade or ice tea...or fountain pop for a $1 extra.  I obviously went with the fountain pop for the extra dollar.  Also, kudos to this place for having a variety of sauces available at the tables for BBQ dressings.  Yes!  Also, the area where you get your supplies only has room for one tray when you go to get your pop, along with your silverware and everything else. Kind of a tight squeeze of there's other people trying to get stuff at the same time you are. Might as well put your tray down and come back for drinks and everything else.  Place is well decorated and easy to spot from the road.",

I got the pulled pork, tri-tip, and sirloin and mashed potatoes with gravy. The portion sizes were decent for the price, and the beef was very tender and well-prepared. I did not particularly like the pulled pork, but that might be more about my personal preference than their quality. The mashed potatoes were a bit bland (um. They're mashed potatoes. Aren't they SUPPOSED to be bland?) but I liked the gravy. The cornbread was very flavorful, with pieces of corn and jalapeno. We had cherry pie ($2.00 a piece? Yes thank you!) a la mode for dessert - the crust was light and flaky, and the filling was rich with whole cherries. Prefab cups of ice cream were a bit low budget, but it certainly didn't ruin the experience. The gentlemen behind the grill were very pleasant and helpful - in spite of my first-time indecisiveness - and the young lady at the register was equally friendly. I'd definitely go back or order their take-out.",

My hubby was very happy to see that they had beef ribs available but the price they charged for one (literally just one rib) was the same as you pay for a half rack everywhere else. I don't mind paying a little more at a full service place like Lucille's but if you are going to do the same cafeteria style no-frills service as the place next door, you better make sure that your food is just as good and your prices are competitive.  I see no reason to ever come here again but I added a half star for having a better choice of side dishes than a lot of other BBQ joints. I hate it when BBQ places only have coleslaw and corn, yuck! The mac and cheese and spicy pinto beans I ordered at my sides were nothing special but edible. And plus another half star for offering Left Hand Brewery's milk stout. For those of you who haven't tried it, please do so immediately, it is the most delicious beer you will ever drink. And I found out last week that it goes pretty well with barbeque!",

    "text": "BarBQ as good as any other in Arizona.    As a displaced Texan, I'm searching for some decent pit BarBQ.  Can't Stop Smokin sounded good, smelled good, has friendly helpful staff, but sadly still falls short of good Texas Bar BQ.    I've pretty much decided only a drive or flight home will satisfy my craving.  So don't think badly of the Smokin folks.     I got some sliced brisket and some sausage.    Brisket is the acid test for great BarBQ.   It should have a distinct smoky flavor and a reddish smoke ring 1/4 to 1/2 inch across.   This brisket was moist, good flavor, but had almost invisible smoke ring.   It was presliced in a steam table pan.   Sausage was a kielbasa type fine texture sausage.   Also moist but sliced to order.   I got canned green beans and fresh cooked carrot coins for sides.   Passable steam table fare.     Cornbread muffin was cakey and sweet with some whole kernel corn and jalapaneo bits.   I prefer cornmeal only cornbread.   Guess most Arizonan's like flour and sugar in their cornbread.   I'll pass on the bread next time.    Overall, I preferred the meal at Smokin as much or more than Rudy's Texas BarBQ - across the street.   The staff was definitely more engaging and helpful at Smokin.     Still searching for Texas quality BarBQ, but starting to accept its not available in Arizona.  Four stars for steam table style of service.  I'll be back with adjusted expectations.",

    "text": "I am a professional, I work crazy hours and my family loves to eat out. We eat out all the time, so ordering BBQ is a treat since BBQ delivery is quite unusual.  The initial three or four times some things were super tasty while other menu items where questionable, as if it was not cooked all the way, or the thought of \"am I even eating a real potato\" would be lingering while we ate. My honey loved the tri-tip and brisket, while my cousin would always order the sausage sandwich.  Over the last year in a half possibly more there have been times where items from our order would be missing, which was always made right my giving us a free side the next order or what not.  But after at least ordering over five times it seemed silly to keep ordering mediocre food if menu items where dissatisfying, or entirely invisible.  I'm not sure if it is being managed the same as before but for what we initially paid for, we would have more food, and literally BOTTLES of there  BBQ sauce with our order. The rolls used to be the best part of ordering but now they seem to taste like the bread my grandma would dry out to feed birds at the park.  This last time I ordered (THE last time), we ordered two double tri-tip combos, a tri-tip rib combo, and a tri-tip kids meal. There was an additional half rib which was never delivered, the delivery gentleman who I believe was the owner was cordial and pleasent- even delivering the food quickly. We realized we were missing the side of ribs and called, informing them the ribs were missing from our order and were told they would be delivered. Only to be called back minutes later and told the owner packed our order and knew they were in there.   This place is either trying to push away customers or they think they only serve certain kinds of customers with respect. Been in customer service for 10 years and that was the most ridiculous excuse for customer service ive ever witnessed. My boyfriend didn't even want to mention it because he was so done. But I called back and let them know that we will not be ordering from them anymore. Our order was $50 and I know for a fact we've ordered over $500 total from this place. Not any more! This is Tempe and is full of other places to blow that money on.  Bottomline unprofessional. #byefelicia",

    "text": "This was such an odd experience.  Have you ever eaten somewhere with some food that is AMAZING and some that is quite possibly the worse you have ever tried to eat?  If so, then you've probably already eaten here.   I went in for a quick bbq fix with average expectations judging from the average reviews. . . so I assumed that everything would be just average.  Little did I know I would be in store for some great food and some horrible food from the same place.   I had the brisket, pulled pork, corn, and garlic roasted potatoes. My wife had a half BBQ chicken, mac n cheese, and some cobbler (I can't remember the flavor but she devoured it so I guess it was good). We both opted for dinner rolls because we don't like jalapenos.   The Brisket was really moist and had a nice flavor and was probably the best I've had outside of Texas.  The pulled pork was pretty good too and more importantly meaty.  A lot of places you get pulled pork there is a lot of fat in it but not here.  I tried some of my wife's chicken and it was nice and tender with a light Smokey flavor.    But all things can't be good.  My corn tasted like it was burnt and had no flavor at all, possibly freezer burnt?  The garlic potatoes were so dry they were crispy.  The mac n' cheese wasn't very creamy and had a thick consistency, possibly microwaved?  And the dinner roll, well . . .  it was as hard as a rock and at least a week old.    Bottom line:  Go here for the barbeque, take it home, then make your own sides.  The barbeque is really good and clearly where all of the effort goes.  The sides are high school cafeteria quality.  I would guess the sides are frozen, microwaved, then kept under a heat lamp for hours, maybe even days, until it sells out.",

On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and helpful and the restaurant itself has a nice western feel to it. Unfortunately, for me and my family, the food fell a little short. I should have known when we were there at 6:00pm on Father's Day, and there was no line. I'm not a fan of cafeteria style as there's something completely unappetizing about seeing the food you're about to eat wrapped in plastic wrap. It reminds me of left overs..and I guess that's what it tasted like. But, I decided to make the best of it and give it a shot. I have no idea how long that food was sitting on the line, but I suspect it was there for quite a while.  I ordered \"Pete's Pick\" (at least I think that's what it was called) because I wanted to try a little sampling of the various offerings. Well, that's what I got.. a LITTLE sampling. The plate was literally about 2-3 bites of each meat (Brisket, Sausage, Pulled Pork) and 2 ribs. If there was more than 1/2 lb of meat total, I'd be surprised. I don't think it was worth the $16 they charge for it. I don't mind paying for good food, but I don't like getting small portions of cafeteria grade food for sit down restaurant prices.   My wife had the \"big\" tri-tip sandwich. I come from an area in California where Tri-Tip is religion (Santa Maria style anyone?) so I was looking forward to getting at least a bite of her sandwich. I giggled as I saw them slice off 3-4 really thin slices of beef (probably not even 1/4 lb.) and put it on a monstrous bun then dump sauce on it. The \"Big\" must be referring to the bun. Unfortunately, the meat was dry. And given my wife's love of tri-tip and her unwillingness to finish the sandwich, I decided to pass on asking for a bite and took her word for it that it wasn't good.  My son ordered a two meat combo. I don't know if the guy behind the counter was attempting to be funny or if he was serious, but when my son asked for chicken, while looking at a whole pan full of it, he was told they didn't have any and wouldn't have any for about 30 minutes. I guess they didn't want to cut up any of the whole chickens that were sitting there (must have been at least 4 whole chickens there) My son just shrugged and went with the Baby Back Ribs and Sausage. He's a pretty laid back kid. He ate one rib...he NEVER eats just one rib. Unfortunately, the ribs were dry and tasteless if you didn't add sauce. It's disappointing when I know I make better ribs than the BBQ restaurant does.  In general, the meats were dry and/or flavorless. The brisket was moist, but how could it not be with all the fat that was in it? A smoke ring was non-existent. The sausage was bland and completely forgettable. The pulled pork wasn't too bad, but nothing to write home about. The sides were all pretty bland. The baked beans tasted like they came out of a can. Potatoes were bland. Cornbread was dry.   I'm not sure if I'll go back to this place or not. I may give them another shot after they've been open long enough to work out the kinks. I hope they see these reviews and make some changes in how they prepare the food. It could go a long way, especially with another BBQ joint just across the street. The food is my only knock on this place, but unfortunately, the food is the biggest reason I go to a restaurant.",

I ordered the brisket which was moist but it didn't blow me away.  Their BBQ sauces on the table were only okay.  Nothing spectacular.  Where I'm really disappointed with this place came to the sides.  I had the worst mac & cheese ever from here!  It had zero flavor whatsoever!!  I also had mashed potatoes with gravy which was also bland as can be.  I will NOT come back here unless they improve and they give me a free meal to give them another chance.  I would NOT recommend this place and I'm going to give Rudy's across the street a chance to see how they compare to this dump.",

    "text": "So my husband and I are always on the look out for new BBQ joints, since hes from Memphis TN its always hard to find something decent. HIs parents went to Rudys across the street in the past and said it was terrible, so we thought we'd check out 'cant stop smokin' bbq'. We pulled in to a barely empty parking lot. We went inside and we greeted immediately by the hostess and she explained the style of ordering and seating of the restaurant. We order off a line like cafeteria style - you pick you meat- your sides - your drink, and then you pay at the end and sit wherever you like. I decided I was going to go for the #4 combo with 6 st louis style ribs and i chose macaroni salad and cole slaw, a slice of apple pie  and a lemonade. My husband chose the combo Pete's Pick which comes with 2 baby back ribs, smoked sausage, brisket, pulled pork and he added carnitas and his sides were mac n cheese and cole slaw and a sweet tea.  Both of us also got the jalapeno corn bread. Now my husband and I have had our fair share of BBQ, and i will say that this was by far the one of the worst bbq we have ever had. My meal was absolutely gross. The st louis ribs were clearly not fresh, they were completely falling off the bone and completely fatty and flavorless. The macaroni salad tasted like gross store bought macaroni salad and the cole slaw tasted like a horrible version of the KFC cole slaw. I thought the lemonade was supposed to be fresh they had tropicana lemonade which is nasty so i decided to taste the so called sweet tea.. the tea was watered down and didn't even taste sweet. And the corn bread was dry. My apple pie tasted like store bought apple pie as well. My husbands food was just as bad. Brisket, baby back ribs, pulled pork, and sausage all flavorless. he too thought the cole slaw tasted like a bad version of KFC's and the mac and cheese tasted like it came from their too.  If you are looking for a good BBQ place 'cant stop bbq' is not the place for you. And if any of you reading this review thinks that this place is good bbq your crazy and you obviously haven't had the real deal yet. Frankly if you are looking for a great st louis rib check out Loucilles BBQ at Tempe Market Place or even at Dave's BBQ.   Also i think its hilarious if you check out their website that all of the reviews are fantastic and they are rated at a 98% by the customers, but if you go to the internet reviews like yelp or urbanspoon you are getting realistic reviews.",

I absolutely love Beef Ribs, and as those of you who live in the Phoenix metro area know, they are hard to find here.  I ate at Can't Stop Smokin' on opening day, and the ribs were not bad at all, Expensive, but pretty good.  We ate there again 2 weeks ago, and the ribs were charcoal with absolutely no taste.  Burnt to a crisp!  I should have returned them, but had had a big day and didn't want to cause a scene.  I ate one of the two ribs and threw the second one away.  It was terrible.  I left a review on their web site, but they apparently don't care because I never heard back from them.  I will never eat there again.  Rudy's is out because they don't serve Beef Ribs.  I guess my quest continues.",

I did like the building, as it was all carved wood and made me feel like I was up in the woods, but it also had an elderly vibe to it. Rudy's across the street seemed a lot more lively.

    "text": "This place is destined to fail.  I have to agree with the other negative reviews, and I wish I had read them before we came here.  It is built right next to another barbecue place, so inevitably they are going to be compared.  Rudy's wasn't very good, but it's way better than Can't Stop.  So why would we ever come back?  My wife and I ate here tonight, and $21 later, about half of our food was in the trash.  As others have said, the food is bland.  There's not much to say.  We got a few different kinds of meat, a few different kinds of sides... nothing worth talking about.  The service was horrible.  When we first walked in, people were looking around confused, because they had no idea where to go or what to do.  Finally a rude girl came up and told the older couple in front of us that they could sit anywhere, and handed them some menus.  They wandered off not knowing that it's cafeteria style, and the line was right around the corner.  I wonder if they ever got to eat anything.  After the rude girl's (seriously, who hires someone like this and puts her out front?) useless, condescending explanation to us, we waited in line.  Two people in front of us and we still had to wait about five minutes.  The people working the counter are not very well trained.  I know it's a new place... but come on, it's been a week.  Get your act together already.  Oh, and I just read in other reviews that the sauce is kept warm (ours wasn't??) and you can put a wooden nickel into a bowl or something for charity??  None of this was explained, and I didn't see it happen.  Oh well.  Guess we still have to drive to Joe's or Famous Dave's to get decent barbecue.",

I would definitely go there again when in the area. The service is cafeteria style, grab a tray and pick out what you want - typical BBQ.  the decorations were also typical BBQ so it was comfortable.

It is also nice that I can order my meal as a combo rather than have to order my food by the pound.  The BBQ was great here.

The ribs are flavorful and have the right smokeyness to them, and I don't know if I got lucky one day but the smoked turkey leg(which is my main reason to travel to the renaissance fair every year) was amazing! I probably eat here once or twice a week and the workers know when I walk in that I'm getting a full link of sausage for my son and they always cut it up for him (he's almost 2) which is one of the main reasons I will not step foot in rudys. I will give five stars for the meat and customer service alone, BUT there is major room for improvement here and that is the sides. They are sometimes seasoned well and sometimes bland. I feel like they personally need more variety and flavors on the sides, maybe a creamed corn or spinach? In my mind the meat is the centerpiece but people remember side dishes!

First impression was it's a clean, nicely designed, restaurant with heavy timber decor and metal baking sheets for trays.  Second impression was \"who lets their brisket sit in a steamer pan floating in water??\"  Coming from 7 years in OKC and 22 years in Dallas, no self-respecting BBQ vendor presents their brisket floating in water.  Plenty of sides, a'la cafeteria style, and that was cool, but asked the guy behind the counter to lean out the brisket for me, since it had plenty of fat on it, and didn't do a very good job.  You see, I HATE fat.  Anyway, the smoked sausage was pretty good, but they had no fried okra, which where I came from is a BBQ house staple.  They did have sweet tea, which I am fond of.  Anyway, the gal at the cash register was pleasant enough, but it doesn't make up for the flavor of the brisket (interesting, if you let your brisket float in it's own fat juice, it ends up tasting like fat!)  So, for me, this is not a place I will return to . . . just wasn't my cup of tea.",

The ribs were literally fall off the bone, mashed potatoes were definitely not any type of packaged or frozen potatoes, and the carrots were steamed to perfection. Hubby ordered kielbasa sausage, mashed potatoes, and macaroni & cheese. He was super pleased with everything and was happy to see the portions of meat they give you. Let's just say they aren't shy with the portions.   We were a little nervous at first because the place wasn't very busy but it should be packed based on the experience we had. Like I said the food was to die for and the customer service was very wonderful. It's not your average restaurant so they walked us through the entire process.

While this restaurant serves up decent offerings, it is hard for me to consider it BBQ since the flavor, smoke, and sauce or rub is extremely lacking. Even their side dishes were very bland. It's like what Taco Bell is to authentic Mexican food. This is BBQ for the masses, non complex, safe, and average. The sausage has no char or snap, the ribs have no smoke or flavor. You have to dump sauce on the meat to get any flavor.   The price point is ok and the service is good but it just wasn't a memorable experience.",

We got a Groupon deal for the picnic platter thing that had 2 lbs of meat total, 3 sides, and even got free cobbler since it's free on Fridays...LOTS of food. We got pulled chicken, beef brisket, pork sausage for mains; beef brisket was good, had a nice smoky flavor. Chicken and pork sausage were okay, but really needed salt or something. The sides were lackluster (mashed potatoes, mac, and baked beans), but the beans were really super-bland. Toss some molasses in 'em, guys! We got corn bread that seemed like it was a \"third-party\" corn bread they had heated up. The barbecue sauce at their condiment station is not so good, either; came home and put Trader Joe's KC sauce on the leftovers, made it so much better. The cobbler was nice.  I was impressed with how nice and helpful all the staff was, especially the girl who did our order; I imagine she gets tired of going through how it works numerous times each day, but she was peppy and explained things like she was super-interested. The confusion is that they have \"premium meats\" that they upcharge $4 for, which is disappointing but I guess makes sense (The premium ones are bone-in stuff like ribs and tri-tips).  Atmosphere is nice, very homey.",

The bbq chicken flavor was below average. The corn on the cob waa good. The mashed potatoes were peppery and not edible. Brisket was tender but had a below average flavor; too smokey.",

The brisket and pulled pork were good, but I wish they also offered a Carolina-style vinegar based sauce to go with the pulled pork. The sausage casing was tough rather than crispy or snappy, and the carnitas are awful. (There are many places in PHX that served real carnitas--these weren't even close.) The mustard greens were great, the slaw was just ok, and the cornbread muffin was atrocious. (I'm from the South, so I know good cornbread.)  The other issue I have is that the board listing their to-go BBQ \"by the pound\" is a bit misleading. You have to read the small print to realize that the prices listed are actually for just a half-pound. When I pointed that out to the employees, one of them just said, \"Well, the owners are German.\"  As if that explained everything ( well, I guess it does explain the terrible carnitas and cornbread?) I probably won't eat here again. It's not good enough for me to get excited about revisiting.",

Food was also room temp, which didn't help. To conclude I wouldn't come back.",

The first time we went we got Pete's Pick, which is a $15 combo plate. But if you want to try a lot of different choices, this is the item to get on the menu. The staff was very friendly and helpful when trying to choose different items. The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that their bread is not warm, most their food is not piping hot. But if you care about flavor not about the hottest temperature wise food, you can't go wrong here. The second time we went there, my girlfriend and I got the four-person picnic deal. We ate about half the food there, and took the other half home. Which ended up giving us about three more meals when we get home.",

No hostess to greet or give direction or guidance to first timers.  Dislike.  It started out a tad confusing.  The method in which you order is almost like a cafeteria.  Kinda like Souper Salad or Bonanza (remember Bonanza?)  Seems awkward.  Maybe that's because of the service that was behind the counter. Came here for linner  (late lunch/early dinner) and we both went with the #3 combo.  Carnitas and tri tip, mustard greens, jalapeno corn bread, corn on the cob, and peach cobbler for me, sausage and Carnitas, green beans, jalapeno corn bread, corn on the cob, and blackberry cobbler for my son. Method used to weigh meat was questionable.  Both Carnitas and tri tip had too much fat on meat.  Corn was soggy. Other veggies were mediocre. Son wanted to leave as soon as we were done eating because he said he smelled formaldehyde.  I know a few friends like this place better than the competition across the street but that's fine with me cuz that just means fewer people in line to order -at Rudy's.",

The counter employees will let you sample the different menu items to help you decide what you'd like to order and take the time to explain the different options to you. The food itself is very reasonably priced, and the portions are huge-- I always leave stuffed. I frequently hear people rave about how Joe's or Rudy's has the best barbecue, but I've tried Joe's and my husband tried Rudy's, and we weren't impressed. CSS has good meats AND good sides, and in my eyes, if your restaurant doesn't have both, you don't have a leg to stand on. I'll keep coming back to CSS for my barbecue fix.",

The two BBQ sauces were mediocre at best.  They didn't have that addicting \"I can't get enough\" flavor.  The turkey breast was slightly better but it was very clear it had been brined as the saltiness of the meat was distracting.  There was a hint of pink indicating that smoke is actually used in their cooking although you couldn't taste it.  Two stars because the restaurant was very clean and well decorated for a BBQ joint, but that alone is not enough to make me return.",

Then a young man comes out with a hot dish for behind the counter. The three people told us to go ahead and even my mother and I were indecisive, being a first time as well. My mom got the Pete's special (one meat, side and chips for $3.99), I said I wanted the same think with the carnitas. He asked me what two sides I wanted and I said, shouldn't it be one side and chips, and he said no it's two. Oh okay, so I got green beans and potato salad. Apparently there is a Pete's Lunch Special for $3.99 and a Lunch Special for $6.99. For the price you do get a large portion, my mom enjoyed her turkey, I wish I felt the same about my carnitas. It was not pulled as I would have expected in a BBQ place, it was cut in hunks. I took a bite and apologized to my mother that I could not eat it. It was tough and fatty. She insisted that I take it back up to the counter and ask for another meat choice. I opted for the brisket which was much better. Two people could definitely share the $6.99 special. There did appear to be a manager there fidgeting with the tvs. I would have expected that he could have walked around asking people how they were doing.   Suggestions:   Shred up the pork, your customers will be happier!  Manager, walk around and greet people, especially when you enter the place or have a host/ess there for some guidance!",

I tried Rudy's in the past and thought it was pretty good.  Then I saw a deal chicken for this new place (two meals valued at $24).  Went there for lunch,  got my food,  and at the counter the cashier guys behind the counter realized that my deal chicken was actually for a different restaurant.  I felf like a dumb ass, but they said I was all good, and enjoy the food anyway, on them.   Now that is what I call excellent customer service.     Very nice decor,  definately upscale for a bbq place,  with natural wood tables and TV's in the back room.  Everything was nice and clean.  People there were very friendly.  For the food, I had the hot links,  which smokey, tasty and juicy, and were excellent,  and the brisket,  which was moist and tender, though it did seem to have a spice rub on it which would impart more flavour.    I also had a side of corn on the cob,  which was a little small, but the corn was sweet and tender,  and the potatoes,  which were sliced big like wedge fries,  but tasted more like a baked potatoe in that they were soft and not crispy.    I also had the collard greens and green beans which were very simple, but tasted good. Not spicey or smoky.  They have two sauces,  one that is spicey,  which had a little heat,  and good flavour,  and a plain one that I did not try. Good portions of the meat and sides (except the corn).    There were some smoked turkey legs that looked amazing, that I would like to try on my next visit.   And the pies look like they were made from scratch.  I will have to try those next time as well.  Overall,  with the nice decor,  excellect service, and good food and portions,  I will definately be back to try them again.",

I felt like cattle in a line to get my food. However when we went to Cant stop smoking the chef Allen treated us amazing. He allowed us to try all the different meat and explained everything to us. He was very patient and the food was GREAT!!! The sauce was real BBQ sauce and Allen even came up to us in the end to make sure we enjoyed everything. Loved it and will be back",

Rudy's is always busy, Can't Stop you pretty much can walk up and order from.  The Service has always been nice.  But that doesn't make up for the food The food and counter were you order reminds me of a hospital cafeteria.  And most of the sides taste like they came from a hospital cafe.    The meats are ok at best.  My favorite is the carnitas.  The brisket was blah and pulled pork ok.    Ambiance is fine.  Plenty of open seats...again not a good thing per say.  I don't see this place lasting another year.",

    "text": "I never do a review on here but had too.  Please don't mistake this place for Rudy's next door.  I sent my co-workers to pick-up lunch and they accidently went to this bbq joint instead. The turykey sandwhich was very dry store bought bread and all. I gave them $8 which across the street would have filled me up w/ a sandwhich and side for green chili. The register lady didn't even tell them they were at the wrong place when asking for creamed corn, she said they didn't have it today(they never have it). The pork was dry and tasteless. The soda was flat. The beans were chalky and dry. The bbq sauce taste store bought or a dipping sauce from fastfood place. I really tried to like somehting from this place but even the soda was flat my co-worker said. They told the lady it was their first time( since it was) and she said um ok. Next door they would have given you a platter of samples. Free what's that?  At least if you are going to charge 8$ for a few pieces of meat on dry bread through in some veggies or something.  Never in my life...I cannot understand why this place is still open other than it is family owned so people are supporting them out of the kindness of their heart.  Definently do not quit your day job and eat next door then take notes.  Your food has more flavor just not the heart and soul of a \"Real\" family owned and operated bbq restuarant.  #icouldmakethisathome",

    "text": "I've been wanting to open a yelp account for quite a while and after reading the reviews about CSS, I was compelled to do so.  I'm confused about the low ratings as my experience has been just the opposite.  I've been to CSS at least 4 times since it opened.  Each time, the food and service has been great.  I've  had the brisket, smoked turkey, smoked chicken, tri-tip, and sausage.  The smoked turkey is possibly the best I've ever had.  Juicy, tender, moist....I get the 2 mean combo which also comes with corn on the cob, 2 sides, choice of cornbread or bisquit? (I get the cornbread), and iced tea or lemonade.....all that for less than $10.  Of the sides available, I've had the green beans, chicken salad, jalapeno beans, and mustard greens.  I thought they were all very tasty!  I've only tried the spicy bbq sauce, which was also very tasty.  It was my first time for mustard greens...definitely a uniqe taste...a texture similar to spinach but a hint of sour taste....I'd have them again!  The ambiance of this place is very cool.  I love all the workwork.  It's very clean and comfortable.  The only complaint I have is regarding the beverage area.  The lids for cups are at the register and straws are by the filling station....had me hunting around for a lid the first time I was there.  The staff have all been friendly, the food is very good, the prices are good.  Overall, my experience has been very good.  I'd give 4 1/2 stars if I knew how?  Good Eats, B  Update:  I just learned that my review was filtered???  I'm not sure what's up with that, but I assure you, Yelp, that this is a legit review.  Yelp, I give you 1 star for this  LOL",

But we decided to stay and try this place.  I wasn't sure what to order but I was able to try each meat before I made my decision. The hubby and I decided to go with the two meat combo,  which was $10.49 and included a drink, corn, a roll,  and two sides.  I got the tri tip and boneless pork shoulder and the hubby got the beef brisket and shredded pork. I had the loaded mashed potatoes which were tasty but a little too salty for me. The corn was really good along with my jalapeno corn bread. The meat was okay. Now I'm not much of a BBQ person but the hubby is so that's why we chose it. He loved everything on his plate (baked beans and mashed potatoes) and was done way before I took my third bite (so it seemed). He said he would eat here every week if he could.  The employees were very friendly and helpful and made our first experience there a good one.  Just not as crazy about bbq like he is but it's a good place to check out.",

Cornbread like sawdust. I'm not a picky eater but I threw most of it away. The only reason I gave 3 stars is I got the peach cobbler in order to meet the minimum delivery and that was amazing I give them that they can make a good dessert also delivery was very fast so that's a plus but I do live right across the street so that probably had a lot to do with it I definitely won't be back though",

    "text": "We're big fans of Can't Stop Smokin' because they have some of the best BBQ in town.  That Rudy's place across the street has nothing on CSS, well, except for maybe good customer service.   We took advantage of the Groupon deal for dinner on 1/24/19.  I expected the typical walk in, wait to be served, select meats/sides, pay and get out the door within 10 minutes or so.  First of all, I think something must have happened before I walked in - perhaps the jerky manager chewed everyone out minutes before - who knows.  All I know is that the people working were frowning, quiet and moving as slow as molasses, and there was a heavy negative vibe that hung in the air which could be felt from the second you walk in.  UGH.  It took me 26 minutes to wait, select food and pay - and there were only 2 people in front of me.  The manager was right there the whole time, with his head buried in one of the cash registers trying to \"help\" a new girl take a catering order, much to the dismay of the 6 people waiting in line to pay.  He glanced up, demanded to one brunette employee to come over and help (to which she ignored) and looked back down again.   The only saving grace was Kayla, who apparently can do it all, from preparing the food in the back, to serving customers and cashiering.  She saw the problem and jumped in to take care of EVERYONE that the manager ignored. She was also the only one in the place who could even muster a half-smile.  Hats off to her!  Like I said, we love the food and come here regularly (even bring out-of-towners here), but this experience soured me.  We might come back and if we do, if there's even a hint of the same vibe going on when we walk in, we'll turn around and never come back.",

    "text": "First time at Can't Stop Smoking BBQ. Dropped in on a Saturday around noon. There were four people eating in this huge place. Hmm, not a good sign.   There were plenty of options so I chose them all!  I got a sampler plate (#7 on the menu) that came with pulled pork, pork ribs, brisket, sausage, two sides and choice of bread. I got Mac N Cheese plus coleslaw and a jalapeno cornbread muffin. It was $16.   The only way to break this down is to rate each item. Pulled pork: 4 stars; ribs: 5; brisket: 5, sausage: 3, Mac: 5, slaw: 5, muffin: 4. Value: 4. Nothing was 'bad' but some were more bland than others, like the sausage. The pulled pork, sausage and cornbread were about as good as what I make on my Weber at home. The rest of them were better than mine (Mac was way better!)  The atmosphere was very teen-centric, as was the cafeteria setup. Something can be said for a long line winding past a worn butcher block with a pit master working the knife and fork. None of that here.",

    "text": "We had bought a Groupon for a BBQ picnic package and since we were on that side of town yesterday we decided to go ahead and use it for takeout to bring home. Let me say -  I was really impressed! We ended up getting a pound of brisket, a pound of pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, garlic potatoes, and peach cobbler. It also came with bread so we opted for half jalapeno cornbread and half dinner rolls. It was a good sign when we pulled up in the middle of the day and the parking lot was full of cars. Since we had Breann, our dog,  with us hubby waited in the car while I ran in to get it. The inside of the place is awesome with wood furniture and Western decor throughout. You go down the line and pick what selections you want and they build your plate while you watch.  I was really impressed with the fact that they weighed everything. So I knew that the pound of brisket or pulled pork that I received was really a full pound because I was able to view the scale when they sat each on it. The meat was very tender and not at all fatty or gristly. The smokiness was definitely evident and no sauce was even needed although I did slather it with their original sauce which had a sweetness to it that I really enjoyed. All of the sides we received were very good however I think the macaroni and cheese was my favorite! The noodles were firm and the cheese was thick and creamy, just the way I like it. The jalapeno cornbread was very good and not very spicy at all. The peach cobbler had a little tartness to it and not too sweet. Perfect for the dollop of ice cream we topped it with! I also really appreciated the fact that they wrapped everything in saran wrap individually for transport. Not only did it not make a mess in the car but it also kept in the heat so when we got all the way back to the west side of town things were still pretty warm. Everyone was very friendly and made sure to make me feel welcome. We will definitely keep this on our list of go to places whenever we find ourselves on the east side of town again.",

The sausage is alright, brisket is pretty good, but the pulled pork is FANTASTIC. It tastes like camping, it has an amazing smoky taste that seriously makes me feel like I'm sitting around a campfire at night in the woods.  The mac n cheese is pretty good too, it's got a good thick homestyle consistency. The garlic potatoes are pretty good but next time I'll try something else. The blackberry cobbler... Oh man. It was so hard to put down, it was hot and fresh and delicious. I was going to give my leftovers to my boyfriend when he got home from work but he might not find out that there was cobbler if he doesn't get home soon.",

I've been devouring the stuff for 60 years now, from South GA, to Tenn, to Kansas City, to Dallas Tx, to Oakland Ca, and all points in between. So believe me when I say I know good BBQ.  I tried 'the-other-place' on 3 occasions based on reviews and just couldn't figure out what the big deal was. Finally, after a craving, I tried Can't Stop Smokin... and I was like YEA this is it.   The tell-tale sign of a good joint is the pulled pork. If they can't do pulled-pork right then that's a sign the rest is lousy as well. I thought the pulled pork was good - coupled with the regular sauce it tasted great. I didn't like the 'hotter' version of the sauce...  Went back again for a Brisket sandwich - very good, not like shoe-leather across the street.  Tonight I sampled a 1/2 rack of ribs - excellent.  This is good stuff folks - trust me, I got 60 years of experience backing up my statement.",

It was amazing how they were able to remove so much flavor from the end product. I don't know how they managed to pull it off.  The tri tip and mashed potatoes could both be described as just okay. Neither impressed, and I ended up dousing a healthy amount of bbq sauce on the meat in order to enjoy it.

Yet with that uniformity comes time tested (and test lab) food tastes, that makes us come back for more -- no matter which city or town we find ourselves in.   But if you are tired of the \"same old, same old\" as I am, you keep your eye open for these places. Don't get me wrong Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ isn't perfect, but it's a nice change.   Last night I ordered their Combo Dinner.  That's two specialty smoked meats, two sides, a soft drink and your choice of breads. I went with the Brisket, smoke polish sausage, garlic mash, apple cobbler and jalapeno corn bread for $10.99. They do the same thing for lunch at $7.99.   I found Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ \"A-Okay\" and Three Stars good. The meat had a nice smokey taste that lasted after my meal, while the sides were little bland and the corn bread had no kick. BTW, what's with all this 4 Sq signage? I didn't even know they were still in business. LOL",

I'm guessing the cooks prepared to much food for lunch and let it sit on the cafeteria line for dinner. We tried to eat the following: Baby back and ST louis ribs, both were dry and tasteless. The pulled pork was not editable. We saw the manager add water to the pan to breath life into the pork. It didn't work. The tri tip was over cooked. The brisket tasted like bad pot roast and it had a green tint to it. The sausage was tasteless. The corn bread muffin was so so. The Mac and cheese was bland.   Honestly we had high hopes for this restaurant but after spending $60 for three of us and dumping most of the food in the garbage, we won't be back.   My one suggestion to the manager, don't cook so much ahead of time. After the food sits out for hours really how can it be fresh and good.",

    "text": "My order: brisket, smoked sausage, potatoes, jalapeno beans, jalapeno corn bread, berry pie.  Total for order: just over $13.   Portions:Small (especially for a bbq place)  Sauce: Bland, typical. What you would find in a bottle in a grocery store. Even the spicy was not good at all.   The food: The brisket was a complete disaster. I did the pull test to see if it was cooked properly. A properly cooked brisket will be slightly elastic, but will pull apart when pulled. This brisket pulled apart with no give whatsoever. Overcooked. The flavor of the brisket, well, was nowhere to be found. No smoke ring, no smoke flavor, no real seasoning to be tasted. I have had better brisket made in an oven. I wonder if this brisket really spent any significant time in a smoker...   The sausage was average, nothing special at all. Again, no smoke flavor to be found.  The sides: the potatoes were good. The beans were good. Neither was amazing, but I ate them happily. The jalapeno cornbread was nasty. It lacked any taste besides jalapeno. Very bland.   Desert: The pie was actually really good. I would come here to get a whole pie in the future. I am serious, the pie here was quite good.   Comments: The staff was really nice and seemed to stand behind their food. However, their positive and welcoming attitude did not make up for the fact that this BBQ is weak. I cannot give them another chance, because for the prices they charge I cannot risk another meal of this caliber. Besides the pie, very disappointed and I would never eat here again. Too bad, their staff was really nice...",

    "text": "I would have to say the best thing about CSS is the interior.  Very well done and offers a great ambiance.  The food on the other hand was rather disappointing.  I tried the Brisket, Spare Ribs, Sausage, potato salad, mac and cheese and corn bread.  For the most part everything was pretty bland and lacked a good smoke flavor.  The brisket was moist but no ring which leads me to believe it was put on the smoker to give it some color but then was taken off and wrapped and placed in an oven.  The sausage had a good smoky color and flavor but the spices within the sausage were nothing more than you find in a store bought sausage.  My sides were overall bland and the corn bread was very dry.   I was able to try some samples from my friends meals and I would say the beef rib was very well done and tasty.  The pie was also very good.   The food is served cafeteria style which is difficult for me to get past, It lends itself to questioning how long ago the food was prepared.  Also I did not get a strong smell of smoke inside the restaurant.   Overall I think CSS would be a viable BBQ option for the area if they were not located right next to another BBQ joint.  They have stiff competition and currently are lacking in the flavor department by a long way.",

The delivery guy called me 9 minutes after the scheduled delivery time stating he was outside my room.  I opened the door and no one was there, I asked if he was at the right place.  He hung the phone up on me and showed up to my door 6 minutes later.  He was a Cant stop smoking employee (wearing company shirt), and delivered my ice tea which was spilled over, and two trays of semi warm food.  I also ordered a peach cobbler which came in a plastic cylinder container.  It was the medium size cobbler and it appeared they stuffed in the the container.  It did not resemble anything like a cobbler, instead it looked like peach barf.  Worst part about it, no silverware.  I contacted CANT STOP and they said they will deliver utensils to me.  So far it's been 14 minutes.  The food is getting colder, I am getting hungrier, and the utensils are MIA.",

Everything we got to eat had the perfect amount of smoke, most places in the area are so smoky it's hard to eat this place nails it.

    "text": "First off, BBQ is about meat and when it comes to smokey, BBQ meat, these guys know what they are doing.  I ordered a combo plate with ribs, because when first visiting any BBQ place, always judge by the ribs.  Ribs are hard to fake, because there isn't much there.  Their ribs are divine.  They don't fall off the bone, which is a sign of overcooking, but they pull away from the bone with gentle ease, which is a mark of a great rib.  They also have the characteristic pink hue to the inner meat, which is another hallmark of proper BBQ.  Now, I'm not a big BBQ sauce person and usually prefer my BBQ with a nice dry rub, and I can't attest to their BBQ sauce, but their meat had a divine smoky quality that was an excellent complement to the baby back ribs natural pork flavor. The dry rub had a nice bit of flavorful spice to it without being more that just a suggestion of heat on the tongue.  The price seems just a tad bit on the high side, but not so that you feel like you were roughed up too much.  This is place has a sort of deli style counter that you walk up to and tell them what you want.  They sell most of their product by the pound (or fractions of), like a deli would of sliced meats, but they do have some pre-designed plates to choose from.  After you get your food, you pay at the register and either take it to go or sit in their very rustic, wood-accented dining room with a reasonable number of TVs on sports.  They have lots of drinks to add to your meal, including sweet tea, and the bottled craft beers (and other mas produced swill) were very reasonably priced. The only negative that I can point out about this place is the sides.  The greens were straight out of a can and very unremarkable and the mashed potatoes (even the loaded version) were straight out of a box (think potato buds).  While the loaded mashed potatoes were accented with some spinach, garlic, and some other flavors, it wasn't enough to hide that instant mashed potato flavor.  However, I stick to my first comment in this review, that BBQ is all about the meat and this place is right on target with that and cooked by an experienced hand.  Go for the meat, have a beer, watch some sports and enjoy!",

I should have turned around and left when I saw the ribs were wrapped in plastic sitting in heating trays, along with the other menu items.  But hey, don't judge a book by its cover, right?  WRONG!  The collard greens were overcooked, and so vinegary that they were inedible.  The Mac and Cheese.....well, KRAFT does a better job.  It was watery and bland.  The Tri-Tip was way overcooked, dry and the best thing about it was the fat.  The jalapeno corn muffin was dry, brittle, and did not taste good at all.  The Baby-Back Ribs were edible, barely.  95% of this meal went into the garbage.  As I left there at 1:00pm I noticed there were only 4 other customers seated in the restaurant.  When I drove past Rudy's I could not help notice there was a line out the door.  If the meal was free I would not eat there again.",

Baby backs were too dry and not cooked slow and long enough; thus, bones would not come off easily. Very disappointing as I was looking forward to trying this place out. Tried tri-tip per employee's recommendation but it was way too dry for my liking. I can cook way better than this place in my Green Egg. If you are a fan of brisket, I would recommend this place.

    "text": "Can't Stop Smokin BBQ is directly across the street from Rudy's BBQ which is really good. Probably one of the best chain BBQ's here in Phx...Not sure if the folks who opened this place knew that was going in there when they opened this place. If they did, then that was a poor marketing decision. Can't Stop's  decor is kinda cool. Has a log cabin/lodge feel to it. The booth I sat in was in need of major repair to the seat cushion. All the wood blinds and light fixtures are looking like they've never seen a duster. The place was not busy and yet almost every table looked like it needed to be cleaned. The employees all seem to be college or high school kids, nothing wrong with that. They were all polite and knew their stuff. After all that, let's get to the food! My husband and I both got the lunch combo special, sandwich, chips or side dish and a drink for 6.99. Not a bad deal. Good portions. However, maybe our choices weren't the best ones. I had the spicy pulled pork... Not sure who they are catering to by calling it spicy... It was not. Their 2 sauces are average at best. My side was the spinach mashed potatoes. I could be wrong, but judging by the taste and texture, they could have easily passed as high school cafeteria boxed potatoes. My husband had the Mac and cheese. He said it was pretty much just pasta smothered in cheese whiz. I had higher hopes for this place. It has potential. Might give it a second try and come back for dinner... Stay tuned!",

One point I'd also like to mention is that the staff doesn't wear hair nets. I normally wouldn't notice this until my husband pulled a 6-8 inch blondish hair from his mouth as he was eating his peach cobbler.   Neither one of us have blondish hair.   They resolved the matter quickly, refunding the price of the cobbler, and apologizing immediately so no concerns about customer service but yeah, that was kind of gross.

Most of the meats range in the $10-$13/lb range which is fair.  They have a lot of different combos for you to choose from as well.    In terms of the food, there were some ups and downs.  The smoked sausage was really good as were the jalepeno beans.  The brisket was overdone but still pretty tasty.  I look forward to trying it again when it's hopefully having a better day.  The spareribs were also overdone and not very good.  I liked the pulled pork though, it had a nice consistency and flavor to it.  Even with the meats that weren't great they were saved by some really good sauces.  Sauce should be used sparingly but the spicy variety was hard not to chug.  You could put that on a piece of cardboard and it'd be good.  Not the best BBQ but pretty decent.  I'll be back for a quick lunch from time to time.",

You want great BBQ go to Rudy's.  If you're looking for watered downed, perfume enhanced meat then this place is for you. (I should have known right off the bat that this place was horrible...there was no smoker to be found!)   Ordered half chicken, with garlic mashed and gravy, carrots, jalapeno biscuit and apple cobbler.  Chicken was horrible.  Tasted as if it was boiled and then thrown in a rotisserie and smoke flavoring sprayed on for that \"authentic\" BBQ taste.  Total Fail! Sides were definitely on par with a elementary school cafeteria.  The cobbler was a joke.  Doughy, weird non apple flavor.  The biscuit would be better served as a door stop.  Wife had pulled pork sliders and a side of green beans.  She enjoyed the sliders, although the pork was juicy it too had an off taste.  The green beans were horrible and mixed with tomatoes (we think) and remained uneaten.  Even the so called sauce was bad.  No spicy and watered down \"spicy\" sauce and super sweet \"classic\" were True disappointments.  Never in my life have I demanded a refund until today. Only got half back, better than nothing I guess.  Final sad piece is they were completely out of tea and the guy going around \"cleaning up\" picked up a few trays and completely ignored the water spilled near the entrance.  After making several attempts to have them clean up the water, someone finally showed up to do a quick mop up.  There's more water on the floor then before mopping.  The only good thing I can say about this place is that their pickles on the condiment bar are pretty tasty...good crunch.   Such a waste of time and money. Going next door to get some good eating and perhaps some tea.  Avoid this place at all costs!!! Epic and utter failure!!!",

Waited for 15 minutes. No one came to the front to greet me. I finally left. I'm glad to know they gave enough business that they don't need mine.",

I have lived all over and I'm telling you this is the best I had in Arizona! I tried the trendy place across the street and its cute but the FOOD at Can't Stop Smok'in is how its supposed to be for BBQ! The sweet and spicy sauces are both great but those RIBS are so good you dont need anyything on them! The Sausage is GREAT!  Get those Baked Beans! Peach and Blackberry COBBLER!  my mouth is watering thinking about it.  Order at the bar and carry it to your table like REAL BBQ! Call for carry-out and it's ready when you get there.",

The jalapeno biscuits smelled and tasted like old dryer lint, the sausage link tasted like a bland kosher hot dog (I actually threw half of it into the trash), the portions are tiny, the mac n cheese is completely tasteless. Velveeta would have been better than this mess. I mean no cheese whatsoever. I won't eat here again. Guess I've been spoiled by too many awesome BBQ spots like Yazoo in Denver, and places in the South, in Texas, and in Memphis too numerous to list.  The presentation and decor are great-- I'll give them that, but it's all form and no substance. Fancy digs aren't enough-- you have to serve good food as well. Don't waste your time and money at this place.",

Tried online and placed the order but there was no option to pay cash so, we went to the business at Chandler and 56th st to get the food where we were told they were out of chicken and brisket at the time.... What the *&^% are they doing? Why not tell me that when we were talking on the phone? Needless to say, we went elsewhere, Honey Bears. The Honey Bears food and sauce was amazing, as always. A little far but worth it. We'll just say NO to Can't stop smokin",

Admittedly Little Miss BBQ has ruined our life when it comes to eating any other BBQ food.  Nothing at all compares.  But since LMB is not open Sundays, Mondays or past 4pm, the search continues for an alternative.  This spot was okay.  Not amazing but not bad.  The location was very very clean and newer and the staff was very  friendly.  Its only took us about 10 minutes to order, pick up and leave.  The only thing we would not recommend again is the beef ribs.  They were very tough and thats something you expect to fall apart and just melt in your mouth.  Everything else would satisfy a healthy appetite.",

The guy that prepared my order seemed to believe that he was preparing a child's plate. I reminded him that I am an adult. He continued with the frugal portions. As stated, I've been here several times before and this was the smallest serving I have ever had!  My order was for takeout and when I got home I found that the guy put the bread in with the meat and it was a smushy mess!  I could not eat the bread as it was slimy and soaked in the juices from the meat. Never thought to ask him to separate the bread as in prior visits the bread was always wrapped separate from the rest of the meal.  I am very disappointed with the outcome of my visit. Had this been my first visit, this would have also been my last visit.  However, I know that this restaurant can do better so I will give them another chance. My rating is based on overall.  If it was based solely on tonight's visit, I would give only 1 star.",

A LOT of fat was on the meat.  I was charged by the pound, however I could only eat 1/2 the meat because the other 1/2 was fat.  2.) The cobbler was dry, very little fruit and way too much crust and sugar.  3.). The mashed potatoes had very little flavor and you could tell they were an instant mix.  4.) The staff was less than thrilled and seemed like you were bothering them as the served you through what I would call your basic chow hall line.  God forbid you would ask them a question that would require an answer that took more then two words.  I would have to say I have had better food at the hospital after having surgery.

(1st time there, was standing in the wrong area) finally, figured it out and tried to be really quick. between, all the constant sighing and loads of dropping of metal pans and utensils; i was a little uncomfortable. oh, and the annoyed blank faces... made me feel so welcome.   now,... the food was just kinda basic. i've had worst and i've definitely had better. brisket was kinda okay-ish; would order again if returned (somehow). now,... the cobbler dessert was pretty good (would return just for this). everything else was just kinda meh... no real distinct flavor profile and the same with the sauce just...MEH!   so in closing,... i would just say that, if i was a bbq place that was right next to a bbq place (another restaurant is across the street) with food that was meh (for the most part); i might have a bit better customer service (at all times), since people like me might just eat next door. customer service is so much more that meh food and sometimes even good food.",

    "text": "I hate to do this. What's worse, after this I have to write a similar review for Andrew's Barbeque, which I visited a few days prior. But really, the barbeque scene in Phoenix has improved over the years and places need to step up their game to succeed.  Most barbeque fans know that Rudy's opened in Chandeler near I-10. The week they opened we excitedly piled in the car and headed down to try it. I noticed this place then. It was about ready to open and I thought to myself, \"building a bbq place right next door to Rudy's is either the dumbest thing I have ever seen, or the most brilliant.' Think about it, if a place has good barbeque they could easily steal away some of Rudy's business. Rudy's is, after all, known for its extremely long lines and wait times.   The reality is Can't Stop Smokin's just does not taste very good. Bland. No flavor. Their sauces are not even that good. I did like the collard greens, but the rest was about what you would expect if you bought barbeque at a supermarket. I had Pete;s Pick, which includes pulled pork, beef brisket, hot links, and ribs, so I got to hit all of the main items. Maybe I just tried them at a bad time?  Service was decent. The place is clean and bright. Lines are not long usually, since everyone is next door at Rudy's. The only thing wrong is the food is not great. But in a restaurant, that is a pretty important factor.",

At Rudys the service is better and the food is seasoned great and has a good smoke flavor. At CSS the cafeteria style doesn't do it for me, I feel like I am 90 years old carrying a tray and looking at dried out meat that has been sitting out for hours. I got the brisket sandwich and it was terrible, it was SO dry. My husband makes amazing BBQ and we were actually amazed that a place could serve BBQ this terrible. I could barely choke it down.   The sides tasted like something my grandma would get at her retirement community, no flavor and completely bland.   The people behind the counter remind me of Jersey Shore idiots they can barely communicate what they are trying to tell you.    The worst part is EVERY great BBQ place must have good sweet tea. Rudys sweet tea is amazing - Cant Stop's sweet tea tastes like it had been sitting in its container for 3 weeks. It was the worst tea I have ever had. The only thing good there is the cobbler. At least someone making the desserts knows what they are doing. Lets just say I wish I would have kept my $30 and not wasted my time. At the end of our meal, I was still starving and angry that we threw 90 percent of our food in the trash can.  I made my husband walk over to Rudys - and get me a sweet tea and some prime rib to go. I felt like I should treat myself to some decent meat since I just wasted time and money on CSS. We will never be back and I will not recommend this place to anyone.",

I think two stars would lead people to believe there's something worth going here for. I've been to the one in Ruidoso and I remember it being a fair bit better. Nothing I've had here really has much flavor. If this is what these guys consider quality BBQ, they either don't have taste buds or have never had real BBQ.  The mac & cheese was horrendous. I'll normally put up with weak mac & cheese but this stuff makes Kraft seem gourmet and flavorful.   The corn is waterlogged and literally had no flavor.   You can get better sausage from the old lady giving out lunch samples at Sam's Club.  The tri-tip didn't have any flavor. I expected some kind of spice or beef flavor...or I don't know...maybe some smoke since they claim they can't stop smokin'. It just wasn't good.   Save your money and go somewhere else.",

The brisket only has flavor on one edge. They don't prep it so the flavor goes throughout the meat and it sits there precut so it can dry out while it's waiting on you to order it. That's a basic failure in serving this type of food. The sausage is store bought and sits around in a stack waiting for you to order it.   The sides are basic. Dried corn on the cob, macaroni and cheese with processed cheese (think Kraft with premade \"cheese\" in the box with an aftertaste) and the baked beans taste like canned beans with pepper added. The cornbread is God-awful. It's almost as dense as iron and has a really bad taste.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Even the Arizona Dickie's style BBQ joint is better than this. That, and there is a Ruby's literally just across the street. It's good, and head and shoulders better than this place that won't last long against its neighbor.",

    "text": "It's hard to review Can't Stop Smoking BBQ without referencing Rudy's BBQ right across the street.  I give Rudy's the edge on atmosphere, and the meats themselves were juicier and a little more flavorful... but EVERY other possible advantage goes to Can't Stop Smoking (CSS).  The sides, sauces, portions, value, variety, healthiness, accessibility, etc all favor CSS.  Upon entering, you grab an impressively heavy aluminum tray and go through a cafeteria line acquiring sliced meats.  I got a 2-meat combo, with a half-ear of corn, 2 sides, cornbread muffin, and a drink for $10.  (They also email coupons and have a stamp card.... which knocked the price down closer to $7.)  The turkey and brisket were both super lean, which I happen to like, even though that made them somewhat dry.  The turkey had a nice smokey flavor, but the dry rub on the brisket was uneven and overly salty/spicy in some bites.  No big deal because I enjoyed both the standard and spicy BBQ sauce options much better than the sauce at Rudy's.  The muffin and mac & cheese were both above average.  Amazingly, the corn wasn't totally overcooked like at most places, but I discovered that I hate mustard greens and had wasted one of my choices of sides.  Some of my friends ordered the ribs and said that was the best thing on the menu.  So where does that leave us?  Is it possible that I like the meat better at Rudy's and still like CSS better?  Yes, I think so.  I didn't have to wait in a huge line, struggle to find a table, or slice huge hunks of fat off my brisket.  (I also didn't feel gross when I left.)  I was able to order a combo, instead of \"decoding\" the menu to determine how much meat to order for my Wonderbread.  Can't Stop Smoking is a more commercial, more conventional experience than Rudy's, but I liked it.",

You go to the counter, point at what you want, and voila! In BBQ Heaven!  This isn't the BEST BBQ I have ever had. But for the money you would be hard pressed to find a better value. I didn't try any of the sandwiches, IMO if you're going to a BBQ place for a sandwich you're wasting your time. I tried the brisket, carnitas, baked beans, mac and cheese, corn bread, corn, and iced tea. All that for $10.  Brisket was good, would have preferred a little more moist, but that's a personal preference. Carnitas were perfect. Beans and the Jalapeno Cornbread, and corn were great. Mac was lacking a little in the flavor department.   I'll definitely be back again, especially since I've only had a small portion of what the menu has to offer.",

First, why open a restaurant with a competing vision and style? Rudy's and Can't Stop Smoking both do the bbq niche with a cafeteria style service, which I am not a big fan of.  The staff was o.k. but when I said something about bbq places in phoenix she said some retort about only one or two \"real\" bbq joints in town..Seriously I'm not a foodie just hungry and want to eat.  The staff behind the counter were incredibly helpful when it came to meal choices and they were friendlier than the waitstaff.  I ordered the 1/2 chicken combo.  The chicken was well cooked and tasty, liked that there was no sauce so I could put as much or not as I wanted later. The jalapeno cornbread muffin was stale and bland.  I had the mac n cheese and garlic potatoes for sides..Not very tasteful and not warm enough! I could have made better macaroni and cheese at home, seriously.  I probably wouldn't set foot in this establishment again until the food gets hot and service gets better.  I should have listened to my instincts and gone to Famous Daves instead, hell Boston market would have been a better choice..",

They have a large menu, so there is something for everyone on it.  Home run for me was on the way out of the restaurant...they have a small table setup with wooden tokens.  You take one token and put it into one of three bowls.  Each bowl represents a different charity.  They take a percentage from the meal that you just bought and donate it to the charity.

I've had their feasts (a tremendous value), I've had different meals, and I've been there 15 - 20 times - NEVER had a bad experience.   I see some of the other lower rated reviews and I have to wonder... There's a Rudy's literally right next door... and they are absolutely disgusting. I went there twice and you'll never find me there again. So I have to wonder if these people with the lower scores actually know where they ate. Everyone's entitled to their opinion but I'd hate to see Can't Stop Smokin' get punished for Rudy's terrible food.",

They wrapped everything well and the food was still hot after a 20 minute commute home. The brisket was cooked excellently with a good smoke flavor, and the carnitas very very tasty.

I ordered the #2 combo that included a meat choice, 2 sides, a bread (jalapeno cornbread for me) and a drink for $8.99. Now that's a deal! The sliced brisket was moist and lean and had a nice smoke ring. Mustard greens and new potatoes needed a little salt, but that's a taste preference. This is cafeteria style service which is quick. I can't get over the wide selection of meats and sides compared to the place right across the street. In fact, this may be my go-to bbq place when I'm in the area.",

For what I got in food, (reg $50+ for $20 with Groupon) we could have got SO MUCH MORE at Rudy's. The beans don't hold a candle to Rudy's and they don't give you any bread!  They are super picky about not giving you any amount over the 2 lbs of meat since the guy took the meat and trimmed off a piece the size of about 4 postage stamps. Rudy's would have not done that!  The meat was good, but not near as good as Rudy's. The mashed potatoes and gravy have a flavor that don't even go with the BBQ. I would encourage them to drop prices, include bread and improve the food of they truly want to compete.",

We had brisket and pulled pork. The warm sauces were delicious. The sides were above average (ok, the beans could be spicier, but the garlic mashed potatoes and green beans were superb). Blackberry cobbler was rich and tasty. All of the portions were large, no skimping here! Lastly, the customer service was fantastic. The two young people working that day, Robin and Dustin were very polite, engaged and enthusiastic about their jobs and assisting their customers.

Places get mucho points for delivery and it's near impossible to go it to eat with 3 kids who are 3yrs as under. So we called and they informed they were not delivering that night...so we didn't order at that time...The hostess on the phone was not very apologetic and kinda rude. We tried again after purchasing a Groupon. Once again they were not delivering. The hostess said they were too busy to deliver to us. We ordered take it and had my husband go pick it up. The food is quite good...The pulled pork is my fave as well as the sausage. Haven't found a side that I really like yet. When my husband picked up the food they would only honor half of or Groupon. They said Groupon had made a mistake and they wouldn't honor the full price only hall and to save the other half for a second purchase. So we did and had to order again that next month before the Groupon expired. We called again to check if they were delivering. They were not...The hostess said o well we are under staffed right now so we are not delivering... A few days later I tried again. This time they were delivering and we used the remaining Groupon. Most likely won't be going back or ordering again. The stars come from food and flavor, but free rude staff and exuses about delivering were quite agitating. It's sad coz they really have potential. Better than the place next door (right next door is Rudys) their loss though they could have had some regular customers.",

It just gets worse every week.  I would like to WARN people that they go there at their own risk!",

For my sides I got the bbq beans and the potato wedges with gravy. The meats bothhad good flavor but the brisket was definitely on the dry side. It was it was the last piece in the container could be why. The Carnitas were really really good super tender and flavorful.  My boyfriend also got the brisket and he had the same opinion for his second option he went with the sausage that was really tasty.     The barbecue baked beans absolutely delicious. They had a nice Smoky flavor with a slight kick definitely one of the better baked beans that I've had at a barbecue place. The potato wedges were just as equally good. They soak them in a garlic butter sauce and to top it off with the gravy was just perfection. Wasn't too impressed with the jalapeno cornbread I was expecting little bit more spicy flavors but still was not bad definitely will try the dinner roll next time.  I like the fact that your foods ready immediately no 45+min wait and the food to price ratio is better than their competitors. The staff was super friendly and gave good opinions on what to try.",

The original price is around $40 or $45. The amount of meat is definitely worth the money if you're feeding a family of four.  We ordered BBQ chicken and Pulled pork.  The meat given was enough to put on four sandwiches.  And there were quite a bit of leftovers for us. We're a family of 2, so my husband was able to eat at least two more meals out if he leftovers.    The food is all very good, my only complaint is that I kept burping up the BBQ flavor.  Haha. (Gross? I'm sorry)  I don't know if I would purchase the picnic deal without a Groupon/coupon.  For 40 something that just seems like A LOT, even for the amount of sides included. (Or maybe I'm cheap. Haha)  My husband definitely likes the food here so we'll be back.  I'm sure they have smaller portions too, where you won't have to buy so much food.

Sides were also impressive. I'm in love with their mashed potatoes. Mac salad is also very tasty. Smooth and creamy - not too sweet or heavy.   OMG - eating here is an absolute MUST! I know I'll be hitting them up again very soon. Love you, Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ. XOXO",

But the meats and sides were on point! Very juicy and tender. Meat server suggested the carnitas over the ribs for our  1/2# meat option, and they were great. Brisket and pulled pork also really flavourful and tender, even the beef tritip was tender. Baked beans were good, not great, everyone loved the Mac and cheese, and the mashed potatoes and gravy we're also good. Nice beer selection as well.",

We arrived to a fairly empty restaurant on a midday Saturday, with two great desires - my salivating over getting good down home BBQ, and finding another location in the area I can come back to regularly.  But we were not impressed, it does not seem like I will return considering so many BBQ joints in the area to try.  We lunched there in a typical BBQ-style ambience... very plain, simple and non-descript decor.  Our meal consisted of Pete's Pick of baby back ribs (with little meat and on the dry side) with mashed taters & green beans.  Also had their Make it a Meal of spare ribs, pulled pork, sausage & brisket with corn on the cobb, collards (pretty good) & biscuit (dry), giving us a try of their overall menu selection.  It's totally unpretentious vibe and atmosphere, with no fantastic service or attention, it's a counter-service style, and last, but not least, a limited selection of BBQ dishes dismayed my desire to return. So much on the menu appeared mouthwatering, yet short on taste and/or legitimacy!  Being a Brisket lover, I was thoroughly disappointed with their offering!  Now don't get me wrong, it was a decent lunch, but nothing to write home about!  With so many other BBQ joints in the Valley, many others are better.",

The carrots were sweet and a nice addition to the meal.  My mother got the smoked turkey with green beans and spinach mashed potatoes.  The turkey was so tasty and you could really taste the smoked flavor.  She loved the seasonings on the green beans and the mashed potatoes were unique and very yummy.  We both loved the jalepeno corn bread muffins which were sweet but had a nice spicy kick as well.  We tried all of the sauces and the \"new\" and \"original\" were our 2 favorites.

From the second you step out of your car you can literally smell the sweet smokiness of the meat being cooked. The atmosphere inside is really nice as well- Very clean establishment.  The best part is the ordering system: You step up to the line and order what looks good- You are able to visually pick out what you want which is awesome. And if you're really indecisive (like me) the staff is super friendly and can even make suggestions. (They'll also give you samples, you just gotta ask.)  I ended up having a Combo #4 which is St. Louis style ribs, a side of potatoes, chicken salad and a piece of the everything pie. I can honestly say there isn't anything there I didn't like.. Even their sweetened iced tea (which is just lightly sweetened and doesn't taste like corn syrup in a cup) was delicious!  The food itself was a hit but I think the most impressive thing about this place was the staff and their exceptional customer service. Nowadays it's rare to see people that are so helpful and",

When I got there, there was hardly anyone in the building on a Friday night. Except for one employee, no one smiled or seemed to care that I was there. I saw the beef ribs and noticed they were wrapped in plastic, but I said, I will try them anyway. There were three ribs that were priced per half pound and came out to 27.00 Dollars. It was high, but I had a hankering for this type of rib, so I went for it.  Well, I should have known better. They were tough and fatty and all though they had some dark char they had no flavor at all, and quite frankly were disgusting. They simply tasted like left over ribs from days ago. Perhaps that's why they were wrapped in cellophane wrap. I should have returned them, but did not want to bother. I just threw them out and left. Even the potatoes I got were greasy and tasteless. Like earlier mentioned no one seemed to care and it certainly showed. Even the brisket through the glass looked left over and dry. For a Saturday night to have hardly anyone there, should tell you something. I went next door to Rudy's and could not even get in there were so many people in line. I should have taken the reviews more seriously. Never again.",

    "text": "I'm stuck between 2 and 3 stars...2 1/2 stars if I could. We decided to give Can't Stop Smokin a try since I had a gift certificate from work.  The atmosphere is actually really comfortable and nicely decorated to go with their BBQ theme. It's sort of cafeteria style; grab a metal tray, place your order and they'll bring it to you at the end of the line where you pay, and seat yourself.  We both ordered the #3 combos which comes with two meats, corn on the cob, two sides, dinner rolls and a drink. It's a lot of food! We could have easily shared one plate. I got the pulled pork, and the sausage. He got the brisket and sausage. For our sides we both had the baked beans and the garlic buttered potatoes. I read in other reviews the mashed are box potatoes, so I knew I wouldn't be getting any of that, I can't stand box mashed potatoes with their grainy off texture. Also...when we were looking at the sides they were offering, we saw a hair in their mashed potatoes. Yikes...  Service here was really friendly. Everyone seemed helpful and happy to be there.  The food was...okay. The sausage was moist and had some flavor, as was the pulled pork and brisket. Their BBQ Sauce I'm not a fan of. I didn't like the spicy one at all it just tasted weird, and the regular one had too much vinegar in it which gives it an almost alcohol taste. The baked beans were eh...not great but ok, just like their other dishes. The garlic potatoes I'm pretty sure are frozen and reheated. They don't taste fresh at all. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to them to get any flavor. The corn on the cob piece was pretty good. Juicy and they add butter to it. Also their dinner rolls are really good, they're basic but they were fresh, and soft so I really liked them. For dessert we shared the apple cobbler since other Yelpers seemed to enjoy it and it was tasty. We both agreed the best tasting things on our plates were the rolls and apple cobbler.  Overall this place is decent enough, but it's overpriced compared to the quality you get. Those sides truly are poor quality, I don't think anything is made fresh, or if it is, they freeze it and reheat which downgrades the food because nothing reheated will ever taste fresh. Like I said, we only came here because we had a $10 off coupon. We're HUGE fans of Rudy's, who is literally right next door, it's a regular place for us so I think we'll stick with them instead but I'm glad we gave this place a try. If you haven't tried Rudy's you should; good prices, flavorful food, excellent BBQ sauce, and much better quality.",

I was greeted upon entering and given a tutorial of all they had to offer. I had purchased the Picnic Meal with 2lbs of meat, 2 large sides, a medium cobbler, cornbread, & an entire bottle of BBQ sauce!! Claimed to be a meal for 4, but fed 5 with a little left over. The meats were cooked well and focused on natural flavors. I can't really compare it with Rudy's across the street because they use a lot of seasonings to alter their meats. I won't lie and claim it to be the best, but we had absolutely no complaints and shall definitely be coming back!",

    "text": "The girls and I decided to stop by and give this BBQ a try. We walked in and looked at the food, and I turned to them and said, \"I think we should turn around, walk out, and go to another restaurant.\" Being the nice, thoughtful women they are, they decided that we should at least give Can't Stop Smokin' one try. So, we did.   I want my lunch hour, money, and palate back, please.  1. The turkey was very dry, and there was no flavor of smoke or of the dry rub. Nor was there any hint of a smoke ring. It shattered when touched with a fork. When I smelled it, it smelled like a combination of the hot, cheap plastic wrap it had been wrapped in combined with some sort of slightly off pork product.  1a. The turkey was STICKY when chewed. It stuck to my teeth, then turned into some sort of gummy paste with a grainy texture. I ate less than a third of my portion before throwing my hands up in defeat. And it was a struggle to get that far; my friends kept laughing at my facial expressions while I  was trying to choke it down.  2. Instant potatoes. Instant. Really? Boil up some suckers and take a masher to them, people! And the gravy from a packet wasn't that great either. Salty, salty, salty. I can feel my cells shriveling up as I type.  3. The sweet tea tasted like the container had not been properly cleaned or sanitized. A slightly musty, moldy taste lingered.   4. The hostess was EATING at the entrance and ignoring customers. We did not receive a greeting or farewell.  5. The layout is somewhat awkward, but had the food been good, I would have navigated a complex maze.   5. No condiments on the tables...until we left, and the hostess brought them out...and hour after the restaurant opened.  6. The checkout attendee was not quite on the ball, causing some confusion with our payment; we requested that two meals be paid for together, and they were rung up as just one meal, causing the her to chase us down for the remainder of the bill.  Were there any positives?  1. The lemons for the tea were huge, juicy and fresh.  2. The barbecue sauces tasted no worse than any generic one out of a bottle...but no better, either.  3. The green beans were edible.  4. I have a doggy bag full of food for my pup that the humans couldn't manage to choke down.  How would I sum up my experience? I'll let my friend's statement do that for me:  Her: I have barbecue sauce on my finger.  Me: Lick it off.  Her: I don't want to put that stuff back in my mouth, once was bad enough.",

    "text": "Ordered some take out tonight and couldn't have been more pleased. The past few visits to FD left a lot to be desired so decided to change it up and check out \"Can't Stop Smokin BBQ\" First, walking in the door you are exposed to a tremendously pleasant aroma of BBQ & meat. Moving onto the deli counter to place my order I was greeted by a gentleman who couldn't have been friendlier. One thing that stood out for me was that he wrapped the to go containers nicely in plastic wrap.  I have never had my take out wrapped like that. It was a nice touch that more restaurants should take note of. I ordered the combo #4 - sandwich and chose the brisket for the meat with Elsie's Garlic Potatoes and Smokin Joe's Baked Beans for my sides.  Wife had combo #6 - 4 pork ribs; she opted for the baby back style (spare rib is the other option). She went with the mac & cheese and spinach mashed potatoes for her sides. As I mentioned in my intro our past couple of visits to FD were very disappointing. This was the complete opposite. The meat was tender, moist, not fatty and very flavorful.  Both the baked beans and the mac & cheese had great flavor - really nice smoky flavor to the beans. Both the garlic potatoes and spinach mashed potatoes were a little bland. That is the only slight criticism of the meal. I will give Can't Stop Smokin another visit but will probably skip the potatoes as a side. I'll try something else or get a double of the beans.",

Time to stop and grab some lunch. Everyone is hungry and little bit on the irritated side. We stop into Can't Stop Smoking BBQ, yes it's a real place in Chandler AZ. As soon as we open the door this lady was there greet us. Instantly, she knows my little boy is not on the happy side. She grabs him small plate of Mac n cheese. Man, his face lit up in happiness. This made me and the wife smile not because of a free item but going above and beyond. Her kindness continued as she rang us up. Just the happiest personality you can think of.   She continued to share this attitude with everyone including her employees. People were saying to their family how nice and happy she was. As we left, I had to return the appreciation. As I waited for her to finish her conversation with a customer I told her \"You have made this visit very special and you kind attitude has made our day better\". She was greatly appreciated.   Time to finish the shopping. The attitude passed on to us and we shared it with many other doing small gracious things making everyone smile.",

Once I sat down, I couldn't help but notice the black light fixtures and some inflatable black football helmets hanging from the ceiling were covered in dust, which was very off putting. Dining table was sticky. Otherwise, the massive timber infrastructure and tables were pretty cool.  I got the pulled (mushed) pork and brisket, both tasted smoky and weren't too bad for the price paid. Mac and cheese was baked macaroni with a stadium nacho cheese sauce. The red potatoes with herbs were very good. Please clean this place up! Seeing the dirty dining room made me wonder what the kitchen looked like.",

That was fine as we were found to see a movie at 9:15p so we were going to be gone well before that.  The gentleman on staff that evening was very pushy in reminding us when they closed coming to our table multiple times to remind us they were closing before 8:30p.  I understand they want to get home on Sunday evening but pushing customers out the door will not get you to repeat customers.  I live out of town, but the two people with me are not so they most like will not be back. The food was ok. Food alone, I can't say I would come back.",

The staff seems to be very irritated, if you are not sure what to order their response is very rude making you feel uncomfortable and rushed. I ordered the number 3 comb which consist of two meats and two sides. My choices were spareribs sausage link Season potatoes macaroni and cheese Choice of bread was a jalapeno muffin.  I went with those choices because the greens looked old and soggy everything seem like it was set out all day. I'm going to end this. I have to go to the restroom this food is not settling with my stomach. Sorry eat at your own risk. Some guy in the back keeps sneezing without covering his mouth today gross!",

    "text": "I definitely should have read the reviews before I went here, especially the unrecommended reviews because they are on target with my experience here. The good, the brisket was very tender, the portion size was fine and the macaroni salad was very good. The bad, although the brisket was tender it was flavorless except for a slight plastic wrap flavor. It was such an odd, offputting flavor that no matter how hard I tried I couldn't eat more than a few bites. I added some sauce, I believe it was called Original Sauce and once again there was very little flavor, very bland. The mashed potatoes were okay, I think the addition of the gravy and knowing I wasnt going to eat for several hours encouraged me to suck it up and eat them. I may have expected too much from the simple dinner roll, it was ehhhh. Adding butter didn't even make me want to eat it.  I feel like I cheated on my favorite BBQ restaurant and got what I deserved.",

The sides looked aged and tasted bland. The cashier instead of trying to work with us on our misunderstanding of the groupon just had an I don't care attitude.

Together we ordered the sausage, brisket, tri-tip, ribs, pulled pork, garlic potatoes and green beans.  Breaking it down:  The tri-tip had no smoke flavor.  It was a nice cut of meat and tasted like a nice cut of meat.  But no seasoning or smoke flavor evident.  Dipping in their \"original\" sauce added some flavor.  I also tried their \"spicy\" sauce which, frankly, wasn't that spicy and had a flavor I didn't really care for.  They were honest that they don't make the sausage.  I can respect that.  The sausage itself was good.  Not as good as Rudy's, but good.  The brisket was arguably the best item we had.  Moist, tender, and had some evidence of smokiness to it.  Again, dip in the original sauce and it was actually pretty good.  The spareribs were nice.  Decent smoky flavor.  I ate mine without sauce and they were pretty good.  The pulled pork was OK.  I think it had more smoke flavor than our last visit (where I commented that there wasn't any).  But both my wife and I noted that there was something different about it.  Not really sure what.  Was it really smoke?  Not sure, but I'll give the benefit of the doubt here.  The green beans were average.  Overcooked severely, and I happen to like my green beans a little overcooked.  But this was probably too much.  The potatoes were ok but not much garlic flavor.  We got a sample of their baked beans, but after tasting them opted not to make them one of our sides.  Van Camp's with a pinch of seasoning.  Compare and contrast to Joe's Real BBQ with their beans...it's not even close.  And Rudy's has their green chile stew that is really good.  The sides here are very uninspired and uninspiring.  The folks behind the counter weren't really enthusiastic this time, but they were friendly and patient, and answered questions without making us feel like we were keeping them from something.  No complaints there.  One annoyance was when I asked the cashier about upgrading the beverage in the combo.  Normally it's a fountain drink, but I didn't want a fountain drink.  If figured if they charge me the difference I can get something better.  They didn't say I couldn't, so I thought it was cool.  We got a different beverage and.ended up paying full price for it (which I didn't realize until I had the printed receipt).  That's kinda not cool.  Overall I really can't give them any more stars this time than last time.  It's still \"I've experienced better\".  It's not bad, but I think they miss on too many flavor points to get excited about this place.  There are several others out there that do a better job in the flavor department.  Which is too bad.  As near as I can tell this is the only location, so it's a local shop not a franchise (like Dave's BBQ or Rudy's BBQ are franchises...they have several locations including in other states).  I like finding single-location places because the quality is usually better, in my opinion.  But I just can't recommend this one.",

There were 2 bbq sauces available and given to you in little plastic cups.  One sweet and one hot which was not really spicy hot.  13 sides were offered, I had mustard greens, which I thought were wonderful and corn on the cob, sweet and of course over cooked, but good tasting.  The bread came with 2 choices, a dinner roll (soft, nice tasting, we liked it a lot, and a jalapeno corn bread muffin (not spicy, somewhat heavy and dry, I would avoid it).  Their cobbler desert came in peach, apple and berry.  We had the peach cobbler which was excellent. I heard their cookies were quite good.  Definitely a meal worth 4 stars.",

I choose the brisket and the chicken along with some mash potatoes and mac and cheese. I was a bit confused when I saw the metal trays as I knew this was a lunch style cafeteria, but when I saw the plates I felt better lol I thought for a second I was eating off the metal trays ... Anyhow honest review... Brisket was okay it def had the smoke taste and flavor but it was on the dry side, and for me I loveeee the fats on the brisket and I was very happy they put at least a piece on there for variety butttttttt.... My piece with the fat was very weird tasting full of char and almost gamey like so I'm not sure what exactly happened? The chicken was very tender but it was definitely bland and thank goodness for their house  bbq sauce that made the dish a tad bit better. My mac and cheese was wonderful and standard, but the mash potatoes left a weird taste in my mouth! For some reason the texture was very very creamy it's hard to describe almost like it wasn't mash potatoes and the flavor was just overpowered with pepper. Overall I like the concept I would probably go back to try the pulled pork instead and some other meats, but this just my honest review... Maybe it'll be better next time?",

I tried the pulled pork and ribs. The pork was okay but the ribs were tough and no better than what I could have made at home, a big disappoint. No sure if I would give another shot or just go to Dickies.",

    "text": "YOU HAVE TO BUY A SOFT DRINK TO GET A WATER CUP LARGER THAN 6 OUNCES!!!!!!  We've been customers since they opened.  The BBQ has been hit and miss at times, but is generally OK.  We nearly always get \"take out,\" but for some reason during our most recent visit we decided to eat in.  I don't drink alcohol and have never enjoyed soda pop with BBQ, so I asked for water just like I always have.  Imagine my shock when the cashier handed me a 6 ounce cup for my water!  I complained, and the cashier gave me a second 6 ounce cup.  I was not pleased.  OK, then I got it.  Peter wants to force me to pay for a soft drink so I could get a decent size cup for my water.  And it doesn't matter how much you am spending on your meal..... if you insist on water you get a 6 ounce water cup or pay the added charge for soda pop.    We hadn't paid yet, so I announced we were leaving.  At that point a long-time staff member gave me a 12 ounce cup at no charge, saying she did not want to lose my business.  I still had to refill it two or three times during the course of the meal, but it was much better than the 6 ounce cup.  She also said I would have to talk with Peter about this policy.  Just to be clear, your attempt to nickle and dime me over something like a water cup just about tears it with me.    So Peter, you better listen up pardner.... if you want to run a fast food type of joint, then your water cup policy is fine with me.  I just won't do business with you.  But If you want to operate a BBQ restaurant your water cup policy needs to CHANGE BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS IF YOU WANT TO KEEP MY BUSINESS.",

    "text": "If this place invented the pulled pork parfait....they should be given an award! This place is also kind of cafeteria style. Grab a tray and step up to the meat counter. There are plenty of meat-tastic items to choose from. I sampled the brisket after a pal ordered it and loved it.  Obviously I ordered the parfait. Two types of beans to choose from. I went with the more country style, not the jalapeno ones, but only bc I'm more of a country beans type of gal. Next up, potato layer...3 types of potatoes to choose from! Red potato wedges, garlic mashed and some froofy spinach mashed potato. I went with the classic red wedge. The others looked great I just wanted the potato as a whole piece instead of mashed. Finally, this masterpiece is topped with pulled pork. Mmmmm! I sauced this guy at the table myself. I love both of their sauce options, one spicy, one a tad more sweet and classic.   Great happy hour bottled beer special til 6, I think! Great apple and cherry pie. Peach cobbler....yum!  I will definitely be back! I have the other half of my groupon to use!",

When this place opened, I was very impressed, thought it could be better than Rudy's (across the street). Well, after a bit of time, we went back. Mistake. The guy helped my family, then when I said I thought  the Market price on brisket was a bit high and Rudy's was lower, he said \"'yea, it is,\" walked off and ignored me - jerk. My son got the ribs and thought they were too spicy. His taste, not theirs. My wife brought them up and the guy actually started to argue with her. A-hole. Since when does an employee decide what a customer's tastes are., He reluctantly said \"well, we can't take them back\". I was going to return the chicken breast, but decided I didn't want to deal with their attitudes again. The breast, by the way was the driest chicken I've ever had. I couldn't drink enough tea to wash is down. The pie? Bland and salty. Beans - vomit.  Now I know why Rudy's had a line out the door and you could hear crickets in this place. We only came over because Rudy's had the line - next time its worth the wait.  Here's some friendly advice for you yahoos at CSSBBQ - if you are going to build a smoked BBQ restaurant next to an incredibly popular, great tasting place. Try a little harder and be a bit more accommodating to the few customers you have. Oh, and have a good product.  They may not come back - I know I will never set foot in this joke of a BBQ place again. Give it up.",

When you walk in to the very empty restaurant, you notice there is no smell of smoked meats, which is odd if they are selling smoked meats. The food is served cafeteria style. We tried the sausage, which tasted like store bought sausage. It was not at all special. We also tried the carnitas which lacked flavor, brisket which was soaking in a water solution, ribs which were average, Mac and cheese which wasted like gummy noodles, baked beans that were likely from a can, and corn bread that was rubbery and so bad it got spit in the trash. The BBQ sauce had an ok flavor, but it was very thin. The rub on the brisket was a sugary rub, which was about the only flavor I noticed besides a liquid smoke flavor. If you're looking for a great BBQ spot, head towards Can't Stop Smokin, then turn into the parking lot across the street and go into Rudy's and order any of the meats and the green chile stew.",

    "text": "Ok, decided to try this place, after already checking out Rudy's (across the street).  Step 1. Went in the front door, NOBODY there to greet you.  We waited a few more mins. Then just walked in.  We asked the \"kids\" in front the the cafeteria style food.  Do we seat ourselves?  (&**#*&$*&*@&) he mumbled.  Didn't quite, understand what he said.  So we, grabbed the menus and started asking questions, Cuz nobody, told us \"anything\" about how to order,etc.... anywho.... we order the #3.  Now, you can add either a baby back or spare rib for a buck more, which we did.  The meal comes with either lemonade or ice tea.  NOTE:  we had to ASK for the baked beans, for our meal.  They didn't have them out to see.  Instead, the had these \"HUGE\" trays of HUGE potatoes (Think a russet potato, cut into 4's) wayyyy too much. And it DIDN'T make me think,,,, ahhhhh I'm here for some BBQ.  I passed on the Mountain Man, potatoes, and asked, Hey, do you have baked beans??? He said, oh yeah,  and scooped me out some.  We get out dranks, and head to the table..... WTF!!! ALL the FOOD is \" C O L D \"!!!! not luke warm.... Fricking \" C O L D \" we nibble and then I tell the \"Mgr\"  our food is cold.  The Couple in front of us, said Their food was cold too! So, they go about explaining, they didn't know the warmer was off, etc  They took our food, and said they would get us more, and it would be hot.  They turned their warmers back on.  OK,,,,,, 2nd Round.  I got the Fricking Dam Mountain Man Potatoes.  NOT what i had on my plate the first time..  Plus.... we couldn't figure out what was so dam Hot..... They pile on \"PEPPER\" on these potatoes.  I LOVE hot, but it was alittle too much for me.. The food was STILL \"warm-cool\" . Neither of us, wanted to eat it.  They did offer to refund our purchase.  Which I took. They did ask me how the food was.  I didn't want to tell them it was, awful. But, the manager insisted.  So, I told her, It wasn't good.  I took my refund.  I think it could be a Good place. Its new, and they have some kinks to work out. Here's my suggestions, for whats its worth:  1. Have someone at the front to greet the guest. Especially 1st timers. 2. Put the \"Bar B Q\" fixings to the front.  Not them dam Over-sized Pepper Tatters!  Yuk 3. The Chicken Breast was SO dang dry. Probably, better to shread them 4. The Ribs.... I didn't even eat mine. So, I cant give an opinion on it.  But, It didn't look appetizing either. 5. Make sure the Food is \"HOT\"  Will I go again..... Probably Not.  Will I reccomend?....Probably  Not.  As a matter of fact. 2 guys were on their way in, and asked how the food was.  I had to answer, honestly.   Mmmmm,  Ech,  Think they went across the street. Cuz, they went in, got the menu and left.  btw: Rudy's, is \"slightly\" better.  At least the food was hot.  I'm NOT a Rudy's fan either, but Id probably go back there",

The layout and line management are clumsy.  The staff is poorly managed - it felt like watching a ladybugs soccer match (everyone runs toward the ball with nobody sticking to their stations).  And there is no reason I should have to carry a menu through a cafeteria style restaurant, where I am also carrying a bulky food tray (with 2 hands).  Just look at your neighbor - put the menu on the menuboard! Sauce tasted off-the-shelf, but was still better than its neighbor's, Rudys. 3-stars are for potential.  The meat is decent.  Work out the kinks on the staff, side dishes and desserts, then do a few more tenant improvements to the menuboard and line management (see Rudy's drink tubs and cold side dish cooler), get some good beer, scrap the heavy cookie sheets used as food trays... and maybe this place can out-last Rudy's.",

If this place were as good at having poor reviews hidden away as that over-hyped, over-priced, under-smoked waste of money Rudy's is, it might appear more as Rudy's equal, and to be clear, that's less of an indictment of Can't Stop Smokin's basic mediocrity and more of an indictment of Rudy's flavorless excuse for Texas barbecue and tasteless approach to review sites.  I tried the pork spare ribs, Tri-tip, and sausage  ere at Can't Stop Smokin and none of them were anything to write home about or tell friends \"hey, ya gotta try this!\".  They were just...OK.  At least they had some smoke in them, and they weren't just seasoned with 18 lbs of black pepper, which is more than can be said for anything on the menu across the street.  Same thing goes for the sides;  they're just OK.  The mac & cheese was pretty good, but the corn on the cob was mushy, the potatoes were bland,  and the butter they serve is simply butter flavored spread.    The Sauce:  Not bad.  On the sweet/bland side, but not bad.  The place was clean, the staff was helpful and nice, and the linemen carefully trimmed the excess fat from the tri-tip before serving it, but between these two joints at this intersection, I've had it up to here with \"barbecue\" of questionable provenance that comes out of bins wrapped in saran-wrap before it's cut and served.     Phoenix:  Where's the GREAT barbecue?  The real kind that comes out of a real smoker right before it's served?   Is there any in this town?  This intersection here in Chandler sure doesn't have it, and neither do any of the handful of other places I've been here.",

    "text": "Still in search of a BBQ place that blows my mind.  In the central coast, they invented the stuff, so a good tri-tip is always on the brain so i decided to stop by (even thought there was another bbq place ironically parked next door). Well, this place was decent and I would go to again. A few of the foods were bland but decent portion sizes for not much coin. What i did enjoy is how everyone, from the front counter to the line cook to the cashier to everyone was absolutely friendly and helpful. Made some of their own choice recommendations. I enjoyed it. Upon leaving, the guy even stopped me to ask me how it was - I let him know what i thought. I think he's book his trip to Santa Maria/San Luis Obispo.",

I don't mind serve yourself cafeteria style, but we had to lug these huge metal pans along with the menu through the line. Not an easy task. I asked for the brisket  sandwich and the line server asked if I like sauce. I said sure...so he loaded me up with the stuff already swimming in sauce. First big mistake. My sides were coleslaw and mac and cheese (both very bland and not worth more than one taste) My husband looked at the stuff on my tray and went with the tri-tip (no sauce) and beans and garlic potatoes. He was able to eat his sandwich and potatoes at least. I took one bite of the brisket and nearly gagged from the amount of vinegar in the sauce. And the meat had been in the tray so long, it was hard to tell if it really was meat. UGH.  No second chances, sorry. Just too much not to like.",

    "text": "(Will probably be a five star when I can get a cold beer to enjoy with my BBQ)  First tried their smoked beef jerky at a charity golf tournament before they opened and it was delicious. The interior is beautifully done and a tribute the the owner of this franchise who also builds custom log homes. They are serious about smoked meats as you might derive from the name and it doesn't disappoint. All the meats I have tried (jerky, brisket, tri-tip, baby back ribs & sausage) are smoked perfectly and really did not require any sauce to enhance the flavor. If you prefer sauce on your meats they have you covered as well. Both the regular and the southwest style are very good. I haven't tried to many of the sides yet, but the jalapeno beans and coleslaw were both pretty good. I really love the enthusiasm and knowledge of the GM and the staff. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and the history of the restaurant. It has a small family owned feel to the business that I hope they are able to keep as they expand the concept outside of New Mexico and Arizona. Definitely a home run for me and I will make it a regular in the rotation.",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket, it was moist and fall apart tender with great flavor and the bbq sauce was hot and spicy. The greens were surprisingly good, lots of flavor, the mac n cheese was on par with other mac n cheese ive had at bbq places, tasty but nothing special. The red potatoes were fine, they had seasoning on them but were just kind of plain to me, and the cornbread had a good texture and taste but as my personal preference I dont enjoy cornbread with corn kernels in it. The chicken had really good flavor, but as white meat does..it got dry during cooking. We dipped it in that bbq sauce and were happy. We Also got tye peach cobbler but none of us really liked it. There was more plain hard dough chunks than anything else, definitely not enough peach or spice. 4 stars might seem pretty generous when I only truly enjoyed maybe half the items, but those items were awesome! Totally worth a try to sample and see what you like based on your taste, as for me I'll be back for the brisket and greens!",

The brisket was very good and I really liked the classic BBQ sauce.  Macaroni salad and pie were also good.  One thing I look forward to at BBQ places is a good sweet tea; however, both times I was disappointed in the tea, tasted terrible like it was tainted, so bad that I couldn't even drink it and poured it out. Not sure if It's their cleaning process or if it's non-filtered water but it was foul both time and a year apart. Tried the unsweetened tea and it was also weird.  I had not come back in so long because of the disappointment in be tea, I was in the area though and remembered that he food was good so figured I would give it another chance. Don't think I will be returning again the tea being bad again. I think they have better food than their competitor Rudy's next door, but Rudy's knows how to do the tea right.",

    "text": "Wanted to try a new BBQ place with a friend and we agreed to Can't Stop Smokin' BBQ! We consider ourselves connoisseurs when it comes to food and drink. On first impressions when pulling into our parking space outside of the building I noticed that there wasn't too many cars in the parking lot. When we walked into the building we saw a pie case that was large enough for about twenty plus pies but only had two, scattered out. Wasn't there for the pie, just the BBQ. There was no employees to greet you or to tell you what to do. Again, our first time. We saw some painted feet so we followed those to the counter. Man behind the counter said nothing to us for about two minutes until we approached the counter where all the meats and sides were being held. A couple people behind us showed up and were raving about the place and so on. I'm guessing they enjoy the McRib at McDonald's cause the BBQ sucked. I ordered two pounds of brisket, garlic potatoes and Mac n cheese. First off, the meats were precut, sitting in there juices and looked very dry. I commented that to my friend, we almost left before ordering but I insisted we try it out. I asked for some fresh cuts but was told that my portion was just cut. Highly doubt that cause it was dry as the summer heat in AZ. Also upon tasting the brisket it was pretty much flavorless! Funny because they smoke their meats and should have some Smokey flavor. The sides weren't anything to right home about, greasy ass potatoes that had no garlic flavor and basic macaroni that was probably left over from the day before. The BBQ sauce was straight out of a grocery store brand bottle. Again, nothing special about the meal. I spent/wasted $42 and was extremely disappointed. We should have just stuck with LittleMissBBQ because Scott at LMB knows how to make proper BBQ and all the fixings! Can't Stop Smokin' didn't even smell like they smoked their meats! Go to Rudy's across the street if your in the area and need BBQ or make the trip to LMB!",

After delivering a dog for a rescue, a meal at a new place was required.      We were glad to see they were open so early.      The staff is by far the best part of the experience. Nice rustic decor and a clean eating area.      I got the big sampler platter with some extra ribs so I could try both styles. It also included some Brisket, Sausage, and Pulled Pork. I also had the Coleslaw and Jalapeno Beans and Corn Bread.      The Sausage was lean but bland. The Pulled Pork was also rather bland. Even with a dosing of some type of sauce. It was tender.      The Brisket had a nice smoke bark and was very tender, but again rather bland compared to other places. Basically it didn't have much spice on the outside which means that what on the inside doesn't get anything and taste like plain meat.       The ribs were totally different. Very Tender and they had some good flavor. They still could have had some more spice to them. I wouldn't have complained. Both Baby Back and St. Louis styles had a good amount of meat with most of the fat rendered off. Like any good rib.       Both sauces were good though I'd mix them if you want the best flavor. They should do this for you and have a third sauce.       The Slaw was nice but the star of the meal were the Jalapeno Beans. WOW on flavor, texture and likeability. Always get these.       I will say that if I'm in the area , I'll eat here again, but I wouldn't drive out of my way just for a meal.",

The sides are all good too, especially enjoy the carrots and jala-pintos.  The kids crave the Mac&cheese.  Favorite lunch item: Blazing bowl.  Favorite cobbler: peach (but usually sold-out).    We find CSS a good value for family takeout and have catered two events with them with great satisfaction.    This is delicious, stick to your ribs, comfort food.

I walked in with my daughter, who was excited for some good ribs for lunch, we weren't greated. Then I was confused with the cafeteria-style \"pick your own food\" way. It was confusing, poorly planned and eventually wasn't worth 10% of what was paid. We couldn't even eat it. It was oily, bland and to a hungry stomach=disappointing severely. I wouldn't suggest it and won't even give it a try. Guess I'll try Rudy's next door, it seems more people do, the parking lots always busy.",

So 43% savingsBut when you get there, the picnic pack is only $44.50. It's only a $56 value if you ordered everything separately.  Then, despite the fact the groupon says you get one premium meat and one regular meat, we were told that to get a premium meat like tri-tip, ribs, or brisket it would be an additional $4.

Not busy...but across the street from Rudy's I didn't expect it to be. Food was great.  Way better than Rudy's. The pulled pork was a bit fatty which probably lenses to its great flavor.  The brisket was amazing...tender and juicy.  Can't say enough about good brisket!! Sides were average. This will be our new go to spot for BBQ.",

I ordered that with a side of baked beans, a can of iced tea and a bag of baked chips (the lunch special). The pulled pork had excellent tenderness and a nice smoky flavor. Unfortunately, there was no sauce, so I used the baked beans as the sauciness the sandwich was missing. Everything had really good flavor, but $10+ dollars for lunch seems a bit too high for what you get (I'd suggest switching to bottled drinks, I just can't get behind paying $1.50 for a can of soda).",

All of the meats and sides are laid out cafeteria sytle over steam tables. We were able to sample a few of the meats (anything without a bone) and to be honest I am glad we tried them out because most were not very good, or fresh for that matter. The brisket was pretty bland and had a weird color to it. My guess would be that it was not fresh. The smoked turkey was dry and bland. The tri tip was tasty, marbled with fat and pretty flavorful. I also had the spare ribs which were tender enough but didn't have a very seasoned dry rub.  Maybe they expect you to drown your food in bbq sauce? I however had the slices of meat with a huge salad from their salad bar.    Way too many BBQ joints out there, tried this one and probably wouldn't go back anytime soon.",

I like the Barbecue here, MUCH better than across the street and bigger portions! I went to Rudy's 2x and each time the pulled pork was dry, their chicken was dry as well! The atmosphere at Rudy's is like a Cattle Call! Not really fond of that type of atmosphere myself.   So I tried Can't Stop Smokin, across the street! I WASN'T disappointed! Their Brisket, Spare Ribs and Baby Backs are AWESOME! I really enjoy their pulled pork as well! I would say that even though their sausage is good. I think it could be a bit spicier! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE your food, I just think the sausage could be spicier or have a spicier option! I've had better chicken but it's STILL better than Rudy's!   I enjoy the sit down to eat and relax type of atmosphere. The Cattle Call across the street didn't really impress me! I literally felt like I was being herded. The tables WEREN'T kept up with as people would leave. They wouldn't clean where people just left and others sit down at a dirty table! You DON'T see that at Can't Stop Smokin. The ONLY reason they got 4 stars is because I don't give 5 * for hardly anything!  PLUS, the GREATEST thing about Can't Stop Smokin is they also DELIVER.",

Pull up to an awesome parking spot and open the car door to the smell of stomach-rumbling BBQ. The restaurant door swings open and wow, it smells even better than outside. Wait in line and grab my huge aluminum tray and say:  \"I'll have a pound of the brisket and a pound of ribs please!\"  \"Sorry sir we're out of brisket and ribs.\"  ARE. YOU. FREAKING. KIDDING. ME.  Yes, the BBQ place, the place that specializes in BBQ and only that, is out of BBQ. Not only out of BBQ, but out of BBQ at 6:30 PM on a Saturday night. MIND. BLOWING.

    "text": "I recently decided to give Can't Stop Smokin' a try after hearing good things from a co-worker (and the fact that they were running a Groupon special also helped!). I ordered a family meal to go. The girl who took my order over the phone was pleasant, however she didn't seem very knowledgeable and after I gave her my whole order she said \"Let me make sure we have everything you ordered....we've been running out of stuff a lot lately!\" I feel like that is a really weird thing to tell a customer, but  ok...thanks for checking! I was placed on a short hold and she returned to tell me that YES! they had the 4 things I ordered in stock! Ok, then!  I accidentally pulled into the parking lot of Rudy's barbecue, which is right across the street, and the place was packed! I realized I was in the wrong parking lot and quickly crossed over to Can't Stop Smokin', who's parking lot was completely empty. Bad sign. I entered the restaurant and there was only one other person in there who was placing an order at the meat counter. The man behind the counter seemed bored senseless and was not even attempting to provide any kind of customer service. I stood around for a moment before a girl walked up to a register and asked if she could help me. She was pleasant and quickly went to the back to grab my food. Before she came back, the other customer finished placing his order and his food was brought to the register. The girl subsequently returned with my food but seemed baffled as to why there was someone else's food at the counter. She had to call another worker over to solve the \"dilemma\" and it took both of them to figure out how to proceed. I was finally able to pay (with my Groupon..if not for the fact that I had already purchased the Groupon, I probably would've just went to Rudy's) and sent on my way. While Can't Stop Smokin' is about 10 minutes from my job, it was a 30 minute drive home. Halfway home I thought \"I should probably check to make sure everything I ordered is in this bag!\" (my own fault for not checking at the restaurant, I suppose) and I realized one of my sides wasn't there. I didn't feel like going back, and since I paid with a Groupon, I figured \"Oh well\", but it's a little annoying that I only ordered 4 things and they managed to forget one of them!  All of that being said, the food was pretty good. If I had to recommend a place, I would prefer Joe's Real BBQ or even Famous Dave's over this place, but it wasn't bad food. Had it not been for the quality of the food, I would've only given this place 1 star. But I doubt I'll ever go back...",

For someone who's paleo, having the option of having two heaping sides of collard greens rather than being saddled with french fries and potato salad is a welcomed change. The jerky was meh. My fiance totally dug his cobbler, though. When I'm in the area again, I'll definitely make another stop.",

The staff seemed determined to nickel and dime the customer at every turn, the beef was extremely fatty (about a quarter of the \"sandwich\" was gristle), and the sides (I got the green beans and carrots) were slathered in some kind of very greasy butter and lard combination",

    "text": "Unquestionably, if you want delicious BBQ at a decent price this is the place to visit. Having said that, from the moment you come in to Can't Stop Smoking BBQ you're greeted with a warm welcome from the staff. Furthermore, the food is always excellent and waiting for you, my favorite combo is  # 1 which includes a half chicken with two sides vegetables and a beverage of your choice, at a price of $7.00 without the Jalapeno bread since I'm trying to eat healthier.  Moreover, if you're a repeat costumer make sure to get your discount card, that allows you to get a FREE meal on your 8th visit. Needless to say, we have tried other BBQ's around Phoenix, and for the value and Delicious food this is the one to visit.",

    "text": "Good overall BBQ place, surprising that there is a chain from NM. They have good lunch and plates deals that makes it cheaper than Rudys next door. Carnitas were good as well as ribs and pulled pork. Its nice to add a desert as well to a plate to make a well rounded meal. Nothing outstanding but good place. I believe it was a village inn before so not too big.  Still think its crazy that they basically opened the same time as Rudys right next door",

    "text": "We LOVE Can't Stop Smokin'!  My husband is a professional chef and their BBQ runs neck and neck with his!  I always have the brisket because I'm hooked.  He has tried other meats and says they are all delicious.  Their apple cobbler is yummy, too. How people can rate them less than a 4 or unfavorably is beyond me.  We have been going there since it opened and have never been disappointed with anything.  We go there at least twice a month and look forward to it every time.  Their staff recognizes us and makes us feel very welcome. For those who say Rudy's is better, it may be because it's a chain restaurant and more well-known.  People need to give Can't Stop Smokin' a try.  They'll be pleasantly surprised.  We did, and Can't Stop Smokin' has won us as loyal diners.  We spread the word whenever and wherever.",

For some reason this place has almost no line, AND has WAY better food, lower prices, and chiller atmosphere. I've been here twice so far and tried the pull pork, tri-tip, beans, and cobler, and all were amazing!! As far as I can tell, its better in every way, but everyone goes to Rudy's instead. I don't understand, but I'm going to keep going to this place, and hope the line stays short.",

We are very pleased with our decision to do business with them.!!",

I felt obligated to give this place a try. Other than the more private seating, a very nice staff, it seemed to have more side options and combos......IT JUST WASNT AS GOOD. Quality seemed as if it was frozen food and then heated. Also the sauces arent the best.  Give it a try if there is a wait at rudys",

    "text": "We recently visited and thought the food was pretty yummy.  We had the brisket and pulled pork.  I also got the pinto beans and green beans. The pulled pork was flavorful and juicy.  The brisket had a pretty good smoke flavor going and was tender, but a little dry.  They need to work on their technique with the brisket. I come from Southern roots and like my pinto's spicy, but not my green beans.That must be a New Mexico thing  But they were both tasty. Hubby got the mustard greens and thought they were good too. For dessert, we had the homemade peach pie - it was heaven!! We were told they are made on the premises and it was delicious.  I am not kidding, the pie is heaven! I didn't mind the cookie sheets for trays and didn't need a menu in line. Unfortunately, Rudy's (had Rudy's in TX and it was okay) opened next door and seems to drawing business away from here (had Rudy's in TX and it was just okay).  I hope Can't Stop Smokin' can hang in there.",
