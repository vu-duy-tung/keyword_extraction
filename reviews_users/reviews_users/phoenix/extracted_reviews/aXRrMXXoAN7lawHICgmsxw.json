The atmosphere and ambient has a very modern/hipster feel (which I love). The menus is simple yet you have a variety of foods that will cater to just about anyone.  Our waiter described the menu as a \"scale above street truck food\" which to an extent, I agreed...  However, in my personal opinion I felt that the food was so much more. The food was fresh, well seasoned, and just tasty. We had the ceviche tostadas, burger, fish tacos, and finished off with the churro ice cream sandwich. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant.",

Some of the group had cocktails, including the one that blended Mexican Coke, iced coffee, and tequila: amazing. I can't recommend this enough.

Miso slaw ($3) also a winner. Fish tacos and soba noodles were spot on. This is a place I'll most definitely be returning to despite the many dining options downtown.",

Although there wasn't a lot of indoor seating there seemed to be more outside (if only it wasn't so hot this time of year!). Myself and a friend sat at the bar top and enjoyed watching three men cook right in front of us in the tiny kitchen. I tried the 2 fish tacos and the ceviche salad. Both were very good. I really liked how unique and fresh the salad was. The tacos were good and simple, but could have used some more seasoning or flavor.",

If they're any indication of the rest of the food than everything is a must-try.   Take a moment to ask yourself, what makes a good burger joint? Have a few ideas in your head?   Is it the quality of the meat? Quality of the fries? Whether the place has a unique twist? Good Service? Consistency?  I'm here to tell you The Dressing Room has all of that. Any burger spot can have a home run on a given night only for them to strike out on your next visit. I've been here on at least 5 separate occasions, and it has rocked me EVERY SINGLE TIME. I honestly can't tout that level of consistency about any other burger spot in Phoenix or anywhere else for that matter.  Only con I can think of is the parking situation, but that's easy to get over after you've tasted the food and experienced the fantastic level of service.   I'm sure if I asked you for your favorite burger joint, you'd have a name in mind. If you live in Phoenix, you should be skeptical of that top spot until you've tried The Dressing Room.",

    "text": "I specifically came here to try their churro ice cream sandwich after reading a Phoenix New Times post that raves about them. Unfortunately I didn't hold the same feelings they did. The churro was missing cinnamon, and was so thin that it became crispy all the way through, instead of having that doughey middle that churros are meant to have. And the vanilla ice cream needed more vanilla. It tasted like only cream. I'll come back here to try their food because some of it sounds interesting.",

    "text": "I have eaten here a couple years ago with friends and it was delightful. At the time, the vegetarian option available was a delicious veggie taco that was to die for. My friends enjoyed their meals as well and we all shared an amazing churro ice cream sandwich. It's a small space but hip and elegant. A couple months ago, I was so excited to go there to eat that vegetarian option, only to sit down and see the menu changed entirely. The veggie taco now had seafood. I asked the lovely server if it were possible to make the taco vegetarian again and was told no. She explained that everything on the menu had changed except 2 options. I couldn't find anything on the menu that was vegetarian friendly aside from a chilled pad thai salad which didn't seem filling or offer the same kind of warm comfort I was looking for. We had to leave because... a girl's gotta eat. I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed that this would change because it was the ONE vegetarian friendly item on the whole menu and it was GOOD. In a hip area of Phoenix in 2019, you would think there would be at least one meatless option. Hopefully this doesn't last long, but until it does I sadly won't dine there anymore. Still giving the restaurant 3 stars because they do a fabulous job otherwise and my precious experiences were great.",

    "text": "Modern and industrial neighborhood gem on Roosevelt. This spot has quickly become a favorite of mine and as reluctant as I am to share with the masses, it deserves to be enjoyed by many. And let's be real, I need this place to thrive so I have a place to go on my afternoons. I'll cut to the goodies you want (why we all yelp in the first place...)  Reasons why I love this place:  - Consistent and attentive (without bugging) service. From my very first visit, I was treated like a friend coming over for a drink. I feel comfortable coming here alone to work and study and never feel rushed. Food comes up quickly and thus far, I've never had something I didn't like and never had an order arrive wrong.  - EXCELLENT FOOD AND COCKTAILS! Seriously. Try the Roro burger or fish tacos. TBH, everything is delicious AF. Can't go wrong. Sauces are flavor-packed, food is cooked to order, and is plated (or basketed?) with care. It's in the little details here and they've impressed me with their attention to them.  - A REAL Happy hour. None of that \"we just have a drink special or $1 off wells/ tap/ etc.\" They do half off all alcoholic beverages including ALL of their lovely cocktails! I've always been meh about Paloma's but this place has made me fall in love with them. Happy hour is from open to 6pm I believe.  - The atmosphere. Interesting music, small business feel, beautiful patio, simple and cute plant-based centerpieces. If you sit at the bar (you may find me there) it feels like you have a coveted kitchen seat with prime access to the bartender.   TLDR. Eat here. Drink Here. You'll Enjoy it.",

We ate outside on the patio, and fell in love with the atmosphere too. For balance sake, I'll mention this: the two different cocktails I had were a little sweet for dinner. Both would make excellent brunch drinks. I had something called a \"C. V.\" something with tequila--my drug of choice, and a bourbon drink with sage. Delicious, but better for brunch. I can and will walk over to this outstanding eatery often.",

I would eat this again and I would be willing to try everything else on the menu. They know what they are doing at this place. My boyfriend ordered the fried shrimp and fries along with the homemade pickles, all of which I sampled. The aioli was not spicy but delicious, the way they fried their food tasted amazing.

Both of them said theirs was excellent and one of them is a picky eater so it must have been good. I tried the fries that came with the burger and they were great! Salty, but not too salty and a unique flavor that was good. Kinda of a dill flavor but not a pickle flavor. I will get those on the side next time because my fish tacos did not have any. :( The vibe was cool and hip. Loved that you can see them make your food.

I shop for my own household and often have to throw food away. Every time I do - a little piece of me dies.   I can't imagine what that does to the bottom line for a restaurant. So I empathize with you. That said ... shouldn't the remaining ingredients really shine on the dish?? Shouldn't the few things you do, be done REALLY well??   These avacado's should never have seen the plate...can you honestly disagree with that ?   They were in the ceviche dish that used to bring us to your spot. You know the one ....it had toasted seeds and hominy, pickled onions ...now it's just sad   I'd far prefer paying more for the same dish versus paying the same price for a poor substitute.  You can't win them all...but for a mid afternoon service on a Thursday before dinner this dish simply fell short",

I have been meaning to get back to this place after a wonderful experience when they first opened and since I've always recommended and wanted to go back. I was so embarrassed when we took my sister in law. It was some of the worst hipster service and just blah food I've had in a long time.   First, it took about 20 minutes for someone to come over and get our drink order. The cocktail I had was super delicious (one if not the only high note to our experience) but the canned beer my sister in law ordered was room temperature. It took another 40 minutes for them to come back and take our order. I had to go to the girl that was busing other tables to ask if our server could stop by since we were ready to order. I totally get when the place is packed and the servers are visibly busy but the place was really, not that busy. We had to ask for silverware and our second round of drinks and basically beg for someone to take our credit cards so we could get out of there.  The food: My fish tacos were super fishy and way too breaded. There was just nothing great about them.  My husband ordered the burger and seriously the burger we had there when they first opened was one of the best I'd ever had. This one was again just meh with a soggy bun and cold fries.   I hate to see a good place go downhill like this. I hope they vet their servers a bit better and hire people on their staff that actually give a sh*t because the overall feel felt just like that: a bunch of people who didn't give a sh*t. I hope they figure it out and bring back the service and food we used to rave about. Until then, we will not be back.",

He enjoyed both.  Food: Oh, yea, that....We enjoyed the Bulgogi Gyoza, and the Chorizo Poutine.  We ate all of it. Yum. I felt like, since the Poutine was not discounted for HH, they were a bit skimpy on the Chorizo, but having said that, we did eat all of it!!!! Service was GOLD STAR. It was evident that there is a team ethic in this joint. Our waiter was great, and when he was busy, other staff picked up the slack. One, very kind woman, who may have been a manager, kept coming to the table to make sure that we ere happy. Customer service here was great! Food was prepared well, and the HH drink prices were really reasonable. I will be back. If your goal is to eat inexpensively, the food was not HH prices, but for us, the cost of drinks evened the bill to a very happy munching experience. Increased bar space and more choriz would have landed them a 5 star.",

We shared some apps, had some drinks, and pretty much all ordered the same entrees... fish tacos. Per other Yelp reviews, these were an AWESOME choice. My mother, a fish taco snob, even approved with a 10/10. We will definitely be back for another good time!",

The flavors just melt in your mouth and I s very filling.  The service was great as well, the young man that helped us made sure to keep the water cups full, it was 115 outside so that was really nice and cooled things off.

We started off with their chorizo poutine which sounded like it would be really good and different but it just wasn't working. They put this chili/tangy seasoning on their fries that I think they should put a stop to asap. I think it completely overpowers the flavor of the fries and anything else that goes on the fries. The chorizo poutine was not exactly what I was picturing. It was more of a chorizo dip over the fries. I did really like the cheese curds though. We also ordered the fried chicken sandwich. I think that the oil that they fried the chicken in was not hot enough because the outside did not get that crispy and you could taste the fryer oil on the coating itself. I just wasn't a big fan overall of the food that we ordered and on top of that the service was pretty slow for it not being that busy. I might come back and try other things on the menu, but I was pretty disappointed with the stuff that I did try.",

Researched a month in advance to find a spot that could accommodate the varying dietary requirements in our party so that we could stop off for a good, quality meal after arriving from a 6 hour Maui flight and was open late enough. After getting in at the airport I called to confirm that they were open til 10, and the gal said yes but that they were filled up inside but had patio seating,  although things may clear out by the time we got there, which was at 935.  Dropped hubby off to get a table while the rest of us parked and he gets told by the hostess/waitress with the Crazy Eyebrows that it's Last Call in 10 mins and that maybe we should go to this other place across the street instead \"because they have more choices\" even though I had already told her I researched in depth as far as menu goes...as I'm explaining to her that I called beforehand to make sure they were open til 10, she goes \"now Last  Call is in 3 minutes\" and is just being very rude and giving us attitude, like she had somewhere to go and didn't want to take any more customers. I was THIS CLOSE to popping her on her overdrawn thick eyebrows when we just decided to go across the street to THE WILDERNESS where we were welcomed and had some pretty delicious food!  The Dressing Room needs to learn how to live up to their HYPE and train their staff to be more welcoming and customer-focused!",

Joseph, for someone who writes reviews, you would think you'd have the common sense to look up the place you're going to before you go there. That's the point of yelp, so you're complaints about the menu are obnoxious because HAD YOU LOOKED IT UP LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, you would of been able to see their menu. Don't leave bad reviews based on your own diet preferences that could have easily been avoided. Clearly you don't know how yelp or the internet works. As for the veggie tacos, which I ordered (heyy vegetarians!) they're delicious. It's not a blob of cheese. They come topped with the avocado crema, pico de Gallo, Peruvian corn, and YES, those are sweet potatoes. Also clearly stated on the menu. All of the flavors paired really nicely, and the cheese wasn't cold AT ALL. The fries get a lot of hype here and I can see why, they were perfect. The avocado crema (that Evan whined about not standing out) I thought was great. How high were your expectations for avocado... and sour cream? Our waiter answered all of our questions, which we didn't have many of considering the menu isn't very big and if you can read it's pretty self explanatory.. he gave great drink recommendations and sat at the table next to us to take our order rather than stand above us. Appreciated, great demeanor. The waitress who seated us was very friendly as well and even answered questions for some visitors walking down the back alley who after that came in to eat. The music in the background was really fun as well, I definitely recommend stopping by if you're visiting the area or if you're just looking for a place to pop In for lunch. They've got one of the best happy hours I've seen, EVERYDAY 11-6 and the entire staff smiles and greets you.",

Definitely a cheat meal/ very heavy, but worth the splurge. Super juicy and saucy. The English muffin bun definitely makes the burger hold up well.

The menu was simple, clean and prices were too fair for the quality of the food and service.  The mixed drinks they serve are perfect and tasty!

    "text": "Those of you who follow my reviews know that I do not like paying for atmosphere when I'm buying food, but I'm going to make an exception this time - this is place is cool.  It's like eating in an art gallery (in fact, it IS eating in an art gallery). It is interesting and fun. Our visit came at the end of a long day and we were very quickly comfortable and relaxed.  The menu is limited but everything we had was healthy and yummy.  My burger was served on fresh bread. My salad was fresh. They have a small but good selection of beers on tap. To be honest, none of the food was particularly memorable, but it was healthy and filling. The (salt and vinegar?) fries were a bit too sour, but everything else at our table was fine. Cost was reasonable - they could mark it up more to reflect the atmosphere, but they don't, which is admirable.  I'm only giving them four stars though because they are trying just a bit too hard to be trendy - Portland style. I really don't need to hear the whole story of where every component of my meal came from. Just tell me what's good and I'll give it a try.",

    "text": "So let's start off with Peruvian corn. I'm doubtful they are buying it fresh on the cob.  It seems like a fancy name for hominy I know isn't. And I know the chef probably pulls his hair out when guys like me call it hominy, but, Peruvian corn is kind of a deal to get... kind of. ANYWAYS... This place is really cool. It's a hip location on or near Roosevelt Row, or whatever they are calling that Roosevelt area now. At 1st I was a little worried about it being a hipster hangout that was too cool for a dad in his 40s... but I was wrong!!! I mean it IS too cool for a dad in his 40s BUT they didn't care...  They have a nice little menu. The place is clean and the staff is beyond friendly! God that makes a huge difference!!! Yeah, I'm talking to you LUX. What a novel concept to have your employees actually seem HAPPY to see customers! The other nice thing is they have an easy to pronounce menu! Veggie Tacos. How easy is that. Veggie Tacos. I was at a place last week and they has a dish call Colachita... Cola Chita? Co La Chita. Co Lachi ta? I wanted to try it but didn't... I'm perfectly capable of making ass out of myself. I don't help from some trendy menu.  Moving along The veggie tacos are really, really, really good. Like great. I'm impressed. IDK if I'm impressed with the fact that the chef makes everyone call him \"Chef\", but whatever. Some people need that. If it's just in front of guests I suppose I get it.  So to summarize this long winded A.D.D. review, go there and check it out. Definitely and cool little place.",

My fiance ordered this new drink, a cocktail they just invented, Winter Collins. You just have to come here and experience it yourself.   You will not be sorry!  Some place do a well job. This place knocks the ball out of the park. Total home run!  Last but not least....yeah there is more. The home made churro and ice cream sandwich is to DIE for.

When one walks in they are met with a typical New York over priced hole in the wall, but with just a few more steps you are led into an industrial art gallery for your viewing pleasure while you wait. When you are taken to your seats, you find that it's not over priced at all. It's small menu makes quick of a usually long and arduous process of food selection. Like the art gallery the food was nicely arranged, pleasing to the eye and tongue. Additionally, the mood was set by the authentic Arizonan table cactus (watch out folks, they really poke), distressed wood tables, and sliding barn doors. Buckle up, what a culinary adventure this one is.",

It's a small place with an open kitchen and a very chill downtown Phoenix vibe. Our server, Taylee, was great, super attentive and very sweet. The drink menu is brief, but good, interesting drinks without going too wacky. And the food... oh the food. I think the RoRo burger is my favorite burger in the valley. Perfect combination of tang, spice and a delicious patty. The fries are cooked so well and have a very interesting and tasty seasoning. You can order them with an aioli that takes it to another level. The only dessert option is the churro ice cream sandwich. It is so good that you won't want any other option anyway. Two cookie shaped, well made churros with delicious ice cream in between. Basically, I'm already dreaming about going back!",

They decor is modern yet maintains the rustic appeal of the original building. The far wall they have opened up into the adjoining space, which includes seating in the art gallery and allows ventilation and sound dispersion. Brilliant!  The service was very friendly and unpretentious. Great music. The Roro burgers and fries were exceptional and fresh. The draft beer and cocktail selection was also great for such a small place. The enclosed back patio, adjacent to the food-prep trailer, would be great during cooler weather. Overall, this gem is a great addition to the Roosevelt Row area.",

A generous tip is a must because it's a ballet of cooperation among the staff. They keep it casual and conversational while turning out fantastic food. You can tell they each care about everything that passes over the counter. Order anything that catches your eye and don't fear asking for help.   Let them challenge you with drinks you didn't know existed. Peruvian, Filipino, Portlandian, German? Get crazy, they are ready.",

    "text": "It was our first time in this part of Phoenix. We were just passing by and didn't even have a chance to check on Yelp for any references about this place. So, our opinion was not affected by any one or anything. Place has very urban dwelling industrial vibe. We were seated in the backyard. There is a kitchen in the back which is made out of shipping container. But do not take me wrong: there is nothing tasteless about this place. As the matter of fact every single detail and corner was thought through. Even bathroom has absolutely groovy details and fixtures.  Service: friendly, accommodating and very fast.   There were customers that were obviously return customers. They would order food right away without even looking at the menu. So, we didn't know what we are getting ourself into and took a leap of faith. My hubby ordered RoRo burger, my daughter ordered shrimp and chips, I ordered TJ Tacos and Cold Soba Salad.  All portions were great size. Just a salad for me would be plenty, we splinted. TJ Tacos between all of us because I just couldn't eat everything myself :) Everything was very very very fresh and flavorful. We are definitely coming back! See my photos. You will not be able to resist it. Great find on our part! Great lunch. See my other review for the coffee shop next door to this place. Also worth your time and attention.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try out this venue. I had heard nothing but great things. I invited a friend of mine who's now writing for a local food column and i though she'd enjoy. I arrived 15 min early to have a beer and i sat at the bar and was politely greeted by some awesome guys who seemed to be working the grill station and another making drinks, he got me two waters and went though the beers with me, I'm a fan of sours so the boisenberry suited me well. He has asked a server to get me menus but she seems extremely disinterested so much to the fact she gave me two drink menus and not food. After borrowing a menu from the gentleman next to me my friend arrived. Our server checked on everyone around ya but never spoke to us again, she finally came back directly infront of us to get something and we asked if we can order she responded with \" what do you want \" in an extremely annoyed tone. After bringing us our food, she never came back to see if we needed anything. Never refilled waters and never asked if i wanted another beer. It was just absolutely embarrassing. I finally asked my friend if she was ready to go and she said she was still hungry so she waited for the server to arrive again and she asked to see a food menu, the server brought a menu and the bill!! She was pretty much telling us to leave. My friend was completely taken back and felt as if we weren't wanted there. Not to mention it's a middle eastern woman and an African Americans woman visiting this establishment, and the most upsetting part about it is seeing my friend visibly welling up with tears with how this server has treated us... the server comes backs and we have both placed our cards inside the folded bill she gave us. And she left one card there and sped off with one.. she comes back and i kindly asked if she split the bill. She rudely reaches over and snatched the second card she left said she would void the transaction and run both cards... my friend began asking her for the receipt for the voided transaction and she just walked away!! Sent over some guy who explained he just refunded her half the amount and charged the other card which was completely fine but it was the way the female staff treated the two of us that was NOT. Prior to her inserting herself into the situation I was having a really good experience. Not quite sure why she was so unbelievably rude to my friend, and I hope she doesn't treat any other patrons that may not look like her typically customer in a rude manner. The two stars is for the falafel gyro and fish tacos other than that. Pfff!",

It's a little place that doesn't look like much from the street but don't let that stop you. It's got a great feel and the staff is great. The All Day Burrito was one of the best things I've tasted and the salsa that came with it is a must. Something else I appreciated was that upon returning after paying my tab the gentleman addressed me by name and thanked me for coming in. I don't know why more waitstaff and restaurants don't do this. It's a little thing that makes a big difference, and I appreciated it.",

Both were superbly made by the friendly bartender, Kevin. We decided on the Korean Fried Rice and Roro Burger and split both.

    "text": "Finally made it to the latest iteration of The Dressing Room! In a past life, it was a dusty parking lot and a rehearsal space for local indie bands. It retained the same name, but like everything else around here, you couldn't tell it wasn't part of Phoenix history.   Yes, 2010 feels like history to me.   Anyway, I visited with some good friends and decided nothing was more apt than the RoRo burger. Don't let the fact it's on an English muffin fool you--it is a formidable portion. And although I was left wanting for the 'buns' on this to be a little more toasty, and the dish itself a little less juicy--it was just fine. Step aside, cheddar, Gruyere may be the ideal cheese for burgers. The fries tasted faintly of chili and so strongly of lemon you may pucker. I haven't had any like them, but they are thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless.   You won't be disappointed with the brief cocktail menu (get The Snoop!) or beer rotation. You definitely won't be disappointed with their modest prices--much of the menu is under 11 dollars for a great meal. With the weather cooling down, treat yourself to a nice, casual dinner on the patio. I doubt you'll leave with any regrets!",

If you like bourbon with an added sweetness, I would suggest the Rosemary & the Sage, and if you like a creamy cocktail that reminds you of your daily coffeeshop order, I suggest the latter.   For food, I ordered the Cold Soba Noodles. Wow - it was so good. The bowl had (obviously) soba noodles, a soft boiled egg, grated carrot, some slices of avocado, red cabbage, snap peas, and seaweed. All the flavors blended really nicely together.   The server accidentally gave us another table's check, but once he realized he gave us a refund and our actual check back. The waiters were really kind and handled the situation very well.  Side note: The way I tell that a restaurant is a place I want to go back to is how clean the restroom is. It was clean and modern, and 10/10.",

    "text": "This appears to be a hip spot near downtown Phoenix for the foodie types. I did not care for the menu choices hence my low rating. Quality is probably better than here stars, but I was not interested in returning after my dinner. I do not eat cows, and I was not in the mood for seafood, so I was stuck with some veggie tacos.   Your best bet is to come with a mild appetite and someone you would like to have a few cocktails with. If you can drink and split a basket of fries, you might love the place. Fries here are among the best I ever ate -- crispy, well seasoned, and appropriately splashed with tangy vinegar.   The tacos I had were not good. There was a fried block of cheese in each one. They were filled with chunks of sweet potato, or at least I think it was.   The patio was delightful with flora and art. There is a gallery of some sort attached to the indoor seating area with a coffee shop in between.",

It'd be nice if they had a little tahini or something to make it less dry.  The drinks are really good and the atmosphere was nice and the service was really good too.  I probably won't be coming back very frequently without more vegan options, but it was a very good place for a group of people and the non-vegans in my group really enjoyed what they had.",

During our last visit we got some fries that we really enjoyed. They were crispy and had a unique light lemon flavor. The drinks are innovative and layered with a complex flavor profile. My favorite beverage is the peppered flower. The gin and elderflower go lovely together and when blended with egg whites the texture becomes so creamy. We got the fish tacos and shrimp with chips. I was a little dissatisfied with the shrimp, It was beer battered and fried however not very crunchy. The aioli served with it was ok, but the spicy Russian dressing is to die for. We always ask for it on the side. It's creamy and spicy and complements everything.",

So we sat on the patio, and it's got a really cool urban vibe, I over heard someone say it's called the dressing room because it used to be a dressing room for a drag show/bar which I thought was cool. Now to the good stuff...the menu is small but I feel like they are very creative and what they do have they do extremely well .....consistency is key  I had the classic burger and I didn't have time to take a picture because I was busy stuffing it in my face, it was delicious. I also had the spiked chai which was also very good...and very strong  my husband had the big burrito..eggs, bacon, potatoes, corn and cheese...he was in heaven...all his favorite things in burrito form. Last but DEFINITELY not least, the churro ice cream sandwich....I can only say it's a delicious experience....that's it no other words. Run don't walk to the dressing room, you can thank me later.",

We had the TJ tacos and it's fair to say they are my favorite fish tacos I've ever had. The fries? Amazing. Shrimp and chips? A must have. Even the Korean Skewers blew me away. Seeing as that's half the menu right there, it's safe to say you can't go wrong with any of the food, or beverage, items here. I'm already looking forward to going back.",

My friend Victoria and I had their green tea iced tea, C&V Paloma (absolutely delicious!!!), Chicho Morado (an unique purple corn diffused drink- very refreshing!), cold soba salad, Korean style yakitori & TJ taco.   We ate family style & shared everything. The food concept is \"global food truck\" and there is a bit of something to appeal to everyone's tastes. It's simple and fresh. There is very little chance of not getting a good meal with a concept like this, executed by a friendly staff is sure to make this restaurant a local favorite and a place to stop on First Friday's.

Happy hour was in play, so I had the Snoop cocktail which was very refreshing.   We ordered a variety of food: RoRo burger, Korean fried rice, breakfast burrito & the egg sandwich.  Everything we tried was fantastic.  I had the RoRo burger and it was delicious...still trying to figure out what seasoning they use on the fries. Yummy!  I will definitely return.",

    "text": "We've been to The Dressing Room a couple of times to hang out and have really enjoyed it! The first time we were there, we didn't realize they have a long Happy Hour (from 11am - 6pm) featuring 1/2 off wine, beer, and cocktails; we've gone back since to take advantage of the deal!  I've enjoyed the C&V Paloma every time - Tequila, Fresh Grapefruit, Lime, Vanilla, and Cinnamon - super delish & quite refreshing especially for the summer! They also have a non-alcholic drink, the Chicha Morada, listed as a Homemade Peruvian spiced purple corn drink which is tasty & also refreshing.  Their food menu is smaller but we've liked the items we've gotten so far - TJ Tacos, RoRo Burger, and Shrimp & Chips. The TJ Tacos have been my favorite; the fish was fried crispy and the cabbage, pico, and avocado crema were the perfect toppings. Highly recommended! I liked the Shrimp due the batter they were fried in but that wasn't my favorite. My husband liked the RoRo Burger, it was packed with the toppings which made it tasty. Their fries are seasoned with tajin & come with a choice of side sauce which are good too!  The only drawback is that the inside of the restaurant is small, not ideal for a large group. They do have more seating on their patio however! Overall, cute little place worth stopping by.",

I ordered the fish tacos, fries and a Bloody Mary. The fish tacos were pretty good, not the best I've ever had but the fries were delicious. They bring out three types of sauces for the fries and they were all delicious. The Bloody Mary was also pretty good, a little watered down but still good.  The service was really good, and we were there during happy hour so all of our drinks were discounted. 2 meals, and multiple drinks for $35...not too shabby",

Our server was great: friendly, chill, and quick.  I had the RoRo burger which was delicious.  That english muffin bread idea is the best ever!  Our tostadas with both the pico and the ceviche appetizers were perfectly crunchy and freshly fried and salted.. yummmm.  My friends cheese tacos were ginormous but they looked very yummy from my angle :P  We had their grapefruit cocktail for $5 which was a SUPER deal.. I think I had two???  I really appreciated that the owner or manager or whoever the two men were, stopped by and not just asked how we were but legitimately had an enjoyable two-way conversation with us... that was really nice to feel that welcomed.    I came back a second time and had the tacos and very very much enjoyed them as a light lunch... we will def be back again, friends!",

The event was put on by Babe Council and was from 11-3. The venue spot was perfect for us. It was clean & spacious. The staff was very friendly & the food was delish! We even had our Veuve Rose served. The UBS blood bus was able to pull up right out back for everyone to donate. We are Boss Babes doing Boss Things.....for others! #BabeCouncil2017",

I've been here on several occasions, mostly on weekends until most recently on a Tuesday. We came for a taco Tuesday celebration and although they did not have any specialty pricing outside of their regular happy hour deals we still enjoyed ourselves. I got the rosemary and sage cocktail which is well balanced between the bourbon and rosemary and not overly sweet or herby. We got a plate of fries for the table with their spicy Russian sauce which was delicious. The fries were perfectly crispy, not overly greasy and seasoned well. The spicy Russian sauce isn't too spicy but well balanced flavor to accompany the fries. As an entree I chose the TJ tacos which are their take on fish tacos which were delicious! They were topped with avocado and the fish seemed to be freshly fried because the tacos were perfect. Been here several times and the TJ tacos never disappoint!",

Anyway, the happy hour deals here can't be missed - half off everything basically - so we stopped by for drinks and a snack before dinner. We ordered the fries which came with a sauce, and the four of us ordered drinks. We particularly enjoyed the spiked chai and the peppered flower, though one of my friends' chai was way too strong (too much rum). We convinced her to ask for a little more chai concentrate to go in it, and our server obliged, which made it much better.   We ordered more fries (they were delicious, but we definitely needed more for the four of us, and the baskets were cheap) and without asking, our server brought us all three sauces instead of just one, possibly because he heard that we could decide which one we really wanted. Overall this was a really great way to spend happy hour with friends. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of DTPHX, The Dressing Room is a bright addition on Roosevelt St. I work nearby and had lunch here on a weekday. We got the All Day Burrito, Cold Coba Salad, and Churro Ice Cream Sandy for dessert. The All Day Burrito was delicious & a good portion size for lunch - not too big or too small - and the salad was also yummy. My fave part though, without a doubt, was the churro ice cream dessert! The presentation was adorable but it tasted even better, especially with the warm churro and the ice cream... YUM.  For a quiet weekday, service was great. There are some seats in the small area inside and a back patio. Parking, like many places downtown, is scarce. There are metered parking on the street or this tiny lot behind the restaurant (less than 5 spots if they're not already taken). My only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger menu with more selections! Definitely wouldn't mind coming back here again to try their drinks and other items.",

I had stopped into Be coffee, food, and stuff {same owner} to work for a little bit and when I got hungry, decided to try it's BRAND NEW sister restaurant next door! There is a door connecting the two places which it totally cool. I LOVE the decor, cute little patio, and great little bar where you can watch the chefs cook. It is pretty small so not great for big groups but definitely good for a date night or client lunch! They have Happy Hour specials EVERY DAY from 11 AM - 6 PM with half off of cocktails. How can you beat that?! And let me tell you, the cocktail menu looked incredible!   For lunch, I ordered their cold soba salad with a Yakitori steak skewer because they looked so tasty. The salad was nice and refreshing! It had pickled cucumbers, ginger, carrots, onions, sesame seeds, a soft boiled egg, avocado, seaweed, and i'm sure i'm missing things! It was topped with a light miso dressing. It was a TAD fishy for me but this isn't saying much because i'm super sensitive to fishy things. It is probably supposed to be this way! THE SKEWER - YES. The flavor was incredible and I will 100% order these the next time that I come. So yum!   All in all, this is a great new addition to the Downtown Phoenix foodie scene! Definitely pay them a visit!",

Our friend ordered the All Day Burrito and absolutely loved it, licked his fingers and was ready to order a second one loved it so much! My husband ordered the RoRo burger with fries and tried one of the fancy dipping sauces. I had the shrimp and chips and found it to be the perfect portion and the shrimps were plump and flavorful. Our other friend ordered the ceviche salad and enjoyed the creative interpretation. Our waitress got busy but received some amazing support from one of the restaurant directors who made our day! the cocktails were creative and delicious. Happy hour prices are amazing.

He interior is shared with a coffee house, plant shop, art gallery, and co-working space. Very interesting concept.",

Great attention to detail - fresh flower twigs on the tables and speakers in the trees. Staff was friendly and the food was amazing. We got drinks on happy hour -$5 cocktails. We had the whiskey rosemary. It was well made and refreshing. The soba noodle salad was as amazing as the juicy burger.  I loved the English muffin bun. Their fries were also delicious served with specialty dipping sauce. High food quality and reasonably priced. We will visit again.",

They were all very sweet, playful, and amazing throughout our time that night. I highly recommend coming here for their drinks, food, atmosphere, and awesome staff!!!",

Dressing Room combines inspiration from around the world (at least I counted Korea, Canada, the States, and Mexico, which is still broad by any measure) to create fanciful, fun, and, most importantly, delicious snacks, meals, and drinks.   As for ambiance, the small front patio is tastefully done and the location is hard to beat.  Pro-tip: park on Portland, which is only one block north, to avoid paying for parking.",

First of all, their daily (yes, daily!) happy hour is from 11-6. They were very busy, which I took as a good sign. There isn't a lot of seating inside, and it was super hot outside, so not many were willing to take a seat on their patio. However, they do have a fan system that seemed to keep it cool enough, and the patio is small but cute. I was able to grab a seat at the bar. I had the falafel gyro, and on my next visits tried the chilled pad thai salad and guacamole tostada. I wanted to try the Korean fried rice, but had the falafel again. Even though they were busy every time I went, they were always friendly and attentive not only to guests but to each other. Overall, good vibes here! I cannot visit Phoenix again without going here.",

The Avocado Crema was okay, it tasted like something around mayo, yogurt, or sour cream with a hint of avocado. Wish the avocado flavor was much stronger.  Also, service was excellent, probably the best part of the experience.

    "text": "I write this review with some reservation.  My reservation is because the young woman who waited on me (at the bar) for a late night dinner was terrific. She was cordial, helpful and generally wonderful, Best service in a long time. She, when asked, also recommended two dishes that I had seen other Yelpers make very positive comments about. I went with her recommendations.  Gyoza - Pot Stickers  Nice taste and texture, although could not discern the ingredients, but they were served cold inside and I saw them coming off of the grill, so I know they just weren't cooked long enough. Really unforgivable to be cold inside.   Fried Rice  The fried egg on top made it unique and different than most. The texture of the rice was not to my liking (too moist) and it had almost no taste at all, except for a bit of \"heat,\" apparently from an imported pepper, according to my server. All in all VERY disappointing. Kind of reminded me of an old joke: \"not very good food, but there was a lot of it.\"  So FIVE STARS for service, in a relatively pleasant environment, and NO STARS for food quality. Obviously I will not be returning for a second chance, as there are just too many other terrific options.",

Perfectly cooked and seasoned fries with their own in house sauce, great combination. Their shrimp tacos were so good here, all of the toppings were fresh ! We felt the tacos needed an extra kick, so we use some of their sriracha sauce on top. Thank me later ! We lucked up and visited during happy hour. All of their signature drinks were like 6 bucks ! And man were they good, different and strong ! Check out this gem  in downtown Phoenix! They also have a little art gallery that you can browse while you wait for your food, so cool! Outside seating with heaters, make for a very nice ambiance.",

    "text": "What a cool spot! After checking out the art museum, we relied on good old yelp to find us a place for lunch. The glowing reviews lead us here and we were so happy they did!  Upon entering the establishment from the heat of summer, it was refreshingly cool inside. Ahhhhhh. We were promptly seated at a table and asked if we had been there before. Our server was super nice and went over the menu with us. She also let us know about the fried chicken special that day... something about being soaked in Mexican coca-cola then breaded, topped with slaw and served on a bun with fries. I couldn't remember the rest of the specifics but it sounded amazing.   The menu isn't huge but has a nice variety of items. Cocktails sounded good and a few rather unique. We stuck with sprite (in a bottle of course) and their green iced tea. Waters were delivered as soon as we sat down too. Most tables were full but it didn't seem overwhelmingly packed for a Saturday around noon. Chill vibe.   I ended up ordering the fried chicken special, and my girlfriend got a plain cheeseburger. She enjoyed the burger and I was in heaven with my chicken.   It has just the right flavor.. a slight kick but nothing excessive, and the slaw was awesome. Their fries were also to die for.. whatever the seasoning is, I am obsessed. I'm so delicious and hardly needed ketchup or anything.   Our server remained super attentive, refilling drinks and checking in on us.   Overall cool vibe and great meal. I'd love to return when it's cooler to sit on the patio. Prices were reasonable as well.",

We arrived before happy hour had wrapped up and were able to order a couple different 'ridiculous' drinks. (1/2 off during HH!)  We each had the 'sour' and the spiked chai.  So good.  I ordered the fish tacos and my son had the burger but we went half and half.  It was one of the most balanced, well-flavored burgers I've ever had.  Yes, it was ridiculous.  I was so happy.  The fries were spectacularly good.  There is no comparison in my humble opinion.  The sauces were equally good so try them all.  This is the perfect place to go when you're looking for elevated food in a super relaxed atmosphere.  Finish dinner and stroll down the street for some excellent, live jazz at The Nash.    What a great night in Phoenix!  This is the kind of place that makes venturing into a new city a really special experience.  So glad we visited and hope for the opportunity to try again.  Great job to the whole team!",

Unfortunately, looks are deceiving and I felt that the RoRo burger was pretty mediocre. The toppings on the burger don't seem to work well together despite sounding good on paper. I really couldn't taste the gruyere, the spicy Russian dressing, or the gastrique onion. The dominating flavor of the burger was the patty, which in this case was dry and under-seasoned. The bacon on top of the burger was my favorite part. English muffin buns were nice and soft with a slight chew.  Fries were cooked well, but the tajin seasoning was a bit too tart for me. I'd get these again if I came, but without the seasoning.  Service was prompt and food came out quickly. I'll probably be back to give their tacos a try next time I'm in the area.",

The on-tap old fashioned was delightful and easy to sip while the Paloma could get a person in trouble by being too drinkable.    Pork belly fried rice and Gyoza made their way to our table and were quickly devoured with chopsticks in hand.   I'll definitely be back; several more drinks and bites I need to experience!",

    "text": "This place caught me off guard - I've known The Dressing Room existed but never really realized they had a full kitchen and served food; I've always assumed it was just a bar/cafe. After deciding to check out their menu, I realized they offer a lot of amazingly appetizing dishes that take seem to take a simple yet adventurous approach. The two dishes we ordered are precisely what we were in the mood for, however it was tough not to order other shareables off the menu like the Chorizo Poutine or the Spiced Falafel Gyro. We placed our order and got to fully enjoy the Open-Kitchen design as we sat at the bar top in front of the cook's workspace, gazing on as we watched each step of our food preparation. We watched as the egg was cooked to perfection, and as mysterious, battered items were added to the fryer. Not too long later, our plates appeared upon us and all of it came together in two artistic masterpieces. The pad Thai salad included the most incredibly delicious fried shiitake mushrooms we've ever had - almost a nutty but clean flavor to them. The crunchy texture of the fried mushrooms complimented the soft, chilled noodles in the plate. And as for the Pork Fried Rice, if you're a texture eater, this dish hits so many marks. We let the undercooked egg ooze out over our rice and meld into the array of flavors present. A few dabs of sriracha on top sets just the right amount of spice to this plate and you can bet we finished every last bite. Final thoughts about this restaurant: the soundtrack was perfect for the vibe of this place; the intimacy with the staff was just right - they were there when needed, interactive, but not invasive; and the actual ambiance and decor seemed to perfectly vibe with the overall vision of what this restaurant is meant to exude. I cannot wait to get back here again and try other menu items. Well done guys!",

I can't wait to go back and try the shrimp (I'll be updating).  They clearly have hired professionals and service was excellent.   Here's the real killer. The place. I ate on the patio under a sizable tree with a KICKASS speaker hanging in it. The sound was spectacular and the music exceptional (playing the likes of The Smiths, Washed Out and a slew of chillaxing hip hop that's probably hipper than I). For me, music makes everything better and they are nailing it this department. AND the patio is situated in the back, it's ALMOST hidden making it feel like a little sanctuary. It's typically something you see in New Orleans or in the cool little indie neighborhoods in other towns. This is RoRo's first and boy is it welcome.  Big ups!",

It was perfectly portioned for sharing, but not too filling. Great service too! We were there during a shift change, and had amazing service from everyone. We will absolutely come back next time we are in Phoenix!",

We had a couple great cocktails, rosemary and sage Bourbon, and then a Moscow mule version they call The Donkey!  Both excellent.  I had read that the fries were a must, and they delivered.  Crunchy with a slight malt vinegar flavor. Not overwhelming, very good.  I had the Ro Ro Burger on one heck of an awesome English muffin. We also had the fish tacos, excellent... and beer battered shrimp with fries.  Shrimp was great but not something I'd go back for with so much other good stuff on the menu to try.   We also had stellar service from Michelle and were pleasantly surprised when Brian the Director of Concepts for the Dressing Room stopped by to say hi.  Only took a minute to figure out these guys are the real deal, succeeding at delivering a great experience with quality food! Well done Brian and team.   Note: Also found out they own the little coffee shop attached to the Dressing Room with some killer B'fast items. Not full service B'fast but enough selection to enjoy a variety of things.  Will definitely be back!",

I tend to be somewhat of a French fry snob, and these truly did NOT disappoint. The tacos had great flavor, and were filling enough, but not so much that we couldn't save room for dessert -- the churro ice cream sandwich! An ice cream sandwich made with churros and vanilla bean gelato! So delicious! Definitely a must-stop if you're in the Phoenix area.",

I stooped for lunch and had the Classic Burger (American Cheese, Tomato, Red Onion, Butter Lettuce, Mayo) served on a toasted English Muffin, It was perfect. As I set at the bar waiting for my order I could see them making some of their other dishes and the Breakfast Burrito looked Amazing, I think I'll try that next time. Phoenix is known for its good local food and this place is no exception, I highly recommend The Dressing Room!",

Decided to give this little place a try based on the Yelp reviews and the short but interesting-looking and reasonably-priced menu, and we were not steered wrong.  Went in about an hour before closing on a Sunday evening and decided to sit out in the patio to take advantage of the balmy 80o weather.  The server was attentive and helpful.  The BF had the shrimp & chips - the batter was light and crispy, the aioli was tangy, and the chips were well-done, just as the BF likes them.  I had the Cold Soba Salad; lots of interesting flavors which went well together, very refreshing.  I also allowed myself to be talked into adding a skewer of the Korean Yakitori - the meat was rich, tender, and flavorful.  The BF also enjoyed his Pineapple Ginger Beer Agua Fresca.  WE SHALL RETURN!!!",

I had the all day burrito and my mom had the RoRo burger which was made on an English muffin. We split them so we could try each. Both were amazing and I would order again. We had some French fries so I asked for dipping sauce and they had three house made sauces they make there. This is what really sold me on the place. They got great sauce. My personal fav for French fries was the malted aioli, but there was an avocado creme was also amazing on the burrito! The third sauce was a Russian something or other and it was also a tasty option. The guys who run the place are all super cool, I'm glad they decided to open this place. The atmosphere is super modern and big city feel. Very into it, will return!",

I picked off a few fries from my friends' plates too and they were fantastic too. Unfortunately, after eating half the burrito, I noticed my lips becoming slightly swollen (I have a peanut allergy), and I immediately notified the waitress. Shortly after, the chef (I assume, perhaps the manager) came out and apologized. He was so kind and accommodating. He offered to get me something else so I ordered the TJ Tacos which were also very good. Perfect portion size and fresh. At the end of it all they took care of the entire meal, which was very, VERY kind of them. I appreciated their accommodations and sincerity in apologizing, although I do not put any blame on them for the minor allergic reaction I had. Definitely recommend this spot. Good atmosphere is a plus too. Very kind staff made the experience a positive one for me, despite me having a slight reaction.",

The space is attached to Be Coffee and the monOrchid and it is quite obvious this is a vision that they have been working on for some time. Troy and the rest of the gang at Conceptually Social really hit the nail on the head with their ambiance, lighting, energetic and enthusiastic staff, and killer patio.  Awesome touch with a shipping container on the North end of the patio for storage and such was a great touch.  The food standouts to me thus far would be the TJ fish tacos and the RORO Burger.  Happy hour happens daily and does not end until 6!  If you like old school hip hop, one of the best patios Phoenix has to offer, tasty food, craft cocktails, and great service, go check out The Dressing Room!",

Burger was fantastic and light and has a unique twist to the bread which i loved.. It was really good. Friend had a salad which she loved ( hey Jill) ..  Giving it four stars simply because id love just a few more options.

Music is a bit loud making it difficult to talk with a friend or date. However, the playlist is good.  The food is pretty good and tasty. There isn't much on the menu but i believe it does fit the place. Simplicity. I've had a couple drinks and i believe the choice could be a bit more diverse but i can't say that for sure until i come back. Also, a date of mine ordered a Bloody Mary but they did not have what was needed at the time which stuck me as odd.

A gentleman (who I quickly figured was a manager) was seated at one of the tables - he looked up from his laptop, acknowledged me and offered me the table. Nice!   I was hungry for breakfast (at my usual 2pm) and was delighted to see an \"all-day burrito\" on the menu. My server was prompt, friendly and got my order in quickly after I was seated. However, while waiting...and waiting... it seemed \"a bit long for a burrito,\" I chuckled to myself, \"is it that it takes all day to get it, hence the name?!\" My chuckle was silenced though, when that burrito showed up and it was the mostly perfectly wrapped thing I've ever seen. Like a mid-day tenderbelly-bacon gift! Not only that, it tasted delicious - the other ingredients in it: scrambled eggs, American cheese, crispy hashbrowns, avocado, roasted corn, and pico de gallo. The fries were some of the best I've ever had as well. (Score points on that whipped avocado sour cream that is one of the choices of dip with the fries; you may also choose from malt aioli or spicy Russian.) The same manager who gave me the table popped back over to ask about my food and he commented out of the blue, \"yeah, we call it the 'all day burrito' since you can get it any time of day.\" Is he a mind-reader too!? Haha, it's as if he known that I secretly had doubted. Well, I would wait all-day for this thing anyway, so I guess it works out either way. The rest of the menu deserves further exploration at a time TBD!  I also like that The Dressing Room has a large outdoor seating area and that it shares space with the adjacent coffee shop.   Really nice visit I had - love the urban decor, open kitchen and the excellent food and service...I'll be back!",

The patio is gorgeous and they have a bunch of speakers hanging from the large tree in the center. They are always bumping good music.   My only complaint is the patio backs the alley and the dumpster so you get some pretty nasty smells wafting over. The smell is worth it for the RoRo burger, it seriously kicks delicious ass. It's on an english muffin with a thick slice of bacon... Yum. The servers are all super nice and friendly here as well.",

I didn't want to melt outside even though the weather was nice. Everyone was very friendly and we never felt ignored.   I had the all day burrito and a coworker had the soba salad. Both were delicious and my mouth watered as I saw other food coming from the kitchen. I am definitely excited to go back and try some of the other items on the menu. They serve Mexican coke and coke light here as well which made my meal even better.  I did also hear there was a good happy hour here, so definitely will check that out soon.   I was bummed I was too full to try the churro ice cream sandwich, but for sure next time. Great food, pretty fast, I definitely will be back.",

Fries were a little over seasoned but still pretty dang good. But...  The service was terrible. Everyone working seemed pissed cause the small quarters and they were way over staffed. The servers were grumpy, all of them. Snappy to each other about taking things out to tables and where orders have went.   The charming thing about this restaurant is the small quarters, so the servers need to remember that it is SMALL and to leave their attitudes at the door. The servers have a chance to really create an awesome experience and unfortunately, they really ruined mine. But that burger will definitely have me coming back for more!",

Great size for a group of friends after work or with your significant other.   Simplicity is key sometimes, and that is what the menu offers. A handful of options to satisfy different taste buds. Would you like shrimp and chips? Or maybe a all day breakfast burrito? Or simply go with a burger and fries in which they season the fries with Tajin! Brilliant idea!   We both enjoyed our choices and so will you. Give them a try and support the businesses in our wonderful Downtown Phoenix!",

It and the fries were awesome!  It came on an English muffin which was perfect!  It was dense enough to keep the burger together and added to the flavor make up of the burger. They have a daily special everyday, today was Korean fried rice with shrimp, that my friend got and it she said it also was really good!  There is not a ton of indoor seating but there is also patio seating which would be great in the winter time. Ahhhhh almost forgot...the staff was great and really prompt.

So, it's a little smallish in there - but the very friendly host engaged with us right away, and set up a table - we didn't have to wait more than about 2 minutes.  They were quick with the cocktails / beers, and our server was really friendly and professional.  She carded my two younger guests, which I liked!

    "text": "For those of you who've been to such valley staples as Welcome Diner, 32 Shea, or one of the numerous valley Dutch Bros Coffee stops, you know firsthand how great things can emanate from small spaces.  The kitchen might be small, the menu might be limited, but even small but mighty spaces like these can leave you with a great impression.  I invite you to add another space to that list.  Opened just a day before my first appearance here, the guys at Conceptually Social have added a second Roosevelt Row restaurant to their repertoire in the form of The Dressing Room.  A small but mighty restaurant concept bringing what they're calling \"elevated global street food\" to the masses.  Located right next door to Conceptually Social's first restaurant incarnation Be Coffee (a wildly popular Roosevelt Row hub inside the equally popular MonOrchid), The Dressing Room is a tiny interior space with seating for maybe 16 inside.  The kitchen up front doubles as the bar and today was manned by an impressively bearded California transplant named Parker and his staff.  There is also a patio out back with shaded seating for close to 30 (something I'm sure will get usage as the weather warms back up).  The building also opens up to the Be Coffee space for overflow interior seating if needed.  The menu, despite being less than extensive really does cover a wide culinary geography.  You'll find American, Mexican, Peruvian, Korean, and even Japanese items on the docket.  The drink menu has more of an American tilt, but nevertheless incorporates a number of international flavors where possible.  For my drink, I went with the Cold Weather going with the theme of this unusually cold day in the Phoenix area.  This one has a slightly Italian flare with some Aperol mixed in with Bourbon, Ginger Beer and a couple of fruit flavors.  For my first entree, I'm on Roosevelt Row so it must be the RoRo Burger.  Gruyere Cheese, Russian Dressing, Bacon, and caramelized onions with an english muffin substituting for a bun.  And the fries, interestingly, were doused not with salt but with tajin mexican seasoning.  Really excellent burger (particularly the Russian dressing) and I liked the different spin on the fries.  For dessert, there is currently just one menu item to choose from as I write this, but it will undoubtedly get the attention of anyone who reads it the first time around.  The Churro Ice Cream Sandy is a vanilla ice cream sandwich with little round churro disks on the top and bottom (and these literally have the taste and texture of True churros).  This thing was delicious, but a mess.  I would probably recommend cutting the sandwich with a knife and spooning up the goodness from there.  Or if you don't care about the mess, grab it with two hands and go nuts.  I doubt they'll judge.  Total cost for the drink, burger, dessert, tax and tip came to about $26.  Much like their sister restaurant Be Coffee, The Dressing Room's menu is reasonably priced and approachable.  The staff is laid back and the artwork on the walls is quintessentially Roosevelt Row.  The location is primed for the First Friday crowds that will undoubtedly flood in before long.  And their late night hours will be a big boost to the late night crowds that frequent this neighborhood.  So cheers to the folks at Conceptually Social.  Two restaurants, two big hits.  What small wonder will they come up with next?",

    "text": "Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to a coffee shop, eat at a restaurant and visit an art gallery, all at the same time?!  Well wonder no more with the Dressing Room!   Joined to the well reviewed Coffee + Food + Stuff that we had originally planned to visit for some brunch, The Dressing Room is open and light with a variety of breakfast and brunch items to choose from, as well as cocktails and other drink options for the lady (or pretty much anyone) who likes to leisure!  It's got a very cute outside patio, which was perfect for the mid-November day and the fact that we brought our pooch with us too.  Comfy seating, clean facilities and speakers dangling overhead from a tree that shades guests from the sun, The Dressing Room is an ideal spot to while away an hour or two and diminish the hunger that bound to appear after exploring part of the city.  Service was friendly and prompt and the food was great! My partner went for the breakfast burrito, which was full of ingredients and filled him up completely!  I went for the fish ceviche.. YUM!! This dish was presented wonderfully, filled with lots of colours, textures and flavours! The fish was seasoned well, the large beans were a subtle balance to the citrus-tasting salad and the saltiness and crunch from the maiz tostado balanced the softness from the sweet potato. For me, the salad was slightly over-dressed and the citrus a little too sour, but it didn't ruin the rest of the flavours.  We could've stayed out there for hours, if it hadn't been for a good few flies that liked to take refuge under the same tree and sniff the same food that we had assumed for ourselves.  Despite having to waft a few flies, we left The Dressing Room with satisfied stomachs and loved walking off our lunch while cluing ourselves up on local art at the gallery attached.",

Order your meal, I had a cappuccino and the breakfast burrito, for my lady the chicken Sammy - now for the juice of the review, the fries with the different dipping spread was whimsically delicious, an excellent starter course. The entrees honesty underwhelmed - since moving to the culinary melting pot that is the Phoenix metro area I have been on a quest for the most delicious breakfast burrito - the dressing room won't even make the top 10 list, it was dull and underwhelming, small by the standards of its peers. The chicken Sammy was a behemoth but again underwhelming as I have found most fried chicken sandwiches lack the necessary juice to propel them to the utmost top of my taste bud stratosphere.   We finished off with the churro and that is the saving grace of the dressing room, pictured it was a incredible flavor journey of immense proportions. Will come back to this cute establishment to try any number of their bevy of options!!",

Options from pad thai to snitzel and fish tacos, spiking our interest in more ways then just our original taco Tuesday search. The space was pretty cool with an outdoor seating area in the front as well as an adorable back patio. Drink, the Paloma was bomb with a splash of cinnamon and vanilla. For food we got the bulgagi gyoza, the lettuce cups and the fish tacos. Eveything was pretty tasty with the gyoza topping the charts for me, such a different flavor then any gyoza I've ever had and being a big fan of Korean beef - it did not disappoint! A cool and eclectic spin on some classics, in a great area of downtown Phoenix, and I would definitely recommend.",

The RoRo Burger on a bun was everything one would want from a burger, juicy, fresh, high quality meat, and cooked right. With salad and fries hitting the same notes of freshness and flavor, I was in heaven.   The vibe is just as hip and colorful as Roosevelt Row without any sacrifices made to the friendly wait staff.   The cozy indoor seating fits just a few peeps but the larger outdoor area carries the same chic and comfortable aesthetic.

The restaurant layout and design is unique. I enjoy the idea of restaurants sharing the same space with other food/entertainment venues. The Dressing Room is attached to a coffee shop and an art gallery. I look forward to checking out the coffee shop on my next visit as it was closed during the time of visit.   My wife and I ordered the RoRo burger (Gruyere Cheese, Gastrique Onion, Spicy Russian sauce, Butter Lettuce, Tenderbelly Bacon, on a Toasted English muffin) and the TJ tacos (Beer Battered White Fish, Cabbage, Pico De Gallo, Avocado Crema, on two Flour Tortillas). Both dishes were delicious and full of awesome flavors. I'd get either again!",

I came and apprehensive, the restaurant only had nine patrons. But it was 119 outside, I was famished. I walk straight up the bartender he looked me straight in the eye. What can I get you sir, I replied: refreshing, anything refreshing. He said water and this-- he handed me a bourbon concoction- a bourbon drink with rosemary. Absolute perfection.  He directed me towards the menu-- I was lost. He graciously invited me to the fried rice, the TJ tacos, or RORO burger. I scarfed down my choice, the RoRo, hungry for more however his presence was satisfactory enough. I asked his name, Adam, he whispered through his beard. I am I incredibly grateful. I cannot wait to return soon.",

It is directly connected to the MonOrchid Gallery and a little coffee shop which makes it kind of a unique and cool setup!  We opted to sit outside, they had an industrial fan and misters going, so even in the 90's it was quite nice!   We started with fries and avocado crema dipping sauce and spicy Russian dipping sauce! The fries were well seasoned by themselves and the sauces made them that much better!  I ordered the RoRo burger and hubs got the TJ fish tacos.   The burger was perfectly cooked, had the spicy Russian dressing and gruyere cheese...need I say more?! It was pretty tasty! It also came with fries so we were up to our elbows in delicious French fries!  The fish tacos came by 2's and were a great piece of fish topped with slaw, pico, and avocado crema- probably some of the best fish tacos in Phoenix.   The restaurant inside and outside are both very small, around 10 tables max for each...it's a cute quaint atmosphere- so keep this in mind when you pick where to sit.  We sat against the back patio outside which had a long bench running along one of the perimeters of the restaurant- it's situated next to an alley and can get decently busy, and with it starting to get dark outside, wasn't my favorite spot just because the people driving by tend to take the corners quickly.   Overall, we'll definitely be back for some grub, but will opt in for a table inside or under the shady tree next time!",

I got the RoRo burger and Pear Shaped cocktail. Happy hour is 11-6 PM daily so super good deal to get a drink. The pear shaped was tasty that I barely tasted the alcohol. I have low tolerance so definitely feeling the drink but it was delicious. The burger was served with English muffin but it was a good match with all the ingredients. It was a bit overcooked for me and greasy but overall tasty. I'm not a fan of the fries because of the seasoning and flavor was a bit tart.

It was one of those moments when you know you can trust 100% of this friend's culinary recommendations and will hit them up every time you're in town.   I bet the Dressing Room is far more gorgeous in the daylight. There was so much to explore, but it was relatively near closing time and thus fairly empty. We sat at the bar where all the chefs were hanging out. We chatted, ate, and drank in a merrily fashion.   All the cocktails sounded amazing, and I can't remember what I got, but it was memorably delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about them now. Even better were the fries. O.M.G. I've never tried better sauces. The spicy Russian was my favorite.  For my \"main course\" (though everything is a small plate) I got the All-Day Burrito. It was 11pm so how could I not be craving bacon, eggs, cheese, hash browns, avocado, corn, and pico de gallo in a tortilla?! It lived up to everything I hoped it would... and more with the sauce.  I'll definitely be back here next time, though I'm starting to realize there is an endless array of eateries and bars in Phoenix worth exploring. I'm grateful for good food & friendship, especially when those two things collide. What an evening to remember! Thanks, Dressing Room.",

For the first time in a long time I was not feeling Tacos. I wanted a burger. A juicy burger with some spice and some sort of mayo-ketchup sauce mix. Viktor suggested a place called The Dressing Room. I agreed and we walked on over. We opted to sit inside as we needed plugs to do a little work on some funnels. The staff was fast to come talk with us and give us menus. We were both starving. We both ordered the RoRo burger with frys. It was exactly what I wanted; a juicy burger, w/ sriracha mayo-ketchup sauce on an English muffin and salty seasoned fries. This was finished off with a cold iced tea as today AZ decided to skip spring and move to early summer. It hit the spot.",

The server was pleasant but he seemed to be too over excited about the food. We ordered the fries with avocado crema to dip the fries in. Both were very good. We also decided to try the pickles because server said they were amazing........not so. Tasted like butter chip pickles out of a jar. The pineapple non-alcoholic drink was not all that,tasted like watered down pineapple juice with too much ginger. I ordered the prime rib salad with peanut sauce. Again for the price there should have been more meat, it too was so-so. My husband had the fish tacos, that really smelled fishy, to me that's a sign of old fish. With some changes to these two dishes it could be \"amazing\" to try again, but I don't think we'll be returning. They are dog friendly if you sit out on patio....to me that's a plus!",

Food was very filling and tasty, I even got brought seconds of my shrimp free of charge purely out of kindness from the manager! The atmosphere was very pleasing and calm, simplistic yet elegant in design. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to get a drink after an afternoon at the museum. Also, the tajin dusted fries are amazing!!!!! Don't think twice just come!",

The inside dining room is small, with counter seating in addition to a few tables, but there are two patios, one of which is quite large.  Overall, the space is comfortable and appropriately artsy in its decor.  I was very impressed with the meal we had.  My son ordered the shrimp and chips, and I had the Korean yakitori.  The yakitori is served lettuce-wrap style with a fantastic miso slaw and peanut sauce. The grilled ribeye was cooked perfectly and was very tender! The two bundles were so generously filled that I gave up trying to use my hands and used a fork.  My son's beer-battered shrimp were crisp and not at all greasy, and the malt vinegar aioli was a delicious twist. Great for dipping the fries in.  To drink, I ordered a cocktail called the Snoop: Gin, Aperol, Fresh Grapefruit Juice, Lemon. It was dangerous! Light and refreshing and way too easy going down.   I consider our meal an excellent value--the dishes were less expensive than my cocktail. I can't wait  to return, although I'm going to have a hard time trying something new since I'm still thinking about that yakitori! Oh, and the service was quite good, too.",

The \"pickles\" tasted more like cucumber with a ton of salt than actual pickles. The house salad, which any restaurant should be able to absolutely nail, was also underwhelming.

Ratings show that they're great, but at first I was hesitant to try The Dressing Room out because of the # of items on the menu. Another burger and taco joint...ehhhhh.   But once I got there I understood that the menu was limited because they've perfected every dish. I mean, the French fries were so exquisitely seasoned and ever so crispy but melt-in-your-mouth-y.   I'm originally from South Florida where there is an abundance of yummy ceviche spots. It's been a mission to find good ceviche in The Valley. But this ceviche, this ceviche right here...the best I've came across in AZ and at that it was a \"salad\".  The ceviche salad included a good portion of the fish, unlike other places where you feel as if you're swimming with your fork hoping to come across a bite of seafood.   Happy Hour is from 11-6 and all of their amazing cocktails are half off during those hours. Attentive waiters and a serene ambience. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "I've been to the dressing room several times to take advantage of their fabulous happy hour! They have half off all drinks... specialty cocktails included.... From 11-6 every day. That's awesome! I do wish they had some food specials, but the drink specials beat out all other happy hours in downtown. Speaking of drinks... their drinks are a little hit and miss... they tend to have very strong cocktails, but maybe not the most delicious cocktails. The space is small but super cute. The food I've tried has been great...the roro burger is insanely tasty and comes with interestingly seasoned fries (tajin I think...). It's a good sized portion for the price (around 10$). Their fried cheese tacos were also super tasty. They are full of different components that all add up to a well balanced dish. I'd highly recommend the dressing room if you're in the downtown area.  Ps- you guys need a brunch! Then you'd be perfect.",

I was slightly disappointed with my experience but the tastiness is the food really made up for it! Our service wasn't great though, we were seated and it took a decent amount of time to get water, and then a different person came by maybe 5-10 minutes after that to take our drink order. Another 10-15 minutes goes by and another couple is seated, served water and drink orders taken all in one visit. Next, they are served their drinks before us, then the server takes their food order. So of course, they get their food before us and actually finished up before ours came out. Super frustrating since we had been there much longer in the first place, and of course we're hungry lol! But once the food came it was sooo tasty I will probably visit despite the service. I like to give the benefit of the doubt, maybe short staffed that day or something.",

However it has a large outside patio with misters and great lighting at night. The music played was catchy, everyone seemed to enjoy it.   The menu is not large but has a great variety. I started with a bourbon drink with honey, orange and sage served over crushed ice.  It was refreshing and tasty, the sage was quite complementary to bourbon. They had several other crafted drinks and many craft beers on tap. My husband had a Mexican Coca Cola that was large & Ivey cold.  We shared a fried chicken sandwich, while the crust was slightly too brown, the chicken was moist and seasoned well.  It was served with a yummy tasty slightly but not overly creamy sweet dressing. It was really good. The fry were cooked perfectly and had a touch of lime and tajin on them, I'd never had them before but they were good.  The wait staff were friendly, concerned and timely. Definitely worth a visit!",

What's not to like!  We of course had to start with a lunch cocktail. Mine was a conventional Old Fashioned, but that South American Sour is really interesting, as was our appetizer, the chorizo poutine, because chorizo and because poutine. It's very definitely shareable, and if you don't want to fill up on it, it's a great dish to share for 3 or 4.  We followed those with tacos. Once you pick one up, I hope you aren't planning to use your \"taco hand\" for a while. One reason is that it's just bursting with ingredients, like the large shrimp or fried fish, and the other is that everything is just so messy good that you will want to finish it in one hand-hold.   Finding the bathroom as a first-timer is a humorous adventure as well. I'll leave it at that so that other first time visitors can experience it. You might need a trail of bread crumbs.  What a great start to my visit in Phoenix!",

The reviews led us here, and we immediately loved the location and concept. The place is TINY, but really, really cool. The bar and the kitchen are one and the same, with 3-4 people working crammed into the area, which is small but open air. You get to literally sit at the bar and watch your food being made 5 feet away.  We ordered the RoRo burger and the southern fried chicken sammy, both which came with fries. Absolutely heaven, both items. Truly, not a single complaint about the food. Huge compliments to the chef! We each had two drinks, wanting to try/share several things. We got the spiked chai, the Paloma, the Negroni, and an old fashioned. They were all strong and delicious!  Now to the service and our complaints. We literally sat at the bar in this tiny establishment. Took several minutes to be greeted and have our order taken by the bartender (though, I should note that the cook directly in front of us greeted us quickly and engaged us throughout the night. Again, compliments). Both of our waters were completely empty at one point, for several minutes. Our food arrived quickly, but was literally gone by the time our bartender checked on us. We didn't see or hear from her for over 20 minutes!   Reluctantly we ordered another drink, because my heart was really set on trying the spiked chai. We wanted the churro ice cream sandwich dessert but decided against it this visit. As she was making the chai, the shaker cup she was using actually flew off across the \"kitchen,\" spilling foamy chai everywhere, and she laughed and yelled something about power hour. We then watched her pour just the remainder of my drink and serve it to me. We had asked for our check when we ordered this round, and we were ready to just go. As we reviewed our check, we realized all 4 of our drinks had been rung in as the spiked chai, which at $11 was the most expensive drink we ordered. 2 of the 4 were only $9 drinks. C'mon now, that's shady! Again, we were totally over it by that point so we just left, but I know we should have complained.  During happy hour they have half price cocktails, so we will come back for that and that churro dessert, we will just hope for better service!",

    "text": "The Dressing Room has been on my list for an incredibly long time. And while I still have mixed feelings on the whole gentrification of Roosevelt Row, I do feel that there's plenty of respectful food options all packed into this little area.  The Dressing Room fits in just fine. Food-wise, I think as a neighborhood spot for local meetups, it works - especially those who are a sucker for sleeve tattoos, beards, and gluten allergies.   Our starter of guacamole and salsa roja came with tostadas instead of the usual chips. Guac was standard fare and salsa was excellent. The main dinner menu is short and simple, offering up a single burger, some taco options, all-day breakfast creations, and a few unique items to boot.  My girlfriend and I split a RoRo burger, which immediately got my attention from pictures due to the inclusion of what I still maintain is one of the most under-appreciated burger upgrades: The English Muffin. If you're unfamiliar, visit LGO or Diabo Burger to learn more.  As for the Dressing Room's take on it? I'd say it was just okay. The bun didn't really seem toasted, but more soggy than anything else. Burger ingredients were all decent, but without a killer muffin, the sandwich wasn't quite as memorable as I was hoping it would be. Their fries, included as a side, have some kind of chili seasoning on them which I felt kind of neutral about.  We also opted for the Korean pork belly fried rice. This may or may not be to your liking, but I appreciated this dish for its complex flavor and rather unique style.  For dessert, I really wanted to try their tres leches cake, but since every single person on Yelp seems to default to their churro sandwich and since I could find no pic examples of the cake, we went with their most popular choice. Sadly, I've experienced better versions of this dessert at other establishments. Their churros include sugar instead of cinnamon and had a texture that was very doughy - almost like it was undercooked. It tasted more like just eating fried dough with some ice cream and my girlfriend and I didn't finish it (which rarely happens).  If you're not familiar with this area, parking will be a nightmare. Please note that there's a free lot for customers on 2nd Street and Roosevelt. Look for the mural of the birds. It'll save you a lot of cursing and confusion.  Ultimately, I think this is definitely a place worth checking out if you haven't been. Based on reviews, the Dressing Room has its fair share of fans. And although I can't say that we were blown away by every single thing we tasted, I can easily see where the appeal lies with many locals.  Recommended to check out!",

Prepare to have to wait occasionally as it can get extremely busy. The food is good, but not great and a little on the pricey side. We had the tostada and ceviche, fries and the fish tacos.   Overall, I would definitely be back. The Dressing Room is a Phoenix staple and you would not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Wow. Simply wow.  I would have to say that the Dressing Room was one of my favorite places in Phoenix. It's located on Roosevelt near some very cool graffiti art so I highly recommend eating here either before or after you explore this artistic area.  When we got there we were greeted by I think the Manager. All the other waiters were pretty nice as well. Always is nice when you have friendly workers. The weather was about as warm as the vine here so we decided to sit outside. Once we figured out our seating arrangement, our waiter let us know about Happy Hour and I was pumped.  We ordered so much stuff on the menu and everything was delicious. The Pork Belly Fried Rice was addicting. The Bulgogi Gyoza had me wanting more Fried Rice. The Roro Burger was Juicy. The Fries with the sauces were super good. Seriously everything here is good. What makes Dressing Room also so amazing is the affordable prices with the diversity of the menu. If I do come back to Arizona, I'll definitely be trying to plan a trip back to the Dressing Room!!",

I started with a  Paloma. Often, I find them too sweet, but this one was absolutely perfect. I had a really hard time deciding what to order because so much sounded so good but unfortunately I only have one stomach. I love breakfast burritos and decided to give it a shot. It was the best one I've had in Phoenix. They put corn and avocado in it and it was amazing. The best part was the churro ice cream sandwich. It was probably one of the best desserts I have had. I need to go back soon and try some more items. Our server was super helpful and attentive. If you are in the area this place is a must try!",

Both are making my mouth water as I think about them. Broken down, the be sammy was an egg and cheese, but the buttery onion roll it came out on was unique.   The menu as a whole didn't come from a single country's cuisine and is interesting to choose from. The servers were relaxed and kind and the warehouse interior made it perfect place to catch up with friends. There is an adjoining gallery to The Dressing Room as well as an cool past to the building which you can read about on the website.",

We were immediately seated on the outdoor patio.   Based on yelp reviews, we each ordered the RoRo Burger and substituted the English muffin for a brioche bun. We also each got fries as a side. Our food did take a while to arrive, maybe 30 minutes, however our attentive waiter brought us some complimentary chips and black bean salsa to snack on while we waited for our meals. It was delicious and made us look forward to our meal.  The RoRo burger is BY FAR THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER EATEN. The burger was flavorful, the onions added a crunch that complimented the complex textures of the burger and the aioli added a slightly salty flavor to the burger. I loved everything about it. The fries were also pretty good as well - crispy, salty and had me reaching for more. I ended up eating my husband's fries too.   The exceptional service and phenomenal food exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back.",

Then... the dessert.  churro ice cream sandwich... was like last meal on earth worthy.  Oh, and to top it off the service was first rate, water glasses always full.  Bottom line... this is a class act, worthy of frequent visits and bringing friends. So glad we found this place!!",

Had Peppered Flower & both bourbon cocktails. Loved all of them. Generous size drinks & quite a bargain at their long happy hour. Make sure you get the churro ice cream sandwich for desert. Yum!

For 9 dollars I was expecting a bit more than 5 small shrimp, let alone on a plastic diner plate. Wish they had the traditional fish n ships w a twist , something worth the buck and not on a plastic basket plate w parchment.  Girlfriends burrito; not impressed at all, unfortunately. 8 dollars for a small burrito with cheese that was clearly the Kraft processed individually wrapped slices of cheese. They had large kernels of corn in the burrito that were a little funky. If they did away w the corn maybe they'd have a little more for better cheese.  At the end the owner kindly stopped by and asked about the meal, we let him know we weren't too satisfied. He listened to our feedback and had us try an excellent churro ice cream sandwich, which was again served on a plastic basket.  It's a beautiful corner, beautiful space, just doesn't seem as much effort was given to to production to the food rather the ambiance.  Will return again in hopes ownership sees this and makes adjustments.",

Neighborhood is funky, artsy and still a bit transitional. It's not a large place so we almost missed it. We were sat in the backyard under a large tree. Even at 2 pm there was still a steady crowd. We had the breakfast burrito, the shrimp and chips and the ah-maz-ing Churro Ice Cream Sandwich. The french fries were spectacular and seasoned with a variety of spices and just a hint of lemon juice. I would have never thought of putting lemon juice on french fries, but I loved it! But the standout was definitely the churro ice cream sandwich. Crunchy, cinnamon-y and lightly fried halves were filled with a homemade vanilla bean ice cream that gave just the right amount of sweetness. A total mess to eat, but worth every napkin. Would definitely stop back whenever in town.",

They were perfectly cooked as ordered (medium rare). The fries were tasty as was our side of pickles.  And the churro ice cream sandwich was worth licking the bowl (but I resisted the urge; barely).  If I could give 4.5 stars I would because the service wasn't quite perfect. Our waitress could have been a little quicker with refills and seemed tired or sore.

    "text": "This is a nice little cafe style restaurant with a limited, but good menu. Prices are reasonable and everyone exudes a positive vibe, from the moment you enter the restaurant. We were greeted at the door by several employees and promptly seated with our choice of inside or outside seating (we chose outside). The waitress Kat was very amicable and recommended the Korean Yakitori. Its basically two strips of marinated beef seasoned w sesame seed oil / and sprinkled on top w sesame seeds. The beef is on top of a taco like lettuce wrap, w the insides comprised of a slaw like salad. Lots of greens... the only thing it needed was Saracha  Sauce to make it spicy ( my recommendation).  This item was flavorful and after eating, did not leave there feeling like i ate a gut bomb.  The only negative, is no public parking, and can be an issue if it gets full. Overall I would rate the place as a solid 4 stars, staff and service an easy 5 stars. Overall 4.5 stars.  Thx",

Interesting guy and very Charming with a great story about the group's concept. The restaurant itself is in an old Warehouse with a funky art gallery and coffee shop and some other miscellaneous shops. Great concept and very interesting. Definitely lots to look at. I highly recommend this if you're downtown.",

The French fries were super good, they were seasoned with something I can't place, but as a whole, the meal was great.  The churro ice cream sammich - yas gawd!  Was a great ending to my lunch.  The staff is super nice, but disappeared a lot. And it wasn't one person who took our order, or gave us our check, or took our money. That was the only bummer I experienced.",

Now just because the menu is simple that doesn't mean the food is simple. Think of the food as  gourmet street food, small bites but with a twist.  I had the shrimp and chips (a play on fish and chips) the jumbo shrimp battered perfectly with seasoned fries and comes with an aioli (I asked for extra). My friends got the burger which was made with an English muffin as the bun. They didn't think they would like it but they loved it. My other buddy had the all day burrito which was also delicious!  They drinks here also come with a twist as well. I ordered the donkey which was a variation of a Moscow mule. It's an open kitchen with 4 table tops and 5 bar seats.

The fries were some of my favorite fries I've ever had- they had the perfect seasoning and amount of crisp.  We also ordered the special- chorizo poutine which was also epic. Lastly we ordered the ice cream churro Sandwich- which is now one of my favorite desserts in the valley. Also the atmosphere is very clean and trendy. The staff are extremely nice as well and very attentive and sweet! They also allow dogs on the outdoor patio that has misters! Unfortunately we did not bring our dogs this time, but we will be back soon!! Can't wait!!!",

I love the ambience. Since I  just dropped in dressed in work clothing I don't feel up to posing for neat shots. You can guarantee I will be getting dressed to come back. Now, and this is the sad part!!! The food is outta this world with a simple menu but high quality so it's not hard to choose quickly & you can't go wrong!!! There's something for meat eaters & vegetarians in case you happen to be travelling in mixed company. Atmosphere is the bomb-diggity, Music is off the charts & Brendan...customer service is on 10. I truly felt as if I was among familiar people. This was my first time but it won't be my last. If you haven't been - we've got to fix that problem.",

We were looking to get off the resort and go to a unique cool local joint as I love supporting the local businesses.  Well, Yelpers you did not disappoint!!!  Here is what I can add to the previous reviews...and I met the owner while I was here...this place has only been open since January 2017 and the main issue they had (space) has been resolved. Hang out at the bar and watch the chefs do their manic, sit outside or find a quite space in the attached coffee shop or art gallery.   The happy hour deal is UNREAL... 1/2 price for all drinks for 7 hours...how can you go wrong???  Not to mention their normal prices won't gauge you once happy hour ends. The food menu is limited BUT it is delicious. We were greeted by Amanda as soon as we walked in and we were watched over by all other servers as well.  We had the fries as an appetizer and Tostitos and home made salsa and they were yummy (ask for a side of their house sauce as well.)  I'm a craft beer kinda guy so I loved that their was no bud light or coors light kind of beers available.  We then ordered their all day burrito and it was yummy as well.  I stuck with the craft beer selections and my wife tried their wine and a few of their mixed drinks and they were all delicious.   This place markets itself as a glorified food truck on steroids and seating and they certainly accomplished that. If I am back in town, I will certainly visit it again.",

    "text": "OMG!  Came into Phoenix for my daughter's volleyball tournament. Was looking for a place to grab something to bring back to the room; saw this place and decided to try it. I got the special (don't know the name of it) but it is a Korean fried rice with shrimp, chilies and an egg on top. The flavors all work together to spice it up to just the right amount. The heat is just at the right level that should suit most people. Luckily this is our first night here because I will be a regular while I am here. The only negative I have is that we are from Los Angeles so when the craving for this dish hits me, it's going to be a long drive!  (But will be worth it)!",

    "text": "I walked into the resturant proper, made eye contact with who later turned out to be the manager on duty, but was never welcomed. Despite that it looked just like the pics on Yelp, I thought that I might have the wrong spot  or that the counter to order was elsewhere cause no one acknowledged me. When I walked thru to the coffee shop (which I realize used to be Songbird) the dude was super helpful. He acknowledged me with a \"Good Morning\" and \"welcome\" before asking me what I wanted. I told him it was my first time there since the change. He IMMEDIATELY BROKE down the concept: coffee, breakfast stuff over here, food truck-style yummies on the other side. Now mind you, NEITHEr space was full--they weren't even to 1/2 capacity. Regardless, it wasn't until AFTER walked back through to the resturant, placed my bag in the chair, and proceeded to sit that a shorter gentlemen with an auburn goatee said, \"So you'll be dinning with u?\" I thought it ironic given how he was the first person I made eye contact w/upon entering and subsequently watched direct staff. Perhaps the most frustrating and disappointing part of this experience was sitting at the bar, just 1 seat from the door, and watching how each person following me was greeted with excitement, welcomed, and encouraged to stay by the manager on duty, the bartender, and the cook--basically, the front of the house crew.   The food was good, and my server was on point--if the unconscious bias shown me by the front crew was the norm than my server broke the monotony. I can't say I'll speak bad about this place, but like Rotten Grapes and Joe's Diner, it will not be  a place volunteer my money.",

Despite the small quarters, it smelt amazing as we walked in, and I knew right away I wanted to try the RoRo burger. I watched the grill as the gruyere cheese melted onto my thick burger and was squished between two buttery toasted English muffin slices.  With ingredients like porkbelly bacon and pink Russian sauce, my first bite was a culmination of delicious flavors. But soon enough, sauce, grease and all types of toppings were falling onto my hand as the burger was too big for the bread, and fell apart quickly. In retrospect, it tasted somewhat like a glorified In and Out animal style burger with fancier beef, and to clarify, this is a compliment, not an insult!  Fries were included in the meal and they were over seasoned and a little undercooked; the yellow aioli dip had a tang to it that I could live without, but all of this could be overlooked because the customer service here was friendly and attentive, so much props to the staff! I wish I could've stuck around to have drinks and taste the burrito, but try the RoRo burger if you're in the area and use your fork and knife to eat it!",

The Avo Crema does deserve some accolades, it enhanced the fries, although the fries were great alone. The RoRoBurger was decent, wished they asked for my preference on how I wanted my burger cooked but it was okay.   Now, the cocktails were special, and happy hour runs until 6 PM and they are half-off. There are 4 beers on the menu, so, the drink menu is more oriented towards specialty cocktails. I enjoyed their version of a Moscow Mule, this was with grapefruit juice and The Snoop, which was gin based with an orange type liqueur. Both were refreshing, and complemented my dinner experience. I love this place is around, and if you're in need of parking, their parking lot is behind the park on Roosevelt on 2nd Street (NE corner).",

All these other things happened during my time there:  Dre Day by Dr Dre featuring Snoop Dogg played while I was drinking a delicious Peanut Butter Porter. What beauty. What grace. What serenity   Yakatori with Peanut Sauce massaged me into an enchanted stupor of warmth and love, while a plate of bright, uplifting Ceviche took its white fish and Peruvian corn and carried me to the Great Valley of Shrimp and Chips, where I was bathed it the velvety Vinegar Aioli and absolved of all my sins.   Get those three appetizers (Yakatori, Ceviche, and Shrimp). The Shrimp and Chips especially. Such muscular Shrimps were delivered to us. Think the Rock in Shrimp form. Delicious.   Fo sho yo tho, the RoRo is so whoa whoa. What a decadent and rich experience. Eating it felt being in an episode of MTV Cribs.  The service that was received was top notch; super attentive, super friendly. Being a person with not many friends, I am contemplating going back right now just to hang out.  Then, towards the end of the meal, love personified flew into my mouth and into my stomach, and the sheer centripetal force resulted in me combusting directly into and spreading throughout the very fabric of the universe, effectively achieving nirvana. This, my friends and countrymen, was the Churro Ice Cream. Singlehandedly, the best dessert I have ever had.  Dear God, JUST GO HERE ALREADY",

Food: The menu is a pretty short list but what's on it is done very well. Everyone raves about the RoRo burger but I thought I would review the cold soba salad. It was amazing, the soba was prepared well, and the soft boiled egg with avocado was a great addition. I added grilled shrimp.  For desert, I was offered the churro ice cream sandwich.

She is extremely accommodating and always made sure sure we were attended to. The manager Zach also checked in on us multiple times. The drinks he recommended were excellent! The best part was that they were half off. The happy hour deal was half off all drinks 11-6 every day which is amazing. The tacos were phenomenal as well. If you are looking for a quick lunch or dinner this is the place to go.",

The menu is kinda like upscale Mexican street food. To start, we had fries with avocado crema which was amazing! The fries are seasoned with a citrus salt, which really compliments the avocado crema.  For dinner, I had the ceviche salad. I would highly recommend it. The ingredients were fresh and delicious; it was a unique take on ceviche.   The prices were also reasonable, especially given the location. They do have a happy hour menu, we just didn't make it in time.",

We lucked out and got a table right away and even though we were inside, I enjoyed the indoor/outdoor feel since it was such a beautiful May night in the desert. I ordered the Roro burger with slaw. The slaw was light and tasty but the burger meat itself was very bland and overall very messy to eat. The Gruyere cheese and ketchup helped with the flavor to make up for the unseasoned meat. I tried the Pear Shaped cocktail and while I'm not usually a fan of pears, the drink was nice although felt very light on the vodka. I wanted to love this place but it missed the mark for me.",

    "text": "Met a friend here the other evening for happy hour, having never been here before.   I parked, saw a couple of gentlemen in the back courtyard and asked where The Dressing Room was.   I was told it was right there, and he was kind enough to escort me into the restaurant, which actually was from the back and into and through the kitchen.   I asked his name; Brian he stated, whom I later found out is a long-time friend of the owner, Troy, and is the general manager.   We entered into a conversation I found most enjoyable.   I guess I didn't have to tell him it was my first time there considering I didn't even know where I was.   He told me a bit about the history and the venue, which is actually called the monOrchid, and I thought it was most interesting as to how it all came to be.  I went inside the monOrchid and waited for my friend.   I had the feeling I had been there before, but just couldn't put my finger on why and when.   Then it dawned on me I had been there for Hakeem Khaaliq & Queen Muhammad Ali's showing of some of their photographic work last winter.    The walls are movable, and the venue can be set up as one large room or a number of smaller rooms.  They have special pricing on their drinks (half off) during happy hour but no special pricing on food.   No matter.   The food is so reasonably priced, it would be considered happy hour pricing anywhere else and even less so.  I decided to try the all day burrito with its scrambled eggs, American Cheese, Tenderbelly Bacon, Crispy Hash Browns, Avocado, Roasted Corn, Pico De Gallo, inside a Flour Tortilla.   I am glad to report there was not an over-abundance of potatoes.   Nothing worse!   The flavors were the right mix as well as the ingredients.   I love bacon and I love avocado.  The pico de gallo was on the side, which I asked for something a bit spicier to add.   AHHHH!  Heaven!  Perfect flavors.    Our server suggested we try the cerviche tostado appetizer, and my friend had the  Korean yakatori.  I liked my burrito the best.  I thought the yakatori was a bit salad like.   I couldn't wrap my head around it.   I thought yakatori was skewers.    Their parking lot is next to the small park on 2 St., or one can park along the edge of the street.  Troy is the owner and really friendly.   He came over and gave us more of a history of the building, and told us there are, in fact, offices on the second floor.  Amberly was our server.   Michele was in training.   Both were very informative, patient, professional, and friendly.     I would definitely return.   There is a plant shop, but, alas, it was closed by the time we got up to leave.",

I originally ended up here from yelping Be Coffee + Food + Stuff and, upon arriving, found out that these two businesses are housed in the same building. You can sit in either dining room and be served from both.  We happened to come during happy hour (11 AM-6 PM daily), so the spiked chai was half off ($4.50 instead of $9). It was good, and I could certainly taste the rum.  The bulgogi gyoza was fresh, hot, and delicious served with a side of kimchi cucumbers. The fried chicken Sammy seemed to be more breading than meat, unfortunately. However, the side of fries were good.  The EAT Sammy has fluffy scrambled eggs and melty Muenster cheese. Very tasty.",

They're seasoned but not excessively salty, always piping hot, you choose a sauce from three they offer, and the huge basket is only $3.   I get fries every time I'm here, which is often because it's right around the corner from where I live. I've had everything except the Peruvian ceviche at this point, and that's only because I'm not a fan of ceviche. My friend had it and said it was good. They have two burgers on the menu, both are good but I prefer the classic RoRo burger. They come on a warm English muffin. The fish tacos are good, as are the vegetarian (fried cheese) ones. For happy hour they have 1/2 price cocktails, I like rosemary & the sage, it's bourbon based. The yakatori was also very tasty, essentially I like the whole menu.   Since I'm such a fan of the fries I'd suggest getting a basket and splitting an entree with a friend, this makes for a nice dinner that isn't excessively filling.",

As the server told me, if we have the ingredients and not completely packed, we will certainly make whatever we can.   They have been more than accommodating when we brought in our toddler as well. With high chairs and a selection of kid friendly foods, this place is amazing, any time of the day.   Speaking of specific times, their happy hour menu can't be beat. How they stay in business with half priced cocktails is crazy to me. You can essentially drink the entire menu for less than $50, if you can tolerate it.   The RoRo burger needs mentioning too. It isn't the size of the burger that is remarkable, but the amount of flavor packed into such a small burger that makes it incredible. It isn't one of those massive two-hand burgers that drip down your arms but a smaller, cleaner, patty, set on an English muffin, that is probably one of my favorite in Phoenix. Fries on the side are a must as well.",

We also got an order of fries with all 3 dipping sauces which are DELICIOUS! One meal came out incorrect and they were very quick to fix it and Brian (the owner/manager) then insisted on treating us to dessert which was a churro ice cream sandwich. It was as tasty as it sounds! You can tell Brian and his staff care a lot about this restaurant and put a ton of love into it.

The burger is so juicy and seasoned really well so that it just totally makes your mouth water. The cheese is tasty but not too in your face and the dressing/sauce on it is perfect. The bacon was insanely bacon-y, super salty and crispy af - I'd recommend for meat lovers 100%. I am not a big meat guy (1-2x weekly) so it really hit the spot for me :)   The fries were also worth a trip. Seasoned so well and I got the avocado crema to go with and it was one of my favorite things ever. Also the lemonade was bomb as well!   Great spot and I will definitely be back. This burger is seriously everything!! Id recommend trying this spot to any and all burger lovers! It's a small space but perfect for a solo meal.

I ordered multiple dipping sauces for my fries, but none of them stood out and I didn't finish them.  My brother really liked the peanut sauce on his Yakitori steak and generally enjoyed the restaurant more than I did.  The waiter was unable to answer any of our questions about the menu. The manager came by and we had a nice conversation and he seemed really enthusiastic about the restaurant.",

And they sauces they serve with them are out of this world. My kids loved the shrimp tacos that had a few large shrimp on each one! Yummy! We will for sure be stopping in again! Maybe this time without kiddos for some drinks!               Ok... went are back and with the kids for a late lunch awesome relaxing time on the Patio. Just glad this place is in Phoenix and not tucson since I would be eating here way too much! Great place!",

I know some would look at the photo and think I am nuts.  You may think the salad looks too busy or too different, I would probably think the same but you would be sooooooo wrong. The cold soba salad is perfect in every way. I would eat the dish everyday day, no joke. The dish alone makes this restaurant five stars. I love it that much.   Okay, on to other dishes. The TJ tacos were a little disappointing. I have been searching and continue to search for the perfect fish taco. The burrito, sorry forgot the exact name, was very good and would order again.  Lastly, the staff was great. I have been here a few times now for the best salad ever and the wait staff have always treated my family and I great.   Overall, you can not go wrong with this restaurant and the best salad of al time :)",

    "text": "Great happy hour. Very good, simple menu  We tried both tacos, a burger, the soba salad, and the different sauces for the fries.   I continue to maintain that Heinz ketchup is the platonic ideal of a fry dipping sauce. But their house made sauces are good. Others may prefer them.  But -and this is generally speaking- for me it's like going to karaoke night and  trying to pull off Bohemian Rhapsody - yes, everyone knows it. Yes, you have every right to give it a shot and add your unique talents to it. But really, in all but the most exceedingly rare cases, we'd all be better off just playing the original and enjoying it together. Maybe you're one of the rare ones, but otherwise it's a long slog through disappointment and resentment.   The vegetarian tacos were the standout. Quite tasty.   Friendly staff, interesting space, good times all around.   Note- This review has been lingering in drafts for a year, so everything (or nothing) may have changed. Based on what we saw they are likely to still be rocking those veggie tacos, which is honestly a sentence I have never written in my life. Respect.",

The restaurant is not the easiest to find when your in a car and actually it's not really parking friendly either but I managed to find a parking spot nearby. The restaurant is small and has dining inside and on the patio.  There's a small open visible kitchen and attached coffee shop as well. Now for the food. I had the roro burger and it was incredible! It's the first burger I've ever had on an English muffin. The homemade thousand island was just as incredible. I washed this meal down with a glass of homemade lemonade!   So if your in downtown Phoenix and your looking for a place to get a nice healthy meal try the dressing room. You won't leave disappointed!",

    "text": "I love downtown Phoenix and was excited to try this place based off the reviews!  However, I have yet to learn my lesson... do not look at the menu online and get overly excited about a dish.  I cannot tell you how many times this happens to me!  In the case of The Dressing Room, the description of veggie tacos below had me at beer battered cheese!!! Yummmmmm!  VEGGIE TACOS(2) 7 Beer Battered Queso Oaxaca, Cabbage, Peruvian Corn, Pico De Gallo, Sweet Potato, Avocado Crema, Corn Tortilla  Why would you take this off the menu?!  It sounds amazing, but I'll actually never know... The better question is, why is this item, among many others, still showing up on your online menu in March when the server admitted that the menu actually changed in December?!?!  Come on...   Now, am I giving them 3 stars because of pure disappointment?  Not really.  I had the shrimp tacos, they were fine- nothing amazing.  My husband had the chorizo scramble that looked more like an omelet- not a very good one- than a scramble.  He's not quite the foodie that I am, and even he said it wasn't good... that's sadly saying a lot because the man is not picky.  Our friend had the falafel and fries which she liked.  We all loved the fries- seasoned with tajin.  I'm a tough crowd when it comes to falafel-but for the average bear eating at a non-middle eastern restaurant... you might like it. It was ok... although I would not order it myself.  The restaurant is super cute, great patios, great location... just wasn't overly impressed by the food...or the False online menu. Such a bummer!  Update to Troy:  Thank you, Troy! Your response makes me want to try it again!!! Thanks for owning it and overall just handling a not-so-stellar review with class!",

Loved it. Definitely a must have  Food- tried they Peruvian Ceviche and it was decent. A good portion. I just wish they would have either added some of the lemon juice the fish is cooked in either on the dish or on the side. The dish itself was very flavorful but I felt it was dry. I also had a side of French fried with the avocado may dip. Very flavorful  All in all definitely check out this place. I would come back next time I'm in town",

I got the roro burger and it could possibly be the best burger I've ever tasted. The fries were pretty great as well. The food is very reasonably priced. The service was great, the staff was personable without being personal. One thing that stood out to me was they all cared about performing the functions of their jobs with a high quality. The staff was very obsequious, which is what you expect when you go anywhere but you very rarely receive. I loved this place!",

Oh, the music was on point, too.   Super friendly and accommodating staff/bartender (as in not so much as an involuntary shudder nor flinch when we asked for our drinks made slightly differently). The craft cocktails are delicious and half off during happy hour. Also, BIG ICE CUBES. I ordered the cold soba salad which was flavorful fresh and healthy - an excellent post aerial yoga snack - the cocktails? Not so much, but HEY, live a little!   We sat outside on the patio on an unseasonably beautiful day overlooking this handsome, rusty shipping container kitchen. The unisex (multisex? gender neutral?) bathroom was sexy, too.

There has not been one thing that I have ordered that has been less than amazing. Roro Burger, Veggie tacos, Shrimp & chips, TJ tacos and ceviche. I love that the menu is small and limited because they really focus on the quality of the food and drinks. The staff is so gracious and friendly, everyone always has a smile on their face.

The fries are well seasoned with a pleasant kick and the avo creama, which is similar to ranch, is a perfect dipping sauce for the fries. We sat outside and they had the misters on to keep us cool. The wait staff is really kind and friendly. I was overall really impressed with the establishment and will def. be back to try their dessert menu out.

We had originally come for half off drinks and a bite to eat, but neither of us was really into the food items offered so we just got Rosemary & the Sage to sip on for a bit. It was a decent drink, pretty strong and flavorful. And for half off during happy hour, a very good deal. Just wish they had a better food menu.",

The classic burger, seasoned Tajin fries & veggie taco have been a culinary tour de force of what's being billed as elevated street food. Quick, affordable, and tasty... what else could one ask for?  I love this place. What a great new addition to Roosevelt Row!",

    "text": "Tried this place out yesterday while driving through Phoenix, we definitely were not disappointed! I was going to go with their Original burger but after reading some of the other reviews I decided to try the Roro burger and I am so glad I did. At first my group and I were worried the burger was going to be tiny after seeing they used an English muffin as the bread, but it was a good sized burger that came out. The purple onions they put in the burger gives it a bit of a sweet flavor but it's not overly sweet and goes really well with the burger. The burger comes with fries that are seasoned with something that reminded us of Tajin, which honestly I could have done without because it made the fries saltier than what I usually like but they were a nice level of crispiness so they were still pretty good. Our waitress was friendly and the place is really nice and clean, if this place was closer to home I would love to go back!",

The burgers and frys were excellent. Everyone that works there is so spot on with the perfect mix of helpfulness, hospitality, and attentiveness while leaving you alone just the right amount. A phx favorite for me after just one visit. Ready to go back and try the next thing!",

The fries have a really tasty seasoning and come with a few dipping sauces. Also, they have amazing cocktails! Everyday until 6 the drinks are 1/2 off!! Best deal ever! 4 dollar top-notch cocktails!!! Can't rave about this place enough! Also, everyone who works there is extremely nice!",
