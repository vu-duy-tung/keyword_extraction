Now when I have amazing food I judge all the same type of food to this high standard. The only bad thing is it disappoints you more often!   I ordered the cheese burger with bacon comes with all the usual toppings and a fresh baked bun about $8. The burger was tasty better than most restaurants. Was it amazing? No! We also ordered the truffle fries very tasty with chipotle ketchup. My daughter ordered the stout chocolate shake (no alcohol) very good shake. My wife ordered the turkey burger she liked it very much.  The atmosphere is nice and modern with a bar. Basically you get a table and order at the back counter and a server will bring your food...works well.  1)burger good  2)truffle fries amazing  3)atmosphere excellent",

I'd like to give them another shot.   Regardless, fries were pretty good though WAY over priced. Shakes are incredible here, actually worth the high price.

Staff too focused on being fancy and \"special\" instead getting the food right.  I had to repeat my order 4 times just to place it, and the burger still came out wrong.  I told the server that brought it out what was wrong twice.  It came back wrong again.  I had to repeat the correct order to a third person three more times and finally  the third burger was correct.  However by the time i got the correct burger, the fries they brought with the first burger were cold.  Was told they would discount my bill due to the mistakes, no discount given.  The waiter system is very odd as well.  Order at the front counter, food brought by a sort of waiter and you pay the waiter.  Just weird, do not like.",

Three burgers, two beers, two fries and one shake: $59. Without tip. Food was good but not sure worth the hefty price tag. Hamburgers are small for the price, too. Fries came out with two bites left of hamburger.  When noticed, waiter offered a shake that never arrived. To their defence, a manager later offered a $10 credit on the next visit , which was nice. I would have preferred better service for the cost. Also, you have to stand in line to order, somewhat like Chipotle. This took about 15 minutes. I would rather have sat for my order. Again, for the cost, I don't see the value.  I think 3 stars is generous. More like 2.5.",

    "text": "It was a lazy humpday and I've had a long day. I did not have any desire to cook so Mr. suggested we try this place out. Excellent idea, my love!   We walk up to the front and was immediately greeted by their staff. As he opens the door to welcome us in, he continues to inform us that it was their first day opened and that he hopes we'll enjoy the experience. He passes us to another greeter who greeted us and explained how the concept worked. She said that our table will be ready for us when we're finished ordering at the counter. The restaurant is well designed and staff is super friendly. The ordering method of this place, however, is very peculiar-something I've never experienced before. Luckily, we came before the crowd and was seated immediately.  Observing the restaurant and reading their service culture, the restaurant proclaims they use the freshest ingredients and grinds their meats in-house. They also bake their own breads and cut their own fries. Lovin' it already!  Onto our wonderful burgers: I had the El Diablo which had Angus beef, pepper jack cheese, caramelized onions, Habanero and Serrano peppers, and chipotle mayo. I also added an over-easy egg to top it off. This burger is one of the BEST burgers I've ever had. It was so fresh,so juicy, and oh so so spicy. There was a slight crunchiness from the lightly toasted bun and the meat was perfectly seasoned and precisely medium-rare. Mr ordered the Buffalo Bill which was made of Bison meat topped with an over-hard egg, Apple-Smoked bacon, their \"Sassy Sauce\", Frank's hot sauce, and Blue Cheese. Again, meat was super juicy and all the flavors worked so harmoniously well together. We also shared an order of their Parmesan truffled fries and Sunbrew Beer.   The waitress we had at our table was a little too friendly, almost to the point of awkwardness. I don't think she knew exactly what to expect from customers on their first day opened but nonetheless, we had a good time.   We will definitely be back and have already recommended this place to friends. Can't wait for the next round to try their amazing shakes!!",

    "text": "Remember about a little over a decade ago when you first tried Chipotle, and it was a little bizarre to order your burrito like a Subway sandwich? But it was so simple and since it was fast-food, you quickly got over it once you took a bite of that monstrously delicious burrito, and Chipotle quickly became just another quick service restaurant in your fast-food rolodex. Hopdoody takes a similar approach to reinventing the way people dine, but instead of enjoying the experience, I became overwhelmed and frustrated.  Hopdoddy is a gourmet burger bar. But it has a system that seems to work fine with moving its line along, but that goes opposite to what diners have grown to expect. My wife and I (and our baby) were meeting friends at the restaurant, and wanted sit ahead of them and give her a bottle before everyone arrived. We knew the place was pretty popular and called ahead asking if there was a wait. We were told the line was just a few minutes. Little did we know, that meant that the line to order food (which apparently you must do to get a table) was just a few minutes. So if we wanted a table that meant we'd have to order our food and probably get it before our friends even arrived. Either that, or we had to wait and watch the line grow while we waited for our friends. Lucky for us, they arrived just a few minutes after we did.  My next question for Hopdoddy is who the hell do I tip? You wait in line to order food. The bartender will serve you a beer as you pass the bar waiting to order food. There is a cashier that the register where you order food. There is a separate tab for each order. Oh, and there is a waiter working the table. So I guess if I order something from him, I tip him. If he just runs and buses the table for me, he gets screwed. Seriously, I must be too inept to dine here.  Oh, and after all that. I really wasn't overly impressed with my burger or fries. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't anything great.",

Previously, we had given them two stars because their food was great but their ordering system was abysmal.  The good news is: they've changed their ordering system.  The bad news is: they've made it worse.  Now instead of at least completing the transaction all in one fell swoop (ordering + paying), you have to order at one place and pay at another.  So, now the 20 minute ordering process becomes even longer as you have to wait for your bill, wait for the server to process it and bring it back, then wait to sign and total everything.  I can only assume this was done to try and increase the tips the wait staff was getting.  Well, I hope it's bringing in vastly larger tip amounts....because it's driving customers away.  We will not be back.  Ever.",

The Goodnight, has a great flavor, with sweet caramelized onions, fresh jalapenos, to kick it up a notch, with their secret sassy sauce.  The Terlingua is the preeminent chili cheese burger, with great tasting chile con carne, and  a few fritos to add another texture.  Probably my favorite so far has been the Primetime, with Texas japanese beef, truffle aioli, and caramelized onions.    The fries are great as well, whether you get the regular fries or the truffle fries.  Fresh cut and fried and well seasoned.    Don't miss the shakes either, I tried the Red Velvet shake, and there were chunks of cake throughout the shake.    The soda fountain is loaded with Maine Root soda.  They are far superior to what you get with a Pepsi or Coke product, plus they are all made with cane sugar.  I can't get enough of both the Root Beer and Cream Soda.  The ordering system is a bit different, but it allows quick service once you place your order.  It will get quicker as people get used to how it works.  Still not sure what to think of the tipping system.  The servers bring you your food, and refill your drinks, but it isn't full service, so not sure what a fair tip is.  People who say the food isn't that good don't know good food.  Everything is made fresh, expertly prepared, and served hot.",

    "text": "We had a great burger experience here!  I read other reviews and even though I was discouraged by the line, my husband wasn't and so we waited. We were encouraged by a passing waiter to sit at bar and was I glad we did!  (Although the line moved so quickly we didn't really get a jump ahead of any other orders.). I was excited to see so many local AZ beers on tap and hubby LOVED the fresh margarita with no premix.   I chose the black bean burger. The goat cheese was a good cheese, but I'm not that into \" really goaty\" quality, so next time I'll order pepper Jack and be thrilled. Hubby got the bison burger,hesitating because they're typically dry. This one was fabulous!    I love this concept. I get that it's not really kid friendly without a kids' menu, but that's not important to me. It turned into a spontaneous date night with hubby instead, without rug rats running around!",

I had the hail Caesar salad. It was amazing. It was definitely different than a traditional casear, with tomatoes, carrots, crunchy potatoe shoestrings and amazing crunchy chickpeas. Everyone was very friendly.  Only complaint was it took a little long to pay the bill, but since typically you pay at the counter, it's not a big deal. If bikini season wasn't so close, I would have loved to try the Nutella and pretzel milkshake.....they looked delicious!",

The experience starts in line where friendly staff greats you, answers any questions you may have so when you get to the counter you are ready to order, oh and they reserve a table so that when your done ordering seats are awaiting. They serve beer in giant frozen glass goblets and they do have a bar, but it seems to be more of a family atmosphere! I don't think I have had a better hamburger. Their BEEF comes from traditionally raised cows with no growth hormones and they apparently buy local when available ....and did I say it is super clean.  It is expensive, which I why I gave it 4 stars, but all in all for what you get its a great place.  It is a first come first serve, so keep your party small (4) or you will get separated.",

    "text": "Happen to pass this place yesterday while driving...So Glad I decided to have dinner there last night. The environment is modern and hip...family dinner, fun date, or hanging out. The food...DELISH! I had the Greek burger-lamb, feta cheese, arugala, (asked for caramelized onion), taziki sauce, and cucumber.  That burger was devine! Not sure if its bcuz I hadn't eaten food all day, or bcuz it was new...but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The margaritas (one the rocks) was so one point-no watered down drinks there. The wait staff/bussers/bartender were very inviting and patient.   Based on my initial visit; I would most definitely go again.  *constructive criticism* the order process is weird...there's no sign that tells you how the restaurant works. If it werent for the bartender telling us (we did look lost and confused-no hostess greeted us). U go thru a line to order-you pay-(they assign you a seat)-you find your seat-from there any additional items the waiter gets..but you have to pay again. The place was pretty busy but there was no long line. Its evident that long lines do form tho...there is crowd rope,a water dispenser and seating while you wait outside.   There should be a \"how it works\" poster or something posted so newbies aren't completely lost (like we were-and the two couples behind us).  I did order a bottled drink Kombucha(sp?)-It was terrible. The cashier did warn me it was a slightly carbonated \"hippy drink\"(her words). My goodness-it taste like vinegar and...earth.  My husband order the red velvet shake...he loves red velvet cake. His review-they just dumped some pieces of r.v.cake in the mix and a few cake chunks on top.",

We both ate exactly the same things: Basic cheeseburgers, Kale and Arugula salad, plain French fries.  My husband had a lemonade, and I had a small, dark beer.  About 2:00 A.M. on Sunday morning, my husband became very sick, and was awake all night long with intense vomiting and diarrhea, stomach cramps, continuous  headache, chills, claminess, fatigue and malaise.  This continued for four days, finally tapering off just yesterday.  My own bout of what I am guessing was some sort of food poisoning commenced at about 2:00 P.M. on Sunday afternoon with the same symptoms, and also lasted four days.  I am retired, but my husband was forced to miss work all week long.         I called Hopdoddy yesterday morning, and spoke with someone who identified himself as \"one of the managers.\"  I did not feel he was very responsive.  He said he or someone else would be contacting me by the end of the week;it is now 5:00 P.M. on Friday, and I have not heard from Hopdoddy.  I have called the Maricopa County Health Department to report the incident.",

Their fries are perfect- not too thin or too thick. They have sodas sweetened with real cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Although I'm super disappointed they took away the grass-fed beef option as that was one of the main reasons for my frequented visits, I will continue to eat here, just not as often. I would like to recommend to the management and owners of this establish that the current type of service system they are using is weird and confusing. You go up to a cashier to order, but do not pay until you eat your food. You have a server who may or may not show up more than once to your table. It's all weird. This is definitely the case so they can avoid paying full hourly wages and continue to allow the \"tipping\" system to pay their employees. Either make it a fully fast casual establishment or a full service restaurant but this half and half thing is a turn off. Like I said: good and consistent food but there are some things that should change to make this place more user friendly for its guests'.",

At first, I was thinking \"Uggghhh another burger joint!\" But, I was really taken by surprise by the atmosphere, customer service, and the amazing choices that is on their menu, WOOW! I had the primetime burger, husband had the buffalo bill burger, he had their amazing pumpkin cheesecake shake and we shared their parmesan fries.  My burger, I loved it. I love brie cheese so having it in my burger was a first time and yet, so tasty. I was also blown away how they had akaushi beef- yummmmm! Not, your regular burger joint! As I'm typing out this review I'm getting soo hungry wanting to come back to get some delicious burger again. :-) Okay, back to my review! I love love their parmesan fries with the truffle aioli sauce, it's probably one of the best fries I had in a long time or in Arizona!  The customer service was on point. Our waiter, which I didn't know we had our own waiter until later on. I thought the employees were just going around checking up on all of us. They were amazing!  We'll be back again now that my friends from Sacramento introduced us to this place. Lol",

    "text": "I went here for Father's Day with my parents and I was really excited they have a lot of interesting burgers on their menu.  I ended up getting a breakfast burger that had a fried egg, sausage patty, and hash browns and what not on it. We also got some frys for the table.  The frys were honestly the only thing any of us enjoyed. My burger was so greasy it was making me sick instantly I didn't even come close to finishing it.  As for my parents they're vegan and their burgers came out with non-vegan items on them so my mom politely asked the waitress if she could have a new one made.  The waitress took her plate and stormed off in a huff without even saying anything and it was talking a really long time so I went up to the counter to ask about it and the same waitress comes up to me and rudely asked, \"What do you want?\"  That really rubbed me the wrong way. And situations like that happened a few more times while we were there.  The food was mediocre and the service was terrible.",

We're from out of town and this place won't work.\"  I directed them up to Kierland or Scottsdale Quarter.  No worries, right?  So I walk in and the restaurant is busy but not slammed, not even close.  There are probably 6 or 7 empty tables and there is a line of about eight people.  So I wait 5 minutes and the line doesn't move. 10 minutes and the line is down to six people.  The cashier walks away.  So now there is a line of six people and no cashier and several other Hopdoddy employees just standing around.  Really?   I'm there 10 to 15 minutes and the line doesn't really move. The cashier looks like it's the first time he's seen a cash register and I now know why the two young ladies bailed on Hopdoddy.   I did too.    I could understand if they were slammed and if the other staff members showed any interest at all in helping the lone cashier (I kinda felt sorry for the kid; he seemed to be the only one working).  I could tell that had I stuck around and waited, I don't know how long in line, that this visit was going to be a cluster.   Why 2 stars?  Because in the past the food has been pretty good, although the last time I actually ate there the service was really pretty poor.  Will I go back?  Dunno.   They were great in the past but they are slipping..... for sure.",

The setup is a little different from other burger restaurants in that you wind your way through the line and pay before getting a table. When it's busy (weekends for sure), the wait can be a little long (30 mins max so far), but they will serve your drink as you wait and usually have water available as well. A good way to get your food fast is to sit at the bar. Of course this means an extra tip for the bartender, but totally worth it for the quick service.   I have tried the llano poblano, the el diablo, and the thunderbird (chicken) burgers. By far, my favorite was (surprisingly) the thunderbird. Best chicken burger I have ever had. The tastes and flavors are amazing. Just writing this review makes me crave another burger. One thing to note: if you order sparkling water from the bar, you will be charged and given bottled water; from the register it's free. Overall, a strong contender for my award for best burger & fries in Scottsdale.",

One server looked at my leg brace and crutches and told me to take a seat and my food/drink will be ordered sitting!! That is creating a great customer experience in my book!!  The ambience is hep-cat and cool w tunes from B Marley, Fleetwood Mac, etc washing over you.  Staff has genuine smiles and fab attitudes. They seem to \"want\" to be there working.

We came in at 2 o'clock and inquired with the hostess if there was a happy hour because it was our 1st visit and Sunday. She said oh yes it begins at 3:30, let me verify. She checked and told us it it starts at 3:30. We decided to run a few more errands and come back at 3:30. When we arrived at 3:30, we were informed that there is no happy hour on Sunday.  We ordered our burgers- all of us had the impossible burger with fries and an alcoholic beverage. The wait time for the burger and fries was not long,  less than 10 minutes. However when the burgers arrived they were  COLD and we all got a different proportion of fries. Upon touching the fries they too were cold. We asked the server if she could return with hot fries and equal proportions. She gave a smug look and attitude and started to walk away.  I asked her to come back and please take care of us, she did and brought them back within a few minutes but they were still cold and didn't say anything to us just dropped the tray and walked away. A few minutes later there was a man walking around the restaurant, we asked if he was the manager and he said no just a regular guy but how could he help. We explained to him that our fries were cold and our burgers were cold and he asked if he could help make it right by bringing us hot fries. Which he did and we were grateful. The experience for us was quite embarrassing since we had talked it up to our guest. Not sure we will return again....",

    "text": "PROS: Tasty food & drink, slightly swanky ambiance, decent prices for the quality/ambiance and pleasant staff.     CONS: Awkward ordering/seating/service system.   Here's some more detail, if that doesn't tell you everything you need to know.  FOOD/DRINKS: My husband and I split the caramel and sea salt milkshake, which was delicious  - creamy with really great caramel flavor accentuated by the salt.  It's not huge - a little smaller than a Solo cup - which was actually great for us but smaller than the average milkshake.  A nice big serving of tuna on the ahi sandwich - served raw in the middle and seared on each side.  The toppings really make it pop - lots of flavor from the terryaki sauce, honey wasabi and crunchy nori.    The la bandita burger has a great patty, and between the cheese, avocado and chipotle ketchup (we asked them to leave out the mayo and added their chipotle ketchup ourselves, instead), it really tastes great.  The whole wheat bun adds a sligth sweetness.  Note: sides are sold separately.  This suits me fine, but just FYI.  ATMOSPHERE: Very nice ambiance - a bit industrial with lots of blond wood and low lighting and no wall in front of the kitchen.  The booths are particularly awesome - comfy benches, high but with foot rests.  The beautiful bar has them, too.  ORDERING SYSTEM: You have to stand in a line (that isn't too efficient) to order your drinks(at the bar) and food(at the counter), while a hostess assigns you a table (but doesn't take you to it, just sticks your number on it).  She hands you a slip with your number, which you have to hand over when ordering.    Just in case the nice atmosphere has fooled you into thinking you're in a regular nice restaurant, just before the food counter, a sign reads, \"Woah, nelly!  EASY ON THE MODIFICATIONS, PLEASE\"  The did leave the mayo off both sandwiches for us without complaints, but I'm reluctant to try substituting the veggie patty for meat in their mny menu items the future.  Once you've ordered, you're funneled through a fountain drink/condiment station and let out in one corner of the restaurant.  You go find your table and your food and drinks are gradually delivered to you by pleasant people.    Another weird thing is that, at this point, a server comes over and says he'll be taking care of you.  My first thought is that I just stood in a long line and endured a rude sign to do my own ordering - am I now expected to tip this perfectly nice fellow for refilling my water?  CONCLUSION: We'll definitely be back, but it'll be in spite of the ordering system.  Also, we'd probably think twice about coming here with other couples because of the initial awkwardness.",

There employees never thought to ask the guy sitting by himself if it was his. After all that got my money back. No food. Wasn't offered anything not even the food. They honestly didn't care. The manager supposedly told the one waitress to ask me to which her reply was well I knew her wasn't number 22. Mind you when I gave the cashier my number I also showed it to her so there wouldn't be confusion.   I've been to the camelback location many times. Never seen a manager who simply didn't care about such a big mistake.   Don't go!!",

Yes, the quality of the meat makes a huge difference. The Primetime is sublime, and the regular hamburger is pretty darn good although it could use a little more lettuce and pickles. My third option was the Greek which was a little too rich for me, but still the flavor and quality was there.  The salads look good, but it's going to be hard to tear myself away from the prime directive.  Awesome truffle fries and one of the best Margarita's outside of Austin, TX which is no surprise as these guys are from Texas. Yeehaw, baby.  The ordering process when it's busy is a little laborious, but the service is excellent. I mean really great. Solicitous without too much hovering.  The burgers are on the pricey side if you are a In N Out fan, but if you want a great hamburger with high grade ingredients, then give Hopdoddy's a try.",

During the past three visits they've lost a burger once and twice misplaced our drink order. Something is amiss between the people who come to your table as 'waiters', the kitchen and the bar. During the past three visits the waiter has not touched food or drink orders and tonight challenged me when I asked to speak to a manager, 16 min after he said he was going to get our drinks. I hate to do low star reviews but it's sorely needed if this place is going to excel. I also think it's a mistake to not pay at the counter. This is fast casual. Pay at the table is a very thinly veiled way to extract more tips when the waiters don't actually provide added value. The actual kitchen servers do great. Please get the house in order so I can come in for a burger and relax instead of cringing that another issue will happen.",

Oh... let me not forget to mention if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth after all the delicious food go and order one of their milkshakes you won't be disappointed.  My favorite is the strawberry shortbread shake.  Everyone who works here is very friendly and helpful if you have any questions.  My only two little issues I have is that they have gotten rid of their shake of the month which was a great idea in my opinion and kind of fun and exciting.  My last little issue is I feel the food is a little pricy especially since you are not being waited on.  Overall, I feel Hopdoddy has some of the best food on Scottsdale Rd and is worth the visit if you are looking for a great place to relax with friends or family.",

All our burgers were delicious, nice flavors with fresh ingredients. The Ahi Burger had all the components of an Ahi sushi roll, bits of seaweed, wasabi and the ahi was seared a little too much, but still had the raw tuna in the middle of the patty. The Kennebec fries, which I asked the cashier what were they and he replied just a fancy word for french fries. But I did some research and that is the name of the potato which has less moisture than the average potato and is best used for chips or fries. I couldn't stop eating them. I had their Stout Chocolate shake to go which was placed in a 16 oz cup. Nothing special with the taste of the shake.",

It's a huge plus knowing you can go to a burger joint and get a quality, tasty burger along with great fries and a local beer. I usually go for the Llano Poblano burger. I think the big draw for me is the juicy meat paired with fun topping combinations. I would recommend skipping the turkey burgers here and going for the real meat. Topping off with one of their rich milkshakes does the job nicely. I suggest trying the sleeper nutella shake, it weirdly works well. Until next time Hopdod!",

    "text": "Absolutely, hands down my Favorite Burger Place.  I got invited about a year ago to try this place out for the first time. Its quite a drive from where I live now...(Chandler). Its about a 30 minute drive each way, but its worth it! I tend to come to this location more than the Phx location...as customer service here kicks ass!  Lets start off with how you order. You wait in line and order your food at the register, pay for your food. Then you get a table number and they bring it out to you. Not a ton of places do this style of ordering...but my favorite restaurants tend to, which is interesting. Its good for business of course, but also good to keep everyone happy and not waiting 45 minutes to get your food!  The line does tend to me be long on the weekends of course, but its for good reason. The burgers are amazing. My favorite would easily be the 'Buffalo Bill' burger. Its Bison, and has franks hot sauce on it. They have great fries with good green chili queso that you can order. The beer is fantastic, and is always SUPER ice cold with the glasses that they serve them in. Milkshakes are also very good here (nutella is the way to go).  Customer service is good here. There tends to be alot of younger people working here. I've had once or two awkward moments, but other than that everyone is nice here at this location. I've been twice this week already, which comes out to 2 hours of driving for Hopdoddy lol. I pray that one day they open up one in the Chandler (Germann/Dobson) area :)  Customer service 4/5 Cleanliness 5/5 Quality 5/5 Value 4/5  I'll be back very soon.",

To make my experience more enjoyable through the \"server\" that assigned our table number stumbled about the restaurant smacking on gum much the same way this establishments mascot would chew cud.   The only redeeming beacon for the evening was the food being palatable and not wasting the exorbitant amount of money they charge for a mediocre burger.   Overall I can't imagine myself coming back to this subpar mistake of a chain.  EDIT:  To add insult to injury their daiquiri tasted a lot more like rubbing alcohol and battery acid than the ingredients on the menu. I guess that's on par with the taste of the rest of their signature house sauces.",

Well we didn't get there in Austin so we decided to try it in Scottsdale. After all the hype in Austin, maybe we had our hopes set too high.  As many other people have said, the set-up of half service, half serve yourself is a little confusing. But now that we know the system, it's not that bad I guess. And our server was very friendly so there's that.  My guy and I both ordered the basic burger - me with cheese, him with cheese and bacon. We also got a large order of fries to share. The food came out pretty quick, which was great considering they were pretty busy and we were very hungry.   The fries were good but nothing all that special really. We tried the chipotle ketchup with them. Bad idea! Not a good combo at all. Maybe that is intended for one of their burgers? The burgers themselves were also good but nothing special. It wasn't bad but I've had better. I felt like it was a little short on both cheese and sauce. When I have to pay extra for cheese, I want cheese! I ended up adding mayo to the burger just to give it something. And maybe it's because his had onions, but my man's burger was a sloppy mess. With every bite the burger just poured onto his hands.  At the end we both walked away with the feeling that Hopdoddy was just okay. It's not that we wouldn't go back, it won't be a place we'll be rushing back to.",

    "text": "I finally made my way to Scottsdale to try this place. This mini chain started in Texas and now we have 2 locations here in the Valley. The \"Hop\" part of their name stands for beer (they serve artisan craft beers) and \"Doddy\" is a Scottish cow. Their beef comes from humanely raised cows that aren't given any hormones or antibiotics (according to their sign). They bake their own buns in house and cut their own potatoes for the fries. The restaurant itself is spacious and has a nice modern ambience to it. You basically order your food up front and they assign you a number and a table to sit at where someone waits on you. They have variety of special burger combinations to choose from topped with their own blend of \"sassy\" sauce. I ordered the Goodnight/Good Cause Burger (a dollar is donated to Lone Star Paralysis) - an Angus Beef patty topped with caramelized onions, jalapenos and BBQ sauce. The burger is hot off the grill and really good. They also have great shakes here. Some of their combinations include Caramel & Sea Salt, Red Velvet and Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel. From a price standpoint, they compare with Fives Guys and Shake Shack. I definitely put them above Shake Shack for the better burger at $8. If you come during social hour (3:30pm - 6), they knock $2 off the burger and the fries are $5. My only negatives is that our food came out separately and I really didn't see the need for servers when you order everything up front. They are basically there to refill your drinks. But overall I give this place a thumbs up and will stop in again another time.",

The ordering system is definitely not what you expect with the overall atmosphere of the restaurant but it works nicely as far as lunch rushes go. I've had the veggie burger and the continental club and the continental (turkey burger) is hands down one of the best sandwiches/burgers I've ever had. I'm not in love with their veggie burger by any means. Someday I might try the kale salad because it certainly intrigues me.  Haven't tried the milkshakes but they have specialty fountain sodas and pretty decent iced tea.  Truffle fries are a lot to take in...so I would go with the regular.  Lone review short: it's good but the ordering structure could potentially bother you. The food is good, but a tad expensive for a lunch burger. But it's definitely worth the experience is you are a burger aficionado.",

After looking confused the hostess hands us a menu and says we can order at the counter. After we order (you don't pay at the counter), you get your own drink and sit at the table number assigned to you. A server brings you your food and leaves and then the waiter comes by and brings you sauces. Why can't I get my own sauce? Had to wait about 5 mins after I got my food for the waiter to bring me mustard and ketchup.   Idk. Seems weird. Like too many cooks in the kitchen. (No pun intended). It's like they do this so you have to provide a tip to the server. Id rather order at the counter, pay at the counter, grab my food when my order is up and sit down. But I guess that's not what they want to do here. Likely won't be back.",

I had to go up to the counter to ask for them and was told all we're in the dishwasher, and were brought later. No one came by to ask if we wanted refills on our drinks, and I had to flag a server down to get a to-go box for my cold food. He was the one who took our order so I mentioned we didn't want onions but got them, he said he would mention it to the kitchen.

Or as my boyfriend said 'oh what i thought this place was called hop daddy this whole time'. Moving on from the name however this place does have AMAZING burgers (not hot dogs as one might naturally think by the name). Its definitely worth trying, yes they are expensive for a burger place but the meal is really worth every penny and this isn't just some ordinary burger joint.

We ordered a Greek burger and the Buffalo burger, regular fries and parm fries plus two drinks.....punch line it was $36.  The first two burgers that came out we're undercooked (we ordered our own temperature ) and had asked for no sauce on one but upon investigation I found assume under the one piece of lettuce which is not cool since I'm allergic. To the mustard in it.  Our server was very sweet and apologized and said she would make us two new ones. We  snacked on the fries while we waited 10 minutes for the new burgers. Side note, no visit from any manager yet to address this issue. While we waited a tray of dishes was dropped right by our table , coincidence ?? Second round of food came, no feta on the Greek and my side of fries from my plate had mysteriously disappeared from my plate.  Waiters came by to check on us and had to send her for fries and yes you guessed it still no manager got involved .  I love trying new places but this place is a one and done!!!!! I could have gone to Denny's, left full and had an extra $20 in my wallet",

    "text": "I felt strongly enough about my experience here to actually write a review. I work nearby and my co-workers and myself decided to come here for a Friday happy hour. Some of us arrived at 3:30pm and grabbed drinks at the bar while we waited for others to arrive. Including us there were less than 10 customers in the whole place. When more people arrived we wanted to move to a table. The employee we talked too was not accommodating and was very disrespectful. She said we had order first and pointed to where we would line up to order food. We told her that we were gonna have drinks first and get food later, it was only 3:30. She insisted we couldn't get seated at a table until we ordered. She then said we couldn't be seated until our whole party was present. I then mentioned that maybe we should go across the street to Macayos and we could get a table there! To which the employee said, \" you certainly can but their burgers aren't as good.\" We all had full drinks and finally got a table and decided to stay. We still had to go to the bar to order drinks, where I was charged $1 FOR THE ICE in my drink!!!!  The food was good but nothing special and didn't come with a side. The entire service model is inefficient and breeds poor customer service. At one time I counted 8 employees standing by the back counter talking for an extensive period of time while there was maybe 12 customers in the place and we could have used a server to get us some drinks. I was more appalled later when the place was packed and a line waiting outside and there were 3 male employees outside just chatting with the \"burger bouncer\" while there is a line of customers that I'm sure could be served or assisted in some way.   My expectations of my employees in the service industry is much higher, I wish I could remember the name of the female employee that was so disrespectful and unprofessional. If you like even half-assed service don't bother coming here.",

    "text": "I gave two stars because the experience is fundamentally flawed. The food was pretty good, though, maybe a 3.   First, we lined up outside. It felt a little bit like waiting for a ride at the state fair. You really had no idea what was happening, how seating worked, etc, until you got closer.  They had a waitress taking bar orders in line, which frankly is the only reason I stayed at that point. However, you had to close your tab at the time of service.  Once you get in to the counter to order, still not clear on what is going on, you've paid one bill (for the drinks) and are now carrying a massive goblet of beer. You order, are told what # booth you've been granted, and pay again. If you want water, you are given a cup at that time. So, now you've paid twice and are walking around with two beverages in your hand looking for your booth number.  The food came out pretty quickly. Unfortunately, requesting another beverage now means yet another bill I have to pay.  Honestly, I really wanted this place to work. I like the look and the vibe it has. But please, get a proper hostess and seat people normally. Let the waitstaff you've already hired take orders from the table. Get rid of the whole line thing. It's unnecessary and kind of a pain. It's way too much work for a semi-decent burger and a beer or two.  The menu is admittedly very limited. You can have some variation of a burger, a salad, fries, and a drink. Don't expect much else. It's like going to 5 Guy's with a bar and a trendy atmosphere. The waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. I know they all were, because literally every one of them waited on us at some point. That alone was confusing as well. I never knew who to flag down when I wanted another beer.  Once all of this is fixed, I'll be back to see if I like the food a second time, but not before.",

After having had one of the patties I'm guessing the seasoning is what is spanked into them. We had la bandita black bean burgers. Phenomenal. The best I've ever had. I'd eat the corn studded red-colored patty solo and enjoy it but if you really want an overload on amazingly paired flavors just order it as listed on the menu and you'll get bursts of slightly bitter arugula, refreshing cilantro, a bold chipotle mayo, creamy avocado, and a jolt of goat cheese. The truffle fries and margs were super accompaniments. Haylee, our waitress, was delightful. Her upbeat spirit and outgoing personality provided an uplifting and energetic dining experience. She is knowledgeable of the menu, made fantastic recommendations, and went the extra mile to make sure our party had the best experience. Our party of four all rate Haylee and the food highly.

They also will bring you burgers that are still look medium, especially when you clearly point out to them that you want \"no pink\" when ordering.

The staff was 10000% nice and very helpful. Sadly, I just really didn't like the burger. It tasted like an at home burger, heavy on the pepper taste, and just not what I was looking for. The fries were really good though, as was the made from scratch bun. Finally, the shake was trying to be too much. I had them make me just chocolate, no stout. It tasted heavy on something, like cinnamon. This place is great, probably for someone who likes more interesting tastes (my boyfriend LOVED his poblano burger), but not someone like me who just likes a straight up delicious classic cheeseburger, fries and shake. The hunt for a replacement continues.   The only other thing to mention is that it took about 40 minutes from line to table - hopefully that is just because it is popular as it just opened.",

    "text": "Veggie burger is for sure one of the best I've had, delish avocados and smeared with a cilantro sauce that was out of this world. As non-meat eater I definitely appreciate a home made veggie burger vice defrosted garden burger.  Hubs said his classic burger was very good but not unlike others he has had at burger focused restaurants.  To drink I went with the Caramel Sea Salt milkshake after 4 separate employees recommended it to me. A milkshake is something I order maybe one or two times a year and this one was so freaking good I can see myself packing on a few lbs just from wanting it again and again and again. Were talking rocks of sea salt in my mouth. Oh yes.   Fries were just right and spicy chipotle ketchup was a great accompaniment.  As for the line / corral nonsense, we arrived at 5PM for Saturday dinner so we really didn't wait, but by the time we left there were a good 30 people outside and at least 10 empty tables inside. I really had my doubts if Scottsdale peeps would line up at this place as I heard they do in TX .... Turns out they will but curious how long that will last. I can see your standard Scottsdale escalade driving frappucino drinking my-shit-don't-stink train wreck  group of guys trying to work the line here thinking they are all special and I don't think they will have much luck.   The \"excuse\" for the line is that you are waiting for a table to clear but it's pretty obvious they line you up to create an appearance of demand and exclusivity like a night club. You have to follow the rules like a good little sheep I mean customer or you won't get your delicious burger. Personally I find it annoying if tables are open I would rather wait at a table and chill with a drink vice lining up like cattle (Pun intended) but I have to give it to them it's a smart tactic and they are hustling you to buy a drink from the moment you walk up so they clearly have a lucrative setup. And considering I was balls deep in a $6 milkshake before I made it to the cashier to order their setup works. The only benefit is you don't have to play the game where some fat ass is saving a table for his friends who are still parking their cars and you are standing there like a schmuck with a tray of cold food waiting for a table to open.  I will definitely be back but if I see more then 10 people in that damn corral and can't snag a bar seat I will just go to smash burger.  I will try to stick to early dinners or lunch to avoid waiting needlessly. Time is clearly money here and I would prefer not to offer to much of either up if I can avoid it.  Everything was great and so was the service- based on the accents they must have brought TX employees in for the opening and I will be curious to see if local employees can keep the service levels as high.",

One other confusing part is that it wasn't clear who the waiter/waitress is, so we asked one of the people that stopped by the table to drop off stuff for an extra order of fries and it never arrived.  We had to flag someone down later and we didn't get it until we were done with the meal.  They were nice enough to take it off the check without asking, but I believe someone needs to fix this experience in general because when it came to tipping, I wasn't quite sure who I was tipping.",

Of course we had two orders of fries.  The bad news was our food was not hot when it was served.  I was starving so I ate mine.  We complained to Ulku who promptly offered new burgers and fries, but I had wolfed mine down and wasn't hungry anymore.  Ulku tried everything to make it better, offering free shakes, etc.  Ulku did refer our situation to the manager, Demetrie.  Demetrie came over to apologize and told us our meal was comped.  We didn't ask for this or anything free, but the staff knew how to take care of a bad situation.  We will be back because of the service.",

    "text": "OK, so if you love burgers and more so enjoy organic beef, Hopdoddy Burger Bar in Scottsdale is certainly the place to go.  First, let's talk about the restaurant setting itself.  The building is done nicely in a modern/industrial look with SW touches inside and out.  You are immediately greeted by a server who will issue you a ticket with a number for you table and then will mark it reserved while you stand in line to order your food and drink.  The line moves pretty quickly, but you have to wait until you are near the registers to read the menu board (if you do not have great eye sight like me). Since you will be passing along the back side of the bar, this is the time to check out what is on tap for beers.  Once you have ordered, you simply go to your table and wait for everything to be brought out (which the did quite quickly considering that place was nearly full).  We ordered a large side of fries that came first and was perfect for 2 to snack on (and quite tasty).  Then the burgers came and I was pleasantly surprised not only in how well they looked but also by how great they tasted.  Unlike many gourmet burger joints (including those that serve organic or grass fed beef), Hododdy does not smother the burger in sauces so you can not taste the meat.  Also it was cooked perfectly to a nice medium rare (seared outside so inside was nice and pink but warm), juicy but not to the point of being messy (meat also seemed quite lean) and tasted great.  Will certainly look to eat here more often since it is only a short distance from home ... and a good opportunity to try other local brews they have on tap (tried the house IPA which as pretty good).",

One thing I cannot help but fault them for, though, is the service and atmosphere. No, I do not want to stand in line with 30 other hungry patrons for 20 minutes just to order, then roam around with a number looking for a table. It's annoying and can become chaotic during really busy times. Yes, most of this can be avoided by simply sitting at the full-service bar, but good luck with that because you are competing with the rest of the restaurant over 15 bar seats.  Hopdoddy, your food is very well made. I just wish I could enjoy it and receive full service!",

Ordered the habanero and serrano laced El Diablo Burger and a side order of their delicious Green Chili Queso Fries. The burger was very fresh and tasty and those dang fries were mouth watering. That green chili sauce was so good that I could just drink it in a shake.  There are also several other meat group choices on the menu besides Beef. You can choose from Tuna, Bison, Lamb, Turkey, Chicken and a few others to make your tummy rumble. They even have some good looking Salads for those of you that are looking for some fiber.  Service was friendly and the inside was very comfortable. There is a large full bar in the middle of the eating area and they also have a nice patio area for those who love the outdoors.  Looking forward to coming back again and trying out some other items on their tasty menu. Might even twist my arm and go for one of those locally brewed craft beers.  Come on over and give them a shout out. I got lucky today and there was no wait for a table. This place could easily get crazy during peak eating hours. BURGER TIME!  4 Stars",

Yes since it is close to home and great quality.  Tried going there last Saturday and the line into the restaurant was out the door, so we decided to come back another day.   Wide selection of burgers including bison which I will try next time, had the Llano Poblano Burger with a fried egg which was prepared well and very juicy with truffle fries which were very good. The True test were my kids thought this was one of the better burgers that they have had.  Location is very accessible with plenty of parking and the ambiance is very nice, with of course a bar, very modern decor and tv monitors that add to the atmosphere but does not make it a sports bar. Plenty of outside seating for the current awesome night dining.  Service was good but the waiter really does not need to do anything as they have a self serve drink dispenser.  Will go back to try the other burgers and encourage anyone to try this new resatauant.",

Even if you aren't in to burgers per se they have, fish and plant based options as well.    I don't do soda, but it was refreshing to see drink options from companies other than Coke & Pepsi. Sort of fits in with their local / craft theme.  One complaint? No sweet potato fries. Sort of disappointing, but the fries they do have were good.",

My friends and I were looking for the perfect spot for food and booze, one because we were hungry and two, the weather outside made us crave cold and refreshing beers. Hopdoddy met all of our needs.   Order at the counter and a waitress will provide a table number for you. Present the number to the cashier and wait at your table for the food to arrive.   All of their burgers sound delicious and taste very fresh. My friends and I ordered the Magic Shroom Burger, El Diablo Burger and the Greek Burger. If you're looking for a nice kick, El Diablo is perfect for you. It comes with habaneros AND serrano chilis, so this is not for the faint of heart. The Greek is your typical Lamb Burger, which comes with feta, argula, tzatziki sauce and pickled red onions. My favorite burger, which unfortunately was not the burger I ordered, was the Magic Shroom burger. Something about mushrooms and pesto just always makes for the best bites.   Parmesan Truffle Fries are BOMBDIGGITY, and comes with a side of truffle aioli. It's a hefty portion too, perfect for a group to share.   Their signature sips seem to be a little on the sweeter side. I ordered the mighty mule and had to wait for it to be watered down until I felt comfortable drinking it. However, their craft beers and drafts were perfect and I highly recommend the HopDaddy IPA.",

    "text": "While I've visited the Camelback Hopdoddy location a dozen times in the last few years, this was my first experience at their Scottsdale spot. My girlfriend and I went on Veteran's Day, which was a total madhouse - especially in comparison to the Veteran's Day we visited the previous year at Camelback. I'm not entirely sure if it was so packed because of the Veteran's Day deal, or if people in Scottsdale just really, really like trendy burger bars. I'd imagine it's a combination of both.  The line was incredibly long, which I later learned was only worsened by the fact that they make you pay for your food at the counter. At Camelback, you only order at the counter. When you're finished, one of the \"severs\" gives you a bill - which is a far more efficient approach, in my opinion.  Anyway, I've always like Hopdoddy, even if I maintain my stance that they look like they're following a checklist of what it takes to appeal to the millennial crowd - right down to the slogans laced with sexual innuendos.   If you only eat fast food burgers, these things will blow your mind. However, if you've familiar with the whole upscale burger-bar trend that's a bit oversaturated in Phoenix, you'll find that Hopdoddy actually even holds its own quite well against those.   Every burger I've tried is consistent and has never left me disappointed. I'm a big fan of their Diablo, Buffalo Bill (sans the blue cheese), and just a straight-up classic with a fried egg modification. But really, it's all about personal preference. Are they the best? Not by a long shot. But for a multi-state operated chain, you can do much, much worse than Hopdoddy.  Their fries are just standard. They're good, but not particularly great. I once compared their garlic fries to what you'd get at Smashburger, which isn't really saying all that much. Nevertheless, they're still edible. I suggest if you're dining as a pair, just order a large and split them.  The shakes are all fine, but a bit uninspiring in terms of creations. I mean, it's not like you can't obtain similar quality shakes with the same ingredients at a dozen other places around here.  Despite my criticisms, I do feel that Hopdoddy does consistently deliver in terms of their burgers. And for that, I give them a strong recommendation - even though I prefer the setup and \"vibe\" at Camelback just a bit more.",

Last night my wife ordered a burger on a gluten free bun and asked for no mushrooms. 7 minutes after ordering someone came out from the kitchen to tell us they were out of gluten free buns. Life happens but would have been nice to know at time of the order. What ticked us off most is that they didn't even offer to refund the extra money we paid for the gluten free bun...oh, and the burger came out with mushrooms. Think this will be our last minute to this location. Too many misses over the years. The ATX based locations are so much better.",

I am a vegetarian who does not prefer meaty tasting substitutes so I didn't want the other option of the Incredible Burger. Perhaps I am picky, and being a vegetarian shouldn't be going to dinner at a burger place but this is not the first time they have been out of the burger of my choice. The other option available, besides sides, was a salad. It just seemed like a such a let down compared to this fantastic burger I was excited for. Normally I would chalk this up to bad timing but this was the third time I have faced this dilemma with this location. I am discouraged to go back, in fear of the let down.",

The greeter at the door assigned us a table when we entered, but you order at the front and they bring the food to you. Being a french fry fiend I wanted the truffle oil fries. Fries never fail me. He ended up getting the diablo, or whatever freakishly spicy burger it was. After that we took our seats and waited for the food to come out. Wait time was average. When my fries came out, I was surprised that it was served in a metal bowl used to prepare the food (or at least that is what I use it for at home). Taste was okay. It was the okayest tasting truffle oil fries I have ever tasted. But then again, maybe I'm used to a stronger truffle oil flavor to my fries. The servers were nice and the restaurant was clean. The cushiony black booths were very comfortable. Getting the food proved to be a little hectic though.",

The burger although flavorful was over cooked not an once of pink and I ordered it very pink came medium well. The truffle fries were well seasoned but severely under cooked, raw crunch potatoes The only plus was the root beer float  Sadly I did not take any photos as I was too hungry. I do not know if I will be back for a long while, as they are not consistent some times  it is good other times it is bad service It is sometimes good and often bad. There are many burger places in this town and spotty service and consistency issues are not ok  Granted some burger places are not so called gourmet yet the food is better than the gourmet which would you rather have a poor 12 dollar burger in a so called gourmet burger bar or a 9 dollar one in a nice casual spot that is consistent? Personally I would rather do the 9 dollar one the ambiance might not be as nice however I know my food will always be on point. For now my review stays at three stars maybe it will change but for now it will stay where it is at for my review the spotty ness is not good for customers that frequent this establishment, please get it together people for your sake not mine there are plenty of other places to go that have this food",

We had been to Hopdoddy's 1 previous time and were happy with our experience; however, yesterday I feel I would have enjoyed 5 guys a lot more than Hopdoddys.  We waited in a very slow moving line for 30 min. The cashier was distracted and asked us 3 times what we wanted.  When we finally sat down the server asked again what we had ordered.  Once our food arrived our fries were cold, my child's grilled cheese was just unmelted cheddar cheese between to grilled(on 1 side) hamburger buns.  My wife's burger only had sauce on 1 side, and my burger came out with the bacon sitting on the tray and not in the burger.  Both of our burgers were overcooked and tasted very bland. Once the waitress dropped off the food we did not see her again until she picked up the trays.  Very disappointing meal and we will not be going back as there are much better places for a burger in the valley.",

    "text": "Still on our quest to find a 'different' burger joint, my wife and I stopped by HopDaddy today to see what all the fuss was about. Maserati parked in the parking lot, no intimidation there. No valet parking. So far so good.  We're greeted as we walk in the door and they explain this bizarro ordering system to us. They asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar, a table or booth. We wanted a booth, so she wrote a number on the piece of paper, handed us some menu's and said we were welcome to take a seat (pointing in the direction of the booth that has a number flag on it) and to walk up to the cashier by the kitchen area when we were ready to place our order. Strange. Its like a Bistro, but not like a Bistro.  The have a large sign saying that they bake they own buns, grind their own meet, and hand cut the fries all on-premises. They even sell bags of 'yesterdays' buns, which still looked and felt very fresh.  Things get really wild when you're asked what you want to drink. Yes, the place is called HopDaddy, so beer would be an obvious choice, so wouldn't Coke or Pepsi also be obvious? No! Here they have a soda fountain that serves Maine Root branded soft drinks. Go on, Google Maine Root soft drinks. I've never heard of them, either. So how am I suppose to pick a drink when I've never tasted any of them before? This is just bad marketing. I'm all for offering customer alternatives, but at least have a Coke or Pepsi fountain machine alongside the alternative! I ended up getting a Mexican Coke, which they sell in glass bottles imported from Mexico (mexico still uses real sugar in their Coke, while Coke is the USA is made with High Fructose Corn Syrup) and they do not taste the same. Coke make with real sugar is much sweeter, like it used to be when I was a kid.  However, it just so happens that Maine Root offers something called \"Mexican Cola\" on the fountain machine. And something else called \"Doppleganger\" which I interpreted to mean 'coke-like.' Doppleganger tasted like RC and Mexican cola tasted like Mexican Coke or Pepsi. The Blueblerry tasted like a lightly flavored water. I didn't try the orange or lemon-lime. What's the point of offering an alternative soda fountain that has all the same flavors the big guys make? Why not offer REAL alternatives to flavors we've never tasted before??? Wouldn't that make more sense? Otherwise, it just appears you are too cheap to get the Coke or Pepsi fountain machine. It might as well have been called Bepsi. Seems more like a financial move on behalf of management, and not a real alternative to the everyday brainwashing we face from Coke and Pepsi dispensaries.  They serve burgers made from Bison, lamb, chicken, turkey and tuna! And a veggie burger as well (though it does have cheese on it.)  Prices are decent, burgers run from $6.50-$12. There is a fully stocked bar, with seats surrounding it, if that's your thing.  Once we ordered at the cashier, she took our little table ticket and gave us cups for our drinks (serve yourself) but everything is full service from here on out. Again, its a bit odd.  The Kennebec fries were delivered to our table almost immediately. They are served on a baking try with wax or parchment paper. Are they baked? No, they are fried. This is just how they are served! The fries are so crunchy, they remind me of potato stix, a snack you can pick up at any grocery store. They are thicker than potato stix, but they crunch and taste just like them. And they were not at all greasy. They decorate them with parsley, which I could do without. But they were very, very, very good! Definitely going to order those again! Regular Kennebec Fries sell for $2.75. That's a bargain!  When our burgers arrived, they were so salty as to almost be inedible. I ordered my burger plain and dry. All I wanted was the meat and bun. That's just what I got, but the salt! OMG! If they would have just left the angus alone, as nature made it, ground it and cooked it, I bet it would have been perfect. But, no, they thought they could do better than nature and completely ruined it. The burger was built loosely, and they offer to cook it medium or medium-well only. I asked for mine to be medium-well. The bun was fresh and delicious. My wife ordered the classic burger (same as me) but with everything on it except a bun, preferring a lettuce wrap instead. Again, far too salty.  Now, during this time, no less than 5 different employees visited our table and asked if everything was okay? If we needed any extra napkins or condiments or refills on our drinks. And we both said everything was fine because I didn't want to make a scene of sending food back for being too salty. Maybe it was a mistake by whoever prepped that night. Maybe we just went on a bad day.  The place is pretty cool, the employees are all very friendly, a fully stocked bar with beer and spirits and wine and the prices were very good for Scottsdale. Our total was $23.25 +$1.85 tax.",

So I sit at the bar for 10 more minutes. Finally a shake making person asked what I would like to drink i said a Pilsner, then she went back to making shakes. No beer and no order taken after 20 minutes of being there. I left and will never return. Good luck.",

Great healthier menu choices as well! Glad there's a hop doddy in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, I have to give only a 2 star review.  I have been a fairly regular customer since I found this restaurant several years ago.  At first the food quality was very good.  I am Celiac, so getting a gluten free bun is an imperative.  Hopdoddy has the best gluten free hamburger bun that I have had anywhere.  Most of the time, the burgers are good, but sometimes the chef just doesn't know how to cook them.  My most recent burger was ordered medium and the burger was rare on one side and well done on the other side of the same burger!  The truffle fries (and sweet potato fries) are outstanding...when you get a good batch.  You don't always get a good batch.  So, what kept me coming to Hopdoddy all these years?  It was the sodas.  Yes, I know they have some great beers on tap at Hopdoddy, but I have to be gluten free.  The pure cane sugar Maine Root sodas and especially the Doppelganger soda were outstanding...when the soda machine was working correctly (60-70% chance at this location).  Now, Hopdoddy has decided to dump these sodas for Stubborn (PepsiCo) sodas which are lower calorie using Sucralose and Stevia.  Eating a burger is an experience in gluttony to begin with, so if I choose to pair it with a superb beer or a pure cane sugar soda, that is my choice.  I don't want to pair it with a subpar diet soda (particularly one from PepsiCo...what happened to artisanal soda to go with artisanal burger?).  Very disappointed with Hopdoddy's decision to dump Maine Root sodas, especially since this was one of the only places to get Doppelganger in the Phoenix area.  Now, I have no reason to return to Hopdoddy...",

On my most recent trip I learned they no longer serve that option, but they do still have a grass-fed bison patty option.   As a burger bar, they definitely make delicious burgers. One of my favorite parts is the gluten-free bun you can get. Frankly, I'd like to gobble up that alone with a big schmear of butter if I could. It's like a biscuit almost.   Hopdoddy prides itself on using plenty of local ingredients which is great. The more local the better in my book.   I'd give the place five stars except the place is so dang noisy once tables start filling. I also think the process of standing in line to order and then going to sit seems out of place there. I like that at Chipotle and other places, but Hopdoddy seems like a place where we should be seated in a more traditional way.",

    "text": "Really yummy food! Magic shroom burger has a pesto mayo that adds an out of this world taste combo. I also had truffle fries and a doble fima margarita. Which were both soo good. All service was fast and friendly. This place is in the details: creative flavor combos, water with lemon and cucumbers if you're waiting outside, order drinks while you wait on line, big into local meat, recycling, fresh house made ingredients.., the list goes on. We shared a Carmel and sea salt shake after dinner.. Swoon! Delicious!  The only thing is.. After waiting in line to order.. For 30 minutes! And observing how it's ran: order at the counter, wait for number of table from hostess, wait for food, meet a server that is waiting on you but you are not sure why they didn't take your order... The structure is confusing!! I  am not confident even the awesome food will bring me back because I just don't want to wait in line that long cafeteria style to order. The place is packed with a dinner rush amount of employees - just do table service this would get 5 stars from me and others! The atmosphere and menu set it apart, but the confusing customer structure just sucks.",

    "text": "A++ Burger Joint!  Dropped by and the place was hoppin, pun intended. Several hosts at the door quickly recognized it was our first time by the somewhat confused look on our faces. They handed us menus, pointed out the large counter bar, and escorted us past it towards the back where you order your meal. You're given a table number and are challenged to find it. Don't worry, it's not too tough.  I ordered the Goodnight Burger and well, good night and get out, it was pretty darn amazing. I'll spell it out for you:  Angus Beef, Tillamook Cheddar, Hickory BBQ Sauce, Caramelized Onions Sliced Jalapenos & Sassy Sauce  The beef is unbelievably tasty with a great texture and cooked to a recommended medium/medium wellness. Don't be afraid of the jalapenos if you're heat-averse, they really add more taste than spice. I thought the fries were ok, but the burger is where it's at.   Aside from the beef, you'll find a large selection of craft beer and real sugar sodas. The staff is super friendly and made the whole experience a good one. My only complaint is that there isn't a location closer to Tempe/Chandler, otherwise you'd have to pull me away.",

    "text": "We drove into Scottsdale to go to Hopdoddy for a beer and burger the other night.  We live about 10 miles away and it's always been a good experience with burgers that are probably worth driving 20 miles to get.  But not this time.     Right from the start things didn't go right.  The ordering process was a bit awkward because there were no other customers and we walked right up.  When I asked for a few minutes to look the menu over I felt like I was inconveniencing the person behind the counter (normally you have time to look the menu and beer list over while in line).  Unfortunately I was told that the beer on the menu I wanted was unavailable.  Then when our food arrived they didn't ask if we needed any condiments (hello... I have fries here plus I asked for no mayo which might mean I'll put mustard on it?).  So I walked back to the area they keep the condiments as the staff watched me while talking.    Then something must have went wrong in the burger cooking process because it was way too salty.  I suspect they might use the same salt shakers in the kitchen that they have on the tables (those ones that you grind to dispense). The reason I say that is that the fries had zero salt so I picked up the one on the table and when I turned it over to put some on the fries, before even touching the grinder, a ton of salt sitting on the top went onto my fries.  So now those were also too salty.  Grrr...  I sat and waited for someone to come by and ask me if everything was ok, however no one ever came back to see if we needed anything else.  So I drank my beer which was cold and good.     The reason I gave them an A-Ok on this review was because our other experiences here have always been good.  Everyone has an off day from time to time.  Right?",

I read a few before arriving here about ordering system being a quite confusing and it was in fact confusing for the first timer. I quickly understood the table number system but after I ordered, I wasn't sure if I needed to bring condiment to my table or not.  Server brought our burgers first and they were really good, but I had to slow down on eating as no sign of fries. I had to ask more than twice before they finally brought fries, by then I finished eating my hamburger, and was ready to leave.  Manager stopped by if there is anything else we needed, by then I didn't need anything else. Only if he came before fries arrived...  Too bad I didn't enjoy service as much as I enjoyed my food. I may come back for more good food without expecting much of service.",

On our last visit here they had made a mistake and got one of our children's orders wrong and then it took a long time to get the replacement which was disappointing and should have been rushed. On top of that we decided to order a milkshake after the kids finished and the girl really sweet but had lost our receipt so we had no way to leave a tip or know what we were charged ? The concept of having to go to the counter and order your food. I know to most this may seem like such a silly complaint but for family with young children it's a bit of a pain. I also wish they would offer some chicken tenders for kids menu. We would eat here more often if this was an option picky kids. But that aside I love their food and will continue to come back. Their milkshakes are so good fries you name it I've never had a bad item here.",

But, when we're in the area, we always arrange time to stop by at Hopdoddy's.  We have a few family members that are gluten intolerant.  Hopdoddy's has a delicious gluten-free bun--so I'm told.  They have these amazing \"home-made\" sodas.  I'm not a soda person as I mainly drink water.  But, when I'm here, I make sure to get the cherry soda and sometimes the root beer.  The people here are great!  I walked up to the place where they hand out the food as the waitress was very busy and I didn't want to bother her.  The bartender saw me stop near the service counter and she approached me and asked if she can help me.  I asked for some pickles and she gave some to me.  I thought that it was great that the employees see a customer that needs help and takes the initiative to help them even if it's out of their \"area of work.\"  We have a large family so it is a little pricey when you add everything up but it's so worth the price for great food, great service and a very comfortable restaurant.  If you haven't checked out Hopdoddy's yet--give them a try!  You'll love them like we do!",

As other reviews have complained, ordered my food, was told to sit at table 23. Proceed to table 23 and find a family sitting there.  Get back in line and explain. They tell me to go to 21. Go to 21. Watch my beer being delivered to family at table 23.   WHY DO YOU MAKE IT SO DIFFICULT??   Other complaints:  the beers come in a giant heavy margarita glass that literally weighs 5 pounds when full.  You pay up front and they have a tip jar. So do I tip the guy who pushed 4 buttons and the people who deliver my food? Do I just tip at the table? The receipt has the 15%,18%,20% breakdown, but I don't really have a server so I don't feel like I need to tip that much.  The burger was good though. So you got that going for you.",

    "text": "Went back to Hopdoddy today after about a 6 month break from it. We waited in line, and were assigned to table 25 by the hostess. When we arrived at the register our order was taken and assigned to table 25.  The woman behind the register asked if we wanted anything from the bar, and I said I thought we ordered bar drinks from our server. She informed me that they have yet again changed the flow of the restaurant and now everyone was to order everything and pay for everything at the counter. I joked with her that every single time we come to the restaurant it's different and she laughed and agreed with me. So I ordered my beer with her, paid, and we headed to table 25.  Surprise surprise, some other woman and her 2 daughters are at table 25. So I asked her if that was her assigned table, and she told me she just sat down there and a waitress came and took her order. I explained to her that we waited in line like we were supposed to and were assigned that table, and she basically told me too bad. She also told me someone just tried to bring her a beer that wasn't hers. Yup, mine. So I found the hostess and told her what happened and they still let this woman steal my table.  They assigned us to a different, much less desirable table right in front of the door, and while they did finally get our food to the correct place no one ever brought me that beer. I went up to the bar and explained and the bartender happily poured me a new one.  What a mess. This is the most disorganized restaurant I have ever been to. They constantly change the flow of the restaurant which is probably why the employees never seem to have any idea what is going on. I used to think the food was so good that I could put up with the aggravation, but tonight's visit changed my mind. My Buffalo Bill was undercooked and my portion of fries was paltry. I won't be back, which is sad because I used to be a huge fan. I've just been jerked around enough by this place.",

The burgers here are delicious - not to mention that they are incredibly fresh. You can actually see a room where workers prepare and grind the fresh patties!   They also have a great selection of yummy burger combinations on their menu. My personal favorite is the \"el Diablo\" burger with jalapenos, habaneros, caramelized onion, and spicy mayo. But be warned! Don't get this burger unless you have a good handle on spice! They do a great job with their non-beef burgers like the veggie and ahi tuna burger, so don't feel like you have to get red meat! Plus, they have a good selection of beers and TO DIE FOR shakes and truffle fries - these are an absolute must to get!  The ambiance is great; I love how they always have a ton of string lights decorating the building. The service is also very friendly, attentive, and surprisingly fast for burgers. All around a very nice burger place!",

My new work-from-home schedule has recently allowed me to try more of the spots in my neighborhood, and I have already visited this one twice.  Possibly the most awesome thing about Hopdoddy is they're all about quality, and that is reflected in something as simple as their fountain drinks.  Coke or Pepsi?  Nope.  They have Maine Root, the purveyors of one of the finest ginger beers around.  Inexplicably, they have pretty much every Maine Root soda besides the ginger brew, but they have other fine offerings besides.  I don't remember which burger I had my first visit, but it was fantastic, and cooked a perfect medium rare.  Next visit, I had the Greek, because I love lamb burgers, but this one tasted too much like a salad for my taste.  Still decent, but not a top-notch lamb burger.  The truffle fries, as well as the regular kennebec fries, are pretty good.  I'm not about to declare this place the best burger joint in the city, but it's definitely worth an occasional visit if you're in the area.",

I always order the Primetime burger which comes with caramelized onions, arugula, and a delicious truffle aioli. The truffle aioli is warm and tangy but also leaves a wonderful aftertaste that will make you salivate even after your meal. The fries are delicious the service is orderly and for dessert? The milkshakes are too die for. Highly recommend Hopdoddy burger bar.",

Upon entering, I thought I finally found my go to burger joint.  There is a nice bar next to the ordering line with only local beers in tap.  Sweet!  There are televisions placed through out the restaurant playing the nfl playoff game so I was excited to try the place out.     The ordering system was a bit confusing.  But we finally settled on the Buffalo Bill ( Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce) with both garlic truffle and regular fries. From there you are assigned a seat.  They took awhile to put our number on our assigned seat.  I had wandered around the place looking for our number awkwardly carrying drinks and condiments before I realized it wasn't placed yet.   I thought my burger was underwhelming.  It was lukewarm by the time we got it.  The garlic fries were very good.  Everyone else looked like they were enjoying whatever burger they had ordered.    The employees that worked there were very nice.  They were efficient except for that bit of a wait for our seat in a almost empty restaurant.  My first experience was okay but I something tells me to come back and try something else.    I give this place a B-   Due to confusing ordering system, my lukewarm burger, and long wait to sit in an almost empty restaurant",

They warned us in advance that the burger is cooked medium rare which is exactly how we like. When it came out all 4 of our burgers were fully well done without the jalepenos and some of the amazing flavor from our first visit. Long story short it was inconsistent, leaving us still craving that first amazing burger experience.  I will say the service is great, so is the atmosphere and concept.   We are going to give it another chance because we LOVED our first visit so much. Please cook it medium rare next time! :-) it's a burger joint, and that's pretty important.",

Sat at the bar and both bartenders personally introduced themselves to us and took care of us through out our meal... Made sure our beer/water glasses were never dry.  Food was awesome. Ordered the Diablo burger... Actually has strips of habanero on it. This is the burger I've been searching for all my life. A real deal burger with some burn... And being able to wash it down with some San tan hop knot just made it a perfect night in my eyes. ... I might also Menton that their home made margaritas are out of this world. If you enjoy a good marg Don't leave without experiencing one.  My only let downs....  the bottom of the burger bun was soggy and though the truffle Fry's were amazing... Seemed like all we had in or basket was bits n pieces... Almost like bottom of the bag.   4.5 stars, rounded to 5",

But then you notice the empty tables, and wonder why they dont seat the 25 minute line outside. They can take drink orders as you wait but once youre allowed inside, theres more of the same line to order your food. A server or hostess , I'm not sure who, walks up and asks how many we have and then says, \"Im going to go find you a table and I'll be back.\" My impression is that this is really inefficient. People running back and forth trying to keep track with paper and pen where we can sit... I would consider getting an ipad or some electronic reader that people can mark off unavailable seats and it updates in real time.   We order, get our condiments,  and drinks, only to now go look for our seat in a section they assigned us. Wasnt hard by the way but still had to look for it.  Food came soon after: red velvet <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fshake-bomb.com&s=afc0082990e017a85391207b7c1b630435ed6c827dcb3f13448429120d79d6f6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">shake-bomb.com</a>, prime time burger- great but I couldnt really taste the brie, CARAMELIZED ONIONS ARE OH MY GOD GOOD, el diablo burger was spicy as hell but awesome, chile con queso fries are stupid good and the queso on the diablo is ridunculous.  Overall really damn good food and i really give it 4.5 stars but just slightly disappointed with the inefficiency.",

    "text": "Legit contender to the burger wars. As far as I know, at this time, this location is the only one outside of Texas. And it is very good.   Order in a line, get assigned a table, go grab your drink and sit at said table. They will find you and bring you your food. awesomely simple and efficient. My Mushroom Burger was very good, incredibly juicy. Wife had a Kale salad with a well seasoned and absolutely delicious turkey burger patty. I was surprised how tasty the turkey was and this hard core beefivor would actually consider one next time. Parmesan truffle fries were an incredible addition as was the vanilla bean and cinnamon shake. Just wow. The shakes alone might be worth the trip.  Great casual/hip environment, lots of craft beer choices, full adult bar libations, organic items as much as they can be found locally.... This place is a hit. Definitely now in our monthly rotation. #loveit",

Went in Sunday night with the girlfriend and was excited to see they were still a good amount of people around 8pm.   We ordered the Primetime, Arugula Salad and some fries. The fries came out right away and they were really good with the chipotle ketchup. Once the food came out I was impressed with the look of both our meals. Took a bite of my burger and it was like warm at best. I ordered medium rare but that means a warm red center not cold. The server took the plate away and came back shortly after informing me that medium rare came like that... The arugula salad was amazing and was pretty jealous of my girlfriends meal. The manager came back with my new burger and this one was hot and a lot better but still bland.   Was expecting a lot more after I had built this place up in my mind.",

The strawberry arugula salad is also pretty amazing, but a little too sweet for my salad tastes.   They have a nice beer list and serve them in frozen mugs - they really hit the spot. Also the fries are to die for.   Not the nicest place in town or the cheapest...but it does the trick!",

The burgers are really good.  The fries are terrific.    It was $28 for 2 burgers and 1 side ... that seems like a lot, but these aren't your average burgers, so they might just be worth it.  Not worth it, though: the wait.  Sometimes when you go, the line to order is pretty long.  Then you sit down and wait for your food for a pretty long time, too.  I would rather sit down and wait for a server, then maybe have some complimentary waters or fries brought out for while we wait.  As it is, it's just a lot of waiting.    I definitely do not recommend Hopdoddy for To-Go.  They don't allow you to call in a To-Go order, so you have to come in, wait in that long line, sit at a table while no one helps you (most recently I waited 30 minutes for my food), and then go.  Instead of To-Go, that should be called To-Go-Eventually.    If you've got some friends/family to hang out with and you're not in a rush, you will enjoy Hopdoddy.  Otherwise, there are lots of great burger places to check out instead.",

While I'm not overly fond of the stand in line to get a table formula,  It works out in a first come first serve basis which allows the kitchen to dish out the burgers in a proper order.    Happy hour here is phenomenal with 2 dollars off your burger at two different times.  Spending 6 dollars for an exquisite burger during happy hour will bring me back time and time again.  Don't quote me on the times but it was 3-6pm and then a late night happy hour as well.",

    "text": "I'll start off by going out on a limb and saying that this place has the best burger I have ever had ! EVERYONE MUST TRY THIS PLACE!   Honestly it's delicious, and the place is so great because they have all types of burgers, ranging from the most simple to the most elaborate. I'm a classic burger kind of gal, so if you're classy too and go with the classic burger you won't be disappointed. Be mindful of the sassy sauce because it is definitely a hit or miss depending on your taste buds, it can't hurt to get it on the side! In addition, they have PICKLES!! Not one type of pickle either.. we got two types to choose from ladies and gents and they are tasty. If you take walks on the wild side, any of the other burgers you go with are made to perfection, it really just comes down to how mature your pallet is because they have some crazy options here that won't let you down.   Lets talk about the meat. The fact that the cows are humanely raised, antibiotic free AND the meat is ground fresh, in house, every day. It's really good for you and they don't make it crazy expensive because of it. Lets be honest, all pretentious jokes aside, the meat really does taste better and you will never get one of those gross gritty bites that meat has sometimes.   THE FRENCH FRIES!!! both types are killer, you must try both at some point when you are extra hungry.  THE BEER!! so many options, and you get it in this glass gauntlet that makes you feel like you're in Beowulf, in the mead hall celebrating a victory.   THE FOUNTAIN DRINKS! they are all so different and diverse, if you stand there for a few minutes and try them all they don't get mad at you- BONUS  GLUTEN FREE BUN! it's amazing and it tastes like a biscuit. It is also messy as ever but your eating a burger anyways.  For the people that don't like this place because its not traditional, don't be so boring!! The atmosphere is really cool, and they set it up differently then anywhere else I've been to. Go in, let them show you the ropes, and when you order something extra at the table and they bring you a separate check for the extra items ordered, don't be mad!! Did you think it would be free? Blasphemy! Long line on a Friday night? YOU MUST WAIT IN IT! Totally worth it. Last but not least, the staff is friendly and you can tell they all love working at such an awesome place!",

French Fries were 70% broken stubs looks like we got the end of a the bag average again not super warm.  Which I can't understand how food just coming out of kitchen is not HOT!  Servers were nice but when we said the meal was less than average they asked why, we told them our experience, said we could had sent it back and they want us to have a great experience. That was it... No follow up from anyone else no manager, supervisor etc, you can always save a less than mediocre experience by letting someone else know they care i.e. manager.    Had TV's on for the playoff game but no sound they were playing music so probably better places to watch a big NFL game.  Odd seating and ordering process you have to order first in line then get your seat, no real chance to \"Study or ask questions on the menu\", just plain weird to us.   All in all won't be coming back for just a $9 burger anytime soon.",

At first, the setup is strange, but the more I thought about it it makes sense. You are required to stand in line to order your food, all the while standing by the bar and beer taps. At first awkward, however, the move is genius. For all of us beer fiends out there, this is your perfect chance to order a brew and sip on it in line while cashing out at the bar.  Secondly, while you're in line they bring around samples of their milkshakes. \"Do you want a free sample of our vanilla bean milkshake?\" Uhhh, yes I do, thank you very much.   Third, the burgers are awesome. Perfectly sized and cooked just right, they come a-la-carte and you're going to have to order your fries separately, but they're large enough to share. My go-to when I'm at Hopdoddy is the Goodnight Burger (add bacon and make it a \"Great\"night), with the truffle fries. Do yourself a favor and pick up some of their homemade BBQ sauce for dipping, its delicious. Don't forget to follow everything up with their salted caramel milkshake. They give you an extra large straw so you're almost guaranteed to get a brain freeze - totally worth it.  The great thing about the madness of ordering through the line when you first arrive is that you get a \"server\" to take care of you once you've sat down and when you're done eating you've already paid (unless you got dessert or another beer - womp womp)! You can wipe the burger off your face and peace out whenever you like, no waiting on a check.  I highly, highly recommend Hopdoddy Burger Bar when you're looking for some bomb burgers to stuff in your face.",

    "text": "Pretty much everything that could be said about the maddening/idiotic ordering system has been said. We came early on a Friday (had to wait outside behind the \"velvet rope\" for about 10 minutes) and I absolutely know had we gotten there later (and as the line grew) my boyfriend wouldn't have even entertained the thought to wait longer out there. And I wouldn't even try to come here with more than four people.  We talked about how OF COURSE college kids in Austin are fine with waiting in line, drinking fishbowls of beer and dealing with the seating system, but what happens in Scottsdale in August at 115 degrees? Who the hell is going to be OK with waiting then?  (Yes, I saw they have misters, but give me a break)  That all said, the food was delicious and the price point was pretty great. Two burgers and an order of fries came out to under $21. I had their lone veggie burger, the La Bandita. The menu says it's a black bean/corn patty, but, due to it's rosy hue, it had to also contain beets (fine by me, just a note.) I subbed the goat cheese for pepperjack, and that combined with the avocado, arugula and cilantro pesto (no mayo for me) made for a dang tasty burger. Boyfriend had the El Diablo, topped with pepperjack, Carmelized Onions, Habanero and Serrano Chiles, Salsa Roja (no mayo for him either) and he loved it. We split a regular order of their regular fries (skinny, perfectly salted) and it was definitely enough to share. I can only imagine how ridiculous the fries with queso are.  So yeah, we'd love to be back for the food, but it all 100% depends on the line situation. Kind of a shame, really.",

    "text": "I'm not one to crave a burger very often but if I did, I would definitely come here. There has been a line out the door the 2 times I have been there, but I was not in a rush so didn't mind.  They assign you a table right before you're about to order and I've been lucky each time as to get a \"private\" table, since they sometimes seat you at a table where other people are seated and put some BS divider on the table to give the illusion you are separated. All that does is prevent you from looking at the person's food who you are sitting right next to. You are still sitting next to them and can see them clearly so don't see how that helps anything.  Moving on. I had The Goodnight burger because the carmelized onions, jalapenos and sassy sauce (assumed it was the house sauce and was right) caught my eye. I really like the bun they use too. Delicious! I favor light beers so tried the one from Grand Canyon Brewing Co. and I loved it. This will definitely be my beer of choice when I return.  I absolutely hated the milkshakes. Ordered a chocolate one and it was so bad that I asked to switch it for a different flavor which they did with no problems at all. I got the vanilla and it was just as bad as the chocolate. There's some kind of weird cinnamon number on it and it tastes awful.  Definitely stick to the burgers and beer combo!  The staff is very young but very nice and professional.",

My friend and I just ordered burgers from Hopdoddy, as well as two orders of French fries from a food delivery app -- for quite the pretty penny -- and no ketchup, dipping sauces, or napkins. I guess we're supposed to eat it bland, then wipe our hands on our clothes? Thanks, I think.   The burgers are pretty good... I mean the typical burger, but nothing over-the-top extravagant where you should pay so much for a burger. But when you're hungry, pricing tends to go out the window when you're craving a specific burger.   Quite disappointed on the delivery of our order though; specifically the lack of customer service with our order. I mean, if we order TWO orders of French fries, you would think they would send SOME kind of sauce, no?! Am I asking for too much here?!   I called Hopdoddy to ask why our order was lacking attention (ie. ketchup and napkins), and was told that \"No, we don't include any ketchup or dipping sauces unless specified.\" Umm... What about napkins though? Please, Hopdoddy, tell me where on God's green earth would I enter this information when ordering via food delivery app? I would think ketchup and napkins would be common sense/courtesy... where is the customer service? I get you guys are probably super busy, but c'mon -- ketchup? Really? Especially after spending so much on a small order... quite disappointing.",

You know how you walk up to a mall food joint, go to the counter, order your food, then sit down... So, if I order my food at the front and then wait for someone to bring my food to the table- no server... why is there a line to add tip? Why should I tip when drinks and condiments are self serve? Burgers are good though. My mood changes for what I prefer. The Greek burger is made with lamb. That's good. I love the Llano Poblano but get it as a turkey burger.

    "text": "Definitely a strong option for your counter style burgers, but just different enough if you're tired of the typicals like In-N-Out or Five Guys.  It's a weird setup. They ask you how big your party is, assign you a table, order and pay at the counter, then bring your food to you. I think it works fine when you're able to get seating, but when were there for a Saturday dinner, that line ended up being past the door for over an hour when seats just weren't freeing up. In other burger joints there's a more steady flow, but I feel the seating gives customers a sense of entitlement and less of a need to vacate for others. I saw at least two families with kids upset they had to go to-go.  But on the bright side, the meat options were pretty promising. They had a great variety of secondary proteins, like bison, tuna, kobe beef, or even the Impossible Burger! My friend and I split that last one as well as the Poblano. The Poblano was incredibly juicy with good spice. The Impossible Burger, while had decent flavor and the bloody juice looked promising, isn't exactly ready yet. It falls apart quite easily and bites more like mush after a little while. Honestly we both would have preferred an Impossible Chili if that's the case.  The fries were solid as always. For all 3 premium versions, it's fries on the side with dip in the cup. It's convenient if you want to split with friends since it's not messy, and good for friends who just want fries.  I also had the oreo shake but boozy. They added Bailey's for 3 bucks but it looks like it could have been any shot. I liked them together, but the Oreos weren't really bended well and blocked even my boba sized straw.  Definitely a place I'd come back to in the future. But like the Impossible Burger, some dishes were better than others. Possibly you'll have to figure that out on your own.",

We asked questions in regards to the menu and was very short. My friend was placing a separate order and she refused to take her order and advised her to go with the other cashier. We ordered three lemonades and she proceeded to give us three cups for our drinks. We've been in this restaurant several times and we know lemonades are prepared in the bar. She insisted we keep the cups.  The food was good with the exception of the green chilly fries. The cheese was water down.  My friend's lemonade was water down and she requested a new lemonade. Our lemonades never arrived until we asked a couple of times.  Overall, the hamburgers, fries and sweet potatoes were very good as always.  Not sure if anything changed with management but waiting times should be addeesde.",

    "text": "Eating dinner at Hopdaddy Burger Bar was a spur of the moment decision after our party of 6 couldn't get a table at our first choice. But it was an excellent change in plans.   Hopdoddy has a parking lot with outdoor seating and spacious dinning area. When we arrived, we easily got a table and then got in line to place our order at the register. All the burgers looked delicious, which encouraged me to order both the Ahi Tuna Burger and Primtime.   The food arrived quickly and I ate it even faster. I tried the Ahi Tuna Burger first, which was amazing. The tuna was not sour or fishy and the condiments of nori chips and pickled ginger was an great addition. But what really made me like this burger was the honey wasabi, sweet and spicy/hot. The Primetime did not disappoint either with flavorful meat, sweet caramelized onions and creamy brie. I really enjoyed the soft, toasty buns both burger came on also. To top it off I ordered a side of truffle fries.   Service was fantastic at the ordering counter, providing suggestions on what to order and recommendation for how to cook the protein. The counter across from where you place your order is an assortment of sauces, including ketchup, chipotole ketchup, mustard, honey mustard, and an aioli. I just wish that I had more room in my stomach for more burgers and a milkshake.  What I recommend: -- Ahi Tuna Burger -- Primetime",

I was excited with anticipation because of all the reviews.   When we first walked in, we were greet with a smiling face and handed a menu. It seems like a lot of newly opened place are using this system. Order and pay then they will serve you at your table. One difference between the other places is Hopdoddy reserves your table while you wait in line.   I ordered the Buffalo Bill Burger which is buffalo and the Kennebec fries. I really enjoyed it. Nice and juicy with lettuce, tomato, and bacon. Yum yum. The fries were so fresh. I ordered a large fries to split with my family. They were so hot (temp). Everyone couldnt stop eating the fries. My wife ordered the Continental Club Burger which is the Turkey burger with grilled onions. She really enjoyed the burger which is surprising because she never likes burgers. I tried it and it was really juicy and cooked perfect. Really good.   The service was surprisingly good. Once we sat at our booth, our server introduced herself and said that she was going to take care of us. She brought us out all of their different ketchups. She was even willing to fill up our drinks even through the drinks are self serve. The trays were cleared from our table in a timely manner.   Overall, I wasn't disappointment. I had a really good time and good food. Enjoy cause I sure did.",

Let's start with the food... it is fantastic! There is an interesting variety of burgers on the menu and everything we've tried has been scrumptious! The burgers could be just a tad bigger, but the flavor is fantastic! There are milkshakes and my kids loved them! Fries are sold separately so the cost does add up, but again it's really really good food. Now for the service...also really good! It's an interesting set up, you walk to the counter to order and they assign you a table. Your food is delivered and servers provide refills, etc. and although you order at a register you pay at the end. The assigned seating thing wasn't managed well on our second visit as they'd set a man and his two small children at a table for six leaving our party of five to squeeze into a table for four with a chair at the end. Not the end of the world but clearly saving the larger tables for larger groups needs to be a priority. I was taken aback when they asked if we would be okay splitting up - uhm no! Not the end of the world but an opportunity.  The environment is very nice and well maintained. It's comfortable and relatively quiet for the size of the restaurant. Thumbs up to this place!",

The entire concept is a complete mess. You stand in line to wait to order your food, but there are no menus readily available so you then stand at the counter trying to figure out what you want to order while everyone else impatiently waits behind you. Then, you get assigned a table (without paying) where you are greeted by server who does absolutely nothing the entire time you are there and then you wait for your food, which is the followed by waiting to receive your check...  So what I'm trying to say is, if you like waiting around, you should come here.  Our \"server\" forgot that we asked for dipping sauce (There is literally nothing else they had to remember) then questioned us when we asked for it again.   The burgers are tasty, but small for the price. Plus, they don't even come with French fries.   If you ignore all of the waiting, it has a hip atmosphere which would definitely be a cool place to hang out, but overall, not amused by this restaurant.",

We get to our table and everything comes out except the fries. We of course asked the food runner and he said didn't order fries. We didn't have the receipt to confirm and the cashier said we didn't order them so they asked us to go stand in (the long) line again to pay for more fries. It wasn't even worth it at that point... but it just says something about a restaurant that they won't even take your word and bring you fries you paid for.   We waited a long time before giving HopDoddy another chances. This time we sat down at the bar. It took the bartender 10 minutes to notice us before we were asked if we wanted a drink.   Overall just disappointing experiences. My boyfriend is from Austin, TX and has now sworn off this AZ location. The Ahi Tuna burger is a good concept, but the wasabi aioli is way too powerful and ruins the burger. I had the turkey burger last time and that was good, but nothing amazing. I don't eat beef so I think I would only come back for the milkshakes. I can't say anything bad about those milkshakes!",

My friend had the Goodnight burger but I didn't try any.  We were both very pleased that they served local beers while also sourcing products from local vendors, like the Singh Farms Honey.

When he looked on Hopdoddy's website and found out they were from Texas, he was really interested in trying it.  I remember seeing this place on South Congress in Austin before.  If it's on Soco, it's gotta be good.    He ordered the Goodnight burger and I ordered the Llano Poblano burger.  We got a small side of fries, which really was only big enough for one person, so when we go back, we will be upgrading to the large to share.  The Llano Poblano has grilled poblano peppers, bacon, onion, tomato, and some sort of delectable sauce on it.  The Goodnight burger had fresh jalapeno and the best grilled onions my hubby had ever had.    They have a great local beer list, including beers from Phx and Flagstaff.  If you are jonesing for an AZ craft brew, this is the spot to go.  Our only knock on this whole place though, were the huge goblets that the beer comes in.  Those goblets are better suited for margaritas or a drink you can drink with a straw.  They are a little cumbersome and unstable for good hard beer drinking.  Overall, there is no question that we will be back!  I'm already craving that Chipotle ketchup again!!",

I opted for the lamb burger and wasn't disappointed.  the burger had cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, and a great tzatziki sauce.  My friend had a regular cheeseburger of some sort and it was just as spectacular.  The burgers are absolutely enormous, so be forewarned.  We split the truffle parmesean fries and they were crispy, decadent, and fresh.    As we sat and ate and drank we noticed some monsterous milkshakes being taken to tables and we were very jealous.  However due to the size of the portions, we were very very full.   Next time I will not only split the fries, but split a burger so that I can then split a shake!  The logistics here can be a little confusing. You walk UP to a counter and place your order. They then tell you a table number to go sit at and your drinks are there waiting.  (beer is served on tap or via bottles as well as fancy soda).  After you sit at your table you are then introduced to you server.  They then bring your food to you and serve any other tiems you may order. Weird, but it works.    Nice low key/casual place for a great burger.",

This place will not be open very long and they don't deserve to be!! I've had much better at a fast food place for a fraction of the cost.",

We tried the classic burger and the \"Llano Poblano\" with the regular fries. The burgers are juicy and cooked right with good beef flavor. I was glad to see they are not asking $10+ for all of their burgers, just one of them.  The fries are pretty good and there's enough for two unless you're in a gluttonous mood.  The highlight of the meal was their $5 milkshake- the caramel sea salt. I'm asked weekly to go back for one.",

The \"chefs\" do not know the difference between well done and raw meat which means they're open to hiring anyone to work in the kitchen (No culinary experience needed) & serving you up a nice undercooked burger. It seems mastering the technique of a well cooked burger is not in the cards for this establishment; after flipping so many burgers on a daily basis, they still fall short. I placed an order over the phone for pick up and specified that I wanted the burger to be \"medium Well\". I get home and end up biting into a practically raw burger. The cow might as well have been lying on the table saying \"moo\" it was so freaking raw! Completely unacceptable. I have a sensitive stomach. I was not feeling well. I asked for a well done burger for a freaking reason and now I have to deal with an onset of additional sickness / food poisoning because HopDoddy can't seem to get a simple order request Right! Not ok for being in the food industry. Set better expectations and a more promising experience for your paying / potential customers in order to survive & maintain business. Thanks for the E.

I felt pressured to order quickly without asking questions because of the line behind me. I get to my table and a lady holding a margarita gives me my drink. Later, a man brings our food. (We were told that we would have a server, but were never introduced to anyone.) It looks great, but they put sassy sauce all over my boyfriend's burger (which he hates.) All my guy would have needed was a new bun. He ate half, probably because he felt bad since I paid. Nobody comes back to check on us. I wait a while to see if I can flag someone down to order a shake once I was almost done eating. Nobody in sight,  so we walked up to the counter. Pretty lame concept.  If you want us to walk up to the counter for everything,  dont give us the impression that we will get service at a table.   The food:  Wow! This is a pretty good burger. They use quality ingredients and it shows. The parmesan fries are to die for. Ive had similar style fries elsewhere,  but they are always loaded with oil or butter. Gross. These were dry, crispy, and just perfect. I ate every last bite of my meal. My $6 margarita was strong. Even the soda fountain was impressive. No high fructose corn syrup, just cane sugar. I can appreciate a buisness that goes the extra mile to produce quality products all around. We ended with a shake, and it was the best! My man called the extra wide shake straw \"dangerous\" since we were sharing, and it was easy to drink quickly, lol!",

They don't take your name & how many and give you an approximate wait time, you just wait in this line until it is your turn. Once it is your turn you go to the counter to order & pay for your food. It is also during this time that you are assigned your table #, where you will be sitting. I found it a bit odd that the receipt had the option to write in a tip before you experienced the service but I suppose you could leave that at zero and leave cash on the table. Also while waiting in line a server made the rounds asking if anyone wanted a drink. I ordered a beer and rather than having that added onto my bill I paid her separately. After ordering you sit and wait for the server to bring you your food. One positive note is that since you already paid when you are finished you can leave whenever, you don't have to try to find your server to get your check and settle up. I will say that the food was amazing. I ordered the Buffalo Bill and the cashier made the comment that was her favorite. When the server came & was identifying the burgers while passing them out when she came to my Buffalo Bill she also commented how that was her favorite. They weren't lying...this was an awesome burger!! I could say it was on par with Gordon Ramsay BurGR @ Planet Hollywood (at least my burger was). I was very pleased with the beer selection too...all local breweries, $5 for a good size amount. I would make a return visit.",

I love this restaurants food and wanted to show my fiance how amazing it was too, since he had never been.   Big fail.   Here goes...  The lady that took our order accidentally told us and the couple in front of us the same table number... the server apologized to the people sitting at the table we were also given and we were told to go find a table inside. Unfortunately, we ended up sitting in that same servers section. He never apologized for the confusion but instead told \"hope there aren't anymore issues and I'll be your server\". No smile, no apology for their error, nothing. He left and interacted with the people still sitting at the other table we were given (as we could clearly see them through the giant glass window), but he never even came back to check on us at all until the bill was given to us. Both people that made the mistake walked by our table several times, ignoring us completely and I never even saw a manager walk by at all and ended up leaving very frustrated.   WORST experience I have ever had. I just love their food but I will never go back to this location. Thanks for ruining my favorite place to stop for burgers.",

    "text": "This place was a lot to take in and certainly not what I was expecting.  There was plenty of good to go along with plenty of bad.  First of all, the place was packed on a weeknight, but their inane ordering system can't support a crowd.  You wait in line until a table is ready... but then you order at a counter anyway.  It seems like an elaborate ruse to keep you standing next to their beer taps, which was a fine local selection.  Food is reasonable ($8 burgers, $5 shakes) because they make it back on the $6 draughts.  But the drinking aspect of the experience keeps people at their tables longer, which makes the line move slower.  IT'S MADDENING!  We were starving by the time we got our food.  Fries came first and they were good, but not outstanding.  (We probably should have ordered the truffle fries, which looked good and have been getting rave reviews.)  The burgers were flavorful on a brioche bun with a mayonaise  based sauce, but they meat was too salty and too greasy for my taste.  The raspberry shake was thin and unspectacular, but the nutella pretzel shake was one of the best shakes I've had in my life.  Sure, the pretzels were so big that many couldn't fit through the straw, but that left a spoonable pretzel treat at the bottom of the cup.  Also, they had several housemade ketchups and sauces which were actually pretty good.  Everyone from Pittsburgh considers himself a ketchup connoisseur and these actually weren't offensive to me.  The decor was nice.  Happy hour prices looked really inviting, although I can only imagine the crowd.  Hopdoddy did enough to bring me back, but they're still suspect in my book.",

Its all about that shake, shake, the one with caramel and sea salt. YUM!!!  Don't get me wrong the burger here are great as well. Actually I think anyone opening a burger joint should eat here 1st and see how it is done right. Well 95 percent right. My only complaint is the disconnect between the register and seating. Was her twice in two weeks and had the same issue both time. Once it was slammed(so it might have made since) and the other was just casual traffic. Don't really get the issue here. Okay on to the food. The only other thing that some might not like is the price here. Not a cheapo burger so be prepared to spend a little more in this joint.   Burgers are top notch. I even tried the chicken burger this last time and it might be my new favorite. Always love the chipotle ketchup on the fries, or even the garlic aioli. Trust me when I say this don't leave with out trying the salted caramel milkshake. As for as I am concerned best milk shake ever.",

My first visit was a Yelptastic experience, in which I was fortunate to be able to taste several types of burgers and chicken too but it was definitely the Ahi tuna that made me return. I'd been bragging to the guys, my son and daughter's boyfriend how good this place is, and what guy doesn't enjoy a burger so of course I brought them to taste for themselves! We chose the pablano, a bison and the Ahi tuna along with some of their amazing fries. We ordered a couple of their In-House flavored fountain sodas, the Rootbeer and the Blueberry. I am a Diet Coke drinker perhaps even an addict but the Blueberry soda had me hooked at the first sip! To my heartbreak I was told after I had ordered that the last of the Ahi tuna had been sold,choose another burger and perhaps they'd be able to get more tuna in. Crushed and forced to choose again I went with the Diablo Burger. This little spicy number set my tastebuds on fire with heat and great flavor.The manager soon came over and apologized for the tuna shortage and went out of his way to make it up to us. Fabulous food and customer to match, we will definitely be back!",

I understand why they went with this seating arrangement. If a place is crowded all the time this allows people to get through faster. However, I find it hard to justify standing for that long. There are very few places where I would stand in line Disneyland style for a meal. XOXO in Chicago is worth the wait (sometimes standing for an hour). This place may not be. I would only come back in the off hours. Ok, rant over.  The food: I had the diablo burger and added a fried egg and bacon. Very good. Far spicer than I would have guessed. My little dude had a plain cheese burger. Most of which he rubbed on his face then threw on the floor. He did seem to like it though. My lady had the ahi burger which she stated was \"really good\". We all enjoyed the truffle fries.  Great food, good beers, nice place, prepare to stand for a bit. Worth checking out.",

It turns out that with careful ordering, you can get a pretty good meal here but there are still rough edges.  Specifically -- 1.  Stick to the plain beef hamburger and add a couple of simple extras if you want.  Lettuce, tomato, onions, sassy sauce -- these are fine but the hot sauce is sour, the bacon gets lost in the other flavors, and the chili is a mushy mess. (The egg bun is doughy; try the whole wheat). 2.  Eat your fries as an appetizer as they suggest - they come out crisp but quickly get soggy. 3.  Make sure you tell them what you want served first, if not the fries.  The salads are quite good and you might choose this as your starter.  They are a better value than the $5 fries. 4.  The draft beer is cold and the serving is large - one of the better values in a restaurant that is a shade overpriced on some items.",

I was brought out the classic burger instead. I explained what I had ordered and the serve picked up the bun to establish it was wrong and said he'd bring the right burger out. Just a minute later, the same burger came back out to me with poblano added to it. When I asked if it was the same burger I was told it was, and I complained because he had touched it and brought it back out. He then said he'd re-fire it for me. It was brought back out, this time with bacon. I took the bacon off, which wasn't a big deal, but was frustrating because after 3 tries, my order was still wrong. Our fries came out cold as well. At no point was a manager called, etc. Very frustrating as we come here all of the time, and now I'm not sure we'll be back for awhile.",

The other two family members in my party were disappointed that their patties were too rare, and I confirmed it with my own eyes, but they still raved about the flavor of their burgers. So maybe the consistency isn't perfect here, but I have to give this five stars for my very memorable burger and an overall great environment. Also, the delicious fries are very thin, small and crispy, slowing down their consumption and preventing diners from focusing away from their hamburgers.",

They use Angus with the lower end choices which you can expect to pay just under $9 for a burger - i.e. for the GOODNIGHT which is an award winner (I've had it a couple times).  A friend of mine has had the Ahi Tuna burger and she was happy with it.  Their website lists all their craft burgers - with the Primetime coming in at $12 list.  Expect some waiting.  Seating is assigned while your in line (when its busy which is usual).  They have a nice chipotle and a honey mustard sauce you can nab at the counter.  You get your own soft drinks.  Have fun.",

My BF and I have tried most of the burgers on the menu and have had no complaints about any of them.  Well, maybe I've complained about one or two being super messy but, in the end - who doesn't love licking sassy sauce off their fingers (and maybe their arm)?  Personally my favorite burger is the Magic Shroom.  Runner up is the Buffalo Bill, or maybe the Terlingua?  The fries are crispy, not greasy and awesome with a side of green chile queso (*drool*).  Also, the salads - yes this is a burger, fries, and shake place BUT - they make great salads!  Spinach and arugula plus a turkey burger patty is yummy and, to my surprise, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything (burger, fries, shake) when I order it.  The ordering process seems to bother some people but remember these key points...  1) The line moves FAST and the host/hostess will happily explain the process to you if you are confused 2) The servers come around with samples of fries and shakes on a frequent basis 3) The bartender will let you sample beer as you progress in line past the bar but... 4) You don't have to order your first round of drinks as you pass the bar while in line.  The bartender is only asking in case you're thirsty while in line (which you probably are, see #2).   5) Once you're at your table you'll have a server who will take care of everything for you.  Drinks?  Refills?  Sauces?  Shakes?  Yes, the server will handle all of that.  Seriously, if you haven't been - TRY IT!",

    "text": "First, I will qualify this review with the fact that we have a couple of these in Austin. We went there and were not impressed enough to even write a review. The food was OK (better than this experience), but the service was HORRENDOUS! We had a really bad server. So, why did we try this location? One word..location. We were hungry for a beer and burger and this was the closest thing at the time. So, I tried the lamb burger (labeled GREEK on the menu).TRIED! It was so overcooked and flavorless. If that was really Tzatziki sauce and not just lumpy jarred mayo blessed with a little sour cream, I apologize. There were two small pieces of pickled onion on the whole sandwich. Also, I know I need to remember that I'm back living in my beautiful desert, but does all the meat have to taste like it's just hiked up Camelback?!?!?! SERIOUSLY! I was torn on whether or not to order fries and wish I didn't. Several reviews have mentioned that they get soggy pretty fast. I thought they would taste better than fast food restaurant fries, but they didn't. The beer I had, which was a seasonal I don't remember, was cold and good! Didn't save the food, but helped. B had the Good Cause burger (good man!) and added bacon. He thought it was OK, but didn't like the BBQ sauce. This shocked me. He would bathe in BBQ sauce. He said it definitely wasn't one of the best burgers. They served his favorite Kiltlifter, so a couple of pints later, the burgers packed in take home boxes, that we knew we probably wouldn't touch again, didn't look so forlorn. The service was OK, but not spectacular and fun, like at so many other burger bar type places we've been. Football season is coming, and we need to find hangouts here and places to pick up a good burger to watch at home! Probably not going to be Hopdoddy.",

    "text": "Not your average burger joint, most definitely this sets the bar!    From the effortlessly cool interior to the locally sourced ingredients, Hoppdoddy's is far above any of its competition.   3 of us came for dinner, when you walk in you're directed to a counter to place your order, while you're waiting a waitress will come up to you and assign a table, then you can order drinks from the full bar that's to your right as you wait to place your food order.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna Burger, served perfectly rare, this sushi grade tuna is just careful seared to keep it in it's burger shape. Wonderful and delicious honey wasabi sauce mixed expertly with a hint of teriyaki and crunch of nori chips make this \"burger\" easily the best I've ever had. The soda section has all natural house made sodas with cane sugar and no corn syrup.   For dessert I ordered the Stout Chocolate shake and it was even more impressive than the main course, sweet, rich and creamy.   If you're looking for the best place to grab a gourmet burger, shake and even a drink, look no further!",

It takes the pain of having to find a seat away.   However, I was really not impressed with wait staff. They say that someone will come around to get refills, take more orders, and get anything you need. That would be great if someone ever came around.   One thing that didn't meet my expectations was the chili cheese fries. They are definitely not what you would think. There's very little \"sauce\" and it really doesn't seem like it contains any chili. It's just portrayed all wrong.",

We both agreed the size was perfect (maybe a little big), and the quality of the product exceeded our expectations.   One thing - I don't think this is a place where you go for drinks. The process of ordering and eating doesn't seem to fit well with sitting and having beers and watching a game. And honestly I think that's okay because there are enough places to do that around here anyway.   You can tip when you order or you can tip your server (this confused us at first so I asked a manager). The tips among cooks, servers, food runners etc are pooled. The bar is treated as it's own.   Bottom line, great food, great service and I place I look forward coming back to again.",

The place was very crowded, and there were no tables available. It was a Friday night around 7:30pm, so this was totally understandable and we were happy to wait. A young girl took my name and told us we were 4th on the waiting list for a table. Totally fine, again we were happy to wait. We sat outside by the complimentary water station as the inside of the restaurant was PACKED! However, we ended up sitting there for 20-25 minutes and watched 5 other parties leave. We figured we'd be the next ones seated but nobody came out to call our name. Then, we saw the party behind us in line get seated and noticed people were ordering at the counter per usual (which they told us we could not do until we had a table number). Figured something was up so I stepped inside and talked to one of the waiters. He gave me a very confused look when I told him someone had taken my name and I was waiting for a table. He then proceeded to talk to the young girl who had taken my name. This girl looked at my boyfriend and I as if she had never seen us before and had no  idea what I was talking about. She proceeded to seat us immediately but it was clear that we were forgotten about and we received no apology at all.  I was very disappointed in the customer service on this visit. The food, as always, was wonderful.",

Once we sat down, we waited at least 15 minutes. A woman brought our food and I asked for our server to be sent over. Another 20 minutes passed and once we were almost finished with our food, our server came over.

Walk in, stand in line while your table is reserved, order at the front and wait for your meal. Self serve drinks with a full bar as well (and bartender of course, that's not self serve).   I had the Ahi burger which is freshly ground. Usually when I get this option I end up with a ahi steak on a bun. This was flavorful and an interesting flavor profile. With a wasabi chip on top, greens and a sweet/tangy sauce the Ahi paired nicely. Homemade bun FTW!   This place is a must try if you're open to a great burger and fun experience. Tried the truffle fries as well. Without a drink it was $19, so not exactly cheap but a TON of food.",

    "text": "The FOOD is FANTASTIC! The EXPERIENCE was AWKWARD and made us really uncomfortable and feel a bit stupid. This place would be great if they changed the system to typical restaurant service and people could choose to sit outside or not. When first entered we saw a sign that seemed to instruct us to grab a cold one at the bar then order food and then be assigned a table. We waited for the bartender to serve us a bar but then he said if we order from him we will have to pay at bar then again for our food. If wanted to pay all together, we should order beers when we order food. But then he served us the beers and told us to tell them at register. Meanwhile while we were waiting to order beer, a lot of people passed us up and got to order before us. Then we get to the register and were told we will have to wait to order until a table becomes available. It felt weird and awkward to stand there holding a giant beer with wait staff buzzing back and forth. We felt like we were in their way. Meanwhile I am watching the kitchen and noticed who I think may have been the manager with a long beard shuffling food, filling fries, etc with his big ass beard 2 inches from food. EWWWWWWW! and I am a fan of a big beards...just not hovering over my food. We ordered and then my BFpulled out a card to pay and was told you will receive a bill at the table. Again that stupid awkward feeling. Then we walk over to sit at our assigned table but the path was filled with severs standing around because we went to the right of the register which turned about to be the servers bar station. Awkward again!!  Then I wished we could have had the option to sit outside. Had to get our own water. Our food took forever--  which is weird --  because you feel like you are ordering fast food style.  Staff was friendly so that helped a lot, but then they have to \"auction\" your food since they didn't take the order. And to top it all off, my burger came with tomato when I asked for no tomato. Good thing it's just because I don't like it and not allergic. Our bill for two burgers, small fries to share and 2 Papago Orange Blossoms was about $40. The super awkward experience made us not want to tip the usual 20%. And why should we when the only thing a server did was bring food to the table once? But damn,  that was a really really good BISON Burger and I would go back again now that I know the system. I would like to try the Biltmore location and hope they have a better ordering and seating system.",

It has 22 different ingredients just in one burger, never had anything like it. Reminds me of a major city restaurant but not as expensive because it's in Arizona. The beer is also stellar, soo much to choose from. And last the fries are addictive, just wish it would come with the meal all together instead of paying separate. Hope everyone goes and try's this great new place!!!!",

    "text": "The good: The food is absolutely amazing if it's prepared correctly. I travel a lot. The first Hopdoddy I tried was in Austin and it was phenomenal. When my bf lived in Dallas we frequented that location and it was also phenomenal. My favorite burger, so flavorful, and the chili con queso fries are amazing!  The bad: This location is no where near as amazing as the others. My favorite thing is the chili con queso fries and the last few times I've been the dip hasn't been mixed up. There's huge chunks of meat or unmelted cheese. How hard is it to stir it? They also fill up the cup less than halfway full which is nowhere near enough. Especially when you're paying $7+ for it. I always order a plain and dry classic burger. For some reason the burgers are not as flavorful here as they are at the other locations and they always overcook it. I specifically tell them medium each time (rather than the standard medium to medium well) and it always ends up medium well to well done. You pay and tip before being seated, some days service is decent some days no one says one word to you. When we first started coming we would tip 20%, but now that we realize service doesn't really happen here we tip less. Plus you order at the register and get your own drinks/sauce etc. and napkins are on the table. So service needs are minimal. I really wish it was either sit-down service or full counter. I feel guilty not-tipping, but unless I'm sitting at the bar (where I do tip 20%+) they don't do much.    Conclusion: This branch needs to step it up to be the quality of the other locations. Austin and Dallas are 5 star, Scottsdale is 4 on a good day but generally more of a 3.",

There's was Lemon/Lime infused water out in the front lobby area coming in.  What a great touch for anyone waiting in line! Kenna came over and welcomed my family at our table and assured us we were in great hands with her staff. Our server Elisa shared the Hopdoddy mission and some of the fantastic burger choices they had to offer as well as Truffles Fries, like our greeter had mentioned.  They were to die for, by the way!  Hands-down, the BEST fries ever. I chose the Goodnight burger and $1.00 of that purchase went to the Phoenix Children's hospital. The toppings were just the right amount and the egg buns, Elisa explained, were made fresh each day.  The entire restaurant was clean, friendly, and completely inviting. prices we on the mark (my opinion only)  We can't wait to go back!!!",

    "text": "These may be the best Burgers in Scottsdale. Great location, great atmosphere and the food is amazing.  Ordering is a little strange, but other than that a cool place to grab a bite.   You order at the cash register and they pick your table for you when you walk in. The food and drink are then delivered to your table. Anything else you want to add to the tab can be ordered at the table also. I'm assuming they do this to speed up the ticket time. (I would rather they NOT, but I guess you shouldn't complain about food coming out Fast.)   Bar area seems to be a great place to be, and the booths and table give you a great vantage point. No desserts here except for milk shakes so be ready for that. I had the Goodnight Burger, medium. Perfectly cooked, seasoned great and the bun was everything you need in a great Burger. (the sassy sauce is to die for also)  I would give this place 5 stars if the ordering was done like a regular spot, but 4 stars is for sure solid.",

    "text": "I was debating on what to give Hopdoddy Burger Bar rating.  3 or 4 stars?  I finally decided on a 3 star (still wish I could give half stars) based on my previous visit to the one in Austin, Tx.  I believe I gave the Austin location on Congress St. 5 stars because I had great food and a great time.  This location in Scottsdale is set up a lot differently and when I came they didn't have any other special burgers to choose from.  I really liked the Austin location where they had a system of ordering and had a chalk board of specialty burgers, along with the standard menu burgers to choose from.  Also they had a bar station while you were walking your way to the counter.  I was happy to see the Scottsdale location offering only local AZ beers as the Austin one only served local TX beers.    Well after my initial impression my wife and I shared a buffalo bill burger.  It was good, not great.  Meet was very good and bun was fresh but something about it I honestly didn't care for.  I can't base my judgment on one burger alone, so I will come back here and try another one for a more fair review.    We ordered the garlic fries and they were really good.  Price was actually not bad, but in the gourmet burger market which has seemed to really blow up in the past few years, there are other ones that I would rather go to.  Again, I will be back, the employees working were super nice and friendly, restaurant was clean, good beer selection so I will come back.  Maybe next time they will have additional burgers such as Kobe meat burger or some sort of creation.",

I went in today to a relatively slow lunch crowd...proceeded to the front and ordered two burgers and one fry for the table of 2. Sat ... Waited ... 15 minutes later ask our \"server\" what was taking so long to which she replied I know...not sure what is going on with the kitchen it's been like this all week. She then left the table. Another 10 minutes .... Still no food. We get up and find her and ask... Where is our order.... She does not come back and we watch her delver shakes and sauces to other tables. Another 10 minutes.... People behind us getting their food... I got up again and walked over to her. Asked her to pack our food to go and I wanted a refund...she graciously reminded me I hadn't paid so I told her let me know when our food is done and we will take it to go.  She does not follow up... Manager or some young guy comes out to her and asks what is going on... She tells him \"they don't want to pay\" to which he responded \"if they don't pay they don't get their food\" I looked at them both and we walked out.... The young guy did nothing to follow up and neither did our waitress. I don't care how good the food is I will not return on pure principle. Absolutely awful 42 minute experience.",

    "text": "This spot has only been open for one week and they are off to a great start! We were immediately greeted outside the front door and told to walk in and meet the hostess who would assign our table number. So you go in, take your place in line and then the hosts will come over and give you a sheet of paper with you table number. We were given menus and deciding what to order. The line goes right past the bar and the bartender wasted no time offering us a drink while we waited. He then mentioned that the seats at the bar are first come first served and full-service. So we quickly got out of line and bellied up to the bar. The beers looked really great, but being a work day, I just stuck to water. My friend and I decided to split the Poblano burger and an order of the fries with Green Chile Queso. It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to arrive, they split the fries and queso, but we had to split the burger ourselves...no biggie. The queso we got was quite red in color i think it was the chile con queso as opposed to the green chile version we ordered, but it was delicious anyway. The burger was cooked the way we asked (med-rare) and it was stacked high with toppings and the bun held up to all of the juice. I went though about 4 paper towels during the meal, which to me is a good sign when eating a burger.   I am excited to go back and enjoy some adult beverages with some of the best fries I have ever had!",

They have a long list of burger choices but I usually stick to the goodnight burger + bacon. I do wish the burgers were a bit more filling since they cost upwards of $9. I'm usually still hungry after the burger so I usually indulge in one of the milkshake specials. This is probably my favorite burger spot in the valley. Always a good choice!",

Their Sea Salt Caramel milkshake is yummy.  I finished it before I even got my burger.  I got a veggie burger with a gluten free bun.  I felt like giving it a shot even though I love me some beef.  It was delicious although the gluten free bun was a little flimsy. My husband got their mushroom swiss burger and fries which he polished off with no problem.  He would go back anytime and that is saying a lot.  He has high burger standards.  I would recommend it.",

I didn't have to really worry about that around 8:30pm on a Friday though. The outside of the restaurant looks really great and so does the inside. You order at a register and take a seat while you wait for your food. The burger is above average and you can definitely distinguish their burgers from ones that aren't as organic their burger is. The garlic fries are to die for and I suggest getting them. The soda drinks they offer were a little odd but made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. They had diet coke though for those who like that. The people were very friendly and dinner was enjoyable. There are TVs all over the place playing sports so that was a bonus for me.

They have a monthly burger choice that is always packed with variety and typically something that I would never think of combining on a burger.  Hopdoddy has a solid menu with great variety from chicken burgers to spring mix salad (you can add a black bean burger for some extra protein) for vegetarians.  Make it your own by adding, substituting or eliminating all together.  Finally, add some fries to the order and your all set.    Hopdoddy also has some good beers on draft that come in an ice cold mug or if you prefer a mixed drink they have a solid variety to choose from.

High top tables and outdoor seating are a plus  - Experience is casual but can be annoying since you stand in line to order and then they bring it to your table 20 minutes later.  - Happy Hour - go after 9pm for great deals!  Or before 6pm if your schedule permits  - Food - Ahi Tuna burger is delicious!  You can't go wrong with any of the options.  You can get any meat on any of the burgers so there are a ton of options.  If you like spicy - then go for the ones with poblano peppers!  Milk shakes!!! Do it. Unless you're trying to be healthy. Even if you are. Just do it",

Place was packed but the line was never long.  This is food you can't help but gobble.  Had to sneak in a post-Thanksgiving pun, sorry",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am a hamburger snob, and have worked as a cook in fine dining.  With that said, I give Hopdoddy a 3-star \"meh\" rating.  First, we have to stand in line to order, which I'm OK with, really; but then we have a \"server\" that does JUST a bit more than someone at a buffet, so we feel compelled to tip him more than a couple of bucks.  Either earn your tip by being a real server - answering questions, making suggestions and visiting more than once to ask \"how does your food taste?\".  The hamburgers are reasonably priced until you discover they're something you'd get from a kid's menu.  I realize that food prices are high and that rent in Scottsdale ain't cheap, but damn man - this was about the size of a McDonald's double cheeseburger.  Oh, and if you're going to serve \"El Diablo\" it should probably have some zip to it.  The truffle fries didn't taste of truffle at all.  They were cooked well, but that's where the magic ends.  Anyway, I won't choose to go back because I can get a better, sloppier burger from In-N-Out; I don't care that it's not from a cow that had Tasso's La Gerusalemme liberata (13th Century Opera) sung to it.",

So today I decided to do and take out order. It was easy enough online. We get there and sit at the bar to pick up and there is no bartender. We were sitting there for almost 10 minutes. Then there was a guy who went behind the bar and looked at us. Didn't even come up to us and turned his back and started talking with another employee. My boyfriend went up to the counter. At this point the bartender came back. I told her I had an order and she just turned away to go get it. I was going to ask her for some additional sauces, but she walked away to fast. When she came back I asked her for the mushroom sauce and she just turned away before I could ask her for the chipotle sauce to, do she had to walk back and forth twice and waste our time even more. Like I said I love the food, but the service is horrible.",

What he failed to tell us is that the chicken would be in the form of a ground chicken patty.  It was horrible!  We also ordered it without the chickpeas but it was left on there. For $11 or any $, it was a big thumbs down.   We will come back for the burgers for sure. Oh, and if you can make it in between 3-6, they knock off $2 from the burgers.",

There was white, pink, tan, brown, dark brown, specks of black.....no thanks. $40 later and a bunch of no thanks. No thank you, I don't like your food.

    "text": "We really enjoyed our meal at Hopdoddy. The concept was a little confusing when you first walk in as to what to do but once the hostess came to us and explained it we were fine. I ordered the \"El Diablo\" and it was cooked perfectly. It is pretty spicy as a caution but nothing crazy. My wife ordered the Ahi Tuna burger that was also very good aside from using too much wasabi so you may want to ask them to go light. Fries were pretty good and they have a decent beer selection. My one gripe was the beer glasses they use. Kind of look like Margarita glasses and they are very heavy. Overall though we really enjoyed ourselves and will come back.",

They just instituted a new happy hour or as they call it hoppy hour that takes $2 off every burger and $4 drafts/margaritas from 4-6 all week! Baller!i have not had the shakes yet but my mother loved the salted Carmel shake. They always have a new burger and shake on special so to keep it new and exciting. The ingredients are fresh and the butter toasted bun adds to the tastiness. People don't like the ordering it seems from other reviews but I found it easy and convenient.",

The fries are nice and thin so they get super crispy. Try them with the chili cheese dip!! Shakes are the bomb, an absolute must even if you're stuffed. Chocolate stout and red velvet are our favorites. Adult drinks are good too. Love the PV tea!",

    "text": "Well, how many 5 stars have I given to restaurants? Not many. I am very capricious about my 5th star. It takes A LOT for me to wield that 5th star.  I like Hopdoddy's A LOT! Lets face it, this isnt the place to eat 7 or even 5 nights a week. Its too expensive for that and really, its a treat. The burgers are delicious and the milkshakes are amazing! I dont even want to think about how many calories are in those puppies!  Anyway, lets get back to the beginning.  The location is easy to get to off Shea, the parking lot is decent, shared with Chipotle. You walk up and there is free lemon water right at the door so you can help yourself when you are stuck in line. The concept is a hostess gives you a table number while you wait in line to order. You order at the register but pay at the table with your waiter. Then they bring you your food. Maybe they want you to order more food/drinks at your table? No idea. The menu is pretty simple; burgers, fries, drinks. I did notice they do have a couple salad choices. I've never ordered one so I cant speak to that. Since stepping foot in this place the only thing I've ordered is the ahi burger. Omg. Heaven! Its a piece of ahi tuna seared on both sides & red in the middle with yummy stuff in between the buns! The other meat burgers look pretty tasty & juicy as well but I've not tried one of those either. The fries are very flavorful with several options for dipping. They are slim not fat fries but still satisfying. They have a full bar with clearly posted specials for wells & beers. But Ive not tried any of those either. I have the Nutella pretzel milkshake. To DIE for!! Dont bother to get one when you're on a diet. This shake is very rich, creamy, satisfying and tasty! Be wearing your fat pants here girls!! Lets just be honest. The place is very chill with a couple tv screens playing whatever sporting event is on. They have a happy hour from 3:30-6 and the service is very attentive. They have high tables and booths. They use highchairs that hang off the end of the table for the little ones. My kids are 9,7,5 and my little one sits better at a booth than sitting in the tall chairs. The bathroom is usually reasonably clean and we've used it alot. The sodas are all non-GMO so I feel a little better about letting my kids indulge. Once in a while anyway.  So, even tho the prices are def on the higher side for burgers, I feel it is well worth the value for an occasional treat. Others might say its expensive but good things can be. Dont say i didnt warn you about the milkshakes!!",

It's at Hopdoddy, at Hopdoddy  You should read my reviews, to know what I have in mind Craft Brews you oughta know Now you taste so fine, let me order it on the line I wanna go where the milkshakes and the liquors flow  Hopdoddy Burger Bar is also part of the Salty Sow own restaurant cause that's how I got my guitar pick coupon and knew about this place!  They make their own patty and buns here! Dang.......!   I came with a friend and like most diners, you order in line and get a table number.  My friend order the Tuna Ahi Burger while I went with the Primetime, even though my heart was shooting for the Buffalo Bill - I love Bison!  Needless to say my Akaushi Beef burger was an experiment and it was okay for my palate.  I didn't really care for caramelized onions cause it really overpowered my truffle and brie cheese.  I had a hint of arugula and steak sauce.  I was really jealous of my friends Ahi Burger!  One of the best I've tasted with sweet honey wasabi and crunchy sprouts and nori chips....yummy!    Overall, food was awesome-good and the ambiance was perfect for a place to hangout for drinks.  They have many hand crafted specialty drinks plus only locally craft brew beers.  The service is on top of their game here.  Really well informed about their products and treated us with royalty.  That's an A+ in my books! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "That is a fang good veggie burger, YUM! My boyfriend and I were looking for a new place to try last night, and originally decided on Taco Haus..which ended up being closed when we got there. So, looking up places nearby he saw Hopdoddy, which I had really been wanting to try.   One thing that would maybe knock off half a star was we walked in confused, no idea what we were supposed to do because there was no sign or anything! And one lady introduced herself as our server, but like 3 different people were helping us out. Also they sat two of us in a six person spot when it was really busy. It wasn't much of a problem though, just different. The ambiance of Hopdoddy is nice as well, very hip, cool feeling to it.   I ordered La Bandita with no mayo or cheese. It was excellent, the housemade veggie patty was incredible. And a mess. But worth it! Loved the arugula and pesto on it. The bun was fantastic as well. I got fries for my boyfriend and I as well, and they were tasty. I liked that they had different options for sauces, but I stuck mostly with ketchup for my fries. Was WAY to stuffed for a milkshake, but they looked incredible. The truffle fries sounded awesome too.  Usually my boyfriend and I always try a new restaurant whenever we go out for a meal, but we both agreed we will have to be making a return here. We liked it that much!",

Chicken burgers patties go well with beer too!! (Hint as to what the name means. I did get\"hop\" part, down!)   The burgers here are tasty. The beer on tap is \"handcrafted, small batch\" and served in a chilled big daddy goblet. The service is spunky, if not always speedy.   I'm not sure how I found out about Hopdoddy - could have been Doug T. or Mark S. or Ed. D., but I definitely had seen someone check-in and thought, \"looks good!\"   Burger and the way they combine ingredients- 4 stars (I think they should be a bit more meat but taste-wise, they're good though I'm only just working on my \"burger dork\" status ;) Shout out to burger dork! So far: like the \"Goodnight\" but \"El Diablo\" is a close second. You can also BYOB (build your own)  Beers - Five stars - very nice selection of AZ beers - here is where I first found Flag's \"Mother Road's Lost Highway\"   Bar service - Five stars - Kudos to Daniella and the other doll serving us on Sunday night - they were so busy, but took the time to chat and not neglect our group! Great service and so much fun.  Regular service - Three and a half stars - We've had a couple of outstanding servers at tables and one time, not so stellar - quite neglected  Fries - four stars - tasty! (though portioning is a problem - one time, received hardly any. Other times, it was a normal to generous amount on the $2.75 regular)  Shakes - three stars - Salted caramel is \"good\" but I've also tried nutella and the white chocolate one and I'm not a huge fan but the straws are fun!  Other bevs: cool variety of real sugar soda plus mixed drinks and that \"skinny dip\" is sweet (literally!) Their marg mix is too sweet for my taste buds but cool idea.  Seating - Two stars - A host/ess greets, gives you a menu and reserves a table for you, while you wait in line to place your order. Food is delivered and table service ensues though you can go back up for your own condiments or load up prior to sitting down. Seems awkward. Plus, when we ordered additional from table server is when we got gyped on the fries. Seemed to take longer as well. Just not a fan of it.  Overall vibe - five stars - such a fun and friendly place; the indoor space is bright and open and the outdoor patio is welcoming. \"Awesome job!\" to hiring manager - most workers seem genuinely pleasant and very motivated to keep up on the busy days.",

    "text": "Burgers be ballin' at this trendy burger joint. Served on the metal trays reminiscent of ones that can be found inside toaster ovens in lieu of plates, these burgers aren't messing around. There are no garnishes or fancy flowers to distract from the main attraction.  The burger beckons at you to eat it.   Being Valentine's Day, my hubs and I didn't know what to expect. We were relieved to find plenty of parking, but were disenchanted to find such a long line inside. Ah ha! One of those \"walk up to the counter and order\" places. In order to allow for adequate timing of seating, and preventing those annoying seat savers from monopolizing the grounds, your table is assigned conveniently while you're in line. While looking at the menu you're handed while getting in line, you can also order drinks from the bar since it's on the right side. I didn't hesitate to try my Skinny Dip cocktail. Having a mini coronita upsidedown in a large margarita glass filled with frozen alcohol just seemed appropriate when the temps were starting to rise outside.   The Prime time burger was delicious. I couldn't really tell the difference though between the Akaushi beef versus other types of beef. You can't really go wrong with Truffle Aioli, steak sauce, and Brie cheese. The caramelized onions ever so sweetly caressed the beef and Brie. It seemed like a match made in Heaven.   The Diablo seriously packed some punch with some bites that were super spicy. My hubby said that it was one of the spiciest burgers that he's ever had and he the type to enter spicy food eating competitions and win them. He did go on to say that although it was super spicy, he loved it because he felt that it was \"just right.\" He always complains that other places claim that a menu item is spicy and doesn't pull through. From his words, you can count on this one to taunt your taste for burn and flavor simultaneously.   We shared the truffle fries, but although very flavorful, they weren't quite \"truffly\" as one would expect. I guess that was good though, because the side didn't over power the burgers we had. I also plan to order the red velvet shake next time because that just sounds awesome doesn't it? My vote is that they add alcoholic shakes to their menu too because that would be phenomenal!",

It is next to impossible to find a \"server\" to take a payment. Go back to the way it was when you opened. You stand in line, order your food, pay the bill and be done.  If possible, sit at the bar as the bartender is always there for you and service is much better. I have been to Hopdoddy twice in the last week and it appears the staff is really slacking. Tonight my husband and I watched while 7 burgers sat on the shelf waiting for delivery for well over 5 minutes and 4 employees were standing together at the order counter laughing it up.  The place was busy!   I have asked two employees why the payment system was changed and this was their answer:  1). People didn't leave tips in the jar because they paid with credit card. Most people will leave a tip on their credit card receipt when paying after their meal. My response to that-I stood in line, ordered my burger, got my own drink, fetched my own ketchup, and one person brought my hamburger from the shelf to my table. No tip earned.  2). By not paying until after eating this gives you the opportunity to order more fries and alcohol and have it on one bill. My response to that-If I am unable to locate a \"server\" how and why would I want more fries and  another alcoholic drink?  So, go back to payment at order, and have the staff get their act together like it was when you first opened.  Your burgers are great!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Hopdoddy for a while now, but never seemed to have the time. When I finally did, and after some good words by a fellow Yelper, I found myself driving there pronto. I arrived with my husband in tow around 7:30pm on a Tuesday evening. I had heard how a line will form outside, but we were lucky and there wasn't a line or a long wait. An employee (hostess?) opened the door for us and we asked about making a to-go order. She told us to sit at the bar, as that would be faster than waiting in line. Luckily, there was open space at the bar and we sidled up to look at the menu. The bartender was extremely nice, helpful, and friendly. He was very accommodating when we told him we had a to-go order.   We ordered The Classic and the Llano Poblano with a side of parmesan fries. The shake of the day was Tiramisu and sounded yummy, so we ordered one of those as well. Our shake was ready before our food, so we tucked in with two large straws. Mmm, it was really thick and creamy. I really enjoyed the espresso flavor but the crumbled up lady fingers were a little on the crunchy side. By the time we finished our shake, our food was ready and we were on our way.  We took the burgers home and dug in. The hamburger was extremely tender and perfectly cooked at medium. I really enjoyed how flavorful it was and can't wait to go back and try the mushroom burger. The parmesan fries, which the bartender raved about, where meh. The fries themselves were good, but the addition of parmesan and the side of special parmesan sauce wasn't worth $6.50. (The regular fries were $2.75! Definitely a better deal.) The burgers were relatively inexpensive as well, around $7-9 (depending on extras/add-ons).   Overall, I am very impressed and think I have found a new favorite burger place. I have been craving Hopdoddy all week and can't wait to go back!",

Both times the restaurant was full which is a great sign!   Ok ok get to the important stuff, I get it! Jeeze!   Tonight's order was the Buffalo Bill (which had blue cheese, sassy sauce, hot sauce and bacon). It was delicious! It was suppose to come out medium-rare and it came out well done but it was still tasty and delicious. It had the perfect amount of the Good kind of blue cheese too!!!!   My hubs ordered the classic burger and added bacon and cheddar. His was cooked perfectly which made me a teensy bit jealous...  We shared fries....**YUUUUUMMMM** I love the soda selection with the real cane brand or whatever it's called and oh the Vanilla milkshake .......**droooooool**   But really, this place is delicious. Zero complaints. Awesome staff, great atmosphere, yummy and quick to table food.  *cheers*",

Saw at least a dozen groups come after us stand around for 5 mins or so and just leave.  Anyways, we eventually ordered our burgers and fries and got to our table.  Half our order showed up after another almost half hour wait, luckily it was the kids food.  5 or 10mins pass and my wife and I asked about ours, they said if should be right out.  Another 20 mins later we flag another server who can see we're clearly getting annoyed.  She apologizes goes over what's missing and will see it gets rectified right away.  Another 15mins goes by and we've had enough and just want to leave.  I go back to speak to someone who clearly recognizes me and knows our table number and says they'll get the manager (Josh).  Another wait while they try and track him down.  When he finally comes out he's just short and says he'll refund the meal... He's certainly not a people person.  Wasn't about to wait for them to try and make our burgers a third time and wasn't interested in anything for next time as there will be no next time.  Too bad was once pretty great.",

    "text": "Good burgers, locally grown foods, great service and strong drinks. Isn't that all you really need to know when it comes to a burger bar? You want the facts.  Plain and simple.    My recommendation is that you let yourself branch out here and go wild with a burger you think you wouldn't normally order. Ask for the sauce you think you wouldn't like to be put on the side so you can give it a go but not have to worry about it being all over your burger if you don't end up liking it. They have a lot of options here and you'll need to go back a few times to really get a feel for what will become your \"usual\" but that's the fun part about a burger bar, right!?  The fries are a perfect option for sharing between two or three people - I wouldn't try to share with more, you may end up ending relationships over an order of fries and who wants that.  So, if you love this place so much, why four stars instead of five you ask? Well. I have to agree with the other reviewer that said that the logistics of navigating this place can be a touch confusing on your first go. If it's really busy you'll wait outside, to get a chance to wait inside.  Then you'll get someone that'll walk up to you and hand you a number to give to the cashier when you finally get up there. You'll order and they'll tell you to find that randomly assigned table number somewhere in the restaurant...so now you get to wonder around a bit to find your table.    Once all that is over though, you'll have good eats and now you'll know how things work next go round and be ready for the shenanigans.",

With that said I would have never visited this restaurant if it was my choice, just not really interested in gourmet burgers I would rather go to Carls Jr to get a Double western. The best burger ever!  Even though my favorite hamburger comes from a fast food restaurant I still know a good burger when I taste one.   This place blew me out of the water I had the Bison burger (They have a very specific name for it) protein style. Man this burger was crazy good I cant wait to go back and pay WHATEVER for there burgers making my way through there menu.  Oh yeah service was GREAT from the cashier to the waiter to everyone we passed all friendly and helpful.",

I understand management has changed and people come and go so consistency isn't always there but the quality shouldn't have to suffer. Buns were soggy, the burger came out barely warm, the lettuce and some toppings were wet and literally left a water puddle under the burger. They def have made some beneficial changes like the way tables are tagged and payment at the table instead of at the reg. But the food quality isn't the same :/  Hope to see this place improve!

I opted for a beef patty instead. It was cooked perfectly. However, the flavors didn't really stick out. It was just bland. I also ordered the Green Chili Queso fries, with the queso on the side. I guess they normally pour it on to the fries. I have always had it on the side at other locations. Not sure if pouring the queso on the fries is new. But anyway, the queso solidified fairly quickly to where I could no longer dip my fries. Could only imagine what my fries would be like if they poured the queso on. Hopefully this isn't standard at other locations. Guess it was just an off night.",

Ordered a couple burgers, a beer and their honey & sage sweet potato fries.  I personally liked the size of the burgers.  Not outrageously large as some places make. A nice sized brioche style bun with a perfectly cooked burger - lightly pink in the middle.  The sauce was great with nice greens and a \"red\" tomato.  Hate when you get a tomato that is barely orange with a big white core in the middle.  This was not that:)  But, let me tell you about the fries...I'm going to say they are insanely good.  Ok, if you're not a sweet fan, the honey may put you over the top, but for me, it was balanced and amazingly delish!  Crispy as they should be and with a dip into some spicy aioli to contrast the sweet - absolutely scrumptious!  And if you're not a fan of that combo, they have many alternatives that also sounded amazing.  In addition, although you walk up to order your food/drink at the counter, there is a nice wait staff that comes around to your table to make sure you have all that you need, and are there to please.  I'm definitely keeping them this place my list!",

    "text": "First time here and I have to say they serve an amazing burger.  I have a go-to burger place at a local Scottsdale tavern and I thought their burger was good, but Hopdoddy blows them out of the water!  You have to get on line to order and they bring the food to your table.  If this is your first time, you wouldn't know how they operate.  You might stand by the door waiting to be seated when in actuality you have to walk toward the front where there is a cashier and order your meal.  The sign giving these instructions are two steps before you reach the cashier!   Ever think of putting the ordering instructions by the door!????    I ordered the plain old burger with a slice of Cheddar cheese while my dining companion ordered the Diablo (lot of jalapenos and even Habaneros).  They will customize anything just ask.  We ordered a small order of fries which turned out to be enough for two.  They were well done as we asked.  They have lots of sauces you can put on your food even one with truffles.  We also ordered a small salad which was enough or two which had very good greens and heirloom type cherry tomatoes.  It was a good salad and the green goddess dressing was quite nice as well.  My major turn off was $7 for a glass of beer which was about 8 ounces   and the first inch of the glass was the head.  Not a good buy AT ALL.  I like a beer with my burger but I don't appreciate abusive pricing.  I didn't even bother to ask what the price of the beer was because I didn't think it would be more than $5 at most for such a small beer.   The staff was super, super friendly and accommodating.  Any thing you ask, they answer; anything you want, they get it.   Fantastic staff. As I looked around and saw that most of their booths are elevated, I wondered how a person with disabilities would be able to enjoy a burger at Hopdoddy.  Is it wheelchair accessible?",

We ordered the impossible protein style, the el Diablo, the Hopdoddy ipa and Parmesan fries. The impossible burger was delicious and I thought really well done considering it's a meat substitute. The el Diablo was also good but the Parmesan fries were really awesome. The servers walking by were friendly and helpful. They have a nice variety of hot sauces however, they had a generic version of siraracha which is made in China instead of Cali which I didn't care for.   Bottom line..great place for a burger with many different options. Has a fun hipsterish vibe.   Pros Impossible burger is great  Parmesan fries is the best  Service is good   Cons The off brand sriracha was not great!",

This time around, I decided to give this place a try. Let me tell you... I wasn't disappointed not one bit!  My husband and I decided to come here on a Friday night. It was pretty busy but we had our order taken quickly and efficiently. The staff is wonderful and so friendly!  I ordered the 'Poblano' burger and it was the juiciest burger I have ever had. Every thought process that was taken to perfect this burger showed in every bite I had. The buns were extra soft yet supported the rest of the ingredients to perfection! The peppers were perfectly cooked (not soggy) and left a great crunch with every enjoyable bite. Also, as a side order we got the parmesan truffle fries. OH MY! Those were to die for!!! They were served with a black truffle butter on the side which complimented the fries to perfection.  The way it works is you order at the counter and they give you a number and a table. The serve the food to you and you are greeted with wonderful staff members that make sure you have a delightful experience.   I will definitely be back here in the near future!",

We both were craving a cheeseburger and have not had the best experience with a few local places that are supposed to be the best. I'd been to Hopdoddy before with a friend from work and thought it deserved another shot. As soon as we walked in the door (11 am sharp) there were sooo many people funneling in behind us, grabbing a menu and pondering a seat choice. Here, you order at the counter and are assigned a table- inside or outside and a server brings your food and drinks to you. My son and I sat outside! Music is good, and the place is really hoppin. No joke. Families- Couples- Kids and Parents! This place is great for every age group. I had a beer  with a cheeseburger with aioli, blue cheese, lettuce, onions, tomato. Make sure if you want your burger cooked a certain way, you specify. For me- medium is a little too pink. It was really the best cheeseburger I have had in a long time. You can customize to your liking! Do NOT forget the fries- with sauce.... seriously yum.  They have promotion nights or do this Thursday so, I'll be taking the fam. back. Love this place because it's the perfect atmosphere to just catch up and people watch. Oh- service was also exceptional- speedy and we were checked on often!!",

The Bananas Foster shake... omg... too good. The Strawberry Shortbread shake... if you are from the country this will make you think of home. The Malted Rootbeer was great ... makes me want Whoppers now. Lol",

I will really think about going next time only because you shouldn't have to wait this long to eat a burger!",

I was super happy to read that they support local farms, grind their own meat and bake their own bread! Ordered the Goodnight burger with a bison patty, no cheese, sauce on the side and a small fry. They usually offer gluten free buns but they were out tonight so I went with a lettuce wrap instead.  The bison was so juicy and cooked perfectly, the caffeinated bbq sauce had a delicious kick and the fries were just the right amount of crispy! I was satisfied. Fun atmosphere with upbeat music and a full bar. Highly recommend for a local burger restaurant!",

DoorDash merely picked it up but you guys filled the order so it's on you.   No bun, how am I supposed to eat it.  Cooked raw - not medium or even rare just raw.  No napkin, no condiments, no silverware  Seriously, do you quality check a simple order in one bag.  I even double checked the order to ensure I didn't make a mistake and I didn't. 22 dollar order, I got a 7 dollar refund and no dinner.  Fucking fantastic.",

    "text": "Some might skip to my Lou, but I want to hop to my doddy!  Mmm the Impossible Burger. Science's middle finger to the anti-GMO movement. How else can you get a plant based burger that actually bleeds like animal meat would when you cook it? It's a delicious scientific monstrosity! I'm personally all for this frankenburger.   So I've been craving an Impossible Burger ever since finding out they got their long awaited FDA approval for their plant based heme, the key ingredient that makes this burger taste like meat. I've only had it one other time, at Traci de Jardin's Jardiniere in San Francisco. It was absolutely delicious when I had it there so I was excited to hear that restaurants in AZ were offering them.   When we stepped inside the friendly gentleman at the front gave us an explanation of how to order, but my mind was in an \"In one ear and out the other\" kind of day. Maybe it's because there were visions of Impossible burgers dancing through my head (Forget all that nonsense about visions of sugarplums). I kind of got the gist that it was an order at the counter type place. He gave us the table number we were to sit at, so we sat, then were confused. There was no sign near the kitchen telling us where to order, the ordering station looked kind of hidden and was in a narrow walkway that the servers also used a lot. Luckily our server sensed our confusion and got some menus out for us and we were eventually able to see the cashier register from where we were sitting.   In addition to the Impossible burger, I shared some green chile queso fries. We requested the fries come out first and it was only a few short minutes before they were ready. My first thought when I saw my fries was \"Did they not plate my fries at all? Looks like they just used the prep bowl they mix the seasoning in.\" Turns out that's exactly what they did, looking at the presentation of other customer's fries on Yelp. Way to phone it in guys lol. I'm surprised they didn't just dump it on our table still dripping with oil in the fry basket it was cooked in. The fries tasted good at least and I liked the green chile queso it was served with. Something about the laziness of how they presented the fries irked me. Maybe it's because I just paid $7 for this. If I'm paying a premium for a certain item I feel like it should look like they put premium care into making and presenting it. Serving it in the large prep bowl also made it look like the serving size was not that big since the bowl dwarfed the pile of fries sitting in it.  The Impossible burger was really good! The \"meat\" patty was cooked to about medium well but the burger was still really tender and soft in texture. The patty was grilled to perfection with a lovely crispy outer layer. I took a bite of a classic burger with bacon and cheese and actually preferred my Impossible burger over the burger with two types of real meat!  Another plus of this restaurant is that they have a Maine Root soda fountain. I washed everything down with some delicious blueberry soda and diet cola. Good stuff!  Now that I know where and how to order, I'll definitely be back for more Impossibly good burgers!",

Just when you think the whole gourmet burger thing is overplayed, which it isn't, but in case you thought that, a place like this comes around and reminds you why America fell in love with the ground beef/bun combo all those years ago. Hopdoddy's offers a unique selection of burgers that don't stray too far from the classic formula, but far enough to make your taste buds sit up and take note. I was about to list some of my favorites, but they are really all so scrumptious that it's hard to single out just a few items, but take my word for it - the burgers rule.  As if that weren't enough, Hoppy D's (what I'm calling it now) also has amazing fries (regular and truffle - dear god, those truffle fries) and homemade sauces for your dipping pleasure.  But wait there's more. They also make milkshakes. Delicious, heavenly milkshakes that will make you wonder what you were drinking before when you thought you were drinking a milkshake.  But wait...THERE'S MORE!!! Yup, they serve beer. On tap. Local. WHAT?! Crazy I know. Don't believe me? Go check it out for yourself. Tasting is believing.",

I have been looking for a new, really good, burger joint for a while and this is definitely on the top of my list. Their menu is simple yet still has plenty of delicious choices. I ordered the \"Goodnight\" burger with a side of fries, and it was so delicious I immediately wanted another one. The burger was cooked perfectly, every topping and condiment was just the right amount to add to the flavor, but not overpower it, and the bun that held it all together was just as delicious. Every burger is customizable with many options to fine tune its taste to your unique taste buds. Even their fries are delicious, made with kennebec potatoes, which gives them a very unique flavor. Even though I heard these type of fries are referred to as \"hipster fries\", I still find them delicious. ;-)  The overall atmosphere is very modern and laid back, it is definitely a place to visit for lunch, dinner, and even happy hour. They had a great selection of craft beers and yummy looking cocktails. They also make their own soda and their shakes that look amazingly delicious.  I am very happy I came across this place and look forward to many more future check-ins.",

    "text": "I am not sure what all of the hype is about this restaurant, but my experience was not so pleasant. I hate to post negative reviews, and I only do when a restaurant can be spectacular and miss the mark by miles.   I came in for lunch with my brother and sat at the bar. I was pretty specific about the order and it seemed the kitchen did not understand the assignment. I ordered the Greek burger, on wheat, hold the arugula and add romaine lettuce. Meal comes out on the egg bun, no lettuce. It was taken back to have romain added, and replace the bun, and instead of romain (which I know they have because they serve Caesar salads) it comes out with red limp lettuce. Upon taking a bite of the burger, I see that the inside is completely underdone. Obviously at this point, I'm over it.   The restaurant had more staff than patrons, so I'm unsure how details are overlooked. The bartender was nice, however she did not write anything down and lacked the ability to remember and had to ask three times what the specifics were.   My brother also had a burger, the traditional one with only ketchup and mustard. Apparently it was too much of a chore to put it on the burger and it came out plain.   I wanted a burger so bad this day and normally I go to Habit Burger, and their burgers are perfect, always consistent, perfect service, hot meat and cheese, super cold veggies and no matter what I change, they always get it right. It is probably half the cost also. I chose to try something new and my level of disappointment could not be greater.   The build out was nice, but the food was unable to match the decor. I am sure the concept is good. I heard who the owning partners are, and they always have great restaurants, so I am a bit shocked I was so disappointed.   Typically in the establishments I dine in, when there is a disappointed customer, some form of management comes out to ask about the experience, get details so they can address the kitchen appropriately. Not one person came out to inquire.   Word of advice, management should always come out and find out what happen so this can be rectified. Second, if you are going to call yourself a Burger Bar, and offer all of the options shown on the menu, the kitchen should be able to understand and prepare the order, as if they ordered it, and a temperature should always be requested.",

As for the milkshakes, I've only tried 2 so far: Nutella with chocolate covered pretzels is amazeballs and the caramel with sea salt just tasted like a vanilla shake with caramel in it. Meh.  I really like that they offer different types of sodas than you're used to seeing, all made with real sugar. Even the ketchup is made with real sugar!  Next time, I'm going for the Llano Poblano burger with roasted poblanos, pepper jack, and chipotle mayo and the Oreo shake! Yes, please!",

    "text": "The burgers vary greatly but they're so delicious.  I never would have thought I would like a mushroom burger.  And no way am I gonna like a chicken burger.    Well I was proven wrong.  The mushroom burger was my absolute favorite followed closely by the Ahi burger and the Continental (chicken).  The beef hamburger didnt seem nearly as appealing to my palate as the mushroom or Ahi tuna burgers. French fries with a truffle aoli will give you a new found appreciation (truth here -it could be love) for French fries.    Salads are delicious, fresh, combinations of the season.   The taste of summer watermelon in a salad of baby kale.  Fantastic. Sodas from Maine that are made with pure can sugar and natural favors instead of a lot of dyes and chemicals.  Kinda makes you feel like a kid again.  BTW, i hear the blueberry soda ( yeah, bet you've never heard of that before) actually tasted like real blueberries.   And then there are some special cocktails and deliciously tempting shakes that are unique to this place too.   And the service is impressive.  The staff is knowledgeable of the menu items including the ingredients of each.   Food is delicious and different.  Service is polite, knowledgeable,  and efficient. AND prices are comparable to places like Fuddruckers. I'm already planning to bring my family here.",

The long line snakes around the front is like waiting for a ride at Disney...and moves just as slowly. I just couldn't figure out why.  You are funneled past the bar so you can order your drinks while shuffling towards burger heaven. If they cleaned and bussed the tables promptly maybe that would speed things up a bit. The waitress assigned seating system is confusing the first time but seems to work.  Definitely a great burger, in a fun atmosphere. The biggest drawback? The machine they use to make the handmade shakes sounds like a dentist drill...and its running 95% of the time! Its right by the ordering counter so gets louder and louder as you (slowly) approach. Makes my teeth ache just thinking about it LOL",

Both were delicious. The beef is hormone/antibiotic free. The burgers are made with fresh ingredients and are full of flavour. The buns are baked on site. Overall a great burger experience. Our kids ordered the classic and split it- but didn't finish their burgers. They are picky eaters so we didn't expect these gourmet burgers to be a hit with them. At least it was happy hour (before 6pm on monday) so their burger and fries and drink was about $9. We also ordered the truffle parm fries. So good but too much to finish.",

Hopdoddy absolutely makes the cut out here in AZ! Perfectly cooked burgers, buns that don't take over the burger, great taste, delicious truffle fries, and awesome milkshakes (red velvet was our choice).    The space works well.  You first build your burger, then find a table and it will be served to you. We went on a Friday night and arrived a little early since we had kids in tow, shortly after we were seated there was a line out the door. Be prepared for a bit of a line, but it seemed to move quickly.    A must try spot if you are in search of a great burger!",

They must be \"line out the door busy\" at times (thankfully today wasn't one of those days) because they had misters and lemon-water for people waiting outside. It's a unique concept that you get assigned a table before ordering your food...so you order your food then come back and sit at your table. then a server brings your food out.   I ordered the El Diablo burger which was really good and fulfilling with fries. Had a spicy kick to it (didn't really like the onions tho). The only thing i was confused on was are you suppose to tip the workers that are walking around assisting guests? they bring you w/e you need and even refill your drink for you. the sodas are cool too, they aren't your normal coke or pepsi, it's like mexican cola or sugar cane ginger ale, something different.  I will def try the place again...one Con of this place is that it's very pricey! A burger, drink, and fries will set you back $15!",

    "text": "I really don't understand why this place has gotten so many stars. Its a weird setup. First, you go in, and stand in line (McDonalds style) to order a burger and drinks. Wait staff are shuffling next to you and jostling to get by. You're standing in line being jostled on one side and have a loud kitchen in the other.  You pay for your food. You sit and wait. The burgers weren't great. The meat was gummy and had the feel of biting into some gelatinous gooey meat like substance. Not a burger. The hubs had a super salty veggie burger and my kid had a grilled cheese that was basically a hamburger bun turned inside out and buttered within an inch if it's life and pan fried. It was greasy and gross and she smeared buttery handprints on every surface she could touch (She's two - she can't help it. I cleaned up before we left with a wipe, but even for a toddler, it was a gross amount of grease.) The saving grace of the meal was the truffle fries, but I'm kind of partial to truffle oil and can eat that with a spoon, so maybe I'm not a good judge. We ordered a shake to round out our meal and had to pull out our credit card a second time during the meal to pay for it. (WHY don't they just have you order all your food at the table like a normal restaurant so you don't have the hassle of paying multiple times for one meal? I mean, you have the wait staff... They did take an order at my table...) It's a stupid setup. The place is too loud. The food is below average (I like to only give one star to restaurants that ultimately give me the trots, and at least they didn't give me food poisoning). And it's not kid friendly. Save your money and go pick up some burgers at In N Out and rent a movie at home. The experience and the food would be far better. (Yes, I called a fast food burger better...) I would judge this place \"Not worth the calories and the drive.\"",

We had never been here before and were a little thrown off by the \"order at the counter\" idea when the place looked like a typical restaurant.  We went to our booth to look over the menu and our waiter came over to tell us we could go ahead and just order with him whenever we were ready.  So apparently you can do it either way.  Throughout our meal, we had about 4 or 5 different people come and check on us (plus our waiter checked on us many times).  I thought this was nice because they seemed over-staffed and had a group of waitresses (or hostesses) hanging out at the front chatting but they kept breaking off one by one to go make rounds and check on customers all throughout the restaurant.  I highly recommend all of the following: Black Cherry Hard Limeade, Green Eggs & Ham Burger (special burger that I hope makes it on the permanent menu), Green Chili Queso, and Caramel & Sea Salt Shake.  Shockingly good prices for such amazing food, good atmosphere, and good customer service!",

Then u sit and if u order anything else, you have to pay again.  People tend to order more beers after their initial order you know... Then while we r eating, we notice the line grow to around the building. Huh? The food is simply average for a high end burger joint, so why would anyone wait an hour standing in a line for it.  This place will either go to a regular sit down format or fail miserably.  Considering indulge burger failed just up the street, and their food was better, I see major fail here.",

When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted, given a menu, and told what table you will be at. You then get in line and place your order. We had the classic Cheeseburger which comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and a sassy sauce which I had on the side. It is a ketchup, horseradish sauce and honey mustard. The honey mustard flavor is over powering so I am glad i got it on the side. The regular fries are tasty, crisp and not greasy. The bun on the burger is a brioche bun. The burger was cooked just the way I ordered it. My only objection is that I had a gift card which I tried to use but there was a problem with their system and I could not use it until they check into the problem. I was later told by a worker there that hey have had a number of problems with the gift cards. Someone needs to work on that. They have a greek burger with Lamb, Feta, onions, various other burgers and salads.",

We noticed that there was provision for a long line and ice water outside, as well as a notice that tables were reserved for those in the line, so we imagined that it could be crowded, but not at 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon!  We both tried local brews, which we later learned were not included in the Hoppy Hour prices, but that was okay.  Served in an icy footed goblet, my wife tried the San Tan Epicenter and I wanted to taste the Phoenix Ale Watermelon, which neither of us felt had a fruity taste, so it was fine too.  My wife went for the Llano Poblano Burger, which she pronounced a winner and muy delicioso, and I was attracted to the Goodnight Burger because $1 of the price went to a local charity--plus it had fresh jalapenos on it!  Both were outstanding and almost too juicy!  We shared a large order of truffle Kennebec fries, and they were so good by themselves that we didn't use the accompanying sauce because they were perfect as is.  A really cute place, service was great, and next time I want to try one of their renowned milk shakes (like raspeberry white chocolate cheesecake or Nutella!)  We will be here again next year!

My daughter and I shared the Primetime, the Goodnight and parmesan truffle fries. Both burgers were cooked as ordered - medium rare - and were flavorful and \"messy juicy\". The fries were to die for...she was even digging to the bottom of the paper cone to get all the goodness that had settled there! We also both had the cream soda...a great change from the usual soft drink offerings. Definitely putting Hopdoddy into our lunch rotation.",

It is a little confusing and frustrating to have multiple bills from various sections of the restaurant, but it always seems to run seemlessly.   The burgers are really delicious. I have since gone vegetarian and have their black bean patty instead. It's good, but not the best I've had. It does have beets in the patty, so it is more on the purple side, which is interesting. I do, however, miss being a meat eater everytime I go here. The fries are delicious and I love their chipotle ketchup. I've heard from my gluten free friends that they have the best gluten free bun.   I tend to go during lunch or early dinner hours because this place does get packed for dinner. I went one Saturday night and did the waiting in line thing. If you have the time and patience for that, then go for it. I usually have plans after dinner and don't want to chance being late.",

My other half ordered it with grass fed beef (you have to request it. $3 more but so good!!) It has ghost peppers, serranos, jalapeno,  habaneros and ghost pepper sauce. He had to sign a waiver before they brought it to him. People around us engaged in conversation about his choice. (Others ordered it and took the challenge as well. No one fell off their bar stools) He bit into it and was raving that it was probably the best burger he's ever had. I had a bite and it was great! If I can handle the heat level, so can you! I had the chicken sandwich with avocado and poblanos. The chicken was moist and the best chicken sandwich I've ever tasted (all the others have been dry)  the fries are hot and perfectly seasoned. Not a fan of the truffle fries, but the regular ones rock! Our service at the bar has always been a good experience. Even when they were packed last night, Jesse never missed a beat! Try it at least once...if you like spicy and the ghost burger is gone, try the Diablo. A big favorite there.",

    "text": "I started a Yelp account, because I was so impressed by this place. I am so excited Hopdoddy decided to come to the neighborhood. I will break down the highlights.  The atmosphere: This place felt like a modern diner. The lighting and music is just right and the positive energy from the staff spreads throughout. It doesn't feel too fancy or too cheap. It is just right.   The staff: We walked up and saw there was a line. Initially, it put us off a bit, but the guy at the door was so nice and helpful. The fact they had a person to guide us made their unique dining concept more accommodating. They even had someone serving drinks to the line. Lines are more fun with a cocktail. Once, we got inside we walked by the bar and the bartender told us we could sit at the bar and receive full service. Best decision EVER! The bartenders were amazing. Addison and Jessica provided us with recommendations, fast service, and fun conversation. While at the bar we noticed Addison knew several other patrons by name. The fact this place already has regular clientele speaks volumes. I highly recommend sitting at the bar, but every staff member we encountered were genuinely nice and eager.  The food: WOW! Two words truffle fries. These fries were crisp, flavorful, and unique and best of all served with a truffle aioli. I ordered the Goodnight and my husband the Primetime. Both were made perfectly. The best part is they are reasonably priced and so are the drinks. A huge frosted mug of crafted Arizona beer for $5! It is nice to have a place in Scottsdale with quality food that is actually affordable.   The process: We didn't get the experience of ordering at the counter, but the bartenders explained it to us. You are assigned a table # from the hostess then you order at the counter. After that you find your table and from that point on you don't have to get up again. You have a server for drinks, more food, and anything else you need. I admit it sounded odd, but it somehow seems to work.   The Cons: I was too full for a milkshake, but we will be back.   If you like burgers or beer. I highly recommend Hopdoddy.",

I went with my kids (cause yelp says it's kid friendly!), and when I asked if they had burgers for kids, the lady at the register told me they could do grilled cheese or order the classic burger with just the patty (it comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato etc). Same size burger as the adult burger, same price, just 50% less stuff. Hmmmmm. Not asking to reinvent the wheel here, just saying. I looked around on a Saturday afternoon and there were a good amount of kids.  Overall the burgers were good. Obviously I ate a lot of left overs from my kids. (I hate throwing good food away.....) I had the Caesar salad (not necessarily low cal) with grass fed beef. It was delicious. Truffle fries were on par with the regular fries if you ask me. They only come in one size (large).....  It's a bit confusing walking in, where do you order, can't read the menu properly, wait, how do we get a table. But besides that-Def will come again. The burgers are great.",

Second time was sub par, the poblano burger was great but lacked a little something, the truffle fries were terrible and the same shake was super runny. Thought it might be a fluke so we went there again yesterday. Just ordered the shake and it was again super runny. Everyone else liked their burgers but the fries left something to be desired. I hope they figure out the whole shake bit and get something rolling with their fries.",

The decor gives you that \"we're fresh from the farm but very modern\" kind of vibe. A great place for aesthetic pictures.   Their seasoned fries are to die for! It's a large portion, so I'd only get them if it was 3+ in the party. Everything you buy there is basically al a carte (they charge extra for cheese on the burger).

    "text": "I knew going in, the ordering system might be a little bit of a C.F., but it actually wasn't too bad.  There was a friendly young woman by the entrance guiding the flow of traffic and she gave us a menu and pointed us toward the register.  We were there around noon on a Saturday.  We ordered with no problems and I suffered from mild sticker shock, but nothing obscene.  Two burgers, the truffle fries, and 2 beers were $39.67 before tip.  We shared the Thunderbird chicken sandwich, the truffle fries, and the Magic Shroom burger plus bacon (of course).  Mr. M had a Oak Creek Nut Brown and I tried Four Peaks' Peach ale.    When I ordered my sandwich I knew it had poblano peppers and chipotle mayo on it and thought for a split second that it might be a little too spicy for my taste, but actually, it had very little flavor at all.  Kind of shocking.  The grilled chicken breast was good quality and moist, but that sandwich was completely bland.  The truffle fries were just ok.  They were soaked with the oil, soggy, and not really that appealing.  Mr. M's shroom burger was the real winner.  The blend of flavors of good quality beef, mushrooms, bacon, and pesto was perfect!  I would definitely get that again.    Service overall was really top notch and everyone was very friendly.  Our server Riley had several tables and she was hustling and smiling the whole time.  I didn't care for the techno music and all the rabid children.  When we were finished we asked ourselves if we would come back and we both said maybe.    If I were to return I'd definitely just sit at the bar and for sure get the shroom burger again.  I read that happy hour pricing is pretty good too, so if I do return and have a better experience I'll be sure to update my review, but for now it's just A-OK to us.",

We were given the quick tour of how the place works and were able to get one of the last remaining tables.  I ordered the Ahi tuna burger and the truffle fries.  I thought the tuna was done perfect but many folks would have say it was a bit too well done and my friend said it looked so rare she would not have touched it. She had a cheese burger, very well done, and fries and she liked it.  A word on the truffle fries, they were very good but the order is large enough they need to be shared.  I took over half the order home with me.  Every body on the staff we dealt with was friendly and knowledgeable.  They really fill up for a weekday lunch but it did not hurt the service quality or timing.",

As a business owner I recognize it when employees own there positions and represent the companies they work for as if it is there own. I hope management recognize this gentleman with some sort of profit sharing or a salary increase to say the least. It was the first time I've ever been here and I was treated like an king. Owen explained the menu like he owned the place as well as explained the Hopdoddy fresh ingredient and top notch beef selections and processes.  And then the burger itself!!!! It was delicious!!! They only problem was I was stuffed and just wanted another burger! Definitely going back and have already started telling friends, family and now you the world.",

My party consisted of some picky eaters, my oldest daughter her 16 month old son, and my son. 1st question my son has is how do I even know where this place is at, I just answered him one does not ask these things of mom's just know I know things haha.  We walked in and checked out the menu and ordered where placed.  Daughter went with The Classic Burger plain just beef, cheese, BACON pls cooked well, that's how she rolls  Son ordered The Goodnight burger: Angus beef, cooked med rare, with Tillamook cheddar cheese, hickory bbq sauce, caramelized onions slices & jalapeno & sassy sauce, and that burger didn't last long at all, poof it was gone  After some flip flopping on what to pick I settled with the Thunderbird, it's organic chicken burger with roasted poblano chili, cheese, BACON and avocado, it's amazing with the perfect amount of heat!  Also for kicks we ordered Kennebec fries & Truffle fries, my son loved the truffle fries, said he felt fancy eating them, I enjoyed them as well!  Almost went home without a shake, but nope we ordered a few before we left, I went with the Caramel & Sea Salt Shake, this is the perfect combo of a salty sweet and great treat on a hot June night, my son went with the raspberry white chocolate and I guess it was good, he wouldn't share haha.   The El Diablo is calling me so I know I will be back soon.",

Shortly after however, a relatively large line started to form.  The beer selection is really good for a burger joint and they offer healthy options with their fountain drinks. They offer a variety of burgers, which all sounded delicious on the menu. When you first order, the cashier will warn you of the temperature in which the burgers come (med-rare to med). Unfortunately, our Buffalo Bill and El Diablo burgers came pretty well done. The saving grace of the meal? Fries. Nom. The freshly cut fries with truffle aioli were absolutely divine. They even offer a chipotle ketchup out of a dispenser that compliments the fries pretty well.  Decent experience overall and worth a try if you are craving a burger. Definitely get the fries - you will not regret it.",

You get $2 off burgers and I think there were drink specials too. When we were there, the hostess will give you a table number. There was a pretty long line that wrapped along the bar... pretty sneaky and genius all at the same time!! The bartender takes your drink orders first and then the cashier takes your food order.   I had the Lil Prick Martini... it was delicious. It was refreshing and light, not too sweet and not too  tangy. I forget what Mike got but it wasn't bad either. We shared the Buffalo Bill burger (add fried egg minus the onions) and an order of the Parmesan Truffle fries. I really liked the bison burger but they did forget to take off the onion, no biggie. The truffle fries are okay, I've had better.  The staff was friendly and attentive. They cleared out our plates and brought out more drinks quickly. Definitely a pretty nice place to meet with a big group of people.",

Parking is right in the front and super convenient. We walked in and were a bit confused but then realized that we had to order and then the servers would bring the food to our table. I ordered the la bandita and my friend ordered the classic burger. The la bandita was delicious! It was a black bean burger with corn, goat cheese and avocado. It was honestly super healthy and very filling with a good mix of flavors. My friend's classic burger looked pretty good too. We also ordered truffle fries to share (which was so good & truffly) and each of us got a beer which was served in a nice, big and cold goblet.   We decided to sit outside and the nice part about the restaurant is that they bring everything to you and all you have to do is order. The other beneficial part is that you can keep ordering beer or food, keep your tab open and pay your bill at the end. The atmosphere was pretty chill and we were sitting and enjoying the weather with our beer after our filling meal.   Overall, good food, service and experience. I am looking forward to coming back to try some of their other burgers.",

Chicken, beef, turkey, buffalo, veggie, etc. You can get whatever makes you happy! The shakes are creamy and delicious. They're a little sneaky, because the bar is in the middle of the restaurant and the line that forms goes right past the bar, so you usually end up buying a beer while waiting in line to order. The biggest change they should make is to let people order from their booths instead of having to wait in line. I have 2 young kids (4 and 2) and waiting in line for 30 mins on a Friday night is a little ridiculous.",

The fries are also a great choice no matter what.   I have always sat at the bar when I go in and they are usually pretty quick and efficient. The bar tenders seem to get overloaded sometimes but they never let that influence or impact the service they are giving. This is one of the best burgers in the valley and I will absolutely say that going in here is a good idea.",

Positives: -Staff was friendly and kept the long line moving quickly. They even offered free sample fry cups as we were waiting! -Lots of menu options - both food and alcoholic beverages -Lots of seating available and with the way they move the line, I can't see you waiting too long for a table, if at all -Vegetarian options were plentiful -They'll customize anything you order without judgement or hesitation  Cons: -Since you order at a counter and then they deliver your food, it seemed like there was a disconnect between food runners and drink runners, as they forgot to bring a drink that we ordered until we asked mid-meal -The food was just okay, not the super flavorful burgers I remember having at this chain multiple times -Some menu items are a bit overpriced (I'm looking at you, specialty fries!)  Overall, just an average experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but I would stop here if I was in the area.",

Then, you go to a cashier to place your order and return to your table...so not traditional table service. I ordered the Primetime which is a grass fed Kobe burger with brie, arugula, carmelized onions, truffle aioli and HD steak sauce...very good but also the most expensive item on the menu. Now, my friend had the Classic which is Angus beef. I was told it had no flavor like it was lacking fat...HD grinds thier own meat so maybe they are using a very  lean mix. When we asked that the burgers be cooked medium-well we were given 'a look' like they couldn't do that...check my picture. We figured the grind was so lean that cooking past Medium it would be shoe leather....you decide. My Primetime was darn tasty.",

It was a quick process to get a table assigned order get your sauces and sit down. You must try the chipotle ketchup & the honey mustard are the best sauces!

I ordered it with lettuce, tomato, onions, with grilled mushrooms & jalapenos. All that ended up being a $13.75 burger. NOT WORTH IT! Firstly, where were my grilled mushrooms?? And secondly, you're going to charge me extra $4.75 for the impossible meat patty? And when I received my order, they added this nasty white sauce on it. They didn't tell me about it nor did I ask for it. I had to just eat it without the bottom bun that had my lettuce on it.  I could've returned it, but I was starving and we were waiting for awhile (18 mins) for our burgers to arrive. We went at 6:30, on a Tuesday night, was NOT busy.  Burger King has the impossible burger patty & I cannot WAIT to try it.  I'll probably won't come here again...so many other burger places that are wayyyyyyyyy better and tastier.",

The counter gal took our order, but was irritated that we asked about the Happy Hour burger since she told us about it as if she was on 1.5x podcast speed. Also, only 2 beers on Happy Hour, but they weren't listed on any signs or menus that we could see. So, the counter gal has to look up EACH AND EVERY BEER IN THE COMPUTER to tell us only 2 were on Happy Hour!  WTF?!  There were only 2 on HH but she couldn't recall them when a guest asks?  No one asked us if we wanted another beer. I did. But I left unsatisfied. And what's up with tipping  BEFORE you evaluate the service?  No wonder the service sucked- what possible incentive do these kids working here have to even give a shit?  I seriously don't know how this place stays in business. I guess there are lots of people who will endure shit  service for a good burger.  I'll keep looking for a welcoming place to have a good burger and A FEW beers. As I was finishing this review, finally a server came by to ask if we wanted another beer. Too late though, we were finished.",

    "text": "First note that what I need in a restaurant is pretty specific.  Good food of course, but more important than that for me is the timing.  Every weekday I leave work, pick up the little one from daycare, call a restaurant for dinner pickup, and pull in the driveway as my wife is getting home so we can all have a nice family dinner.  I have probably 6-8 restaurants in the usual rotation, but am always looking to add more good ones.  I called Hopdoddy last night from the car for pickup, and was told by the manager who may have been named Brandon that they don't do call ahead orders, but he said if I came in and ordered it would be ready in 10 minutes.  My kid is 2, so waiting in a restaurant is near the top of my list of things I like to avoid, but at this point I was already in the car, so even if I stopped for a fast food it would take almost 10 minutes, so what's the harm in the extra couple minutes?  Fine, we'll give it a shot.  So to begin, 8 minutes alone in line.  I wasn't purposefully timing it, but thanks to a phone call ending as I got there compared to the time on my receipt, the timing was done for me.  I don't blame the restaurant for this part; they have two registers to order from, but one of them was taken up for most of that time by a couple in their 80's who must have decided this was the first time they were going to order food from anywhere, or they just liked to small-talk, I'm not sure, but they took forever.  The part that really got me was that we waited 20 minutes after ordering for our food to come out (thanks again to the time on the receipt for helping me track this one).  I don't like smoke being blown up my butt by anyone, but 20 minutes with a hungry toddler is much, much more than double the headache of 10 minutes with a hungry toddler, so don't tell me 10 minutes if it's going to be 20.  Then to top it off they bring the food on 'for here' plates, despite the two places they had indicated it was take out, combined with the fact that they seated us at their mini booths specifically for take out orders, so we then had to wait while they packaged it up.  Unfortunately this place has worked its way out of the rotation based solely on the fact that they don't take call ahead orders, hopefully that new burger place opening up by Pita Jungle does now that Indulge has sadly closed down.",

We had the Goodnight Angus Beef burger with grilled onion and the sauces on the side.  It was cooked just like we requested. The side of fries was very tasty.  All served on a metal tray. They have a variety of Angus beef burgers,  a Bison burger, a Lamb burger, Black Bean corn patty, sushi-grade Tuna, Turkey and Akaushi Beef with Brie Cheese and Aioli sauce.  The drink fountain promised healthier \"cane sugar\" drinks and even my diet coke tasted better than at other places.  They have organic kale, caesar,and spinach arugala salads   We will definitely be back to try the homemade custard ice cream shakes with tempting flavors like Caramel & sea salt, red velvet cake, nutella and chocolate pretzel. Two burgers, two drinks and a large fry about $26 for hormone and antibiotic free Angus beef. Buns are baked from scratch.   Hopdoddy means beer (hop) and doddy is nickname given to native cows of Aberdeen. Did I mention they have lots of beer choices?",

The staff was extremely nice and peppy, helping us every step (literally) of the way.   You order at the window and can pick up a drink at the bar on the way. The beers come in frozen goblets big enough that you have to hold them with two hands--I was one happy girl. Try the watermelon ale like I did if you like a lighter beer, it hits the spot.   The burger list is not extensive but they are crafted well, I ordered the primetime which has Brie cheese, truffle oil, and steak sauce--why not try something rich your first time around? My friend got the el diablo burger which was nice and spicy-- they have something for everyone's taste buds.    I know this place will have a lot of success in the near future and as their shirts say \"we spank our patties and they like it\". Well I definitely approve of whatever they are doing!",

    "text": "Ever order at the counter at Wild Flower or Pei Wei, only to find there is no where to sit down? This hip new burger bar takes counter service to the next level. Staff, wearing T-shirts with slogans like \"because your mine, I walk the line\" greet you in line, and hand you a ticket with your reserved table number. Want a specific table? No worries, they will save it for you.   The special of the day was a \"Boris\" which piled tender pastrami and juicy sour krout on top of a tasty chicken burger. It came on a super soft freshly baked bun with lettuce, tomato and onion for $9. Fries were $3 more but they were thin, crispy and had bits of parsley mixed in. Very tasty.   The drink options include choices like Blueberry Root  giving their self service fountain a fun twist but there is a single Diet Coke option hidden among the more adventurous flavors. (I found this out when in a panic I asked a passing bus girl \"what if I just want a Diet Coke?!\" and she replied \"then you push the Diet Coke button\")  The milk shake flavors go way beyond strawberry, chocolate and vanilla with options like Red Velvet and Sea Salt Caramel. I actually tasted chunks of sea salt in mine! There is no $5 value menu here. The total for a burger, fries, soda and shake came to just over $20, for one person, but it was enough to share which I did. What? did you really think I ate all that by myself? Don't answer that.  PS I saw an interesting drink go by on a tray, which looked like a frozen margarita with a full upside down Corona bottle sticking out of it. Turns out it was exactly what it looked like. It is called a Skinny Dip. Apparently the beer empties into your glass as you drink your margarita. Hmmm might have to \"share\" that one next time....",

Not the best way to start the experience.  We would have ordered more than one had they been delivered timely.  The Magic Shroom burger was great, and everyone I was with loved their burgers.

You are greeted by a host at the door, handed a menu and once you walk you are greeted by a another host who hands you a number for the table you will sit at and then you approach the counter to order. It may seem efficient but with people behind you waiting you can feel a little rushed and the menu is quite extensive, front and back. After this last visit we asked for a menu to read it better and realized there are 2 types of fries! I was just ordering fries and the staff that takes your order never asked which ones I wanted. Next time I will have my order ready to go before I walk in the door.",

    "text": "I may have found burger nirvana in this place. I had heard about it several times including at the Yelp Elite Salty Sow event and then randomly from a buddy who was there and knowing I am a foodie said it would be right up my alley. So I planned to go with one of my riding buddies and lo and behold as I was waiting for him 2 of my other friends showed up (we didn't know the other would be there). Obviously word is going around about this place.  I have to say I was worried that my expectations were too high going in having heard of the wonder that was the parmesan truffle fries or the high quality meat in the burgers. Turn out I didn't have any reason to be worried at all.  This place hits the nail on the head for burgers. I had the primetime which was cooked perfectly and had such a great combo of flavors. It is easily in my top 5 burgers of all time and that is good company. I was really impressed at just how well all the flavors went together. I am glad I picked that burger as it is clearly a well crafted work of art.   I did have a hard time picking as all the other burgers sounded great too. My friends had the El Diablo and Goodnight burgers and i can honestly say I don't think I have seen burgers get devoured that fast before. Needless to say we were all impressed.  The fries didn't disappoint and the truffle sauce with them is amazing. We also indulged in some shakes. i have the Chocolate Stout Shake and it was great, the stout flavor was subtle but fantastic.  The food is a sure fire winner here....the ordering process not so much. The process for ordering isn't bad but it's awkward. What normally happens is you go through a line to order and get assigned at table where food is then brought to you. However since one buddy and I were ordering after the others we were told we could order right from the server at the table. The same was True of ordering additional food like the shakes. It was nice and our server was great it just was a bit odd. Not sure if this changes during big rushes though as we were there when it was late and emptying out.  In summary this place has awesome food go try it.",

    "text": "Hop Doddy has a serious identity crisis. Are they a counter service, are they a full service restaurant, do they have servers or just food runners, etc? It is very confusing, seems to constantly be changing, and quite frankly is really a turn off. Went today around 130p for lunch. There were a few tables outside and the restaurant was less then half full. Got in line to order and noticed they no longer have their menu posted on the large signs behind the register. Why would you take them down? It was very easy to see and look at while you're in line. We looked around and didn't see any menus either. (We noticed they were in a magazine type holder on a wall near the door when we left. Not a very visible place if you don't know they are there).  We ordered two burgers, an order of fries, a side of ranch, and a side of pickles for one of the burgers. We were asked if we would like the fries out first or with the meal. We said either. We were told to go to a specific table number, (which is kind of weird) got our own drinks and condiments and sat down. We were then greeted by an overly friendly waiter (seemed very fake) who had nothing to do for us as the way the restaurant is set up, you do most everything yourself. He said if we needed anything to flag him down. Our burgers were out within 5-7 minutes, but no pickles and no ranch, and still no french fries. We asked for our pickles and ranch and they got them fairly quickly, but still no fries. They took another 5 minutes. Really? The whole time we are there we are right next to several tables that need to be bussed and wiped down, all while the \"waiters\" are standing in the corner not doing much. It's kind of gross to look at dirty tables while you are eating. At least the food was pretty good. When we were done our waiter brings our check and doesn't even clear our trays. Our bill was 28.00 and change and now I'm supposed to tip. For what? So now I've spent 32.00 for two burgers, 2 sodas and fries, for lunch, with crappy service all around. Wow. Great. They need to figure out who and what they are as a restaurant and retrain their staff. I won't go back.",

On their opening day it was really spicy, but hasn't been that spicy since then. Either way, they will try to scare you, but really it's not all that hot.   They picked such a great location and I suspect this place will continue to be as packed as it has been in the past few days since opening up. I love the decor and ambiance they got going there.  The fries are great as well. Very fresh and not overly salty. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that they don't have traditional simple desserts. Who has room for a shake after a burger? I never understood that trend.  Also worth mentioning is the truly awesome customer service. I don't know if it's because they just opened, but it seems like they have A LOT of people working there. Which is great, they're all nice and eager to help you out.  Next I plan on trying other burger combinations as well as their grass-fed patties.",

So delicious and such a creative menu. I could come back tons of times and probably never get bored. They even have grass-fed meat and composting bins. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they are trying to be local and eco-conscious. More restaurants should be like this. The only reason for knocking off a star is for an unfair reason. I DID volunteer to sit at the bar (which is full-service where the rest of the restaurant is fast-casual style). It ended up being a bad choice, because I was right on the edge where all of the other customers are waiting in line, and some rather inconsiderate folk took it upon themselves to lean up against the bar, practically putting their elbows in my food.  Of course, this is not Hopdoddy's fault. Some people are just blind to the situations around them.",

He told me he sent it back because he thought it was undercooked. Finally came out medium well ( no pink at all). Was happy to eat it and leave instead of waiting  for a third burger. Fries needed the oil changed but, were edible. Self serve drink station was far from where we we seated, might wanna rethink that. Condiments only available in small thimble cups  and far as well.    Overpriced and underwhelming.",

Now I have to admit I'm not a meat eater so I can't say anything about the burgers, but the tuna burger I had was one of the best I've had! Cooked medium rare just like it should be and the flavors all went together well. Fries were also yummy, probably ate more of them than I should have and took the rest of my burger home. Also their $10 burger and beer deal that I think goes through the end of the month is a great deal. Service was also great.",

When we first arrived, they were giving out samples of the caramel sea salt milkshake, freakin amazing. I would have ordered one but even though I love milkshakes, they don't always love me back.  I ordered the Greek (lamb) burger; it comes medium rare, which I was fine with. I also wanted to mention that I ordered a gluten free bun, which, by the way, they make in house, very tasty, really quite delicious (not dry and cardboard tasting like Udi's). My friend got the Buffalo Bill (bison) burger and he liked it a lot. We split a large fries, and, although they informed us in advance that that the fries would come out first, I found that a bit odd, but no points off for that, since we ate all of them and they were pretty decent fries. Their sodas are quite unique, by Maine Root; I opted for the Prickly Pear lemonade soda, very sweet. No high fructose corn syrup in these babies! My friend got the Mexicane Cola and he enjoyed it. Overall it was a very good experience and we would definitely return.",

The bar felt like a sanctuary. The food was delicious. The bar even had these tiny have sized cocktaiol drinks just for sipping, perfect for those of us getting behind the wheel.

Their beer menu is great. If you're looking for domestic beers they don't have them. I highly recommend the IPA. They serve it to you in a giant goblet that is near freezing. Needless to say it was fantastic.   The line moved quickly and we were able to order then sit.   I ordered the El Diablo burger and subbed the onions for fresh jalapenos. I also ordered a side of the Parmesan crumble fries. Both were amazing. Easily one of the spiciest burgers I have had. The jalapenos and peppers were fresh as well as the beef. I would argue that you could go there and order fries alone and leave satisfied.   Did I mention for a party of 6 the price was under $70?   Can't beat cheap food/beer that is amazing!   Highly recommend this place for anyone!",

    "text": "Yes. Yes. Yes. Burgers.  Beer.  Hormone and antibiotic free prime angus beef ground fresh daily, fresh-cut Kennebec fries, buns baked from scratch, local greens (when available) and 20 plus different breweries on tap.  It's a dream for burger inamoratos.  The burger choices are as varied as the beers on tap, such as the \"Greek\" with lamb, feta, cucumber, tzatziki and the \"Buffalo Bill\" with bison, bleu cheese, and Frank's hot sauce - but for a purist like myself I enjoyed the \"Classic\".  And what a flavorful, incredibly juicy burger this was.  The patty alone stood beautifully and proudly on its own, the secret Sassy Sauce gave it an extra kick of flavor alongside the fresh lettuce tomato and onion - but this meat being so full of flavor I could have enjoyed it by itself.  The deluge of deliciousness doesn't end there, though.  The parmesan truffle fries are outstanding, the truffle aoli alone should receive an award, there are lovely salads such as Baby Kale and Spinach Arugula, and you have to complete your meal with a hand-spun shake of either Stout Chocolate or Caramel Sea Salt.  This place just gets it right on all fronts, where food is concerned.  I have never been a fan of walk up counter service, but the food is delivered to the tables and servers are visiting all of the tables to check on guests, offer refills, bring additional items, and make sure that all customers are happy.  The process appears pretty smooth and streamlined, despite the issue caused by long lines of people waiting to order when there are not enough staff members present to take orders.  When I think of excellent burger spots, this is the first pace that comes to mind. Just for the gorgeous taste and juicy flavor of the meat.",

Two quick notes:  1) After waiting for 20 minutes and being at the head of the line, the hostess or seater tried telling us that they were all out of inside seating. I told them we would wait and then counted three empty booths inside. Don't try to make a customer who has waited their turn sit in the heat (yes, even with misters), if there are open tables. That's dishonest and unfair.   2) After resolving the whole table debacle there was still another wait because one of the cashiers left and was chatting and laughing with other staff members for a good five minutes (with the line practically out the door).   Show you deserve and know how to handle your popularity. Don't seat outside unless you have to when it's over 95 degrees. And communicate with your staff that the dinner rush is not the time for breaks. Just suggestions, other than that, keep up the good work.",

    "text": "We are new to Scottsdale and found decent reviews for Hopdaddy. The name being a bit trendy had us thinking outside the box, I mean burger bar..sounds awesome, or so we thought. We shall go pro and cons to keep it simple.   Cons: No initial greeting. Right as we walked in, not only did no one say anything, but there was no hostess stand. So, we figured self-seating. Once the waitress came over and said\" Oh you guys haven't been here before, so I guess its ok\" -- Oh sorry for being a new customer, my bad. She told us to head to the back of the restaurant and stand in line to place our order. You order, and pay, before you even sit down. Are we at McDonalds?   Pro: Food came quickly. Usually we don't complain about \"too quickly\" but we wanted a nice, sit down meal...ya know time to enjoy your beverage, chat a few, enjoy the ambiance. Nope. Half way through our meal, the waitress comes back over and says.. \"can you hand me your number\" -- Really, while I'm in the middle of my meal, you want me to put down my food to hand you something..that is of NO relevance right now?? Ridiculous. Staff needs to be re-trained on customer care.   Con: Paper towels as napkins. Not my style. I guess if you wanted to order anything else you have to stand back in line..and might just loose your table. The theory of out side the box, wasn't what we had hoped. And the food was OK at best, if your name has \"burger\" in it, please have a GOOD burger. The burger was dripping..soggy bun as soon as it hit the table, and was med-rare. (They didn't ask a preference but I think med-rare as an average is a bit questionable.   Pro: Beer size for price was good. $6 for a premium draft. Everyone was drinking a milkshake, so those might be worth a try. And um...well, I guess they have a couple TV's, that's good.   Overall, we wont be going back.",

    "text": "I've been to hopdoddy several times as I live right around the corner. Overall it deserves high ratings- I would deduct a star from perfect because, like most dining establishments, there are some inconsistencies from visit to visit.   The food is typically always between good and great, depending on the time of day and day of week. I've had some phenomenal burgers & fries- best when piping hot. I've also had maybe the last batch or bottom of the basket of fries that were a bit subpar compared to what they could be fresh. The salads are also tasty- although expensive for what they are, especially if you add a patty.   I've read a few reviews of the ordering system and while I do think it can be a little bogus, I've only had trouble with it a handful of times. I personally prefer counter service so I can pay, eat, and leave without waiting for a check. However, I can see how the seating gets to be a little tedious, especially on busy days. My one gripe- affirming many reviews on here- is that sometimes there's a breakdown in communication and there are plenty of open tables but the seating hostess puts us in a \"holding pattern\" and we can't really order until having that golden ticket for a place to park our tushes. Talk about frustrating!   It's not a great place for big groups either- I once brought my family and a few friends and we had to be split up into three booths- luckily by each other but we were unable to converse with one another at dinner. There were 12 of us. I would say keep it to 6 people or less for a comfortable group experience.   I would say definitely check out hopdoddy for their food and ambiance- best to go on a less busy day or time. It's a little expensive but you do get what you pay for- high quality food and good service.",

    "text": "High hopes, with so many great Reviews, that my #1 (The Grind) and #2 (Deluxe) favorite Phoenix Hamburgers were going to be challenged.   They ware not!  That being the case the appearance of the restaurant it very nice and tidy and the service from the Staff was impeccable.   I believe the biggest problem here is that the choice of accompaniments on the menu overcome whatever flavor the beef has. My choice was Llano Pablano, just as it is on the menu. My friends was El Diablo, again just as it was on the menu. Unfortunately, in both cases the beef taste of the burger itself never came through. Given the claimed quality of the beef and the price tag, seems like it should have been far more flavorful.  The Truffle Fires were equally disappointing, only from the standpoint there was virtually no truffle flavor, although they were well cooked with  excellent texture.  The Grind doesn't have to worry about being surpassed in quality, in spite of the crowds they are attracting here.",

I wanted something spicy so I ended up getting the El Diablo and man was it spicy! It caught me off guard because I was thinking it would be a normal spicy but not spicy for me since I LOVE spicy, so it turned out to be spicier then I expected, but it was still good!!! It was a perfect combination for me with a nice juicy patty and the right amount of cheese and veggies on it.   For the fries you should get regular fries and after they bring you your food ask for aioli sauce and they'll bring you the sauce and you don't have to pay extra for the truffle fries.   They have a wide variety of beers for everyone! They have some local brews on tap which is awesome!   OH they also have military discount!!",

We each ordered a burger and a beer and shared an order of queso fries. For those who like queso fries the way they are made in Austin, I would not recommend this dish. The cheese sauce is served on the side of the fries. It was very good - just not exactly what I expected. The burgers were delicious - definitely the best in the area. I love the draft beer selection, as this is one of the only places in Arizona that serves a large variety of Arizona-brewed beers. Great place to try  a new bev and I will definitely be coming back.   I'll admit, the ordering system is a bit confusing for Arizonans (you place your entire order and pay at the counter, then they bring out your food), but they do have servers for each table if you forget to order something or need another beverage. They offer self-service all-natural sodas (yay, sugar cane), so you definitely will never need to wait for a soft drink refill.  In all, two filling burgers, two local drafts and a large order of queso fries ran about $37. I've paid way more for food and drink of a lesser quality.",

When you first arrive you are greeted and handed a menu and then you stand in line to order. Next, while in the line, you are given a piece of paper with a table number and a table is reserved for you. Finally you order. The cashier seemed a bit annoyed with our questions but wasn't too off putting.   I ordered the \"goodnight\" which had jalapenos, grilled onions, BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato.  The burger was cooked perfectly to my liking and wasn't the slightest bit dry (which is rare since I like my burgers cooked well done). The only complaint I had about the burger is the BBQ sauce is basically ketchup and I did not like it at all, so that kinda ruined the burger for me.  My boyfriend ordered the \"Llano Poblano\" which had poblanos, pepperjack cheese, bacon and he added avocado. As usual his was the better order. His was cooked nicely, as well.  We ordered the green chile con queso fries and those were amazing! The queso is served on the side for dipping and has the perfect  chile to cheese flavor! He ordered a beer and liked it while I ordered a fountain drink and was surprised (pleasantly) that they didn't have the typical brand drinks. I got a prickly pear flavored drink and it was good, I think I liked the color so therefore it made the drink better (it's hot pink).  Overall the food was good and the service was friendly.

    "text": "Full Service? Not really.  Assigned Seating? Yes.  Fast Food style line? Yes.  Tipping? Yes - jar with a reminder phrase about how tipping isn't just for cows.  Also the credit card slips have the tip line on them, but yet again this is clearly not a full service place.  Interesting.  The awkwardness started when we couldn't enter the building yet there were many open tables visible, and no apparent overcrowding inside.  They have a corral that starts outside with staff only allowing patrons in to where you find yourself paying for the 1st of multiple times - the first is a separate transaction in a standing line for your beer.  And sadly there are only Arizona beers on draft and the large size is only available in a big FROZEN schooner that you often see at old school Mexican restaurants.  After paying for the first time you continue through the line where another staff member gives you an assignment slip for your table.  Better not lose that!  And then you order at the register, pay a 2nd time, and proceed to find your assigned seat.  In my case it was 2 burgers, 2 fries for low $30's (excluding tip and excluding beer).  Shortly after this I found my beer glass empty and guess what - you must go back to the bar or find a roaming employee in your assigned seating area.  So make that a 3rd transaction for my visit.  I'm not making this stuff up.  When I thought it couldn't get much worse before I had even received my food I made the mistake of getting a nice tall glass of water from the unlabeled water dispenser which turned out to have cucumber and citrus juices in it too.  If you don't dig cucumbers, you understand the surprise.  But to make me feel better, I noticed all of the signs espousing the \"support local\" philosophy/religion and such, and for that reason I can see why they'll gain a lot of similarly minded consumers.     Food quality was in fact fairly good as far as burgers go and reminded me a lot of Smashburger, but then the inevitable comparisons of how they run the business came to mind.    In the end I find myself leaning in one of two separate directions. If I'm going to dish out this much money for burgers and beers I'd rather just be at a full service place.  Or, if I'm going to be corralled into standing lines and such then maybe I'd rather just be at a Smashburger-like place where the food is just as good but without the big dent in my wallet.",

    "text": "My wife and I tried this place on a weekday afternoon, right before lunch hour. We heard about their great burger and beer selection and were eager to give this a go.  As per the other comments, Hopdoddy is a walk up and order restaurant and then you wait your food while at your self-selected table.  They offer an amazing selection of fancy burgers all with apparent local farm supplied ties and it is impressive what they can do with a burger per their menu The self service soda machine was also unique with a selection of home made root beer and blueberry (!) soda. Now the beer selection was disappointing in that not a wide selection was on tap. I incorrectly assumed with \"Hop\" in the title the beer selection would be awe inspiring yet it was just meh. Some local faves (Four Peaks, San Tan) were offered yet nothing to write home about. All in all, was very enjoyable time yet it seemed steep to spend almost $40 for the two of us for two burgers and two drinks (no booze even).   Based on the other reviews and how busy this place was during our visit, it appears to have mass appeal yet I don't see a return trip unless under the influence of a Groupon (or someone else picks up the tab).",

    "text": "The CheezeBurger Gang invaded Hopdoddy on May 12, 2014, approximately 2pm.   The Restaurant, Very clean inside and out, some patio seating on the outside, table and booths inside, large bar with several local brews inside.   How it works \"burger bar\", you are met at the door, the hostess assigns you a table, you continue to the counter and order your burger/drinks. After the order you go find your table and they bring your food out when its ready.   We were met at the door by the hostess, she gave us a quick rundown of how it works, when I mean quick, it was. We explained it was our first time at the restaurant, we would have liked a little more info from her about the place as we told her it was our first time but we figured it out. Continued to the counter and ordered, I had the Classic bacon and cheese,  The Queen had the Buffalo Bill, The Halfy ate the Prime Time , also an order of regular fries and and truffle fries.   The soda Fountain, We later got the run down from our waiter who was able to educate on the sodas. They use all natural ingredients and make their own soda. Maybe not theirs actually but a Maine Root Soda Fountain. Tasted great and very fun.   Burgers came out very quick.. all we could say was fantastic!!! the bread was outstanding.. baked twice a day and it showed. It was soft buttery goodness. The meat, awesome very flavorful and juicy. So I would have a hard time imagining that any of their styles/burgers taste bad based on the meat and bun alone. It was really good and we are already looking forward to trying another one. The fries were awesome. They cut them themselves and they were very crispy, which is sometimes hard to do with handcut fries but they did it no problem. They have a selection of dipping sauce chipotle ketchup was good!!.   We finished the experience off with a milk shake, after the waiter said they have homemade ice cream we were sold, I had the Red Velvet, The Queen had the Carmel and Sea Salt, The Halfy ordered the Nutella and Chocolate Pretzel. FANTASTIC.. they came with a giant straw, which is needed because they all had chunks of the goodness packed inside. The big straw kind of sealed the deal they all tasted great.    PRO's, food was awesome, we will be back. The waiter was knowledgable and service was great. I think the manager was walking around saying hello but didn't make it to our table (not a big deal). Restaurant is very clean and nice.   CON's, I think they need to seat you after you make your order, it was a little confusing as the hostess selected a table for you when you entered but didn't really show you which one. Just pointed in the area where your table would be.  We ended up siting at the wrong table after the order. But she said it was no big deal. Four stars because of the seating system but maybe its different when its busy? Bottom line I think it could be improved.  Also we think its important if a customer says its their first time, educate and sell your place!! Especially this place a lot of special things they have/do.   The Cheeze Burger Gang says give this place a try and add it on your list.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been wanting to come here since it opened a few months ago.  We were forever passing by this place and it always looks happening so it must be pretty good, right?  Absolutely!  They did a great job renovating this place from a Lone Star Steakhouse (I think).  It is modern, open, and clean.  The place really is quite comfortable and a perfect place for some beers and burgers.  Most importantly it wasn't Scottsdale-doochey.  There is pretty much always a line and that's ok.  It moves pretty fast.  They ordering and seating system is pretty strange at first but there are tons of workers there that will give you the deal.  Basically, as you move through the line, you look over the menu and order a drink at the bar if you are interested.  Then, when you get to the register, you give your food order (after looking at a giant menu on the wall with no prices which pissed me off).  After you pay you find your table table and wait for your food.  After about 10 minutes your food arrives.  I know I explained the process poorly, but to sum it up think \"strange but efficient\".  Anyway, the burgers and fries I tried were excellent and likely nothing there is not a solid choice.  I want to try EVERY salad, burger, and side because they all look excellent.  Next time I'll Yelp more about the actual food instead of the actual place and process.  The staff were all very very friendly and efficient.  The only problem I have with this place is the beer selection.  It was seriously lacking.  There are like 10 things on tap (mostly local) but were things you could find at just about any other place in town.  I was hoping for some more interesting selections.  I can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Is this a social experiment to see what clients will submit to?  Upon arrival you get the awful realization that instead of having a cool meal out, you have instead walked into an overpriced fast food style restaurant, minus the fast portion.  Yes, for the honor of paying $12+ for an ala carte burger, you stand in line....for a while.....and then are assigned a table where your order will later be dropped off.  The entire process is clumsy and anyone that comes here with coworkers, or on a date, or with a business associate, or with their family should be prepared for the very awkward process.   Unless you are lucky enough to get one of the sparse bar seats, there is no table service.   Granted, if you do get that rare bar seat, you will probably love the place.   Our bartender was great, the beers cold, and the burgers were adequate....but not tasty enough if you have to sit anywhere but at the bar.  The food was edible, but at this price point you have lots of other options that will give you a more satisfying dining experience.   I strongly recommend heading a few miles south on Scottsdale Road and going to Rehab Burger instead....the difference in quality, service, and atmosphere is well worth it.",

    "text": "Hopdoddy used to be our favorite quick family spot. Not anymore.  May never step foot in this location again.  Service has always been just okay but we came for the delicious eats especially the Vegan burgers.  Tonight the restaurant was between shifts, plenty of tables and the \"server\" refused to let children and seniors sit at very open tables to rest for the 30 minute wait to be served!?!  It's a walk up restaurant.  We asked to speak w manager who was \"no where to be found\" per waiter/alleged host.  I proceeded to call restaurant and ask for manager who never came to call.  Manager finally appeared.  He was oblivious of the state of the restaurant - several people waiting, almost all tables empty except not cleared  and no one able to go to the counter due to the persistency of the waiter who put his hand up to say \"Stop you can't sit and you can't order.\"  Apparently manager was busy fixing heat lamps outside (such a necessity on a relatively warm Az night) to know the state of his restaurant.  Management offered inexcusable excuses from we were \"very short staff tonight\" to I am too preoccupied with repairs.  Great food, poor service equals failure.  Invest in your hiring, invest in your training and let me know when things change.  Food has always been great - such a shame! Check out my photo.  Does it look like a 30 minute wait???",

    "text": "We really liked Hopdoddy's fresh new variety, but found the burgers themselves a little bland.  One hiccup on our visit, as others have noted, is the service. Too many unsupervised newbies and not enough chiefs on the floor. When we arrived, we were told to wait for our greeter who would then take us to our table.  Then we were told to walk up to the counter and place our order. Grrrr  The problem was exasperated, since there was no permanent greeter. The longer we waited, the more the folks behind us started getting upset since they were outside in the heat and didn't understand the holdup.  I hope it's been fixed by now.  BTW, we very much liked the updated Philip Johnson style glass house architecture. Who would have ever thought of building a glass restaurant in the desert?  Incredible.   Hopdoddy has a bunch of interesting choices on their menu. And, it's those choices that provide the taste for their burgers, not the meat itself. The food is very good and reminded us a great deal of a Fox Concept's Zinburger. Both offer something interesting for the palate.   Expect to pay $20 each for drinks, burger and one appetizer.",

Also, I don't mind paying extra to insure that I'm getting something vegan but the second time I went I got a completely different bun, cheese, and mayo. I had no idea if it either of my burgers were actually vegan or not (I replaced all the ingredients at home the second time to make sure). The inconsistency makes me think that they probably don't care whether or not you actually get a vegan burger even though they charge you extra for it. Too bad, if it weren't for the price tag and having to replace the ingredients I would definitely be back.",

    "text": "Update to previous post: After posting my review I was immediately contacted by the regional manager who was very concerned with my experience, he wanted to get to the bottom of it and wanted to make it right. I still don't know if I'll return anytime soon but his response was enough that I wanted to add a couple stars.    I had wanted to try this place for some time as I had passed it regularly. We decided to call in an order because we have a small child and did not want to take her out to a restaurant. The person on the phone took our order and told me to pick it up at the bar. The place was very busy (which is great) but when I arrived at the bar the employees seemed very inconvenienced by my presence the manager of this establishment told me my order was in the works and then walked to a server and said aloud \"I F*@&$ing hate people who call in orders\" and went back to his work. This was completely uncalled for as I was extremely patient and understanding to the fact that they were busy and had no idea because I had never been there before. 15 minutes later I received my food and left. They had forgotten to add the avocado that we had paid extra for and the fries were over cooked beyond eating. After telling my wife what the manager had said she decided to call and complain, the manager answered the phone and said that he would never had said something like that (calling me a liar) but apologized anyway for our order and said that if she gave him our address he would send us a gift card (I wasn't comfortable with that but my wife accepted his offer) it's been months later and as expected we never received a gift card. I will never eat there again.",

Burgers were great, but the green chili queso may have been the best part. Ended the meal with a salted caramel shake that was made perfectly.",

Fabulous--served with leaf lettue, onion and a big slice of beefsteak tomato.. Husband had the Buffalo Bill--bison with bacon, onion, cheese, special sauces, leaf lettuce, beefstak tomato.  He loved it. They bake their own bread and the buns were soft and perfect.  Also tried the truffle fries--you get a huge amount, more than enough for two people to share.  Yum!  They have an ahiu burger too. The place was super clean, easy to get to, and they use locally sourced foods, and grind their own meat, Get the Root Beer to drink.  It's the old fashioned kind and is wonderful.  Worth the price. We'll be going back before our vacation is over.",

Seemed sensible that they would not take your order until they have a table for you. When you think about it, isn't that the way all restaurants work? The difference is that you stand and wait rather than sit and wait. Our order was taken in due course and then we waited another 15 minutes to pay. The payment process was very slow with only 1 register open for a line that went out the door. Finally sat down to wait again. Fries came out quickly. Portion size was not even close to the size/quantity described. I'm agree with another reviewer and prefer to eat them with my burger. By the time the burgers came, they were luke warm at best. I sent mine back as it was inedible, meaning my friends had to watch me eat it by myself. Then, the huge bill for a burger served with a roll of paper towel and ketchup in little paper cups. Not even close to worth it.",

They have one of my favorites, vanilla creame soda!!!  :D   The wife had a classic burger with bacon and a vanilla bean shake. We shared a large order of fries. The only bad thing was I didn't know they had parsley so I had to pick it off. The atmosphere in here is up scale with the set up but it is a casual dining experience.

    "text": "Exterior:  Very clean landscaping and easy parking.  The building is rather large and inviting, I like the logo of a Cow chewing on some hops.  Interior:  Green and blue colors that pop, booths and high-top tables look inviting, low tables look a tad uncomfortable for larger humans.  The booths have a rail down the middle to rest your feet which is a cool touch.  Large TVs in the four corners of the Restaurant.  Cool Bar area to the right, dining to the left.  Ordering in this restaurant requires instructions which are never a good thing in my experience.  I suppose they are doing this so people don't take up all the booths first while others are waiting in line?  So you get a table assigned to you before you can stand in line to order, seems a bit odd.  We arrived and I wanted to wait for a booth so several people were put ahead of me since they settled for a high top.  This would allow a whole family to wait in line and decide what they want instead of having to \"hold\" a seat, I didn't like it but I can see the reason they are doing it.  Food:  Burger came out medium-well when I asked specifically for well-done, tasted pretty good but in all honesty Five Guys and Smash Burger beef tastes better and I was expecting more from Hopdoddy.  I had the original burger with provolone cheese.  I also ordered Kennebec Fries which surpassed my expectations.  They have a nice selection of craft beer on tap and big ice cold chalices for serving.  I choose to sip on a Lumberyard Hefeweizen during the meal and the beer did not disappoint.  We also ordered a Caesar Salad which was underwhelming.  I know this is a burger place but if you are going to put it on the menu do it right.  The lettuce appeared maybe a bit past it's prime, it was soggy.  I expect a Caesar Salad to have crisp lettuce, there was also too much dressing and the fried Garbonzo Beans were too hard.  Last but not least was the Milkshake, we tried the Vanilla Bean to get an idea of the quality of the ice cream.  Served in a Plastic Cup with canned whip cream it was a pretty big disappointment.  Give me a nice glass cup for the price.  The ice cream did taste good, but the cheap whip cream cheapened the product.  All in all a pretty decent meal if it was a tad cheaper, I was expecting better considering all the positive reviews.  I felt the restaurant had some discontinuity between the lovely glassware for beer and plastic for the milkshakes.  I know kids come here but plastic should be requested by parents not the norm.  Seating is a bit odd but not burdensome and on my particular day there were flies all over the restaurant, not appetizing.",

We usually start by splitting the spinach/arugula salad, then he gets the Classic Burger while I love the Goodnight burger, along with a shared small order of fries.  Consistently excellent, every single time, and consistently delicious - quite possibly the best burgers we've ever had.   Realize we could make it a bit healthier by each of us ordering a salad first and then sharing a burger and skipping the fries, but our good intentions always seem to cave right as we're giving our order.  Maybe next time : )   My husband LOVES the cold beers; wine list is okay but could benefit from a bit of an upgrade.  The only thing I really don't like about this restaurant is the ordering system.   Like many other people have commented, we figured out early on to just sit at the bar so we don't have to stand in line, and since we avoid peak hours, we're usually able to get a seat.  Even so, it's not as comfortable as a table/booth would be, and while the bartenders are very attentive, there's not a whole lot of ambience - especially when you're looking at a line of people on the other side of the bar waiting to place their order.   The whole set-up just seems very odd, very awkward, and very inconvenient..... just kind of a crummy way to start what is otherwise a great dinner out.   Also seems a bit odd to have milkshakes offered as a dessert.... the ONLY item offered as dessert.   Just as well, I guess, that there isn't a more interesting/enticing selection to choose from, given how many calories we've already ingested up to that point; it just seems like a bizarre choice to have as your one and only dessert.    Having said all that, what do I know - obviously their formula works, because the place is consistently packed.   If I was reviewing it strictly on their salads and burgers, I would definitely have given it a full five stars, and I don't doubt that's the secret to their success - consistently top quality, delicious food.   The inconvenience of the ordering system isn't enough to keep us away.   We just ate there last night and I'm already anticipating our next visit!",

    "text": "After my second trip to hopdoddy I figured I'd do a review. The process of ordering is designed to get you to spend more money and receive less service and time to enjoy your dining experience. They count on most people ordering a drink at the walking bar thats your first bill. When you finally make it to the register to order your food they give you a table number and your hit with your second bill. If you'd like another drink be ready to get your wallet out for the third time. So to me they figured out how to get you to take out your billfold over and over and over again. Makes sense for the business owner as they now have several opportunities to get you to spend more money. But the customer and server are the ones on the short end of the stick. Half of you're dining experience is spent standing around being shuffled down the line with your five pound mug waiting to get your next bill. Most people tip on service which is almost nonexistent so the servers get crappy tips. The food was ok but we ordered are burger well-done both times as my wife is pregnant and cannot consume rare meat and each time they were served to us medium rare. Which brings me back to the service or lack of. No one came to check with us for about 20 minutes by then we were out the door never to return. Hey Mr. HopDoddy Your ass backwards ordering system my seem good for your bottom line but everyone in my party left pissed-off and you will lose your customer base...",

First of all, no matter how long the line outside is, the hostess will give you the standard answer \"20 minutes\". It feels as though they love people standing out front in line to try and create a buzz. This is a restaurant, not a new nightclub. Well, it might be 20 minutes to get inside the front door, then another 15-20 to order. It's a very strange concept. If you are lucky you may get your own table. If not, they will either put a small partition on your table that you are sharing, or you may get a table alongside the line of people waiting to order. Problem is, you can hear the conversation of your table mates, rather you want to or not. Food is above average, and the shakes are very good. It is a little pricey. About $40 bucks for 2 burgers with fries and one shake and a soda. I can only hope they change their ordering and seating concept.",

Although at least one other review complained about only having Arizona beers I thought that was a strength. The problem is that this isn't a normal restaurant. There are elaborate procedures to line you up, educate you on how to order, identify a table, then order at a cash register, then get your own condiments and soft drinks or water then carry your drinks, etc to the table. Tipping is expected though no service was provided except taking an order and identifying a table.  From there it is full service. The only service I can think of other than food and alcoholic beverages already ordered at the cashier would have been a second drink but we had our food shortly after beverages so didn't need another or dessert which wasn't needed. The waitress seemed nice and did check back. Something else which bothered me is that silverware is not provided except a steak knife and there are no napkins, just paper towels. So great burgers, good beers, complicated self serve systems and no table setting. I like restaurants. This doesn't meet my desires. I am not sure how mobility challenged customers could do it. I couldn't bring my wife. But good burgers...",

At first, the ordering process seemed a little strange in that you order your food at the cashier, then go searching for a table with your order number.  It's not traditional but efficient.  The quality of the burger is first rate.  They know how to cook a burger medium, which is something a lot of places screw up.  The ingredients are fresh....let me repeat....the tomato is fresh cut (looks vine ripened) and the lettuce is crisp and clean.  These are the little details that separate hopdoddy from 98% of burger joints.  Long story short, you get a high quality burger for the same price that would spend at a second rate greasy rag joint like five guys.  That being said, they are not the best burger in town...that honor still belongs to z-tejas' hickory burger! (Different price point but worth the extra bucks)",

My husband loved his el Diablo, my stepdad loved his classic. My mom was pleased with her burger (lingua something?) and I was dissatisfied with my continental club, which was not a good turkey burger. My husband said he would definitely return. 12 hours later, 3 of the 4 of us had food poisoning which lasted about 36 hours. This is the only food we all ate that could have made us sick.

Check out their Instagram for any special burger of the week/month.  Sides: You must get their parmesan truffle fries. The sauce it comes with it is to die for as well.

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in this place. I came in this evening for the first time with a friend of mine( who happens to own a restaurant in Scottsdale)way after the dinner rush. Ordering at the counter was easy, I chose the Bison Burger and my friend got the Ahi Tuna Burger and Truffle Fries. I was asked if medium rare was good, I said yes. As we were standing there, I noticed several already made burgers sitting under the warmers, yet the place wasn't busy enough to have that many going out to customers.   No sooner had we gotten to our table and barely sat down and our Truffle  fries appeared. Now I am not a fry expert, but it takes longer than the 45 seconds it took to get to our table to make a fresh batch of fries.  My friend agreed. Ok,whatever, they are just fries.  However, not even 2 minuted later our burgers arrived. Well my friend thought it may be possible to sear the Ahi that fast but there is absolutely no way that you can cook a Bison burger to medium rare in 2 minutes.  Sure enough, it was lukewarm. It had been one of the ones sitting under the warmer. I brought it up to the manager,Mike, and he agreed it  shouldn't be lukewarm and said he would cook another.  Here comes the new one. Definitely hot and fresh. You can smell it and feel it. Now to cut into it. At first glance it looked ok until I took a bite and realized it was raw. Couldn't believe they served me raw bison. Went back to the manager again and showed him. He said he cooked it according to the time designated for medium rare. 1 min 45 seconds on each side then another 1 min 45 seconds to finish cooking. I don' t know who came up with that time table but it certainly is not enough time to cook a Bison burger. Manager apologized and was going to redo another . That one came out hot,fresh but medium well. I didn't have the heart to send it back again.  The only reason I gave it 1 star was because the beer came out in a very chilled, chalice-like glass which was nice. However we had to flag down our server to bring us the other beer we had ordered. He totally forgot, said some drama was going on.  Unfortunately I don't think my friend and I will be coming back. If this is how they are when it is slow, I would hate to see what it is like when it is busy.",

Despite that, the food was amazing!!! I had the Greek Burger (lamb with arugula, tzatziki, cucumber, feta, tomato) - super fresh and filling! My friend ordered the La Bandita (black bean) and the truffle fries, which were both delicious as well.   Save room for a milkshake too! The Nutella and chocolate pretzel one was wonderful.",

The cashier was too busy discussing how much money they made in tips to wait on us, but finally asked us what we wanted. Then I don't get a reciept and am told to go to table ??? Don't talk to me or I'll forget the number! The chairs are sooo tall I almost have to jump to get on it.... the burger was under cooked - but better than overcooked. And the whole concept is too expensive if I have to wait in a line to order. Just disapointed....",

She was so preoccupied with something on her mind, it was almost comical, but it was our food and were not done eating. We are glad that we came back as Elizabeth was on top of of her game.  We had the Buffalo Burger an Mushroom Burger no chesese and hats off too the chef as you can see from the pictures they were cooked perfectly.

The stand in line to order and receive a table number to sit at after ordering seems weird, but it's so Efficient! We went at 7pm (it was packed), we waited in line for about 20mins, however it went FAST. The staff is constantly bringing over samples for you to try, they take your drink order while in line so you can sip while you wait- lots of local drafts available and they even make their own triple sec and lemoncello!   The food is made fresh- and it's amazing! Every person in our group ordered a different burger and different style fries- ALL were GREAT! I ordered the shroom burger that has goat cheese and pesto on it and WOW! Best burger I've had ever. Parmesan truffle fries were mind blowing good! Every person working was positive, nice and really wants you to enjoy your dinning experience there! Also, a huge plus in my book is that they recycle and compost!  We will be back for sure. Well worth the drive from the West Side of the Valley!",

Problems with this process:  Open tables are abound, but you stand in line for 20 minutes.  You order once, and food is brought to you.  There is no way to order more food or drinks.  The burgers were good, staff was friendly, but the experience poor.  I'll come back when they rethink the process, as it is pointless.  Avoid unless you like lines.",

Even though we are only behind 10 people, it took 15 minutes to put our order in, due to only one person taking orders at the cash register.  Next, the receptionist could never get our table right. They gve us a number and others were sitting there. Utter confusion.  Next, our orders came out cold and when we told one of the servers that the meals were Cold, they looked stunned when we asked them to take it back to the kitchen and heat up our meal.  After waiting 10 to 15 minutes to get our order back, we finally decided enough was enough and decided to leave and received a refund.   All in all, they made the burger bar experience super challenging and we never got to truly even taste a burger. Hopefully, better training and systems will  be put into place as we would like to come back and try the food.",

Also noteworthy, you can mix up their Maine based soda drinks to create different flavors.  Their staff can provide some recommendations on those.    Definitely worth visiting for a good burger if you're a local or just visiting the area.",

    "text": "Loved the menu options!  I'm not a burger person, but I got the Thunderbird chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  They've got a nice selection of mixed drinks and beer, and I loved the green chili queso.  I thought this place was packed when we got there, but when we left the line out the door was even longer!  Despite how busy they were, the line did move at a fairly good pace.  And you walk by the bar so you can order a drink while you're waiting in line.  To continue with what was good about this place, after we were seated with our food, our server came around frequently to refill drinks and such.  Also, being as I was pregnant and couldn't indulge in one of the delicious-looking cocktails, I indulged in a Raspberry White Chocolate shake... mmm.  The \"cons\" I had are more \"FYI\" as they don't reflect poorly on the restaurant itself.  It's more of a \"know your venue\" type of thing.  Tip #1: This place is not the best for large groups, especially during busy times (a fact they even warn you about on their website).  It's just not set up for it.  We had a group of 8 of us, and did actually manage to get tables next to each other, but that was pretty lucky and it was still hard to have a conversation with anyone other than those at your immediate table (the tables don't push together so each table is spaced apart from the others).  Tip #2: This place is not toddler-friendly.  Or even really kid-friendly.  For several reasons.  First, you have to stand in line to order (which can be a long line if they're busy).  Never fun to stand in a narrow, crowded line with a toddler.  Second, they have no kids menu.  Not that your kids can't eat off the adult menu, but the burgers are a little pricey to get one just for your kid.  Come prepared to share, I guess.  And third, there's no real seating for kids.  Tables are high up, and not set up for either high chairs or booster seats.  Possibly the tables outside could work with a high chair, if they even have them (I didn't ask, since there was no point with our indoor tables.  I mean, those tables were tall!)  Again, I want to re-iterate that those things are not \"bad\" things!  I mean, they were unfortunate for me and my large party with toddlers, but that's our fault for not picking a more family-friendly restaurant, and not Hopdoddy's fault.  If you're a couple with a young baby, or a family with older children, great!  Bring your kiddos!  But if you've got a large group or small children, be forewarned.",

Also, they have sodas by a company I've never heard of. We tried a couple and they were good. We settled on the Root Beer. All in all, great meal in a place with a cool vibe. Will return - quickly!",

First thing that drew my attention were the \"handcrafted\" fountain sodas. They don't have coke or Pepsi products which I though was really cool I tried the vanilla cream and it was delicious! They also have a full bar right in the center of the restaurant so I think this would be a cool spot for after work or just to grab a drink. It's very casual and relaxed! Not sure if they have a happy hour but I would imagine they do?!?  Its a order first then sit down at a table type thing. They deliver your food to your table based on a number they give out. It really didn't take that long for our food to come out, the friea came out way before the burgers which is new for me. I guess I usually think that burgers and fries are served/eaten together.  They have truffle fries OMG, get them!!  I had the ahi tuna burger, which was seared in both sides and served with domain lettuce, red onion and tomato. Best part was the terriyaki glaze and wasabi cream spread that came with it. Wasabi sauce was pretty hot though so be careful.   Only thing is they are a little pricey for what it is, then again they are in Scottsdale so I guess the prices are comparable.",

They have high chairs and portable high chairs that latch to the table end. Very accommodating for a big family. Ambiance is loud, decor and style is modern, and great curb appeal from outside.

    "text": "Burgers are so trendy these days and you don't find me complaining! The hamburgurlar and I have one thing in common: we both love burgers! It's my cheat food any day of the week. Give me a burger, fries (and maybe even a milkshake) and I'm one happy girl. Granted, I don't eat my favorite meal every day of the week, which is why it's such a special treat when I do. Being a huge fan of Roaring Fork and Salty Sow, I was very excited to give Hopdoddy Burger Bar a try. The verdict? Folks, they did it again!   Here's how it works:   There are three ways to enjoy a meal here. You can post up at the bar, you can dine in or you can get take out. Whichever option you chose, you will start by first going up the counter and ordering your meal. If you plan on dining in, once you order, the server shows you to a seat so you don't have to fight other patrons to score a table. The server will then bring the food out to you and you can enjoy your meal!   Now on to the food. The burgers are why you come here, but they do have other delicious food as well! I especially love the Classic Cheeseburger and french fries, but the cous cous is delicious, as is the Kale Salad with Baby Kale Leaves, Arugula, Feta, Watermelon, Avocado, Sunflower Seeds, Pickled Red Onions and Pomegranate Vinaigrette. Actually, all of there salads looked delicious. While I love the Classic, they also have several funky burger options, such as the Buffalo Bill with Bison, Blue Cheese, Frank's Hot Sauce, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Sassy Sauce, the El Diablo with Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Caramelized Onions, Habanero and Serrano Chiles, Salsa Roja, Chipotle Mayo, an Ahi tuna burger, turkey burger and veggie burger, etc, etc. There's a burger for all palettes here!   Now let me talk about my other favorite part of the meal. Mmmmm....milkshakes! Oh yes, they have milkshakes here and a.m.a.z.i.n.g ones at that! I had the Nutella and Chocolate pretzel and yes my friends, it's as good if not better than it sounds. I might just stop in for a milkshake one of these days, but then I don't think I could resist a burger to go with it!",

And she was awesome! When we asked for ketchup she brought us approximately 700 little cups of it, cause you can never have too much. I like a little bit of fry with my ketchup, if you catch my drift. The food was phenomenal. Truffle Fries were lit. Huge portion! More than enough for two people.  I had the Shroom burger and I'm still dreaming about it. The combination of beef, mushrooms, goat cheese, and basil pesto was just heavenly. They really know what they're doing to build a perfect burger. My lunch date had very specific request for hers (yeah she's one of THOSE ;) and they were happy to abide the substitutions/additions and it came out perfectly.  We'll definitely be back for more ketchup, I mean food !!! If you don't want to get messy, maybe don't come here. If your pants are already too tight, maybe don't come here- or at least be prepared to pop the first button. If you want amazing burgers, fries, and service (and you're comfortable rocking a food baby for the rest of the afternoon) I would highly recommend checking it out.",

You pony up to a single line, (while conveniently standing next to the bar), place your order and mozy out to a table that's been held for you. Family friendly yet not overwhelming. Booths abound (seating about 4ppl). Tables in the center of the restaurant can accommodate larger groups. The bar is also a great place to sit and graze.  Tip: If there's a line sit at the bar!  Happy Hour is M-Th. (2-6pm) And(!) the Doddy Deal is $9.95:  -Classic Burger w/Cheese -Kennebeck Fries + a soda (Coke or Root Beer)  No wonder there's a line to the door!  Now, for the food. There are tuna burgers in the world, and then there is the Ahi Tuna Burger at Hopdoddy. Sweet heavenly geezus, You. Must. Eat. This.  Let me repeat: Ahi Tuna. GET IT!  Por quoi? Pan seared with a robust area of pinkness. I've had the delight of biting into this burger twice. Typing this I crave it again. (It's *that* good.) Sprouts, teriyaki, honey wasabi, pickled ginger and mayo are best friends with nori chips. The crunch reminded me of stuffing potato chips into sandwiches as a child. Sushi is on par with a top of the line sushi joint. (Yeah, seriously.)  When the truffle fries came out I reached greedily for them. (My friend was not as much in love. When she said truffle fries are a competitive market I thought, \"GOOD. More for me. Now move your hand.\")  Jesse, our bartender, was filled with stories. Katy, a server in the dining area, is a hoot. People working at Hopdoddy enjoy what they're doing and the good vibes make the time pass.  Feel free to buy me a gift card online. You know I'll use it!",

I just saddle up to the bar and get quick service there.  Aside from creating my own burger, I can only order one of their twelve crafted burgers without having to omit key ingredients.  All of the rest either have sauces that contain cornstarch, or corn syrup (sassy and steak sauces), too hot to even consider (El Diablo), or have items I am allergic to.  Yes, I can ask for them to omit these items, but then all that is left is the burger patty and bread!  So it's the Llano Poblano for me. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hopdoddy-burger-bar-scottsdale?select=lAFmVsT17iI25nVUvualDg#lAFmVsT17iI25nVUvualDg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hopd...</a>  A bit greasy due to the grilled poblano and slices of bacon, but very delicious!  The brioche is nice, but I'd like to try it with whole wheat next time.  (If I should ever feel like going for The Classic, I might as well wait for it to go on special-- classic burger and soda for $10, but I'd sub something else for the soda.)  I also tried the delicious Peach Cobbler milkshake special, which goes off the specials board this Sunday to make room for a new selection.  If you like peaches and pies, then you will LOVE this.  Peach puree and marinated peaches (in triple sec, I'm told), homemade caramel sauce, and pie crust** mixed in Hopdoddy's vanilla ice cream base.  Go and get some before it's too late!    Oh, and many thanks to Jesse for delivering on my request for ice-cold Oak Creek Nut Brown. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hopdoddy-burger-bar-scottsdale?select=DBsmT8GBMoxGjQgo_Qs9kA#DBsmT8GBMoxGjQgo_Qs9kA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hopd...</a>  I only enjoy beers when they're so cold there are ice crystals in them.  Check back for the photos, which I'll add in a few days.  The frosted glass was gorgeous!  **Made especially for this milkshake.  Hopdoddy's dessert menu only features milkshakes and nothing else.  I really enjoy the one made with Nutella and chocolate-covered pretzels!",

I'll give it another shot sometime, maybe the tuna burger was a poor choice on my end.",

However, they grind their own meat, bake their own buns etc... so they make higher quality food.  I had the Greek burger, it was a little light on flavor. A Lamb burger's sauce should be more pronounced. But it was still great because the fresh flavors were satisfying none the less.   The truffle fries are great, and the aioli  sauce was very garlicky, but in a very good way.   All in all it was a great experience. The staff is nice and normal, the food is crafted and presented professionally and the environment is inviting.",

Despite having over 13 open tables, the restaurant was on a \"seating hold\" and would not take any orders.  The ratio of open tables to patrons waiting to be seated was 2-to-1.  After waiting for over 20 minutes, we finally asked to see the manager.  The manager was  rude and aggressive, explaining that the hold was because they didn't have any open tables.  Ha!  Obviously, he was holed-up in the back, oblivious to the fact that there were so many open tables, many that hadn't been cleared.  His response could have been apologetic, but instead it was aggressive.  Such a shame.  One bad experience like this completely turns me off to an establishment.  Having worked in the restaurant business for a number of years in college, I can tolerate service issues or kitchen mix-ups, but I cannot tolerate inconsiderate and/or rude management.  You can do better and may want to consider dining elsewhere.",

However, it was a little cold when it arrived at my table, so I feel like it would have been even better had it been warm.   We also ordered the truffle fries, and those are my FAVORITE. I am a sucker for truffles and these fries are the best. The dipping sauce is perfect, and they give you a large amount so make sure you have someone to share with!

You can't go wrong with anything on their menu- variations of fries, burgers, and shakes.  The best part is the happy hour where the burger special and shareable fries are $5.  The November special, the au jus burger, is one of the best I've ever had.  You also can't miss the green chili queso fries and the buffalo fries- so good!",

It was my brother's birthday on Saturday and he insisted we come here! Now, you know a place is special when the vegan of the family chooses to go to a burger bar on their birthday. He of course ordered the black bean burger and fries. As usual, he loved it. So much so that he came back the next day for another one!    Since I'm not a huge burger person, I usually go for a turkey burger at places like this. I can confidently say, this is one of the best (if not THE best) turkey burgers I have ever had! It was topped with pesto, provolone, arugula, tomato, onion, and bacon. I only have one word... WOW. It was so fresh and exactly what I was hoping for. Next time I'm here and feelin' adventurous I'll go for one of their crafty burgers and a shake.  I should also mention that the staff was so awesome and patient with me and my family! I'm glad I was finally able to make it in again so that I could discover the valley's BEST turkey burger and also to remind myself how great this place is! See ya very soon, Hopdoddy!",

The menu had a lot of interesting burger options and the guy who helped us was super patient and nice.   I had the prime time burger (arugula, Brie, and caramelized onions). My bf had the terlingua burger (chili cheese and Fritos). My burger was really tasty. The Brie was not subtle at all and the arugula gave it a nice bitey taste, I removed most of the onions lol but kept some to get the idea, definitely complimented the cheese. It was super flavorful but the Brie was a lot for my taste, usually I love it because it's so mild but on this it was very in your face. The terlingua burger was great! The chili and Fritos added a lot of yummy, zesty flavor.   We also had Parmesan truffle fries and fries with quest, both were sooooooo good! The garlic aioli with the fries it sooooo delicious, cannot recommend it enough.   Everything was really quality. Although I didn't love love love the burger I chose, it was still an awesome meal. I would definitely recommend this spot for great burgers with a lot of fun and interesting toppings.",

I am a big fan of the Hopdoddy on Camelback so I was excited there was one in Scottsdale that my husband can stop by and pick up an order for us on his way home. He was also excited that one was close by as well so I placed an order online to be picked up asap.   The online ordering system was pretty easy and they require a credit card to complete the order. I decided to order the PrimeTime, Parmesan truffle fries, and the Nutella pretzel shake. When hubby came home with my order, I dug in and the burger was delicious and satisfying. The fries were a little salty but I still ate them and the shake was good. I only consumed half of it because I thought it had too much pretzel in it. Overall, I'm a fan and I'll be back!",

The burger was cooked to my liking and tasted like quality ingredients. The fries were okay but the truffle sauce was really strong and I wasn't able to eat too much of it so the fries were a little bland without it.

You walk in and order at the register and they assign you to a numbered table. They have a full bar and we asked where we order drinks. The cashier was very nice and stated we could order with her, or order with our server. We opted for our server.   We did NOT have a server. No one talked to us our entire experience unless we went out of our way to approach someone.   Burger was amazing, but we had ordered some of their specialty fries and we were long done with the burger before we ever got our fries. It took closer to 45 minutes to receive them, and my boyfriend actually had to get up and ask the cashier about them. When the were served, they were delicious. They definitely understand food.   I just really wish our first experience here was better because the food was amazing. But overall their business model just doesn't make sense to the consumer.",

After finding out that Scottsdale has Hopdoddy, I immediately started salivating over their crafted burgers. Tonight, the craving has been satisfied.   The cashier taking my order was so enthusiastic about helping me pick out my order that he essentially told me I needed to try half the menu. He followed up with \"you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu\". I got wild and picked the Magic Shroom with an easy over egg. Medium rare.  I think my favorite part about this burger was the goat cheese. It really enhanced and complimented the Angus beef. The egg yolk was a little runny (and I like it like that) but you can ask them to cook it all the way if that's your preference.   Overall, best burger in the WORLD. Definitely bringing my family and friends when they come in town.",

We hung out for a little, greeted by Chase, the host who was VERY helpful and professional. Then we reached the Cashier after about 30 minutes waiting in line and watching everybody socialize at there table, not minding the huge line in the middle of the restaurant. We ended up deciding to take it to go and Chase guided us from the line to the bar, where we got service almost instantly. Thank you Chase and thank you Hopdoddy for the great food even when busy!",

    "text": "Hopdoddy's fatal flaw is their service. It's not that the people who work there aren't nice, it's that after you order, there is no service. You literally see no one besides the person who delivers your food. It's a \"walk up and order\" place, you don't have a server, but it's also an expensive place. It's not like you're at McDonald's. No one stops by to see if your order is right, if the food tastes good, or if you got your drinks.... which we did not. It's always busy at Hopdoddy, so they can't blame poor service on that. As time ticked by and other people around us got their drinks, we looked around for someone to ask. No one. The line to order was about 20 people deep, and the cashier doesn't make the drinks, so I didn't interrupt her. I couldn't get near the bar.  The food arrived after about 15 - 20 minutes, and I asked when we would get our drinks. The person delivering the food asked what we had for drinks and said he'd be right back with them..... and..... nothing. After waiting then taking a few dry bites of our burgers before they got cold, I finally got up and forced the girl giving out table assignments to talk to me. She grudgingly said she would check on the drinks, and granted, it wasn't her job. Another 5 minutes after that, she comes by with the drinks, looking put out, sort of slaps them on the table and says, \"there you go\" and walks away without looking at us.   Burgers were good, fries were okay, too greasy and needed salt. Oreo shake was good. It's not cheap to eat at Hopdoddy and the food wasn't good enough to make us deal with that shirtshow again, we won't be back.",

I'm sure the list was not in any particular order but I chose this place to meet a few friends.   Simple ordering process goes like this... customer places their order at the counter, you find a table and a place to sit and the server brings you your order. You pay your bill to your server. I placed my order for a Buffalo Bill (bison, apple-smoked bacon, blue jack cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato in sassy sauce). Comes with hot sauce but I didn't want it in my burger so they placed it in a small container on the side. Everything was delicious! While I had the bison burger, the rest of our group tried the other specialty burgers: Magic Shroom, Llano Poblano, El Diablo, Primetime and Thunderbird. I also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries w/ Truffle Aioli... wow! mouth soiree! So delicious! For dessert, the manager (or owner) was kind enough to give us a sampling of their popular shakes including Nutella Chocolate Pretzel and the Pumpkin Cheesecake shake (seasonal).  They serve the freshest all-natural ingredients including their patties (no growth hormones and antibiotics)... so yummy and tender meat! The restaurant is quite big with a casual setting. There are both booths and tables available with outdoor patio seating on both sides of the restaurant. The staff is friendly and our server was awesome! Gosh! forgot his name but shout out to our server at Table #31.  TRIVIA: How Hopdoddy got its name: Hop for beer and doddy because it's the nickname of a tasty cow. Enjoy!  Review #0601",

Jumped in my car and drove the five miles to Hopdoddy, sat at the bar, declined the menu the bartender offered me because I already knew what I was having. \"I'm having The Greek,\" I proclaimed! His face shifted to a look of sadness as he informed me they no longer have the item on their menu, but maybe I'd want to try something else?   What the shit??   I begrudgingly took back the menu, simmering. I didn't come all that way for \"something else.\" Oh hey, look ... they revamped their whole menu. They got rid of the eye-catching design of their previous menu, with the unique fonts for each burger. They've switched to a HORRIBLE two column format. No, seriously ... the format of your new menu is not the one you want. It doesn't flow and is confusing to the eye, and ... of f*ck it. You're not going to change things because of my Yelp review. Whoever told you to change things, though, was wrong! Bad, BAD advice.   It's not my business.  Do whatcha like.   I got up and left without ordering anything; disappointed.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I have been a long time patron of this restaurant, but have steadily slowed down on choosing hopdoddy on Scottsdale rd. Mitch and Matt are great bartenders, and provide great service but if you don't have fhe luck of getting them service is very spotty to be polite. They are the reason for 2 stars and not 1.  We just finished dinner here and I chose this as a shot for redemption as the last two visits have been very underwhelming. Tonight was more of the same. The restaurant was pretty quiet, as to be expected on a Sunday night after 7pm in Scottsdale. We sat at the bar and service was very sub par. I am the only member of our group daring enough to order a rare burger, the other members med rare, medium, and med well respectively. Everyone received rare burgers. This could be easily fixed if your bartender simply asks \"how did everything come out\". This question was never asked, nor were we so much as checked on the entire meal. Some of us sat with empty drinks since the food arrived, never even checked to see if we needed refills, sauces, anything. Not to mention, since I got the sauces for our group, the sauce station looks like a bomb went off. The appearance of this station didn't reflect that of a nice establishment that was 3/4 empty and fully staffed on this Sunday night.  The finale was receiving the $41.23 dinner bill for two people, paying and not so much as a thank you from the bartender upon dropping completed payment. Sorry dude, not gonna leave you a good tip when you don't so much as attempt to provide service to your guests. Sad to see this restaurant fall off my list of neighborhood staples, but this is strike 3. Hope they can get it together for the sake of their future guests.",

You can also just order from the waitress or waiter if you opt not go on the counter.  The place have outside sitting, indoor bar, booths and table with tv broadcasting any sports that are currently playing (just like any sports bar.    I had a bison burger and garlic/Parmesan ... oh that was delicious.  If you are not familiar with bison, In my opinion it taste better than the regular \"cow\" meat / burger we usually get.  The attendants  in this place are very friendly, hospitable and GO out to the extent to provide good service, the place is clean, the rest room is clean and sanitary and if I ever come back in Scottsdale AZ I will sure to visit this place and eat here.  I recommend for those who are passing by to come and try this experience.",

I could go on and on about how wonderfully constructed the burgers are, and how diverse and interesting the menu is, or how nicely cooked the fries are. But this place stands out from a lot of the competition by offering OUTSTANDING SERVICE, AWESOME MILKSHAKES.  Service- a woman greeted us as soon as we arrived, and reserved us a table immediately. this is genius. it takes away the awkwardness of hunting for a table after ordering in a fast food style line up. this places was designed to move people as efficiently as possible, and its wonderful. it combines the efficiency of assigned seating like in a sit down restaurant, with the speed and accuracy of multiple cashiers like in a fast food joint.   Milkshakes- i prefer shakes made with real ice cream instead of soft serve, but these shakes are awesome. both creative and wonderfully made. i can also see how soft serve is much easier and quicker to make. so from this perspective it makes sense with how busy it gets.   I haven't gone into too many specifics about individual items, because they are ALL equally awesome. I could write volumes about these burgers that would dwarf the Harry Potter series.   The only downsides is that it can get insanely busy, and that there isn't a location in my hometown of Toronto, Canada.   It is essential that all burger lovers visit this place.",

With that in mind, when we arrived every customer seemed confused by what to do (not sure why, but it was quite odd). After you've placed your order, you grab your own stuff and then sit down at your pre-assigned seat, when all of the sudden a waiter/waitress appears... please tell me why couldn't we just sit down and have a waitress from the beginning then?? Plus, if most of your staff is standing around you probably aren't utilizing them and if you need to have 2 of them to stand by the door to instruct your customers on what to do, maybe its not a good plan... but I digress.   I tried the the primetime burger, was pretty good, but would get something different next time. My friend tried the El Diablo burger and was extremely happy with it; I tried a bite and it was delicious.   Overall, yummy burgers, house-made sauces, and pretty decent drinks.",

The burger was actually very good.  You can tell that it's a quality burger.  I ordered the basic cheeseburger with fries and a drink.  So why the 3 stars.  First, the off brand sodas! I chose the Diet Mexican and it wasn't exactly what I would call appealing.  It left an after taste that wasn't pleasant. Many others may find it tasty.  The burger? As I said, yes it a quality burger.  But I have to say it's nothing extraordinary, in fact I thought it was a little bland.  Maybe the beef was too good of quality for a burger, that rendered it rather meh tasting.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad burger.  The fries were the thin kind which I like and they were pretty good, tasted more like chips.  The other point I have is that for $15.00 (and that's probably the cheapest combo you can get) I expect to be wowed, and I'm sorry to say that didn't happen.",

    "text": "Full discourse: my favorite cheeseburger is at Houston's, so it is the standard to which I compare any other burger. When I first started eating at Hopdoddy I thought it was really good. I normally get the Goodnight Good Cause along with some truffle fries, green chili queso and a brew. After several months of patronizing the place, I noticed their portions got smaller. I don't know if the crew working there was making things too big, or if they indeed made the portions smaller, but in any case I didn't think that was cool. Personally, I don't find much difference between the truffle fries and regular fries, especially when you're dipping them in queso like I do. They do have a full bar and I like to take advantage of a pre-meal drink snack and opt for a Little Larry with Chambord. I've read many people complain about the concept's seating situation and lately I agree. The issue is that you walk up, place your order AND THEN get assigned a table. This really throws people off because sometimes people walk in and sit wherever they want while the rest of their party goes up to order meanwhile, the staff assigns that seat to someone else and then you have a problem. The employees are usually cheery and the only reason I gave them 3 stars is because the food is average and then shrinking of the burgers isn't cool when they're charging the same, if not more for less.",

It's the place to go if you want a fast food feel with high quality ingredients, but without the fast food checkout.   We were expecting to be wowed by the chocolate shake, but found it to be a big squeeze of Hershey's syrup and vanilla soft serve ice cream. It was on the soupy side and overly sweet. The Parmesan truffle fries had a great seasoning, but were brown and either soggy or overly cooked.   I had the magic shroom, ordered medium-rare. It was cooked to perfection and everything about it was exactly what I was hoping for. My boyfriend and daughter had classic burgers. The bottom bun was mushy and all the juices soaked through, causing it to leak everywhere. They ordered their burgers medium-well and it was closer to medium-rare. My daughter also said that she felt the tomato tasted sour.  People that want the experience of walking up to a counter to order something, should try this, but be prepared to calculate the tip before you leave. They don't tell you your total until you've finished eating. The next time we're in Scottsdale, we'll be going to Lucky's.",

Checked in on my gf and I after HE noticed (no one else did)  that no one for the first 10 mins we were there came by and asked us for a drink order, water, nothing. Kudos to this dude tho. He is the 1-star.   Service was awful. I think due to two waiters not being sure who had our table (#77).   Food-- burgers are small. 6 bites. 6. And I had ate my entire burger. I'm a 5'10 190lb guy.  I'm average. Burger done in 6 bites. 6. Bites. Truffle fries were good, flavor wise, but there wasn't a frie longer then an inch. We got the bottom of the fry basket. I ordered a beer, Grand Canyon Pilsner......you guessed it, they were out of that beer.   The place was packed, seems popular and avg on Yelp was 4-stars. But I'll take Red Robbin, In&Out, Five Guys, Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers each much 'lesser' burger joints if you class them, but far superior from a food/value standpoint.",

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday night around 6pm and it was packed! I almost wanted to leave because of how chaotic it was. However, we decided to stay since I had a coup for BOGO free burger. I had the ahi and my boyfriend got the la Bandita and we split the green chili cheese fries.  The green chili cheese fries were delicious, I almost got full after eating that alone. The portion is definitely large enough to share. I got the ahi burger with the honey wasabi on the side and am so glad I did. If you don't care for wasabi, ask for it on the side or without it. It was different than any other ahi burger I've had before... messy but delicious. My boyfriend really enjoyed his too.  Aside from the chaotic ordering process and not being able to change the tv (how do you not have a remote to change it to the playoffs?) the food is pretty tasty and worth checking out.",

Got $2 off on fries, THAT'S IT! Waitress did not tell us what burgers are $5!!!  Two stars are for the fries and shakes.  The Burgers were very salty and their sauces tasted weird.

It was totally packed which was a good sign but it also made the vibe seem really hectic.  The food was nothing exceptional.  The burger and the salad were good but not great. (even the hair that was in my burger didn't make it awesome)  The fries were mediocre.  The beer was good but it wasn't THEIR beer.  They have a bunch of local breweries on tap which is super cool but doesn't really mean points for Hopdoddy's.  Its more like points for the breweries.  Our \"server\" came in the middle of our meal to introduce himself as our server which was super confusing.  Not really sure why he is called a server.  I go to Chic-fi-la and they will bring me my food the same way and will refill my beverage but they don't ask for a tip.  Apparently I am tipping someone for introducing himself as my server.  Not really cool.  I would rather give my tip to the hostess.",

    "text": "I went to Hopdoddy yesterday with a few friends. I was excited to try this place since it is associated with the Salty Sow, which is fairly delish. Also, I had a coupon, so I was excited about that as well. I got to the restaurant later than my friends, so they told me to just sit at the table and they would come take my order instead of having me order at the counter. All of the employees were friendly and accommodating. I ordered a goodnight burger, sassy sauce on the side (sassy sauce is like a mayo, horseradish, and mustard concoction) with a fried egg on top and a pretzel nutella shake.... so pretty healthy. The shake was awesome. I don't typically like or order shakes, but this one was a good mix of salty and sweet. I only drank half and brought the other half home for later enjoyment. The burger was good, but super messy. It had a mess of onions, bbq sauce, cheese, and egg on it.... things were falling out all over the place. This place could use more sturdy buns for their more messy burgers. Anyway, the flavor was good and overall I enjoyed it. Also, the price was right at only 7$ for the burger and 1$ for the egg (wow, way less than expected), 5.50 for the shake (but worth every penny....). I would come back if I were in the neighborhood.",

We got the Buffalo burger and the jalapeno burger.  The jalapeno burger was excellent.  The Buffalo burger just didn't make sense.  It lacked cohesiveness.  There was Franks Hot sauce, bacon and blue cheese.  It all sounds great on paper, but once on the place, it really didn't do anything for us.  The beer selection is great and they serve the beer in a 19oz schooner for $5.50.  I hear it's $4 at HH.  WHAT?!!!  Craft beer at that price?  Please make your way out to SoCal!  My wife ended lunch with a salted caramel shake to go.  It was heaven!  We will be back when in AZ.  Come to SoCal.  Seriously.",

It seems odd to me that there was no attempt to get fries to sell at a burger joint. After getting to our table we ordered beer and one of our party never received his. The service tonight was sub par as a manager never checked on us nor attempted to rectify any of our concerns. I think the most disappointing part was that we came here for a birthday dinner.",

Their french fries are fantastic (order them with green chile queso), their burgers are delicious, & they make a delightful milkshake in a dozen different flavors.

The bun, lightly toasted breast of an angel resting gently on the sassy and BBQ sauces below. Flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then, an onion! The most playful little onion, caramelized and flavorful. Then a slice of cheddar, lettuce, tomato and a patty of ground beef so exquisite. Swirling in your mouth breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweet and savory so delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin. This is God, speaking to us through food. --Marshall from HIMYM (kind of).  Walking in to Hopdoddy, it was clear this was no ordinary burger joint.  It's a hip, modern building with a bar in the middle and tables all around, including a lovely patio.  At first we were confused, but luckily the Burger Bouncer to the rescue!  He explained the process, handed us a menu, a table number, and sent us to the line.  By the time we reached the front we had decided...we both chose the Goodnight Burger, mine without the jalapeno.  We ordered a small order of fries on the side to share, a fountain drink, handed over our table number, and paid there at the counter.  The fountain drinks...a selection of main root sodas in various flavors; some familiar, some new.  I saw bright drinks on other tables in pink, green and blue.  I chose the mexicans cola and was quite pleased.  For my water-drinking fiance, there was carbon filtered water though I'm not sure what that means.  Right behind that were two disposal cans, one for recyclables and one for compost.  I'm not sure if the general public is able to discern compostables (saw someone putting the dredges of a milkshake in there) but I appreciate the effort!  Finally, the service was impeccable.  Everyone we encountered was super friendly and personable.  The team here works like a well-oiled machine, using teamwork and efficiency to keep everyone happy without missing a beat.    My only regret is that this restaurant is pretty far.  It will certainly be on my mind when we are in the neighborhood though.  The cocktail menu looked awfully intriguing!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Hopdoddy, and really hope they expand throughout the valley. My first time here was at a tasting event sponsored by Yelp, I was able to taste most of what was on the menu including their burgers, salads, shakes and cocktails. I went in expecting this place to be good, since I'm a huge fan of their sister restaurant Salty Sow and it definitely met my expectations.   The setup makes your dining experience very easy and laid back. You walk in and order at the counter. Don't worry if the line is too long, the servers will come around with samples to make up for it. Once you order your seat will be assigned to you, and your food will be served to you there. If you want anything else such as more drinks or dessert you can order it from your server. This process makes for a very relaxed dining experience.   As for the food, my favorites are the ahi tuna burger. The burger has sushi grade tuna with a delicious wasabi sauce and crunchy sprouts. If you like fish this is a must try! Even though this is a burger place, I really love their Hail Caesar salad. This is a modern take on the traditional caesar as it includes crunchy fried chickpeas, potato hay and a delicious dressing. I absolutely love their Parmesan truffle fries, it's worth coming here for these alone! The fries are full of flavor with truffle oil, parmesan and garlic and comes with an amazing aioli type dipping sauce.  Another added plus is all of their awesome drink options. They have a soda fountain that includes all types of fun flavors such as blueberry and cream soda. They also offer plenty of local craft beer options, and I haven't had a cocktail that I didn't like. My favorite is their version of the Jon Daily which is called the Soco Sweet Tea, if you like Arnold Palmers this is the cocktail for you! Hopdoddy is a welcome addition to the Phoenix area, the only downside is that's it's a little far from where I live. However it's still worth the drive and won't stop me from returning.",

The burgers were great but the fries were a little soggy for my liking. Also, the cheese dip for the fries was way too thick. I could barely dip the fries hence the sogginess! I would not recommend the fries with the cheese. Otherwise, I would have given a 5 star.",

Everything has fancy catchy names and they don't serve regular soda. They offer their own versions made with real sugar instead of high fructose stuff. I am OK with regular industry soda, but it tasted like a mix between pepsi and RC cola. Worked great for me. Their frys were super fancy too with sprinkling of green stuff, some kind of herb. They were perfect and came out as an appetizer. This is perfect for me as I usually eat most of my fries before my burger. The hamburgers seemed small, but totally satisfied my appetite. The flavor was AMAZING, and worth the $35 price for 2.",

    "text": "There have been an abundance of new burger and beer bars that have popped up recently in the valley.  Hopdoddy is riding that trend, along with filling a burger gap  in the Scottsdale-Shea area after the closure of Indulge Burger.    The concept here is simple: walk in and get greeted by hostess, read menu,  stand in line, (order drink as you pass the bar if you want), order burger, be seated, receive burger.    QUICK TIP:  If you sit at the bar you don't have to wait in line!   I rather enjoyed my vegetarian sandwich and I'm not even a vegetarian ;)  The La Bandita (Black Bean-Corn Patty, Avocado, Goat Cheese, Arugula, Cilantro Pesto, Chipotle Mayo on Whole Wheat) was quite de-lish.    Sides do NOT come with the burgers.  The fries baskets are very \"splitable\" and are crispy and savory.  Waitresses/bartenders provide regular ketchup and house-special chipotle ketchup.    Also, there are several beers on tap including a few fun seasonal options.    Great vibe, tasty food, and a friendly staff at fair prices.  Check it out!",

Just like when I walked in the door. My wife and I walk in the door. I see two people waving their arms. I figure that's where I go. When at the counter I state I want fries and a beer. She replies, \"If you get a burger with the beer it's only $10.\" I'm in! Now I go look for a place to sit. But I haven't paid anything. How does anyone know where I'm sitting? Where do I go? A server says, \"where are you sitting?\" \"I dunno.\" What if I sit over there?\" \" You can't sit there you sit at 23.\" WTF is 23? What if I want to sit at 47 or 51 or whatever as long as it's open? We sit somewhere. Amazingly our food comes and it's correct. How did they know where we sat? We are out of water. My wife gets up to get water twice. No one comes around to see if you need anything, you just go seek what you need; weird. Our bill comes. Who do we pay? How much to tip? No one did us any favors that's for sure. I didn't pay when ordering, there is no cashier. WTF? The bill is wrong. Order taker lady said a beer and burger was $10. They charged $15. WTF? My wife goes up to question the bill, \"sorry the server didn't get the bill right.\" WHAT? The server had nothing to do with the bill. Your bullshit excuse shouldn't be placed on the server having nothing to do with the transaction. They argue over the bill. Why do they have to argue? They told us one thing and delivered another, bait and switch; no argument should have been had period.  This place is F'd up. I'm a local and won't go back. I will pride myself in the length at which I will discourage anyone from going here, it is my duty as a consumer. No good words will come from my mouth for certain.",

How do you know where to go?).   Moving past that part.... my burger was waiting for me when I got there. If was PERFECT. Cooked perfectly, super tasty and left me wanting more! (Not because I was hungry but because it was so good, um HELLO super yummy yellow sauce) The fries were tasty, too.   Didn't have the space in my calorie count that day for a shake, but we'll be back. Definitely will be back.  Gave them 4 stars because their ordering/sitting process seems stupidly more complicated than it should. The concept doesn't make sense at all, and then seeing where the counter is located (passed the bar and into the back of the restaurant) it makes even less sense. The staff were all VERY nice, or at least the ones that I saw at the table.",

Not to mention that you get to choose rather to have gluten-free buns or regular buns-both look amazing. What really set this place apart from any burger joints that I've been to in the past is that they offer a wide selection of beer to your meal. I ended up getting the Summer Road Trip by a Brewery Company from Flagstaff called \"Mother Road Brewery\". All their burgers are delicious. If you love spicy foods, I'd recommend the El Diablo Burger. SO MUCH HEAT AND FLAVOR! And what good would it be without their signature Parmesan Fries? One last thing, they offer four different condiments for the fries. ALL OF THEM ARE AWESOME! If I could, I would give this place a 6/5. Definitely check these guys out if your in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

But that's not a server that can take your order, well they can take your drink order, and they'll bring you your food along with whatever else you need, but you still need to order your food at the counter. WTF? I don't get it, just let them take orders. Actually I do get it, they don't allow them to take your order because they are pretty lackluster when it comes to actually getting around to seeing if you need anything.

I really enjoyed the burger but thought the fries could have been better.  I also wish they were listening when I asked for no onions, since I ended up with what seemed like a half of a whole onion in the burger.  Other than that, would probably visit next time I'm in town.",

I just think that it is crazy to charge $6 for a shake, a drink that is an average size and doesn't even have alcohol in it. The ordering system was weird. My husband really loved this place, but I guess the just missed the mark for me. I guess with all the hype about this place, I had higher expectations. I am willing to try it again.",

    "text": "This place is amazing. The experience usually starts in line where the friendly staff greats you, offers you drinks, as well as answers any questions about the menu you may have so you are ready to order when you get to the counter. Their beers are served in giant frozen glass goblets that are awesome! Everything on the menu is amazing especially the truffle fries and milkshakes. Goodness gracious they know how to cook a fantastic burger!  Pro Tip: They don't make reservations, first come first serve, for the best experience keep your party small (4) because they will separate you when you party gets up there in size.",

However, once you do get in, the food is really excellent. I got the llano poblano burger which I highly recommend. Everything was high quality from the bun to the bacon on top. But the real show stopper here: TRUFFLE FRIES. At first, the thought of paying $6 for fries was utterly disturbing to me, but when my boyfriend and I saw the size of the portion, we were cool with sharing a batch.  EAT THE TRUFFLE FRIES. IF YOU DO NOT EAT ANYTHING ELSE, THAT IS OK. BUT EAT THOSE FRIES. Side note: the guy who stood outside the door to greet customers and hand out menus was wearing a shirt that said \"burger bouncer\" and I thought it was awesome.",

    "text": "I think if the walk up counter was gone this place would do a lot better. Waiting in line was not too fun. The person in front of us had a larger modified ticket and was totally annoying to listen to..we  did tip the counter staff and server. We were approached too many times asking if everything was \"good\" . Burgers were good but first basket of fries was a pile of crumbs. For $6 a basket, there should be fries not crumbs. They were replaced fast but the guy did look offended. I think the service staff really reallyyyy wanted to make a impression so they would get tipped. ( kinda like a buffet, servers hope they get something ) Six plus times asking if something was \"good \" was overboard. I think if it was just a regular restaurant without the counter it would keep The servers more busy and they would not be stressing if someone was going to tip or not. I do not like being interrupted every bite I take lol.   Burgers were good so don't worry on that part!",

    "text": "My family and I came here for dinner. The food and service is 5 stars but the way you order and are seated is a bit weird which is why we gave it 4 stars. When you walk in you are assigned a table and then proceed to the counter to order your food and drinks. After you place your order you don't pay but proceed to your table. Once seated a server comes up and ask if they can bring you any sauces or get you the fountain drinks which you already have the cup for. That was the only peculiar thing. Their dipping sauces are awesome. My brother had the el diablo burger but if you cannot handle heat/spice this burger is not for you. His lips were burning. The other burgers that we consumed were the Buffalo bill, la bandita, and their special green eggs and ham. All were excellent choices. Tasty and unique from any other burgers we have had. Fresh ingredients too which was a plus. Their milkshakes were also out of this world. You are given a thick non collapsible straw that allows for thick delicious milkshakes. All and all a great restaurant with awesome food. We will return.",

I will say that the Truffle fries were delicious but the cake batter shake was not, it was way too sweet so we didn't drink it. The burger was really small for $12. Zinburger is so much better and you get more for your money.",
