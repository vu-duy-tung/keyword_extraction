If all you can order late night is fried food after 10pm then close your doors at 10pm. I ended up going to Buffalo Wild Wings instead, the place is open until 2am and surprise...the kitchen is open until 2am. Shocking concept.",

I've tried this place 3 times and still very inconsistent with all the wings when you eat them   Cool that you can get all these different flavors but wish the meat would be more moist.   Service wasn't bad at all so atleast they have that.   Also they have the UFC fight be they charge a admission which is kind of stupid IMO. And you have to spend a certain amount during the fight. Wtf is that, this place is cheap as hell  I won't be back and I go to a real bar to watch the fights without having to pay.",

After we were sat down the server told us that they we're only serving wings and appetizers.  Ok, so we ordered our drinks.  When she brought our drinks she then told us that we can only order fried items and no flat breads.  Mind you, they say they are open until 11pm.  If you don't want to cook after 10pm then close at 10pm.  I was pissed!!!  Went to Native Grill but couldn't order anything from the grill.  Just doesn't make sense.  We just left!!!  I do not recommend this place at all!!!",

Very cheap move on the part of the waitress to try and raise the check. I've been a server before, so I always tip 20%, even with this bad service. So word of advice to the waiters here: don't charge your customers for something you very clearly word as \"that comes with three sliders. What side do you want\" in very immature attempts to raise the check price and earn more. Way to steal money from your customers.",

I'm not sure if management has completely changed or what, but it's clear that there is very little if any training being provided to servers and hostesses here.  The hostess told us it would be 5 mins to be seated in a nearly empty dining area, then another hostess came up and asked for our name and told the other hostess that she needs to ALWAYS get a name - not sure why there was a wait or why the correction needed to happen in front of customers.  Our waitress last night couldn't seem to find time to check on us unless it was to ask if we wanted to order anything else - and it wasn't busy.  We ordered loaded tots and didn't as much as get ketchup delivered with them.  The next time we saw her was when our wings came out (maybe 2-3 mins later) at which time we had to ask for ranch and told it was an extra charge (fine, whatever).  1 ranch for 12 wings... okay.  We had to ask for a refill on a soda and a water to go with a beer, which is odd to me since that's like Serving 101.  At the end of it all, I had to ask for the promotional card thing that was being given to customers this weekend.  I got 1.  At a table for 2. (I verified the \"rules\" were one card per person per table).  When she dropped it off she was almost sarcastic saying \"here's that card you wanted...\".   My husband said it best \"This is the McDonald's of wings.\"  It gets the job done but not well.  Seriously, go anywhere else.  Anywhere.",

Tonight we came in and experienced some of the worst host service from the moment we walked in. A new person was in the front- when we approached him he looked stunned that we were asking for a table for 2 on a Friday night and proceeded to recommend that we find seating in the bar area because it would be a 'long wait' for the dining area. We chose to put in our name and take our chances.  In the next 20 min we sat and watched him proceed to dissuade people from staying at the restaurant and had 17 people walk back out when he went from a 10 min wait to a 30 min wait and the last people he turned away he had told it would be an hour and 1/2 wait. Within minutes of that party walking out our table was ready and we walked into the dining area to see 9 booths open, 3 had couples in them, 1 table was dirty and there was a party of 10-12 people at the back. We proceeded to watch him continue to steer people away from the restaurant. Sad-  We ordered their new native buffalo fries and their new jalapeno puffs- the fries were great, the jalapeno puffs were absolutely disgusting- see picture below- um cheese whiz type cheese with sliced jalapenos that they put on the nachos wrapped in an overly fried but raw pastry wrap? WTH?  We ordered our wings as usual and still love them The new layout of the bar opening up into the restaurant is dysfunctional to say the least- hoping there is a clear direction they are taking to renovate this place. 2 stars for the wings of course !",

I had the honey hot strippers and my wife had the lettuce wraps. Food was ok. I also ordered a side salad which they forgot. Our waiter was very friendly but seemed a bit overwhelmed as we overheard him apologizing for other mistakes the Kitchen had made. As we left we were ignored by the 2 hostesses looking at there phones. Overall I'd pass on the place. Food is mediocre and the service is sub par. Better options available for sure.",

During high-profile events, the restaurant can be downright hectic, and it appears that this particular grill is always a bit understaffed which only compounds the problem.  With all that on its plate, this Grill manages to have some of the nicest folk and the best food in the area. I'd like to recognize one particular associate, whose name I hope I won't butcher here -- Paula DeAnne (?) -- she is incredibly cordial and professional. I've gone in a couple times to pick up orders to find the place utterly swamped, and whenever she's there, she manages the crowd like an expert. There have been a few times where my trips to this restaurant were less-than-five-stars, but I feel if the restaurant's management capitalizes on hiring and promoting associates like her, those less-than-perfect trips will be a thing of the past.  Management, please recognize your great employees and move them up accordingly!",

There was a sign at the desk to walk around and seat yourself...so we did.  They only had seating in the bar area, but there were plenty of tables available.  We sat, and within seconds, we were handed menus and gave our drink order.  Our server was Jeanette, who was very friendly and helpful.  We hadn't been here before, so she gave us the rundown on everything.  We couldn't decide which app to go with, and she suggested the potato skins.  So glad she did, because they were really good.  We decided to get 20 honey BBQ traditional wings.  They were well-sauced and meaty.  I got the bleu cheese and hubby got the ranch.  We totally enjoyed them, and finished them off!  Jeanette was quick on refills of our iced teas, and brought over extra napkins for us.  Hubby took a look at the desserts (it's always dangerous when he does), so we ended up sharing the chocolate bundt cake.  OMG!  It was warm and moist, with hot chocolate sauce all over it...soooo good!  All in all, we really enjoyed ourselves!  We'll definitely be coming back again.",

I have been coming to Natives for well over 10 years and loved the food and most the time the service.  Tonight the service was a hair in the food and not comped and offered a birthday sundae and didn't bring it to my 10 year old son. When I asked why he didn't get his birthday sundae she said oh I didn't know you wanted one. We waited and waited for the sundae and paid $5.00 for it.  The bill was all jacked up with over charges and she said oh they comped you some items. Ummm no you over charged and took off those charges! To top it off they told us all the cooks had no hair so not sure how the wings had a hair wrapped all around a couple of my sons wings.  Nasty!!  Gross!! Rude!!  Good luck if you eat here.",

    "text": "Came here last night to grab some dinner and to watch the Mayweather fight with my brother . There was a $25 cover charge per person but it wasn't a big deal. You had to spend $15 per person per hour to retain your seat if not you got the boot. And yes we actually saw people being booted or moved. This was no problem either as I understand that they have to make money during these events. What bothered me however was that some tables only had waters and one entree and nobody bothered them the entire night.  My table however kept getting bothered every hour to order something.  I'm not sure if the people across from us knew someone at the restaurant or what  but I just found it a bit bothersome that they were lounging with their water while we had a buffet at our table.  Regardless we still managed to have a decent time. There was 2 of us at my table so we ordered a 24 piece wing platter, tater tot appetizer, 1 large meaty beast pizza, 1 buffalo chicken dip appetizer, 5 beers and 2 drinks. The wings were ok. Very small in size compared to BWW. The flavor that stood out the most was the Asian garlic and Lemon pepper. The tater tots were delicious and crispy. The meaty beast pizza was thin and just ok. Very salty, lots of sauce and i didn't care for the bacon on the pizza. The service was decent but I asked for a refill on my soda and the waitress dissapeared and never came back. It wasnt until she brought me the bill that she remembered my drink. The fight was whack, the ambience just ok so overall experience nothing special.  I don't think I'll be coming back to Native anytime soon unless I'm craving tater tots.",

    "text": "I am going to give thumbs up for the service here and  a resounding \"meh\" on the food for this Native New Yorker location.  Most of the credit is due to the wait staff for finding space for our group of about 30 on a Sunday night when the NBA finals were on. Service was by no means perfect, but again, credit where credit is due. This was a fairly picky group and I did not hear many complaints about the service. The server split up the checks according to our requests and made sure we knew that the gratuity was included on each of our bills due to the large party. Some servers will conveniently leave out that fact  Now on to the critique of the food. This is based solely on the food I tasted or the food for my family on my own check.  Wings: supposedly they are famous for this, but the best comment I heard was \"they are better than Applebees\"... not such a ringing endorsement. I tried a couple and thought they were small and dry.  I had the Reuben. It was standard fare and nothing more. Not memorable. Wife had a salad, which she said was OK. My daughters both had the Fettuccine Alfredo, which is what they order whenever possible. They said it was OK but the chicken was dry.  I will give them props for the service. I don't think I will be in a huge hurry to go back for the food.",

I'm a skinny guy - 6' tall 165ish. I had to sit \"side saddle\" to feel somewhat comfortable. For those who don't know what that means, I had to sit SIDEWAYS with my legs on the seat, and my feet hanging off the end.   The atmosphere was devoid of life, and completely drained of energy. There were two other tables seated in the section.   The waitress had no idea what beers they offered, and had to read off a list. She also had no clue if they offered any season selections that might of had fruit flavoring of any kind.  When she came back from \"investigating\", she said they offered a hard apple cider. I ordered one along with an Italian beef. I've worked for a NNY in the past, and thought it to be a safe bet - bread, meat, cheese, au jus, fries. The sandwich could of been taken out of the salamander sooner, as the top had some burning to it.  My friend had boneless wings - I'm not even going to waste time talking about deep fried, frozen commercial \"meat chunks\".   I don't go out to eat very often, but I do work as a chef. In aware of the difference between a horrible-great place is; I've worked for all in-between.  I knew I was in for low quality food, but for as DEAD as it was, I'd expected to see them at the top of their game.  This was mediocre at best.  At least the hard apple cider was good.",

The waitress was very attentive, the wings came out fast. The wings were very good. I recommend the strawberry hot wings. And if you just want to try a few wings, they sell them individually! The burger was also cooked perfectly. My hubby and I split the burger and a dozen wings. They even split the burger and divided it on two plates. I would highly recommend this place for lunch!",

After all that was figured out we each ordered a glass of ice water and a 2 orders of wings. 1/2 pound BBQ boneless and 1/2 pound hot boneless.   What did I end up paying for 2 waters, 5 tasteless hot wings, and 6 cold BBQ wings? I paid almost $30.   When I asked why is was so high the waiter simply said to pay it and he'd explain afterword.

When you asked me if I wanted a box for the nine dollar calzone I'd only picked at because it tasted like something out of a rotten Lunchable, and I grimaced and shook my head no, it was because I couldn't imagine it tasting any better another day later. You said \"you didn't like it?\" and then disappeared for another 25 minutes to go shoot the shit with your co-workers, who were also on the clock. I, mistakenly thought you were possibly talking to your manager to redress the situation, or maybe thinking of something else to bring. Instead, you didn't ask if I wanted anything else and still put it on my bill.   Any of the food that takes skill to make here is a POS. Sure, my dinner salad was fine, but you can't really go wrong with lettuce and dressing. Everyone I went with, myself included, felt ill after eating here.   I don't even know how this place is still in business and I wish it wasn't. What a hell hole.",

The wings were big and juicy and the sauces had just the right tang. We would definitely be repeat customers if we lived here!",

Was very happy to see a UFC fight on TV when I got there....until they turned off the audio to play music that the staff liked.  She must have seen the shocked look on my face when the fight audio was stopped mid fight, and said...\"you don't mind do you...that we put music on? The place was empty and she new I was kinda like WTF because she asked if I cared... I just grinned/nodded, paid my tab, left 3/4 of my Guinness on the table and went to Twin Peaks where the service is OUTSTANDING and they have every fight and to sport known to man on about 75 TVs. However, the wings were outstanding! Atmosphere was  kinda OK, but the place was almost empty at 9pm on a Sunday night. If you want wings, get them for take-out...you will not be disappointed. Ultimately, I was not inconvenienced too much by it...but since it was business travel, I can tip heavily....which I did not do tonight....I left 1/3 of what I could have, so switching to music cost my waitress (the one who switched to music) about $12...I hope it was worth it.  And I won't go back when I come here again...which will be quite frequent from now on, until I retire in 20 years.  Tips are based on service and experience which she had full control of and squandered it. I wish waitresses understood this today. They expect a tip but don't don't want to work hard to get it anymore...",

We were notified that the food was done, and had been done for about 10 minutes. Since we live close, we were there to pick up the food right on time. We were shocked when we arrived and had to wait another 40 MINUTES only to carry out cold wings to the point where the sauce had coagulated and a half filled box of cold, yes, COLD fries. When we asked the server that was waiting to bring our food out what was going on she replied- \"I don't know, they're all here\" referring to the kitchen. We have both worked in the industry- there is no excuse for 50+ minute wings when your restaurant is dead and a half-full box of cold fries. Presentation was sloppy and there was no acknowledgment of our wait or ruined dinner. Save your money.",

Strike 1 I asked for dry rub salt and pepper wings 15 when they came out 8 had no seasoning and were tough like they may have been days old.

I think she was sampling the beer in the back she couldn't do anything right. My partner didn't even leave a tip. And I left a small amount. Sorry this location has been weak in the customer service side in the few other times I have come out for lunch or dinner. Like the wait staff could care less if they are there or not.

I grabbed my beer and smashed it. I asked our server politely for the manager. When the manager Amanda came up she said hi and I told her politely that we had a cockroach on our table and that i had killed it with my beer glass. She said \"I am so sorry. Were you guys planning on leaving?\" I told her no then she brought me another beer. Right then I should had left! I have been in the hospitality business for many years. If I was a manager I would automatically think to tell my guest... \"I apologize for the inconvenience, would you like to be seat else where, We will go ahead and take care of your food tonight\" or at least something to make me happy. Amanda asked again were you guys planning on leaving and I said \"no, but is there anything you can do for us?\" At this point I was turned off by her management skills. Amanda clearly said \"what would work for you?\" I was shocked and speechless! I asked her if there was anyway for her to give us a discount. There was no management skills in this person what so ever. We got 25% off and she never came back to the table to see how everything was going. Amanda walked in front of us twice after the fact. It takes one minute to ask how the rest of our dinner was going. Bad Management at this place. I recommend finding a new manager!",

So today, hubby wanted some wings so I called to place an order so I can pick it up on my way home from work. The woman answered I said I would like to place an order for pickup then the line went dead.  I called again, the woman answered I said I would like to place an order for pickup and the line went dead again.  This happened 2 more times. 4 in total. I called again (glutton for punishment) and a male answered I said I would like to place an order for pickup, he said ok then I asked him if they were having a problem with their phone line because I was hung up on 4 times.  The guy said no no problem with the phone line then I said well I may have been hung up on.  He said well lets just move on what is your order.  At this point I no longer wanted to do business with them and I decided not to order.",

This place still needs to make major improvements on the front greeting desk - they stil seem clueless many times.",

It was nice that it wasn't busy for lunch today, and one would think that the service from ordering our food to actually receiveing it would be reasonable shorter than the hour it took to get 2 burgers. Come on Native, really, an hour for 2 burgers? And, my order was not correct as I asked for a lettuce wrapped burger and it was delivered on a bun. The egg was overcooked, the dinner salad I paid extra for in place of fries, had so many tomatoes and shredded cheese it made it unpalatable.   As for the service...our person I'm sure is a nice guy, but doesn't active listen otherwise my order would have come out correct. What a shame, this place has gone down hill so much that I/we will never be back. If there was an option to rate a zero, I would have provided that as the score. Now we sit, with finished dishes on our table waiting to be cleared and for our bill, well after the last check in to see if we wanted dessert. Is it really difficult to carry two tables bills at one time? The table that was seated after us, have already ate, paid and left. Wow!   Oh wait, our server just stopped by to ask if we wanted to hang out for a while or get our tab...um, check please! We have to leave and cannot sit here all day, thanks Aaron and bye-bye.",

If the manager, Jake, had any common sense he would've granted an exception and made an effort since he'd neglected to mention his kitchen was closed when we spoke on the phone. Secondly, what kind of family establishment completely shuts down their kitchen a full hour before they close?? (NO common sense from the top down!)  My ONLY other experience there was equally as bad. Asked to have our wings GRILLED at \"Native GRILL & Wings\".. Met with an adamant \"we don't do that\". Maybe this place should change their name to Native JERK Chicken?? Needless to say, we won't be back.",

We expressed to the waitress that it was our first time and we asked for recommendations as to what was the best flavor between two different wings. She explained to us her favorite, however, my partner still could not decide so she asked to taste the sauce. They had no problem bringing out a sample of the sauce.   We decided on our flavor of wings (partner got the honey hot and the honey chipotle wing, and I got the salt and pepper dry rub and the hot honey mustard).  We also ordered fries and tots. We were there during the lunch time so everything we ordered was discounted.   OMG!!!! Being from Atlanta, Home of the best Wings, I had no idea what to expect from a wing place in Arizona. The wings were very delicious. They were some of the best wings I had ever eaten. The tots and the fries were seasoned just right and they came out hot and fresh. My partner could not eat her wings because they were too hot for her. She was trying to be brave today when she knows she is not a hot person. Lol. The waitress noticed that she did not eat her wings and offered to change the flavor of her wings so she could enjoy them. I find that to be very accommodating and customer focused. I will definitely support Native for the duration of our stay in Arizona.   We also had the white chocolate macadamia Cookie for dessert. Yummy!!!!  Please give them a try for yourself before you judge them on the negative reviews.",

    "text": "Came here for wing night, but was extremely disappointed. The quality of the food wasn't bad, but I have a legitimate concern with the cleanliness of the restaurant. My family sat in a booth near the kitchen. After we ordered appetizers, I felt something run across my foot. When I looked down I saw a huge roach  crawling over to the other table. My husband jumped up and killed it before it crawled on someone else, but needless to say I was completely grossed out. The waitress came over and asked if everything was okay. We told her what happened and she apologized and offered to move us to another table. We moved seats and the wings came out. Shortly after the manager came over and apologized for what had happened. She explained that the restaurant was sprayed a few days earlier and made it seem as though this was a common issue. She stated that she was going to call the corporate office tomorrow  and for me to call her if I had any questions. The manager did take 50% off our bill, which was appreciated, but didn't change the fact that I just had a freaking roach crawl on my foot. I think the more appropriate thing to do would have been to comp the entire bill. I will never eat at this establishment again and hope no one else has to experience this. My family eats out often and I can say I have NEVER experienced this before. The restaurant has an A rating, but I'm not convinced that would be the same if a roach crawled on the inspector.",

    "text": "I wish there was a way to give 1/2 stars.   I visited this afternoon with my husband and son. Drinks at least came quickly. We ordered asiago cheese chips (the only decent part of the meal for me) and the server tried to walk away before my husband could order his suicide wings.   ***Side note #1. Someone that finds jalapenos hot, should not be able to comfortably finish a suicide wing. It was hot, but the Heart Attack at Yen Sushi is hotter.  Instead of clearing the empty dishes first, she came out with a tray, and rather than coming the extra 3 feet around the table, held my Kummelweck sandwich in my face across the table until I took it.  ***Side note #2. Holding a bun under tap water and smooching seeds with regular salt on it prior to serving, is not the way to make a Kummelweck bun. I can understand the bottom of the bun being already disintegrated from the beef holding water and spilled Ah Jus when I got the plate, but the top bun should not only not be cold and soggy, my hand shouldn't look covered in wet sand after I put it down.   ***Side note #3. Au Jus should not have more grease than broth.  I'd requested a salad, which wasn't brought out with dinner. The leaves were slimy, the tomato was rotten and the cheese looked like it had been living there for a few days.   My sons sliders meal was ok. At least this time you could see the meat on the sandwich. My husbands burger was ok, but didn't feel so hot afterwords.    The only positive point from this experience was the asiago cheese chips.  Lack luster, lazy server, plus substandard food. Definitely won't be back.",

They can't decide who our server is, 5 mins, 6 mins, 7 mins go by... and right at about 10 mins. someone is our server. 3.  Menu says Sam Adams on draft.  Turns out, after a long wait, there is no Sam Adams on tap and we order again. 4.  Potato chips were delayed because they did not have any pre-made chips.  They arrived with the main meal. 5.  Kitchen staff was joking around, girls screaming, almost as if it was a little Spring Break party inside and everyone could hear them. 6.  Calzone was ice cold in the middle.  Frozen ricotta cheese? 7.  Pizza was burnt on the top.  No, you're not supposed to have those black circular splotches on the cheese. 8.  Just a few casual apologies from the teenage waiter for the above.  No manager apology, no \"comped\" items, nothing.  This place seems like it was transplanted from some dopey college campus where every customer is 21 or under and just comes here to get drunk, regardless of food quality, service, and the time it takes to get food.  Native New Yorker is a failure.  I regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously, since NNY has a clear trend towards the low end of things, at this location and on Bell.",

But the waitress,  Brandi  ,  rocked and kept those things that could be kept in motion moving.  First I have to go off on the wings. I am  tired of promises of impending immolation  or  later cauterization  of hemorrhoids  only to be served up  \"weak sauce\" wings  that are  about as challenging as balancing a brick  in the center of a pool table.   Wing sauce was  also salty as hell.  Wings are a good size and taste good in their own right just  embarrassing that   news of my suicide turned  out to in error.  In this case  for anyone used to hot thai food suicide really is painless   Main course.  Burgers,   Pretty good,  generous on the fries, baked potatoes. Was  good enough   but this is more sustenance than sublime .   Partner  had  tenderloin sliders which were pretty  good meat wise, once you found it , but the buns are way too big for the task and you can't  really enjoy it as a burger but   hopefully someone just mismatched the bread types today.  If not this  dish is huge fail.   Kid's meal was  great value and HUGE  we  are used to   mini hot dogs and string  fries  . Prices hold with a Chilis / Applebees type  location.   Pleasant enough an the  menu has main sections for pizza, pasta, burgers, steak and wings as the main themes plus  the obligatory salads.  If it wasn't next to Cabelas, an I wasn't ravenous for \"anything\"  I could miss this place. Not   I really  want to give it 2.5 stars but have rounded it up.",

She turns around and was like take a seat anywhere to the left. We took a seat and then waited for 10 minutes. I got up to use the rest room around the time a booth next to us finished up. By the time I come back there are new guests there and someone is serving them... I asked my boyfriend. If someone had taken out order and he said no. When that waitress was finished taking the new booths order my boyfriend flagged her down and she just put her hand up and was like \"I'm getting your menus and your server\"... then we waited for another 5 minutes and I had enough. We just walked out.... we have even ordered from her numerous times and the food is always late. I took my dad here last month and they served us cold food, I made hem remake it...

Native Grill & Wings is located in Arizona, Texas, and Illinois. Seat yourselves and order! This location seems a bit more hectic than some of the other locations I've been to across the valley and they could definitely use a few more bussers and waitstaff. Nonetheless, the food seems consistent with their other locations.  Still a better wing place than the place across the street at Westgate, my usual go-tos at Native Grill & Wings are the Strawberry Hot wings and the Asiago Parmesan wings. I love them both and you can't make me choose which is better. I'm not sure if I ever had their pizza but on this recent trip with my pal, we both ordered two separate pizzas and they were both salty as heck. Ain't no demons around Native Grill & Wings given how much salt is in their food alone. Whoa!  So yeah, 3-stars!  \"A-OK\" for an okay place. I'll be sticking with the wings and salad.",

I like to give places a chance, though and on a recent visit to AZ, our friends asked if we wanted to meet up here for 69 cent wings which is their special on Tuesdays.  I am a girl who loves her wings, so I thought this would be a good way to check out the flavor options here, so we met up our friends for dinner.    The building from outside looks quite large and when you enter, it is.  There were large rooms for dining with tvs everywhere to watch sports.  The 69 cent wing special was for traditional bone-in wings, which is my preference, so was happy about that.  There were a lot of flavors to choose from. Since they were so cheap, we decided we might as well try all the flavors that intrigued us, so we ordered away.  They were set up on the menu from mild to hot, so that was helpful.  Some unique dry rub and sauce flavors indeed.  We ordered a variety to include Chicken & Waffles, Strawberry Hot Wings, Honey BBQ, Salt & Pepper, Asiago Parmesan, and Buffalo Ranch.  They were all good, but my absolute favorite flavors were the Strawberry Hot Wings which are their signature sweet heat wings, Buffalo Ranch which were a dry rub that were ranchy and had a slow burn and the Salt & Pepper which were just like they said (I am a big salt and pepper anything fan so these were a given).   We also ordered the loaded fries that were like the toppings on a loaded baked potato or skins and these were awesome.    The place was crowded but not packed and our server was really nice but she seemed to be tending to a lot of tables and booths.  We had to flag her down a couple of times to get drink refills and place an extra order for more wings.  Since it wasn't a big sports night, the place probably would have been more packed if it was in the middle of basketball or football season.  We marveled at how many wings we got considering they were 69 cents each.  I would definitely come back on a Tuesday when back in AZ to get this deal again.",

Made it a Tuesday night tradition with my young family and enjoyed 50 cent wings every week.  Haven't been in awhile but got a raise today and was craving Native wings.  Walked in tonight thinking I wouldn't find a seat due to MNF. The place was empty to my surprise. Low energy vibe.  Ordered my favorite wings in the 10 pack and had great service. I got my wings and they were awful. Old and dry, seemingly resurrected from a heat lamp. Two limp celery as a side but no carrots. The quality and atmosphere is sad and dead.",

She took extremely long with our drink orders. Forgot to put in our food order and came by to check on us every 45 mins or longer and makes a comment such as 'you drink fast', I wanted to say, 'no, you're just slow'   We ordered two half dozens of wings. (Teriyaki and chicken and waffles) But after almost 5 hours and between the 3 of us we were still hungry. We didn't want to order anymore food there because of the horrible service and the thought of having to wait an hour for the food. After the fight we chose to dine elsewhere for dinner.

    "text": "Wasn't a huge fan.   We went here on the first night of our excursion to see our Eagles get plucked by the Cardinals last weekend.  My brother wanted to watch the UFC fights and found out this place gets the PPVs.   We each paid a $5 cover charge which didnt seem too bad and sat on the patio as the inside was packed.  It was very hot out and their misting system was a little shaky all night.   When they finally got it turned on after a short while, mist (well, we all hope it was mist) came out pouring over all of us and our drinks.  My dad questioned whether it was mist or dust as the system seemed somewhat antiquated.  A short period of time later the system started emanating HEAT from it, which was about the last thing any of us needed, like running up to someone who was drowning and throwing a brick at them for good measure.  My brother ended up climbing up and disconnecting the heat plug under supervision of another employee, which the possibilities caused me to have flashbacks to my Business Law college courses.  I ordered a club sandwich with no cheese since I didn't want to start my vacation on an upset stomach.  Upon the delivery the waitress repeated the order as she handed me my plate of food \"One club sandwich with no cheese\"    30 seconds later I was picking cheese off of each and every quarter of it.   Even more annoying, sometimes I'd peel of the cheese and have to HUNT for the meat.   I kid you not, one of them had maybe half of an average SLICE of turkey on it.  THAT'S IT.   So there was bread, lettuce, tomato, unwanted cheese, and half a slice of turkey.   If you've seen me you know I don't look like Fiona Apple, so I'd like more than 2-3 slices of meat TOTAL on my sandwich please.  The fries were okay (I substituted the steak fries for curly), but nothing you can't get elsewhere.  The only saving grace for the experience was the waitress who was extremely friendly, efficient, and refilled the drinks constantly.  Prices were average unless you consider that club sandwich probably had $.75 worth of fixings, and I'm certain it cost more than that.  1 star for the food, bumped up to a 2 for the service.",

The bar side was busy and yet they got service within 15 minutes of getting seated. Another family sat next to use and they got served with their appetizers before ours even came out. When our food came out it wasn't even fresh or hot it was warm and it felt like it was sitting there for awhile. My wings was warm my daughter Mac and cheese was warm and her tater tots taste like it was a day old and my husband burger was not medium well done and it was dry and semi-cold that he couldn't even enjoy it. Basically I felt like they were favoring other customers I mean we are paying customer too. I take it personally when my 5 year old starts to ask mommy where is my food and it take an hour for her food and I specifically told them I want hers dinner to come out first. So 1 star for poor customer service and lack of attention to the customer orders and recommendations.",

    "text": "My hotel was horribly located and had no amenities (Spring Hill) so the only room service was a delivery from this place.  I held off ordering but on the 3rd day in town I broke down (I don't like ordering off site- unless it's pizza). I ordered boneless wings and a rack of ribs (lunch and dinner).  I declined paying extra for a salad when asked.  The food arrived very promptly, even though I ordered during the lunch hour, and the young woman who brought it had a BIG smile...not a perturbed look like most delivery persons! The ribs didn't have the sauce on them, which I like but I know some people don't.  The sides were very minimal (I counted 11 steak fries)!  I should have ordered the salad.  The wings were their \"hot\" flavor but barely had spice to them.  I would say it was a mild sauce (I usually order medium). All of the food was barely warm on arrival. Finally, they were kind enough to give me plenty of plasticware and condiments. Improvements: simplify your LARGE menu, offer sauce on the side for wings, and use foil in to go orders.",

I ordered the BBQ chicken burger with steak fries, and a chocolate cheesecake.   Disgusting.  It took about 35 minutes for the food to arrive (not bad). The food that I received was awful. The menu says (I have it in front of me lol):  \"Topped with our BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, signature onion strings and leaf lettuce.\" The chicken tasted pretty good. The lettuce was wilted, the onions were greasy and gross, and there was NOOOO cheese!! Cheese is everything! GAH!   Cheesecake....with whipped cream?? The whipped cream was ALL melted when it was delivered! EW. OBVIOUSLY it was going to melt on the way to the hotel, right? So why put it on there? The menu says NOTHING about whipped cream, either. The chocolate tasted like plain ol Hersey's.   Definitely will not be eating there again, room service or dine in.",

    "text": "So needless to say Native New Yorker is definitely not the place that it used to be! In years past it was easily a better go to than many competitors but these days it's a mess! I can't speak to the quality of all food but the wings which they are known for (or at least used to be) are terrible now! I have given this particular location countless tries to see if they can get it together but I'm constantly let down. Most recently I ordered 48 wings on a weekday, midday mind you and went to pick them up. There was hardly any people in the place yet I was waiting for a waitress at the front for over 5mins then I walked around to the bar for assistance and they said they would get it boxed up and ready. So I wait another 10mins for them to bring them out and finally she brings them and I head home. I get home and what do you know the wings are soggy and very under sauced!!! I'm like really?!?!? I normally would just deal with it but I've had enough of this under performance from this establishment. So I call to see about bringing them back and getting a refund and I'm put on hold for the manager who then picks up and then hangs up. So I call right back and the manager answers the phone with no greeting other than hello....I'm like is this native New Yorker and she rudely says \"yes what can I do for you\" so I explain what's going on and she just says \"come down and we will get it figured out\". I get down there and as the manager she doesn't even have the decency to come up front and handle the situation she has the waitress running back and forth relaying messages. Being in customer service and being a manager myself I was completely thrown off by her utter disregard for making the situation right. I'm completely done with this place I will give my business to much more deserving companies!",

I had my 6-month old baby with me and we were hoping to get Togo to head on out to enjoy AZ since we are on vacation here. Right as we entered the restaurant, I received a very sad almost bored \"Hi\" from the hostess. That was it. I asked to order for takeout and she immediately asked what I wanted to order without offering me the menu. I had to ask for a menu and quickly ordered a Greek chicken salad with flatbread and 6 lemon pepper wings. The hostess gave off the vibe that she wasn't too thrilled to be here on a Saturday afternoon. After waiting for almost 20mins for the food to arrive and listening to the workers gossip at the front about the working staff, I hurried back to our hotel without checking the food. Got back and opened my salad to find just a plain Greek salad, NO Chicken, and flatbread as hard as tortilla chips.  Needless to say, I was not impressed or satisfied by my experience here, and am not coming back. On a side note, chicken wings tasted fine, but can't beat the wings at Buffalo Wild Wings.",

The server came back immediately I didn't get a chance to completely look over menu. So I asked if they had fried pickle and was told this is Not \"BWW\". So I order chips and salsa.  Food: chips and salsa were terrible. The chips were greasy and rubbery. Stall tasting. I jus wanted to finish my beer and leave.  It took so long to get my bill , the server never checked on me. I could have jus walked out.",

We were there last night for dinner at 6 PM, even though the restaurant was almost empty, we waited almost 15 minutes for a table. Once we finally got taken back we asked for a booth (we have a toddler and it's easier to contain him) and the host acted like we're were being crazy, then made us stand in he middle of the dining area while he asked someone about our request.  He then made us continue waiting while he cleaned a booth despite 4 other open clean booths in the same section. Once we were seated the waitress came over and took our drink order.  While we were waiting for drinks two other parties were seated near us, ordered, and received their drinks and we were still without even a beverage.  We decided to leave and a member of our party spoke with the manager and explained why we were leaving and the manager just said \"OK\" and watched us leave.  This experience has been the worst ever at this location, we will not be going back nor will our friend who accompanied us.    Corporate needs to get involved with this location because the management obviously doesn't know what they're doing.",

On more than one occasion I see servers standing around talking or huddling in a corner, not checking on customers, or looking like they would rather not be there (and I'm sure they don't) but that attitude reads all over your face and body language and really turns customers off...killing the entire experience.  Now when I crave wings I just order to-go and skip the drama.",

    "text": "Before you waste your time and money going here, give heed to my warnings and learn from my mistakes!  First of all, their Chickens must be on a diet.  Compared to Buffalo Wild Wings, they are about a half of the size and you need to purchase a drink at NNY in order to get the 49-cent traditional wing special price on Tuesdays & Thursdays.  As if that's not enough, my 22oz lukewarm beer was brought to me in a room-temperature glass with a curly black hair on the sipping rim.  My wife was given carbonated water without syrup when she ordered a Sprite.  As pleasant as these drinks sound, they arrived over 10 minutes after we were seated.  Maybe the delay accounts for the strategic placement of the hair between the bartender's quick restroom break and the delivery of another beer?  Perhaps not, but it sure looked like a pubic hair!  As for the flavor of the wings, be prepared to be unsatisfied (especially if you've been to Buffalo Wild Wings).  For instance, the Strawberry Hot wings taste like they are marinated in IHOP strawberry syrup and the Mandarin Orange wings taste like they are as plain as can be.  As a side note, I've also tried to come here before with a group of friends for Karaoke on Saturday night, only to be told that the Karaoke equipment wasn't working.  I'm sure there's more, but that's probably enough for you to get the picture.  If you are staying at the nearby hotels or if you are looking for something in the area, just go straight to the Yardhouse at Westgate for an unforgettable Happy Hour!  Update: I've been here a few more times for cheap beers and/ or their lousy wings.  Buffalo Wild Wings is now open at Westgate and is a much better option for wings (especially on Tuesday and Thursdays for 60 cent specials).",

We literally had to seat ourselves, grab our own menu's from the hostess stand, and the only way we even got waited on was because I probably looked like I was about to stab someone in the eyeball after waiting to be acknowledged for 15 minutes. Seriously the worst service I ever had. I used to wait tables at a sports bar, and when you have 12 seated tables, 3 waitresses, 2 bar tenders, and 2 bus boys, your patrons should not have to grab their own freaking menu's after waiting to be paid attention to for 15 minutes of sitting in a nearly empty restuarant. You seriously couldn't pay me to come back here.",

Let's start with service or let's say lack of service. Disappointing to say the least.   I ordered wings and so did my wife. Very average like everything else.

We ordered the Loaded Tots for our appetizer ...#1 it took 35 minutes before they arrived and they were not even hot. They were NOT loaded, they were very skimpy on their toppings. When our entrees arrived the food was ok but again not hot. Our waitress Kiana was very nice and checked on us a couple of times. I didn't want to complain to our waitress normally not worth it. We may not return? Wait and see. If this resturant wants to raise their Stars management needs to fix a few things.",

    "text": "Okay, since I was looking to find a quick bite after shopping at Cabela's, I decided to give this place a chance for redemption.  I admit I noticed a change in atmosphere, which is good. My party and I came in on a Tuesday which is the wing special. Service was excellent and the wings were good. But I noticed they now have some kind of rules to ordering wings now. Apparently, customers can no longer have a \"special request\" for wing orders (No sloppy and/or \"naked\" wings\". No legs only, which I've never requested.) Since it was slow enough, the server agreed to have my wings a little \"Sloppy\". I understand that wings will never go back to 39cents per wing on Tuesdays and Thursday's like the good ol' days, but limiting a customers request on they want their wings is like saying they can't have a steak cooked how they want it (IMO).  This location has improved some, and I will be back when I'm on that side of town, looking for a quick bite. But I still won't make the long trip from Tempe like I used to.",

Bacon was left off my son's burger that was ordered, but no big deal. The server immediately brought it out when my wife brought it to her attention. We ordered a little 20 pack of hot wings  ($21.59 before tax). The wings on top were crispy and fresh. The bottom half barely contained sauce as they appeared to be sitting for an extended period. One could easily tell that the wings were from a different/old batch. It's not what you'd expect when paying over a $1.07 for each overpriced wing. The remainder of the food was average. I purchased the Native burger ($10.99). Honestly. I can easily purchase a better tasting burger from a fast food restaurant. My daughter purchased the Hangover burger also $10.99. I thought that was a descent looking burger. I would recommend that you purchase the Slider Triple, if it's not a limited time special. The sliders seem to provide a better selection. Anyhow, I hope my soon does not chose this place for his 13th Birthday, as I hope to not dine here again.",
