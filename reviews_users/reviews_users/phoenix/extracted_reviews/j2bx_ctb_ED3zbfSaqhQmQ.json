Service was great and ambiance is very nice, but my meal of the chef's seafood special turned out to be just ok with small-ish mussels, a few shrimp, and very little salmon.  I got through my meal and realized it was mostly potatoes, but kept searching for more seafood!   Hubby said his chicken was delish and our guest enjoyed the fish tacos. I didn't want to embarrass or guest by complaining, but I'll stick with their delicious steaks or chicken next time.  Oh, and be warned about heavy garlic with the ceasar salad. I LOVE garlic, but it was a bit much even for me!",

    "text": "Roaring Fork was another Arizona Restaurant Week stop for me. The location is great and parking was easy to find. We were greeted by two friendly hostesses that informed us the dining room was full but we were free to look around the bar or patio. We immediately found a great spot in the bar. I personally like the bar better because it has a lot more of a relaxed atmosphere and I don't feel like I have to be so uptight. I got the tortilla soup as my first course which was very uniquely presented. It came in a bowl with the broth on the side. The soup had tortilla strips, chicken, avocado, corn, and some other tasty things and the broth was poured over everything at the table. No joke, this was probably the best I've ever had! I did not want to share! For my entree I got the sugar crusted duck (cooked rare of course). I love duck. Like, you just can't go wrong with it. The skin was crispy and flavorful and the meat was tender and delicious. It came with green chili mac & cheese which was truly one of the best things I've  had in recent memory.   I have to take a moment to talk about my dining companions steak. He ordered the ribeye medium rare and when I asked him how it was he replied \"really good but over cooked just a little bit.\" Now understand, I am a rare meat eating kind of girl and when I tried it I have to say it was one of the most flavorful steaks I've ever had! We both acknowledged how flavor almost never trumps how a steak is cooked but in this case we didn't even consider sending it back. I'm glad I tried this place through Arizona Restaurant Week and look forward to coming back and trying the rest of the menu!",

The restaurant interior (very nice) reminds me of something you'd see in a ski town  (e.g. antler chandeliers).    I had the Tortilla soup and the Rotisserie Chicken Flatbread.     The broth for the soup is actually poured tableside into a bowl piled with chicken and tortilla strips.    The chicken is excellent and the broth was flavorful but it could have been hotter.    The flatbread was very large; I would not order it again.   The cheese had an odd texture as if it wasn't real cheese.  My husband had the Big Burger which he loved but could not finish.   Unfortunately we did not have room for dessert but I'll definitely try something next time.",

HH is from 4 - 7 Tues through Sat. HH is all night long on Sun and Mon. 2.  The barendars are THE BEST. George, Stefan, Derek, Christine, and Mark, make every customer feel special. 3.

Since we had so much time to look over the menu, we ordered right away. 20 minutes after ordering, still no salads. 10 minutes after that, waitress #1 comes out and had no idea we hadn't gotten our first course. Salad comes out, then another 30 minutes to get the main course. Waitress #2 now serving us along with waiter #1. Apparently our waitress #1 went home sick, which is fine, except that she had both handled our food plus not let anyone know she had left. It could have been made up for, however the food was extremely disappointing. Like, 10/10 for description, and 2/10 for actual flavor. Really disappointing, I'd been looking forward to coming here for a long time. Definitely not coming back nor recommending.",

    "text": "I had never been to Roaring Fork so I was really excited to find out that my boyfriend was taking me to dinner here. We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday night, without reservations, and of course, all of the seating in the dining room was busy for about another hour, but there was plenty of space in the bar area so we just opted to sit there. The lighting in Roaring Fork is dim, giving it a warm, comfortable yet sophisticated ambiance. Our bartender/waiter was super friendly, along with the other staff that helped us out along the way, we had great conversations with all of them all night.  We started off with the Kettle of Green Chili Pork that comes with super soft and warm tortillas. It also come garnished with a roasted pepper. Now, I thought to myself \"I wonder if I can eat this\" and proceeded to ask this question out loud to my incredibly thoughtful and caring boyfriend, who respond \"yeah, its just a green pepper\". Well, guess what, it's not a green pepper, but rather a roasted serrano pepper so I can't really tell you if this appetizer was delicious because my mouth was on fire (I'm also kind of a wuss when it comes to pepper heat). I'm assuming it was because of all the other Yelp reviews and also the fact that the boyfriend finished off the app just fine without me despite laughing hysterically the entire time - dick.   By the time my entree arrived, I started to get feeling back in my mouth and was able to enjoy the Spit Roasted Half Chicken which came with veggies and corn bread Stuffing. Oh my goodness, the chicken was yummy, but that corn bread stuffing was amazeballs that I wish I could order that up as a side dish! So good! The boyfriend ordered the Braised Beef Short Ribs that came with mashed potatoes. He enjoyed his, but was impressed with the corn bread stuffing as well. For desert we opted for their gelato which is made by Talenti. We got the Sea Salt Caramel and Banana gelato which were both so delicious. The Caramel one came with mini chocolate covered sea salt caramel truffles and the Banana came with caramel ribbon swirl and pieces of chocolate. We were both happy we decided to stay here for dessert and would definitely get both gelato options again!  Amazing food, great service, will be back for dinner and would love to try their happy hour!",

For dessert we split the Pecan Pie which was accompanied by dulche de leche ice cream. It's not a big piece but is dense and rich.

This year I was very disappointed in the Roaring Fork. The only few things I can say that I still love about this place is the quality of beef that they serve. It's aged and couldn't be better. Now let's get down to our disappointments this time. The three young girls who were the hostesses was the first sign that things have gone south. When entering any restaurant it's like entering someone's home and the greeting is the first impression. These girls did not smile once they were aloof and rude. They actually did their job right but had very poor people skills. They all need to go to sweet smiling school for sour apples. The lovely porterhouse was ruined by the way the chef cooked it. There was so much grease or butter cooked with the meat that it made a beautiful steak greasy and dripping with too much butter. It was too heavy. This spinach and onion side was so salty we couldn't eat it. The twice-baked potatoes was overcooked and the cheese topping was chewy hard. The service was good and the cocktails were nice but there are so many other restaurants in this town that exceed The Roaring Fork now. They need to get it together. There's a lot of good competition out there.",

My boss and I split the Ahi Tuna Quesadilla and the Green Chile Mac & Cheese.  Mind you, I'm not a huge mac & cheese fan, but this was really good.  If I ate this more often, I could learn to be a fan.  Enjoyed the Boneless Buttermilk Chicken with smashed potatoes and Peppercorn Gravy.  It was delicious.

Grant it - the food was good, the service was excellent (although our server did not have much of a personality and made it very transactional), and the ambiance nice. But there was nothing about this restaurant that would make me go again. The food was your average steakhouse food, and although it was all prepared well, there was nothing unique about it. If you are looking for something different, this may not be the place for you.",

    "text": "Ok, so this was my very first time at the RF and I thought it was a blast. Maybe it's because I was brought here on a date and was totally spoiled to the max!   I still give this place a 4-star rating because the overall experience at the end of the night was amazing!   CON:  However, we didn't make reservations and went around 6 p.m., it was Happy Hour and the bar was pact to the brim. We were told that the next reservation open would be at 8:30 p.m. and we didn't want to wait, so the waitress told us  that the bar and patio tables were first-come, first-serve. There were no tables open for us and we couldn't even make it to the bar to put in some drink orders, some customers were rude and it really agitated me and I thought this whole experience was going to suck... EDIT: Also, the waitress, well, we hardly saw her.  PRO: The BF, on the other hand, thought that it would be a better idea to go shopping  and then come back later during the 8:30 reservation time. And boy was he right. What a difference it made to be at the restaurant from a different perspective, no crowd shoving, rude people, etc.  DRINKS: -The BF had several different kinds of beers (I tried a bit of them all), but we were a bit disappointed that they didn't have any on tap.   -I had the \"Octoberfest\" I don't remember who made it, but the beer tasted a bit sweet, kinda chocalateee' -I also had a \"Prickly Pear Mojito\" which was very good, but a little too sweet for my taste, oh and the bartender was pretty generous too!   FOOD:  We had a three-course meal!  -For our appetizer they gave us bread and butter, and then we ordered \"The New Mexico Fondue Pot Lamb Chops\" (three piecesof lamb and some bits of chili pastacio bread, rosemary bruchette and butternut squash) and boy was that tasty. -The BF ordered a the \"BIg Ass Burger\" and I ordered probably the most expensive thing on the menu, the \"Filet Mignon\". I ordered it 'blue', my favorite way, and yes, they got it right! (it was just  tad salty, but still really yummy!) -For a side, we shared the \"Green Chili Macaroni, which we barely finished, but made for an excellent (thick) late night snack. (microwaved)  - Dor dessert, I ordered a Brownie (Lava cake), a la mode! It went excellent with coffee, especially since it was very sweet and thick (very rich). The BF was way to full to help me eat it, so sadly, a lot of it was left behind.     ATMOSPHERE: Loved, loved, loved the dark warm cozy feel! The antler chandeliers were a nice touch as well :)  PRICE: I would say expenisive, or at least the way I ate! But then again, I didn't get the chance to participate in HH. I suggest that if you plan to do the HH, you get there at 4 p.m. (when the RF opens and when HH starts)",

Everything tasted great, but I found it annoying that there wasn't ONE entree option.  They also give you a great bread basket with out of this world corn muffins. I gave a star just for them.  The decor of the restaurant is really nice and they have a nice patio that is heated/cooled.",

All 6 of the men ordered the rib eye steaks and each chose a different side since the steaks were a la carte. The sides were all served family style and were very decent portions for sharing. I ordered the carnitas with tortillas and it melted in my mouth! The tortillas were very good as well.  They have a minimal menu, which was OK because what they did offer was delicious. My husband who is a steak  connoisseur , said it was one of the best steaks he has ever had.  The wine list was lacking, but was decent. The happy hour prices are very good and I think the hubby and I will go back for happy hour appetizers and drinks for sure. (the guava mojito was yummy!)  All told for seven of us with multiple alcoholic drinks, hefty meals and desserts, we got out for $600 with the tip, so not too bad. It was an excellent choice to capture Arizona and impressed our clients the way we were hoping to. The food was good, the ambiance nice but not stuffy, and the service was top notch.",

Everyone that tried a bite said if was very \"strong\".  My husband got the halibut special, it was a little dry.  Friend got the fried chicken, she thought it was ok.  Fried chicken should be golden brown and this was a little over fried.

    "text": "We're from the San Francisco Bay Area,,,  this was our 2nd visit to the Roaring Fork,, in Scottsdale AZ.    We returned this visit as we had a craving for the Lamb chop fondue appetizers,,, from our first visit.      Parking was a bit of a struggle,, at 5:30pm.  We were seated after a 10minute wait for our 5:30 reservations made 3months in advance.    Our group of 5 adults were seated at a booth,, a little cramped, could have been an issue with others,, but  \"we were fine.\"    Our waiter was kind,, a little bit of a \"dry\" personality,, and seemed to lack a bit of the finness for a nice dinning experience,, eg. passing plates of food over our heads.  This did not tarnish our good evening at all.    Our drinks arrived along with two appetizer servings of the lamb chops...  for dinners,,, I had seen the Big Ass Burger while we were walking in,,  I had to have that,,,even though we were in a NICE restaurant.  Also ordered was the trout, the sea bass, filet, and the lamb chop appetizer with a Caesar salad...     my burger was perfectly done,,a challenge to eat, but so delicious with a great beef flavor... all was good, however those who craved the lamb chops,,, all commented that flavor was NOT as good as our first visit,,    desserts:   Pecan pie was a good choice,,, but the Three of us had the Root Beer Floats,,,  3 thumbs UP.     a nice experience,,     but I'm not sure Roaring Fork will rank AS high on our next visit to Scottsdale,, due to the disappointing Lamb chops.   Many other MEAT spots to try.    Note:  perhaps the disappointment may have been by the lack of presentation ,,,  our waiter only lit the candles under one cheese pot,, we had to ask him to light the one ordered as a dinner entree.  They lacked the charred fire pit flavor and were not hot n juicy,,  perhaps sat on the counter too long after they came off the grill.     JMHO.    I was not one of the  three disappointed.",

The menu doesn't seem to change and that's likely not a bad thing. This is the second time that I've had the double-cut pork chop. It is one of the best chops that I've had anywhere. I don't care for the mash that the chop comes on. It's just too sweet for my tastes but I'm sure many folks like it sweet. The green chili Mac n cheese is something we order every time. I didn't enjoy it as much as I usually do but I wasn't truly in the mood.  The service is always excellent. Almost too much attention as we are not needy diners and do not need to be checked on frequently.  My only True complaint is that the back area of the restaurant, where we've been seated at least 3 times, is quite hot temperature-wise. Will be back I'm sure!",

    "text": "So we are a large group of girls (10) who try and gather once a month for  birthday celebrations.  We have often discussed finding a place that we would call our go to happy hour place.   We have tried this place for the last four months and every time there is a new restriction.   As much as we love the place we just cannot deal with all of the restrictions that come with it.   The first time we thought well it is just that we are a large group that cannot ALL show up at 3:45 (cuz we have jobs).  The second time it was well maybe we just caught them on an off night.   Unfortunately, the last two times have just been BAD.   Between the Manager and our waitress making us feel like we were a bother, (who wants to feel unwanted???) we have made a group decision that the Roaring Fork is just not a  customer friendly environment.   We will be taking our monthly happy hours elsewhere.",

    "text": "We chose this spot after reading reviews on Yelp and looking at their menu. It's a really big and stylish place.   We arrived 5 minutes early for our 6:30 reservations for 2. We were told it would be closer to our reservation time before our table was ready. We were seated about 8 minutes late but the restaurant was very busy.  The menu features a lot of appetizing choices and we had a bit of a hard time choosing. My wife ordered the fish tacos and she really enjoyed them while I got the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon based on the recommendation from our waiter, Brandon.   It was really good and I was glad I ordered it. The pork was a perfect medium and it was nicely paired with creamy cheesy grits and smoky Mexican corn. We also each had a salad to start (they are perfectly sized for one, which was great as we couldn't agree on what to share). I enjoyed their take on the classic wedge salad with big chewy bits of salty bacon while my wife was fond of the date salad with creamy goat cheese and sweet dares.  I wasn't too excited by the service-maybe 3 stars. To be fair it was super busy but they \"failed\" my water glass test (how often they refill the glass-something that I've found sets the top restaurants apart). In our case my glass sat empty for well over 5 minutes before being noticed.  Also our server was a bit hard to find when we wanted to order more wine.  All in all the food here was really good, 4 star quality and presentation.  In my book, service is the key determining factor that amplifies good food and turns the experience into a 4 star (or higher) event. So 3+ for the Roaring Fork.",

I was deciding between a few different places, but picked roaring fork based on the reviews and the recommendation of a few friends- and I was so glad I did!   For appetizers, we ordered tortilla soups and the mussels and chorizo.  The soup was delicious! I don't eat seafood, but the group all said the mussels and chorizo was amazing!  For entrees, we had braised beef short ribs, filet mignon, ribeye and the blackened redfish. Everyone RAVED about their meals! For a side, I had the twice baked potatoes and they were absolutely heavenly!!!   I would definitely come back here! I've also heard the happy hour here is really good!",

It was fresh but a bit bland. It only had a few walnuts and maybe two cranberries.  My girl had the muscles which were in a nice tomato sauce and were quite fresh. The duck was also prepared well at med-rare. Throughout the night the service was good.   The nice ending to the being was the warm pecan pie. The slide of pie was very deep and despite not being hat hungry we both ending up eating it all. Plus, it balanced out the taste of the nuts with a subtle sweetness.  Overall, the evening was relaxing and as always we enjoy eating here when we're in town. It's a great staple that has great food.  Also, while leaving 2-3 staff said \"have a great night\" which always adds a nice positive touch to an evening.",

Both of them were wonderful!! Very tasteful and larger portions. We then got a special dessert called the banana cream pie. It was also wonderful! I'm not sure if the dessert will be there long term but if they have it, do yourself a favor and try it. I also got an alcoholic Arnold Palmer and it was very, very good!

I had an appetizer steak salad which was incredibly tasty with a generous portion of steak (honestly twice the size or what I expected) and a blackened red fish.   I would give both dishes 5 Stars, as they were delicious!    Bartender was super attentive, and making sure I was taken care of despite a full house.   Highly recommend this spot!",

The food is superb and the service is epic. Yes. Epic.   We had appetizers, drinks, entrees and deserts. For a family of four (including an 11 month old who didn't eat) we spent around $200.

The patio is beautiful especially when the weather is nice. Most recently we had the guacamole to start (delicious an so fresh!), rainbow trout (yum!), and he had the bacon wrapped tenderloin which he sad was really good. The cocktails and drinks are always great. We also had the pecan pie for dessert, and it was tasty! The prices are really appropriate for the quantity and quality of the food, and for the consistently great service. Plus they have an awesome happy hour where you can snag a good deal - but be warned it can get pretty busy and can be hard to find a seat.  Definitely a must-visit if you haven't been!",

I am sure I could have picked better options but the menu has too many beef or pork based temptations to go another way. I had a shrimp with spicy creamy dipping sauce that was insane and the house specialty the Green Chile Pork Stew was an amazing adventure. This stew was simply pork with hot cheese and strips of green hot peppers all cooked together in a small urn that you might have see hanging over a campfire 100 years ago. The atmosphere was fun and lively and the service was very good. I guess there are some desert specialties but we didn't try any- a bakery at the front of the restaurant makes it easy to take home the delicious-looking desserts as well.",

It is served with fresh cut french fries. You can also substitute with their famous green chili macaroni and cheese.

It's located in an office building off of the main road, which is kinda weird.  Upon entry, we were immediately greeted.  They were having some decent happy hour specials such as cheaper appetizers and $5 drinks.  We managed to grab the last table at the bar area.  Shortly after we seated ourselves, the waiter came over and was prompt with putting our orders in.  My bf loved the margarita, but it was a bit too sour for me.  For our entrees, I got the fried chicken and my bf got the beef ribs tacos.  My fried chicken was very good, but I have to admit the bf got the better entree.  The meat on his tacos were incredibly tender and the flavors were more complex than I imagined for a taco.  My fried chicken had perfectly crispy skin and the gravy was delicious.  The mashed potatoes were a bit runny for my liking, but I do like them thicker.  My bf thought it was a close match between his tacos and the fried chicken.  The food and drinks came out quick.  Service was very professional.  I wouldn't mind returning here.  My only hesitation is that outside of the burger, entrees are kinda pricey since they start at $17.  The food is very good, however.",

A while later, after I noticed other tables getting served that were seated after us, the waiter popped bye and said that our food should be coming up shortly.

    "text": "My wife and I had 4 others meet us on the bar patio for happy hour. We looked at the appetizer menu and I decided to try the BIG ASS BURGER.  This meal was not an appetizer, it was huge. It came with fries and both the burger and the fries were good. It has to be over 1/2lb of beef, I had all I could do to finish it but during happy hour it was $9. Great deal  When dinner (and several drinks) were over, our server started telling us about the deserts and recommended the banana split. This is a banana with chocolate chunks, and caramel wrapped in a tortilla and fried, then rolled in cinnamon and sugar and served with ice cream and sauce.   Ohhh, This was so good and rich, she brought one desert and 6 spoons. We had all we could do to finish it.  The mens room is a hike from the bar patio, infact it is in the middle of the adjoining office building. I was surprised that a place this nice did not have it's own mens room.",

    "text": "Come hungry, leave stuffed and much lighter in the wallet, but you definitely get what you pay for and are happy to do so!  Seriously this place was amazing...we shared the chicken flatbread and the pork wings to start with a nice bottle of riesling.  I only got one piece of the flatbread to try (because i had an entire pork wing to myself) and it was super delicious with a lovely pesto flavour from the sauce.  The pork wings were slow roasted so the meat just fell off the bone and the Dr. Pepper bbq sauce was delicious!  For a main course most of us had the sugar-cured duck breast....they were generous with the duck, the 'little cabbages' (aka brussel sprouts) were delicious and i rarely like ones done by anyone other than my mom, and the flavours were just to die for.  The duck skin was incredible and the meat perfectly cooked so it was beautifully juicy.  The bf had the short ribs which turned out to be massive and I got to try a bite - amazing flavour and the meat was super tender so you didn't need a knife at all to pull it apart!  We shared a bowl of the green chili mac and cheese and a plate of the asparagus...definitely sides worth trying but you should plan on sharing them...portions are not tiny!  The green chili mac and cheese was coated in a light dusting of breadcrumbs that just worked with the flavours!  For dessert I tried the deep fried banana split tortilla thing which I somehow managed to down (again, generous with portion sizing) after finishing my red wine, and I don't know how I did it but that was delicious...two scoops of icecream, one chocolate, one vanilla with c hocolate bits, whipped cream, two deep fried banana rolls, and a dusting of cinnamon...yum!  My mother and sister ordered cappuccinos that came with a lovely dusting of cinnamon that i could smell from across the table and two little rock-sugar cubes...if I hadn't been stuffing my face with bananas and icecream I probably would have tried one they smelled so good!  All in all, not cheap but as i said you get what you pay for and the size matches the quality to the point where you don't want to stop eating until you have to roll home...luckily the hotel was just around the corner and across the street...so good we will be back for sure!!",

    "text": "I just dinged a star off after finding out there are three additional locations in Texas. The food is MEAT. Huge portions, pricey and delicious. They offered a two for one entree deal for super bowl Sunday so we checked it out.    The restaurant is really cozy and feels like a \"grown up\", date restaurant. We were seated in the Arizona room which has less ambience. Next time we will opt for the bar or the little tables by the kitchen. It is wood fired cooking so the place smells great walking in.    It always annoys me when the $42.00 rib eye comes ala carte. Yes, know it is organic and quite large but throwing in a small side of mashers or a steamed carrot or two would be a nice gesture. That being said, we ordered the green chili mac as other yelpers recommended and oh my... Outstanding! The Yukon horseradish mashers were a bit overpowering but it did encourage me to try to make them at home. I had a lamb shank which was melt in your mouth divinity. The au jus was perfect to soak up the homemade brioche.    The wine list was fine, nothing special but had a good range of reds and whites and prices. The service was good. We went really early, with the elderly set and loved the 2:1 deal. Yes we will go back, it was a special meal.",

    "text": "We are new to the area, so we opted to try the Roaring Fork (RF) as part of the AZ Restaurant Week promotion for $44 p/p.  It was a good dining experience; however, I agree with the overall Yelp 4-star (ours is a 3.5+ rounded up) rating for RF for a few reasons:  1)  Though the decor/ambiance is casual with antlers, a western theme, 70's music, and a lively bar, the white table cloths and black-attired, formal/stiff servers are inconsistent with the  more modern vibe and moderately-priced menu items.   2) Both of the Delmonico/rib eye steaks we ordered were seasoned PERFECTLY and cooked precisely to our specifications, so kudos to the kitchen; however, the tastiness was almost overshadowed by the chewiness.  The tenderness of the meat is a result of its inherent quality; the chefs can only cook the meat they are given.  We hold management/the meat buyer responsible for selecting a lesser quality cut that was also sliced too thick for it to be easily consumed.  I hope that lesser cuts weren't purchased for the Restaurant Week promotion?  This would be foolhardy because for couples like us who eat out frequently and are new to the area, we were assessing whether we'd return to RF from our initial visit.    My frozen lime margarita was delicious, my husband loved his tortilla soup appetizer and I loved my salad with dried cranberries, candied walnuts, and goat cheese.   The mashed potatoes that accompanied the steaks were also yummy.  I had the chocolate pecan pie with butter pecan ice cream.  It was to die for.... Decadent and outstanding!  My husband's creme brule custard suffered from being too loose under its hard shell with a more dominant vanilla flavor than we are used to.    So, yes, we are qualified fans of the Roaring Fork and intend to try them again in the future.   P.S. We did take our steak leftovers and will enjoy them at home despite the jaw exercise :-).",

The food was scrumptious, the atmosphere was very warm, and the service was fantastic. They did not rush me or bring all courses together. I was able to have a nice 2.5 hour dinner on both nights, and that is just the way I like it. I ordered the breaded chicken - which was just fantastic - and the fresh guac the first night. Cannot go wrong with either. The second night, I stuck to their lamb appetizers and their mac and cheese. With the first bite, I wasnt sure what all the fuss was all about. Towards the end, I couldn't get enough. The lamb was phenomenal. Despite the fact that the appetizer came with three pieces, the server brought me four just to be nice. I tried two types of dessert as well on these two nights - the creme brulee and the cheesecake. Definitely preferred the cheesecake (as the creme brulee came a bit cold).   All in all, this is a fantastic and affordable place for a nice long relaxing dinner. HIGHLY recommended. Wish they were in California!",

    "text": "Been here quite a few times with various friends and family. Their menu changes seasonally but in summer time they have Dr. Pepper ribs that my wife loves and a filet mignon that is very tasty. During winter they seem to be more about the fish and chicken entrees.  Their Big Burger isn't to bad either.   Not a big drinker, but when coming here I always get the Arnold Palmer with firefly vodka which seems to be the only place that has this drink, and is probably the best drink I have ever had, besides the pear champagne I had at my wedding.  Appetizer wise I have had and love the guac and chips as well as the tortilla soup.   The last time we went I took my parents out for their birthdays here and my dad being the person that is hard to please was even impressed with pork and my mother loved the carnitas.   The service is excellent and should be a role model of how restaurant service should be, with constant watch over my drinks, NOT bugging me on how the food was immediately after I just received it.   Great place for special occasions or just for a delicious meal.   Overall: I would recommend this place and is quite affordable for a nice night out.   Note: Would recommend making reservations to ensure that seating is available as on weekends they do get busy.",

Other foods I tried included the white bean soup (made with a pork base which made it pretty much delicious) and shrimp and grits. Were these any old grits you ask? Funny you ask because no is the answer. They were corn grits, which sounds odd and is mighty tasty.  The atmosphere here is warm and cabin-y. It seems like a great place to scoot in close to your date and get involved in a romantic dinner. Equally, I saw a few ladies groups there toasting each other with glasses of wine and sharing appetizers. It's one of those places that most groups don't feel out of place in.  Overall, I'd say this is a bit of an upscale place, but not so fancy that you have to save it for special occasions. Unless, you're like me and treat everyday like a special occasion. ;-)",

    "text": "We came here during the happy hour not knowing it was happy hour. It was a packed house, even the bar and high top seats were all full.   We waited around for a few minutes and a table near the bar left so  it worked out perfectly.   The waitress brought us over some menu's. The happy hour menu seemed pretty good and had a wide variety but I was there for steak so  we didn't get main course off the HH menu, just drinks and salad.   The waitress said the burgers and steaks are all cooked on wood fired grill/plank whatever it's called. I ordered a medium rare filet mignon with lobster tail.   The wood fired grill is the real deal! The meat tasted like a campfire.. oddly described but I mean it in the best way possible! Every bite had the wood scent/taste/aroma. It was a little bit overcooked; more of a medium with bright pink center but I wanted medium rare so just warm in the center but it's all good. It still was pretty delicious. It was Prime meat, super tender! The 8oz lobster tail was grilled on wood also; a side of melted butter and wedge of lemon came with it.   Caeser salad is pretty typical, it has 2 strips of anchovies on top.   Spinach side was phenomenal. It was lightly seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, etc. It wasn't over cooked, there were actually some uncooked spinach mixed in the bowl that will cook when you mix it. Enough to share for 2.   Sadly no room for dessert, as per usual, but the selections seemed pretty good!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I'll definitely come back.",

    "text": "We were spending a few nights in Scottsdale and our hotel concierge recommended the Roaring Fork.  The restaurant was fully booked for reservations, but we were offered seats in a covered & heated patio area (it was a little chilly out.)   The table was great with a fireplace and multiple heaters.  Unfortunately we waited a few more minutes than expected for a waiter to come to our table.   We got the attention of the first waiter we saw and he immediately apologized.  It was not his table, but he began to take our order anyway.   Within minutes two separate managers came over to apologize for the confusion and the waiter apologized again.  The rest of the service was impeccable and the food was excellent.  The appetizers (guacamole and a Caesar salad) were very good and my wife could not stop commenting on how good the Rainbow Trout was.  My Duck was moist and tasted great (even though I like it a little more well done than usual.).   The Creme Brulee's and Pecan Pie were also very good.  When the check came they had given us a courtesy discount for the initial service error.   This was completely unnecessary because they had more than made up for the minor error with the rest of the meal.    Thanks for an excellent evening.",

This dinner experience unfolded beautifully for me, a table in the bar was available for me to sit at and had just been cleaned and ready for me to sit down and enjoy my meal. My waitress immediately brought me water and the happy hour menu. Turns out I had looked at the dinner menu before coming to the restaurant and decided on this restaurant because they had excellent price points for their food. When I reviewed the happy hour menu the price points for the food that I wanted were on that menu and even better than the dinner menu. Certainly a bonus in my favor. I had tortilla soup, mixed greens, grilled fish tacos, and huckleberry cheesecake for dessert. I can only say one thing about this meal, it was absolutely outstanding and truly delicious.  You can tell when the chefs care about every detail of the work that they do, and it is certainly prominent in this restaurant. That's all that needs to be said absolutely outstanding! I highly recommend that you try this restaurant in your near future, and I would certainly recommend this to my family, friends, and associates everywhere.",

It wouldn't have been so bad if the bar wasn't packed, as we couldn't find a place to sit.   We were seated in the back next to what appeared to be a private dining area (not really private as it only had a curtain). There seemed to be quite the loud, drinking group partying it up, which was a distraction to our dining experience. On the other side of us, there was another large 8-person party that was also quite loud - probably trying to talk over the noise of the other party.  That being said, there were three in our party. We ordered the duck breast, the boneless buttermilk fried chicken and the cedar plank salmon. All three were amazing and each of us cleaned our plates. The service was on point and the quality of the meal was perfect for the price point.   I would definitely go back - however I hope if I do, there are no loud large parties thinking they are the only ones in the restaurant.",

I highly recommend the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and the Green Chili Mac N Cheese was divine! I could eat buckets of it! I will definitely come back!  The poor building is in need of some TLC. Exposed pipes in the ceiling of a woman's bathroom stall, ceiling tiles looked like spray painted Styrofoam and a lot of them had scratch marks and were uneven. A few of the light bulbs were burnt out. I really like the decor and the theme of the restaurant, just needs some love!  One thing to be fussy over- I'm a germaphobe, and seeing the menus laid on top of the silverware was a little frustrating. Menus are touched by so many people and to lay them on top of the eating utensils made me nervous. Maybe keep the silverware wrapped up in a napkin if you have to put the menu on top..??",

My son had to dig the entire middle out. The meat had no juiciness to it at all. In fact it was downright dry.

    "text": "Arrived to a completely booked restaurant but immediately found a table on the patio with the same service as the full inside restaurant.  Ahhh!  The smells if BBQ permeate this hot spot.  Located in the corner ground floor of an office park in Scottsdale, elegance abounds.  It is a steakhouse with Arizona infusion written all over it.  This is a good thing.  Just in time for the end of happy hour, we ordered drinks consisting of margaritas, beer and wine.  Excellent service even though they were really, really busy.  So what to order, hmm, everything looked good.  On the advice of friends, my hubby ordered the carnitas with fresh guac and salsa.  This was drop dead good.  The pork shoulder was BBQ perfectly and arrived whole at table side. The idea is to whittle away at it and build you own taco with the freshly cooked tortillas provided.  Really delicious.  The short ribs were also ordered up and my girlfriend slid a taste my way.  It was bursting with SW sensuous flavors.  Any meat lovers should order this, although the carnitas were almost tied for flavor.  I however deviated from meat and ordered the almond crusted trout.  This was also excellent and given that I did get a small taste of the beef I was completely replete!  Prior to our entrees, salads were also enjoyed.  I had the beet salad.  Really good, fresh and sublime.  In all, I would give this a five star if we were at a better table.  The patio was a little chilly and at first the tables were a bit messy.  Not their fault as the table were turning over quickly and they were slammed. Next time a reservation shall be made.  Two thumbs up.  Hankering for really good BBQ meat, go there without stopping anywhere else!  Reservations highly recommended.  Easy parking, BTW",

I liked the vibe right away cool, cozy bar, great patio but also a good dining room. We sat at a high table in the bar. I ordered fried chicken, friend, rotisserie chicken , teen tortilla soup. Everything was good. Flavored and fresh. They do need to get some decent hot sauce for fried chicken all they had was tobasco but other than that food was good. Friend ordered a martini she said thumbs up. Price point was good and portions were generous. I will definitely add this to my list especially since it's 5 minutes from my house. It's a good comfort meal when you feel like that.",

The place was packed on a Thursday night. There are multiple dining areas where guests can watch the cooks on different parts of the line including the wood burning pizza oven, the broiler or saute station, etc. the inside was full, so we were offered a table outside. Unfortunately the outside section was a bit of a let down. It wasn't nearly as exciting and lacked the wonderful sights and sounds and intense aromas that diners were enjoying inside. It was bland and a bit boring, frankly. When our waiter approached us, he was very abrupt and seemed annoyed about something. We guessed that it was because he had been given a small table. Who knows. After all was said and done, the meal was enjoyable. The food was really outstanding, in fact. My only recommendation would be to sit inside, if possible. Don't know if there is much to do about a waiter having a bad day. I wouldn't go so far to say the service was bad, but a couple of sarcastic comments rubbed me the wrong way. I would love to go back, sit inside, and try a lot more of the food, which was sophisticated, elegant, well balanced, and just delicious.",

We were staying close by and called 20 min before it opened and got a reservation.  When were got there it was packed already even though it had just opened, but we got right in. Started with the seasonal salad with heirloom tomatoes and apples and it was excellent. Lots of flavor.  My husband got the pork tenderloin and it was delicious. Beautiful presentation. The corn and grits were sweet and delicious. I had the fish tacos. They were also great, a little bit stronger fish than I like, but still really good and the black beans which I normally don't eat were good too. Finished off the meal with pecan pie with Brown butter gelato and fresh whipped cream.  Rich and yummy.  Lots of pecans.  The gelato might have been the star of the dessert. The service was excellent, our water glasses were never empty and empty plates were removed immediately.  Would highly recommend.",

We were still without silverware when our food started coming out and then a server spilled the toppings from our chips all over the table, told us he'd be back to clean it up and never came back. Still have to give it 4 stars though  since this is my first review of this place and past experiences with service weren't this bad.",

I couldn't get enough of the lamb chops even though they were not part of happy hour and the B.A.B. was better than ever! BUT.... (you knew this was coming)...The two bartenders at happy hour on 5/6/2017 were just HORRIBLE. Hubby, asking for a Bloody Mary with potato vodka, should NOT result in a heavy sigh complete with eye roll. \"Well, that's not on the happy hour menu,\" was the comment he received back. Well, neither were the lambs chops, my friend. I ordered my Chardonnay which was plopped at the far edge of the bar and never poured for me from the decanter. FOOD WAS TERRIFIC (didn't I say that already?) Next round of drinks. Gentlemen to the left and right of us were served. We were ignored, so I started to time how long it would take for them to attend to us. TWELVE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SIX SECONDS later I finally shouted, \"Excuse me!! Hello! I've been waiting twelve minutes and thirty six seconds for another round of drinks.\" Blondie runs right over to HER PARTNER and says, \"She's (pointing finger in my direction) timing us.\" No kidding Sister. Your customer service is atrocious. No smile, no eye contact, I don't appreciate having my drinks slammed on the counter in front of me with a look of disgust. I did buy the gentleman and his lady friend sitting next to me a drink to try and change the vibes at the bar. And YES!, I complained to the night manager. And NO!, I refused any recompense for my issue. I would however, recommend that Roaring Fork FIRE!!!!!!!!!! these two idiots behind the bar or sell the entire restaurant to SAM FOX. HE KNOWS HOW TO RUN AN ESTABLISHMENT!!!! Don't forget, I said I loved the food! NO kidding!!",

Our client ordered the short ribs which I tasted and they were fall-off-the-bone tender and the sauce was super tasty. I ordered the oven roasted shrimp on a bed of cheese grits. Yum-my! One of my shrimp was only partially deveined but it was no big deal. My coworker ordered the halibut and he said it was perfectly cooked and equally as tasty.  Looks like a great lunch place too.

We ordered the chicken flatbread appetizer. It was delicious. My salmon was cooked perfectly with a tad bit of BBQ sauce marinated on top, pure perfection. I chose mash potatoes as my side, the gravy was amazing. The presentation of the dinner was very southern and I liked that, very different and unique in Scottsdale.

I ordered a salad with chicken, and it was decent. We were hoping for some good vegetarian options, but they didn't seem to have any.",

They ran completely out of brisket at the carving station and replaced it with a RAW pork loin. It wasn't just undercooked, it was Red in the middle when they cut into it. They took it back and cooked it some more but then brought it back out to the carving station and served it directly on the cutting board where they had just cut the raw pork loin a few minutes earlier.  The fried chicken was like eating leather. We didn't even get to try several of the items because they were out and it took forever for the empty trays to be replaced.  Big disappointment. Will never go back.",

Who would expect to be seated outside in the summer?   Had we known, we would never have agreed to this.  After some debating we were given a table indoors.  We were there to celebrate our Anniversary and this completely ruined our evening.  Needless to say, they were running a special and very busy. We were told the Manager would come over to our table and that never happened either.  It was extremely disappointing to say the least.  The only highlight was our waitress, Amanda.

I wouldn't say it was terrible and the service was good, but we have no desire to go back. We took my parents there and they had the same feelings. The guacamole appetizer was ok. Dad had the big ass burger and said it was overdone. I took a bit and totally agree. Mom and wife had the sugar cured duck. It looked and tasted like pork and some had a bit of gristle. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor (I sampled it too). I had a mixed green salad with cranberries and pecans. It was probably the highlight of my meal. I ordered the spot roasted chicken for dinner because it looked and smelled awesome roasting when we walked in. Unfortunately the breast was dry and the thigh was tiny and I've probably had better chicken at Boston Market for a lot cheaper. Dad and wife liked the pecan toffee pie and ice cream. I didn't care for it but I don't like toffee. Overall disappointed and wouldn't really recommend this place unless you have money to burn.",

    "text": "Worst restaurant experience ever..!! I would give no stars if I can..  Four stars on Yelp, so who wouldn't give it a try right..?!?! So my girlfriends and I chose this place for our happy hour gig. And so this is how it went. 3 friends first got to the place at 430ish and it was already almost packed at the bar area where the happy hour is only allowed. The 3 girls tried to scout the area where we could sit and enjoy but to no luck because the bar area is a first come first serve basis. They informed the receptionist and were offered that we can stay at the regular dining area but can only stay til 630..because they have reservation...(trying not to write down the girls' reactions to this). 10 girls all together for happy hour and only 2 hours to chat, that's not possible and to be told to have a time limit to eat at a well known restaurant..?!?!? So the receptionists offered to call the manager to settle and accommodate us who never came after 30mins. At this time, most of us already were in the restaurant and eager to sit and start. We were offered again to stay at the regular dining area but can only stay til 730..hmmm..we really wanted to try the place so we gave in, 3 hours will at least be enough..One of us stayed at the front area and insisted on talking to the manager while the rest of us were ushered to our table...all the way to the very far corner of the room..and the entire room is EMPTY..!!! And they have told us the tables are all reserved. We tried to take some deep breaths and still be optimistic with our day. Our friend who insisted on talking with the manager came back and told us of their conversation. She only stated to the manager that we have never heard of such comments (stated above) from restaurants staff ever before and this is what the manager whose name is Ivars Melbardis had told her: \"We are already giving you a courtesy by giving you a table at the regular dining area.\"   Really...?!?! We were all in shock!! We have never experienced anything like it. After hearing that shocking rude comment, we immediately decided to leave the place even though we've already been seated. We were in disbelief on how they treated paying customers like us and to say like we owe them for coming in to their restaurant. Such an arrogant manager!   I know this might be a very rare occasion but there's no excuse to treat customers like that. It is very rude and inappropriate. I hope this never happens to those who wanna try this place or any other place in that matter. My friends and I just want this incident to be out there for awareness.",

It is also cramped and crowded at the bar and I spotted a good number of those fruit fleas swirling around the bar area. Place caters to the well heeled and sweater wearing crowd and although it was Monday Night football, no volume was on the small TV and nobody, but me, was really interested in the game. The least expensive food for HH is 6 bucks and that is bowl of soup. Other dishes that came out looked like the ole tiny portions at HH prices swaperoo. I tried their famous Huckleberry margarita and although not bad, it came out of a machine and a swirl of huckleberry or something similar was put on top of drink. Nothing here at this place warrants a return viisit and they should work on that fruit fly problem beacuse that is a major issue swatting them away sitting at the bar.",

(And I am not just saying that becuase I recognized him from a restaurant he used to work at and we have friends in common.)  Within our group, we had the pork green chile, fried chicken, salmon, ribs and lamb.  A couple sides of green chile mac, a side of asparagus, and a couple to-go boxes at the end!

Really dumba** you saw us standing here, but we have to ask you?!!. What did you think that I was just standing there for the hell of it?!! How about you put a freaking sign up that states seat yourself if you're not going to have someone at the front to greet customers that come in.",

    "text": "If you are heading here for happy hour, I am about to give you the best Yelp advice ever. Go early and scope out tables that are paying their check, stand there and wrestle any interlopers to the floor in a fight to the death. Why? Because my party was polite and gave our names to wait for a happy hour table as they were all full. We sat there while 20 or so people just barged through the hostess podium and snagged up every seat that was opening up. Being somewhat intelligent, we learned to do the same and finally got a spot in the bar, which is the only place that serves happy hour drinks and specials. I think if you go there by five you may get a seat instantly, otherwise, use my ninja method and you will access the greatness that is The Roaring Fork.   Super vibe, everyone glad to be there. Wait staff is overworked with the crazed happy hour bunch, so if you're having a date night, sit in the upscale dining area that will impress your special someone. People were well-dressed, mainly professionals and quite a few retirees (Area is full of senior neighborhoods).   The happy hour drinks do not skimp on the alcohol. Quite the opposite, so have a DD. The big ass burger is a must, we also got raves on the chili verde pork and salads. Nothing was sub par except the learning curve on figuring out how to get into this place.   My advice to the management would be to actually require the hostess to seat people, so that the rudest, pushiest people do not win. Take names and have your seating be as beautiful a thing as your food. Because those pushy people are also walking around the place like sharks hunting prey and we found that to be very annoying.",

The food is fresh and flavorful--our group had the Blackened Redfish, Salmon, and Double Pork Chop--all our plates were cleaned! Our server literally picked up a napkin that had fallen on the ground and placed it on my husband's lap, lackadaisically threw the glass of Pinot on the table, and just seemed too distracted to be concerned with our dining experience--sad trombones--wah, wah",

Granted I am a senior citizen but it boggles my mind that people enjoy a meal surrpunded by a cacophony of sound. I do not recommend the Roaring Fork and its name is appropriate.

I could find no fault with most of the dishes we were served, from the bread to the fig and goat cheese complimentary pre-appetizer to the main courses (trout and blackened redfish).  The sides with the redfish were not only tasty but perfectly complimented the fish.  Only the delicious creme brulee had a tiny problem - it was still too warm and had not completely set -- but we devoured it eagerly anyway.  Add to this that the prices are quite reasonable for what is truly a fine dining (modern style) experience, and Roaring Fork takes a place on my \"return to\" list.  A few very small issues - our table for two was a bit too small, I didn't care for the music (some sort of raucous jazz I think), and the separation of the happy hour and dining areas was confusing - I should be able to get the happy hour discounts in the dining area.  Thanks for a fine meal, Roaring Fork.",

The green chili mac & cheese, salmon, duck, and lamb chop fondue are all delicious. It's usually hard to decide what I want, since I want it all! Make sure you save room for their fried banana dessert, so good! It's definitely large enough to share. It used to come with cinnamon gelato which was delicious (please bring it back?!). The service is always friendly and they're very accommodating for larger parties. I've always gotten a signed card by everyone when coming here for my birthday. I recommend making a reservation. Overall, I love coming here because I know I'm going to leave with a happy belly and be well taken care of the whole time.",

The bar area has a happy hour very popular with locals so forget getting a seat at the bar. The main dining area opens at 5. The plus of the place is definitely the service. The food is not outstanding but not bad either. The rotisserie chicken (cooked over a fire) was a bit bland and needed salt, although the portions were generous.

    "text": "I am always the one who has to plan happy hour with my design team and I have read nothing but great reviews about this place so I thought it would be perfect and it was 7 minutes away from the event we had to go to at Scottsdale Community College.   I made reservation for 13 people. They said all they had available was on the patio, which I love. They also called and confirmed my reservation a few days before. I was a little worried trying to find the place since it's in old town but it was pretty easy after I read all the other yelp reviews on where it is located and at 5pm parking was not a problem, it just wasn't right by the door which is fine. The sign is a little hard to read at that time but it's a metal sign and if your by a bunch of office buildings, your in the right spot.   We got there early for our reservation and they actually sat us early and had our table all set up on the patio. Really nice patio!   We just ordered a bunch of different appetizers from the menu. Oh and we found out once we sat down that the happy hour menu does not apply if you are sitting outside. But all the appetizers we ordered were delicious!!! Guacamole was wonderful ! The chicken flatbread I could not stop eating even though I was full! The queso was very good and a little spicy. I ordered wine , but looking over the drink list, they had some very delicious sounding cocktails.   When we left every one in our group told me they loved the pick of the restaurant! So this was definitely a winner for our group. Thank you Roaring Fork for taking care of our big group ! You guys did it perfect !  I am excited to come back with my boyfriend and sit in the bar and get all the appetizers again! I have already recommended the place to people!",

I was craving a steak and finally thought to stop by to get my fix, but as we were waiting to place our order I saw one of the Big Ass Burgers pass on by and I was seduced! I'm so glad I changed my mind because it was the perfect burger!!  Now that that's out of the way, here are some other insights:  1) Call ahead and make a reservation - and get there on time! We saw a couple lose their reservation because they were late. The bar gets really full, so be prepared to wait for a table, especially if you're in a group!  2) When we first arrived I thought I was wayyyyy under dressed, but when we were walking to our seats I was surprised by the extremely eclectic types of patrons: from upper middle class/dressed to impress folks, to business people just getting out of the office, to people in work out clothes, and lots of families with little ones. Literally saw it all! So I guess you can dine in whatever attire suits you.  3) The portions are large, we came on empty stomachs and we def got our fill.   4) The food was FRESH... like freaky fresh! It was so good from the wedge salad to the freshly cut fries, down to the veggies on my burger everything tasted amazing and perfectly ripe and delicious!!   5) Our server was great! Danielle was super nice, gave us enough time between courses and was attentive, but not overbearing.   I def recommend for date night, it's a very intimate setting.  We'll be back for that steak!",

The inside is really nice it's got a western feel to it with a touch of fine dining class. Service was tops and everyone there had a way of making you feel like \"you are our guest and its our pleasure to serve you.\" had there 22 oz ribeye special, two sides, salad & pecan pie.($65). It was so good I didn't care how full I was I was determined to finish it. My party enjoyed their meals and gave me 2 thumbs up for my restaurant choice!",

So many menu options.you can spend a ton on a $50 steak or get a reasonably priced rottiserie chicken for $18. Uperscale restaurant that could charge way more for certain menu items if they really want to.",

The Delmonico boneless rib eye was ordered warm pink \"medium\" and came out a little over but was so juicy and unctuously fatty that it was just perfect! Combined with a bowl of tortilla soup and pecan \"pie\" that was melting chocolate and accompanied by a scoop of brown butter ice cream and whipped cream, it was a decadent and delicious meal.  Roaring Fork is now my favorite steakhouse in the Valley. Friends had duck, short ribs and the tenderloin and all were pleased with their meals.",

We both agreed on the Roaring Fork. We sat down almost immediately at 5:00. Steve was our waiter and was there quickly to get our drink order. I'd asked for a bourbon that is often rare at most nice restaurant bars. Unfortunately they were out. Steve was very apologetic. Right behind him was the restaurant's general manager with several high end options. We talked for a bit, comparing bourbon thoughts, and was brought a perfect substitute.  The service has always been very exceptional here as well as the menu having great local specialties and excellent signature items.  I can highly recommend the Roaring Fork as one of the \"must eat at\" restaurants in Scottsdale.",

The atmosphere is warm and comforting, dim lighting but you can see what you're eating without difficulty. The atmosphere goes well with the menu which consists mostly of comfort food. The basket of rolls served with softened butter is amazing! I could have eaten the entire basket myself. The small corn bread muffins with a hint of jalapeno were soft warm and fresh and so delicious as were the dinner rolls that also were soft and warm. My husband and I shared the wedge salad with bacon and ranch dressing and it was big enough to share and very fresh and iceberg nice and cold and crispy. It probably could have used a little more bacon. Several of us ordered the buttermilk fried boneless chicken which was very good, crispy lightly battered chicken breast. I had mine with the French fries instead of mashed potatoes and the French fries were great; seemed like they were cut fresh rather than frozen. Several others had the short rib entree and they all seemed to enjoy it. I tried a piece and it was excellent; very tender and a good sized portion. I also tried the grits with cheese OMG was that good. We were all so full that we couldn't even fit in dessert so we will definitely need to go back.",

Bar service was superb. Wait staff were awesome. Greeted by drinks, more drinks, breads, guacamole, apps, and it was awesome...  Everyone got some version of steak. All the cuts were perfectly cooked...everyone raved about their meals. My bone-in ribeye was massive and so well cooked throughout just medium rare enough and delicious. We got a few sides to share and there was a ton of food.   Our server was hilarious...great personality and the right amount of attention.   I was surprised by how reasonable the tab was at the end...I mean 7 guys at a steakhouse in LA and you're looking at a grand almost with apps, food, booze, etc...our bill was half that!    Location was interesting in what looked to be an office building cluster but we found it via Uber easily.   This place is a must in Scottsdale...no doubt about it. 5 star food, 5 star staff, 5 star value...",

    "text": "Every single bite was wow. Get there at the beginning of Happy Hour. 4PM. If you wait even 30 minutes, the place fills up. It's popular for a reason. They serve the real deal southwest cuisine. For starters, the tortilla soup. From the presentation, where they bring out a bowl with avocado, shredded chicken, cilantro, cotija, and tortilla strips (fresh made), and then fill the bowl in front of you with the soup base... to the very last bite; fantastic. The soup is so perfectly seasoned, I even commented how surprising it was to not want to salt or pepper it. The fish tacos are amazing. If that's your jam, get them, you won't be disappointed. But this review isn't going to highlight them (they're super good), because the green chili kettle with fresh buttered flour tortillas is on another freaking level! We ordered two. For three of us. However, the serving of this happy hour appetizer is filling for two people! There's enough of this green chili infused, melted gooey cheese masterpiece to go around man! And the tortillas, everything you'd expect from fresh made. Soft. Sturdy, the perfect adornment for this epic pot de wonder. I could eat this like probably every other day, just because I wouldn't want it to get old. But wait there's more! Save room for dessert ya'll! Spoiler alert, it's all amazing, but the pecan pie, my oh my! They make a browned butter pecan gelato to pair with it it. Plus a caramel drizzle. Plus whipped cream. The pie itself is a serving for two. It's highlights are the filling (with a surprise ingredient of chocolate chips!), and the crust, which is flaky, soft and delicious.  Dang it! Go there already! Just go! I'll be back every time in in Scottsdale.",

It was busy, so without a reservation, we had to sit at the bar, which was fine with us.  Amazing that they were so busy on a Thursday night on the 2nd week of November.  The waitress said it was even busier the night before!  She mentioned they have been around for over 20 years and have a pretty good following.  It was restaurant week, so they had a prix fixe special.  We all had a mixed green salad starter (good) and a bacon-wrapped filet mignon (very good) and a creme brulee for dessert.  The filet was well-prepared and very tasty/juicy.  If I came back, I would like to try the sea bass.  The interior is very nice, lots of stone and wood.  The service was very friendly and helpful.  Okay wine list.    I would definitely come back again next trip out this way.",

The ambience is warm and cozy, the happy hour menu is very nice with some of their house specialties included, the food is superb, and the service is fabulous. We sat in the outside bar area with a lovely fire nearby and the heaters blazing warmth with a nice chill in the outside air. Our server was amazing - great personality and perfect recommendations for us. We started with some happy hour favorites - fish tacos and pork wings with a few beers and a glass of wine. Our party of four was ready for the meal - scallops for my friend (grilled perfectly and flavored delicately); filet for her hubby (also cooked to perfection with a nice salty tang); my hubby had the ny strip - (huge cut of perfectly grilled steak); and I had the cioppino (loaded with monkfish, scallops, mussels, and lobster broth). To say the meal was amazing is an understatement. I would eat anything off that menu! Our dessert included their house pecan pie (loaded with chocolate chips & toffee bits) - a super decadent example of pecan pie with a buttery flaked crust. Our friends had the huckleberry cheesecake which was good but not as good as the pie with salted caramel ice cream. You must not pass this up! All in all, a perfect evening at Roaring Fork. Thanks guys!",

    "text": "Go for the happy hour, enjoy the drink specials ($5 martinis among others. Yay!) and order the Big Ass Burger, but before you do remember these points:  It's open seating during happy hour (which runs 4-7). There were people sitting and standing around showing various states of impatience when we arrived. We walked around through the bar and front patio (the only areas open for happy hour) searching for an open table. Finally, a very nice manager caught up with me and offered a booth in the dining area with the caveat that we'd need to finish up or move to the bar by about 6:45, before a dinner reservation came in. We jumped at the offer, likely pissing off some others who had been waiting as well, and probably longer . No complaints in the way it was handled, but be aware that it's popular happy hour with open seating and when you arrive for a table you are basically on your own.  Second, it's an older crowd.  They look more like Scottsdale golf course residents than workers from the surrounding buildings. No problem there, either. Just a reminder that the line between \"happy hour\" and \"early bird special\" continues to fade.  Third, it was busy so service was a bit slow, though not unpleasant at all.   I guess the message for y'all: This place gets busy during happy hour. :-)",

I will say, once you pay the bill, you are dead to them. We had just paid our $350 dinner bill, the waiter picked up the check and left. We were still chatting and finishing up our drinks when I accidentally knocked over a wine glass, breaking it into six pieces, spilling the wine all over the table.  We were picking up the large chards of wine glass when the waiter came back over and asked for his pen, he must have left after we signed the bill, we found his pen in the Malay and handed it to him, he sauntered off as if there wasn't a broken wine glass on our table.  Only thing I can figured is because the bill had already been paid and he has already been tipped.  We had to flag down another employee to help us clean it up.  When we were leaving, the two hostesses were wrapped up in their nightly to do list and didn't even say thank you or goodnight as we past them. No one even acknowledged us as we left.  We past by 10 employees. I don't know, maybe it's me, but customer service should be 100% until the customer is out of the door.  All that yummy food, wine and dessert we had and this is what I remember most from the night. The easiest thing to make perfect is your customer service, Ironic wouldn't you say.  Oh and the bathrooms were gross when I went in at 10:15. Water and paper towels all over the floor and sink area, no toilet paper in the stalls, we used toilet seat liners, I Know!  GA-ROSS! just plain messy.  The devil is in the details people!  Hoping they read this and take it constructively, we WILL be back , but when I pay a premium for a nice dinner , Is it too much to want toilet paper and a thank you. Did I mention the pecan pie to to die for?",

Because I go for he full experience, the atmosphere the ambience, decor, and of course the food and service.  So when we arrived there were plenty of empty tables but for some reason we were seated in the back forty.  Let me tell you avoid this seating because you miss the entire beauty of the restaurant.   We asked to be moved and were declined that option.  The couples next to us asked to be moved and were honored immediately.  The wan who sat us told us those empty tables had been reserved.   Nope not the case.    So the food was good not wowed.   The portions were ample I will say that.  But the management needs to brush up the staff a bit more.  This place is not cheap and I would have expected better service.  I wanted to really have a great experience for Mother's Day.   But it was just mediocre.   If you go don't sit in he back.",

We ordered the guacamole, which was good but overpriced for happy hour, and then green chili pork, which was so worth every penny--absolutely delicious. We tried mojitos, margaritas, and the spiked arnold palmer. All were delicious and strong.  The only places Roaring Fork loses points are the music: loud country. Bleh. And the patio view: parking lot.  I'd definitely go back, though. Not sure I could afford the normal menu, but the happy hour does just fine.",

People were looking at me funny but I was smiling cheek to cheek while eating this entire meal. I completely indulged. I had the half chicken with green beans and cornbread stuffing. The chicken was juicy. The cornbread stuffing had a good consistency. The sauce was a little bit sweet and perfectly complemented the savory chicken. The Chardonnay went well with my meal. The bananas foster flambe with rum cake was a great indulgence and enough to share. The service was impeccable!",

    "text": "Wow, I have never eaten at a place that was so all over the map in regards to service/food quality.  My husband and I came here on a Saturday evening to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Now, I was a dumb-o and forgot to make reservations.  I did try that morning, but you have to leave a voice mail because they don't open till 4, so that was totally my bad.  When we got there right at 6 pm, there was no one waiting in the waiting area and the bar was filling up.  We saw about 8 empty tables in the restaurant, I was excited because I thought oh good, we can still get a seat in the main restaurant.  We asked the hostess for a table for two.  She looked at me like I was crazy and said, sorry we are all booked up, you can go sit in the bar or our next available seating is at 9 (WHAT?!).  I said, well I can see several open tables and no one is waiting here, I didn't realize this was a reservation only restaurant, there was no mention of it on your website.  She then says, well its Saturday, so yeah its pretty much reservation only.  This older gal was none to friendly and said, just go hang out in the bar area and scope out tables.  Um, ok...  So we decided to sit in the bar and take her advice on 'scoping out' a table.  We find a table quickly and our bar waitress was not helpful at all.  Took her 5 min to hand us a menu, we ask for a regular menu, she brings one 5 min later.  I ask her for another regular menu so my husband can look at one too and she replies, oh ok...Off she goes, where to, nobody knows...In the meantime, the seating in the bar is just what you'd expect, crowded, not that comfortable, so we scope out one of the three booths in the bar area and waited until this couple left and switched to that booth.  This booth was great, even though we were in the bar, didn't feel crowded or rushed at all.  So, that was nice, plus our server over at the booth was much more attentive and friendly...  OK, on to the food....  We ordered the mojito and their signature margarita.  The mojito was delish.  First time I had ever had one and I would totally order again.  The margarita was gross.  It was straight up tequila or something.  Maybe others would be happy about that (LOL), but I was not.  We didn't even drink more than a few sips.  Told the waitress, her response...sorry.  On to our appetizer, we got the Big Ass Burger.  It was very good.  Definitely a great happy hour item.  We split this and loved it.  For dinner, I ordered the pork tenderloin with Mexican street corn and grits.  This was good.  The pork did not have much flavor (it was wrapped in bacon) which was surprising, but it tasted good if you ate it with a bit of the corn and grits with it.    My husband ordered the ribeye steak.  This came out BLACK.  He took a few bites and called over the waitress to tell her all he could taste was the charred from the steak.  So they send it back and remake him one (the manager comes over and profusely apologizes, which was nice).   The redone steak came out great and we were happy with it, tasted flavorful, etc.  Now, the manager comes back and says, we comped the drinks and the steak for your trouble.  I am thinking, wow this is great!  How nice of them, the evening started out crappy, the steak was burned, this will be great.  NO, while they did comp the drinks, they comped the REMADE steak.  So, our check showed two steaks, with one written off.  I bring this to the waitresses attention and she goes to check with her manager.  She comes back and says, no the bill is right.  We are comping the steak we remade for you. I was in disbelief.    Needless to say, our first impression of The Roaring Fork was not good and we will not be back.  Too bad, b/c I think the place has potential, but I can get food just as good, for half the prices and pretenses elsewhere...",

When the waiter came to pick up the check, I handed him the receipt and simply said \"You need to check this again\". I did not tell him what was wrong with the check; he didn't even look at the receipt and immediately said \"Oh, I'll remove one of the duck dinners\". He had no more eye-contact. I Truely believe this waiter was deliberately trying to rip us off. We are above-average tippers, and this is a high-end restaurant. He did not need to do it. I went to the restroom to cool off, I was so annoyed.  I should have said something to the manager, but I don't want to get people fired.",

We also had the lamb fondue, which is lamb rack with a squash sauce to dip them in. The squash \"fondue\" part was quite tasty. The lamb was cooked well.  For the main course I tried the braised short rib. It was really big. It didn't have a ton of flavour; a shame for such a tasty meat. It needed salt & pepper and the core seasoning just didn't stand out.  The food is good, but I feel it's all a bit under seasoned. Everything (except the lamb fondue) could have had some extra punch to it. Still, it wasn't so bad that you feel ripped off, so I'm going 3 stars on this.",

    "text": "Came here for Brunch on a Sunday and was disappointed. The hub and I had eaten here about a month before and it was very good. However, this time made us a little sad. Brunch at Roaring Fork is served buffet style and although we were excited at first about all of the offerings, our excite slowly decreased as we ate our food. We have begun to conclude that most buffets are not a good idea since the food never seems to be fresh. This, unfortunately, was no different with The Roaring Fork Buffet. Yes, all of the RF popular eats were displayed to try, however, had this been my first time here trying these items, we would have never wanted to go back. Thank god this was not our first time here, otherwise, we would not have known how good the green chili stew and cheesy grits truly are. Here are some details: The hubby and I tried almost everything which included Eggs Benedict on biscuits, chicken chiliquiles, herbed pork tenderloin, fruit parfait, fresh fruit, breakfast quesadillas, bananas foster bread pudding, sage and cornbread stuffing, green chili stew and tortillas, Chopped salad with ranch, Cheesy grits, fried chicken and loaded mashed potatoes, candied jalapeno slaw, chocolate opera cake, biscuits and meatball gravy, and roasted sweet corn. Out of all of that, the only items that were decent was the loaded mashed potatoes, bread pudding, jalapeno slaw, breakfast quesadillas, cornbread stuffing, fresh fruit (hell how can you screw that up) grits, and opera cake. I say decent because none were good or great, they were simply ok since they were not very fresh. The remaining items were a huge disappointment though. The Benedicts had overcooked eggs and not enough hollandaise (they should have had a dish of hollandaise off to the side in case you wanted more and because the hollandaise already on the Benedicts got kinda congealed and hard), Fried chicken had no flavor to it and was overcooked, green chili stew was not the same as the cheesy melty goodness we had had a month ago ordering the same thing, and honestly, the meatball gravy on the biscuits was absolutely horrendous. I usually don't feel the need to spit things out but the meatball gravy was very hard to consume and was to the point of being downright inedible. In any event, I still give this place 3 stars as the service was very good, the dining area was very nice, and I know how great their food can be during the dinner hours. My suggestion and hope for if I ever am forced (yes it would never be my own decision to go) to do brunch again is that they come up with a regular brunch menu in which you must choose and all items would be prepared fresh. Otherwise, I honestly feel that the brunch buffet is only giving The Roaring Fork negative feedback. As I stated earlier, if I was a first time customer coming for brunch, I would not return after this experience and I believe this would be the case with alot of first time customers.",

No specials were mentioned and the busboys kept trying to take plates of food that we were eating. And kept leaving the dirty glasses we had placed on the edge of the table. Sigh...does anyone get trained properly now? Anyway most of the food was stellar. The avocado/crab remoulade appetizer was inspired. The green pork chile with hot buttered tortillas was fabulous and the tortillas were pillows of goodness. We had ordered the short ribs and the smoked prime rib. Alas, the prime rib was a bit tough...it should be unctuous and beefy but didn't hit the mark. The horseradish cream was superbly done and really helped. The short ribs were served with a tomato coulis which neither of us really cared for. The ribs, however were outstanding. These were served with horseradish potatoes which were also very good.  Unfortuately we tried the huckleberry bread pudding with creme anglaise. This should be full of berries and wasn't. It was a hunk of doughy, leaden bread. The small amount of berries/sauce was very good but the creme anglaise suffered from too much vanilla. Overall, I will dream about the pork/green chili and will go back just for that and the cushy seats.",

They were delicious!  We started off with their green chili pork appetizer. This was my favorite dish of the evening.  It was kind of like a stew with tender chunks of pork simmered in this flavorful green chili stock topped with cheese.  It came in a cute miniature cast iron pot, piping hot with a side of warm, soft, and chewy tortillas.  Yummy!  Had I known how good it really was, I would've just ordered two of these and be happy for the night.  We then had the trout with capers, almonds and brown butter.  This was another winning dish. The capers were deep fried, so a lot of the briny taste disappeared leaving us with these little salty, crispy buds of goodness that perfectly complimented the the entire dish. The trout came with a huge slice of corn bread that was also very delicious.   My hubby ordered the short rib tacos which were full of flavor with plenty of cilantro and zesty sauce to bring it all together.  For dessert, we had the chocolate cake and bread pudding, both of which were good, but nothing extraordinary.  Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area.",

Let's start off in reverse by reviewing the desserts....The banana split, with fried bananas would make even a monkey cry with ecstacy. We were fighting for the last bite. Entrees of roasted duck with sour cherry sauce and sauteed cabbages was delectible. I ate, seriously, every bite. Rickie's fried chicken was juicy and crisp. The seared Ahi tuna with fresh avocado was perfectly prepared. Appetizer fish tacos were fresh, clean and light. All pre dinner salads were crisp and tossed in fantastic dressings. My field green salad, however, was short on beets and the fried goat cheese a bit gummy and luke warm. Service was polite, friendly, although I would enjoy a little more spark and verve from the staff. She seemed like she was sleep walking. Wine list was extensive. Crowd was very family like this evening, with lots of holiday revelery and gift exchange. Great spirited vibe all around. Can't wait to go back. Perhaps I'll wear my t-shirt.

This last visit had been quite disappointing, however. The food was bland, the shrimp weren't cooked properly, an the temperature of our dishes was cold. This was the only disappointment, so instead of 5 stars we will give this a 4.",

It had everything it better have at these prices and in this economy. We had read reviews on Yelp and needed a Mothers Day night out. Made reservations three weeks ago with no hassle, even got a reminder call the day of the event. Nice touch. Got there 8 minutes early according to the hostess who also informed us we would have to wait the 8 minutes. Really?? Big shout out to Stephen the bartender who has the perfect bartender personality. When we were brought to our booth, we noticed the restaurant only about 3/4 full and fading fast. Really, we should have been seated -- come on hostesses, improvise a little. Walk-ins were seated right away. Our waiter was top notch. He made appropriate suggestions and was friendly, and the food was brought on time. We ordered the green chile pork cauldron and it was spectacular -just like all the other Yelp reviews say. She got the roast shrimp -way too salty and the shrimp was beyond chewy and rubbery; it was nearly inedible. The accompanying grits were terrific. I had the fillet with a crab and Bearnaise sauce - really good. No, REALLY GOOD. These guys do meat the right way. We also had a side of spinach with red onions. The flavor was strong and the spinach was freshly cooked. We had the choc lava cake with vanilla ice cream and it was good like all other choclavas around town. We had a hard time giving RF distinguishing remarks. It's all pretty darn good, but we are in the age of asking, 'so what?' when something is just pretty darn good. I recommend RF even though the total experience is a bit forgettable.",

They had a special going on, caesar salad, filet mignon and desert which she ordered and I had the wedge salad, braised ribs and asparagus. In no time our salads arrived and both were very good. Our dinners arrived a bit later and both were great. Her filet was cooked the way she likes it (medium well) and my braised ribs were cooked to perfection. All in all, a great dinner.",

I stumbled into this restaurant as I was looking on Yelp. I read the reviews and a lot of people said great things about this place. So we decided to go.   The food was amazing. I started my meal with the tortilla soup and was shocked about the presentation on the soup. It looked amazing and I enjoyed the flavor when I was eating it. Then I ordered a small salad. It's a salad. Nothing special. And last I had the half chicken. The chicken had a lot of flavor and a side of cornbread that came with it. Both items were very tasteful.   The price was very reasonable. I thought it would be more because of the look inside the restaurant. It wasn't the case. Service was excellent as they took really care of me and my guest.   When I come back to Phoenix, I'm definitely coming back here.",

    "text": "There's a learning curve to this place - for one, get there early, otherwise you will have to hover and then vulture down upon someone who is just leaving (I was not prepared for this during my first attempt of dining here, but came prepared - and at 4:30 pm - the following night and was able to score a seat outside on the patio). The patio tables are only four tops, which made me feel like a little bit of an ahole since I was in Scottsdale on a work trip and was here solo, but c'est la vie; it was gorgeous out and the outside space was perfect.   I arrived with plenty of time to enjoy happy hour, and decided on the green salad and grilled fish tacos to eat, as well as a glass (which quickly turned to two glasses - hello, I was eating alone) of the $5 happy hour Cabernet Sauvignon, which was delicious.   The salad with feta and candied walnuts ($6 for HH prices) arrived first and was delicious, followed by the grilled fish tacos ($10) that were some of the best I've ever had. I do wish I had the huckleberry margarita, as basically everyone around me ordered it and it looked AMAZING. Because I was there by myself and everyone probably assumed I was stood up on a Tinder date, I played into it by ordering the creme brulee for dessert, which had a perfect hard shell and was absolutely delicious (and well worth the four miles I had to run the next day to work it off).   The service was also good - my server was attentive (probably pitying the fact that I was eating there alone, so he was very quick to offer a second glass of wine and dessert menu), and to bring me the check at the end of my meal. For everything I ordered, because of the phenomenal happy hour prices, my bill was $36, with an $8 tip, I ate all of that for under $50 (not sure if I should be proud of that or not).   This will definitely be in my rotation for future business trips to Scottsdale, especially now that I know it does pay to get there early.",

    "text": "This review is long overdue. We dined here months ago for a birthday celebration. Service was great and there were no complaints about the food while we were there. I ordered the salmon with spinach. The salmon was seasoned and cooked to perfection. However, while eating the spinach, I noticed it had a funny taste to it. I tried finishing it, but I began to have stomach cramps. I blew that off as if it were no big deal.  To keep this short, within hours, I felt like I was on my death bed. I had terrible food poisoning and I was sick for a couple days. Please understand that I think this is a wonderful place to dine and things like this can happen at any restaurant. However, my review is based on the response I received from an email sent notifying management of this issue. I was very clear in stating that I wasn't looking for anything, but that I had some concerns with whether or not anyone else had become ill from the spinach. I believe it was the spinach because my mother ordered the salmon with a different side order and was not affected.  My response from this location, was that there are two chefs who taste test the food daily, no one else reported an illness and that they would give me a gift certificate for my troubles. All I wanted was an apology and to be asked if I were okay. I responded explaining that and letting them know how disappointed I was with the way the situation was handled. A response was never received. Btw, if they were truly going to offer a gift certificate, one should ask for an address or send out via email. This left a bad taste in my mouth, so I probably will not dine with an establishment that refuses to take the time to show a little compassion again.",

Smooth, sweet, perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Very impressive, I'll be back this week. I would have given 5 stars but the black beans that came with the tacos were just a touch salty.   I came back the same week for happy hour. The green chili pork kettle was AMAZINGLY and I can't stop thinking about it. Good with the fresh tortillas or even just chips.

I came here for dinner with co-workers and the experience was fabulous! It is an intimate, cozy, romantic restaurant. I started off with the Huckleberry Margarita - it was pretty strong and couldn't finish it, but highly recommend!  The complimentary cornbread was moist and warm and full of goodness. The fresh guacamole and chips, rotisserie chicken flat bread, and the kettle of green chili pork was full of flavor!  I was already starting to get full, but I had to order an entree - the sugar-cured duck breast with green chili mac & cheese! So much food, not enough room in my tummy! You have to order the duck and the mac & cheese - it was the highlight of the night for me! It was ridiculously yummy...  I wish I saved room for dessert, but I didn't. Normally, very rare as I usually save room for dessert. This time, the food was just so good that I couldn't stop. I did not want to stop!

In Scottsdale, and at this price point, I really expect a lot more from wait staff and customer service.  Portion sizes were outatanding.  Trout dish was exceptional!  Big @$$ burger was great! Guac, green chili pork kettle, flatbread and short rib were good but not deserving of the price tag. Reading reviews I can understand why so many of the positive write ups come from the happy hour crowd.  At the discount prices these items are spot on, at premium prices you can do better elsewhere. I'd be willing to try this place again but customer service leaves a lot to be desired.  Are staff indentured servants?  God forbid anyone cracked a smile and seemed happy to be there.  At the very least have someone at the hostess station pleasant to greet you.",

    "text": "Made reservations here for my graduation dinner, and honestly did not see the hype.   Atmosphere - The atmosphere had more of a corporate feel to it, with several large business parties and golf buddies dining beside our large family party. Our server was very patient with us and was very attentive.   Food - The food was average yet pricey, with most entrees $20 and up. A few key plates we ordered:   Guacamole and chips ($9-10) -  very fresh but also very small portions. Could probably only serve 1-2.   Big Ass Burger - all hype. Yes, our burger was huge, sparked awe, but when cut, the beef was dry, the bun soggy, and the vegetables slid out on the first bite. Would not try again.   In summary, the food was just mediocre and there wasn't really anything I'd be back for. If anything, it was a cute restaurant to entertain my out of town family. Otherwise I would not be back here again.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Monday night as part of a party of 6 for dinner.  Roaring Fork is located in the bottom level of an office building which wasn't what I was expecting when we got there.  It's also deceivingly large as it wraps a good way around the building.  It's decorated in the old west style with a fireplace complete with spit in the lobby as well as antler chandeliers and barbed wire wrapped around single lights. It was around 6:30 PM whenever we decided to make our reservation here and the earliest table we could get was 8:00 PM and so we went for it.  We ended up arriving at the restaurant at 7:50  PM and were taken back to our table, a 6 person booth, within 5 minutes of that.  For dinner on this evening our table decided to split a couple of appetizers in the kettle of green chili pork as well as the guacamole.  The kettle of green chili was cute whenever it came out as it was indeed in a smallish kettle with some hot buttered flour tortillas next to it.  It tasted really good as well and I loved the large chunks of pork which had a light heat to them on the tortillas.  The guacamole came with a side of tortilla chips which had some green onion and cheese on them.  Both the chips and guacamole were satisfactory although neither was exceptionally good.  Then for my dinner entree I ended up ordering the Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin which came with sides of White Falls Mill Cheese Grits and Mexican Street Corn.  It came out with the four bacon wrapped tenderloin pieces on top of a base of grits with the middle two pieces of pork topped with mexican street corn.  The pork was cooked perfectly and I loved the pork on pork action that came with them being bacon wrapped.  My Mexican street corn was also good as it was charred and consisted of cheese and some green onions.  The most disappointing part of my plate was the grits.  It's not that they were bad as they had a nice creamy texture to them but I wished that they had a little more cheese flavor.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While the location of Roaring Fork may have you scratching your head the food here is quite good.",

We strolled around downtown Scottsdale in the afternoon, checking art galleries and wine rooms and Roaring Fork turned out better than I expected.   We were able to grab the last patio table available for happy hour.  Though it was hot outside, the patio faces east and is well shaded with fans, misters and plants.  Beautiful patio. Intimate but spacious.  Brandon was our server. We arrived at 5:45pm and happily surprised that Happy hour was until 7pm.   We shared the Queso con Puerco. A bit spicy but perfectly paired with the happy hour mojitos. This queso dish comes topped with pork and green chilies, served with corn chips.  What drew my attention to this restaurant was the pork tenderloin dish, on grits, topped with street corn. I knew my husband would love it and it didn't disappoint. Our visit was coming an end, otherwise, we would have brought family back here for happy hour or dinner.    Great for special occasion, date night or simply a fine dining experience. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.",

We split the Green Chili Mac and Cheese for a side. Both of our meals were fantastic, and we easily could have shared an entree (for sure could have shared the Carnitas).

Arrived at 6:15 to check in and was kindly told my reservation was at 5:15. Oh crap, this was totally my fault  and how embarrassing. My parents were with us and in their late 80's so it's not easy moving them to another restaurant. The very sweet hostess told me they would do their best to get us a table so she and probably the manager went to great lengths to seat  us as soon as possible. This is seriously unheard of at busy restaurants. If you are late for a reservation, it's tough luck for you but they went out of their way to make it work.  The food...amazing high class soul food. Think grits and grilled corn meets pork tenderloin medallions. Great balance of flavors. I've never seen such a huge hamburger or a filet mignon that's fork tender.  I would highly recommend Roaring Fork. I would suggest making reservations but don't forget to show up at the correct time!",

Plus the presentation is gorgeous. I ordered the dried chicken. Of the 8, it definitely won everyone as the best dish. Only comment is that I would of loved a green vegetable with it, alone it was quite heavy.  I appreciate that they have a pre fix menu option which is a good deal. There was a wedding party or something going on which made the place super busy on a Thursday but Overall I'd totally go back.",

Happy Hour food & drink were incredible (as usual) - Huckleberry Margarita & Big \"Ass\" Burger this time around. Burger was so big that I needed a knife and fork just to attack it. No way was I going to be able to get my mouth around that piled high \"bun-meat-bacon-cheese-giant green chile-tomatoe-lettuce-onion-pickle\" sandwich. it was lovely! And plate was piled high with great fries too.  But this time my real 5-star impression came from our Server - Sarah. She was super busy, but was able to be on top of every little detail that made our HH experience outstanding. Sarah was there whenever we needed anything. Definitely a Five-Star service experience.  Roaring Fork has a Rewards Program card. Just ask your server. They are open from 4-10. Happy Hour is 4-7. Great HH specials. Go early . . . they get busy!",

Our server was inattentive, zero personality and disappeared halfway through our dinner. Asked for a steak medium rare and it came medium well. I was asked by the server to cut into it to check to see if it was cooked okay (that's new one).  She then offered to bring another...I refused to wait another 20 mins for a new steak while our company would be finished their dinner. There was no accommodation on the bill for that one. Took them 20 mins just to bring the bill and I was already to just about walk out of there 45 minutes before that.  If this is how this place operates their prices should appropriately reflect the mediocre standard.  Honestly this isn't a good one off steak house.  For the price go to capital grill or an equivalent.  I wish I could say it was forgettable but i still have a bad taste in my mouth from the whole experience.",

    "text": "I've been to Roaring Fork several times.  The food is always good but the wait staff and crowd sometimes feels too uptight to me.    We went in Saturday night around 7 pm without reservations.  Seemed to be a big no-no by the response of the hostess.  She said they are full for the entire evening with reservations but we could look around the bar and patio area if we want.  We took a walk around.  There were a couple chairs at the bar that had empty glasses and table cloths still sitting on them from the previous guest.  Rather than bus our own tables as we were seating ourselves we decided to go somewhere else.    I really don't think I will be back here again.  There are too many places that are more laid back and welcoming with the same quality of food.  In fact we left and went to one right around the corner that was just as popular and busy.  No reservation no problem.  We even got sat by a real live person.",

The hostess was busy on the phone so we waited.  And waited. Finally the hostess put down the phone and tersely said only the lounge was open, then got back to the phone. We walked around, the lounge was full, no empty tables, nothing at the bar, so we left (hostess still on the phone) and got a fine meal down the street. It's like they're so popular they'd rather we didn't come by. And so we won't. Update:  Comment from RF:  \"The manager wants to personally apologize\".  But then he never did!   Appears they're OK with my review! Hey, ask yourself how bad was it they walked out on a free meal? Yes, that bad!",

The outside area had this really nice tree decorated with Christmas lights, but the lights weren't overpowering.  Food: A-ok. Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. I thought that it was average at best, mediocre at worse...if that even makes sense. I had the steak and my dining buddy had the salmon.   Service: This is where they lose my business. Service was exceptionally slow. What should have been an hour long meal turned into a two hour meal, and a good chunk of that was us waiting to have our wine order taken, waiting to have our food order taken, waiting to have our dessert order taken, waiting to have our check brought to us, waiting for the to-go boxes. I finally had to go up there and ask the hostess to run my card because I didn't know how long it would take our server to do it. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt, but the place was not busy (it was a Sunday night). No complaints about the hostess or the bussers, they were fine.   Definitely recommend this place if you've never been, but it will be a one time affair for me and my friends.",

Chicken very moist and flavorful and the corn bread stuffing was to die for!  I deduct only one star for location. It is in the middle of office buildings.

I will say that the food was mediocre for the price however.   I ordered the Prickly Pear Mojito and I would not even call this drink a mojito. It tasted like drinking a glass of juice with no mint or rum flavor whatsoever. The green chile mac and cheese is good but nothing I would describe as over the top delicious. I had the grouper for my main meal and I felt the dish was lacking vegetables and balance. I was given a HUGE piece of fish rested on a small pile of spinach. The entire plate was HEAVILY doused in a beurre blanc sauce. Overall, way too salty and not terribly impressive.  The food is ok but definitely not worth the price tag.",

I'm pregnant so didn't get to enjoy any drinks, but my husband had a glass of wine from their more unique wine menu. We've noticed most restaurants tend to carry the same things, but not here, it was pleasantly different!  I had the blackened redfish - delicious, cooked perfect, and the accompanyments were delish. My husband had the bacon-wrapped pork - I didn't try it but he loved it. It came with grits (he's from the south and orders then any chance he gets) and he said they were REALLY good.

Service was perfect.  We ordered appetizers for our dinner and they were all very good.  The flatbread pizza, tortilla soup, steamed mussels and guacamole.   The mussels dish was huge and very good.

Usually a Southwestern theme like theirs can come across as pretty casual, but they manage to make it feel like a classic, upscale lodge and touches like lovely crystal and white table cloths lend to the appropriate high end atmosphere.  Based on other great reviews, we started with the Kettle of Green Chile Pork, which was as amazing as expected. The amount of pork served was more than the initial serving of tortillas could accommodate, so we needed to request seconds so that we could scrape the bottom of the kettle and finish every last delicious tidbit.  Our entrees were the Boneless Buttermilk Fried Chicken (mine), Sugar Cured Duck Breast (hubby) and Rainbow Trout (friend) All were delicious - I particularly loved the peppercorn gravy with my Fried Chicken, which was full of flavor. The Duck that my husband had was melt-in-your mouth tender and flavorful, and the skin on my friend's Trout was too good to leave on the plate (she normally bypasses it but instead it was her favorite part!)   We did order a side of the Green Chili Mac n Cheese which was good, but not life changing.  My memory is a bit fuzzy after all of that amazing food, but I believe we had a huckleberry bread pudding for dessert, which was a great way to end a super yummy meal.   Service was good - not overwhelmingly personal, but attentive and nice.  My hubby works just around the corner, so we nee to head back again very soon :)",

After enjoying the atmosphere and then seeing the great reviews on Yelp, I decided to give it a shot.   The waiter we had was very attentive and knowledgeable. My date and I ordered drinks, including a Sapphire martini, which came with a delicious flavored onion (onion requested). But the highlights were a huckleberry margarita and prickly pear mojito (both recommended).   Where our experience fell off was with the entree that we shared. It was their market fresh halibut with arugula and watermelon. Unfortunately the fish came out over cooked and over seasoned and not seasoned properly, as the ingredients didn't seem to be complementary.   After drinks, a shared appetizer, shared entree and tip, the bill was over $100.00 and I would have rather just skipped the food altogether.  To be fair, this was our first experience at Roaring Fork and we only had one entree between the two of us. I will go back for happy hour and try something else and report back, but as of now, I can only recommend for drinks.",

However, I can appreciate food, especially the \"Big Ass Burger\" that lives up to its name. The thing is ginormous for a typical restaurant burger. Another item I love is the kettle of green chile pork with buttered tortillas. Pair that with a HH margarita and you're doin' just right.  Good restaurant, solid food and service.

It would have been five if a. the hostess didn't give me a \"wtf\" face when I told her I hadn't made reservations for a Tuesday night and b. the door leading to the patio had been shut every time someone walked in and out - it was a bit chilly.   Other than those two sillies, dinner was good! My boyfriend said this was his favorite dinner of our trip. OH, another thing that disappointed me was the limited list of appetizers. Usually I can find at least one thing to start with (I am not picky) but nothing seemed appetizing.   So onto mains we went. Our server was ridiculously nice and charming, Tania was her name. I ordered the shrimp and grits and my man ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin - lots of pig for him!!!!!   My shrimp was solid. I enjoyed the creamy and flavorful grits mixed in with my cut up shrimp, but the shrimp didn't have a ton of flavor. That was totally ok though, as the broth that surrounded it all was garlicky and tasted of the sea! Our server also brought bread to me so that I could sop up all that delicious broth - waste not!   The tenderloin was done perfectly. So....tender.... And the charred corn salsa it came with was crisp and sweet, a wonderful compliment to the salty bacon!   For dessert we went with the creme brulee. It was your standard dessert, nothing that put us over the edge, but delicious nonetheless.",

    "text": "Too many people gave this restaurant a high review for us not to try it on our first trip to Scottsdale.  Did not live up to expectations.  Starters were good, bread (2 types) was nice, caesar salad had very fresh and large anchovies topping it which was a pleasant change from that traditionally served in other restaurants.  The missing piece was the entrees.  I had the seared ahi special served over crab fried rice.  Way too salty.  So over the top it masked all of the other flavors.  Didn't even attempt to eat 1/2 of it due to this issue.  Waitress highly recommended pork shoulder carnitas to my husband.  Half of it was fat and the flavor was lacking any spunk.  He (a carnitas expert) did not enjoy it.  Would never return.  Waste of a night out with too many other highly recommended restaurants we should have gone to instead.",

Our server was energetic and helpful with deciding on the 22 ounce ribeye. We also got the rainbow trout which was phenomenal!! Every bite was delicious from beginning to end. I was brought their signature pecan pie for my birthday dessert, which was a nice surprise. I'm not a fan of pie but it was rather tasty. We will be back! The pricing isn't too bad either!",

You get food off their regular fantastic menu at a discounted price and they don't skimp and give you tiny portions like many places do for happy hour. I shared the \"big ass burger\"  and the green chili pork and they were both really good. The burger really is huge but really good and comes with fries. The green chili was good spicy and flavorful and I want to go back for more!   Drinks, they have about 5 signature drinks for happy hour that are $5 and a few wines as well. Great value. The guava mojito was amazing and I could have had several! The margarita was a dissappointment, too much sour mix. Stick with the mojitos! They are great. This really didn't feel like happy hour with the full meal we had at such a great price for such a nice restaurant. Service was good and not pushy or trying to rush you at all which is a nice change! I will be back very soon!",

OK, by \"find food\" I mean food that will please all, such as one can find at this new American meets char-grilled bourgeois chain with its massive menu.  So for me, this has been a kind of safety net for culinary dilemmas.  I've eaten the mac-n-cheese and other nom noms at the Austin location, and I've eaten at this location both for the \"burger/bar\" experience and the full on dinner extravaganza.  Much of the food is way above average, and described in detail elsewhere.  On my last dinner trip, we had the scallops and the plank-grilled fish special.  Both were well executed, although I can't tell you anything specific about the flavor profiles.  That in itself says something for me.  Not that it's not good or not worth it, but that it's not \"special.\"  I can still tell you what I ate at Citizen Public House a year ago, but not this meal from a month ago.  But the burgers are amazing.   And the lamb app is fun.    I will say that as a dining experience this location feels like a cattle call, a kind of high-priced assembly line production with solid food, rushed service, and faux veneer on multiple levels. For me, this is the place to sit at the bar and get a burger and a glass of wine or beer in the afternoon, and perhaps an app.  As a dining experience, it's a bit cold an anonymous, not helped by the expansive interior.  The bar in Austin, just from a vibe level, is much more suited to my tastes.  And in Texas, at least the platinum-blonde dye is REAL.  :-0",

The salad non-choice was some fresh greens with what was a tasty vinaigrette that unfortunately was in short supply.  Entree choices were organic rotisserie chicken, grilled salmon and a Dr. Pepper beef short rib with tomato jam..  I went with the short rib and found it both good and disappointing.  The good was the fall off the bone quality of the meat itself plus the flavor of the meat and the less good was that it was kind of small, and too fatty.  Judging from the conversations around the table, sounds like the chicken was the way to go.  Dessert was an ancho-chocolate torte that was really pretty good and I'm not even really a sweets kind of guy.  Walking to the banquet room we were in, I got to see some orders coming out to other tables and I saw some things that looked really good, including a delicious looking thick steak with some compound butter melting on top.  I would have ordered that in a heartbeat had it been one of our choices.  Service for the team meal seemed to be kind of slow with longer than should have been periods in between each course.",

Our order was as follows:  - Complimentary Bread Basket - comes with rolls and mini corn bread muffins... Very tasty actually. Comes with a plate of 2 types of butter which I confused for cheese and pate (the butter was cut in wedges... My bad) - Green Chili Pork with Tortillas  (appetizer) - delicious and full of flavor. Generous portion. Would order again in a heart beat. It is topped with melted cheese. My photo does it no justice.  - Half Roast Chicken (entree) - comes with really tasty corn bread stuffing and veggies. Chicken was cooked very well. Not dry at all. Only was to make it better would be to find a way to improve the chicken skin flavor which was good, but not fantastic.  - Green Chili Mac 'n Cheese - good lord this was good. It has some crunchies on top which just pull it all together. Creamy cheese, a little green chili spice, perfect pasta with a delicious crunch for texture.   All in all, I would happily come back if I'm  in the area. Sadly I'm a visitor but thank you yelp for helping me find this place!",

Their jalapeno mac & cheese alone is worth visiting, but there are a lot of other delicious treats on the menu too. If you're a vegetarian, ask the server what your options are, there aren't many on the menu which is why its getting three stars from me. Once I asked my waitress about vegetarian options she told me all the dishes that could be converted to vegetarian which I greatly appreciated.   Their wine selection is absolutely amazing though, lots of delicious, quality wines for you to enjoy. I'd visit this place again if I'm back in the area!",

We hung out in the bar area while waiting for our table. Immediate service... woot. woot. What? Table ready early? woot. woot. woot. Drinks were brought to our table and we examined the menu.   I was having a difficult time deciding on what to get until I saw the RF Mixed Grill... Baby Back Ribs, Bacon wrapped Quail and Prawns. Roasted Corn side with a dollop of mashed potatoes.. look no further I am sold. The prawns were slightly over cooked but that did not bother me as the quail was friggin awesome. I am noticing a bacon theme here in Scottsdale and I endorse it 125%. The boyfriend got the teriyaki cedar plank salmon which was inhaled in seconds. The lamb shank is ridiculously huge... it looks like a turkey leg on steroids. I had a bite and it was also well cooked (not super gamy in taste). The grilled asparagus side is huge and can easily be shared between 2-3 people.   Dessert... Creme Brulee how I love you so.... the birfday girl got a Mexican Vanilla Creme Brulee and it was perfect... the custard was sweet but not too sweet and the brulee was a wonderful golden brown thin layer of crispy sugar goodness.   Extensive wine list, classic and infusion mixed drinks. I suggest making reservations.. this place is consistently packed.",

I was pleased with our meal - we had a variety of items, and all were very well done. We loved the heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese and arugula. This was probably our favorite thing. We also tried the lamb chop fondue, which was very good, but a little difficult to eat. I'd still recommend it though.  We decided to split the Big Ass Burger, for which I am glad, since it was huge, and it came with fries. This item was so memorable, since I loved the poblano pepper on the burger. Since we were splitting, we also ordered the green chili mac and cheese. This was delicious! I'll definitely try it again.  Very courteous wait staff, and very nice ambient room. I can't wait to go back for half-priced appetizers!",

I ordered the nachos and special steak salad and my BF opted for the restaurant week special ribeye. AMAZING!!  But what really set this above for me was the service staff. Our server was busy, but another server got us started. He was sooo nice. Watching the staff bustle around they were all actively helping one another, something that doesn't happen enough in the service industry in my opinion. The steak on my salad was a little spicy. The server offered to make me a new one without the spice rub, but I decided I could manage. Then the manager actually visited our table to make sure I was ok; another thing that doesn't happen often enough. I am very impressed and definitely recommend this restaurant.",

I tried it and had to take it out of my mouth. The grits were extremely gritty and flavorless. My salmon was okay. The Brussels sprouts tasted blah. It wasn't out of this world.

They have an all night happy hour on Sundays from open to close. Great specials on food and drink. One of the Staples there is the big ass burger with fries for $10. Which is a 10 oz Patty of beef with choice of side. Also enjoy their muscles in a spicy chorizo sauce served with toast points. I would recommend getting the toast points on the side as they get soggy in the sauce. I have also eaten steaks and other dinner's at this restaurant and everything as always comes out correctly. Staff is on point. Bartenders really take care of business and are also in charge of serving the happy hour and bar food. A few of them at work there for 10 plus years which shows it's a good place for employment. Management is on point and always around if there is a problem. If you've never check this spot out and you're in the Old Town Scottsdale area definitely come by and check it out especially for their great happy hour. Also during 4 months of the summer they run the happy hour special every day all night all day. Call to check the dates",

I am a single guy who enjoys a nice night out so that often leaves me by myself finding a place to sit at the bar. Sitting at the bar alone never bothers me. But once bartenders find out that I don't drink alcohol, it certainly bothers them.   MOST and I am saying most for a reason. Most bartenders respect my wishes to not want to drink and leave me alone. While at Roaring Fork the bartender asked me at least a dozen times throughout my meal if I wanted to see a drink menu. Each time I said no I don't drink I was met with a huge eye roll and some little comment. Just because I do not drink doesn't mean I don't take care of the bartenders. I am usually a 25%-30% tipper on an average night. But this guy just couldn't leave me be.   The food was decent, nothing spectacular. My steak came out medium when I asked for it rare but I didn't want to even begin to try and go through that process with the bartender I had.   Overall it's frustrating when places make you feel super unwelcome just because you didn't feel like drinking and driving.   I can't give my business to a restaurant that allows employees to act like that. Hard pass for me.",

Beautiful antler chandelier. Gorgeous lighting. However, Entrance in was weird as it is in a commercial area. Therefore, I think this really is an excellent location to take out of town visitors for business. Food: I am absolutely impressed. My husband did the AZ Restaurant Week; he got the Caesar salad, 16 oz Delmonico medicine rare steak with asparagus and potatoes and creme brulee. I decided to take advantage of their practically all day Sunday happy hour. If you are reading this for restaurant week. Do what we did. Best of both worlds!!!! Steak was perfectly charred on the outside. Closer to rare instead of medium rare on the inside. Wished for more asparagus, but usually their entrees don't come with sides so I shouldn't complain. Best seasoned mashed potatoes ever! They use the jus from the strain as a thin gravy. DELISH! Drinks were surprisingly well priced for this location in Scottsdale for happy hour. Service: We walked in 10min before our OpenTable reservations. But because we wanted the Happy Hour we wanted to seat ourselves in the bar area. Our hostess was excellent. Our server, Amanda, is absolutely fantastic! She dined here before she worked here. I think that shows the quality of the service: you'd want to work where you and your customers are treated right.  All out: I will be back. I will take friends and family here anytime they are visiting me!!!!",

I am sure this is frustrating for the restaurant staff as well. After about an hour and a half wait we finally were finally able to get a table and order drinks and food. The happy hour drinks are $5 and the they have a great happy hour menu as well the tacos and guacamole were great! Really great time and great atmosphere! Love the all night happy hour!!",

The meat was a little too rare for my taste, especially since I asked for medium! Ribs were great!! Easy to come off and great side coleslaw because it had a nice little kick to it. I gave one less star because of ten service. Our waitress had about 6 of us, but she didn't seem to really want to work with us. It just would have been nice to have a little more service such as water being filled more frequently. Great little nook though!",

They have a $10 \"Big Ass\" burger that is really awesome with a huge side of fries and great drink specials. Get there early for Happy Hour though because the bar fills up.

We enjoyed both of the dishes though i thought the pork chops were too thick and too lean. I wish it was thinner and had a bit of fat content.

Their margarita on the rocks and mojitos are also great and available on happy hour. If you are coming in for happy hour, do come earlier. Happy hour is limited to the bar area and front patio, which are open seating. If you arrive well into happy hour, you are unlikely to find a spot. And it feels silly to pay more for the same dish/drink just because you are sitting in a different area of the restaurant. I wish they would extend happy hour pricing to the entire restaurant.",

    "text": "The rustic atmosphere is delightful. Our server was very gracious and helpful. We ordered off the menu that had a choice of three entrees. It included a salad and dessert. We chose the  Ahi Ahi tuna. The chef was gracious to sear it bit extra for us. However the tuna had an incredibly spicy rub on it. It was not noted as such in the menu. I literally could not eat it and had to send it back. So disappointing..The tuna was on a bed of chilled blanched green beans which excellent . Also accompanying the tuna were corn bread croutons. Honestly, I could not see the correlation between the corn bread croutons and the tuna. We chose the pecan pie for dessert. It was excellent with a flaky lard crusty. The accompanying gelato was absolutely delightful. To me, my meal was disappointing but I would definitely go back and give it another try. The area in which the restaurant is located is upscale and seems quite trendy. Wish I had ordered the salmon on a plank. The Ahi tuna gave  me an extremely upset stomach. Will never order that again.",

    "text": "Where do I begin? We were seated at a table by kitchen. We asked to move to a different location and they said there were no more tables available. We ordered our meal, I asked for vegitarian options and the waiter suggested a vegetable plate of sides. Ok. As we sat there and waited for our food to arrive, we watched the food come out on the line. I actually timed on my iPhone a steak that sat there for 5 minutes and 29 seconds before a waiter came to take it. The sides were prepared way ahead of time and sat there under what I am assuming were warmers waiting to be ordered and then served. Hence why when our meal arrived the potatoe side wasn't even lukewarm. As we continued to watch the cooks, both men working in the entree/meat/seafood line were not wearing gloves. One of them clearly had a bandage on his finger and was handling food with his injured finger. The other man I clearly saw picking scabs off of his arm and then handling food as well. Our meal came, my husband ordered a steak and I the vegetables as suggested. When we ordered the waiter said the meat is cooked on wood planks. My husbands steak he said tasted like the smell of fire pit. As I bit into my asparagus, it too tasted like the bonfire we had the evening before. I then became extremely irritated that now I am realizing that my vegetable I ordered where I clearly stated I was a vegitarian was cooked on a wood plank where meat was. We asked for the manager who offered us a free desert. No thank you. We just wanted out of our misery.",

Also, it keeps the visit a bit cheaper, but this is no compromise.  The drinks are reasonably priced, the food, truly fantastic too.  I like to come here with a moderate sized group so that we can try to sample as many of the entrees as possible.    Some of my favorite Happy Hour Menu items are as follows...The Mixed Market Greens salad, Big-Ass Burger, Kettle of Green Chili Pork, the Fish Tacos, and the Chicken and Pepper-Jack Flatbread pizza is beyond wonderful.  You are still able to order dinner menu items from the bar as well, which is nice.  Roaring Fork has a mountain lodge kind of feel and decor, it's relaxed, but usually quite busy.  The bar is first-come-first-serve, so be prepared to stake out for a table.  A great place to start off an evening in Scottsdale.",

The restaurant is located on the bottom floor of an office building and unless you were looking for it, you would probably drive right past it. The prices on the menu can be a bit off putting but I would say worth it if you enjoy a good meal.   As an appetizer we shared fried avocado, for no other reason than to try it. It came topped with fresh crab meat, the avocado is coated with an egg wash and then rolled in bread crumbs before its fried to produce a delightful this crust. I would definitely order that again.   I had the sugar cured duck breast and my girlfriend had the bacon wrapped pork sirloin. I love duck and this one was very tasty, this particular piece had more fat on it than usual but no complaints. The cure cured skin was crispy and sweet. The tenderloin melted in our mouths, so ridiculously good.",

    "text": "We were excited to try Roaring Fork and especially for the all day Monday happy hour pricing. It was a disappointment.  Service was fine, it was the food that was not good. We were glad to have only paid the reduced happy hour prices, but it was so bad, that it was not even worth those prices.  We ordered: Pork Wings, Grilled Fish Tacos, and the Roaring Fork Big Ass Burger.  The pork wings were fine, not too exciting. The sauce was like a sweet marinara, not what we were looking for from the Dr. Pepper BBQ description.  The fish tacos were ok.  The remoulade was tasty as were the vegetables, but the fish was very plain. Even at happy hour prices, this was 2 fish tacos for $10... so $5 per taco... so they should have been great or at least good. They were fine, but only worth a buck a piece.  The burger was a real problem. We ordered it medium rare and it came out rare, like cold in the center rare. They graciously refired it, but it was not to be fixed (still rare on the refire). So they made us a new one - which was not medium rare, and not medium, but well done, as in hockey puck well done.  At that point we just gave up.  It was a bust of a dinner.   We left disappointed and having spent $46 before tip on ho hum food.  Definitely skip this one.",

As you step in, you are greeted warmly and professionally by the staff.  The decor is very nice and classy, and not overly pretentious.    There is a nice variety on their menu to please everyone.  Well maybe not everyone, I did not see if they had a good vegetarian selection but pretty much a good place to bring friends who dun eat certain meats, like beef or seafood.  I had their RF Mixed Grill, which I highly recommend to anyone.  It gives u a sampling of all that is good at this place.  U really cannot disapprove of baby back ribs, chicken, shrimp and sausage.  all nicely cooked in a wood fired grill.  And all for only 24 bucks.  thats actually very comparable to a dinner at many chain restaurants, like outback steakhouse or even olive garden but without the tackiness and crowd you find at a chain restaurant.  We had a big group and everybody loved what they had, be it the buttermilk fried chicken, pork carnitas, or dr pepper baby back.  All were good and everyone were happy.  For appetiziers we had the really well cooked green chilli pork and, amazingly lamb chops and fondue.  I never knew fondue could be this good with lamb chops.  U would think an overwhelming combination as one is rich and the other oily, but it was really a tasty combo.  I think folks who come here expecting mastro would be genuinely impressed with the excellent service and relatively lower price.  Definitely a place to come to for a change if you are someone who is bored of chains like outback or olive garden or buca di beppo.",

My husband got the duck confit. He got two Heinekens for $5 each, and I got a tasty prickly pear mojito. We split the creme brulee for dessert.   The food took a little longer than I would have liked, but my husband's duck was very good. I wasn't thrilled with the carnitas, but I think it's because I had my heart set on the spare ribs.

    "text": "Everyone I knew spoke so highly of the Roaring Fork that I couldn't wait to get to Arizona and try it out. Needless to say I was disappointed. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very unique and different and has a mountain type vibe to the decor. The place is always packed and we couldn't get in until about 830 on a Sunday night.   The food is overpriced to say the least. Side dishes are all $7 and the french fries were a disgrace. The menu was limited but did feature a wide array of fish.   The friend chicken was dry and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a good amount of time. The braised ribs were average and a little went a long way. The sides overall were horrid and the service was shotty to say the least.   The banana desert was a home run! One of the best desserts I have ever had and I highly recommend it!   I may give the Roaring Fork another shot if I am in town again because of the dessert. Maybe I ordered the wrong dishes, who knows.",

    "text": "Yelp guided us to another yummy dinner in AZ. We tried to find a place that would have some delicious and yet sensible options and just could not get past the good reviews and a few of the OH SO GOOD sounding menu options. We both knew what we were going to order before we even left the hotel.   This place in is an office building complex off Goldwater and Scottsdale Blvd. Our GPS took us a funny route, but we avoided all the craziness of a Friday night in downtown Scottsdale. We did make a reservation, and glad we did, as it was quite crowded inside and out when we arrived. The patio is first come first served, so that could have been an option. It was a little chilly, and the patio was full, so we waited about 5 minutes from our arrival to be seated inside.   The menu looked great. Some rather creative dishes with a southern/comfort food type flare. Lots of pulled meats and ribs and spices. YUM. I had already chosen a dish based on reviewers comments, but the menu did look so appetizing that I was tempted to change. Instead, I just added a Waldorf chicken salad to my order to go with the green Chile Pork appetizer. SG was not swayed by the menu, though he did agree that lots of items looked great. He ordered the Dr Pepper BBQ sauce Rack of Ribs. These are country style and the meat literally falls off the bone.   We were quickly brought out some sweet warm rolls with butter and a chipotle butter spread. Creative for sure. The rolls were so fresh and tasty. The Green Chile Pork came out first in the coolest little cast iron kettle. It was served with tortillas, though I do not think it needed them at all. We each had some and saved some to have the next day. WOW, delicious. A little spicy. Very tender and just good. I could have had only this and been perfectly content. (Once I put this aside a server came and offered to box it up for us, talk about on the ball!)   The main courses came, ironically the salad for me and the ribs for SG. Everything looked great. The server/kitchen took extra special care to put things on the side for me, which I really appreciate. My Waldorf was great. It had egg, mixed lettuces, dates, apples, grapes, and huge pieces of pulled chicken breast. The onion dressing was the perfect addition to this salad and it was just great. SG found that the meat was very fatty and spent a great deal of time cutting off the fat. This is understandable on ribs, but a bit frustrating when almost half the meat is fat. The sauce also was not as Dr Peppery as he had hoped, but still good. The meat was very tender and quite good, but for $25, he thought it could be better.   Overall this place is a 4+, not quite a 5. The service was excellent. The staff is very helpful and great. The owner even came by to make sure everything was to our liking. Nice touch. There are lots of restaurants to try in the area, but we would definitely come here again. Make sure to make a reservation (especially during spring training.)",

The Big Ass Burger is BIG.  I don't think I could finish it on my own, and I am a burger guy!  We split it in quarters and shared it.  It was delish!  What else?  The pork stew thing was my favorite and the Lamb Chop fondue dish was decadent!  I would say it is a bit more pricey than most Happy Hours, but then again, the quality is pretty high!  The crowd was a little more...  conservative than I normally like but all good right?",

He loved everything including Moose Drool beer which not a lot of restaurants serve.  I had the salmon with mushrooms which was perfect.    Great food and service, nice atmosphere.

I am just a mojito lover!   Okay and now there is the delicious food!  The reason you go with a group is so you order alot of the happy hour menu so you can try everything!  There is the guacamole, the queso dip and roasted tomato salsa.  Those two are great to eat with your first drink.  Then you should order the Fondue with the Lamb chops-DELICIOUS and maybe accompany that with the Kettle of Green Chile Pork with the tortillas!! OMG can you say heaven!!! It is just fabulous. Of course you should be enjoying this round with another drink!  Then for the last round you get the \"Big Ass\" Burger and the Crab Cake!  The burger is fabulous!  It is not my top but its definitely worth the mention and you cannot fault them for that because it is still delicious!  The crab cake is quality not just those typical cakes that are made of all bread and you cannot really tell if its a crab cake.  It is awesomel I like the chipotle butter!  Anyways, that is my suggestion and review of this fantastic restaurant!  I love it!  It is a great deal and the food is quality and fabulous!",

I got a mojito and house margarita that were both tasty and they did not skimp on the alcohol. For appetizers the pork wings are delicious.

So, sit in the bar area. You can order from the discounted menu, or anything off the full menu as well. Cocktails are hit or miss, wouldn't recommend a margarita but the Manhattans are on point. Fondu was superb! Lastly, if you're looking for atmosphere, the motif here is great. Think wooded cabin meets modern industrial, however it's not too over the top and obvious in any stylized decorum that it feels forced or novel, instead classic. I'd suggest this as a great Father's Day or Dad's birthday spot.",

It was great with lots of flavor and variety of ingredients. Only $13 too, really good deal. I felt like I had eaten just the right amount of food & healthy food at that.  We were able to get a table for about 5 or so people on a Monday night, so I guess that's that time to go if you don't want to wait. Everyone else ordered steaks or fish and it all looked and smelled amazing, but I wanted to err on the side of caution since I have a bit of an unpredictable stomach and, well, it's not a great feeling to be sick on travel, ya know? If I ever came back here I would probably try the salmon or steak...unfff! Smelled so good!",

The drinks, the food and the service has typically been excellent. But our recent visit a few days ago was disappointing, and I'm concerned that this may be indicative of a overall decline in quality. Most tellingly, the \"Big A** Burger\"--a renowned specialty of this establishment--was not nearly what it has been in the past. My wife and I both ordered one and, almost simultaneously, complained to each other that the burger had the texture and taste of mediocre meat loaf. Very different  than in previous years; certainly no longer one of Scottsdale's best burgers. Beyond that, the salad I began with looked and tasted like it had been sitting too long in a refrigerator--and it was covered with scallions despite my emphasizing that I could not tolerate onions or scallions or the like, and despite the fact that scallions were nowhere mentioned on the menu. Enough said. I should note that the pecan pie desert was amazing, and the servers were wonderful and made our experience very pleasant notwithstanding the generally lowered quality of the food.",

Also I got the carnitas with a side of asparagus instead of buttered tortillas. Even though they did charge and extra $3.50 for 3 asparagus spears, all the food was amazing. The server, Amy, who helped us was a total doll as well. Kudos to her and the cooks. A great Birthday dinner!!  Oh and they hooked us up with an amazing deep fried banana-stuffed tortilla (that kinda tasted like a churro) and ice cream (to make a mexican bana split) and it was seriously the MOST yummy dessert I have had... maybe ever.

They have quite a large open area in the back as well as a cozy patio.  My only complaint was the men's bathroom was 100 yards away, but they're at the mercy of the building they're in.  For food we tried like five of the appetizers, I was impressed by all of them.  I loved everything I ate that night and even enjoyed a couple of their cocktails.  Truly it's a 4.5 due to the price, but I rounded up because I couldn't really find anything else I didn't enjoy.    Totally worth checking this place out, although I probably won't be back unless it's for happy hour.",

Atmosphere is nice - some cool SW decor, bright, and warm.  The food was delicious. I had the roasted duck breast - it was cooked to perfection, super juicy, with a  yummy mustard, cherry sauce. Mmmm, I am craving it now as I write this! My ceasar salad was the only thing that left something to be desired. I like a good, hearty dressing - since there isn't much else to a caesar salad - and this dressing just did not make the cut. Pretty watered down and lacked that umph. My husband had the mussels for an appetizer and the entire table was instantly filled with such a perfect aroma the moment they were set down in front of him. We each had a bite and loved every part of it! The sauce was so rich and delish! He had the chicken for dinner - another perfect sauce. One friend got the Trout - wow, this will be what I get next time!! It was cooked perfectly, super moist with the flavorful skin still on. Our other friend got the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and he was quite happy with it. The creme brulee was a delightful way to end the meal - not too sweet, super creamy, perfect!  The service was 4 stars. Our server wasn't super friendly, but was attentive enough. I would say it was fine. I think this is where Roaring Fork could have a better rating on Yelp - because the food is spot on, the service experience could be improved upon to create that perfect overall dining experience!",

The 2nd time was with a large group of 20 people.  During both visits I had:  Queso con Puerco, $9 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=bKnbIsW4l8RTkaS9V6WMdQ#bKnbIsW4l8RTkaS9V6WMdQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roar...</a>  Fresh Guacamole, $9  Kettle of Green Chile Pork, $10 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=4BV1eQ1pIjNl_31O18pXnw#4BV1eQ1pIjNl_31O18pXnw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roar...</a>  Pork Wings (Dr. Pepper BBQ Sauce, Hominy, Pickled Vegetables, & Cotija Cheese), $12 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=7oUjMc9Y-to7ukr8hZF66A#7oUjMc9Y-to7ukr8hZF66A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roar...</a>  Big Ass Burger (Poblano Pepper, Cheddar, Smoked Pepper Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, Pickles, & French Fries), $14  Filet Steak <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roaring-fork-scottsdale?select=SlhE1_wI2NJjRWSzL4CUtA#SlhE1_wI2NJjRWSzL4CUtA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/roar...</a>  The Queso con Puerco is melted Cheese with a green Chile Pork added to it.  It's ridiculously good.....and addicting!  Trust me, you won't stop eating it once you have a bite.  The Guacamole is awesome too.  However, I suggest that you give this a try before the Queso con Puerco so that you can taste the full flavor of the Guac.  If you eat the Queso first, the sharp flavors will override the creamy, smooth, subtle flavors of the Guac.  The Guac is outstanding and definitely a must have.  The Kettle of Green Chile Pork is pretty good.  It has similar flavors to the Queso, but without the Cheese.  It comes with Tortillas for dipping, wrapping, stuffing, etc.    The Pork Wings were awesome and very interesting.  They look like a Chicken Wing at first glance, but then you realize it's a Pork Rib cooked/cut to look like a Wing, but much larger.  These are full of flavor and a must have.  The Big Ass Burger is big and sloppy.  The Poblano Pepper and Smoked Pepper Bacon flavors are prominent and offer a unique taste....which is very good.  Very difficult to take a bite of all layers at once...ha!  The Filet has a smokey flavor to it.  It was cooked perfectly and very satisfying.    The service here is outstanding.  Despite being very busy during both visits, we had impeccable service.  Hats off to management and the staff.  Return Factor - 100%",

Our server didn't check up on us much.  The Men's restroom is in the adjoining office building, down the hall, I suppose that is why it is always messy. All that aside, the food was great and the ambience fun. How many restaurants have the Stones and the Doors as mood music? I'll put up with all the little things and continue to eat there often.",

Equally good was the fish tacos, \"Big Ass\" burger, beet salad special, green chili mac-n-cheese, Mexican corn, mushrooms (the seasonal vegetable that evening). We sampled a local wine which was reasonable and delicious (Freitas Red). We will recommend Roaring Fork to any friends heading to Scottsdale!",

The few times he is up for a happy hour, we go here. The happy hour is confined to the bar area (saloon) and the patio. Be cautious of the wait for the indoor seating. The Roaring Fork happy hour is not a secret. Try the patio, you will usually have better luck getting a seat.  My friend only gets one thing: the Big Ass Burger, cooked medium rare. He loves it. The Longhorn cheddar, the bacon, and especially the poblano pepper. He is a little disappointed that over the years, the Big Ass Burger has gone from one pound of meat to two-thirds of a pound. However, this fact does not stop him from devouring the burger. Five stars for the burger.  We split the guac and chips. The guacamole is wonderful and I love the presentation. For me, this appetizer is totally worth $6.   I usually munch on the friend's fries and drink my mojitos, as there are not very many vegetarian options at Roaring Fork. The mojito is decent and the margarita is good too. I'll have to try the Huckleberry marg next time. (I hear it's great!)  All in all, a great happy hour location. Especially since it's 4-7 daily.",

    "text": "Good times - the Old West meets Happy Hour.   We love Roaring Fork's Happy Hour. They do happy hour for a few hours each evening, but on Sunday and Monday nights it lasts all night long.   Their huckleberry margaritas are awesome. It's a frozen margarita topped off with a luscious huckleberry puree (think purple tart blueberry?).   The bar menu is one of the best too. My favorite is the Big Ass Burger. It's a huge burger loaded with smoked bacon and cheddar cheese. It's served with a kettle of crispy fries. Another appetizer we really like is their Green Chile pork stew. It's served hot in a personalized kettle, covered with melted Jack cheese and served with warm buttered tortillas on the side.   Roaring Fork's entire menu is a blend of comfort food and Southwestern flavors. The happy hour is moderately priced, not cheap, but given the quality and quantity of the food, it's still a great value.",

    "text": "Citizens and tourists beware!!! If you happen to need crutches or a cane to get around, avoid Roaring Fork at all cost.  Let me tell you of my experience. To begin with, the parking lot is as far from user friendly as you can get. At 4:40 most of the spots were full and I had to park quite a distance away. I mentioned this to the hostess when I checked in for my 5 pm reservation.  Adding insult to injury, I arrived with my dinner partner who is in a boot and on crutches do to a fractured ankle. Clearly, the hostess could see she was disabled. None the less, the hostess showed us to the extreme back of the restaurant. I said to our seater, can you not see that this woman is on crutches, can't you seat at a table closer to the entrance, now here was her response, \"I'm sorry sir but we are very dedicated to our reservation\". Under the circumstances that may have been the dumbest response in the history of restaurants. She was dedicated to reservations but not to the disabled customer. I must admit that I lost it with her when she said and I asked to see a manager.  The manager came over, it was a heated discussion to begin with, I told him that I thought it was outrageous that the hostess failed to see that she was on crutches and even more egregious that the seater, non the less took us to the far back of the restaurant to seat up. Furthermore, the seater saying there was nothing they would do because she was only dedicated to the reservations and not the customer in the restaurant, was a clear indication of terrible management. He tried to apologize and I said I wanted him to what happened so no other customer so disabled would have the experience that we just went through. He said he was going up front to make his staff more aware of these types of situations. Ten minutes later a poor guy with a cane, clearly a recovering stroke victim was brought back to the table next to ours to be seated. So much for telling your staff to be more aware, the cane guys wife was not happy as I could hear her complain to her poor husband how annoyed she was that they seated them where they did.   You know, Scottsdale, AZ has a large population of retirees, many with a with disabilities. It seems that Roaring Fork thinks it's great marketing to treat these folks like Lepers and put them out of the sight of their more healthy clientele.  To be fair and balanced, the fish tacos were great, the Salmon, partially raw.",

My favorite appetizer is the kettle of green chile pork, which I could probably just finish off by myself. I've tried the roasted chicken and buttermilk-fried chicken on two occasions, and both are great. One is obviously better for you, but the fried chicken is a guilty pleasure I have no shame in ordering. They also have a great happy hour which is great to enjoy on the patio, but it fills up quickly, as they open at 4pm. I can't wait to get back here soon!",

We had never been here before, but we thought we would try it out for Valentines Day since it was nicer than your average restaurant, but still not too dressy or formal. The whole staff was impeccable, they handed out roses to the ladies as they walked in and the manager and assistant manager went around the restaurant asking people how their meal was and if everything was okay.   Okay, now on to the food! We decided to try the prime rib and Dr. Pepper baby back ribs for our main course and we also got a side of green chili mac and cheese, which we had heard rave reviews about. The prime rib was so tender and juicy and the baby back ribs were sweet and meaty. The ribs came with fries that were nice and crispy and the green chili mac was so tasty and flavorful, definitely a must try. We usually don't finish all of our food when we go out, but the meal was so delicious that we finished every bite on our plates and even licked our fingers clean when we were done! We even managed to stuff down some Huckleberry bread pudding for dessert that was just as amazing as the rest of the meal. I know that we will definitely be coming back here again to try some of the other items on the menu.   4.75/5",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate here on Saturday February 18th. We were visiting Scottsdale for President's Day weekend. We found a sweet deal on a nice hotel and I wanted to eat somewhere affordable, but still have a nice dinner. I went through many yelp reviews and checked out websites. I read many great reviews about Roaring Fork and it wound up winning due to the Green Chile Mac and Cheese evoking our curiosity. We did not have reservations and called to see how long the wait was right before we headed down there. There was very little wait, but we wound up just sitting in the bar. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was great. It was upscale, but somewhere I could still wear jeans to.    Upon walking in we were greeted by a GIANT wooden door and behind it wonderful smelling mesquite chicken being roasted in a huge fire. The warmth and wonderful smells were welcoming. We decided to order the Big Ass Burger because I had read that it was 1/2 LB, plenty for two people to share. That came with fries and we ordered a wedge salad and a side of Green Chile Mac. The hamburger was seasoned well and surprisingly very moist for being over an inch thick. They split it for us without extra charge. The Green Chile Mac is served in a small cauldron and is the best Mac we have ever had. It is better than Duckaroni, better than Lobster Mac....SO FREAKING GOOD! The service was fantastic and more than expected for bar seating. It was the perfect amount of food for two people and even after a drink or two, the bill came out around $60.00. We had plenty of space, weren't rushed and it was quiet for the bar section. It was a great date night and we will be coming back on our next trip to AZ.",

Since they changed the GM, the food has become very inconsistent. For example, I ordered the Rotisserie half chicken that was so over cooked the thigh & leg separated with the breast when served. The green chili pork stew served tonight was very over cooked and they changed the wonderful small flour tortillas with off the shelf corn - bad idea. Several times ago, I was so freezing that I asked to have the AC raised. I was told that the GM was there and he likes it cold - lady next to me put her sweater on. Net, the GM was only interested in his comfort not that of his customers.  It makes me really sad to see one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale going down the path of oblivion!",

It is 2 tacos, each with a good sized piece of grilled fish and the burger comes with all the goodies, including fries.

You can't make mac & cheese like this at home (yes I have spent the last hour googling for it and by all accounts, every food blogger fails to replicate it at home). The sauce is perfectly velvety smooth with a bright spicy flavor (and bright green color) and a lovely crunchy breadcrumb topping. It is perfection and it's served in the cutest little skillet. Everything else we had wasn't as good, but still worth mentioning. For vegetarians (like me) you can pick an assortment of sides and they'll serve it all together on a plate with some stuff mixed into hollowed out tomatoes.  - Mexican Street Corn: I was expecting corn on the cob on a stick covered in mayo and cheese, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a very flavorful corn off the cob. The corn was fire roasted and mixed with yummy cilantro and garlic. It was quite delicious and I would recommend this side dish to anyone. - Black Bean Puree: Awesome. They used cumin quite liberally in this dish so it was very flavorful. Even my boyfriend, who up until this meal claimed to dislike beans, liked it. - Green Chili Mac & Cheese: See introduction. You must get this dish! - Roasted Vegetables: A misnomer. They were steamed/sauteed vegetables and were fine. I was expecting a deep roasted flavor so it was a little disappointing to just get steamed squash, but that's okay. - Fish Tacos: My boyfriend's mom got these and liked them a lot. She said the dish was very fresh and the pesto sauce was a unique and yummy addition to regular fish tacos. - Fried Chicken: My boyfriend ordered this and liked it, His mashed potatoes were delicious. - Huckleberry Margarita: A fun concept. It's a regular frozen margarita with a jam-like puree of huckleberry that you mix together. I liked them a lot but perhaps ordered too many because I felt a little hungover later. - Huckleberry Bread Pudding: Amazing bread pudding! Roaring Fork probably uses some type of cake bread (maybe pound cake?) because the bread pudding was so soft and silky and tasted very strong of birthday cake (in the best possible way). The berry flavor wasn't really there but added a nice pop to a few bites. The vanilla ice cream served with it had a very strong french vanilla taste which went perfectly with the birthday cake-tasting bread pudding. Yummy!  I would highly recommend bringing out of towners here (it has a fun southwestern/cowboy vibe, fancied up) or coming on a date. The food is quite good and reasonably priced for a James Beard award winning chef.",

However much like Gabi M. the Sunday night Happy Hour has won me over.   After a day by the pool my buddy and I were driving around trying to think of somewhere different in Old Town to eat. Now we are wearing board shorts and not dressed for your typical night at RF but we gave it a shot anyway.   We walked in and sat right at the bar. We were greeted by bartender Ryan who was awesome. He offered us the great happy hour menu which included some of the better Green Chile Stew I have had $5 glasses of wine that you can't beat. We had 6 glasses total and an entree each and our bill was $35, you can't beat that. If you are looking for a well priced meal with a good server head to RF and ask for Ryan behind the bar you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "After reading all the wonderful reviews of this place, we decided to get a babysitter for the night and plan a date night...  First off, can I just say this is the strangest location of any restaurant that I've ever been to? It's like shoved into the side of an office building. We drove by it thinking that there was no way a restaurant there. Sign looks like it says, \"Roaring Pork\" in the day time.  As we go in, the ambiance looks pretty cool, a bit dark, lots of cowboy and western decor, very modern. The waitress (Dawn) was very friendly and made so many great suggestions from the menu. She talked me into the Hukleberry Margarita. Mmmmm, very tasty and got my head warm after a few minutes.   We ordered the Rainbow Trout and Bacon Wrapped Tenderloin with 2 Mixed Green Salads. Side of asparagus as well.    I'm sorry, but the Rainbow Trout was super oily and bland. I guess my idea of Trout is dry and flakey with a punch of flavor. Total miss. The Tenderloin was moist, but tasted strange, like it was cooked in bad wine... and partially raw. Another big miss. The asparagus tasted like it was just cooked in butter and tossed with some pepper on top, nothing special. Our salads were drenched (and I mean drenched in vinaigrette dressing), it was like someone threw a bottle of dressing in there. Total bill came to $100 for the entire thing. Hubs and I agree that there was just something weird about the taste of the food here...   i believe I said: \"It's almost like the food does not reveal it's own flavor, it's as if the cooks disguises them in oil and wine and it destroys the dish\".  Maybe it was the dishes we tried, but I don't know if I want to come back again.",

The bread and butter was yummy! The agave margarita was very smooth and good, just one hit me hard. I ordered the braised short ribs, and the hubby had the big ass burger.  I really liked my meal, the short ribs were great, a little too fatty, but thats just the cut of meat I think.  I will order the regular mashed potatoe next time because the horseraddish was too much.  The hubby's burger was good, something on it put it right on the line of being over salted, but it was still enjoyable.  The creme brulee was very very good, one of the best we have had.",

All I can say is \"Lucky for  me and my team\"!  There were about 9 of us and we pretty much all had something different, which ended up being a good deal for all of us.  We shared and tasted everything and there wasn't one item from the appetizer (i.e. green chili pork) to the dessert that any of us could say a bad thing about.

    "text": "This place gets an A+ It's got everything you want from a contemporary American place:  1.  Traditional fare done right (Ceasar salads, Ribs, Shrimp) 2.  Unique, new offerings (Deep Fried Avocado + Crab? Yum!) 3.  Local flare (Southwestern spirit) 4.  Fresh seafood, tender meat, ripe avocados 5.  Great cocktail variety  As of this posting I have visited the roaring fork twice and loved it both times.    Their Ceasar salad ranks among my favorites, not only because of the dressing's perfect consistency but also because of the homemade cornbread croutons (they are almost good enough on their own).    The Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos are ...  well I don't have words to describe how much I loved them.  Fish was warm, fresh, and perfectly fell apart upon biting, with a zesty chipotle dressing and all the accoutrement included and prepared for easy consumption.  Shrimp Cocktail, Ahi Tuna with Crackers, and Green Chile Pork Kettle.  All good.  And loved the fried avocado and crab.  I mean really.  This place has nailed modern cuisine by serving up dishes that intrigue and satiate the palate.  Rinse it down with a nice Sweet Carolina (Sweet Tea Vodka + Lemonade), or enjoy one of their many margaritas.   I look forward to future visits.",

    "text": "Though a couple of hiccups could've ruined the night, Roaring Fork took great care of my boyfriend and me and the food was delicious to boot (ha, boot. Get it? cuz it's western? Never mind).  We were surprised at how busy they were on a Tuesday night, but we were able to snag a table on their beautiful covered patio. The atmosphere was nice, and i was surprised at the range of patrons (a family of 5 with 3 fairly young children at one table, and a 10-top of blue hairs right next to us). Our server Charlie was very nice and helpful when it came to selections (from wine to food). We are trying out places in prep for a family visit, so we want to make sure we get a good sapling of the menu.  We ordered a bottle of sauv blanc, and though the wine was delicious, it took about the half the meal for Charlie to bring out the marble chiller. Thankfully the wine started out pretty cold, so no harm no foul. I orderd a bowl of tortilla soup (one of my faves) and I was impressed witht he presentation and taste. The bring the bowl with the chicken and tortilla strips out then pour the broth from a pot right at your table. Helps keep the tortilla strips crisp and was a great presentation. The soup was delicious, though a little creamier than i normally like my tortilla soup. We also ordered the seared ahi with guac and THAT was amazing. The pepitas crackers were delicious and interesting and the ahi was perfect. Great app for sure. Plus, the bread and butter were super delicious too. Garlic biscuits, mini corn bread and pepper butter? so good!  For entrees the boyfriend ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits and I ordered the signature Dr. Pepper BBQ Baby Back Ribs. We subbed fries for asparagus and green beans and ordered an extra side of their green chile mac and cheese. I know, a lot of food, but we planned on taking most of it home. Here's where it got interesting. Or should I say, boring.   So far everything (except the chiller) had been delivered timely and was tasty. But when we realized we'd been waiting 30 mintues or so for our entrees to come (after they'd taken away our apps), it started to get a little annoying. After about 40-45 mintues, the manager came over and leet us know our tray of food had been dropped and had to be re-made. No problem! I understand accidents happen. But i think it would've done a lot to smooth us over if they'd told us right away the spill had happened rather than waiting until we were about eat the burger off the table next to us. RF did recognize the inconvenience though and completely took care of us when the bill came. So props to them for that, and we didn't even complain or ask for any special treatment.  When the food finally arrived, the ribs were OUTSTANDING. the sauce was perfect, not to sweet, not to flat. And the meat was literally falling off the bone. The veggies were all good, but the really show-stopper was the mac and cheese. The crumble top was delicious and the cheese was melted and runny but not stringy or clumpy. Spicy from the green chiles but perfectly reasonable. I want another kettle of them right now. So good. The boyfriends dinner was also good, but i think my ribs and the mac and cheese were really the best part.  We boxed everything up and ordered the huckleberry bread pudding to go. I was disappointed they no longer do the pineapple upside down cake, which so many yelpers have recommended, but I loved the bread pudding as a substitute. the buttery sauce didn't reheat very well at home, but it was still very very good and the ice cream was a perfect complement. I would totally order it again. Like a muffin fresh from the oven, still a little gooey.  Overall, i loved the food and the staff was really apologetic bout the \"incident\". The atmosphere is great and i would definitely come back. Next time, the burger!",

Bread basket had these great little mini cornbread muffins that were hot and delish.  We started with the green pork chile appetizer, served with flour tortillas. Great flavors, with a gentle kick  My daughter and I shared the crab cake. Single, huge crab cake (plenty to share), with 2 sauces and a southwestern pico de gallo. Cleaned our plates.  For the mains:  Trout: sauteed with butter and almonds, light and tasty. Side of the green chile Mac and cheese was a hit  Filet: excellent cut, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Menu said 8 oz, but seemed bigger  Half chicken: I was feeling a bit off from the extreme heat from earlier, so was fooling for simple comfort food, and this hit the spot. Spit roasted, crispy skip, well cooked and juicy inside, sever with veggies and mashed potatoes. Simple meal well executed.  Bar scene was a happening thing, dining room over half full (Monday night, July 2) so must have mostly locals. Good service, great time.",

Little kettle of the stuff with four fresh made tortillas that arrive folded in a white paper bag - hot. 4.7/5 for flavor, quantity, value, and presentation.   \"Big Ass Burger.\"  All made in house. Even the bun and fries. I don't think they keep the cattle there though. Burger was loosely packed, over-cooked, and a bit salty for my taste. But I am a critic. Jen thought it was average too. Also now $13 - was $10 6 mos ago according to other reviews. 2.75/5  \"Huckleberry Bread Pudding.\"  Whoa. Like a hot gooey berry muffin with Ice-Cream. Awesome. Jen thinks it might be her favorite dessert of all time. 5/5  We were a little worried when we saw all the snow-birds in their ivy caps and studded mom jeans. Turned out to be just fine - and the service was pretty special for how reasonably priced everything was. Portions were serious - Jen and I shared everything and were stuffed.

    "text": "My experience at the Roaring Fork during Restaurant Week was peculiar.  It's difficult for me not to take on the judgements of my co-diners, but I'm going to try to limit this to my experience only.  It took FOREVER to get order our drinks and actually receive them.  All I wanted was an iced tea and I received my drink last, and it was given to my co-diner seated 4 seats away from me.  And, while we were waiting for our drinks to arrive incredibly slowly and one-by-one, I started to get really, really hungry.  I'm waiting for the guy to take our order, but he hasn't even brought all the drinks yet, but he has brought a huge basket of bread.  So I start munching on bread, which was so-so.  Finally, he takes our orders for appetizer and entree.  And it takes forever for something of which they probably have a big vat sitting in the kitchen.  But it eventually comes out: 7 green pork chili and a tortilla soup. Except wait a minute, they only brought out 6 green pork chili and a tortilla soup.  So again I wait, and wait, for my waiter to come check on us. 10 minutes or longer after everyone else is served I finally get my appetizer.  And it was really good. Tender pieces of pork in a slightly spicy green chili sauce, smothered with a ton of jalapeno jack cheese, served in a little cauldron with three large buttery tortillas.  But it was enough food to be the entree.  If I had known it was going to be this large, I would have ordered the salad.  Then it takes awhile for everyone to finish, plates to be cleared and entrees to be brought out.  We were seated at 7:30, it's now close to 9.  But then it finally arrives.  My rainbow trout with almond slices and capers with a piece of jalapeno cornbread.  The fish was almost as large as the platter, easily 4 servings if vegetables were included on the platter, but there wasn't.  I'm very curious to find out if this is how they normally serve their food because I'm not used to getting a big plate of meat with nothing else.  Again, it was delicious.  Lightly battered and smokey, it almost tasted meaty it was so rich. This fish was yummerriffic.  Then it's time for the dessert, not that any of us have room for dessert, but it's part of the package.  The server informs us that there are only 3 creme brulee left.  Luckily only two of our crowd wanted this dessert, but it was just another way that I was a little disappointed with the service.  I ordered the Chocolate Lava Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was pretty good.  Not phenomenal, but good.  I loved my food, and maybe I would check out a happy hour.  It's a shame that the service was so mediocre, because this restaurant could easily have won me over with their food.  And I never would have gone here if it wasn't Restaurant Week.",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to dine with some Fabulous Fellow Yelpers at The Roaring Fork last night. While the night was fun and full of laughs, The Fork just didn't deliver.  Our group of 9 people had a dinner reservation for 7:30pm. Let me first hit on our reservation. Because of seating limitations, Jenn W and I had to make 2 separate reservations, and they were made through Open Table. We each noted our reservation with each other's names and stated that we wanted to be seated next to each other. I also noted that we were Yelp members and that we wanted the AZ Restaurant Week menu.  We received a confirmation etc.  The day of our event, I received a phone call confirming our 8PM dinner...umm... no. I explained I set it for 7:30. The girl fumbled around and finally said \"Yeah ok.\" and finally apologized for the oversight. I am SO glad I thought to ask her about the further instructions regarding Jenn W and My table being seated together, because they would have dropped the ball on that too. In my irritation, I finally said \"What other important information do you miss because you guys don't actually read your Open Table reservations?\" more apologies...yack yack.  Fast forward to dinner time!  I arrived around 7pm to meet a few Yelpers for drinks at the bar. I didn't feel comfortable actually sitting at the bar because the seats are jam packed right next to each other... heaven forbid there's a fire! It took a while for the bartender to notice that we actually wanted a drink. He served me a fantastic Zin. I don't know what it was, but it was good!  Our full party arrived and it was dinner time! I was STARVING at that point. We were seated at 2 separate tables that were next to each other. We decided it was silly to sit a foot away from each other and put some muscle into moving our tables together.   Our server, Joshua, took our water order very quickly. Unfortunately, that was about all he did quickly and accurately all night. Our actual drink/cocktail order was painfully slow both in being able to order it and delivery, plus a random diet coke showed up in the midst of our order. At this point we didn't want our drinks we wanted food. A couple of bread baskets were delivered with so-so varieties of bread. My favorite was the cheddar bacon biscuit. It was just interesting to me. After we depleted our carb baskets, we hoped that our food order would fare better and get to us quickly.  It was time for the first course. Everyone's first course was delivered except for one. Jenn W was left to sit and wait an unreasonable amount of time for her order. In fact, instead of making sure everyone had what they needed, our waiter delivered another table's appetizer first and walked away. BIG NO NO. Jenn finally received her order and I could finally dig into my food without guilt.   I ordered the green chile stew. Fantastic! I loved it. It had the right amount of spicy kick. The meat was tender and not at all fatty, and the tortillas that came with it were hot and buttery. I could have just gone straight to dessert after that. I was very pleased with my appetizer.  What goes up must come down right? Well my blissful high was broken up by my boring rotisserie chicken meal. I was hoping that the chicken might be moist and smoky, or maybe rubbed with some interesting spices... no. I know I've had a better seasoned, and more moist rotisserie chicken from a grocery store. Yes, I said it.   I did have the chance to steal bites of the trout from Jenn W and Matthew K. How I regret ordering the chicken!! The trout was moist and meaty and full of so much flavor it was silly!! I also had a few bites of Amanda B's short rib dish. The sauce on the short rib was tasty and smoky; the short rib itself was almost too fatty. I know short ribs are supposed to have some fat content, but this was like eating blubber in some bites, not appetizing. I had high hopes for my dessert.  Our dinner dishes were finally cleared away and we were left to chat for a bit before our dessert order was taken. I had the molten chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Meh... the brownie wasn't exactly as molten as I expected and considering my ice cream was largely melted I was hoping the whole brownie was warm, nope. The melted ice cream was possibly our \"speedy\" waiter's handiwork.  Our waiter was kind enough to allow split bills and there was no problem in mixed up tabs or anything which was great.   I think I will go back to the Roaring Fork for a happy hour or to try some of their more creative dishes. Maybe a basic chicken dish threw them for a loop; I hope they can wow me next time with something different!",

    "text": "I joined several yelperz for the UYE Restuant Week excursion. It was SO much fun sitting there and laughing around with everyone joking about God-knows-what. If it weren't for the company - this would have been a TERRIBLE night!!   The food was good... my green chile pork stew was good and I enjoyed it. However, it made my \"date\" sick. Poor thing! But my braised beef ribs were a HUGE chunk of meat! lol! and it was so fatty! A good 25% of it was fat. gross. But the beef was falling off the bone and very good. My creme brulee` was just... creme brulee`. Nothing great, outstanding... or amazing. Heck Carraba's creme brulee` is better! HA!   The service was ATROCIOUS! I never had such slow service! The waiter was friendly and a lil bit of a smartass (which was actually really refreshing) and really nice but MAN he was WAY off his game. We waited over 30 minutes between courses and every single course someone was left out. There was one less soup, one less entree, one less dessert. Every time someone would have to wait for their food. I felt bad each time and really it was uncalled for. I wanted to just go off on the manager who I saw spend over 20 minutes sucking up to a different table and wanted to only spend 2 minutes with us. But alas, I didn't want to scare my fellow yelpers and chose not to say anything. double grrrrr...   By then of the night - I spent over $120 on a meal for two (the MOST I have ever spent on one single dinner! Ugh, is this what it feels like to be a man??) and got know some more of my fellow yelpers. Which of course, makes it worth it.   Straight up - I'll never go back. It's waay too far, it's WAAY too expensive and the service is WAAAAAYWAAAAY too shity and is NOT worth the gas, money and time to go there. If I have to pay over $60 a head, the service better be fucking great!! Cuz straight up, the food wasn't THAT good to where I'd look over all their flaws and go anyway. Methinks not!",

At first we were offered the chefs tables by the kitchen and I thought it was too small and noisy, they were nice to accomodate us elsewhere.  The food is really yummy and the service is exceptional without being annoying.  Dear BF had the roasted pork, which at first we were told they were out but then found some left for him, yay or I would have never heard the end of it.  I also had a taste for pork that nite but I asked for the pork tenderloin with potatoes instead of grits, very nice, we also shared a Waldorf salad which could I have used a bit more dressing and their guacamole and queso.  Loved the melted cheese, would have made the perfect nachos.  Next time I think I will try the trout.",

Also 5 star worthy is the mexican street corn, rainbow trout, steaks and chicken tortilla soup....

Everything was just superb( and i never use this word) the trout comes topped with brown butter and almonds and it was just a party in my mouth. hands down probably the best fish i have ever had! the ribs were good as well and the short rib was very tender and melted in your mouth.   unfortunately no room for desert because our gluttony got the best of us but we saw the desserts other people had and they looked fattening and tasty.  all of this accompanied by shots of tequila and martinis and taken care of by the sweetest attentive server!  Roaring Fork you are my new love, I'm so glad we met last night, you totally rock my world!  p.s thurs-sun they have a great deal . pick and entree and three sides all for $18. you are welcome :)",

    "text": "The food was very good, the place is pretty cool, and the wait staff is on-point. So why the two stars? I made a reservation via open table, which the restaurant's website practically requires you to do (not the best website, btw). I made the reservation well in advance. This place was so highly recommended to me that we drove nearly an hour just to experience it. We get there, check in with the hostess, she says she doesn't have our reservation. I politely assure her that we have one, and she immediately starts acting like I'm making this up. Instead of apologizing, she starts with the spiel about wait times until I pull out my phone and show her the confirmation email. Still not believing me, she grabs the phone and scrutinizes the confirmation email like she's certain that I'm wrong. After realizing that they are in fact at fault, we get a reluctant apology are asked to have a seat in the lobby.   20 minutes after our reservation time we were finally seated. While we were waiting we watched two couples that came in after us get seated immediately and a couple of other people were invited to wait in what turned out to be their bar area for happy hour while we waited. Apparently we didn't rate the same such invitation. As we were FINALLY being seated I politely told the hostess that I didn't appreciate not being given the option to wait in the bar area (again, we've never been there and you can't really see it from the lobby) or the assumption that the reservation mix-up was our fault. I receive a blank stare and an emotionless apology in return. And apparently it wasn't a priority to let anyone in management know that there was a reservation snafu, a couple of unhappy patrons, or further, for management to be proactive and check in with guests at some point like most other places of this caliber.  Again, the food was good but the hostess soured what would have been a great experience otherwise. Considering the location I had feared getting a typical Snottsdale kind of experience, and that's pretty much exactly what we got. We probably won't come back.",

    "text": "My wife and I  and our best friends are visiting from California and someone recommended that we eat at Roaring Fork. First or all, the ambiance and atmosphere was really nice. We started with two appetizers,  the chorizo and muscles and the chili pork with queso.  Both were really good but the chili pork queso was my favorite! I give a lot of merit to that decision to the homemade tortillas. We also had the tortilla soup and although the presentation was creative and something I've never experienced before, the soup was good, not great, but good. My wife and and sister had the date salad and both said the salad was good but they've had better. My buddy and I had the rib eye which was on top of a bed of potatoes and topped with delicious asparagus!! My steak was cooked medium rare just like I ordered. The steak was a great cut and tasted a little salty but it was an amazing piece of steak!   The creme brulee, for dessert, was really good. Not the best I've ever had but really good!  The reason I'm giving this place a four star instead of five is because the service was not up to par and the overall presentation was just not worth a five star rating.   I might come back to Roaring Fork if the right occasion occurs but for the price of our meal and the service we received, it wouldn't be our first choice.",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. It was amazing!!   When we first walked in it was a little bit awkward. They don't start serving until 4 PM, which is usually their happy hour time. I wasn't aware of that's when we walked up to the hostess she said to wait for the cow bell to ring and from there it was open seating throughout the restaurant for happy hour. We had gotten there a couple minutes before four, so we were waiting along with a bunch of other people in the lobby awkwardly.  However when the cow bell rang, we made our way all the way to the back towards the patio. Being it Arizona and that it's really hot outside, this place has such an amazing cool temperature patio. Not once did I feel hot or sticky. The fans were blowing, they have misters going, and they had plenty of shade.    We basically had the whole patio to ourselves till about an hour into our meal, which was awesome! Their happy hour is quite spectacular, I can now see why there is a line out the door waiting to get in. All their drinks and all their appetizers are at reasonable prices.   Besides the price being great, the service and the food was spot on! You are paying for quality and excellent service. Tonya was our server and she was amazing, she was very kind and patient and gave us recommendations on what to order. For starters we had the pork wings and nachos, we also had two mojitos.  These were off the happy hour menu, and they did not cheap out on portion sizes, and you can really taste the alcohol in your drinks which was nice. For our meal my boyfriend had the duck and I had the  fillet mignon steak. We ordered two sides one was their green chili mac & cheese and sauteed spinach with onions. Everything was cooked to perfection! Both dishes had their meats nice and tender, not dry at all. The steak had a nice char on it and it was a very well seasoned. The green chili mac & cheese is on early out of this world! I would seriously just go back for this dish by itself! The spinach and onions were very good also, the spinach wasn't too soggy and was perfectly wilted. We we both ordered margaritas, I got the prickly pear and my boyfriend got the original margarita. I love how the margaritas don't paste super sweet and you can taste the alcohol that you are paying for this drink!!! They're very generous with their portions!   Tonya our server, was so great! She was so attentive to our table even when she started getting busy and had more than six tables to serve. I mentioned to her that it was my boyfriend's birthday and she came out with a complimentary dessert for us to split!  I would highly recommend this place to anyone! I have been to Mastro steakhouse, that's right by them, and they just cannot compete with the Roaring Fork. Their food, their service, and their ambience trumps that place any day! So if you're looking for amazing cuisine that's not too expensive this is your place!",

In fact the entire wait staff was amazing, constantly ensuring we had water and the wine in the glass never got too low.  We both got steaks - KC strip and filet - and they were perfectly cooked and had just the right amount of seasoning. My boyfriends meal came with salad, broccolini and potatoes, which were all very good. I went al a carte and got the green chili Mac as my side - I would have been so happy to get just that and nothing else! It was so good! A must must try.   We ended with the creme brulee and the blood orange sorbet and it was just as good as everything else we had. All in all a wonderful experience and delicious meal.",

It was so huge! The waiter didn't really know how to pair a wine or recommend another wine because they do not serve moscato. He forgot to give us utensils, enough appetizer plates for our party, and didn't give a water to the little 3 year old at our table. When we asked for a water, he brought back a glass water for a 3 year old. Really? No kid friendly cup? The food is amazing though! I would definitely go back for the food. And hopefully, the waiter gets some more experience by the time we go back.",

It was bland and tasteless.  The green chili macaroni and cheese was overcooked and mushy. This must've been a not so good night in the kitchen. Maybe the winter chef goes north once Summer comes? My advice is to skip this restaurant until fall and see if the food quality improves. I was sorely disappointed tonight.",

The we orders the Big Ass burger, and it came back as exactly that .. a Big Ass burger. However, we asked for it to be cooked well, guess it goes against the grain of the Chef because after we cut it in half and it was red and bloody. Not even close to being well cooked.   I told the waiter and he offered to take it back to throw back on the grill, but we decided against it , because of the huge pile of ingredients on the burger . Did not want to disassemble the burger it would have been nice to have them just cook us another one.   The service wasn't great after that.. guess you can't complain..   Anyways all, give it a try you may have better luck , but for us , we won't be back!",

The service is always awesome and the food, simply deelish. The Queso Puerco and the Green Chili Pork are yummy and at happy hour prices, $8 and $7 respectively, hard to beat. There are a few negatives though. First, the parking. It can be a drag. Second, the bathrooms. Always seems strange to have to walk into the main office complex down a long hall to get to the bathrooms. How in the world was this place ever permitted without bathrooms within the restaurant space? Lastly, the drinks can be very different depending on the bartender that makes them. But our servers have always been awesome.",

We went on a Tuesday night at 7:15, and it was a good thing we had made reservations via Open Table, because it was busy.  It completely lived up to every bit of the rave reviews.  The restaurant is in an odd location on the ground floor of an office building relatively close to the Fashion Square Mall.  Inside, the space is warm, cozy and comfortable.  The service was attentive and the prices were really, seriously reasonable for the quality of the food and the portion size.  We shared one of the salads and enjoyed the complimentary basket of miniature cornbread muffins and bread rolls.  I had the special of the evening, cioppino (a fantastic fish stew), and it was incredible.  My husband loved his double cut glazed pork chop.  The entrees come with a small amount of garnish but there is a list of separate sides you can get.  Be aware that if you can't make up your mind, they can do half portions of multiple sides for a very reasonable price!!!!  The green chile mac and cheese lived up to the hype and the Mexican street corn side was also great.  Enjoyed huckleberry cheesecake and pecan pie with ice cream for dessert.  One of the best meals I have had in this city, and would not hesitate to go back or to recommend to our local friends (which I have already done)!!!",

It was a wonderful selection and a huge serving. The food was yummy. All three of us got the trout and were all pleased with it. It was a huge portion. The shrimp cocktail was also a large portion.   The bar here was much busier than the dining room because they are known for a great happy hour. The decor of the dining room was a little stuffy. That would be my main complaint.   Our server was wonderful. Very attentive and helpful. We were not there for a special ocassion but we did walk past a table with a sign that said \"Happy Anniversary\" from Roaring Fork with a red long stem rose. I thought it was a nice touch and worth mentioning.   I will have to ckeck out the happy hour next time. Otherwise, unless it is a set menu like tonight, I don't think I would eat in the main dining room again.",

I was a little nervous since sometimes when people stress about how great a place is then it never lives up to your expectations. Definitely wrong about that! We sat at the bar and I wish I could remember the bar tender's name that served us because he was amazing! We had amazing wine and food and I cannot wait to come back for happy hour!",

    "text": "I'd really give it a 3.5.  lol  Came here on a FRI, EARLY, and the place was bustling!  More proof that no one in Scottsdale cooks for themselves.  ;)  The service was a 4 for sure.  Attentive, without being overbearing.  At our table, we had the mixed green salad, the duck breast, the mixed grill, and the big ass burger.  The mixed salad was fresh - nothing amazing or different.  It was pretty typical of a balsamic salad.  The big ass burger is well named.  The thing was disgustingly huge, and unless you have a big ass appetite, you won't finish it.  It also has a spicy chili on it, so if that's not your thing, whip it off, or your tongue will be burning.  The mixed grill was well done, but again, many of the items were spiced - the shrimp and sausage both had a kick.  The real disappoint came on the duck breast.  :(  I had ordered it medium, thinking it would still come medium rare, and it came rare.  NOT happy.  But, I was starving, they were busy, and I didnt want to lag behind everyone else by sending it back.  It was sliced into pieces, so there was no excuse to not cook it to temperature as ordered.  Came with a nice onion relish (spicy - lol), and braised cabbage.  Deserts were huge.  We had the lava brownie and the pecan pie.  Both served a la gelato.  Overall, there wasn't anything we ate that made anyone say, \"oooo!  you MUST try this!\".  The food (besides the duck problem) was prepared well, nice presentation, but there was nothing that was overwhelming.  The atmosphere is nice, the service was really great, but there wasn't anything on the menu you won't find anywhere else, nor was it prepared nor presented any better.  I would consider it like a Kona Grill.  It's good for what it is, but nothing spectacular.",

The service was where our family was greatly disappointed. We waited far too long to receive the next course (15+ minutes) and our waiter was no where to be found, never checking to see how we liked our dinner. My water glass set empty during half the meal until I snagged a busboy to fill it for me. I saw our waiter only once during the meal when he did a \"flyby\" through his serving area, not making eye contact with any of his tables. We waited and waited to order an after dinner beverage and when it was finally brought to the table, our waiter tried to leave both glasses with the closest person rather than distribute them accordingly. Our waiter shall go nameless here as I do not wish to humiliate openly on the web, but something was not quite right with this guy! Not just his absence, but his actions, speech, facial expressions and demeanor. I think that this establishment needs to reevaluate its hiring/training standards.",

The place was relaxing and accommodating (we had a disabled companion with us).  Our server was Shay and she was as good a waitress as I have ever had. Just the right combination of personable, helpful, efficient and not over-fawning. I would go back just to be in her section. Ask for her - you will not be disappointed! The food was fabulous. I had the Green Chile Pork Stew (on Shay's recommendation) and I now crave it. Hubby had the Big Ass burger which was just that. And while it was excellent, it could not be called a signature dish like mine. The tortilla soup was very good and surprising.  We enjoyed the salads as well. We all had the Guava Mojito which was quite good. Our dining companions raved about the Huckleberry Margaritas which they had on a previous visit so we are looking forward to trying them next time. I would like to try another dish but I suspect I will not be able to resist the pork stew. I highly recommend this restaurant and it is now at the top of our list of relaxed, delicious, reasonably priced happy hour spots in Scottsdale. We WILL be back!",

    "text": "I do not get it Yelp! I was so mislead by this place. I took the BF here for his *official* birthday dinner and it was a massive disappointment. The menu looks really good and the restaurant looks ok... kind of big and Houston's -ish. We were sat at one of the 'chef's tables' a table right next to the kitchen. That was kind of cool.. lots of yelling. Our server was really not good, he was extremely slow and inattentive. It took him a long time to come around, and when he did he only wanted to take drink orders. We wanted to drink water, and he didn't seem too happy with that. He walked off. Anyway, we finally ordered and I got the fried chicken and the BF got the short ribs (which he was really excited for) and we got the green chili mac and cheese due to the good reviews of it. Then we waited for a very long time. When the food came out, mine had a sauce on it that was congealed and looked really gross. The chicken itself was nothing special.... they used a really thick cut boneless breast and it was really dry. The mashed potatoes that came with it tasted like nothing.... totally flavorless. ugh. The BF's short ribs were also very meh. They were bone in (really? they couldn't take the bone out for 25$ hmmm). They also didn't render all of the fat so they had massive amounts of fat on them. Yuck. In addition, they had very little flavor... you would think something braised in Dr. Pepper would be delicious... not the case. Again, it was totally bland. Furthermore, the mac and cheese was really not good either. The first bite tasted ok, but as it went on, it tasted like kraft singles with chile peppers. yum? not so much. So we wanted to get cake, it being the BF's birthday and all.... but nothing on the dessert menu looked very good and honestly we were scared to get a dessert after the food being so lackluster. I will never go back here.",

    "text": "Roaring Fork offers a more rustic feel for the bold American cuisine.  The dim lights created a warm and inviting atmosphere to the cool evening.  But there was still enough light to view the food that I was served.  I opted for Frying Pan River Rainbow Trout.  The trout is sauteed with roasted almonds, capers and brown butter creating a delectable combination for the palate.   The fish was flakey that melted in my mouth.  The slight crust on top created a wonderful contrast to the soft fish.  A squeeze of lemon actually added to the flavor as well to the saltiness of the fish.  The taste was light yet strong as the same time.  The almonds added to the crunchy taste like the crust on top of the fish.  Along with the fish was a piece of cornbread made with real corn.  I could taste the corn chucks in the bread.  It had a slight sweet taste to contrast the fish's flavors.  But it didn't overpower the fish.  The whole dish had so many textures and flavors that made me jump with delight.  My tummy was happy.   Of all the great things I have to say about the dish, I would still say that it lacked \"specialness\" to it that would make the dish and the restaurant shine and stand out from the others.",

Twenty minutes went by and they still had not taken even a drink order (though a busser had brought bread). My date had to go inside and ask for service. When my parents arrived they suddenly found my reservation, and the receptionist told them I had not arrived yet (which I had)! As a result, they had to search all over the restaurant to find us. They finally took our drink order and a bit later actually delivered us menus! The food was adequate and overpriced for the quality. Would not go back.",

We actually enjoyed sitting next to the kitchen, usually sitting next to a kitchen turns me off, although we were drooling over all of the delicious looking food coming out the kitchen. It helped us decide what we wanted to eat!!  THEN because I loved Roaring Fork so much, my boyfriend and I decided to come in for happy hour about a week later and had the grilled fish tacos with some wine and their Huckleberry Frozen Margarita! MMM! Usually I'm not a fan of frozen margs, although this frozen marg was AMAZING! Still drooling over it.   Definitely come in for a great time for a dinner or even just for happy hour! You won't be let down!",

Big ass burger huge and fabulous.  They cook rate if you want. Go for happy hour prices much better and portions still big enough.

I had Duck Breast cooked perfect with a cabbage side that was amazing. Serious I would kill donald if it meant I could be served this duck breast again.   Dessert: I had pecan pie with ice cream. Both were made in house and my God kiss that cook. My grandma would weep for the deliciousness of this Pecan pie.   Drinks: I had a 5$ jim beam old fashioned that was pretty good with a glass of Bone breaker Zin from Lodi region. I found a new wine man was it good. I actually Google it to send a case home. I love me some lodi wines   Service: I had Chris the bartender and he was fantastic. Ask for him. An old soul who is nice and delivers perfect service",

I only finished it because I don't stop eating until a hate myself. next time I have to see if they can add a fried egg & avo to seal the deal as the best burger in Phoenix.

    "text": "I was in town for work and had a really good experience at Roaring Fork. The atmosphere is definitely a steak house vibe with a lot of wood and low-lighting, which is a vibe I really love. I was seated in a booth for two right by the kitchen (which would have been distracting had I not been alone, but since I was alone, made for great entertainment while I was eating).  My waitress, April, was lovely. They start with a basket of bread that has french bread and little muffins that I believed were jalapeno corn muffins and a side of whipped butter. The bread was hot and delicious. I also ordered a glass of cab, which April advised was the driest and it was perfect.  For my main, I was between two dishes and April helped me decide by letting me know they do individual portions of the sides and that I could get the horseradish mashed potatoes that normally come with the short ribs with the filet I wanted to order. I ordered the filet medium rare and it came out rare (which for me is a very pleasant surprise because I prefer it rare but never order it that way since most restaurants cannot seem to get it right). The steak was very good, could have used a little more seasoning, but was cooked perfectly and was very tender. The horseradish mashed potatoes were SPICY. I liked them, but could only eat so much before my throat started to burn.   Finally, the star of the show: the pecan pie. Wow. I am not normally a fan of pecan pie but a lot of reviews mentioned it so I figured I would give it a try. It was awesome. They serve it warm and covered in chocolate chips. It comes with ice cream too but I was too full to eat that without sacrificing a bite of the pecan pie. If you go here, order this no matter what. Simply fabulous.",

We got to the restaurant a little after 5 on a Friday and there was no place in the bar area, the extended bar area (by the front door-which was new since we last visited) or the outside patio that is part of the door so we were seated in the patio area where you can't get the happy hour menu. We would have loved to enjoy the happy hour menu but that wasn't going to happen.   With that said, we had great service and a very good meal. We both ordered cocktails and they were well made and fairly priced. We also both ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin over grits served with Mexican street corn and a balsamic glaze. I subbed the green chile mac and cheese for the grits which required an upcharge of $2.50. I gladly agreed to the upcharge because the green chile mac and cheese is one of my favorites here. It is served in a small cast iron skillet with toasted bread crumbs on top. It is not spicy and is well flavored. We each ate about half our meal which was a large portion and a shame because we were headed to the airport so couldn't take it with us. When you arrive, you get a bread basket with freshly baked rolls and mini corn muffins. I have been here many times before and never had a bad meal.   Again, the happy hour is awesome but get there early----it fills up.",

    "text": "I had high expectations of this place based on reviews. I have to say the food was very disappointing.  We had a party of 6 and didn't have reservations so instead of wait we sat in the \"bar/side area.\"   The service there was spectacular! I'd give 10 stars for service. Our waitress was beyond amazing, attentive, friendly, and helpful.  This was during restaurant week but we didn't realize it. The waitress suggested that menu as it would only be available for a few more days. We started with various appetizers and also each had the chicken soup. The soup looked incredible but was very bland and disappointing.  The short ribs again looked fabulous but were full of non rendered fat. The sea bass was okay, but not much flavor. I really expected a lot more from the food. The cocktails were good, so that helped.  All in all this was decent, but not really worth the cost.",

The happy hour huckleberry frozen margarita was the best.   I am thinking it has chambord in it but maybe not.    They still have the big ass burger with fries.   I see the HH price has been adjusted to $10.   Last  I was there it was $6.   Still a good deal.  I had the rotisserie chicken flatbread pizza.   Since I am not a fan of bread, I had tasted it, and the crust is like a cracker, which is perfect.   The topping is what makes it, of course.   It wasn't soggy; the chicken was flavored and cooked perfectly, and it had a good mix of whatever cheeses and herbs and spices.   The price was right as well, only $8.  Yepp.   I'm definitely returning.",

    "text": "What started off as a great 19th anniversary dinner, quickly snowballed into the wife and I questioning what the heck are we doing here?  Was seated in the (almost) back corner of the dining room and when the bus boy went to reset the tables and chairs back to normal (after a large party just left), he closed a floor-to-ceiling curtain that rested against my chair...um no, I was not sitting here. When I told the staff that I didn't like having a huge curtain wall brushing up against me causing claustrophobia while I ate, they couldn't understand why I wanted it open (see pix) and opened it back up amid some protest. Note, this all transpired while the wife was in the bathroom. As my wife got back to the table, she said she overheard the staff complaining in another language (a language my wife is fluent in) about some guy's gripe about the curtain being closed...that guy being me.  As for the food, the complimentary bread was better than most free bread at sit-down restaurants...two types were in the basket, one of which was a slightly spicy jalapeno bread. The guacamole and tortilla chips appetizer we ordered was a nice compliment to the jalapeno bread.  For the main course, I opted for the \"special,\" which is a printed insert located in inside the menu. For $55 bucks, I got to choose a 3-course meal: an appetizer, main course and desert. For the appetizer, I selected the tortilla soup, which had a dark and rich broth with the rest of the components (chicken, avocado, cheese, cilantro and tortilla strips) scooped into the center of the bowl. And while the broth was perfect, the appetizer would have tasted  much better had all the components had been cooked together to allow all those wonderful flavors to mix together. While the presentation was a perfect 10 (see pix), all of the components lacked a cohesiveness which could have made the soup a perfect 10 as well!  I ordered the 16oz Delmonico Rib eye steak and was disappointed from the first bite. According to the waitress, all the steaks are cut in-house, including mine. Whoever cut my steak must've been their first day on the job because my steak seriously looked like and had the texture of London broil (see pix). There was no marbling whatsoever, only a small strip of fat on the end. To compound a felony, the steak knife I received, was dull and literally could not cut the steak. I kid you not, my butter knife had a more serrated edge and did a better job of cutting thru the meat.  Long story short, the waitress allowed me to switch things up and recommended I try the \"Big @$$\" burger, which was one of the better burgers I've had. And while the waitress allowed me to go from a $55 plate to a $15 plate, they still charged me $9 for the first course tortilla soup which (while fair) was a bit of a cheap shot and did nothing to rectify the situation. On a side note, I guess I can't complain too much as we did score a free desert because it was our anniversary.  One other minor complaints is that for as upscale and romantic as other Yelper's say this place is, there is a lot of alcohol flowing and some of the patrons were a bit obnoxious (drunk) and kind of killed the romantic flair of this joint.  Will definitely go back and give this place another shot, but will be sure to first do our research before placing an order.",

Any steak will be 2 levels less cooked than what you ask for. My sirloin strip salad (ordered medium) was literally bleeding on the lettuce. I'm not kidding. The real problem here, though, is the service. It's horrendous. The wait staff will refill water ONLY if you ask for it and then only half the glasses on the table. Remember my salad? We had six people who were waving and shouting at literally ALL the wait staff and couldn't get anyone to come to our table. It's very loud and they are all oblivious. By the time we got someone to ask about cooking the steak more, our whole table was finished eating. That tells you, through an entire meal, nobody came to check on the food or drinks, or anything.  They did eventually bring a new salad (steak still undercooked) and the horseradish salad dressing is great. But we will never go back.",

Salad comes out with whole sardines on the top !!  Like wow.  That was replaced.  Then came dinner.  My steak was over cooked (medium instead of medium rare) the meat quality just wasn't very high.   What you expect for a 40.00 filet is much more than what I got.  and the tenderloin salad was just plain tough, over cooked bits of meat in a salad.  Flavor wasn't even good.

John was engaging, extremely helpful and has a great sense of humor. John was such a great server we cancelled our table in the dining area. Why move when our experience was already fabulous???  Needless to say between the outstanding service coupled with the quality of our meals which were all fantastic (short ribs, pork verde, mussels to name the mains) we have to give 5 stars!!!!  Thanks John for taking great care of us in one of Scottsdale's finest and most consistent restaurants.",

The service was prompt and friendly.  We decided on just getting the specials for the evening after some contemplation. My father got the 8 oz Filet Mignon and I ended up getting the seafood special with lobster sauce. I enjoyed the assortment of seafood and some bread to dip into the lobster sauce. I tried a little bit of the steak as well which was excellent, although I usually don't have steak on the norm.  While the experience was wonderful we thought it was a bit too pricey for what was being offered. Even still I would recommend Roaring Fork and may come back to try out their happy hour menu sometime.",

My wife enjoyed the trout and said it was a great combination of textures and flavors. As a final not I would highly recommend the signature huckleberry marguerita.

The size of the appetizers is significant so they can easily substitute for a dinner entree.  I usually order the Big Ass Burger for $10 (the name is pretty accurate). My son and husband usually get the Kettle of Green Chile Pork and the Pork Wings respectively, often times paired with a salad. Happy Hour begins at 4pm and there is often a line waiting to get in, well worth the wait!    If we forgo the Happy Hour menu, which is rare, I usually order the Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin with White Falls Mill Cheese Grits and Mexican Street Corn and my husband gets the Rib Eye, both are delicious!  Definitely make reservations if going for dinner, it can get crowded.",

I've been craving it ever since! Those are definite must haves if you have never been. Did I mention the prices are extremely reasonable? Walking in, I thought this place was going to be really expensive but I was really surprised to see that the prices are very reasonable! Definitely a must try place and perfect place to go for date night. Also something to note is that they have happy hour every weeknight until 10pm (I might be wrong on that time but it ends late!) during the summer. You're welcome ;)",

The Big Ass Burger was so big that I finished maybe 1/2 of it? I ordered it medium rare and it looked like it was still half alive... Maybe I'll order medium next time...  The Seared Ahi Tuna was good, although somewhat bland.  The green chili was good. The warm soft tortillas were a nice touch and the chili had a slight kick to it.  Service was top notch from a uniformed waiter.  Make sure to check out the loo, it's just like the one at the office! ;)",

True the duck breast with the chili Mac and cheese and shaved Brussel sprouts along with onion jam. Yummy. We also tried the Delmonico steak with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Wow. Have leftovers of all of this for tomorrow. Darr was really good. I recommend the crime brulee. The pecan pie was tasty with the ice cream and whipped cream but I like my pie better. Everyone worked as a team and service was great. Good place for a date or family.",

Here's What I got   Kettle of pork Carmita's with melted jack cheese and bettered flour tortillas   7.00!! = This pork literally melts in your mouth this was the most tender meat I have ever had. I wouldn't have though to order pork I'm soo glad I did. I was also surprised I wouldn't have thought of this place as having mexicanish food?  The tortillas were sooo thin and soft and buttery. Very good dish, perfect for 2.  Fish tacos 9.00 = This was very good, I have never in my life ever ever ever ordered fish tacos, since I hate fish. It was grouper   and  it came with very fresh avocado and thin sliced red onion and a very good salsa. The salsa was like blended, so it wasn't the typical tomato chunks salsa.   They also have a 7.00 \"big ass burger\" Yes, that's really what they call it.  I saw everyone order it and every time they brought one out I got jealous.  It was about the width off two burgers and came with a side of fries that looked soo good. They too were served in a kettle and were very thin but not the crispy gross thin ones.   We came in before they opened at like 2 and we were told that happy hour is when they open at 4pm.   This guy came in at that time and was telling us how he couldn't wait until 4 because they have the best burger ever.   So I'm excited to try more off the menu and especially try the burger",

Also, they have bleu cheese stuffed olives which top off an already perfect dirty martini. I'm in heaven in this place and go back often.

    "text": "\"An American Bistro and Bar,\" this western but elegant establishment serves up cowboy fare wtih a twist of new mexico and a dash of french savvy for sauces.  The decor is typical for the wild west...chandeliers made from the antlers of deer, wood finishes, and a saloon to quench the thirst.  They do have an extensive wine list, though I tried one of their mixed drinks, which is something I do at every restaurant I visit.  'Iced Tea' - Bacardi Limon, Lemon & Mint  'Wrath of McGrath' - A Shiner Bock Beer with a Shot of 100 Proof Smirnoff Jalapeno Vodka drizzled over it & a Squeeze of Lime  For an appetizer I tried the Cockles and Craw Fish, with a roasted garlic butter sauce with kaffir lime.  I would have spent more than the $9.50 just to delight in the sauce again.  Truly a phenomenal and unique taste, though there was only a small amount of crawfish, and perhaps five cockles. Well, it is an appetizer, though i can guarantee that once you sample this savory sauce, you will want more.  Second Appetizer was the Kettle of green chile pork, with jack cheese and flour tortillas.  Also $9.50, and very delicious, this appetizer is not so overwhelming as to satisfy appetite, but is intense on the taste buds, as it is flavored with a habanero pepper.  The Restraurant offers two seperate menus.  TheSaloon menu is available at the bar only, and features less expensive foods from 8.50-12.00.  Stew, Steak, Quesadillas, and a \"Big Ass Burger\" are all found here.  I shared a \"Big Ass Burger\" with my beau, for $10.00, and we couldn't fit it into our mouth.   Though our waitress was slow, and we waited quite some time for our drinks, she was very amiable.  When I bit into a wedge of plastic while enjoying the appetizer, the manager came to personally apologize and to offer us complimentary dessert, as well as taking the Crawfish off the bill.  Though none of that was necessary, it is always a treat when a restaurant concerns itself in such a way with pleasing its customers.  As for the Restaurant menu, here is the complete menu and photos, taken from the roaring fork website:  Boneless Buttermilk-Fried CHICKEN with Pan Gravy & Mashed Potatoes AHI Seared with Smoked Salt, Chamomile Steamed Vegetables, Chipotle Vinaigrette PORK Rib Chop, Red Chile Sauce, Baked Squash with Apples SALMON Campfire-Style Ginger Vinaigrette, Soy Beans, Tomato DUCK Breast, Onion Jam, Sour Cherry Mustard, Little Cabbages HALIBUT Dusted with Dried Tomato...Soft Herbs, Sugar Snaps, Meyer Lemon Sauce LAMB Rib Loin, Corn Fritter, Green Beans with Toasted Hazelnuts Vanilla Lamb Glace & Green Jelly Almond-Crusted TROUT, VEAL Bacon, Asparagus & Horseradish Potatoes Tarragon Sauce BEEF Short Rib Braised in Dr. Pepper Barbecue Sauce, Chile Cheese Grits Grilled SHRIMP with Green Rice with HAM BEEF Tenderloin, Whiskey a Shellaca, Green Chile Macaroni",

My friend's burger was huge, no surprise given it's very direct menu name- he loved it. Our server was very personable and extremely professional.

The couple of things that are negatives are the nasty attitude of the people at the front desk.  They also insist on reservations.  There are so many empty booths and tables and yet they will turn you away at 9 pm on a Friday if you don't have a reservation.

    "text": "I was really disappointed this evening. We stopped in last night and had such marvelous service that I booked for the following night for a group of 6. They were so kind to accommodate us. We went back tonight...the food was wonderful but the service did not merit the price of the restaurant. Our waiter, Darrell, virtually ignored us...long spaces between courses, no explanations. 4 of the 6 had the fixed price and had given their dessert order. He left the remaining 2 with a menu but never came back to follow up. We finally asked the bus boy/man.  I had also booked the reservation telling them we were celebrating a birthday and a graduation...of which no mention was made.  I was embarrassed that some of our guests were disappointed, and disappointed that my grandson's graduation was not acknowledged when they told me they would be sure to mark it down. Although the food and atmosphere were great, there are other places who respect our desire for value for money spent.",

We were seated outside and the misters were on, I was sitting closer to the door inside and the misters were perfect for keeping it cool enough, but others on the outer skirts of the patio (closer to the actual misters) were sopping wet.  I guess it's better than sweating?  The dinner entree was a menu choice of 3 proteins: chicken fried steak, steamed fish or an 8oz. filet-- I had the filet, it was excellent and cooked perfectly to order (medium).  We had shrimp cocktail to start and that was sooo good!  Giant succulent shrimp with an amazing, salsa-ish cocktail sauce.  Really, it was just wonderful.  Ended the meal with a creme brulee that knocked my socks off, errr heels since I wasn't wearing socks to begin with.   Service was friendly, fast and helpful.  Roaring Fork was an excellent choice for this dinner party.    Oh, I can't forget to mention the cornbread-like biscuits in the bread basket, those were delicious.",

My fellow diners were also satisfied with their orders. The one dish I didn't think was very good was the green chili mac and cheese side. It tasted like velveeta instant mac & cheese with a little green chili added.  If I was only rating the food, this place would probably get 3 stars but I had some issues with the service and ambience.  Our party was seated towards the back of the restaurant near a back door, which servers used to go in and out to get more chairs. This happened at least 3 times during our meal, which was an issue since the temp was down to about 50 degrees that night. The service was also not great, for example, we asked for more bread and it was never brought out.   All in all, decent food but nothing special.",

We had the back room all to ourselves which was really nice, and we had tons of appetizers as we mingled and chatted with drinks in hand. What the appetizers were, I do not remember, but I do remember that it was alot of food.   Next we were seated for dinner and mind you I was a little stuffed from the appetizers but alas I took one for the team and made sure to partake in dinner. We had a caesar salad to start, I ordered the filet mignon and of course the chocolate brownie for dessert. We also had a huge bowl of the mac and cheese to share at the table and I tell you that was some good mac and cheese. Cheesy and spicy! What more can a girl ask for.  Will have to go and visit that place again soon.",

It's rich and delicious, and it happens to have the best burger in town. The bar features lots of delish micro-brews, and the service doesn't disappoint in this section, either.

One problem as out of towners that we experienced was the location of the place. The address says that it is on N Scottsdale Road while it is really on Chapparal. It is very difficult to see from Scottsdale Road. There is room for improvement to make it easier for people who are not familiar with the exact location.",

But you could barely see a thin layer on the salmon and it didn't even taste like bbq sauce.  It had this nice hint of sweetness that did not overwhelm the wonderful taste of the salmon.  Pure perfection!  They were nice enough to trade out the greenbeans that come with it, with asparagus.  Asparagus was pretty good with this salty/garlic sauce on it.  One thing I was really disappointed with was the service!  O M G talk about waiting an hour for a check!!   And she was a bit snippy on her responses.  Did not like that one bit!

That would be my only complaint (but they can't help that customers are rude).  Our service was excellent, drinks are well priced at $5.

Keep an eye on their updates because a little birdie told me that the all night happy hour is coming to town very soon!",

The food was good my chicken was a little salty but still very tasty. We tried their signature side (chili macaroni) which was very tasty and their margarita drinks was tasty and strong. When I am in the area again I will def make a visit.",

The bread basket selection was sadly the best part of the meal. We won't be going back to this overrated and dated spot.",

The bar and patio were open seating and there were 4 or 5 groups ahead of us. Luckily a reservation canceled and we were able to get seated. Even with over an hour wait it was worth it. We all had specials which included a salad, entree and dessert. I had a steak that was cooked perfectly and so tender. My husband and nephew had ahi tuna and said it was delicious. It was seasoned well and the rice that went with it was very good. Desserts were creme brulee and pecan pie. Both were very good.   It was a bit difficult to find but so worth it",

    "text": "Happy hour here for us really were happy hourS!  On a Sunday and Monday, happy hour hours are from 4 to 10 PM!  And on all other days, 4 to 7 PM.  This place is gigantic!  A patio is even provided and perfect for November days.  Heat lamps are also available.  Everything we devoured was on point!  All we ordered were appetizers off the happy hour menu.  The pork wings ($8 - 3 big meaty pieces) were amazing and came with a unique Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce!  I love Dr. Pepper!  And I loved how it came with the sauce on the side so you can dip the generous amount of pork wing into the sauce.  I also liked the touch of hominy, pickled veggies, and Cotija cheese sprinkled over the wings.  A+ on the overall balance of this appetizer.  We liked it so much that we ordered another one before finishing up the first one.    We also ordered the Kettle of Green Chili Pork ($8) - this one I also loved!  It really came in a cute little kettle filled with the goods!  Then it also came with hot buttered flour tortillas in foil to keep it warm.  This one just melted in my mouth.  I think this one was probably my favorite out of the three appetizers.  The pork was moist and very flavorful and savory.    And since we were still hungry, we decided to try the Rotisserie Chicken Flat Bread ($8) - also loved this one too.  This flat bread was surprisingly larger than expected - a bonus!  Basil pesto, pepper jack cheese, and tomatoes completed this wonderful flat bread.    I feel like this is the first time in a long time that I've liked every appetizer that I've eaten in one sitting, especially for happy hour.  The food was quality to me.  The portions weren't skimping at all.  And I didn't have to complain about something being dry to the bone or stale.  2 thumbs up for the kitchen staff and menu selection!",

The burger is fantastic, the steak salad is phenomenal, and the frozen margaritas are on fire!! They happy hour menu is quite large but you do have sit at the bar or on the high tops in front of the bar, and they fill up quickly! If you're not there just before happy hour, you won't have much luck until 7pm because the restaurant is on the same lot as two huge corporate buildings.",

Roo was very friendly and attentive throughout the evening. A nice blend of stopping by enough without being a nuisance. I asked if they made a \"Blood and Sand\" cocktail and was pleasantly surprised to learn they could. Oh, by the way, it was great.  For an appetizer, we shared the green chili stew, which is one of my favorites. A basket of different types of bread was brought to the table. The small corn muffins are excellent. The night we were there they had a special of duck carnitas. Served in a skillet, a generous portion of duck, avocado, onions and jalapeno, and corn tortillas. Outstanding! This place never disappoints",

Sadly. The establishment got rid of the all night happy hour after labor day. This was to much surprise since it was so popular. And sadly we had to stop coming for such reason. I thought it would be nice to leave a review of the \"good times.\" Thanks for a great summer. Maybe next summer you could do it again. Till then see you roaring fork forever.

For the appetizer I went with the tortilla soup, and it was one of the best I've had. Then for the main course I went with the buttermilk chicken which came with mash & peppercorn gravy. It was excellent and would order again.   I especially like the service. One of my buddies had his steak a tad overcooked; and the server was spot on - meaning she was apologetic, quickly got it rectified, and took it off the bill at the end of the night. If you read my posts you know I love good service...and it's not about the mistakes, it's how you bounce back from them that counts.  When I'm in Scottsdale, I would go back here for sure. Next time I'll try the fish tacos b/c those looked good.",

I literally walked out thinking everything on the menu, I easily would've spent $5-12 more for that.  Only reason for 4stars instead of 5 is that they brand themselves as a steakhouse, and though they sell steak, it doesn't have that steakhouse vibe or menu. Cheers to the chef, and I raise a glass to the owner and staff for running a great place. I'll be recommending my friends as this is one of the best spots in the area",

I came here off of other yelp recommendations when I was in town for work and finding this place was a little tough because it's tucked in an office complex but not impossible to find and signs are posted for your direction.   I chose the duck and was not disappointed it was cooked medium to perfection with a perfectly crisped skin. It was packed full of flavor and I enjoyed every bite as much as the first!   The breast was served with a cherry sauce on top of a bed of thinly sliced brussel sprouts that tasted pretty good but were drenched in the cherry sauce so I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the rest of the dish. All around a great duck dish would definitely order again.",

    "text": "Another sparkling review for the AHHHMAZING happy hour!   This was our first visit, but both of us have had Roaring Fork bookmarked for awhile. We had cocktails (spicy marg  & Manhattan, $6 each on HH and you even get the extra in a cocktail shaker!) and ordered the BLT wedge salad to start. I'm fairly certain we were audibly oohing and ahhing over the salad; how a simple wedge salad could be so good is beyond me, but there we were! Honestly, every element was perfect.  Next up we split the Big A$$ Burger and the Braised Short Ribs. Unfortunately, we are currently avoiding carbs, so we chose the asparagus and a side salad, but the green chili mac n cheese looked and smelled heavenly. The burger may truly be the best value in town. It was phenomenal and HUGE; we easily could have shared just this and the salad and been stuffed...for under $20! The short ribs were equally fantastic and just melted in your mouth.  Service impressed us. Our server was super busy but on top of things and we were well taken care of. We were lucky enough to quickly snag a table as someone was leaving, but know that's not usually the case - expect to wait.  It's only been 3 days, but I'm already planning another visit later this week.",

One of them and for sure the most annoying is no happy hour prices at your table. I perhaps, with a little help, might understand this rule for food, but for drinks? Why in the world?!! The service was pretty phenomenal both times I was there, at the tables by the bar and at the dinning are. The bar itself, not so good.  Location and parking are good. The bad ass burger is great. The fillet minion was perfect and the sides were OK. The cheesecake pretty good too.  The classic margaritas are already made and served from a jar. Not my favorite.  There are a couple of low hanging fruit that, if changed, I could rate this fine venue a 4, but today? A 3 it is.",

We started with the queso con carne for an appetizer and it was delightfully creamy and very tasty (we could have licked the pan!). Next for our main courses, my mom got a delicious filet cooked medium well and I got the double cut pork chop, both very juicy with flavor. We split a twice baked potato (thank goodness because it was more than enough for 2 people!) and that was our favorite part of the meal.  Our server was kind, attentive, and very personable. Service was above and beyond.  Overall, this is a place you will want to check out if you're visiting Scottsdale!",

When the bartender is ready for the hoards to enter he rings a big cowbell to begin the giant rush for seats. I expect Pavlov's dog would also be salivating after the cowbell wails it's feeding signal.  There is a reason for all the excitement. RF serves up generous pour cocktails and really good eats for virtually no money during happy hour. They have a $6 Manhattan that lights my candle. As far a food goes, try the kettle of green chili pork for a mere $8. It would feed a third world family for a week  If you get there much past 4:30 you can kiss the bar and happy hour good bye. It will be full.. This happy hour is no secret and you will be beat to the tables by those with no job. if you're lucky enough to get a seat during happy hour, consider yourself lucky and enjoy the deliciciousness.

There are only two issues with Roaring Fork.  1) The WIFI is horrible. If I'm eating/drinking by myself I want to be able to have access to a decent WIFI. While it looks like you connect, it never seems to work.  2). Desserts. You can't have the same 4-5 everyday. You need a new pastry chef or one if you don't have one.   Yes. These are little issues in the scheme of things. I love the food, drinks, and the bartenders. But they need to address these two items.",

I had a friend come in from out of town, so I took here her because I knew she had to try this place out. The service was ok. Our server, offered us some free dessert for our special occasion, but before he even asked us what dessert we wanted, he had already charged us for two desserts. We did not have any time for desserts in the first place, so we declined the free dessert, and he fixed our bill. Just a small mistake everything was good.   The three of us that were there had all worked in the Service industry and know how important it is to be tipped cash. We left a cash tip, and wrote \"cash\" on the tip line. We left feeling good!  Unfortunately, the server Austin, tried to add $35 tip on top of what we tipped him to our bill. We checked our credit card statement and found a charge of almost double what we paid.  I have no idea how someone \"accidentally\" adds a tip like that to someone's bill. It's a little too coincidental that he tried to add desserts to our tab and then a $35 tip on top of that. I didn't want to have to write this review, but I do not think management is doing anything about this scenario, so I just want to make sure no one else is the victim of getting money added to their bill when the servers cash out at the end of the day.",

Very attentive, great personality, had great recommendations and was knowledgeable about the menu. Overall very pleasant waiter.   To start, we ordered the queso con puerco as an appetizer. Let me tell you, my husband and I both agreed that it's the BEST queso we've had in Phoenix. It's queso with green chili pork and salsa verde and for whatever reason, this concoction is pure perfection. Like seriously.  Now on to our entrees....hubby pretty much knew what he wanted before we even arrived. He ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. It was tender, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The dish is actually pretty big. My husband ALWAYS eats all of his food; never any leftovers. He has a few pieces left over tonight!  I had the rainbow trout with almonds and green beans as the side that came with it. I was pleased. While it wasn't jaw dropping amazing, I still enjoyed my meal. We'll definitely be back and will request Adam. Thank you for a great dinner tonight Roaring Fork!",

They were pushing  their  wine list . And appetizers.  My guest  ordered  a flat bread which was a little  soggy and salty probably  the cheese.  I tried their short ribs which was too saucy . The ribs were overcooked  not like what was promised.  They were slow is refilling our water. Finally tried their pecan pie . It was OK not great",

The server basically said the chef was unable to be creative and find a way to add flavor to the salmon, the answer was it has pepper on it. We had suggested she likes spicy, and we got \"it can have pepper\". With the lack of creativity we switched to the steak and ordered asparagus, again we asked for spice and creativity, instead we got plain steak and steamed asparagus. What a let down...  The short ribs were good, but there was way too much horseradish in the mashed potatoes, and the cherry chutney was a weird accent.   We will not be back",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I only went to the happy hour.  I live across Roaring Fork and have meaning to come here for a while now. I came with a couple of friends and was able to try a few options on the menu. The first thing I would say is that they don't skimp on happy hour foods. The portions are large and we were all definitely full when we left (and tipsy, but I'll talk more about that later).  Food we got: 1- Guac: Eh. Honestly, I've had better. For $7, it was a little expensive and not very worth it. I wouldn't recommend getting this.  2- Green Chili Pork: The pork was really tender and the flavors were pretty good. I wouldn't go back just for this, but if I were to go back, I would order it again. They give a really large amount of this and the jalepeno that came with it was just the right amount of spicy :) 3- Tortilla Soup: Another mediocre dish. However, it was exactly like what they described (with the rotisserie chicken, avocado and tortilla strips) so I guess there isn't anything to complain about. 4- Burger: This was good. From the reviews, I expected something amazing. However, it is great for the price and definitely filling. It was HUGE and the fries that came with it were also pretty good.  Drinks: Huckleberry Frozen Margarita: This was SO strong. I drank about 1/3 of my drink and gave up. I really appreciate the fact that they give you so much alcohol, but I really did not need that much.  Citrus Mojita: Eh. Not great. It wasn't citrus-y enough for me, but that may be just personal preference.   Overall, it was fine but I do want to try it for regular dinner one night because I have had friends give Roading Fork raving reviews.",

    "text": "Man , I hate doing this, but in True yelp fashion, I have to ding em HARD!   I never ding hard.  But this was a BAD EXPERIENCE!     Let me back up!?  We are in Phoenix for a weeklong vacation over the valentines day week and on holiday with me , my wife, mother and father - in law, we book this reso with OpenTable  for 4 and they get us hooked in.  All is well, we get a confirm phone call, my wife also calls and requests the patio for seating, asks about happy hour everything sounds awesome, we are all in.  All is confirmed.  I have 5 emails , 1 call and we are all set.   I thought, but remember VALENTINES DAY at 5pm IS A TOUGH NIGHT for restaurants, especially this one!.     Well this restaurant was something, here we go hold on kiddies, it may get rough from here on out so hold on.  We walk in, its not horribly busy, but they have 50 in the bar, fighting for seats, it looked like an old, retired, 4pm happy hour crowd, it was classic, all feeding on whatever was out there, it was a mosh pit of old people, retirees in Phoenix I assume.      So they seat us quick, very cordial, but the old lady behind the reservations system didnt know how to operate the computer so the NERVOUS Matre De or GM, whatever was instructing over her shoulder, whatever..new person at the desk..so we get seated and we are in a dark corner behind a pole.  At this point I go speak to the Matre De and ask if we can sit in the bar or on the patio.  Remind you, I reserved PATIO on the RESO.   He says NO, your reserved seating is inside here.   OK, what about giving us the happy hour pricing you promised us in our current seats.  NOPE.  No deal.   hmm...I go back to talk to my party, they are life lets leave.  I say let me talk to bumbles bly at the front computer, maybe she is in charge.  She has no clue, I told her if you cannot fix our seating, or honor your deal we got via the phone call to you less that a week ago, we are leaving!    Ok, BYE!    REALLY!   BYE!  Ok, we are off , as I walked into the parking lot with my $350 I had budgeted for this meal, I said to my wife, and her folks, they should call this place the ROARING F-YOU, it was deadpan, they were not amused!  We happily called a wonderful restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale, and I would totally recommend them as a 5 STAR!  Citizens Public House, they had a table waiting by the time we got there from ROARING F-YOU , and they were happy to see us.  I dont get it, the food smelled delicious, reviews were pretty stellar, we called talked, communicated, all was on, then a F-YOU and we dont care.  Is this Scottsdale Attitude I hear about, or just stupidity?    If I was the owner I would fire the GM, the door that night, or rethink my service standard.  Weak, I if I could have given them less than 1 star I would have given them a HALF star, place smelled delishious and I was ready to go off on the drinks and food.  Missed opportunity.  I would love a reply from management, maybe I missed something on there end.      Moving on.....I will not return.   BOooo...!  Hiss.....a big miss.....",

I selected the cab to go with the RF \"Big Ass Burger,\" even though I wanted to try the zin.  Did I choose wrong?  I'll try the zin next time.  Since I enjoyed the chile-pistachio bread last week, I asked if I could have the commercially-made burger bun swapped out with the new-recipe chile-pecan bread.  No problem.  Ordered it medium, no pickles.  By the time I had thought to take photos of the burger (I was starving so I dug right in!), the scene was a mess!  From the very first slice, the longhorn cheddar-topped patty crumbled into many pieces- I kept wishing I had a spoon to scoop them up!  No matter, as it was still a wonderful meal- loved the smoked bacon, and the chipotle mayo worked well both as a burger condiment and as a dip for the wonderfully crisp and seasoned fries (see photos).  If only there are more happy hour meal selections (only two, excluding the salads) for me to enjoy.  Guess I'll be forced to try the Huckleberry bread pudding with creme anglaise and vanilla bean ice cream next time... woe is me ;)",

Now, on the drive to the hotel, our driver recommended the \"Big Ass Burger,\" which I didn't order, because it was literally a BIG ASS burger. It was the size of my ASS! I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Our group did order the spicy jack fondue with apples, yams (?) and the best crouton thingys ever! In addition to loving mac anc cheese, I love all things with cheese in them, so this was perfect.   Dinner - I had the filet mignon. Come on, it was on someone else's tab, I had to do it. It was a piece of meat and nothing else. It was cooked to perfection, so I was extremely happy.   Dessert, well the chocolate cake was meh. Even though it had chiles of some sort in it for southwestern flair. It was WAY TOO dense! I could only handle ONE bite, and that's saying something because I love sweets and could eat them all day long. The creme brulee was much better.  But get the Green Mac and Cheese!!!",

They have a nice southwestern take on a lot of dishes that are recognizable, but I appreciate that Roaring Fork puts their own spin on things.    They offer a lovely bread basket with hot rolls and mini cornbread muffins with soft, whipped butter--a nice way to start of the meal.  We haven't tried a lot of apps but highly recommend their flatbread chicken pizza, which can also work as a meal.  The cheese they use melts so well and creates a really creamy texture paired with moist, rotisserie chicken.  Delicious!    The Spinach Chicken Waldorf Salad is amazing!  The chicken they use is the spit-roasted chicken, which is juicy and flavorful.  The salad is incredibly large, especially for the price and contents, with a good mix of ingredients, texture, and flavors.  My husband is a fan of the flavors of the \"Big Ass\" burger as well as the Cedar-Planked Salmon.  The Sugar-Cured Duck Breast was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy skin and great flavors between the duck and the accompaniments.  Would also highly recommend the green chili macaroni and cheese; decadent, rich, and luxuriously creamy.   We had their seasonal pie, pecan, which was warm, rich, and deep in flavor, and they paired it with plenty of ice cream (because nothing cuts sweet like sweet!).",

The only thing I will tell u that my trout came with green beans, they do them very crisp. I asked the waitress to cook them well done? I mean soft, they turned out perfect!  A cheesecake was presented for my birthday, delicious! Thanks to Danielle our server, she was awesome!",

The sliders are a bit weak - 2 per order, comes on a plate with some horseradish and aujus and fries.  The sliders themselves are actually small bits of sirloin meat.  With the sauce it was actually quite tasty.  The waiter kinda spilled au jus into the horseradish while delivering the plate which kinda made it look unappetizing but I'm glad we pushed through.  :P  The green chili pork is very good.  I like the hint of spice and large chunks of pork.  It comes with a couple of grilled tortillas.    We also tried the chicken flatbread which was a bit more oily than I thought it would be but the pesto flavor really comes through and the chicken bits on top were plenty.    The big ass burger was also delicious, however, a bit dry.  At $11 it really should be juicier.. afterall there are many ten dollar burger places one can go to in that area.  All in all, it's a decent spot for happy hours with friends.  The drinks are a bit weak and they charge $5 each.  There probably are some better spots but I would recommend trying at least sporadically.",

With some help from Amanda, a waitress, we got a table at 6 and proceeded to have an outstanding meal at a great price.  We ordered appetizers, Guacamole, and a flat bread, and several cocktails at $5 per drink.  For main courses we all,shared orders of filet mignon sliders, the big ass burger (appropriately named) and fish tacos.  Finished off sharing a slice of cheesecake and creme brulee. Everything we ate was outstanding and the value was terrific.  Drinks were also excellent. Best of all, Amanda, our waitress could not have been any better.  She treated us great, explaining offerings, recommending, displaying a lot of humor and personality etc.  I wish all wait people everywhere were like her.  Next trip to Scottsdale will include a stop at the Roaring Fork. For happy hour or a regular dinner it is a quality restaurant.",

I was under pressure to find a restaurant that all 10 in our party would like (including 2 children; ages 2 & 7).  I looked on Yelp and picked the Roaring Fork based on the reviews.   It's in an office building, but don't let the outside fool you.  It is very nice inside and looks like it would seat ~200 easily.  We went on a Monday evening about 6pm and we had about a 10 min wait without reservations.  I would recommend reservations for any weekend or for special occasions, I can see this place getting busy. The service was good and the food was excellent!! When you walk in you will notice chickens on the rotisserie straight ahead and the wonderful smell. 2 people had their \"Big Ass Burgers\" and said they were great.  2 people had their Ribeye and said they were cooked perfect and were very flavorful.  2 people had the rotisserie chicken (including myself) and it was yummy (the corn bread stuffing was the best).  1 had Braised Ribs and thought the BBQ sauce was sweet and tangy.  1 had Fish Tacos and enjoyed them, as well. Overall our entire group was very impressed with the amount and quality of our food.  Everything was well prepared and very tasty. Oh, and the mini corn muffins were delish too!!! Highly recommend!!!",

Then you find yourself at Roaring Fork and think \"Oh ya, this is some seriously fine dining!\"   With simply superb menu items that are excellently prepared and served, to the relaxed Arizona atmosphere that is not at all stuffy or pretentious, and service that is barre none, Roaring Fork is positively a delight. I don't normally think to order mussels in the dessert, but the bowl of mussels cooked with locally made chorizo is excellent as a group appetizer, or as I had it; for my entree. I also loooove the green chili Mac & Cheese!  From my first dinning experience there - which was over 6 years ago now, to my latest encounter with a group of 6 other Yelp CM's, I honestly can say I highly recommend having you next meal in Scottsdale at the Roaring Fork.

We began the night with the shrimp scampi special. The scampi special was a mixture of a lime sauce, roasted tomatoes & grilled shrimp served over four slices of toasted french bread (the appetizer was outstanding!). My boyfriend & i also ordered the teriyaki salmon and the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. Both of the entrees were executed and presented beautifully. Although each meal that is consumed is rather delicious, roaring fork should improve the customer service that is provided.",

Lucky for us it was located across the street from the Kimpton FireSky hotel; it was easy to locate.  We sat at the bar during their 4-10pm happy hour and could not stay away; visited 3 times during our 5 day trip. Stephen made our happy hours most enjoyable; along with George and Heidi. Stephen brings happiness to all sitting at the bar; his martinis are the fullest you will ever enjoy.    The food was excellent; big ass burger, pork chili, salmon... You will be surrounded by locals that visit weekly which tells you how awesome the food, drinks and overall comfortable atmosphere this place has. While we were there one evening a chef from another prominent restaurant was eating in the bar area too -  he loves the food!   I will definitely return whenever I am visiting Scottsdale. Highly recommended!",

They don't take reservations, they don't take numbers for tables, it's just first come first serve. This means that to get a table, most people would just wait like normal human beings, however, some choose to hawk over tables until people leaving, asking them if they are leaving soon, etc. It creates a bad atmosphere and can really invite an unpleasant element.  So 5 starts for food, drink, service and ambience.  Negative 5 stars for that policy...and that policy affects the entire happy hour experience...you can do better Roaring Fork, common now!",

It had thin slices of delicious cheese and really got my attention.  If they can make a ceaser salad taste this good I must be in for a real treat!  The next course didn't disappoint, I had the Delmonico, a 16 Oz ribeye, served in a cast iron skillet...  OMG this may have been the best steak I've ever had!  Perfectly prepared and seasoned it was just amazing... I'm sad to talk it up too much because my wife had the duck with the green chilie mac-n-cheese which is so good, that I hate to talk u out of it... but that's always on the menu and the delmonico is special just for RW!  Got to try both desserts too... The creme brulee is good and pretty to look at but my vote goes to the pecan pie it's a little chocolate, a little caramel-brown sugar gelato and a lot of wonderful!  It tastes just like Christmas!  But my wife makes homemade turtles for the holidays so that may explaine it...  sorry if pics are dark but I think u can see what I'm talking about!",

    "text": "Happy hour heaven. What does this vegetarian order from this meat and potatoes place? GREEN CHILI MAC N CHEESE!! That is all I need and all I could ever want. I dream of it.   My hubby and I have never actually eaten in the restaurant area, just the bar. The happy hour is awesome. They have amazing cocktails for about $5 each. The margaritas are so refreshing. They have martinis on special too with decent vodka and gin. I always order a dirty martini and it comes out perfect, with delicious blue cheese olives. And the portion is generous... their is usually enough in the shaker for one and a half martinis.   My husband orders either the Big Ass burger or the green chili pork stew. Both he said are phenomenal with a generous portion but he has a special place in his heart for the Big Ass burger. It is always cooked exactly how he asks for it, which he is picky about. The fries it comes with are tasty. I have stolen many off his plate.  On to the the mac n cheese... it comes out bubbling hot in its own kettle. The top is a layer of crunchy goodness. It is gooey, green, and a bit spicy. It is HEAVEN. I end up scraping the crunchy bits off the side of the kettle. It is THAT good.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the restaurant but the patrons. There is almost always a wait in the bar area of people eager to take advantage of their great happy hour. While some people are nice, some are total A-holes. I don't know if it is the area, after all it is Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, but there is an entitlement issue going on. I have had many people try to snatch a table or bar seats from us when we were waiting longer than they were. We had to stand our ground and things have been unpleasant at times. We are nice people... we have pointed out tables to people who are waiting before us. Unfortunately, most patrons of this bar aren't  nice. I think it would be great if they ran a wait list in the bar area or if the staff stepped in somehow. It sucks having to deal with these snotty and rude people and makes waiting for our table an unpleasant experience.  Once that business is over though, it is a wonderful experience. Delicious grub, perfect cocktails, great service, and nice environment. Minus the A-holes...",

Not realizing the power of the extreme heat and extreme humidity, we decided to walk to the roaring fork from our hotel.  We quickly found a seat in the bar, and were immediately greeted by two wonderful servers (whose names I do not recall). We started with guacamole as an appetizer, along with a huckleberry margarita and an adult Arnold Palmer. The guacamole was okay, nothing to write home about but not bad by any means. We also ordered 2 big ass burgers for our entrees. We finished with a huckleberry cobbler ala mode for dessert.  Service was absolutely fantastic. Our servers were incredibly personable and gave us great insight on where else we should stop in Scottsdale. I want to say that it was the best service I've ever received at any restaurant.  The cherry on top was the huckleberry margarita.  I think I drank three. It was perfectly strong, perfectly tart, and perfectly sweet. I honestly dream about this margarita. It's been almost a year, and I can still taste it when I think about it.  Scottsdale is not on our planned route for our trip back to San Diego in June, but we will be going out of our way to go there again.",

    "text": "Wanted to try this place after multiple lists cited the Big Ass Burger as being one of the top ten burgers in the greater Phoenix area.  Meh.  I've experienced better.  Went on a Thursday night.  Restaurant has an upscale feel (Scottsdale!  Imagine that) and was decently full.  No reservation, no problem.  Were seated relatively quickly by the hostess after being ignored for about three minutes by the male host, who was more interested in talking on the phone than making eye contact with any of the three groups standing in front of him.  The waitress was pleasant and attentive, and a good sport when I told her I would settle for the \"tap water\".  That's right, first question was if we wanted any fancy water, or if we were fine with the \"tap water\" they just poured in our glasses.  Ha ha - tap water.  Pretentious much?  It was delicious tap water, though.  The water pipes in Scottsdale must be less rusted than those in neighboring, less-cultured cities.  On to the food!  The Big Ass Burger was, in fact, quite large.  However, ordering it medium-rare means you get it pink throughout (whoo!) and dry as hell (suck!).  Not sure how they managed that, but they did.  Definitely far from one of the ten best in the greater Phoenix area.  On another note, my female accompaniment greatly enjoyed her Waldorf Salad, coconut green tea, and creme brulee.  I would recommend the coconut green tea.  Everything else I could've done without.  Maybe I'll give you another try, Roaring Fork.  Maybe.",

From what the locals mentioned, the Huckleberry Rita and the Fish Tacos were a must. They were right! They were both delicious. The drinks were strong (for me, that's great. If you don't like strong tequila then beware!) I would also recommend the Mexican Street Corn as a side dish if you want something else to munch on. The only reason I give this a 4 stars is because my mother's meat (Pork Tenderloin) was not cooked to her liking. She asked for medium-well and it came out very pink and looked raw. The wait for our food after we ordered was also a rather long wait. Other than that- food was delicious. Would come back if I were to visit the area again.",

The ambiance is nice, but it smells like burning wood. The acoustics are great. You can wear whatever you want, although I would recommend dressy jeans or pants and a nice shirt. We had the lamb pop fondue for an appetizer and it was crisp, tender, and juicy. I didn't think I'd like it. We received two bread baskets. I was not fond of the cornbread muffin, but they are popular. I don't like cornbread anything, but I tried it anyway. For the main course, we had the pork and salmon. Both were delicious. Service was impeccable. Prices are high but worth it. For some, this would be considered a \"special-occasion restaurant.\" My only complaint was the price of wine. $15 a glass for normal everyday wine. I would suggest getting a bottle. I will be back to try the filet.",

I also had the sliders from the happy hour menu, which were equally delicious. So far this is the best bbq place I've been to in Scottsdale. More of a neuvo-bbq than your traditional pulled pork sandwiches and mac & cheese, but amazingly good none-the-less. You MUST go.",

It's a boring menu that seemed it hasn't  changed since a decade or two, food was totally over cooked (both my sockeye salmon for $30! and husbands burger), burger had more bun than anything else, starters were bland. Despite mentioning in the reservation it was a Birthday dinner, we were seated at one of the smallest tables right across from food pick-up and on the main way to the bathrooms. The open kitchen was very loud with the staff yelling orders and banging pots non-stop. Other than an Birthday card (?!), nothing special was done - not even a small piece of cake for desert. No one bothered to ask how our food was. Waiter kept vanishing for long periods, two other brought our food and cleared the table. Definitively not coming back.",

I can honestly say that I've had better steak at longhorn and its the same every time I do go there.  But I will say that the big ass burger my son had was delicious!!",

I was visiting Phoenix with family celebrating my sister's 40th birthday and wanted something different from the resort food we had been eating the last few days. The Roaring Fork's happy hour was just the thing! We managed to find a table outside - we later learned on Sunday evenings this can be nearly impossible - and enjoyed the green chile pork nachos, green chile pork and some side salads. The nachos were enormous and absolutely delicious! We devoured them and contemplated ordering another until our salads arrived. They were also incredibly large for a happy hour yet fresh and delicious. The happy hour offerings were fantastic - the food was delicious and the service was quite good despite how busy the restaurant was. I would love to get the name of our server in fact. He is attending ASU pursuing a degree in Supply Chain management. His customer service and attention to detail was demonstrated consistently and I would have offered him an interview on the spot if I had his contact info. I would definitely go back!",

As well as the pork stew with tortillas was really good. 5.00 martinis, wine, margaritas. Definitely a deal for the area where $14.00 cocktails are the norm.

They accommodated our group of 7 immediately and got us seated with drink orders. Our Server Amy was very professional and took very good care of us. She definitely helped turn our night around and we ended up having a great evening full of really good food and a ton of laughs. We actually stayed an hour after they closed without feeling rushed by anyone.   I highly recommend this restaurant. You won't be disappointed",

Even with high expectations from our first visit, this restaurant did not disappoint. We were seated at one of the chef's booths and it was very entertaining watching all the action from the kitchen coordinated with the busy traffic of the servers. General Manager Matt stopped by to chat with us which made us feel very welcomed. We ordered my favorite dish, Braised Beef Short Rib, again and it was every bit as delicious as the first time. Hubby ordered the bacon wrapped pork loin and it was amazing! The bacon was crispy and the pork loin was juicy and cooked to perfection (medium). Through out the meal, manager Mark who was working near by answered all our questions about the beautiful dishes that were leaving the kitchen and even gave us some cooking tips. What an experience we had dinning at the Roaring Fork! I can't wait to return to Scottsdale to dine there again.",

The filets were good; had the rest of the meal been equivalent I could see potential for a 4 rating.  The Ribeyes are what killed the meal....both were very grisly and difficult to eat. The side potatoes and asparagus were fine but average.  Re dessert, the Creme Brulee and the Pecan torte were both fine and ended the meal on a better note.  We would have ordered coffee but it wasn't offered until we were finished.  If we come back I'll stick to the burger they are famous for.  I saw a few go by and they looked delicious.",

I'd definitely recommend this place for dinner.",

While I'm sure this is the trendiest of eateries in town (I was the youngest person at happy hour by about 10 years!), the Old West spirit of simple, wood-fired grub is both timeless and ageless.   Named after a river in Colorado, thing big and gutsy, and that translates to fall-off-the-bone baby back ribs (smothered in a Dr. Pepper bbq sauce, no less), green chile mac 'n cheese, and smashed potatoes. The food here is meant to satiate and stuff, in all the right ways. My only regret was not trying their infamous \"Big Ass Burger\" but that just leaves room for another visit one day.  P.S. If you can handle it, figure out a way to try their Pineapple Cornmeal Upside Down Cake; I'm not sure if it really embodies the Southwest or anything, but it sure tastes good!",

The service was great, the food was delish and, in my opinion, the company was awesome!!  And we still got in on Happy Hour before we were seated.    When I was growing up my favorite food was my Mom's fried chicken.  So my birthday dinner was always fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  Needless to say it's been years since I've had that meal on my birthday so I was pleasantly surprised when I found fried chicken on the menu at Roaring Fork.  Of course I had to have it!  And it did not dissappoint.  First off it was a huge chicken breast with a wonderful crunchy coating.  It was fork tender and served on a bed of loaded mashed potatoes and gravy.  YUM!!!  I was a very happy birthday girl.    My friends have also written reviews.  Julie K and Vicky T both loved their experience as well.  I am glad since I chose where I wanted to go for my birthday.  I had read the reviews and the Roaring Fork was high on my list of places to try.  I'm glad I chose it.  The atmosphere is a big steak house like but still intimate.  I totally enjoyed my birthday dinner at the Fork!!  I can't wait to go back.  I know I'll think that I'm going to try something else but I'm sure the lure of that fried chicken will be too much.  Somebody stop me!!",

    "text": "The Fork That Roared.  For some reason, maybe due to the name, I thought this restaurant would be just a step above a Chili's or a TGIF--that is to say, a chain restaurant. I should have known better, however, since Lynn W. selected RF for her birthday dinner--and she has excellent taste.  The basket of assorted breads was a fantastic way to start the meal. And the seared scallop appetizer was worthy of a good old-fashioned plate licking--but I abstained. When my pork tenderloin arrived my stomach jumped in anticipation. The tenderloin stretched the breadth of my plate, anchored by a dollop of cheesy grits, and topped with grilled corn and a wonderful sweetly tart sauce. The pork was very tender and cooked until it was rosy in the middle, as I had requested. I never order pork in restaurants because I'm always afraid it will be dry. But after eating each delicious bite of this tenderloin, I will certainly start ordering more pork.  I skipped dessert because I was so full. Instead I sat and marveled at how good the food is at Roaring Fork and took in my surroundings. The ambiance confused me a little, I'll admit, as I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant or something more casual. Regardless, everything I ate was delicious, and everyone in our party agreed. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will happily eat here again.  Plus there's the bonus of being able to play with the branding iron in front of the rotisserie in the entryway when it's late and nobody's watching. ;)  Rawr.",

Service was great, whenever we needed something she was there and bus staff was always close by. We were impressed. There was a surprise when the bill arrived as the low priced items add up.

No, when you order the \"our famous long bone ribs\", you get a stern warning about not underestimating the size of your order that makes you think \"oh my, I'm no-longer not in a place like Kansas\" which is then followed by a delivery of a plate containing what looks like two white Cadillac Escalades covered in cow meat. The \"flavor over meat eaten graph\" was a descending curve from \"OMG this is as good as The Salt Lick in Texas\" to \"I'm bored of eating the same meat\" over the first pound or two, at which point it was prematurely cut short by the limits of my belly. I advise that you go with friends and share different types of cow.  While they have no vegetarian mains, they're happy to turn a salad into a fullsize meal, which was great as this allowed my vegetarian dining partner to fashion a poker visor out of rocket leaves so that she could avoid watching the carnage on my side of the tablet.",

I had the carnitas and the pork just fell apart with an amazing flavor. My husband had the steak and while it was $$ It was worth it. So delicious. The pecan wood they fire it in makes for an amazing flavor. The asparagus must be cooked over the same wood bc it is so good and usually asparagus is nothing to write home about.

    "text": "5 stars for the RF happy hour!  Given the high quality of food and service at these prices, this must be  the best bargain in town!   We came on a recommendation by a trusted friend who told us we had to order the Green Chile Pork Stew ($7).  It came in a small iron kettle that kept the pork nice and hot.  We were not disappointed - the pork was tender and succulent infused with layers of spicy flavors.   We also ordered the Fondue Pot ($9) which came with three 1-oz lamb chops, butternut squash and green apples for dunking.  The cheese in the fondue tasted like a mild blend of cheddar and other American cheeses.  The lamb chops were delicious on their own but just a touch over cooked at medium-well.  The contrast of textures between the roasted squash and green apple cubes were great with the cheese.  At the start of the meal, we also ordered the Field Green salad which came with candied pecans, sliced apples, diced beets and warm crusted round of goat cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the plate split for us even though it was only a $5 dish.  The service was great - our water glasses were never less than half empty and our plates were quickly changed.  Happy hour wines are only $5 a glass.  I ordered a red Zinfandel and it was good to see the proper glass brought to me along with a small carafe of wine, allowing for the right pour to facilitate lots of swirling.  It's these small details that sets a restaurant apart.  I don't remember the last time I had this quality of a meal and service for less than $30.  We will most definitely be back and often.",

    "text": "There is a lot to like about Roaring Fork, however a few hiccups lead me to a 3star review - with a couple fixes, I could easily add a star (maybe 2).    Went to Roaring Fork for happy hour last Friday.  It was a fairly warm day, although nothing like the summer days we've been having.  The bar was packed, so we opted for a spot on the patio.  We got there shortly before 5, so we were surprised that it was already that full.  That being said - easy fix, go earlier on a Friday.    The chairs out on the patio are fairly uncomfortable.  I'm not an enormous guy, but I'm also not 120lbs.  The narrow, weird shape of the patio chairs were fairly uncomfortable.  The women with us did not notice a problem - every guy did.  The overall value is great for happy hour.  Most drink specials are $5!  $5 in Scottsdale.  Hard to beat.  The Sweet Carolina (?) was a combo of Sweet Tea Vodka and lemonade - just the right amount of sweetness, very tasty.  The guava mojitos were also a highlight.  Very tasty.  The wife enjoyed the huckleberry margaritas as well.  All $5.    The food was solid.  We shared the green chile pork with warm buttered tortillas.  I'm a bit of a tortilla snob so wasn't thrilled by the thicker (think Mission brand) flour tortillas, but the green chile was very good.  Not really spicy (would have been nice), but great flavor.  The best part of the food in my opinion, was the 1/2 rotisserie chicken with tortillas.  The chicken was perfectly tender, juicy and seasoned.  Great bird.    Service was somewhat slow - but they were jam-packed, and we were outside on a hot patio, so I suppose that can be overlooked.  While they were slow, they were very friendly, very helpful and overall pleasant - just needed to come around a bit more often.  The restrooms, especially for the guys are a bit of a trek.  You walk all the way to the back of the restaurant, make like you're walking back into the office building.  Just before you re-enter the offices, you hit the women's bathroom.  The Men's restroom is actually back inside the office building - just a short walk down the hallway.  A little inconvenient, but let's be honest - I'm not going to count out a restaurant just because their restaurant isn't exactly where I want it.  I have legs, so I can walk.    Overall...3 stars.  I would definitely return.  I would love to sit inside and see if service improves.  I would also prefer to sit at a booth rather than outside on the patio chairs.  Apparently my giant ass was not meant to sit there.  The food and drink, not to mention the happy hour prices make this place more than worth it.",

We could have made dinner out of the bar appetizers, but decided to hit the dining room for dinner. Good move. We opted for outdoors, which was also a good move, because it's much quieter and more pleasant than inside. Hubby's fried chicken was meh, but my fish special (cod on a celery root puree) was yummers as were the deserts...we stuffed ourselves, and still didn't finish the huckleberry cheesecake and the pecan pie with salted caramel ice cream.

I just wanted to cry because of the outrageous price I was going to pay for such a sad meal.

I would recommend the green chile stew, even though I don't really enjoy spicy things. Seems like everyone and their mother come here for that stew. My favorite meal so far has been the Dr. Pepper ribs... fall off the bone delicious. As far as drinks go, their guava mojito is to die for! Get it! Service here is always excellent and I always look forward to my visits here.",

The green chili mac and cheese is a must try. I have also ordered or tried the fried chicken, short ribs, filet mignon and the long bone rib. All are great, to be honest I have never had anything bad there.   The restaurant itself is interesting. It has a bar menu, which I have not had the chance to try, but would like it. The service has always been pretty good, not too great, but not bad. The drinks are also good, they have an extensive menu to choose from. Even though it is an expensive meal, it is definitely worth a try.",

Something seemed very charming about eating bar-side in an upscale restaurant, chatting with the keep, fire roaring off in a corner, and well-dressed patrons enjoying celebratory or power-meeting meals like green chile pork stew, slow roasted pork prime rib, and Dr Pepper Braised Beef Short Ribs.    I like their wood-roasted concept and works well in its only two locations worldwide, downtown Scottsdale and downtown Austin.   I would personally have a big-time, celebratory event here as it is worthy of such an occasion, but also worthy of a nice little meal up on the bar.",

Amazing food, and amazing service makes for a spectacular evening out...wouldn't you agree? :)   The Roaring Fork sponsored the 2008 Arizona yoga asana championships which took place in Tempe last weekend. Following the competition, competitors, teachers, and volunteers were all invited to enjoy dinner courtesy of Roaring Fork! From the moment I walked in the restaurant all of my senses were stimulated-from the delicious smells to the wonderful decor to the terrific music playing, it was perfect! We enjoyed amazing appetizers and a wonderful plank salmon. Our sides included macaroni and asparagus that was to die for. Although I don't usually indulge in dessert, I figured I could reward myself for participating in the competition and enjoy the chocolate lava cake which I am still dreaming about!",

After hearing so many positive reviews, I finally tried it out last week but couldn't say I was overwhelmed by my experience.  The tortilla soup ws okay, nothing special - could have been more spicy. I had the seared tuna as my entree. While the presentation was beautiful, the flavors were a bit too extreme - however, the roasted beets were a nice touch, but the salsa did not fit with the dish.  The bacon biscuits in the bread basket were out of this world.  Service: prompt, very attentive, and unobtrusive.  Conclusion: overrated!",

We were seated immediately, the entire staff was very courteous the entire time we were there and always made sure we did not need anything. The food was very delicious and the bartenders there really know there stuff and make quality drinks. I would absolutely recommend getting the lamb chop fondu because it was amazing and delicious, although the portion was very small and it was a little pricey, it was worth it. We also got the spit-roasted chicken which was also very delicious and filling, although I do have to say that the corn-bread stuffing did not work well with the gravy they used. The ambiance in the restaurant was very nice, it was dim-light but provided a nice ambiance, especially if you wanted to take someone on a date. Overall the experience was very good and I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Only negative I will say is that the regular menu is pretty pricey, but I do think that you are paying for the quality. They also have happy hour from 7-10 I believe.",

The service was exceptional and the wine glasses were never empty.    The appetizers were a buffet of Mexican favorites which were all delicious.  I ordered the Dr Pepper Rib and tasty does not begin to tell the story.  It was cooked so perfectly that all I needed was a butter knife to cut it up.  It was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  To finish off  great meal I had creme brulee which I couldn't even finish.  Not because it wasn't great (it was) but I was so full from the meal.

Red and gold beets cooked in their wood fire grill served with an amazing citrus infused whipped goat cheese and chive oil made in-house with pine nuts.  The second was the pork belly that was just divine. In addition we ordered the green chili mac and cheese. While this is not one of the executive chef's creations it really is a delicious dish and now I know how it's made. Roasted poblanos blended with spinach. To die for!

The food was delicious, the service was great and we were seated right away, no reservations needed. The prices were very reasonable too.  I had the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin which our server recommended. It was so good. The smokiness of the bacon offset the sweet corn perfectly. The cheesy grits on bottom added a nice creaminess to the dish. All the flavors complimented each other. I usually don't like pork tenderloin that much (I'm more of a beef, lamb, wild game or seafood kind of gal), but this dish changed my mind about pork tenderloin. It can be juicy and delicious! My son had the rainbow trout which was delicious and cooked perfectly. Hubby got the 22oz bone in ribeye steak which was huge and cooked a perfect medium rare. It was juicy and flavorful. He also got a side of the jalapeno mac 'n cheese which good too.   Definitely worth checking out if you are ever in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Last night, while discussing dinner, my friend suggested burgers or Asian... And I recalled that Roaring Fork is said to do a good burger, and since it is down the street from the theater, we decided to check it out.  My first impression was that it is very classy.  When taking our order, the server mentioned that she had one order left of a special thick-cut pork chop, which *almost* derailed my plan to try out the Big Ass Burger.  But I stayed strong, and ordered the burger (medium rare, of course).  Along with that, I got the Weinhard root beer (they could do better than Weinhard, but at least they have something in a bottle).  The bread they brought out to the table for us to munch on was superb.  Especially the corn bread.  Someone also randomly brought us an amuse-bouche: it was seared halibut marinated in something and placed on a small piece of toast.  Bringing me small tastes of delicious food I didn't even ask for is the perfect way to win me over!  While waiting for our burgers, I observed the artwork on the wall in front of me - it was a watercolor print of a cowboy's lower legs, wearing boots with an Arizona flag on the leg.  This had to be a Nelson Boren painting, and sure enough, there was his signature in the corner (the piece was \"July In Arizona\").  It's nice sitting down at a restaurant and seeing artwork by someone with whom you once played tennis years ago.  The burgers themselves were excellent - perfectly cooked, topped with delicious chilis and bacon.  The fries were decent, and the chipotle mayo (or whatever that sauce is) works perfectly.  As far as the burger's name, \"Big Ass\" certainly does a swell job describing its size.  It was a good burger, although if you order it more cooked than medium, I could see the meat becoming very dry.  I was impressed with the place - both the food and the decor was excellent.  Next time, I won't be afraid to let a thick, juicy pork chop derail me.",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure of enjoying a delicious meal at the Roaring Fork in Austin and this one, conveniently located across from my Hotel (Firesky) is just as good.  Our party of 8 started with lots of apps. Everyone was super psyched to try the green chili, but I just found it so-so.  However, the mac and cheese was unbelievable. Unfortunately, I don't think many other people at the table got to it because I devoured most of it. Oops.  Their guac totally hit the spot too.  I was pretty full after the apps, but still had some fish tacos coming my way.  Three generous sized flour tacos filled with fish, veggies and rice. I found more room in my tummy for these!   It turned out I needed to find additional room in my stomach because the manager was sweet enough to send out a few comp desserts for our table. You can't go wrong with any of their desserts, but the pineapple cake (apparently a favorite of the Manager's wife) was the best.  Days later I'm still full from my delicious meal at Roaring Fork, but I'm looking forward to filling up again the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

It was full, but to my suprise the waiter \"Robert\" volunteered to hold a table for us, on his own time.  Wow! I was flattered at his generosity considering that never happens.   (If you're new to RF you're learn quickly the happy hour is delightful, both for delicious food and cheap, but fantastic drinks)  Our party of five enjoyed the flat bread, tortilla soup, beet salad, and date salad for starters.  Accompanied by huckleberry margaritas and huckleberry lemonade.  Everything was wonderful. My favorite was the date salad.    Diner I had the duck which was the best duck I've had in my life.  Highly recommended.  Robert our server was also very entertaining with his straight up attitude :) it was very fun and I will Def be back.  I've been here at least 12+ times :)",

The Caesar salad was ok, not good just ok.  The salmon was delicious and the short ribs were amazing.  The size potions of everyone's did vary.  My salmon was small where some were medium and larger.  My wife's short ribs were medium size and other larger.  Both great dishes but I should've gotten the short ribs as well.  Bigger overall and better flavor, not to discredit the salmon's flavor, which was great too.  My brother and I both agreed that we should've done the short ribs.  For dessert there  was a chocolate tart with a spicy ancho chili aftertaste which  most people did not like.  There was a huckleberry bread pudding and a vanilla creme brulee which both were good.  The service was on point for such a large crowd.  The ambiance was a little dark romantic but the lighting was too dark for most phone photography.",

All of their dishes are made fresh, they've got an in-house chicken roaster displayed about 15 feet from the front door that smells amazzzing and invites you right in! Prices reasonable for the portion they provide, which is filling.  The only downside is that if you go in early evening and expect to get happy hour beverages, you can't get them unless you sit in the designated \"happy hour\" section, which there was a huuuuge wait for.  They take reservations for meals but happy hour is first come first serve.  Great date-worthy spot!",

At the price I paid, it should have been unbelievable.  Succulent.  The kind of steak that ruins all other steaks for the rest of your life.  So 4 stars, and I'd go back to this restaurant any day in a heartbeat.  Definitely worth a stop in Scottsdale.",

Waiting another 20 minutes for the drinks come out before we can order any food. I order a margarita for $18  which said it has top shelf liquor. The server brought my drink out, the moment I picked the glass up, it broke into 2 pieces which I didn't even do anything to break it. The whole drink spilled all over my dress. My dress was completely soaked in margarita and all over the table. The server came and gave me some towels and cleaned up the mess. He said he would bring a new drink. After that, we finally can order food. Sitting there with my soaking wet dress on and waiting for another 30 minutes; the food still didn't make to the table. Finally, the food came. The food was good despite all the troubles and suffering I had gone through. At the end, I asked the server for some type of compensation since the glass shattered and spilled over me on my birthday day without my fault. He refused to give any discount, he said he only charged me for one drink. He did give me the free dessert since it was my birthday, but I don't believe the way this restaurant handled the situation was acceptable. It will be \"best\" and most memorable birthday so far. Thanks to Roaring Fork!",

I will suggest the Dr. Pepper prime rib, It was excellent, very flavorful!",

We spilt the happy hour cheese burger and guacamole, both were yummy, but we regretted not ordering the happy hour rotisserie chicken. It looked delicious and was a nice sized portion! I'm definitely going to go back and give it a try.  You have to sit at the bar to get the happy hour prices, but the ambiance there is just as nice as sitting in the main portion of the restaurant and the service was still very attentive.",

    "text": "4.5  there is a SLIGHT reason why i give this place a 4.5... it would have easily been a 5 had the trout i had ordered had a side of rice or veggies on the side. you wouldn't believe HOW BIG the fish was...  anyways...  prior to roaring fork, i went online and decided to scope out the menu and noticed that there were 3 other restaurants by the same owner. so i called and asked what the main difference was... the other 2 places focused primarily on meat/seafood while roaring fork had both. why not enjoy the variety?  we started off with an upbeat, easygoing server. very easy to please with lots of suggestions.... we ended up ordering a side of GREEN CHILI MAC AND CHEESE and my gosh,that mac and cheese blew me away. soo soo damn GOOD.. i would have easily ordered it as an entree and took it to go had they had it on their menu....for $7, that was  no goner! :P  he ordered the $23 some INFAMOUS \"DR PEPPER\" BABY BACK RIBS.. with fries on the side... the fries on the side kinda killed it, but who is it say that it is not an american place to be...  good choice... it was def a nice size... i may be a meat eater but when one orders meat, i tend to go the other way and order fish.... never tried a \"RAINBOW trout\" so i figured that i should be adventurous. for $19, which is a steal, was OH SOO GOOD but that is where my experience went wrong. had they had a side of grilled veggies or rice, it would have been a 5 star experience. EASILY! it was too salty that i left a few bites in between and took it home... it was sauteed with roasted almonds and you wouldn't believe how tasty it was!!!   anyhoo, the portions were quite generous and im definitely stoked that i came here for dinner and oh, not to mention, kudos to playin the USC game!! and yes, the trojans did win! :)  RF also has happy hours and if i was a local, i would totally hit this place up... for the young ins, the crowd is quite ... hmm, what's the word? more of an older crowd, from mid 40s and up, and business casual attire is quite appropriate... but don't let that ruin your experience here...  valet parking is comp and nonetheless, because this place is located in a businessy district, parking is not a problem...  in fact, it felt like irvine, for those who are familiar with so cal.  if the trout had the sides i wanted, i would be a happy camper... i still am, but i didnt really get to enjoy my food.. :( maybe next time RF will hook me up? blah... my next visit to AZ perhaps? atmosphere/service great.. thanks RF!",

The appetizer or starter was the green chili. It had a little bit of a spice to it and it was hot. That's a good sign. I ordered the beef tacos and those things were GOOD!  The beef in the tacos reminded me of pot roast. It was hard to eat the whole taco at once, so you'll have to eat some of the beef of and then you can fold it up and eat it like a taco. There was also some rice with cilantro and that was bland and sort of dry.   My boyfriend had the buttermilk fried chicken. The chicken was sort of dry and kind of salty. The only way it was saved was with the gravy and the mash potatoes. The mash potatoes were GOOD!  Would have had dessert, but I was stuffed after eating the tacos.",

She checked in just the right amount of times, not overbearing and didn't disappear either.  As for the food: the roasted chicken flat-bread was a nice starter, Salad was good and fish tacos were well prepared, not too heavy and tasty. For all of that I would have easily given Roaring Fork 4 stars.  The reason I didn't is that their restroom was an absolute disaster. Yes, its connected with the office building above the restaurant but that is still no excuse. And when I write, \"disaster\" what I really mean is \"disgusting\".  I won't go into detail other than to say, I rarely even notice a restaurant's restroom facilities and have never written a word about one.  But given the amount of business that Roaring Fork does and the amount of money being spent nightly in this place, these guys really need to stretch the budget to get this facility serviced every hour or so to make sure its clean and reflects the standards of the restaurant overall.",

    "text": "Roaring Fork, oh Roaring Fork.  How do I love thee?  Let me counts the ways....  1.....  Okay, I guess I don't really love you.  But I do like you, okay?   First off, what an interesting location.  I could have been killed getting in the parking lot.  I had a reservation for 8:30.  No, my table wasn't ready at 8:30.  I found that very interesting because there was no one waiting in the lobby.  And wouldn't you know, they seated me by the kitchen.  Okay, folks, I know how long your food was sitting there Friday night and it's not pretty.  Their staff is like a bunch of crazy lunatics, but that's okay.  I opted for the Huckleberry Margarita, nice but nothing to write home about.  Doesn't begin to compare with Roy's signature drink, but that's for another review.  The bread basket was full of unhealthy little taste treats, I especially liked the bacon & cornmeal bombs and the buttermilk, bacon, artery cloggers.  Yum, yum, even better slathered in chipotle honey butter.  My salad was great, I opted for the wild greens disguised as the iceberg wedge.  I'm a red meat girl, so I had the 8 oz. center cut filet mignon.  Eight is too much for any girl, so I was unable to finish.  But I did order it medium and since it was barely medium rare, I did have to send it back.  Luckily, I was close to the kitchen, so the re-cook didn't take long.  The flavor of the meat wasn't really remarkable, but satisfactory.  The green chile Mac 'n' Cheese is a really great idea and something that I will try to duplicate at home.  If any of you yelpers have the recipe, I would be interested in it.  Now, I'm thinking that since I didn't finish my steak, my server deemed me not worthy of a dessert, it wasn't even offered!  But that's okay, I guess I didn't really need it.  All in all, pleasant, but nothing to write home about.",

The appetizer was very flavorful the only thing I didn't like is that there was more meat than queso so it was kind of hard to eat. The big ass burger was the best burger I have ever had. It came with chipotle mayo that wasn't very flavorful but the burger didn't need anything added on to it. The meat was amazing and melted in your mouth. I ate half of the burger and was full for the rest of the night.",

    "text": "How does a fork roar? There is a certain zen quality to that question, much like the ever popular \"if a tree falls, yada-yada\" (I know, it's not really yada-yada, but you get the idea). I have been to several restaurants lately named with utensil based nomenclature, or named after the place in which the meal was prepared (Kitchen, Wok, etc.).  I fully expect that trend to continue, but I think it shows a certain lack of imagination. Sometimes that can be helpful, like \"Jimmy's BBQ Pit\"...I know it's likely to be BBQ.  Simply \"Jimmy's Pit\" or \"Jimmy's\" or \"Pit\" wouldn't be helpful (well, \"Pit\" might tell you avoid the place). But generally, I like a little romance in the naming...a little something to pique my interest (having said that I still think the food at Hooters is just not up to the name, but that's a discussion for another time). The Beautiful Carin and I headed over to the Roaring Fork for Happy Hour a couple of nights ago and spent a lovely evening at the bar with Clark, the bartender/server/happy hour ambassador.  The bar is the place to have a happy hour dinner and couple of cocktails. Tables are fine, but the bar is just a better atmosphere!  We hadn't been back for happy hour since Bob McGrath sold the place, but it really hasn't changed (which is a good thing!!). All of our favorites are still solidly on the menu, and the Big Ass Burger is still riding tall at the Roaring Fork Happy Hour!  We started with the green chile pork stew and scotch (why yes, they do have one of my favorites...Bunnahabhain...that always puts me in a good mood!). I had the Big Ass Burger... it truly is a big ass burger and really tasty...it's not Kobe beef, it's just beef, but good beef, cooked correctly! Carin had the Roasted Chicken which was also really well prepared...crispy skin, moist and flavorful! We couldn't begin to eat it all, so DeeDee was delighted with us when we got home:) For the capper, they have started making their own pies, in their wood fired oven. You know what's better than chocolate pecan pie in homemade crust (yeah baby, none of the store bought crap for these Roaring Forkers)...almost nothing! Sex, that's about it. Jeez, I waddled out of there, $50 lighter, but that's a hell of a meal for $50, (including a couple of single malts, a marti and dessert)! So, how does a fork roar?  It roars for thee my friend, it roars for thee.",

I go there thinking it is a steakhouse and it is not.  They do have steak but the menu is more eclectic.  You could say it is a very Arizona menu, which I like but I think it is too pricy for that level of food.  Service has always been just ok as well.  I don't expect glorious service but I do expect more returns to the table and service with a smile.  My suggestion would be, don't go here for a big steak dinner and expect a little less service than you are accustomed to in scottsdale.",

It comes with a side of warm tortillas and is the perfect size for a filling meal without feeling stuffed. The pork was delicious and cooked perfectly. The cheese topping and the extra zing from the chilis made this absolutely delectable. Definitely a must try!

    "text": "Roaring Forks is one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while. A couple friends took me here to celebrate my birthday. For appetizers, we decided on the green chile pork which is served with tortillas and pork wings served with vegetables and a Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce. The green chili pork was flavorful and had a little spice to it but it was not overwhelming. I didn't really know what to expect with the pork wings but they took me by surprise. They were very tasty and tender. The Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce was just icing on the cake. For dinner, I had the buttermilk fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes. The skin was a nice golden brown with a crunch and the chicken breast itself was juicy. I believe they used red potatoes for the mashed potatoes and gravy. The mashed potatoes were good but didn't blow me away. But then again they are just mashed potatoes. I also had a huckleberry margarita to compliment my meal.",

Needless to say, we went away full and extremely satisfied.  The waitstaff was great.  I would recommend a trip to Scottsdale to check this place out.",

    "text": "Let's start with the positive, which begins about an hour after we sat in the bar area - the Big Ass Burger is big and delicious.  Now to the rest:  We ordered the Green Chile Pork appetizer after asking our waiter to help us decide between that and the guacamole and queso.  We take our time ordering dinner because we have an appetizer coming - except that we don't.  When it becomes clear it isn't arriving we start eyeing the kitchen for signs of our dinner.    Our meal shows up much later than our leisurely ordering would have dictated and we advise our waiter not to bring the Green Chile Pork. He responds \"You didn't get that?\"  I was thinking, \"you helped us order it but you didn't bring it, you didn't arrange for it to be brought, and you certainly didn't clear it from our table prior to serving our entrees and still you seem surprised.\"  But because I am on a sarcasm control regimen I just said, \"No, we didn't.\"  Two of us ordered fish tacos which were very tasty but 4 of the six tacos across the two plates served were extremely undercooked.  We are not afraid of fish a bit under temperature but this was well below that.    On the plus side the manager stopped by to apologize.  On the minus side he was unaware that both orders were off.  Plus - he recovered quickly and graciously said he was buying our drinks.  Minus - he comped less than half the drinks.  We were a party of 4 and none of us ordered another drink after his offer so our drinks were fully accounted for on our bill at the time and we were not trying to take advantage. Perhaps he comped just the drinks of the two who ordered the tacos but the meal was interrupted for all as we waited for the re-fire.  On to dessert.  Plus - the good and hot coffee came quickly and the chocolate infused pecan pie was delicious.  Minus - the pecan pie was very small and we were again craning our necks toward the kitchen looking for clues to its arrival as it was served well after the coffee.  Had the tacos been served correctly the first time the taste and quality of the food would have tipped this over to a 3 star review.  The food was really very good but difficult to enjoy when the overall meal was so poorly managed.  We are divided about a return visit.",

I met my boyfriend there around 6pm, and we waited just about 10 minutes until two seats opened up at the bar... The entire bar area was packed though - it's no secret how fantastic the happy hour prices are at RF!  The bar service was perfect - (thanks Ryan) and for a total of $33 before tip, we walked out full from the following: -a glass of Cab Sauv ($5) -a field greens salad with fresh beets, apples, candied walnuts and goat cheese ($5) -fish tacos that came with avocado, tomato, lettuce, salsa ($7) -a half roasted chicken that came with beans, tortillas, avocado, and additional garnish ($12)   We were completely satisfied, ambiance was fun (we made friends with our neighbors on either side), and food was phenomenal!    Helpful hint we were told for next time - if you order the salad and ask them to split it in the kitchen, they will put a full goat cheese fritter on both plates!  We're already planning to order that way next time!  Thanks for another fantastic meal, Roaring Fork - see you again soon!",

We've come here 2 times for company outings and they have been extremely accommodating.   The margaritas and old fashions are made perfectly. The green chile pork appetizer is to die for (yes, everyone is right... ask for extra tortillas). My favorite entrees have been the short ribs and ribeye. I've tried a little of everything, however, and it's all very tasty.   The deserts could be better. I only really like the creme brule, which is hard to mess up, and they make a good one. The strawberries are a nice touch. I wish the bread pudding was better... it is quite bland/boring.",

Great value for the quality of food!  To top it all off, since it was our anniversary, they gave us a free dessert, a rose and a sweet card signed by all the staff.

    "text": "This is more about service, courtesy, and ambiance.  We had reservations through Open Table and requested a booth as we were celebrating a special occasion for just the two of us.  When we arrived at 4:55 for 5:00 pm reservations, we were informed at the podium that seating doesn't start until 5:00 and were requested to wait 5 minutes.  Another couple walked in after us at 4:58 for 5:00 reservations as well and they too were informed the same and were specifically requested to wait 2 minutes.  When we were escorted to our table at 5:01, I was surprised that there was no one seated on that side of the restaurant, so what gives?  Do they really need to have customers wait for tables that were obviously ready for seating? Poor customer service as there was little to no available seating in the entry, making guests stand for not only those with reservations but also those without. How ridiculous!  As we were escorted to a table, not a booth, I noticed also the chairs have wooden slats on the back and we have medical issues which is why we always request a booth and we brought this up with the maitre d'. We motioned to the booth which was set up for 4 and asked if we could be seated there instead.  He disappeared and returned and said he wasn't able to accommodate.  We requested the manager and explained our situation, including the special celebration.  The manager returned a few minutes later and in spite of our medical issues and the event we were celebrating, this manager was hope-less and help-less.  His explanation was that the Open Table reservation didn't specify a booth which was upsetting to both of us, especially since our comfort would be greatly compromised.  Given the time of the evening, we agreed to sit at the table with punishing chairs and ordered cocktails.  We, at that point, finished our cocktails and told our waiter that we weren't able to stay.  Their consolation was that drinks were on the house.  Big deal!  So now where do we go for our celebration?  We called Durant's in Phoenix and they happily took our reservation for 6 p.m.  We enjoyed ourselves, although not in a booth obviously on such short notice, but in very comfortably padded chairs.  We had a great dinner, better than the one we're sure we would've had if we stayed at the Roaring Fork.  By the way, this wasn't our first visit.  We were at the Roaring Fork on the same date last year once again for a special celebration and we were seated in the rear part of the restaurant.  While we were there this time, we were offered that same seating but we declined because of the acoustics and conversations carried over the space become very loud and once again made our experience miserable.  The Roaring Fork is nothing to roar about and if you're planning a special occasion, it would be best to take it to Durant's, with excellent customer service and the menu and food is unbelievably delicious.  So much so, that while we were there, we booked our Valentine's Day reservation as well.  In summary, Roaring Fork, \"Thanks for Nothing!\"  We will never return to your establishment and will make sure others will know of our dissatisfaction with the lousy customer service, courtesy and ambiance, with no less the care and consideration for those with medical issues. The one star rating is only because this review can't be posted without one.",

I had the porkchop and mixed green salad and it was delicious! This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or go on a nice date. Kind of expensive for just quick food.",

The flavor profile was out of out of the world. The macaroni and cheese with the green peppers, was the best mac n cheese I've ever had.  The second night I went it was with a party of 6. I had the bacon wrapped pork loin, cheesy grits, and I'm not going to lie the mac n cheese. The pork was cooked perfectly and paired well with the grits and the basalmic reduction. The mac n cheese was even better. This time it had bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on top before it went under the broiler.  Both nights the restaurant was super packed, bit you didn't en notice because the wait staff was on top of their game.  I highly recommend trying this place if you are in Scottsdale.",

The green chile mac n cheese was so good I wanted to lick the bowl (but was afraid to with the upscale scottsdale elite in the vicinity).  To top it all off, we had the pecan pie with an scoop of ice cream that made our pallets melt with enjoyment.  The only thing better than all this was the service from the amazing \"Amanda M\" whom I now henceforth refer to as Amanda the Magnificent.  She is beautiful, classy, and very attentive, and she makes the place one to remember, and one in which I shall return.  Thank you Amanda for being the best at what you do, and thank you to the Roaring Fork for doing it all so well!  Bon appetite!!",

    "text": "Roaring Fork is strangely located next to some giant business complex.  They share the same parking lot and has every space marked with 2-hour visitor parking.  Since the business closed during dinner time, guests may park freely here.  The restaurant reminds me of an upscale version of Claim Jumpers. Dark, intimate restaurant with a Western theme and open kitchen.  Menu is highly meat-centric, and ideally you bring a large appetite and/or completed a full day of hiking because portions are gigantic!  We started off with a Medjool Date Salad - interesting how dates and that fig jam works with candied walnuts.  To balance out the sweetness, they have arugula and large chunks of goat cheese.  (4 stars)  Wife got the Double Cut Pork Chop. Wood-grilled and served with an awesome squash puree. The chop was huge and had some poblano chutney on top.  I found the meat incredibly soft and juicy, almost unnaturally soft.  The wife felt some of the pork texture and taste was missing some how, and she still felt the best pork chops are served in San Francisco's Prospect. (4 stars)  For some crazy reason, I opted for the Big Ass Burger out of sheer, morbid curiosity.  I could of went for any of their other excellent-sounding entrees but the \"Big Ass\" just sounds so cool.  I indeed lived up to its name and was indeed big - layers of bacon, medium-rare juicy patty, tomatoes, onions, and poblano chili.  Pretty decent burger, definitely bigger but not necessarily better than some of the best burgers I've had.  Fries were super crispy and well-seasoned. (4 stars).  Clearly after that meal there was no room for dessert!",

We sat at the bar and were happily greeted by the sweet bartenders who got us all a famous frozen margarita. We ordered a pizza as well -- because margaritas and pizza, great combo! The ambiance was perfect and service was amazing, even though it was busy.   The reason for my 3-star review was that when we left, a friend asked for food so we ordered the tortilla soup to go, and to be honest, I was quite disappointed with the order we received (see photo). Not sure why the \"cup\" of soup was more than half empty. I even measured it when I got home and it was less than half a cup; don't really think this was worth $8.50 (more expensive than the pizza).   We love Roaring Fork, and come here quite often... Just a bit disappointed in the portion sizes/price this time around.",

Obvs still get there in time for $5 martinis, manhattans, and maragritas and grab an app too but order from the full dinner menu because youbcan go anywhere for a burger. Here they've got delicious carnitas, bacon wrapped pork loin, cedar plank salmon, oh wow. Not amazing for vegetarians, but just make it work with salad if you're willing to come. Dig into a new bite here when you getva chance. Only con is the price is a lil steep for portions. C'est la vie.",

We chose to be seated on the regular patio (apparently there is also a specific HH patio) and started with a nice glass of prosecco & riesling. For appetizers we shared the lamb fondue and mussels & chorizo, both of which were very tasty. And, for our entrees I had the half spit-fire chicken and my hubby had the rainbow trout. Both were cooked perfectly, although the chicken lacked flavor. Note to self, next time go with your gut and order the porter house. Also, portions are very generous so keep that in mind when ordering.    All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Service was great (thanks to Daryl), food was good and the atmosphere was perfect! Despite the strange location in the midst of a big business complex, it was a great find and we'd definitely return.",

From the beautiful, warm cozy wood fire ambiance to the food and drinks and our wonderful server everything was just perfect!!! I ordered the Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin which was highly recommended by our server, my mouth is watering as I'm writing this review a month later!!

I also appreciate that our request for a booth was accommodated.  Our waitress was lovely and attentive. What I did not like was the food- or at least MY food. My guests both had the buttermilk fried chicken which was a great choice. Hot, delicious, crispy, etc. gravy garnish was very good too. One of my guests had a wedge salad which she enjoyed. I ordered the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin. My issue is that it was totally drenched in balsamic reduction which I found offensive. The pork was cooked beautifully but the plating was weird with a ton of 'street corn' on top of a small portion of grits, the pork and then the balsamic reduction on top of it all. The menu did not describe the dish properly never mentioning balsamic reduction nor did I ask- I simply went with what the menu said- the street corn had waaaay too many peppers in it basically making it so spicy I couldn't eat it. It was off putting especially combined with jalapeno grits underneath. The pork was the star and was delicious but it was difficult to eat with all the unnecessary stuff on the plate. This could have easily been avoided with a proper description on the menu. If I did ever go back I would order the fried chicken instead....",

    "text": "Went to Roaring Fork for the second time. We went for my husband's birthday and it was fantastic. Had Amy as our waitress and she was phenomenal. Very knowledgeable of the menu and the restaurant overall. Very sweet. We ordered the green chili pork as an appetizer which was delicious even though the bowl of bread rolls and cornbread would have been sufficient enough. Was delicious. Butter it came with tasted slightly like it was left open in the fridge but wasn't horrible. Ordered the New York strip with mashed potatoes and spinach as the side. Husband's only complaint was that it was slightly too charred on the outside but still delicious. I had the boneless buttermilk chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. Nice and crispy. For dessert we had the huckleberry cheesecake and the pecan pie. We also had the Texas mule and category 6 lemonade as drinks. They was very pleasant. Overall amazing experience and will keep coming back and recommending this place.",

    "text": "Those of you who've watched Check Please Arizona on Phoenix's local PBS Station (KAET-8), probably remember the show's original host Robert McGrath.  The soft talking food loving Texan ran the show for multiple seasons, inviting guests of all different backgrounds onto the show to share their favorite restaurants & love of food in general.  McGrath's rise to celebrity in the valley is well deserved, though perhaps largely unknown.  He's one of a select few valley chefs to have received the prestigious James Beard award (Nobuo Fukoda & Chris Bianco being the others).  Originally a chef in his native Texas, McGrath eventually made his way to the valley first as head chef at the Phoenician.  Then in 1997, he opened Roaring Fork.  It was his work here that earned McGrath his coveted Beard award in 2001.  McGrath has long since handed over the business, but I'd never set foot in this two decade old restaurant.  I have no way of knowing whether the restaurant or menu has stayed True to McGrath's formula now that new owners are in place, but for Arizona Restaurant Week it was as good an opportunity as any to find out just how good it was.  Roaring Fork can be found on the southwest corner of Scottsdale and Chaparral Roads.  You'll find the restaurant on the ground floor of the six story office building on that corner.  The interior of the restaurant is both rugged & elegant with a mix of high country touches like deer antler chandeliers & stone walls along with more formal white table cloths & beautiful cherry wood floors.  I arrived right after they opened for dinner at 4pm on a Tuesday & sat at the bar, expecting a fairly light crowd for the evening.  By 5pm, the place was jammed full of more than 100 people & there were about 10 waiting for a table in the lobby.  Not sure if this is the Restaurant Week crowd or a normal night, but whoa.  The Restaurant Week menu this go around offered up a three course meal & a non alcoholic drink for $44.  Based on the prices I saw on their everyday menu, Roaring Fork was most definitely offering up a discount versus their normal business hours.  I was offered a non-alcoholic drink, but instead opted for their happy hour house margarita.  The usual suspects with this one:  tequila, triple sec, & lime juice (I got mine on the rocks with salt).  Delicious, refreshing margarita & impressively strong.  I probably could've handled one more but after that I wouldn't have been able to drive.  I'd read all the buzz about their tortilla soup so I got that for my appetizer.  Here they give you a bowl with pulled rotisserie chicken, guacamole, & string tortilla chips & then the waiter pours in the broth using a second bowl.  Hands down the best tortilla soup I've ever had.  Admittedly I never thought to put avocado in my tortilla soup, but I'll be damn sure to do that from now on.  Though I doubt I could ever replicate the broth this soup uses.  Man, that was good.  The entree selection was tough as I was torn between a steak and duck.  As I can get a good steak almost anywhere, I took a gamble on their Sugar Cured Duck Breast entree.  The duck breast is cooked to a medium rare & sliced up for you on a bed of brussel sprouts, a sour cherry mustard glaze, & onion jam (which I honestly didn't know was a thing).  It also comes with a side of green chile macaroni & cheese with breadcrumbs.  I loved the mac & cheese & all the sauces that went with the duck were great.  Honestly though, I wasn't in love with the duck itself.  The meat was cooked fine & the sauces definitely flavored the meat well, but I just couldn't get into the texture of the duck.  I've had duck confit before which is byfar my favorite way to eat duck, so maybe I should just stick with that.  Lastly, dessert time & in this case that meant Pecan Pie.  Roaring Fork's Pecan Pie dessert is actually a chocolate & toffee pecan pie with whipped cream & a brown butter gelato on the side.  The gelato was perfect, the pecan pie was...okay.  Little Miss BBQ actually serves the best pecan pie I've ever had so Roaring Fork's effort to top that was going to be a tall order.  Roaring Fork's version was admirable, but a little on the dry side for me.  Total cost for the restaurant week menu, plus the drink, tax & tip came to about $65.  For context, the same items I got tonight would've set me back about $80.  Its an even better deal during Restaurant Week if you order their New York Delmonico or Filet Mignon steaks, which are discounted by almost 50%.  Overall though, a good meal.  Some parts were better than others, but I was pretty happy with my first run here.  Is it James Beard worthy?  No (at least not now that McGrath is no longer in the kitchen).  Certainly not when compared to Kevin Binkley, who's been a Beard runner up multiple times and is long overdue.  Still, there's a lot here Robert McGrath & his followers can still be proud of.  After all, you don't last more than two decades in the restaurant business by accident",

    "text": "The happy hour menu is legendary and so locals know that during the summer we've got unlimited hours of Sun & Mon to enjoy without waiting in line with the hoards of snowbirds.  The bar food menu has remained the same for over the last decade with the Big Ass Burger remaining front and center.  Whatever you may believe is the \"best\" burger in the Valley...you can't cast your vote until you taste the Big Ass.   French fries are likewise superior, evidencing some fine oil that bring them to a crispy brown that my wife dies for.   The flat-bread with chicken was a little heavy on the cheese...but who can really complain about that? The crust is perfect...a balance in between pizza and pie. The huckleberry margarita remains a classic, especially good if you like frozen which I normally don't choose but make an exception for this one. Service was decent if not spectacular, but another reason to show up when it is still 105 degrees outside at 9 PM and avoid the crowds.",

Our waitress Miss Shay seemed a bit apprehensive about our table. She was nice enough, but, she appeared somewhat \"fake\" for less than a better word. She was quite attentive to our table, and she answered our questions often time with a \"slight frown\" on her face.  Brian, our busboy came over and mumbled something to our table, however, we were engaged in conversation regarding our drink selection(s). We later asked Brian what he said when he came over to our table earlier to ensure we didn't miss something of importance, he seemed scared out of his wits...his hands started shaking and his face was flushed, he said, \"I was just asking if you needed more water/bread.\" We thanked him, and said \"oh no thanks, just wanted to make sure we answered your question.\"  I am not sure, if the Roaring Fork serves many African Americans, but, there is no need to fret when we come in, we are there for a good meal like our Caucasian counterparts.

Caught the end of happy hour, place was packed! Couple of cold beers to start.  Strange they only have bottles and cans, didn't see any taps, unless maybe I just missed them. Had a very good Caesar Salad to start, happy hour price. Watched several of their famous \"Big Ass\" Burgers go by. Insane Happy Hour value, but I'd consumed so much meat my prior to nights out, I decided on the Lake Trout, with shaved almonds and capers and a side of their outstanding green chili Mac n Cheese. The trout was huge, flaky and flavorful, best I've had in a while. And the Mac, well, what is there to say...freakin' awesome. A few glasses of pinot to top it off. Very nice night.  Next time in town, I'm having that burger!",

    "text": "So we walked over here from Postino (excellent place! ). The menu looked good, and I was anxious to try a couple things. We walked in to be greeted by two hostesses who were amazing! Good jokes, all smiles, directed us to the bar.   As soon as we sat down at the bar, we were greeted by a male bartender who had the face of someone who was just robbed of life. Tosses us some menus and wasn't really feeling it. No worries, everyone has a bad day. Female bartender comes over, and she's as cheery as a brush fire in a well-populated area. Was in a great mood, instantly put into the toilet. I've never been drained like that. Unfortunately will never get to try the food, one drink and done. Two stars for the awesome hostesses for their great personalities.",

Friday must be the night to go, as the crowd was active and vibrant.   The service, at first started off slow, became friendly and personable later on.  That's the only reason why I didn't give it a fifth star. Initially the bartender was standoffish and only improved when I brought it up.   But, I will return next week and try their signature BIG BURGER ! Which everyone says is to die for.",

They also had an amazing happy hour menu.  This place is kind of tucked away and is a little difficult to find at night.  That being said, it's surrounded by a couple of different restaurants so there is plenty of parking.   The interior of the building is quite nice.  This is definitely a good place for a lovely date night. Our waiter was also very accommodating and the rest of the staff was friendly as well. Although I can't speak about their food, they definitely have a nice and VERY long drink menu.  Our waiter made sure each of our drinks were strong.  I definitely plan on coming back here sometime soon!  I'll be sure to update my review then.",

I wouldn't have minded if our waiter made up for it in excellent service. Unfortunately he wasn't friendly, attentive, or patient at all. Each time he stopped by our table I felt rushed. He seemed annoyed when we asked questions and rushed through the specials. Even though it was mentioned to him that it was my birthday, we had to specifically ask about the dessert menu. I didn't end up ordering dessert because the vibe just wasn't comforting. The food we did order was quite good but it would have been a much better dining experience with better service.   This was our first dining experience at the Roaring Fork and some of our family drove all the way from Surprise, AZ to attend. It's a bummer that our dining experience wasn't very pleasant or inviting.",

At first we were ready to turn around and leave, BUT the Happy Hour pricing is only in a certain part of the restaurant. We did not understand this at first. Finally after a little patience on both parts, we understood each other and they were able to get us all seated within 20 minutes on a Sunday evening in December. Shae was our waitress and she was beyond incredible. She made our evening extra great! The food was delicious. Shae's recommendations of the Mussels and Chorizo and the 3 Cheese Dip with Chips was perfect for our table... She made sure we were taken care of throughout our meal and I give her personally 5 stars! Great service Shae! All except one of us LOVED our meals... The chicken plate tasted like Kentucky Fried Chicken, our guest was not overly happy with it. But it was delicious. Atmosphere was great, 70's music was great. We enjoyed. Thank you Roaring Fork!",

My iceberg BLT salad was good but my pork was way overcooked served at room temperature atop  cold grits. The corn side was fantastic. Had I not been at a work event this plate would have been returned to the chef.

And they got great prices! $5 glasses of wine and cocktails.  My boyfriend got the big burger for only $10 he said it was good but he likes other burgers from other places better. I Got the fish tacos, the fish was really tasty, but the tortillas were cold.that's the reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5. I got to say I loved our server; she was very nice and attentive.",

Roaring Fork was across the street so we walked over.   When we came in, it was five after ten and the waitress said no more food--kitchen's closed.  We were disappointed.  Then the manager came over and said they would seat us.  YES!!  We had a lovely waitron, Katherine who took especially good care of us.  We had a nice bottle of wine and began with the field greens salad with goat cheese and pecans.  It was wonderful.  The only part I didn't like was the beets (there weren't many) but I don't like beets.     I had a swordfish special which was divine.  It was late when we were done so we skipped dessert.  Someone had the pizza, which I didn't care for too much.    We are only here for a few days but we may come back, this place was great.  Ask for Katherine as your waitron--she rocks!!",

    "text": "Well what you know. The day after writing a review on Harvey's I got the burger itch. Luckily my good friend was down to meet up for a quick bite. My review is based only on the burger, haven't had anything else or been there before.  \"Big Ass Burger\" and yes it was. It's 4 hours later and I'm still full. Be ready to make room for this if you're planning on eating it by yourself. I'm guessing it's somewhere around 12oz of top grade sirloin with bacon and the usual fixings. I asked for mine on the side, as I've said before I prefer to taste just the meat, cheese, and bun when I eat burgers. I had a couple bites with the bacon and it was pretty good, didn't overpower it like bacon usually does, but still liked it just plain. Great flavor, great quality meat, cooked perfectly, and super juicy. I could have used a touch more cheddar, but it was ok. Fries were just right too, crispy extra battered style. Washed it down with a Fat Tire and I left a happy man.  If you can make it during happy hour, it's prob best way to go since the $9 price tag is much more manageable. I think it's $12-14 otherwise. Ambience was okay, similar to a Houston's, Bandera, etc vibe.  I will most definitely be back when the craving returns.  And yes...that's prob by next week.",

    "text": "Oh crap, I hate, hate writing mediocre reviews when everyone else writes great reviews. So I'm going positive first:  The service was GREAT! Well, the waitstaff. I'll start from the beginning: We just got back from Wet 'n Wild where I mentioned, if you read that review, I didn't bring a hairbrush much less took a shower.  We decided to visit Roaring Fork as it's on my husband's burger list and we rarely get this far north. So we drive down Scottsdale road and surprised to find it in an office building.   We walk in looking like crap with our messy boys and we are completely ignored by the two hostesses who are engaged in conversation with an older gentleman. So we walk around the restaurant and decide to go back to the hostess and see if we need to be seated. So I rudely interrupted their deep conversation and ask if they need to seat us. One of them said yes, if you are eating dinner or you can seat yourself if you want the happy hour in the bar or patio. We said we'll do the happy hour.  We went t to the patio which on this 108* day into evening was wonderful. The decor was so nice I wish my home patio looked so good and the misters were great even though by the end of the evening I was soaked. The waiter was very attentive and made a great beer suggestion. We ordered  the Big Ass Burgers for $9 and an order of Guacamole and the boys ordered mac & cheese.   The Guac was amazing, perfect with big chunks of avocado and onion, chip were fresh. The beer was served with chilled, small glasses - great presentation.   The burgers were HUGE, I didn't think for $9 you would really get a HUGE burger and Fries but you do. The burger looks great, super thick cooked to order with thick bacon, cheddar, tomato, poblano chile, nice lettuce, tons of pickles with an aioli on the side. What could be wrong?   Hmmm, I bite, chew, swallow, add aioli, bite, add salt. Just can not get any flavor from the meat.  This burger should be amazing. The bread is a really generic, white seeded bun so I get rid of it and used a fork and knife. Just no flavor so I both my husband and I only ate half of our burgers. The waitstaff seemed confused by our full plates but it just wasn't great and not worth the cholesterol or calories. The boys were happy with the mac & cheese and ate most of our fries. The guac and beer were great! And the service, except the host staff, was truly wonderful.    We would probably go back as we liked the ambiance and give it another try hopefully just an off night. Total for two beers, guacamole, mac & cheese x2, burgers x2 was only $45.",

The service was good, however I was told the specials and the aged 28 day steak sounded good. When it came out there was so much pepper rub on the steak, I couldnt taste the meat. The pepper rub was so overpowering  that I couldnt eat but two bites. I let the server know my feelings about the steak and he said no problem we can just box it up for you. What?!?.  So anyway he proceeded to take it away and box it up. The real surprise is when I got the bill $78 dollars just for the steak!!! Last time I take the special without finding out the price. It was not worth the $78 dollars. Anyway, I pay the bill and chock it up to a lessoned learned",

It was dinner and the waiter was awesome (I think his name was Paul).  We had the chili Mac & cheese and it was good (I am not a Mac & Cheese person - AT ALL).  I had the Salmon and tasted the pork tenderloin.  Both dishes were awesome.  The food is presented nicely.  One in our group had the fish tacos (which were actually shrimp that night).  he said they were awesome.  I want to try the Big Ass burger - maybe as a carb load before a run the next day.  The ambiance was perfect for conversation with business colleagues.  I will caveat that our dinner was at the same time as the BCS championship game.  The waiter even noted that the restaurant traffic was light.  We had a great time and I learned that there is a location in Austin in my neck of the woods.  Funny, I had to travel to learn of great spot in my own backyard.  I'm adding Roaring Fork to one of my favs!  Try it!",

    "text": "The decor is an odd mix of Arizona ranch and Colorado fishing lodge, with lots of hammered copper, rough-hewn wood shutters, barbwire-etched glass, and antler chandeliers. The cuisine can best be described as Southwestern comfort food with some very gourmet twists. The fondue is a shining example of the kitchen's creativity - a pot of silky-smooth, creamy-rich melted pepperjack cheese is accompanied by rosemary-garlic lamb chops, pistachio bread, and butternut squash for dipping. Other highlights are beef ribs braised in Dr. Pepper, pork shank slow-cooked in beer, and hickory-smoked salmon that tastes like it was grilled on a campfire. Green-chili macaroni and cheese is a house specialty, and deservedly one of the most popular items on the menu, as is the Big-Ass Burger piled high with toppings, but be forewarned - it's served only in the Saloon, which gets very rowdy, especially during happy hour. There's a patio with a fire pit that makes outdoor dining cozy on chilly evenings in the desert. Sadly, this isn't the five-star experience it should be - reservations appear to be meaningless, if the forty-five minute wait we had is any indication, service is abrupt and bordering on rude, and prices are considerably higher than they should be for what you get.",

If you order wine by the glass, they will bring it out in a mini-carafe, and you'll get more like 8 oz than the usual 5 oz or 6 oz, which turns into more like two glasses of wine.  I had a nice Opolo Vineyards Zinfandel that worked well with the appetizer and main course.  I started with the tortilla soup, which was fine but not very complex, and could have used something to brighten up the flavors.  The pork carnitas was the best food I had that night.  The portion size was incredibly large.  It could easily feed two.  The custard of the creme brulee was underwhelming somehow.  The service was good.",

    "text": "A couple friends and I decided to go out to dinner on New Years night, after our normal argumentative bickering trying to come up with a place to eat that would satisfy all 5 of us, we decided on a place down the street from our house called \"The Roaring Fork\". Seeing how none of us had ever been there before we were going in with our heads held high and our stomaches rumbling. We sat down and were instantaneously greeted by our server Bob. He went over the nightly specials with us and got our drink order, after quietly deciding our appetizer choice as well as our entrees we began to tell Bob, then the bad news set in, 3 of the people in our group were set on entree choices that they had ran out of for the night, with doubts they settled on choice number two. After 15 minutes our table was approached by what appeared to be the manager of the restaurant, later to find out was a corporate manager, with shame he explained to the 3 who chose option number two that they had also ran out of those menu items due to the fact that everything is made fresh on site and the evening was busier then expected. With extreme disappointment, they agreed to give the special (an 8 ounce filet) a try. The food came out rather quickly, they brought out salads to make up for the wait time, they brought out sides that they thought we would enjoy and when the main meal arrived, the 5 of us were fans. The food was excellent, and the service was even better. I eat out almost every night of the week, as someone with a rather busy schedule I find it easier to go out for dinner than spend time coming up with an alternative option. As we all know, it is extremely frustrating when we go to a restaurant and things go wrong, or our food isn't up to par, and we aren't compensated, or we don't get a table visit from a manager. Not only was our experience turned completely around, but our entire meal was taken care of. I can honestly say I am more then pleased with our visit, I would suggest this place to anyone looking for great food and service. I will return to The Roaring Fork as often as possible.",

    "text": "Got the RFmixed grill and the chicken was blood rare. Be sure to check your food because there not! The ribs taste and look like they have been parboiled seasoned and then tossed on the grill for a few minutes. The Elgin sausage was very fatty/greasy. Not worth $24! No way. My wife had the Carnitas. The pork was tough. It could have been cooked for a few hours longer. I smoke mine for 12-13 hours. This happens when places get too big. They start worrying about the quantity and the quality suffers. We did enjoy the Fried Avocado and Crab spicy crab remoulade and chives and the Rotisserie Chicken Flatbread roasted chiles and pepper jack. If you like the western dark atmosphere and I mean dark! They kept playing with the lights! I thought that I was having a stroke! Have a drink and some appetizers. Skip the entrees! We went to the Blue Adobe the day after and it was 10 times better and less than half the price.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner tonight because it was Arizona Restaurant week and they had a special menu.  They were offering an appetizer, entree, and dessert  for $29 a person.  Unlike other restaurants, the items on this special menu were some of the same on their regular menu and really represented an outstanding value.  We both had the Yucatan Shrimp Coctail.  One would have been enough to share but we each had eight very large, succulent, and very tasty shrimps.  I had the Mahi-Mahi Tacos, which were excellent and the other person with me, had the Dr. Pepper Shortribs, which were tasty but a bit too fatty and heavy. Dessert was pretty good but we could barely eat it since we were stuffed.    If there was one shortcoming, the food came out too quickly.  I noticed it was the same for all the other tables as well.  The appetizer came out right away and before I know it, the entree comes out. Slow it down!  It seemed like just a few minutes after we finished the entree, the desert came out. Needless to say, I felt the dining experience was too rushed.  Also, when we arrived, the dining room was virtually empty so I am not sure why they seated us and the 4 other groups of people who came in afterwards all in the back room.  It was a bit odd, being in this room full with other people and seeing the main dining area, which in my opinion was much nicer being empty.  The staff however were all very gracious and friendly and as the food was really very good, I would definitely return again.",

As you walk in the large stone hearth greets you with the sight of rotisserie chickens roasting away.  It's a signature item on the menu.  The bar seemed lively.  The cuisine is excellent.  Everything on the menu appealed to me, but I chose to start with the tortilla soup and the duck for my entree.  Both were wonderful.  Southwestern flavors were evident, but not overpowering.  I would have proceeded on to dessert but between my appetizer and entre (not to mention the excellent biscuits laced with bits of bacon and the sweet corn muffins) I was stuffed.  I'll definitely be back.",

Roaring Fork got #1 family rating of about 10 that we tried in a week's time. So much so that we returned - on time, 4PM - and there was a line waiting so they could grab a seat!. Best menu items - BIG BAD Hamburg - is exactly what it says HUGE!, loved fish tacos, never heard of pork wings (the shoulder) but they had a unique taste between pork and a chickenwing, soup nicely served with presentation, guacamole lacked some flavor but was clearly fresh avocados smashed! While the green chilles pork sampler was good, it was alittle spicey and really not my thing but had to try it since it was a signature dish. Refreshing cocktail options for $5.00 this place couldn't be beat. Quality of food amazing. Its nice that if this is a retirement community that these restaurants offer this happy hour to make fine dining experiences affordable. If this is year round - Pheonix may see me living here one day. Great time - great food",

    "text": "Just the other day I took my father to this restaurant for his 40th birthday. Just a few months prior he took me here to celebrate my own birthday and we had a phenomenal experience. Our waitress then was extremely personable and caring. She didn't overwhelm us and she frequently came by to make sure that our dining experience was worth while, so much so that we gave her a 35 dollar tip. However when I took my father there yesterday, we did not get the same experience with this waitress.  We were seated towards one of the back booths and sat there for about 20 to 30 minutes unattended. After some time, she came to our booth in a very disrespectful manner to which I even signalled over to my father about when it happened. She came by and eyed us to shut up rather than speaking to us like people and in doing so that was the only time that we spoke. She took our order and never came back. She had other waiters drop off bread and our food, and she was never back at our booth again.  What made it worse was the fact that when the food was dropped off to our table, our dirty plates from the bread and the butter was still there. Our dirty silverware was never replaced and our table had nothing but bread crumbs all over it. The woman who dropped off our meal apparently saw nothing wrong with any of it as she quickly dropped off our meal and left.  What I think is the most spiteful was the fact that our food was stone cold. I ordered the half chicken and the chicken itself was so dry that it was almost inedible and the string beans were hard, which leads me to believe that they left our food out for quite sometime. My father's fries were so cold that the ketchup was warmer and his burger had bacon all over it (which we adamantly told the waitress that he can't have any bacon due to religious beliefs). What made it worse was that my father had to flag down another waitress just to get our dirty plates and silverware away and he requested to have another waitress tend to our table. The manager came over and apologized to us but my father's birthday experience was ruined. This was supposed to be a big and meaningful birthday dinner but it was the exact opposite. To compound it our old waitress came back around to a table near us and loudly laughed and treated them with a greater amount of respect because she knew that we had raised a complaint towards her.  Its gotten to the point where I would feel more comfortable to not ever step my foot in this establishment again. That waitress fit the notion of the term \"Snottsdale\" and she led us to believe that she held a racial bias towards us because we were an African American family in a predominately white establishment, to which she treated everyone else around us like royalty. But our money was no different than anyone else's and my father deserved so much more than that. I worked many hours at my job while I was sick and not feeling well just so that I could save up enough money to treat him to a nice evening and this is the thanks that we get. Our meal was covered by the manager but our new waitress looked at us like we were complainers and treated us as such, but don't worry I am absolutely sure that we will not return again.",

Putting that aside, the server was great, and food outstanding. The Chicken Tortilla soup was great, as were the fish taco's.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

    "text": "Loving their during-the-summer-happy-hour-never-expires credo! Very nice.  I went here after work one evening and the place was packed (on a Wed or Thurs, maybe) w/HH/dinner crowds - always a good sign. Bar tables were occupied so I sat out on patio - don't worry, it was shaded w/misters around perimeter. Classy yet un-pretentious vibe that I sensed also.   Service was quick, friendly, and communication was ongoing throughout the evening - 5 stars there!   I tried their Huckleberry Marg - so delicious! Plus, loved their presentation - huckleberry (preserve?) at bottom layer, then frozen marg, then one huckleberry dollop on top center. Sorta reminded me of a nipple, but was refreshing nevertheless.  Since it was my 1x/week cheat-from-diet day, I ordered the kettle pork app w/flour tortillas. So dreamy! I had one, but then my internal guilt was screaming at me to refrain from 86-ing the rest, so I had the server sweep my goodness away. Booo!   Also ordered the Peach Arnold Palmer. It was just \"eh\" for me. Overkill of the peach flavoring and really sweet.  Almost felt like I was drinking a small bottle of Bath & Body Works peach lotion, but the alcohol in it helped it go down.",

    "text": "Went here the other night and the space is really fun with an open kitchen concept.  This was not the first time we have been here but the first time I have written a review.   We were seated outside and there was a private party going on.  They were doing a video and it was very loud.  Had they told us that was going on out on the patio we would have probably opted out of sitting out there.  The other thing about the patio and where we were sitting was there was no air movement so it was really hot out there and it was a cooler evening.  On to the food.  It is restaurant week and they have a 3 course prix fixe menu.  2 of us went with that.  I started with the spinach salad.  It had way to much dressing on it to the point where the spinach was soggy.  The soft boiled egg on it was incredible.  Really creamy- outstanding really.  I got the pork porterhouse.  It was just ok for me and pork is one of those things I tend to eat out a lot because it always taste better in a restaurant. I didn't think this hit the mark.  I finished with the coconut cream pie which was a complete disappointment.  The custard never set up and it was runny.  The best meal of the evening hands down was the pork tenderloin.  The grits with the corn was excellent.  The best dessert?  The root beer float.",

We arrived 30 minutes early and they seated us early (only waited 5 minutes).  When we got to our table there was an Anniversary card signed by all the staff and a rose on our table.  Sweet!  The waitress was very nice.  We ordered the Beef Ribs (which was amazing, falling off the bone) and the Salmon (so good).  We received a complementary dessert since our Anniversary.  The Huckleberry Cheesecake...MMM!!!  I highly recommend this place for a date!  Romantic and Intimate!",

    "text": "Roaring Fork is a solid restaurant.  First and most importantly, the food is overall quite good!  Definitely a meat-eaters restaurant - would avoid if you are a vegetarian.  We tried the queso con puerco as an appetizer.  Pretty good though not spectacular - basically melted cheese with a small portion of pork topping, which is a nice touch.  For entrees, the pork carnitas are fantastic.  Very tender and nice flavor.  Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin is also excellent - also perfectly cooked, tender, and the bacon... who doesn't like bacon!!  As a side, we tried the often mentioned green chili mac and cheese.  This was definitely good, though I do admit that I was slightly underwhelmed probably because of my overly high-expectations.  The macaroni itself was decent, though the crisp cheese topping was tasty.  Price is reasonable considering the pricey trend of Scottsdale restaurants.  Expect to pay high teens to mid-high 20s for entrees.  Service was great!  Other Yelpers described slow service, but this was not my experience.  Our waitress was prompt, friendly, and helpful, and we were frequently checked-on to confirm our meal was up to par.  No complaints.  Decor is nice.  We liked the ambience, and the kitchen can be entertaining to observe.  Would be a nice date place, since it's quaint and not overly loud.  Will be back!",

We thought going to an early dinner would be a good idea with a large party, but when we got to the restaurant we were told that the wait would be a couple hours for a party of our size....we were bummed and using the lobby area to yelp somewhere else to go. While there the manager (Matthew) came over to me and my sister saying that he overheard we had a large party and he might have a solution. He had a large table on the patio that was just wrapping up, in less than 10 minutes we were seated and being waited on by our lovely waitress Alex. Her service was top notch and non stop.... Then the food and drinks started flowing. We ordered the green Chile pots, guac, pork wings, tenderloin, fish tacos, big ass burger, iceberg BLT salad and chicken flatbread pizza. Everything was so delicious, seriously drool worthy. If i had to recommend one item it would be the pork wings, unique, flavorful, tender and crispy. Little flavor bombs! Our cocktails were delightful, delicious and refreshing.... Most refreshing of all was the unparalleled customer service we got from start to finish. We will definitely be back... Our dessert too was so amazing, the creme brulee and pecan pie. The pie was like nothing you've ever had before. Thank you Matthew and Alex for making my dad's birthday a year to remember.",

We found Roaring Fork through Yelp and while the reviews we read weren't 100% favorable, we thought most were very positive.  We were not disappointed at all.  A reservation was easy to make on short notice (even on a Friday night) probably since we were hoping to eat early, having skipped lunch.  On arrival our party of two was seated in a bar type booth directly across from the kitchen area.  Some diners might have thought that to not be the best location, as there was a ton of traffic of servers picking up orders but we enjoyed watching the activity and the kitchen preparations.  Better yet, we were greeted quickly by our server - Daryl - who took our drink requests and explained the special menu items for the night.  First, we enjoyed a marguerite and a glass of the house Chardonnay.  Both were good.  Our appetizer was the guacamole which was one of the best we've had, complimented by the lightest chips ever.  Main courses were (1) a mixed green salad with grilled salmon and (1) the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin served on a bed of corn grits.  Both were exceptional but the pork tenderloin is what will bring me back each time we visit Scottsdale.  It was simply fantastic.    I just hope we can visit this area again soon.",

    "text": "WOW ... where do I start?! It has been a little over a year since I ate at the Roaring Fork. I recalled the experience fondly and agreed to meet a group there for dinner. Place was crowded (as I recall) and we chose to sit at a high top bar table in the bar. Staff was amazingly attentive. We cruised through a couple of rounds of drinks and the three of us were about to settle on all of us ordering the house specialty ... fried chicken when the restaurant manager stopped by the table and had a nice chat with us. He succeeded in convincing of person in our party to order the rib eye that was the special of the day ... the person accepted the managers suggestion.  About 5 minutes later the waitress stopped by WITH the manager to inform our table the person that they had just run out of the rib eye, would he possibly be considered in anything else, perhaps the Filet at the special price? The person agreed to order the fried chicken and join the others.  We received a complimentary mac and cheese side to share and here is the astonishing part - what sets the Roaring Fork apart from some man others ...  We received the bill which was delivered by the manager to our table. He apologized again for the order mix up and welcomed us back. He informed us that make for the experience he had removed ALL of the drinks from the tab AS WELL as the cost of the meal for the person who was not able to have the rib eye ... REALLY!!  Most restaurants just give you the HO HUM sorry we are out ... pick something else. Customer service ... boy do they get it. I will be going out of my way to go back, recommend it wherever I can and share this story.  If you want to experience not just good food, a wonderful night out or a cozy venue - go to the Roaring Fork and get one of the best culinary experiences you can find in the valley.",

I think he was plotting his sinister moves on my entree while watching me wolf the bread basket and chef's free appetizer, his presence not required.  But then dinner arrived and it was showtime. He busted out.  Viciously attacking our Waldorf chicken salad, he literally left me breathless. I was like Michael Phelps, sipping what little amount of air I could gather between bites. It all happened so fast. The entire meal a blur.  Two Waldorf chicken salads and two waters came to forty-two bucks, fifty with the tip.  But to see that little bastard in action was well worth the price of admission, even though he did remain conspicuously silent throughout his little shit-show.
