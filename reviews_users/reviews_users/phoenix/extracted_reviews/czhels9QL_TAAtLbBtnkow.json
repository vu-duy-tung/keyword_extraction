    "text": "For those looking for a Packer bar in Scottsdale/Phoenix continue the search. We had the unfortunate experience of watching the NFC championship game at the district. The bar service was awful, the bartenders were more interested in trying to pick up girls and chat with friends than serve drinks and food. The game management was equally awful. The sound was not broadcasted on the sound system till game time and they cut it off all together in the third quarter. There are several other options like Casey Jones and Buffalo Chip in the area that are True Packer bars.",

So I walked in here this week , 2 guys working behind the bar ignored me completely, looked RIGHT at me and completely dismissed me. There was a total of FOUR customers in the whole place, so I sit down to wait for my friend, she shows up and we sit down at a table. Out pops a waitress, completely sweet and adorable! I tell her about the groupon and she got us started with our meal. She was helpful and quickly got us squared away. Within a reasonable amount of time she brings out 2 insanely delicious milk shakes, about 10 minutes later she brings out 2 really nice burgers and some nasty nasty nasty onion rings. Seriously these were like Burger King, small...chopped onions in them and funky breading. My friend and I laughed because there was a GREAT pub style onion ring on one of our burgers. I would try this place again, but I have to take one star away from because of the 2 that completely ignored me and one for  the NASTY frozen, gross onion rings.",

Very juicy, and was on a homemade Brioche bun that was soft and buttery.  The onion rings were awesome, beer battered and huge.  The Milkshakes were a delicious treat as well.  The burgers and sides are served on wooden cutting boards, nice stylish touch for a modern unique bar.  Definitely recommend coming here!

    "text": "I couldn't believe how this place was run.  A business partner of mine wanted to have a night on the town with bottle service in a reasonably casual venue, and I recommended The District.  What an embarrassment that was.  He booked the table about 4 or 5PM on Saturday, May 4th, for that night.  When I showed up around 10:30PM, he had already arrived and bought a bottle. At the door, I told the bald, white bouncer (who later refused to give me his name) the last name of my Partner who had the table that I, and my two female guests, were there to join (we were the first guests to arrive to join the table, aside from my Partner and his friend from out of town).  This bouncer confirmed the last name was on the table list, and then just stood there.  I asked what we were waiting for?  He said the person who had the table had to come to the front to retrieve us.  I asked if he was serious.. I couldn't believe he expected the client himself, who was there spending more than 15 GA patrons combined for the 'VIP' experience, to push through the crowd and come personally retrieve each of their guests, while the hostess (who's job is to host) stood by idle.  He didn't even offer to have the hostess or a waitress retrieve my partner, he said I should text him.  In disbelief, I complied, and as my Partner pushed through the crowd from the table to the front, I asked the bouncer if this was protocol for the District and if so, why this was?  He gave me a rude answer along the lines of \"Because I said so, that's how we do it here.\"  I used to work in a high end Old Town club.  I've lived here for nearly 5 years and Old Town has been my usual weekend spot from day 1.  I am no stranger to VIP bottle service from Scottsdale to LA to Vegas and beyond.  I have NEVER seen a table client treated like this.  Whatever, I let it go, I was there to have a good time.  About an hour later two more guests of ours arrived, one male one female.  They texted me asking us to come retrieve them in the same fashion.  Already feeling embarrassed by having recommended this place and having my partner treated like that, I personally pushed through the crowd to the front to get our guests in.  I walked outside where our guests were standing on the other side of the stanchion.  When the same bald white bouncer finished checking IDs for a group, I approached him and let him know those two were our guests for the same table.  He looked at me blankly in a patronizing tone said \"Oh ok!\"  And then he stood there, and again, did nothing.  I asked him why he wasn't letting them in?  He said \"The person who's table it is has to come retrieve them.\"  I couldn't believe it.  The stupidity had me at a loss.  My face must have been red with embarrassment when I pushed my way through the crowd back to the table a couple minutes later and told my partner, \"Hey man, they want you to go up there again.\"  He was irritated, and reluctantly went back to the front and got our guests in.  It was about 11:30 at this point.  And we had a large group on their way at this point.  We weren't going to be treated that way all night, so we closed our tab and went elsewhere.  On the way out, I asked the bald bouncer for his name, intending to report him to the GM. As a business owner myself, I thought, I would CERTAINLY want to know if an employee of mine was throwing basic manners to the wind and undermining my key revenue source.  He refused to give me his name.  I couldn't believe this whole experience, and I have to assume I am not the only one to have been treated this way, as none of the support staff working the door seemed to feel that anything unusual was occurring while witnessing all this.  Before leaving, I asked our waitress why they were acting like that?  She said \"Its so a bunch of people don't come in claiming they're with a table.\"  Okay - if that's the purpose, there are MUCH better solutions to that problem than abandoning the fundamentals of the VIP experience being consciously over-paid for, especially when there are six competitors within a 200 foot radius.    I feel embarrassed on behalf of the ownership and management.  What a senseless way to lose revenue.  If this was in fact a policy passed down from management, and not a rogue door-guy with ill-intentions for his employer, then what in the actual ?  Let's see... the more guests a table has: the more bottles of high-margin liquor they're going to have to buy... the more poppin your club looks = the more exclusive it feels... more exclusive = even more patrons buying drinks & higher prices... not to mention, the service you're selling is literally represented as VIP bottle service.  What kind of \"VIP\" wants to push through your GA crowd to retrieve their own guests?   Needless to say, after that offensive treatment and embarrassing personal experience, I will *never* again, under any circumstances, be recommending the District to any of my partners, associates, investors or friends.",

They have many menu options at a great price, especially on happy hour.  And, if you like shakes (which I know doesn't help our diets) but they're loaded with the extras (brownie bites in chocolate and Nilla wafers in the Vanilla).    I can't wait to go back for more!  Hopefully, the District enters into the Burger Battle during Culinary Festival - definite winner!",

    "text": "Be wary of this establishment.  I went to district yesterday and my friends credit card was lost by the bartender.   We kept the card open at the bar, but the bartender kept insisting that we took the credit card back.  The bill was never signed for or anything. We tried to talk to the bartenders about the situation, but they got an attitude and started throwing things around 'looking' for it.  Its not like we were wasted and being annoying drunks about the situation, we had one beer.   Finally, I asked the bartender if we could leave a phone number for when they found the credit card.   The bartender then says they are so busy that we should just call tomorrow and ask if they found the credit card after they deep clean that night.  To add to an already weird and sketchy situation, I am calling district and getting different voicemail names, I'm getting hung up on and no one has actually answered the phone.   So, I call over to Maya because they are connected.  The first man keeps me on hold for 20 minutes.  So, as I'm on hold, I say 'hello' and another man says hello back.  He then says he just got into work and had no idea that I was on hold and he would go look for the card.  Well, ten minutes go by and he just ends up hanging up. This is so ridiculous, it doesn't even seem real.  But, now I'm just convinced I'm being punk'd or this establishment is run by a bunch of thieves and con artists.  Or is just completely unorganized and no one knows how to use a phone.  I would definitely think twice about ever going here again, the service I have received has been extremely sketchy.",

While I maintain that a negative review does reflect a person's experience at a place of business, I was perhaps being a bit harsh on a place that is trying to fit in the scene. It may be unfair of me to voice my displeasure towards a place with no room, talking space, cheap drinks since all of Old Town Scottsdale is the same way.   I don't like Old Town, but I can manage a way to have fun with a little liquid courage at most places. My experiences at this place have not been fun. I believe that this place is great for others, just not for me. Much like how I love Calamari and others don't share that same affinity.   I will however improve my star rating of this place based solely on the fact that I had someone personally reach out and tell me how unfair I was being and I kinda agree for some reason. So I apologize for being a dick. Carry on District. Perhaps I will try you again sometime, but in the meantime, here's a neutral rating.",

We brought the kids (again) on a Sunday for lunch thinking it would not be very busy but there were already several tables full when we arrived.  By the time we left it was pretty busy and music was pumping.  We were seated just after a party of 16, my wife and I thought that would mean it would take a long time to get served but Holly was on it!  She acknowledged us as she was putting in the order for the big party then got our order in.  Despite the big group keeping her busy with multiple add on orders and drink refills she kept checking in with us.  The kitchen seemed un-phased by all the orders and the food came out much faster than we thought it would,  Once again, burgers done just right, sides very good and those great shakes.  The manager John even remembered us from our last visit a month ago, I guess being here with kids makes you stand out.  Once again he was conscientious and welcoming, he even turned the music down a bit for us and gave the kids a couple beach balls.  For a place that is really for adults they do a good job making sure we didn't feel out of place.  This place really shines, even in ways you don't expect.  I mean, it is a night-spot but the food is very good and the management and staff made sure we and our kids felt welcome.  A great surprise in old town!",

Twice now they have overcharged me on my bar tab, ie. a $34 tab which I signed and tipped $6 should equal $40, I was charged $51.  This was the second time, the first time I went to close my tab at the bar and the bartender said \"oh, we already closed your tab\" without me signing anything.  They gave me no receipt or anything for the amount.  I later see my credit card was charged $70, $30 and $5, none of which I was offered a receipt for.  I believe we spent around $50-$60, not $105.  I called the bar, no one has ever answered the phone, I also emailed from their website with no response.  I don't care about the money so I won't be fighting it (not worth my time) but if I ever go back here or to Maya, I will be paying with cash only.  Be careful as well, they will not let you in wearing a Bulls jersey while the Bulls are playing a playoff game on every tv in the bar....yet people with no shirt are welcome to roam freely.",

Then they took my friends ID for alcohol, the manager stared at it across the bar from us for a full five minutes, then sent the waitress back over to say they wouldn't serve her because it has the phrase \"not for federal identification.\" This is a technicality that is easily cleared up with a cursory Google search.   After that, the server gave up on us entirely. I'm assuming she had just written off any chance at a good tip, and chose to ignore us from there on out. It took half the evening to get water refills.   Additionally, the tv screens just cycled a screen saver of bikini clad women partying on a beach or something. We hadn't been looking for a strip club or Hooters. This is highly subjective, but the atmosphere of this place is profoundly douchey.  The food is okay, but not good enough to make up the aforementioned inadequacies. It's one of five identical bars on that street. I recommend trying one of the other four.",

I had the \"Walking in Memphis\" and this Tennessean gives it approval. Tender, juicy and even comes with a side of fresh fries which were also great. Security at this place was pleasant, instead of being rude, the bouncer was kind when letting me know that food had to stay inside and can't be brought to the pool. I would definitely return to this spot for a burger and a drink. Great service!",

    "text": "We arrived early hoping to beat the Saturday night crowd. No such luck as the District (and surrounding bars) were packed.   The drinks menu indicates some seasonal beers on draft, but good luck being able to ask your server. The noise level here is so bad that we resorted to communicating with the waitress by pointing on the menu and communicating with each other via texting. The beers arrived bottled, not on draft, and they were luke-warm.  I ordered the California Burger and it came piled high with fresh sliced avocado, grilled peppers, and grilled tomatoes. The fries were pretty good too. And that's all the good I can say about this entree. I shouted \"WELL-DONE\" when the waitress asked how I wanted my burger. It was pink in the middle. Good luck being able to communicate with the waitress if you aren't happy with your food. Otherwise the burger was flavorless and messy. The brioche bun was very chewy.  I had to get up and get us cutlery, condiments, and napkins off an empty table.  A security guard saw me and offered to bring some over, right after I had just gotten up. And that's another thing...security everywhere in here makes this an intimidating environment.  We had a guard stand over our table (usually with his back to us) the entire time we were here. I totally understand the need for security/bouncers in Old Town, but seriously, what did he think two guys at a patio table were going to do?   The men's bathroom was disgusting. The door was propped open so everyone in the bar could watch you do your business.  There were paper towels EVERYWHERE on the floor.   To cap the night off, a drunk lady threw a drink on me. In summary...loud atmosphere plus lackluster food and service. There are better options in Old Town.",

We went to the door and they said that they had no record of our reservation and if we wanted a table it would be $3500 minimum instead of the $700 that we booked.  Blatant liars and dishonest people working here.  Later that night the 30k millie joker of a GM finally admitted that we did have a reservation but still decided to rape us on the table.  Great way to ruin what should have been a fun weekend.  Book a table anywhere but here, Dakota, Bottled Blonde, Whiskey Row... this place knows how to hold you hostage and put a gun to your head when you have no other options... great way of conducting business... hopefully others will choose to spend their money elsewhere... I will never step foot in that trash ball venue again and I hope others will heed this review and do the same.",

I understand that it's an open area next to Maya but it was quite warm sitting at the bar. You'd think there would be a fan of some sort available to keep guests cool. I was sweating the whole time I was here. We came with a Groupon for 2 burgers, 2 shakes and a side. Our burgers were good but nothing memorable. The fries we ordered were so bland... It seemed like they sprinkled paprika on just for presentation and nothing else. There were exactly 11 people at the bar. My boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary when we first got here and when he finished it, it took quite a long time before he was asked if he would like another drink. The bartender walked by a few times without asking a thing. I had the bottomless mimosas for $15. Not too bad... It's kinda what every place in old town does. We are still waiting on our milkshakes. Asked for them for them to be taken to go and it's been at least 10 minutes. It's kind of awkward sitting here waiting for them after paying and all already. We'll see if those are any good. Honestly though, I don't think we'll be back. Nothing stands out and service was just okay. There are plenty of other joints in old town to try out.",

I was impressed by the food, overall, and consider it world class. As long as it stays the same over time it is a winner in my book. I am reviewing the food only, as the atmosphere is something else entirely. It is a club, and by virtue of that, it is bright and noisy (really noisy) and not really comfortable per se. The bartender that served me did a good job, but it was difficult to get his attention. But my review is about the food. Without going into detail, the burgers were really delicious, best I've had in a long time. Chef Ramsay would approve! Oh yes, the 3-7 happy hour deals are something to get excited about too! $5 burgers, $3 sides...yum!",

I thought it was just me because im old, but I could see others leaning into other peoples ears to talk and I find that to be a real big turn off. I had to repeat myself a few times for each of our orders and she had mention that she was going to ask if they could turn it down, but i didn't notice a difference. As we were leaving, we passed another family that was hesitating to come in, I assured them that the food was phenomenal, but forget the conversation. Just text each other. She laughed and agreed. It was too loud. Sorry, I hate complaining. so maybe try finding a middle ground??",

We went there with our three boys at around 2pm on a Friday. We ordered two cheeseburgers, two \"Harlem burgers\", ranch bacon French fries, cheese curds and 3 shakes...of which were one chocolate and 2 peanut butter flavor. The burgers were huge! Like 5-6 inches in height and 4 inches wide. They were juicy and delicious. Their cheese curds were out of this world! They are very similar to mozzarella sticks but the breading was more tempura like. The onion rings were crunchy and big with the onion part staying intact with the battered outer layer. The shakes were simply put evil because they were so tasty and perfect in the amount of thickness that you don't want to share.",

We both had a shake which was really good.  I checked in on Yelp's website and was able to use the offer of a one cent draft drink. I ordered an IPA which I normally don't like but it was an orange flavour and was pretty good!   The location was a little hard to find but once we got there we were curious about the pool outside.

I came here with some new friends for a bite to eat and a few adult beverages. They have a solid selection of local breweries and a creative cocktail list. I opted for the Camelback IPA to keep it local. For food I opted for the Fireman burger. It was topped with bacon, fire roasted poblanos, jalapenos, red bell peppers, arugula, red onion, habanero jack cheese, and District sauce, cooked to order. I ordered medium rare and each topping added to the taste and didn't all blend into each other. Don't order this burger if you're on a date as it could be pretty messy but definitely worth it. I also ordered the sweet potato tots and they were so good I had to take them with me much to the dismay of my fellow dining companions who thought it was weird!   Cheers!",

    "text": "On my 2nd trip to Scottsdale, I made my rounds bar hopping in the Entertainment District and can say officially that I've been to every bar there. Among all the bars in the area, I think that The District is my favorite. My experience this time around was so much better than last year's, and I wouldn't have wanted to cap our night at any other place. The bouncers were cool and didn't stand around like robot douchebags. The music was just as good as I remembered with a mix of Top 40, hip hop, EDM, trap, etc. For a Saturday night on a holiday weekend (Martin Luther King), the place didn't feel so claustrophobic with people. The bathrooms were clean and maintained pretty well through the night. I had such a great time partying here, and I look forward to coming here again on my next trip to Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Food-wise, 5-stars.  Service-wise, 5-stars...ish.  We tried two of their enormous burgers via a Groupon we purchased, which also included a side and two shakes. Both the Fireman burger & Californication were very tasty & filling. The side of sweet potato tots were good, as were the Chocolate Cherry and Very Berry shakes.  I like the setting. Very 'Murican, with a touch of classic American pop culture, and pretty similar in layout to the other restaurant bars lining this street. Our server was nice and bubbly too.  The only real complaint I had is that with the overabundance of food that comes in this packaged deal, we really didn't need two shakes. So we asked if we could substitute one of the shakes for a beer, which is actually $2 less on the menu, thinking it'd be an obvious \"yes\", and our server returned to inform us that regrettably the manager said, \"no\". That part turned what would've been a 5-star experience into a solid 4... I can understand if we were asking to sub for an item that actually costs more, but we were doing the opposite, and we ended up having to toss half of the shakes because it's just too much to put down in one seating.",

Couldn't really figure out where the dance floor was situated. It's a nice venue, broken up into two spaces with two separate bars. The DJ was on point here really loved the music. It is located right next to Maya night club. It wasn't crowded while we were there but I am sure it got packed later in the evening. We went to another club but I wouldn't mind staying here to party. The drinks were good and the music was excellent. The girls had fun and it's very open. It was pretty hot inside but we found seats under the AC which helped.  Overall we enjoyed our time here and we wouldn't mind coming back here to party next time we are in town. It was a great experience.",

I asked to speak with a manager and Pete came to speak with me (after my third time asking for a manager). Pete said he'd give me my money back if I wanted and I said I'd appreciate $11 back for the food. He brought me the $11 and he took the food back that went in the box. Very unprofessional and rude. A few of the employees are great who work at the bar and the security crew is always great but the management needs quite a bit of improvement. They really should invest money in training and management. ----------------------  Hi Erik! It won't let me reply to your message. I didn't receive Pete's business card. He was the manager who came to speak with me. I appreciate you acknowledging my review. Thank you.",

    "text": "I had a horrific experience with the bald angry man at the front door last weekend. I was with a large group of girls for a bachelorette party. District was our last stop of the night. We politely waited in line, didn't ask for any favors, and the doorman approached us, ushered us in through the line, and gave us a table with a bottle of champagne. Incredibly kind right? Turns out that was leveraged against us at a later point.   We had one guy friend as a part of our 12 party group of girls that had been the ultimate gentleman in chaperoning us through Scottsdale. He arrived at District a mere minutes after our group of girls. He too, politely waited in line and when approached the front was quickly rebuffed. I found this surprising considering it was dead inside, a rainy night, and there was no harm in letting him in. I went outside and politely asked the bald guy if he could consider letting our friend as he is a part of our group. I was shocked when he sneered with complete disdain that unless my friend was to pay him off, it wasn't going to happen. Great business practice right?   Then, when I thought he couldn't be more repulsive, he then in the most condescending and vile tone said \"you're making me regret taking SUCH GOOD CARE OF YOU\". Excuse me sir. Although we were there for a bachelorette party and you may make general assumptions about those groups, this particular group consisted of 6 lawyers, a hedge fund manager, 3 medical professionals, and 2 business owners. We are more than capable of buying our own bottle (and I assure you it would have been much nicer than the cheap shit sent to the table) and we were planning on tipping 4x what the bottle was worth as a thank you. But instead he seemed to think that was leverage to tolerate his verbal attacks. He went even further after my friend asked for the manager and threatened to call the cops. Pathetic.   It's a shame bc on the interior of the bar the staff was kind and the vibe was fun. But I refuse to give business to anyone that has that misogynistic, condescending, vile man representing them. Ladies, unless you want to be verbally assaulted by a man suffering extreme Napoleon complex, avoid this place at all costs.",

Both are delicious and every thing you want from a good burger, flavorful, cooked to perfection, real Angus beef, quality ingredients, home made sauces, served hot and fresh! We normally get the hand down favorite sweet potato tots (best in the west) or the tasty basket of fries but decided to try the onion rings today. They were yummy but defiantly the tots take the crown in our opinion. Not to mention the shakes! The district mud is a must try, a real premium shake with actual chunks of brownie and Oreo goodness. However it's also important to have good serves which today like always we did! Sierra the bartender killed it today! Not only could we tell that she knew what she was doing with her fast and flawless serves she also was very welcoming and friendly! Everyone who works there is always very bubbly and nice! Love the vibe of this place! It's lively, clean, fun, and modern.",

My friend and I spot two beautiful women dancing across the street on top of the bar at The District and we immediately asked ourselves what we were doing here. We convinced the girls to head over-best decision ever!  Wait was a little long to get in, but well worth it. I felt like we were in Vegas when we walked in-the women dancing on the bar were wearing practically nothing and my girlfriend asked me for $1 to stick in her G-String. Are you kidding me? How could I not give this place 5 stars! Music was great, everyone was dancing, and it didn't take long to get drinks. Bartender was having fun too-he would pass our beers between the legs of the dancers on the bar with a shit eating grin on his face the entire time.   All in all a great spot to party! We will definitely be coming back here next year!",

One of the bartenders was the manager.   We waited for drinks while the manager was texting and one of the bartenders was dancing.   The bar was not busy, and we had to wait for drinks.   My friend and I complained to the manager.  His response was that they were short-staffed and if we sat at the bar, we would've received faster service.  Then we were told if we had ordered food, we would've received faster service.   All f'ing nonsense! I was told we could leave if we weren't getting proper service.  I was willing to stay if i didn't here that a few times.  We had already been waiting for food and drinks.   The 'manager'tried to blame our server for the poor service.   All B.S!  Long story short,  we were basically asked to leave if we didn't like the service.  I asked to be comped, and we were told to leave again.   I had some curse words with the incompetent manager and bartender ( C U Next Tuesday) and walked out.  WORST SERVICE EVER IN MY LIFE!!! Came to El Hefe and my party was treated like royalty.   AVOID THE DISTRICT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!  ZERO stars in my mind.  I start my tip at 40% and it goes down from there.  Shay at El Hefe is has earned 50%,and Mike, the manager has earned my business!",

Finally a server comes over were we order our two burgers, one side, and our two shakes. After about 20 mins a guy comes over and literally sort of throws our food down and runs away before we can get one word off. Needless to say we now have no silverware and need some more water. So we wait patiently for no joke another 15 mins when finally my boyfriend walks over and asks the bartender if he has any silverware and if the burger \"the jungle\" is suppose to not have a bun. He seemed confused as to why the kitchen made it without a bun. Needless to say the burger had no bun. He was nice enough to give us some silverware and brought us out a bun for his burger. After that ordeal we ask him were our onion rings were and shakes. No joke another 15 mins later after we had already finished our burgers the onion rings are brought out. And of course the person that brought them did not say one word. Or ask us how we were doing. Once again someone not part of the wait staff a security guard asks if we are okay. I then politely asked for some more water. Finally after another 15 mins a girl comes over and we ask if we can please get our shakes and the check. another 15 mins later are shakes finally come. But we are once again waiting for the check... Overall our lunch lasted over 2 hours and at this point all we wanted to do was LEAVE!!! Finally we got the check and we were able to leave. I would never recommend this place! I have never ever ever ever seen such horrible service!!!! I know it is more of a club vibe but still this was just ridiculous!",

    "text": "Today I tried The District for lunch. I had a pretty good experience. My boyfriend and I arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon to a completely empty restaurant. We approached the bar on the left side where the only employee was standing and told her that we were dining in. She instructed us to sit where ever we like and someone would be over. It was a very lax atmosphere. Our waitress however was very upbeat and friendly. We ordered the mudslide shakes, onion rings, my kind of town burger, and walking in memphis burger. The shakes were awesome, overindulgent and thick. The onion rings were okay, but a good sauce would have improved them quite a bit. I would recommend ordering something to go with them since it isn't provided. The my kind of town burger fell a little flat of expectations; it was a bit flavorless. I only tried a bite of the memphis burger.. it advertised a spicy BBQ sauce but instead was more sweet. Luckily there is a roll of paper towels left on the table as we needed quite a few. I enjoyed the bars decor and the numerous Tvs they had. The District seemed it would fill up at night, but business was incredibly slow for the lunch crowd.",

The music is always awesome and appealing to every taste. You can eat, play, dance, chill and party all in one location.   Wait, did I mention the burgers?   I wish i could give this place 6 stars.

This is a fact and not an opinion, I am from Chicago which has some of the best food and restaurants in the world and Arizona which I love with all my heart cannot hold a candle to the food in Chicago.  However this place without any doubt does, their burgers are absolutely amazing, just order them medium rare and don't be a pussy, they are using incredibly high quality meat and it is cooked to perfection, do not ruin it. Also, the Harlem Shake is amazing. You are not going there for 5 star service, you are in Old Town Scottsdale at a sports bar, think about it, but the food is amazing and just enjoy it.",

    "text": "This review is for the groupon and food.  I think the groupon is deceiving.  This is only a savings if you go after happy hour.  ALL burgers are $5 from 4-7.  The menu reads all burgers come with fries.....unless you use a groupon as your waitress points out, then your burgers come with one shared side for an additional $5.  So during regular dinner hours your 2 burgers come out to $10, since you aren't given the fries that accompany the burgers the charge is $5 and 2 shakes for $14.  The grand total is $29 so your groupon saves you a total of $9, which isn't close to 50%.  Since they charge you tax, I can't help but think that is why they increase the price by $5 with a side that comes included with burgers if you didn't have a groupon.  The bread was stale, the red peppers soggy and cold out of a jar and the Jungle had so much garlic I can't taste anything else an hour later.  My boyfriend order firehouse burger which supposedly had bacon...one strip.  He ordered without red onions and you guessed it onion.  The burger was a soggy mess but had quality meat.  The shakes were good but don't love up to their $7 price tag.  The waitress said everything on the menu was her favorite. We won't be back unless I need protection from vampires.",

(There was literally only 1 other table seated in the place, so it wasn't busy.) We mentioned to our server that it was 97 degrees outside so with their doors open and absolutely zero a/c or even a fan blowing, it was extremely uncomfortable. He just chuckled and agreed that it's hot today!  The burgers were huge. The buns were a little stale and hard, but the toppings were good. Our sides/apps (onion rings, cheese curds, skin-on fries, and sweet potato tots) were good--typical bar food. Our shakes were 1/3 whipped cream on top.  If I didn't have the Groupon which made this an incredible deal, I wouldn't go back and pay the menu price for what we got.",

We both agreed the burgers, fries, and shakes looked better than they tasted.  Service was fine.  Our server was definitely busy, but very sweet.  Like a lot of other places around town, they offer Bottomless Mimosas on the weekend, but cap it at 5 for $15.  Not a bad deal at all.    Overall, I would recommend this as a Happy Hour spot for when bar-hopping around Old Town, or to grab a quick bite before heading into Maya, which it's connected to.  ENJOY!",

Many of the restaurants I've visited advertise 'voted best burger' only to turn out to be flavorless or dry necessitating drowning it in ketchup to make it palatable.  Many places can get it right once but I don't consider a place 'great' unless it can produce the same quality on a consistent basis.  I have been to the district 3 times and each time I order the same thing and it has been excellent.  The burger is full of flavor and the bun is fresh. If you are looking for a great burger in the Phoenix area, there is no other place to go.  I put the districts burger in my top 10 best for burgers anywhere in the world.",

I would recommend this place and go back in the future. It was a very pleasant and chill experience.",

    "text": "I like this place a lot. I've only been here during happy hour for the $5 burgers, $4 shakes and $3 sides. Crazy. Not what you would expect in Scottsdale but the food is really good. The burgers are cooked to order which they do an o.k. job at. I would order the burger one level rarer than you normally do just in case they over cook it which they've done consistently. No big deal really because just about every place over cooks burgers. (not sure why grill cooks like hockey pucks but whatever). The burgers are huge, stacked with whatever options the particular burger comes with. Juicy, messy and tasty. The way a good burger should be. The sides are also good and $3 for the stack of onion rings is fair. There are 2 different Milkshakes and both are quite tasty. If you're in this area and it's happy hour time, check it out.",

Here of course.    DO NOT go here if you are looking for a relaxing and quiet lunch or dinner.  If you bring kids near this place you might be a kid still yourself.  This is a place for EDM goodness and loud DJ's.  PS: forget about ordering food here unless you are too wasted to walk but just ok not to be kicked out.  Takes forever and they most likely will send your food to the other side of the bar.  However, if you do get the food, Congrats!   You have managed to not pass out before your food gets to you!  The burgers here  are very tasty especially if you have been basking in the sun all day at Maya's pool!",

I went here thinking it would be a lowkey night with a sports bar atmosphere but i was pleasantly surprised.  The place quickly filled up and the crowd proceeded to get turnt to the level of bottled blonde or hi-fi.   You can get bottle service at one of their tables or do the scottsdale 30,000 dollar millionaire thing and settle for their $5 domestic drafts all night.  This place passes the test for a fun night out with friends. The plethora of tvs they have also make it somewhere for you to watch sports all day long, especially with their $15 bottomless mimosas on saturday and sunday.   Very excited about this place, looking forward to many more good experiences here.",

I called out to the bouncer if we could duck under and it seemed to me that he indicated yes. As I did that, another bouncer essentially clocked me, pushing me back and yelling at me that I wasn't allowed to do that. I was really humiliated and it hurt. I'm a 30-year-old mother of a toddler, and it was the first bar we had gone to, so it's not like I fit the profile as someone trying to cause trouble or buck the system.  When we got in, after being manhandled, the bar was fine. It was very crowded, loud and smoky (from smoke machines, not cigarettes) but that's what you want from a bachelorette party in downtown Scottsdale, right? The drinks were good.",

Take note, service was good, food was good but it is mainly a night clubby/bar atmosphere.  The first time we went w/ the groupon for 2.  This time, we used the groupon for 4 and went w/ our son, daughter and the 2 younger grandkids.  It's very loud-yet I would never suggest going w/ a crowd b/c they don't have tables for more than about 6 (if you squeeze).  It is more of a bar, late night place/area.  So if you want to go for a family burger night, either go very early or go someplace else.",
