Ordered the Marsala and Lasagna factory plate.  Two main dishes on a huge plate. No sides. Just a huge bread.  It was actually enough for me and my bf  to split between the two of us  All in all it was pretty charming.",

I was impressed that we mentioned gluten free and the waiter gave me some options, he even remembered no croutons on my salad and the item I ordered had a gluten item on it so they substituted something else in it's place.    The food was good and I have to say the pasta was really good because I've made my own and well this was a LOT better.  It was the perfect consistency I just wasn't impressed with one of the toppings because it made the dish very dry.  I ordered the Pot Pourri forgetting that the clam sauce would have gluten in it and substituted with the browned butter and Mizithra cheese which was really dry to me.  The Marinara sauce was good and added some flavor to the dish which I thought it was missing with the other item.    This is a great family restaurant and the staff is really nice and friendly.  For the price of the food and the service you really can't beat it.",

    "text": "New look, same old game. I have to start by saying that the exterior remodel is gorgeous!!! So total kudos for that. Unfortunately, that's were the excitement ended. The last time I recall eating at the Old Spaghetti Factory was at the Tempe location in elementary school. As an adult, the bells and whistles of the decor fall flat quickly. This restaurant is cute for sure, but attention to cleanliness has not been paid. Even after a huge remodel! There were dead bugs in the busted out faux stained glass in our booth. Their price point is very good, so I didn't expect the world for a three course meal, but it was sad, sad, sad. Salad consisted of iceberg and croutons, nothing else. The \"fresh baked\" bread was hard and had an aroma that I can only equate to bleach. The pasta with meat sauce was poorly plated, just slopped on. It was completely edible, but I could have made better at home with a jar of sauce and some extra veggies. Having some ice cream or spumoni included in the meal was nice. It tasted like something from the grocery store, but at least it existed.  I don't want to hate this restaurant. It is an AZ staple. The food is passable and the service is good. I had just hoped for more seeing the nice, new facade. I will not return nor would I encourage others to do so. The Old Spaghetti Factory maybe has an inch over Olive Garden in the presentation of the restaurant, but would be a downgrade on food quality. And that comparison is sad on all fronts.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  The Old Spaghetti Factory is my alltime favorite restaurant in the whole world, and has been since I was 3!  This is ALL because of their spaghetti with mizithra cheese....My mouth is watering right now just thinking about this dish.  With it's rediculously flavorful shredded goat and sheeps cheese (mizithra), and the warm brown butter and garlic sauce, this meal is decadent - but without the pricetag!  For $16 I can get this entree, with salad to start (their homemade ranch dressing is to die for), warm bread with garlic butter, dessert (spimoni or sherbert), AND a glass of wine.  The decor is also amazing - so unique and eclectic, it's got a really fun ambience - complete with dining trolley in the center of the room!  There are private rooms for even small dinner parties (I had a private room for a dinner of 4 once, and it was simply luck of the draw).    The old arcade games (think pacman) in the lobby waiting room are entertaining as well.  Basically, if I were on death row, this would be my choice for a last meal.  I have no idea how anything else tastes here, because I always order the same thing, and I always leave completely, happily, satisfied.",

    "text": "This should have been a better experience...   I'll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.  Then the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \"lunch menu\" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he'll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \"Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn't press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.    What could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \"that doesn't apply\" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars.",

The food has never been the best I've had and the quality seems to have diminished over the years but I'm still a fan, nonetheless, and would give them a solid 3.5 (had to round it up to 4 due to yelp's lack of half scores).  During my college years, me and my partners in crime would eat at OSF at least once a month. leave fully satisfied with leftovers all under $20 for us three.  Obviously, the price has changed over the years, but it is still very affordable and satisfying.   All of their entrees (priced between $10-13) come with a drink (coffee, tea or milk), unlimited fresh baked bread (accompanied by regular and garlic butter), choice of soup or salad AND a scoop of spumoni ice cream.  Perfect for those on a budget!  The portion sizes have decreased over the years, but that is actually a good thing.    My fav is the Spinach Tortellini with Alfredo sauce with a side of Mizithra cheese... yum!  Unfortunately, they no longer offer fresh pepper at table side.  Really?  How expensive can that be fo provide?  This discounted practice really chops my hide!  My college gf came to town and for nostalgia wanted to eat at OSF.  We met a couple of friends there.  Everyone enjoyed their meals (spinach tortellini, garlic mizithra and crab ravioli).  We also enjoyed the garlic cheese bread appetizer.     The OSF is definitely a great place for individuals or families on a budget.  The train car in the restaurant is always a hit with the kiddies.  Definitely, not real Italian food but I love it!",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of spending my Friendaversary with the lovely Georgie S. this past Sunday at the Opera. Because we saw \"La Boheme\" I felt it only right to get Italian food, so we headed over to The Old Spaghetti Factory in hopes of satisfying our pasta craving.  It was quite charming when our waiter came over with the bottle of wine that we ordered. It was the second most pricey bottle they sold (coming in at $34) and he told us in the four years he worked there he had never sold a bottle that expensive. Well, that's because you don't have high class broads like us patronizing this establishment, or so it would seem!  They have a good sized menu with a lot of delicious looking dishes. I was especially excited that they have gluten-free pasta! I was hoping I would be able to eat more than a salad. On that note, I must point out that your meal comes with salad, bread, your entree, and iced tea, AND spumoni for dessert! If you choose not to get the tea and dessert, you get to knock $1.50 off the cost of your meal.   That means that my large, tasty plate of pasta and the salad cost me $6.50.That's right folks, dinner for $6.50!  The place itself is pretty charming. They have a trolley car in the middle you can sit in. The one drawback is that this place is very \"family\" oriented; something Miss G and I are not normally very \"fond\" of. But we dealt.   Very solid 4 stars....",

    "text": "The Old Spaghetti Factory is a fun chain restaurant where both families and larger, alcohol-fueled gatherings are at home.  I come from an area where \"red Italian\" menu items are commonplace, and mediocrity is the norm.  From this perspective, the cooking here is comforting and old-school; a notch above the ordinary, but nothing to get excited about.  Fortunately, portions are very generous, prices are quite reasonable and The Old Spaghetti Factory scores on that basis.  The lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance.  Not enough mozzarella was buried under a thick coat of ho-hum tomato sauce.  Several other cheeses were (literally) throw-in's, the dish would improve with their removal or replacement with adequate quantities of garlic, basil, oregeno and/or onion.  Seasoning, in general, appears to be oriented toward their pre-school and geriatric patrons.  My coworker had the crab raviolli; it looked delicious, but a bit light on crab.  She did enjoy it.  While David was a capable and friendly waiter, the kitchen let him (and us) down.  Our appetizers and entrees were brought to the table within a minute of each other; completely unacceptable, and cause for the loss of one star.",

This is definitely \"family food.\" Most adults won't complain about it, and kids will enjoy the simplicity. I recently had the Old Spaghetti Factory's Chicken Parm. I won't call it bland, but it's nothing that the average home chef couldn't cook up for their family.   I will give the place credit for the portions. It's not expensive and you get a lot of food. While the chicken itself was not huge, it comes with Spaghetti, an entire loaf of bread and butter, and a side salad. The salad was way too plain for my taste, but at least I had a little bit of vegetables to go with my meal. It's also quick. Take out orders are almost always said to be ready within 10 to 15 minutes.",

The seating area at the bar is a great place to wait for your table (yes, you will wait, because this is one of the best Italian restaurants in Phoenix). Old barber chairs are arranged in the middle of the bar area, perfect for conversation and a bit of fun.

    "text": "Old spaghetti factory: 6/18 So this being my first review for the blog, I wanted to be a little detailed and more intuitive to my review.  First things to note, this is my first time here, we were with a party of 10-12 people, and it was a family birthday and that may have been what happened with service or the overall experience.   Let me start with the experience, walking into the restaurant was quite plesant, and seating wasn't bad for a get together, the warm home style atmosphere was pleasing and made for great conversation space with out interruption from to much music or background. So overall the space was great.  Let's look at the menu. Lots to choose from here, there were a few of us in the party so we did get to see a nice portion of how the plates were. I did enjoy the selection, and how most of the dishes came with the option for soup/salad, and the spomoni. It was nice to see that I didn't have to pay extra for a Dessert.  After looking over the menu I settled on the Number 3 Factory Meals: The meat lovers plate, and also ordered a garlic, pepperoni, and bacon bread. I usually order appetizers when with family as a conversation dish to eat and chat. After placing my order we waited for the courses to come out.  It was about this time I emptied my drink. Let's see how service is..  The appetizer came out along side the Soup and sides. The appetizer was quite delucious I sprang for the extra toppings of bacon and pepperoni, which was a great choice, a nice smokey flavor on the bacon and not too greasy on the pepperoni. The best part was the sauce, that you spoon onto the top, it was like a warm brushetta with alot of flavor.  The soup, was a house ministorone, I found myself confused at what I was eating, even to the point of googling ministorone soup, to remember if there was suppose to be noodles in it. Sadly I even tipped over the cup onto my plate I search of pasta and all I found was a noodle less pile of stew veggies, as you can see in my picture.  Finally, the main course... The Meat lovers pasta.. I was impressed by the amount of food, but the service wwas terrible, I had asked for grated cheese and waited 5-8 mins for it to arrive. Almost like they took a detour. Finally with my food cheesed I dove into the meatballs.. This would soon to be disappointing.. The meatball was flavor less, only to be described as a round beef patty.. The Italian sausage was even worse, it tastes frozen and lacking any sort of Italian flavor.. After cutting up my meatballs and sausage and adding it to the sauce, I found covering it in cheese to make it edible with a bit of flavor.  Dessert- this was a nice surprise that it was included in the meal, but to tell you it was delicious  I would be exaggerating. The spomoni ice cream reminded me of egg nog, and worse of all after eating all that heavy food it just added to the mound of food in my stomach making me feel a little lethargic.   I would rate the old spaghetti factory 2/5 stars, between the customer service, the food, everything.. I would go back and see if having less people makes a a better experience...",

    "text": "It had been a while since I had eaten here. I used to bring my staff here for post team building meals, until the light rail traffic just made it horrendous to take a bunch of people onto downtown traffic.  My wife and I decided that we wanted a change; therefore, she suggested that we pay this place a visit.  We were quite impressed with the remodeling efforts as it really opened up the lobby, and brought a more modern touch to the place. It was a Friday evening, and there was certainly a large crowd and the wait was about a 45 minutes. We didn't mind it much as we were in no hurry, and we had already committed to sampling their dishes.  She chose the rich meat sauce pasta classic, and I had the sicilian meatballs.  The pasta was superb. Not overly watery. Just right, and we didn't need to douse it in sauce to enjoy its flavor. However, the meatballs in my meal were overcooked, and lacked any of the tasty characteristics I used to remember from this place.  What really downgraded our mediocre opinion was the service. Either the place was too busy, and they didn't have enough staff, or the waitress serving us was taking long breaks in between her table rotation visits. In either case, we sat there for long periods of time with nary a refill, and it took forever for her to return once we were done with our meals. Then she brought in the signature spumoni for dessert, and it was already partially melted.  Then to top it all off, which set off my wife, is that she asked if we were together or if we wanted separate checks? Improper etiquette right there. I realize that many couples now split checks, but perhaps rephrasing the question would've been more proper. Just my opinion.  Needless to say, we will not be returning. Even though the pasta was superb, we have too many options in many parts of the valley to have to frequent this place, and have to settle for a re-peat of dreadful service.",

I called twice in advance to confirm reservations and head count to ensure a smooth process for all when we arrived. Reservations were at 7:15 but we didn't get seated until 7:40ish.   Once seated our server was extremely slow, now to be fair we had a group of 19/20. I politely asked the manager if there was any way we could get another server and I was told they only have multiple servers for parties of 25+.   We finally got the appetizers and realized that plates had never been put on the table. Once the actual entrees were ordered the food was bland and average (I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli)   The aesthetics and restaurant itself was nice and had a cool ambiance of an old house. I did however notice that the baby changing station in the men's room was filthy. Looked like it hadn't been wiped down in months.   I was not impressed and will never be back.",

    "text": "What makes a persons first time at an iconic old time restaurant be so bad that they come home and immediately go to Yelp?  Have a long wait time in a restaurant that is 1/2 empty... check.  Seat the party at the table closest to the entrance and exit when there is plenty of tables in the dinning room... check.  Take over 20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge that they are there... check.  Serve salads before even putting the drinks on the table... check.  Never come back again once the food has been served and have your customers wishing they went to crappy Olive Garden instead... Check.    I was excited to try this place since others seem to really enjoy it.  It's eclectic and old school Phoenix feel in the Roosevelt district IS charming.   The smell of old wood on a day it's been raining has its own unique old house feel and I was hoping for a good experience when I saw the comfy chairs and arcade machines.    I wasn't put off by a 20 minute wait, although the restaurant did seem a bit empty.  But when we were sat at a table closest to the entrance and no one was around I did feel out of sorts and took a peek around.  The tables are set up so each table for the most part (except those in the trolley car) has its own private feel so being sat where everyone comes and goes was a little weird.  Still no big deal and we sat and chatted, looked over the menu, chatted some more and then realized that we still haven't see  our waiter and it has been 20+ minutes since we sat down.  We flagged the host who found our server and we waited another 5+ minutes.  Weird when there were so many servers walking by us and it seemed like a fairly slow night.  We considered walking out then.  I wish we had.  When the waiter did show, no apologies for the wait.  We ordered everything all at once because, well, we had plenty of time to make our decisions.  A long wait again and we were served bread and salads.  Then finally our drinks came after we started eating our salads and mentioned to the waiter that we still didn't have our drinks.  The food came before our salads were done and the waiter was quick to take the plates (even though one person hadn't fully finished her salad and only put it to the side when her dinner plate came.). My dinner plate was saturated in butter.  I like butter as much as the next person, but the pasta only tasted of butter and LOTS of parmesean.  My chicken Marsala was ok.  Nothing special.  Dessert came and we sat and waited for spoons before we got to eat our 1/2 melted ice cream.  Our drinks were never refilled- not even once.  The server was quick with running my credit card once he FINALLY came back and got it.  That was the only good service we saw.  My point...  The service was horrible.  The food was nearly ok.  The building is interesting.  It's a neat place, but neat isn't good.  Maybe it use to be good at one time.  I didn't see any of it.  Except the hot sourdough bread.  That's good.  Look I found something good in all of this!  I don't think I'll be back.",

Here is some of the issues I have When you go as a big party the tip is automatically included in your meal which in my opinion makes the waiting staff not care about the level of service they provide. I understand the pay for a server is lower than any other profession but for this reason you have to have the customer service skills to make people want to give you a good tip.  The food was not good at all!!! There was no flavor in any of it and if I can make better homemade spaghetti from scratch  I expect an Italian restaurant to make some better than me.  The dishes were dirty. They gave you clear plastic cups for water and sodas and you can see how dirty the dishes are, it just makes you question what else they don't clean right. Never again will I come to the spaghetti factory I would rather go else where or make my own if I am in need of some Italian food.",

I had been wanting to try this place but never really felt the need to go out of my way to make it happen. Needless to say I was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged.    Presentation C: They are renovating right now, there were no signs coming into the parking lot indicating the entrance. We (of course) attempted to enter through the main entrance, only to be stop by a small piece of paper that said the entrance was the other end of the building. Ugh. Who likes to walk on gravel in 4'' heels?   The overall feel of the restaurant is very warm, the furniture and decor is all antique, resembles broken down shipping crates, antique lighting, but  still very well lit. Our group sat in a group dinning area behind the hostess stand so we got to see everyone that walked in, which was a little distracting. People were standing by our entrance waiting for their table, poor design.    Staff D+:  Hostess did not greet upon walking into the restuarant, after arriving to her stand we saw our group seated directly behind her and we sat ourselves.  Our group had been seated for 15 minutes prior to our arrival, granted we were still waiting for others, 15 minutes in and no one at the table had drinks. Really? The waiter wasn't very friendly, his service was very poor. He would disappear for 10-15 between each action. Drink order.... 15 minutes till drink delivery. Drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes. He finally returns to take our food order food takes 20 minutes... we eat. We're done. He doesn't check on us at all during the process... 10 minutes after we are done eating he returns to take our ice cream order.... I think you get the point. I'm sure you're probably asking yourself,.... were they busy? No. At least it didn't look busy to me.  Food C-: This part will be short and sweet. The food is mediocre at best, I can make it at home. I got the Chicken Parmigiana with Fettuccine Alfredo. The portion of food in comparison to the price, is small. It is not a lot of food at all.The taste was very bland for Italian I found myself adding salt.   Best thing about the restaurant is the building and decor,i'm curious about the renovations. The staff needs to be more friendly and welcoming and they need to deliver a better experience for the customer. The food portions need to be increased by 20%. I've never eaten Italian food and not had to have a to go box. Especially for the price we paid.  I would only return if I was invited and accompanied by a group and everyone else wanted it.",

Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed - especially the kids.  Luckily, they were on their best behavior even though they were exhausted.  I think the staff was appreciative that they were mostly clean and quiet.  We ordered the ravioli, spaghetti with Italian sausage and 2 kid's macaroni and cheeses.  I love that their meals are served \"complete\" with a salad, bread, and ice cream or spumoni.  Even the kids got milk, applesauce, and dessert as well.    The kids loved the train, and the staff encouraged us to explore and ring the bell.  We quietly tip-toed through the car (between other eating patrons) to the front and rang the bell while both were over the moon with excitement.    Tasty lunch with great customer service - thanks OSF Phoenix!",

I ordered the Chicken Parm (well done, and when i asked if it was well the server didnt even know) and was BEYOND disappointed. Its a grilled chicken breast, no flavoring, and they didnt trim off the fat or anything. The cook just threw it on the plate and covered it with their sour, nasty, gross tomato sauce and cheese. I have had this dish all over Phoenix, (Bucca de Beppo, Olive Garden, Carabas) the chicken for this dish is normally pounded flat, then breaded and either baked or fried. This Chicken Parm was the most simple thoughtless dish I have ever had! And at the tune of $11.95 they can keep it! The walls and ceiling were moldy and the service sucked. Smells like cat piss and I recommend you just go somewhere you know has good food and skip the \"history\" and awful decor.",

The wait on this Sunday was 45 minutes, we went before a show at Comerica Theatre and heard a couple of others talk about going so maybe that is the reason it was so busy. You used to be able to by-pass the wait and seat yourself in the bar if space allowed, now it is part of the dining seating as too many whiners complained. lol We didn't know about the change and sat ourselves anyway, Michael helped us this evening, he was waiting on a large party but still gave us excellent service! The Mizithra & Brown Butter pasta is my absolute favorite, a must try! I love their pesto salad dressing and ending the meal with spumoni. I'm not so sure I would wait the 45 minutes, I get that they want you to wait it out and drink in the bar but that's not my thing, if I'm sitting there, I'm eating! Making a reservation is a must for a large party but for just two people, not sure they do it. I guess I'll be looking into that in the future.",

    "text": "I don't want to wax nostalgic here, but I have fond memories of a Spaghetti Factory from long ago.  Numerous trips to the library or art museum in Phoenix, followed by a trip to the this location.   In the early to mid 1980's I remember the Tempe location serving hungry college students 2 for 1 meal  specials on  Sunday afternoons.  In more recent years, this Phoenix location has been a family favorite, suitable for get-togethers, child friendly, centrally located.    A few years ago, I would be giving a 4 star rating. My most recent visits have Spaghetti Factory at a solid 3.  Why, you ask?  Well, I'm happy to share!  Keep in mind the name of this restaurant:  SPAGHETTI Factory.    The menu:  what was once an easy to navigate document is now overloaded with too many options.  Spaghetti is buried in the middle of the book.    Let's face it folks, spaghetti is cheap. Keep the menu simple, with its namesake food easy to find.    More frustrating is the lunch structure.  For years one could get their favorite spaghetti and sauce combos in a smaller quantities, with drink and spumoni inclusive, for a reduced rate.  Now, lunch options are salads or sandwiches, with a pasta option offered as a note at the top.  No drink or spumoni option, unless you buy the dinner size.  Why???    Thank goodness they've kept their pasta sauces the same.  You can't go wrong with any of them- one of my favorites is the spaghetti with half meat sauce and half brown butter mizithra cheese.  Sublime!  The mushroom sauce is another tempting choice.  My husband loves the clam sauce, and my kids are all over the board.    I like the addition of the option for steamed broccoli in large quantity- an excellent option for a large family gathering.  Salads are still crisp and cold, dressings still fresh, bread still warm and tasty.  I've ordered salad entrees, great quality and balance of flavors.  Really, no complaints about the food, but the food is not all there is to a good rating.  Combine the lack of menu focus and lost menu options with consistantly (last 4 visits) slow food service, and we move from a 4 to a 3.  Servers are friendly enough, but it seems that everyone is moving in slow motion, save for a couple managers and long-term servers, scurrying about.    Just a little tightening up on service, plus a simplification of menu (bring back the lunch drink option), and I think we could hit the 4 star zone once again.",

I got the combo of Mushroom Sauce and the Mizithra Brown Butter Sauce. Skip the mushroom or any combo involving the marinara. It is not that great.  The MIzithra is pretty awesome though. EXTREMELY cheesy (not in a gooey way, but in a salty buttery rich way)... I could feel my arteries clogging.   The best was probably the garlic Mizithra - pretty much the basic jazzed up with garlic, bacon and mushrooms. The husband chose well with that selection.   IF I was made to come again, I would get the Garlic Mizithra.   But honestly? For these prices (about $12/plate), I could (and would) make a freakin Italian feast at home.",

The sauce that it came with was great but not enough of it as it only covered half the serving so if you order this and like sauce on your ravioli ask for extra sauce.  My daughter ordered the shrimp garlic fettuccini and it was good too. Her food came with enough sauce and the shrimp were super tasty. The salad was just lettuce and a couple croutons however, the house dressing that they substitute for ranch is some kind of a pesto dressing and is amazing.  Again, this is sometimes an issue of not enough dressing so ask for it on the side if you like your salad actually dressed.  The dinner does include some limited drink choices, salad or soup and a scoop of ice cream.  Overall a good value.",

The hostess and what appeared to be a manager were taking names.  The manager was so funny and personanable...when the girl said \"what is your name?\"  I spelled A-M-Y instead of just saying my dam name....when he called my name he spelled Amy instead! ! LOL. Date and I laughed!  We ordered our food with our server, who was nice and knowledegable enough. But, we had to ask for our Bread!  For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce, dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty!  Date got a cheese pasta dish, and he said it was to cheesy.  O well.

When we got there, the wait was pretty short, my husband requested a seat in the train, so we walked around the lobby while our table was being prepared. I'm glad we had the time to stroll around, all the creepy old rooms were awesome. The PacMan game is a great touch.  As we approached the table, my 5 year old's smile stretched from to ear at the sight of walking up those train car stairs. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was good, I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  I'm not a foodie, so this is not about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. The food was good enough to not lose any stars because of it.   The refills were on point. The only negative was that all of the tables around us were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, would be a tight fit with the possibility of him bumping in to us.  The check was small. Love that. It's a very affordable restaurant.  Next time we come, we're riding the tram and sitting at the bar. I forgot how cool this place was. We were glad the kids had a weird spaghetti craving that night.",

The parking is about the worst I have seen literally no space and every other car seemed to be double parked in some way or another. The worst thing about our dining experience was the chunky vomit. A couple was leaving and unfortunately the woman got sick. I understand it wasn't planned and things happen. My complaint is that the staff saw it and it stayed there 10 ft from my table for the better part of ten minutes before being taken care of. another patron had gotten up twice to tell people about it.  I myself got up once and told the host please take care of it. Several, and I do mean several, workers walked by looking at it. One even came back and sprinkle something on it.you can tell by the looks of some other tables, that they don't particularly like looking at the vomit while they eat either. My main problem is why couldn't they have covered it? I called the manager over to complain, and she merely said it is being taken care of.  it should have been covered with a napkin or something else within seconds as it was witnessed by staff when it occurred. We didn't finish our dinner and didn't do our desserts. The manager showed no empathy of any sort. Merely shrugging it off.  My advice, beware of the chunky vomit sauce at this spaghetti company.",

They didn't even have Italian dressing at an Italian restaurant and they didn't have ranch!! What in the world?! I could have made better spaghetti  and fed 4 people other than just 2 for just $10. Not worth it. And the smell was horrid!! It smelt like dirty feet. It literally was the worst smell while eating. Not to mention our waitress didn't check on us. She took forever to get our order and then never checked on us after she took it. She delivered our food and walked away. I would not recommend this place to anyone! Bad food, bad smell, and bad service. Won't be going back.",

Our experience last night was enough for us to never go back. They threw us out of the room in the middle of opening gifts, and we had to have cake outside in the parking lot!!! We reserved the room at 4pm and we were never told that we only had the room for two hours! If you are planning a party and spending $600-$800 you may want to find a different place! Additionally they had only two servers and one was a trainee. We had been in the room for an hour before we got drinks or even bread. When I asked if they could bring some bread, they said it will come out with the salad. It was was one horrible moment after another. They give you a choice of 4 menu items, and the Italian sausage has slimy casing on it! Was not even cooked properly, and the marinara tasted like it was from a can or a jar! I cannot believe how we were treated. And the manager came in and angrily yelled and made everyone leave!!! Wow!!  I wanted to share so other parties don't get ruined by this manager that should really not be In Hospitality. They add the gratuity and most of my family are generous and added additional gratuity! We used to come here and do a party at least 6-8 times a year! Thank you for reading!",

She should know, she was our server.  She went and got those items.  When she brought them, she suggested taking our entrees back and getting new ones.  By then, it was getting late and we were on a time frame.   The meal was just okay.  I will say that I have ever had a \"sauce\" with so much rosemary in it.  It doesn't belong there and was overpowering.  The Caesar salad was good.  The bread was good.",

First the hostess had a extreme attitude when we walked in with us and mind you it was just two of us not a huge party. Then we get seated almost 45 minutes later to wait even longer for our waiter  by this time we're starving and thirsty. We gave him our drink order takes him ummmmm 15 minutes to bring our drinks which were wrong btw When he did we said we were ready to order he got a attitude but took our order. We waited another 15 minutes or longer for bread and salad  then our food came cold at this point were tired hungry and just ready to go. We boxed it up and waited another 15 minutes for the bill he walked away and we waited a long time for him to come get the bill. He only checked in us once the entire time we ran out of soda had to wait for his one check in. It was ridiculous and never had cold food come out. The hostess was snotty face every time she walked by and we did nothing to her.  I've come to this place since I was a kid never had service like this before just disappointing.",

My boyfriend and I arrived after the other three in our party. Our server didn't come back for about 7 minutes and was really frazzled. She asked what we were drinking and mid drink order, she stopped us, walked away and then came back and said, \"I just can't handle this. I need help with my tables.\" No apology to us for interrupting and just walking away. She was very overwhelmed with 4 tables and I am unsure why. We were all super chill and the three tables that were seated roughly at the same time were all really close together and no one was rude or really needy that I could tell.   We eventually ordered and received our meal. We had to keep asking for drink refills from the server and she wasn't really prompt with refilling water glasses. What is even more irritating to me is that she never once apologized to us for the way she acted. She was quite rude when we asked for anything and had no issues reaching over our plates. My whole experience was ruined by this one older server who truly seems like she would fit in better at a hole in the wall diner where her crap attitude would be acceptable.    The food however, was great. Italian food is hard to mess up, but the food was reasonably priced and we received salad, some bread and a scoop of ice cream with every meal.",

The food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate for adults and children alike.   I love the wooden floors, the cable car that sits in the center (it's a treat to be seated inside!), the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy & the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique chairs.  This location is on Central, directly across from the light rail. Unlike most restaurants in the area, it has a very large parking lot. Not having to worry about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable :)",

Once it was our time, one of the lovely host sat us and was very nice to us. Then, we waited again, another 15 min went by, our server finally introduced myself and took our drink order. Ok, he dropped it off and we waited again for him to take our food order.. After that, we looked around because we haven't been to this place, only in Chandler. Had a nice conversation with my family, good laughs. I Seen people got there food before us, kind of made me mad because our server was slacking! and wasn't on top of things.. Yes! Our food arrived... Became unsatisfied  I'm not very fond of garlic, Their it was all over my Angel hairs and chicken.. If my mother in law, kindness wasn't there.

    "text": "This was our first and last experience at the Old Spaghetti Factory. We walked in yesterday evening and I promptly greeted the two hostesses at the front desk. They were chatting amongst themselves, turned to look at me, and then went back to chatting with each other. My husband, thinking  they hadn't heard me, also greeted them and we were once again met with the same chilly silence. An awkward moment passed where they stared at us and we stared at them before one of the hostesses turned and grabbed three menus and walked us through a nearly empty restaurant - passed all the lovely tables,  architectural details, and charming decor - all the way back to the bowels of the restaurant. We were sat at a dingy table on the kitchen's doorstep. Who doesn't enjoy being serenaded by clanking dishes, wait staff yelling at each other, and the general cacophony of a kitchen in a nearly empty restaurant? How thoughtful. The waiter, who was far more friendly than the hostesses, was nice enough if not a bit bungling. He stepped on my husband's foot once and even hit him with the serving tray accidentally. We were off to a great start.   Our food was as miserable as the service. The sourdough bread came with a side of warm margarine, and the minestrone soup was a little too close to canned-tasting for my liking. My husband had the #3 which came with two meatballs, spaghetti with meat sauce, and an Italian sausage. (He fared the best.) His son had the pope pourri (poo pourri) which is spaghetti with four different, equally sad, canned sauces. I ordered the jumbo crab raviolis which were served unexpectedly lukewarm/cold and dry with a little warm sauce and oil. There is nothing special about the food - it's edible, yes, but it's also lacking anything crave-able. The food is overpriced for what you get. It's \"competitively priced\" with trendy midtown eateries, but lacking all of the flavor, care, and quality that makes the other places so very worth it.   The highlight of the evening came when the waiter brought the check and cough/laughed enveloping the table in a thick, aromatic blanket of smoke which hung in the air like a moist hug. It was the perfect unappetizing, terrible end to a generally terrible experience.",

    "text": "The Old Spaghetti Factory is a place of many memories for me.  When I turned 18, my friends and I went to OSF by whim.  We had be doing research at the Burton Bar Library and it was just right there.  When we first walked it, we were mesmerized by the comfy looking couches, the retro games, the sleigh in the corner...  and when we sat down to eat in those big velvet chairs, we were hooked.  It was love at first sight.  We even got to take home our glasses since we had the Italian sodas!  The food is excellent, portions are decent, and you get some spumoni at the end of your meal.  How great is that?  With prom being one or two weeks later, we all went with our dates and a bigger group back to the OSF.  Everybody loved the food.  We were all dolled about and had a great time there!  Now when I look in my cupboards six years later, I see a dozen OSF glasses.  If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of the place.  :3",

We asked for straws and she didn't have any. So she turned around and took the ones from the table next to us. The people from that table left when we sat.. Their table was still dirty.

Because, the owner got divorced he lost this location to his wife, who had it join the Chain of Spaghetti Factory. At first with all the changes, it suffered and was not as good as the Company was.  But, they have ironed it out a bit and now it is better.  The food is good. Not authentic Italian, but for the price it is a fantastic deal. Nothing to complain about at all.  You get a lot of food for a very low price. It is decorated really great. Very old fashioned Victorian style. Servers are friendly and do the best they can, because this place is always packed full.  You get soup or salad, bread and butter, a meal , and dessert. All for less than $10.00. The menu has a lot to choose from as well. It is a great place to take children, because the whole family can go out and it does not break the bank.  Bathrooms are clean, and lots of parking, additional in the back.",

    "text": "I remember when going to the Spaghetti Company was something to look forward to. Back then (about 30 years ago) it was one of the few restaurants in town, so the wait was considerable. That lobby is still there with the same stand-up video games and circa 20s sofas (reupholstered of course) and the restaurant still seems to be a place for an adventurous child to find hidden secrets and exotic places. Back then the wait to sit in the trolley (since removed and replaced with a replica) was over an hour. As a child the mystique of its cavernous faux Tiffany-style glass-enclosed \"rooms\" was a wondrous delight that could now only be matched in adult scale by the extravagance of the Winchester mansion of California.  I've been back 4 or 5 times in recent months and am consistently surprised that for a restaurant that could seat a thousand, I must wait 10 to 15 minutes for a table. Tonight I was making my way back across the cavernous lobby to leave when I was called to be seated. I should have just left.  Once inside I discover why the wait is so long. Every table as far as the eye can see is covered with dirty dishes and glasses, but no one is sitting at any of them. How long they have been in such a state is anyone's guess, but tonight I was able to sit in the fake trolley and so was afforded the opportunity to see that only 2 of them were cleared throughout my entire meal. What a disgrace! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!  Our server was extremely attentive and did his job with careful precision and punctuality. The only major error was when he kicked a piece of trash in the small walkway between trolley tables to a nearby corner. Oh my God; I just wanted to get up and go over and pick it up. Was that a crust of bread??!?!?! When he first arrived at our table, I asked if he needed some help clearing all these tables. What a disgrace! He told me that when he walked in, there were 130 people waiting in the lobby.  The food was exactly as expected -- somewhere below the quality of an Olive Garden. I think someone else here may have made the same comparison. Pasta overcooked to the point it can just barely hold its form anymore; meat sauce so gritty you wonder if this is what Manwich tastes like. Meatballs well formed and of overall good taste, but spiced with powdered everything, and old powder at that. Parmesan passed my test with little recognizable filler and of good body. Didn't taste like sawdust.  Bread obviously ordered by the hundred thousand, and obviously arrived frozen and partially cooked, Shamrock style, with the finish in a quick-heat just before serving. The cutting boards still have a second indentation for the garlic butter, but none was served. The butter that arrived was nothing like butter, but instead a whipped watery creamy colored stuff that should be the last straw that finally convinces you to throw down your napkin and sue \"I can't believe it's not butter\" for False advertising.  The salad was mostly dismal. The only redeeming ingredient in the entire meal was the olive oil used in the \"balsamic\" vinaigrette. I had to take several concentrated bites to try to convince myself that the red-wine vinegar they were trying to pass off as Balsamic was not actually cleaning-grade white vinegar, but the olive oil was really nice. Never mind  the basil or parsley or the whatever-name-you-can-come-up-with tasteless flakes in the dressing that had to be at least 20 years old. Ew.  There are times when I wish I could go back. I wish I hadn't dined under the artistry of chefs who celebrate the creation of cuisine. I used to be able to enjoy this crap, oblivious to the talent that's out there. Unfortunately Phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots. Where is our talent? Surely it is not at the Old Spaghetti Factory.",

Although the Spaghetti Factory's decorations and ambience really add to it's character, none of that matters when you have the service like we did. We made a reservation thinking it would help us avoid wait times and still ended up waiting 10 minutes when we arrived. When we eventually were seated we had the worst service in recent memory. Our waiter was soft spoken and didn't give much of an intro and brought our drinks with our soup and salad. Once we had finished our soup and salad and both of our beverages we waited twenty minutes before we received refills. Forty minutes in a queried about our appetizer to which the waiter said he would ask the kitchen, the place he had seemingly been hiding out in most of the time. When he returned he said there was a mistake and we could cancel the appetizer or it would come out with our entrees. No apology was made or attempt to make it right. Meanwhile the table next to us received there meals even though they had been sat after us. We then were brought our entrees by a kitchen staff. I ordered the chicken parmigiana which came lukewarm with a glob of spaghetti while my wife ordered the ravioli. The waiter then brought the bill without asking us what ice cream we'd like, a part of the three course meal which we were not offered. After I'd paid I tracked down a manager to see if there was still some hope they might make it right. Nope! The manager seemed to express a disingenuous apology and said \"hopefully it's better next time for you\". Clearly the customer is an afterthought here. There definitely will not be a next time.",

    "text": "For Review 200 I wanted to take something from my bookmark list. I was downtown for the Herberger Theater and passed by the Old Spaghetti Factory. I used to visit the OSF in Atlanta and when I lived in Ohio. I remember always enjoying the experience...  Nostalgia is better than reality.  My friend ordered the fettuccini alfredo and I went with the garlic mizithra...which is a twist on the standard mizithra cheese & spaghetti plate I typically order. This added garlic, mushrooms and bacon. The food was good, but fairly average. The portions were smaller than I remembered.   The sourdough bread was good - still warm. The restaurant opened in 1972 and I think they have been making salads the same way since Day 1. It was an iceberg lettuce classic and although I ordered blue cheese, it arrived with vinaigrette. Rather than send it back I kept the salad.   Perhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask \"is everything fantastic?\" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said \"Is everything excellent?\" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.    Another annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it.   Finally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.  Overall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that. I don't think I need to revisit this restaurant any time soon.",

I get the spaghetti w clam sauce, hubby gets the meat lovers, mom gets the half and half which is spinach & cheese raviolis w spaghetti w rich meat sauce. Kids always get the Italian creme sodas w fruit flavor and they get to keep the glass. The salad w the balsamic vinegar and olive oil is delish. And all meals come w ice cream to finish off ur dinner. Spamoni or vanilla are the choices... The decor is just darling here, literally step back in time when ever I walk into spaghetti factories. It's a 1920s vintage moulin rouge  and train station all mixed into one w velvet couches, & a trolly cart in the middle of the restaurant that you can dine in as well.",

I was seated after only a very short wait and was cared for by Amber, Her service was excellent and there was plenty of food! (salad, bread, pasta, sauce and dessert).  I also enjoyed a great g and t from the bar.  Rian was attentive and as I watched the other staff work I could see that they all shared this trait.  It's not always easy to go to someplace alone; but, I felt right at home here.  Thanks.",

    "text": "We were in the general vicinity of The Old Spaghetti Factory and decided it would be THE place for lunch today. When we walked in, the hostess said it would be about 15 minutes but it was less than 5. Nice!   What I liked most about the OSF is that everyone--EVERYONE--is friendly and attentive, asking if all is good, if they could get anything more and thanking us for being there. And then there's the food. As many other reviewers have raved about, the Mizithra in browned butter is amazing. So good that it's my splurge from my low-carb diet. That and a piece of the sourdough bread. And I really like the balsamic vinaigrette. It's just...good. Homey, welcoming and easy to be there. It's not loud like some restaurants, allowing for good conversation to flow. It's like they know that the eating experience is not just about the food but it's the atmosphere, the customer service and making people feel welcome.  So kudos for manager Stephan and all his crew. Looking forward to seeing y'all again. And again. Oh, and again :)",

Was seated at our  table and waited a full 10 minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and order our drinks on a Friday at lunchtime when the restaurant was not that busy. I think he clearly forgot about us but would be more attentive with our meal. Offered  chowder (do not know the difference between Manhattan or New England) as an option for a soup and later came back to us and told us that he was out, that can happen but he should've known. The lunch was lap luster and his pressuring for us to get ice cream afterwards was not necessary. I honestly don't know where all the positive reviews get come from I will never be back.",

I now believe I know why.while a wait to get is not that bad,  they apparently don't do reservations prior to 8 pm. The wait was about 20 mins at 4 p.m.  The place was about 1/3 full at the time. The speed of service throughout was glacial. Server mastered the art of the is there anything else I can... and wandered off just as the refill of coffee was being requested.   The 90 min 3 course, only 1 refill on coffee, a success rate of 1 in 4 requests.  Salad wilted,  flat and unimaginative, blue cheese dressing didn't appear to be blue cheese, I could have been eating a painting from daycare.   Wife's side-order of chicken breast came out in chunks and some kind of marinade that wasn't requested._(Separate items on the menu)  Too many mistakes to make it worthwhile to enjoy the entrees which were better than average for the type but overshadowed by the main experience.  Slow, inaccurate and yeah their booths have little nails on them that catch clothing.  So ripping them a new one  is merely returning the favor.:P   Ca service was great, all food was fresh and all orders correct it's a shame that can't travel east.",

They're all standing there talking to one another. One finally recognizes us and we ask \" can we have a table for 9 people under Jenn please? \". She doesnt give us eye contact and just stares at the screen. She replies with \" how many and what's the name? \" like hello. We just told you, do you pay attention??? We repeat it again and now we see she recognizes how many there are of us and just passes us along to one of her partners. The partner, still with no effort of being a nice host, doesn't even give us a fake high voice , tells us our wait time. We accept it and talk about how shitty the hosts were tonight. So we look for another restaurant and ditch this place.   HOST: you know you are the face of the restaurant because we, the customers, see YOU when WE walk in. So, put on a smile because we are paying your bills.   TLDR:  THE HOST SERVICE SUCKS ASS HERE. THEY ARE SO RUDE AND DEF DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FAKE BEING NICE, EVEN FOR THEIR JOB. PLEASE OSF MANAGER TALK TO THEM. I am a host myself, so I know what I'm talking about.",

I like vintage because I was born in the wrong century. Any who, come to this place if you don't mind below average and not so friendly waiters. (At least ours was lacking) also the ice cream at the end of your meal is a plus. Don't ask questions about the ghosts, the waiters will literally run. So I didn't see a ghost.",

Although the food was great, drinks went without refills and we spent over 2 hours with only a couple other tables in the restaurant. My child ordered Mac n cheese which we weren't informed they were out of until after everyone's meals had already arrived, so our child went without eating anything.

I love the decor and the trolley! Our waiter Lidia was so sweet and attentive.   The food was delicious! The meat sauce was a huge hit for our table. It was so flavorful. They do have gluten free pasta and gluten free sauce options.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere, food and attentive service.

They have an extensive waiting area with about a dozen tables with six seats or more leading us to believe that waits are common here.  We ordered ravioli, spaghetti with meatballs, and fettucine alfredo. I wish I had taken pictures but then again, they would have been unimpressive. Sauce was either too tart or wholly bland. Portions were small considering the price.  Just imagine cardboard and the color brown. These describe the general impression I received from this establishment's ambiance.   Good aspects were attentive service and complimentary ice cream dessert (your choice of sherbert or spumoni).  I think you'd have a better time at Olive Garden.",

    "text": "I will always rate Old Spaghetti Factory with 5 stars. It is amazing EVERY TIME. This was our first time at the one in Phoenix and, honestly, it is either the second coolest or in tie for the 1st coolest one I have been to. I have been to the one in Phoenix, Spokane, and St. Louis. The waiter was awesome and brought out a little ice cream dish with a candle in it for my husband's birthday.   For those of you who have not been to a Spaghetti Factory, you will be FULL when you leave the restaurant. I am in love with the brown butter Mizithra noddles. It's amazing! They give you bread for an appetizer, a salad or soup, your meal, and ice cream at the end. You MAY OR MAY NOT have leftovers , it just depends on how much you enjoy it at the moment. I normally have leftovers, but there are times I chow down on the goodness.   At this location, they have fish tanks inside of an old gas pump (I believe that's what it is). We made reservations and only had to wait about 5 minutes, if that. They have some old arcade games in the \"waiting room\", near the bathrooms. There's PLENTY of tables for customers. All of the decorations and lighting is amazing! If I remember correctly, the building is over 100 years old and part of it, was someone's house.   It's an overall amazing experience.",

    "text": "The Old Spaghetti Factory has been a family staple for many years.  We used to love coming here with our kids for a good time, great portions of pasta and a unique, antique and relaxed atmosphere.  While some menu items have changed, we still enjoy the white clam sauce (which, I'm the first to admit is like a white clam gravy), the kids' meals are fantastic and the mizithra with browned butter is still a dish that speaks for itself.  The pasta is al dente and the bread is hot and fresh.    However, over the years the service has gone downhill.  We have avoided our favorite place because of the long drive, and found the price just wasn't worth the trip anymore.  Last week, we chanced it again.  The wait was moderate and the drinks were strong (and surprisingly so!).  The food was very good and the waitstaff was on their game.  BUT - the lobby.  Oh, the glorious lobby which used to be filled with large antique furniture, including an old-fashioned sled the people could sit in to wait.  The \"Spaghetti Tree\" was leafy and dusted and nice - not so much this time.  The lobby is in very ill-repair.  It is no longer inviting - it is, instead, rundown and depressing.  Kids run rampant and why not?  It no longer looks like a place where one should sit nicely and wait for a table.  The Spaghetti Tree is showing its age, with layers of dust and missing leaves, and the \"pasta case\" is still filled with the same noodles that have been inside of it for years.   It is way past time for the owners to take the time and spend the money to fix up the lobby and restore it to its days of glory.  No, this is not a new restaurant.  Yes, it still needs a spit and polish to make it really shine.  This is one chain that has never felt like a chain, and in order to stay open with all of the new businesses in the area, it is more than time for a revamp.  Old Spaghetti Factory, we have given you a second chance.  Its time that you invited us back by showing that you too, care about your restaurant.",

The last visit was not so great, though.  The manager seemed less than thrilled to host our group of 26 people in the bar.  Even though the bar was empty when we arrived and we were paying customers, I felt we were unwelcome visitors.  The manager did agree to give us a $5 special cocktail, but considering we probably gave them the busiest Saturday bar night in awhile... I felt she could have been more gracious.  The bartenders were nice and friendly, hence the two star rating.",

    "text": "We had a poor dining experience from the time we entered the restaurant to the time we left.  I contacted them via email and wrote the following:  Last night at roughly 5:30pm (1/15/17) our family had dinner at your Phoenix location.  The service we received was poor at best and the management just as bad.  Our server failed on so many levels I don't know where to start.  Our meals were brought out before our salads and bread, my daughter's meatball was forgotten, and our server was missing in action most of the evening.  It was so bad that we had to ask the bussers for our missing food items, go boxes and silverware.  In fact, at the end of the meal we had to ask for the spumoni ice cream and a go box from our waitress.  After she brought it out, with the check and no go box, we asked for spoons.  After 5 minutes with our server nowhere in sight I got up, found a busboy, and got the silverware.  This was a full 10 minutes after we got the dessert.  Several more minutes passed and our server was still nowhere to be found so I took the check to the front, spoke with a host and asked if he could cash us out since our waitress was MIA.  A woman standing next to him said she would handle it.   After the bill was paid taken we asked to speak with a manager.  Turns out, the women who handled the bill was the manager.  She came to our table, put the check down and left without saying a word.   I would think if a customer came to the front like I did a manager might want to find out what was going on and speak to the customer about it.  Not this manager, it was pretty clear she could care less.  When she came back we voiced our displeasure with the service and were told that she had spoken with the server about coming back and checking on us.  I told her no one did to which she replied she did what she could.  The manager was indifferent to us, looked hurried and troubled and made lots of excuses.  She was dismissive of her demeanor, the poor service, and displayed an attitude of total disregard for us.  On our way out we passed by her and some of the front staff and were glared at as we exited.  Not a goodbye, thanks for coming, or how was your meal, just stares, and bad body language.  When we got home I went online and read some of the recent reviews for this location.  Turns out many people have experienced the same poor service and management my family and I did. You should know that we have been customers for 20+ years.  Sad to say, that we will not be coming back.  There are so many options available, why would anyone want to come back?  It should be noted, management emailed me and invited us back.",

Hungry, we reached the McDowell Road stop about 5pm and got off to dine at the Old Spaghetti Factory. Upon entering a nearly empty restaurant, it took the hostess girl several confused minutes to seat us. We eagerly waited well over five minutes for someone to bring us glasses of water, which typically happens automatically in Phoenix restaurants in June, when a waitress finally appeared and took our drink and dinner orders. Still no water. While waiting at least another ten minutes, no drinks or water, we observed several, if not many, other employees standing around talking to one another or just doing nothing. Still no water. We then walked out and will not ever go there again.",

Broccoli was hardly cooked. The server gave us one drink refill and we never saw him again after he collected the check (I pulled out my own bottled water). I don't send food back to the kitchen or make a scene, but I don't return. I cannot recommend this spot.",

I used to like this place when I was a kid but then again I was a kid. I probably liked it for its unique atmosphere and indoor train caboose. Me and my girlfriend went there last night and was seated in what I thought the smallest table in the place I'm 6-3 and weigh 450 lbs so I asked the waitress if she could please seat us in another larger table. She blankly stared at me extremely dumbfounded. Like she didnt understand anything I just said. It was very uncomfortable. After explaining that I was too big and needed more room a few times and talking slow I finally convinced her to give me another table. So she took me to another table that ended up being the exact same size. At this point I was very upset luckily a gentleman named Francisco stepped in and took us to another table that was larger. He brought us our food and refills before our waiter did and he was a busser. He was all over the place cleaning tables, serving drinks he was all over the place and actually made our night a lot better. On our way out we decided to tell the manager about what a good employee Francisco is.  But this is one place I will not go back too.",

The antique dining furniture combined with healthy portions of good food make this one of my favorite restaurant chains.  Free ice cream after a meal doesn't hurt its repertoire either.",

I really want to give this place 2.5 stars but the food was just not all that.  B R I E F  S U M M A R Y -- Nice big parking lot -- Train stops right in front (I took it from the Westin) -- Interesting old arcade but some stuff is broken and doesn't work -- Chain restaurant & they seem to be all about the same -- Service is decent considering 30+ people -- Salad is iceburg mix = below average -- Pesto dressing = their take on ranch -- House bread is good when it's hot and fresh -- Appetizers were just OK -- Garlic cheese bread with marinara was probably the best -- Olive dip was weird - not my thing -- Artichoke dip was OK - thought it was interesting that it had shrimp -- Meatball sliders were decent -- Don't bother with the Lasagne, it tasted so processed -- Chicken Marsala was way more edible than the lasagne but still average -- Free spumoni was the best thing all night!  Sorry but I actually have one of these restaurants in my town. I would rate them all below Olive Garden in reference to food quality and taste. Service can differ, of course. I thought our server(s) did a decent job with 30+ people in my party. There were long pauses and then it was like the kitchen was pounding us with food.   Originally I wanted to give them 3 stars but the food quality was bad. I couldn't justify an average rating for way below average Italian. I definitely would have rather had Olive Garden or a Mom & Pop's Italian joint. The appetizers weren't too bad but really just unfulfilling and heavy carbs (duh, it's Italian). My entree was really disappointing. I was able to put down the Chicken Marsala but the Lasagne was just meh. I could taste the greasy ground beef and it had no flavoring or freshness to it.  This experience just solidified my opinion on all Spaghetti Factories. I would pass if I were you but I'm not sure what other options there are in Phoenix.",

I ended up locking my bike to a pipe behind the restaurant and worrying the whole time.   This year, my friend Joseph had a bicycle rack in his truck.  It was a special bike rack that the city offered to local businesses.  He pulled it out of his truck and put it in front of the restaurant.  We locked up and went in to eat.  When we finished, we returned to find that a couple of bikes who were not in our party had locked up to the rack.  We found the manager of the restaurant, and he and Joseph worked out the details for maintaining the safety of the rack and returning it to its rightful owner.  As we unlocked our bikes, a party of 10-12 bicyclists from the neighborhood pulled in and waited for us to vacate the rack.  Bicycle racks bring business, yo!",

    "text": "Heard so many reviews of this restaurant of how great this place is, but, never went. Luckily a friend wanted to do a secret farewell/ hang out for a coworker. The atmosphere is cozy and ambience. Many vintage layouts which is a plus for me. Got to sit next to a library of old books which was awesome. Fast services on the drinks, but, a bit slow on the foods coming out... but, who cares when you had a huge group with you to enjoy the dinner with. Ask the server to do a secret celebration for a friend early birthday and she did for me anyway (don't know about you, but, that is great customer services right there). The prices are decent, but, the portion is a tad small for those prices. Nonetheless, delicious and fulfilling. Would go again if given a second chance. P.S. order their Italian Cream Soda because you gets to keep the cute cup as a souvenir.",

She was amazing, she kept up best she could on drinks, breads etc, not due to her some of the food was cold, she deserves a huge pat on the back for being amazing. The food was not good Italian food, the manager who made it clear that he would not be helping her do anything but make sure the food came out on time. They did good but the quality of food wasn't good. The salad was fresh out of the bag, not good. We had reservations so they should have assigned more people to help The service from Amber on her birthday was fantastic. We sang to her, made her understand as doing it all solo she was amazing. I'd go back but only to sit in her section. 3 stars was for the food.... 5 stars for service all the way!!! Thank you again Amber!!!.",

The inside looks as if it were an old hotel, turned into a restaurant. Lots of cute decor and signs everywhere.  The food was good! Not the best in town, but definitely a great deal for the prices and for being a downtown restaurant. The cocktail I ordered was so-so, but good enough to wear I didn't feel like it was a waste of money.

    "text": "The last time I went to an Old Spaghetti Factory was in California, ages ago.  It was awesome then.  Now?  It sucks.  We arrived around 5.  No crowd.  At the podium were 4 young women who looked like petulant teenagers, pissed to have to be at work.  The stared us down until we were in front of them.  Nary a smile to be seen.  The one in front of the screen looked at us and said, \"Two?\".  We said, \"Yes.\"  She said so and so will take you to your table.  So and so fumbled the menus, recovered, drummed up a sort of smile and got us seated.  Waiter comes.  Gets drinks for us.  Never were refilled by the way.  We ordered the meat lovers.  It was awful.  The sauce was, at best, insipid, devoid of any flavor.  The meatballs were so greasy I nearly gagged (we paleo except on Friday cheat night) so you can imagine.  God knows what was in that sausage, but one bite warned me away.  I hope my dogs don't get sick.  The blurb they have about their fresh, homemade food?  Check out the picture of their \"fresh, crisp, greens salad\".  Bag salad.  I am not stupid.  I recognize it when I see it.  The Spumoni was also lackluster.  Oh...wait.  The bread was good and warm.  The Sicilian bread appetizer (cheese bread) was not.  The service was poor.  It was as though these peeps have not been trained to put plates on a table.  We were in one of those cubicles with the table at the center.  Plenty of room to get around.  My salad got delivered to the upper quarter of the paper placemat.  The entree, sideways, to the upper left quadrant, both with the server reaching across the table.  Sheez.  Waste of a good cheat night.  Not doing that again.  Just realized the photo of the salad is on my phone.  Will see if I can attach after I post this.",

After 15min wait we were seated. As we walked back to get seated, the frikkin place was empty. I joked to the hostess that they must be super busy, she replied and said its been slow all day.......... umm confused face emoji!!! What took so long?? Ohh well.. we will see how the food and service are... Atleast the beers good.  Wow food came out quicker then we got seated. Had the #1 \"the premier\" lasagna and chicken marsala. Super good chicken marsala!! All in all we had a good time, except for the wait, but server made up for it! Very attentive, probably because the place was practically vacant! But will not come here anymore, we usually go to the Chandler location. Wayyyy better atmosphere!!",

Can't even describe how poor the service was and how much staff and management conveyed they didn't care. We had a 4:30 reservation and didn't get food until after 6. We were ignored at every step and had to ask after everything. Had to get up and seek a manager multiple times, only to have the response be combative. The excuses were nonstop - your reserved table isn't ready bc nobody ever bussed it earlier, your server is new, the kitchen is behind, we are out of bread, we are out of drinking glasses, we are out of sauce, the kitchen prep guys dropped the ball last night, good news - here's a chicken dish we found leftover from a banquet (ewwwwww). No explanations or check-ins were offered unless we got up and asked. We gave up and left a child's birthday meal w/o ice cream. There was never an apology. All staff, including management, was very young and unprofessional, w/no training, filter, or executive functioning. There did not appear to be anyone adult, experienced or professional on site. What a shame. We used to love OSF and would spend $$$ on large family meals here. Not anymore. Stay away.",

We went to eat to celebrate our friends birthday.  The wait was approx. 30 minutes but with so many cool things to see in the waiting area, time went by quickly.  Our waiter was friendly and kept the drinks coming.  He also made some good recommendations.  We ordered the garlic shrimp alfredo and it was amazingly delicious.  Kids enjoyed their alfredo.  I love that you get bread, a salad, the entree, and a dessert all for a reasonable price.  I believe it was $15 for the garlic shrimp.  Not bad.  And the Shirley Temples are free refills.  Overall, great experience and good food.  Will go back time and time again!",

It's really cool that there are so many places that big groups and small groups can gather for a meal in a somewhat private area. I shared tortellini and Italian sausage with another guest. The plates were huge! Sourdough bread was served hot. It was so yummy. I would have loved to be offered balsamic and olive oil as a go with, but didn't request because of our group size. Service was impeccable! Our group requested separate checks, and we were treated graciously. The restaurant was not crowded when I arrived, and while waiting for others in our group, I perused the decor, dining areas, and lounge. I was very impressed with the cleanliness. The chandeliers sparkled, and I didn't see any dust or grime. This was a wonderful experience, and I'm looking forward to bringing my husband along for an intimate meal soon!",

    "text": "Great place, friendly people, very cool old house turned into a restaurant. The server was not all there, he must have been new. I asked him three times for lemon for water, took him twice to bring a Corona, and he not once checked up on us after our main courses were served to see how the food was. That leads to this, because I was waiting ever so patiently for him to come back and ask - my pasta was very dry, not much sauce on it. I wanted to see if I could have another side of sauce but it seriously took him so long to come back I ended up just eating it. It was a good dish, I'm trying to check the menu right now but it's not showing up. It was veruceli (sp?) pasta, the spiciest on the menu, which I would give it a 6/10 for spicyness. Good place though with decent prices!",

Both were pretty tasty.   What I loved most about this place though was it reminded me of happy times of my childhood. I spent many a birthdays at the one in downtown San Diego. It was nice that it hadn't changed that much...just better drinks now ;)",

I think it was probably in a bowl in the freezer with Saran Wrap on it until that morning--and it was not thawed out fully. That's not a deal-breaker for me though; this is a pasta place.   I wasn't in love with the meatballs, but the sausage was pretty good. I'd go back if I craved just a plate of pasta with no frills, and didn't mind sitting in the middle of creepy decor to have it.",

I only have gotten one dish through all these years and that is really the only reason to go to OSF - get the mizithra spagetti with browned butter. Now that prices for a full meal have nearly doubled (for dinner), the best time to go is during lunch. You still get a giant hot loaf of sourdough bread with real butter, salad or soup and entree for $7.99. Originally, our waiter said the ice tea and desert (scoop of decent sherbert or average spumoni) was extra, but I guess he was feeling nice and he offered those items for free. This cheese is really good when combined with the butter and it is always one of my fav dishes and never had a bad meal at any OSF across the land (west of Nashville only).      Yeah, its an old building, but this is one of the original factories and that lends some charm. Love the spaghetti tree up front and they even have an old school phone booth (with closing doors) to sit in and remember the good ole' days of pay phones and rotary dialing.",

Their lot holds a good number, but it can be tricky to get in and out when crowded - I don't drive my van here.   I am always pleased with the food. I find the salads ok - I really like their Balsalmic Vinigarette dressing - I'll mop the leftover with bread.  I typically get spaghetti with meat sauce and sausage. The sauce has a good flavor.  The Brown Butter with Mizithra Cheese is incredible - but very rich.   The staff is always courteous, and I rarely have to wait for anything.",

Now I've heard rave reviews for years, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the food.  The server was friendly and efficient, and though we waited a bit for our food, they kept the hot bread coming, which was quite tasty.   I had the Italian Sausage sandwich.  It was a few small pieces of sausage, average flavor, on what looked and tasted like a somewhat large hotdog bun that had been on the counter for a while.  I was still hungry afterwards.  Now, I can go to a deli and get a bigger sausage sub with way more sausage for the same price and end up taking half home for later.  I will say that it was not at all expensive and that combined with the decent service is why I gave 3 stars.",

The food is always solid, the atmosphere pleasant, and the waitstaff, though it seems to turn over often, is usually very good.  The fact that most of their meals are inclusive, coming with a drink (soda not included), soup or salad and a choice of spumoni, sherbert or vanilla ice cream at the end is a real bonus!  A great place before a game downtown, to take familiy or friends from out of town, or just because.",

    "text": "Saying you like the OSF to some people seems to be the equivalent of saying you like to eat dog turds off the street. Foo on  you.  OSF doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. It is a basic, solid, basic, unpretentious, basic, fun restaurant; it's the type of restaurant that is disappearing in this country, where we are rapidly becoming a nation of two choices: fast food or upscale. Here you will find generous sized portions, friendly service (almost over-zealously so), and a crowd of diners that are genuinely enjoying their experience. There is always at least 1 birthday song going on somewhere in the restaurant, and I've heard as many as 4 during one visit. You'll see a cable car, you'll hear creaking floors, you'll have ice cream (included) in a small metal dish.  The salads are 100% iceberg. Want field greens or Romaine? Not here. Go somewhere else. The bread usually comes out so hot that you have to wait for it to cool. It tastes much less mass produced than the breadsticks at Olive Garden these days. You can have your spaghetti in the regular size or get the larger portion \"for the hearty appetite\". Where do you see that anymore? They have mizithra cheese. You won't find that at Bucca di Beppo. They have spumoni ice cream. Sorry, didn't notice that the last time I was at Gelato Spot.   It's gotten to the point that I end up dining at OSF alone, with my Kindle. I hear laughs, fake puking sounds, see turned up noses when it is suggested. I've given up. It's definitely retro in atmosphere, and anything but trendy, but its consistent and satisfying.",

    "text": "Awful for months now. No idea if management changed, but this used to be my favorite place. Not any more. I hope this is temporary.  After the worse service I ever had, I waited about two months and came back to see if things were better. It was Sunday at 4:15pm and the restaurant was only about 10% full with about 40% of new customers waiting to be seated.  It was explained to me there was a 20 minute wait (at 4:15 in the afternoon) for a table for 2! Why? A shift change. Really? Every shift for every employee starts and ends at the same time? This is the dumbest excuse for a wait at a restaurant I have ever heard in my life.  So, now the noise in the waiting area is getting louder and louder as more people come in, and no one is seated. The foot traffic of people walking back and forth with no place to go leaves little room for anyone to do anything else other than sit and stare at a wall.  Finally, after more than 20 minutes, they seat us in the bar (where we could just sat ourselves 20 minutes earlier.) They have no intercom system or pager, so the staff is wandering around aimlessly trying to find the people waiting for their table. Where are they? it's a big restaurant and they act like this is their first day in business and have no idea how to seat people or find the people waiting to be seated! When we do get seated, its next to a high-traffic area of people walking back and worth, a small tiny table against the wall and the smell of something awful wafting.  So now I'm trapped between people walking to my right and a wall to my left, an entry area to a dining room directly behind my chair in the bar area.  I got up and left.",

However the food was sub par. The minestrone soup was okay, the bread was a bit stale, the Italian cream soda and spumoni were lovely.   The actual meal I ordered was not good. I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine. It was luke warm when it got to the table, and the Romano sprinkled on top was only halfway melted and couldn't be mixed in to the sauce. The chicken tasted like it was from a can and was not seasoned. The noodles tasted like styrofoam. The broccoli was still a bit frozen, and the sauce was unimpressive to say the least. The mushrooms were fair. If I hadn't skipped lunch I don't think I would have eaten as much as I did. I paid about $25 including tip, and I expect a bit more than \"sort of okay\" for that kind of money.   All in all I wouldn't go back and certainly wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "**Vegetarian Friendly**  Stopped by after the Ostrich Festival in Chandler because our map had a coupon for free garlic bread! We got to the restaurant only to realize the coupon was expired. The manager, Charlie, honored our coupon since we just came from the event. In fact, Charlie gave us great customer service the entire night, he double checked with us when the bills came to ensure adequate charges.   Most of their entrees qualify as \"three-course meals\" meaning soup/salad, entree and dessert. Why doesn't every restaurant do this?!!  Appetizer: Sicilian Garlic Cheese Bread Excellent blend of three cheeses served with marinara sauce. I personally like my garlic bread on the crunchy side, and this was too soft for my taste.  Three Course Meal: The Managers Favorite - Mizithra Cheese with Browned Butter and Traditional Marina I ordered the salad with the house dressing of basil and ranch. Too much dressing for the salad, but it's up your alley if you're a fan of ranch, if not their house balsamic was just as tasty. The pasta was cooked appropriately to al dente and not watery at all! I wasn't a fan of the mizithra cheese because it felt too dry even with the butter sauce; I think a garlic butter sauce would be a better option. Dessert was a scoop of ice cream, and I mean how could you go wrong? It's the perfect size to round out your meal.   Dessert: Mud Pie Cake Chocolate on chocolate on chocolate. It's rich, so I recommend sharing. You'll probably want a glass of milk to go with it!   I wish they had eggplant parmesan on the menu because they have chicken parmesan. Overall, great restaurant if you're having a strong spaghetti craving!",

You walk in to OSF and you're immediately overcome with that \"old-timey\" stench. The same stench that can be found in thrift stores and your grandmother's moth-balled attic. Albeit, the building has been around for decades, it doesn't need to smell like it.   The service was decent, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food was less than spectacular. The salad that preludes the meal was drenched in dressing, but the bread came out fresh and still very warm. We ordered the lasagna with marinara sauce and manicotti with meat sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and that's where the praise stops. The filling hardly filled either entree and the sauces tasted as if they were poured from Chef Boyardee cans. Absolutely hated the meal. Thank goodness for free refills on the soft drinks, because it took a lot to wash that taste from the taste buds.   Not sure if we'll ever be back to this location. We might give the one in Chandler a chance, but only time will tell.",

I was always able to order tea and switch to a glass of milk with the meal at no extra charge since the drinks are bottomless.  Now even though tea and milk cost the same, and the have always done it, at this location and every other I've been to, this time the manager refused to do it without charging for the milk. So they would reather I buy and drink a half gallon of milk instead of 1 glass of milk and the rest tea for the same price. That makes no sense and is a very poor pricing model.  Now I've learned at lunch unlimited milk is $1 as it always was, but soda pop which costs pennies a glass is $2.98. This is ridiculous in every way and is a kick in the teeth to customers.  Very disappointed at the Iack of logic, the ignorance, and the degree of the lack of consideration for the customer and for customer service in general. Sad and pitiful really.",

    "text": "I am saddened to see the low star reviews of this place. This restaurant has been a staple of Phoenix for so many years and has always offered a piece of Arizona History along with a great meal.  My history started with the Old Spagethii Factory many years ago...when my parents decided that this would be my \"thing\" To do on my birthday. I am so glad that this year marks my 40th birthday celebration at the Factory and I would not give up the history for the world.  The food is always about what it is. My thousand island salad dressing is the favorite over anywhere else and I am pretty simple in my selection of food - rich meat with (1) meatball. Of course it all has to be started off with some awesome cheesy bread!   If you ever have the time to walk in an just inspect the place, you will find all kinds of cool antiques and articles from years past. It's a virtual experience in treasure hunting.  But before you leave, also take the opportunity to ring the bell on the trolley, because you won't find many trolley cars you can eat in!!  Be kind to the businesses that make Phoenix a better place and know that if they didn't live up to a 5 star review, it is the exception and not the rule!",

The upholstery is rad and colorful dark woods, there is also a Spagetti Tree (have to see).. Among other things..      But honestly the food alone.. Will make you moan.",

    "text": "I will preface this review with stating this place is not my favorite restaurant to begin with. I've visited this location about 4-5 times hoping and praying I would have found something new or even something I remotely like.  We visited this location yesterday and there were 4 adults and 1 kid. Checking in was ok, however it took a tad longer than I would have expected for us to be seated. The place was not busy and multiple tables empty and staff standing around doing nothing. We were sat in the Trolley which in itself can offer its own natural experience, however, it did not make up for the horrible service and food. Our server was Andrew, he took our drink orders and left. When he returned with our drinks he did not bring creamer for the coffee. We had to ask 3 separate times for creamer. Another worker finally brought the creamer but the coffee was cold at this point. We asked for a new cup, which we were told after two more times asking for a fresh cup, a new pot is being made. Finally, the fresh cup arrived after our meal was over. What kind of service is this?  In addition to this, we had to ask for refills on other drinks and more bread. These requests were always asked with Please and Thank you, but we had to remind Andrew multiple times. I'm not sure how this place is still surviving with this mediocre service and food. Its unfortunate management has done nothing to address these concerns. Read the reviews its a common trend.  The food is flavorless!  Olive Garden is way better than this place. Maybe its the older cliental that keeps this place in business. Their sense of taste must have left them! Save your money, time and patience's and find a new place to eat. Trust me there are better options available in this great city.   And to the group of management staff standing near the exit doing nothing, maybe you should be going around to the tables and ensuring the guests are having a great experience and seek their feedback. IMPROVE the business!",

I had asked for the meat sauce and they had spooned maybe 2oz onto the top of my plate of pasta. The \"salad\" was just a handful of iceberg mix. I could have bought all of the ingredients at the grocery store for a 1/4th of the cost and a jar of prego would have tasted better. They've been here since the 70s and I don't even know why people still come here.",

Very hard to eat more than a couple bites.  Chicken in my pasta was definitely frozen and looked like rubber.  I'm glad i tried it but i won't come back.  Much better value at  olive garden",

The last time I came I should have known I was going to have a bad experience by the fact that the kitchen manager and floor manager were chit chatting on the floor the entire time I was there.  I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine.  It was possibly the worst pasta dish I have ever had.  The chicken was so dry I could not eat it.  It tasted like it was either boiled, reheated or a little of both.  The cold stale pasta and sauce did little to compliment it, so I picked the broccoli out and that was that.  I wonder how they are teaching servers nowadays because when I was still in the industry and two plates looked untouched we were taught to inquire about what was wrong.  I did not feel the need to complain because as I stated before the manager was obviously too busy hanging out nonchalantly to care about my awful dish.  I would stay away unless you are just of the greedy type that don't mind stale pasta because they will give you a heaping serving for around $10.",

We sent it back being there was nothing on it (caramelized onions) and confused cause it didn't mention meatball, just was supposed to be burger sliders like anyplace you order. We flagged down a manager and him and our server brought back with onions, but insisted that's how it's supposed to be. When leaving, we mention to a different manager (Stefan) and he totally agreed with us. There's a new menu coming, but still not excusable that what we got was definitely not BURGER sliders (no matter how much the other manager,server, and hostess was trying to convince us meatballs are basically the same thing!) Stefan took care of us with offering to give us our money back and a coupon for next time. He saved this trip from us not wanting to come back!",

Aside from some missteps in service, the service was ok. Friendly, but just ok. One dining companion ordered a hearty size portion and got the same size as the rest of us. Same companion also ordered a side of sausage that didn't arrive with the rest of the food either. Server brought him a side of pasta....but he had ordered whole wheat pasta and she brought him regular pasta. Sausage came out a few minutes later.   My spaghetti was salty. The meatballs were salty. The sauce was very very salty. The salad was over-dressed, but the creamy pesto dressing was actually pretty tasty.   Overall, it was eh at best. It's my dining companion's favorite place so we'll likely go back, but not because I really want to. Maybe I can convince him to go to Postino's instead.....I hope. :)",

I loved the decor and always thought that every restaurant should serve spumoni upon completion of a meal, but the romance has since ended now that I am an adult.   In the past year I have found myself here often as a central meeting place that could accommodate a large group. In both of those occasions we had the save server who lacked any ounce of charm in his body and felt way too comfortable with the fact that his gratuity was added into our bill due to size. He was brash and acted annoyed the entire time and despite our size we were pretty low maintenance.   Other than service, the food is doing little to impress me. It has become one of those places where I am never truly satisfied with what I ordered. Because their menu is traditional fare I find myself comparing it to every other Italian place I have been and none of their dishes stand out as the best I have had or even close to it. The portions do not match the price in my opinion and neither does the quality. I just end up walking away from dinner feeling a bit cheated by the entire experience. I wish I could fall in love all over again with this landmark, but it is going to take a lot to win me over.",

I will give it points for a unique interior; I mean it is not very often that you can eat a plate of spaghetti while sitting in a giant velvet throne, but the food is very ho hum. I grabbed dinner there with some friends before heading to a concert in Glendale, the concert was after work, and it was a good middle meeting place.   For being an Italian restaurant, I thought the menu was really limited....nothing really unique, mostly just pasta and sauce combinations. The salad that you get with your meal is just the cheapo iceberg, which is not even worth eating.   Also, they advertise that they can make any of their pastas gluten-free, which excited my sister, but when she tried to order, she was informed that the only gluten-free sauce they have is the tomato, so she went with just a salad, once again, chock full of that icky iceberg lettuce.   There is way better Italian food out there people!",

This is also a very flavorable dish with sausage, chicken and peppers. The sauce is blended and  comes on a large bed of spagehetti. The entree is good but not the best Italian I have had.

It's nearly unheard of to see an Italian restaurant (non-chain, chain, authentic or not) have a gluten free option. +1, seriously.  I've always liked the Spaghetti Factory. It's not the best but it is dirt cheap and they have so many cool decorations. I'm a sucker for old antique-y looking stuff.   The service can be slow and it's always busy, but hell...ALL Spaghetti Factories are this busy if not more. It's not an anomaly people.

We arrived probably around 1:20 p.m. and the lunch rush was over; if it had one.  The young lady took the name and said it will be about ten minutes, ok no big deal. This gave me time to look around again for the first time. The building and the decor is tired and uninviting. It could be really nice if it tried.  Ok so this is not fine dining I know that, I accept this.  Our server was Cory; he did a fine job with a very pleasant attitude.   I ordered what was recommended to me by two folks; the Mizithra Cheese and Brown Butter. It is said to be a toothsome treat for cheese lovers. What in Gods name does that mean I have no idea? Nor do I know why a cheese lover would love this dish. I also ordered a salad and cup of soup. Clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name. I beg, please do not give me a wet salad, dry the veggies first and then serve them. As for the toothsome treat it self, well no. Bruce looked over and said; man that looks dry is it missing something? I would not know since I have never had it before, but I do know if this is a favourite dish of anyone they have very low standards in food.  I like good food; I want good food even in a middle of the road place like this. Find inspiration and pass it along to your patrons. I mean if I am going to remain fat I want it to mean something.....",

    "text": "\"The Old Spaghetti Factory\" was probably one of the first restaurants my wife and I ate at when we started dating.  Money was tight back then and TOSF soon became one of our favorite eats.  I hate to compare this place to a fast food restaurant, but this place is like the \"McDonald's\" of Italian food.  Now let me explain that.  When you go to McDonald's, it doesn't matter where in the country, or in the world, you are, when you order a cheeseburger, you know what you are going to get.  It's consistent and it's inexpensive.  The same can be said for TOSF.   It's decent quality Italian food, at very fair prices.    I've sampled many things on the menu over the years, but lately I always get the same thing when we go out for dinner; Spaghetti and Meatballs.  I know most people wouldn't think to order something that you can make at home out, but I like a good meat sauce and my wife would rather have marinara.  So, for me, it's a treat.  She adores the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and brown butter, although, last night she ordered the meatloaf and said she found a new favorite dish.  I'll have to try it next time.  I'm usually the one that goes for the \"soul food\".  Dinner is usually served with a salad, and their creamy pesto dressing (similar to a ranch) is really amazing.  Remember to save a little room for desert, because you always get your choice of a scoop of ice cream, spumoni, or sherbet afterwards.  TOSF is definitely kid friendly.  It is a True family restaurant.  The trolley car in the middle of the restaurant is always a draw with the little ones.  There can be a wait sometimes.  Call ahead and put your name on the list, since they don't take reservations.  The 1980's era arcade games are great to pass the time and bring back many memories of wasted quarters of my youth.  TOSF is one of those places that will always leave you full of good food and great memories...even if it is a chain.",

In my cabinet is an entire set of the old ones. Now they have newer ones.  There is a slight wait to be seated (at least during Mon-Thursday early evening hours, when I usually go), but they have old arcade games to play while you do so. The food was served quickly.

While the portion sizes went lower and the prices went up, the quality of the food seems to have dropped as well as the expertise of cooking it.    The Chicken Parm that I got was pathetic to say the least.  It was a tiny little piece of chicken breast and was dry as a bone.  The side of spaghetti was even small.  It almost looked like a children's portion as they set the plate in front of me.    My wife and Dad both got the Mizithra Cheese...portion sizes were VERY noticeable between the 2 (She got a LOT more).  Sometimes you you get the Mitzithra Cheese with WAY more than you need...sometimes you get a lot less.    Service:  Well, it wasn't the best.  It took 20 minutes for anyone to come to the table...I had to go to the hostess and tell her that it's been 20 minutes and no one has even stopped by our table at all.  Once she showed up, it wasn't completely horrible.  The Old Spaghetti Factory used to be one of those places where you can go and meet up with the family for lunch/dinner and have good food as well as walk out of there full.  Their food used to be excellent and not taste like it came out of a microwave...or pre-cooked in bags like the Olive Garden.",

The mizithra cheese however is so good, the chicken marsala, amazing and flavorful, and the tuscan chicken sandwich (only available at lunch time) very craveable.  Most of the salad dressing are made on site, and while I personally am a fan of the bleu cheese, most of my friends go for the creamy pesto.  The bread is delivered fresh daily and once upon a time long long ago when I served tables here for a short time a small loaf of bread was my nightly dinner and quite satisfying.  Because I worked here I can also tell you the kitchen staff back then was always terrific and the whole place very clean.  The price and atmosphere make this a simple and enjoyable place to grab dinner with friends...or sit with your date in the trolly.  For the small prices to get soup or salad, a drink, bread, dinner and a scoop or spumoni, what more can you ask for?  Another notable fact: the location is actually ranked as one of the top haunted places in AZ.  When I worked there the power went out one night and i swear to you we could hear footsteps up in the attic!",

The food is hit or miss and they took eggplant off the menu and i do have to say that was my favorite thing to get there. But the building is so beautiful and inside is so many eye catching things to look at. and they have a trolley inside as well, so the kids would love that. The service is AMAZING, i would give them a rating of 5 stars on that part, friendly, always around and quick. The prices are not bad either, your meal comes with a drink, salad or soup and dinner and dessert all included. i pretty much never get the dessert their portions are big. They do have a bar as well but it is not put to good use as i see it, it is in the back of the restaurant and they have never tried to make it a place to just go hang out and have drinks, too bad because it is pretty cool area. There is rumor that the building is haunted and that they do have ghosts in there, so keep your eyes and ears open!! It is just a warm beautiful place to go with friends, family or a date!!",

    "text": "This place has been here in this location forever. I remember coming here as a kid when it was called \"The Spaghetti Company\" and regarding it as a major treat. The restaurant is housed in what looks like somebody's house on the corner of Central and McDowell, (and I always thought it was.) The interior is cavernous and museum-like, with old Victorian-era photographs, bookshelves, hidden rooms, chandeliers, and antiques on the walls. There's even a trolley cable car in the middle of the place where you can sit in and eat. As a child, I thought this was the coolest place ever. My brother and I would even go off and \"explore\" the restaurant when we finished our meals.  So, this place definitely has nostalgia for me. I always thought it was a unique, special place and that the people that were in the photographs lived in there at one point and now probably haunted the restaurant from the hidden upstairs level (how do you get up there?! There must be a hidden staircase somewhere...)  But then my young, naive little mind discovered the existence of a little thing called a \"chain restaurant.\" \"Wait, so you mean there's ANOTHER Spaghetti Factory? In Fresno?! I thought this was the only one? I thought it was a Phoenix thing?\" I wasn't sure what to make of that fact. I felt a little bit betrayed, as a matter of fact. Maybe it wasn't as magical and old as I thought. Regardless, the building it has occupied for the past twenty (thirty?) years has real charm and history, and I'm glad it's home to the Spaghetti Factory, and not a Cricket phone paycenter.   The food isn't really anything special. Honestly, it's rather forgettable. But then again, I was always more focused on finding the secret book that would open the trapdoor than on my lasagna. I haven't ever had a terrible experience with service or the food, but it's certainly nothing to rave about. I came here the other weekend with some friends and we had a good time; had nothing to complain about. The portions are rather small, however.   Now that it's directly across from the lightrail maybe I will stop by if I'm in the area. It will always have a sort of nostalgic status in my mind, but I have to say, I love the OSF of 1991the best.",

My parent's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant.  Once a place got introduced into our dining lives, we went there every week until my dad got pissed off for some odd reason, and we would move on to a different establishment.  Needless to say we ate at Spaghetti Factory many, many, many times.  I have some fond memories from this place.  Fast forward to now, many years later, I learn they have gluten-free pasta.  1 3/4 hours after finding this out, I was sitting at a table ordering gluten-free pasta with meat sauce and sausage.  I was not disappointed.  They use a corn pasta that has a very good consistency and has a very good taste... my non-gf dining partner also ordered it and enjoyed it very much.  The meat sauce was fantastic in a super salty, not healthy kind of way and the sausage... oh the sausage, so good.  Now I realize this place is in no way healthy, authentic, or \"italian\", but it's a guilty pleasure that many will like.  I especially like the prices and the decor inside, just like it was when I was a kid.  I enjoy this place, for the memories, and now for the gluten-free pasta.  This will be a monthly place for me before first-fridays.  I highly recommend you use their call ahead seating option by phoning in before you come, it will greatly reduce your wait times.",

    "text": "So everything on their menu apparently is a \"fresh sauce\" but it's all premade. So if you don't like unions like myself, then oh well, that's half their menu. After going through 5 different dishes I couldn't get because \"simmered in fresh onions\" is apparently also a sauce, I finally settled on the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Mind you this a $17 dollar plate. As someone to cooks on a regular basis, I could immediately tell the shrimp were microwaved. So I gave it a try and sure enough it was microwaved with garlic salt on top. It was like eating shrimp and garlic flavored rubber. The pasta looked like they cooked noodles and added canned fettuccine Alfredo sauce. Hardly worth $17 in my opinion. The only good thing there was how nice the waitress was. She was running two very large parties and dealing with me, so I felt bad so I tipped her really well. But I won't be going back there. There's nothing \"fresh\" about that place.",

It's dingy, dark, and tacky. The food doesn't really bring anything new to the \"Hey we're an Italian place that totally doesn't use a microwave for 90% of our cooking,\" scene. The portion sizes are huge, but with the majority of the actual entrees being pasta, it's hard to see why the prices are $14+ per plate.  Both times we've been, (with a large party, admittedly) it's taken a super long time for us to get our checks. Really, look elsewhere for lunch or dinner.",

The wait time on a Saturday night was fairly short and overall the ambience was great. I loved the unique furniture and the fact that all the dining tables and chairs were different. From there though the rest went pretty downhill. Our server was nice but we honesty only saw her when she took our order and when she dropped the check. Someone else brought our appetizer and salads out. One of my biggest pet peeves is dirty, finished plates crowding my table and the photo I attached sums up our visit. We never received refills, no one prebussed our table, and we were never asked how our food tasted. We even struggled to catch her attention so we could finally cash out at the end of our visit. The food was decent but given the lack of customer service we won't be back.",

I came here on a Sunday afternoon.... it was after a Diamondback game and it was Father's Day so it was a pretty long wait, but that's my fault for not making reservations. I ordered the ravioli and spaghetti combo. Both were amazing, and after I finished that I was just about stuffed. It came with bread, a nice salad, and ice cream. I chose the chocolate cherry pistachio flavor and wow was it good. It was about $50 for me and my dinner companion who ordered the Alfredo which was also very good.

Between 3 of us the order was spaghetti, manicotti, Caesar salad and cheese bread. The salad looked crisp and fresh but it was void of any flavor. I seriously think they forgot the dressing because it simply tasted like lettuce. The manicotti was good but nothing special and the spaghetti was average as well. And why do I always have to ask for bread plates? That's a peeve of mine.

This is actually a disclaimer up front so when you start pointing out every wrong with it.

By the way, when are you getting the ceiling painted?  Salad: drenched in dressing, almost asked for more lettuce for my dressing.  No stars Dinner: Chicken Piccata. 1 Star, way too much Oil's in my Pasta and Chicken.   Service: 2 Star/ Once you have been served they \"poof\" vanish...  That's all I got, way too much to point out.  It's the Old Factory and you come for cheap food, bus stop feel food court and the small dish of ice cream that once you eat it you will forget everything that went wrong while you were in here.  Like that cookie on the Matrix.   The best thing about this place is that they provide jobs and as long as we continue to come in and leave high expectations at the door this place will continue to be here and hopefully change there name to \"The Really Old Old Spaghetti Factoria\"  Managers I commend you because you must turn many fires off in this place.  Gotta say during my visit you guys were running around the most.  Keep it up and maybe some of these bad servers should thank you that they still have a job.

I'm hoping this yelp will enable them to fix the dish so it taste like it used to it's always been my favorite and I hope it stays my favorite. Other than that I would recommend going to visit this place but please fix the  Mizithra cheese spaghetti so everyone else can enjoy it the way it's supposed to taste.  Also, if you fix it people will come back for more.

First, the plate became not so big, then the pasta was not as tasty, and the price was not as reasonable as it used to be.  At my most recent visit, a normal visit with me and my family consisted of three mediocre meals.  The salad was lousy, the meatballs too greasy, and the sauce inferior to what you find in many jars at the supermarket.  $80 with tip--really?    I'm not the only person to write a review as of late that is similar to this.  OSF, are you listening?  You had a good thing, and you are losing it.  You spent all that money renovating the exterior of the restaurant, and the quality of the food suffers.  Not good.  Not worth it anymore.",

    "text": "Caveat: This critique is only for the visit today, 01/14/19. Usually, this restaurant does not disappoint - I believe my experience today was quite outside the norm.  Also, kudos to Shayna for her service and desire to help make our experience better. She was fab.  The problem: We arrived around 5 PM for dinner, the restaurant was not busy. However, there was no hostess at the desk and after some waiting, we had to seek her out elsewhere in the restaurant. Well, things happen and it's fine and dandy but probably not how the GM would like his restaurant represented.   The bread at the table hot and fresh (thanks, Shayna!).  We waited quite awhile for food, 45 mins or so. We weren't in a rush so, meh, ok. But the food arrived cold. My broccoli was cold. Chicken was cold. Sauce was lukewarm. This was the case around the table. Shayna collected the meals immediately and rang in New orders.  We waited, again, for quite awhile.   Our re- do arrived via the manager, Gabby. While she went to grab a few more things, we discovered that the food, again, was lukewarm. Luckily my sauce was hot and I was able to warm my dish.  Upon her return, we told Gabby that the food was again not hot. Without apology or any kind of acknowledgement, all she said (in a very snotty manner) was, \"Well, its up to temp.\" We explained that this was impossible considering our meals were NOT warm. She could have cared less. Again no apology or explanation (we were hoping the warmers weren't on the fritz or something) and we never heard from her again.   Shayna did her best to check in, fill our glasses, etc.   We received the check ( full price) Again, ok. But WOW. We weren't expecting anything, BUT another check in from the manager would have been nice. I'm sorry, but, if you are unable to provide hospitality, don't be in the service industry.   So again, not the typical experience for this restaurant, but also unacceptable.",

Finally got a chance to visit this location and I did not expect such a neat decor. It felt like I was back in time, 70-80s?? It was just not what I expected (in a good way). The place is HUGE!!! Great for large parties and lots of pasta options. We started with a shared Caesar salad which was HUGE + very delicious. For my entree I chose the combo where you can pick 2 different sauces or pastas of your choice. I ordered spaghetti with alfredo and also with the mushrooms in red sauce. The mushroom/red sauce was better than expected, the alfredo was lacking but I still enjoyed my meal and service. Their bread is pretty good too! I love it's served fresh and warm. Our server was attentive, not the friendliest but she was always there when we needed anything and checked on us often. We will definitely be back. I'd heard the food is good but the service isn't always the best, overall better than I originally expected. p.s the cheesecake was pretty good!",

After we walked in we waited for about five minutes before anyone showed up at the front desk to check us in. We were told that it would be ten to fifteen minutes to get a table. After ten minutes we were led to a table and noticed that the place was not at all busy. After waiting for about another ten minutes our orders were taken at 1:30 PM. Drinks and bread were brought to the table at 1:37. We had to go and get straws from the bar. Apple sauce for two kids meals was brought to the table at 1:40 (but no entree). Salad for one adult meal arrived at 1:54, 24 minutes after our orders were taken. We asked for more bread at 1:54 and it arrived quickly. We asked for more bread at 2:03. Food finally arrived at 2:05. At 2:18 we had to remind the waitress that the kids meals included ice cream which arrived at 2:23.  I had the Grilled Chicken Panini. It was supposed to have sauce on it but it was quite dry.",

Sat down and asked about Italian soda.  I said what are they?  She said there are 15 do I really have to tell you all of them?  I said no, just wondering what they were.  She said soda and cream.  So my husband asked if there was one that was a \"favorite\".  She said there are 7 and still wouldn't tell us what they were.  Ok past that.   Now on to lunch.  We all ordered and she brought out our drinks, salads, bread and soup.  When lunch arrived we asked for another loaf of bread (had only had 1) and she says I will bring it but it's $1.50 for every loaf you have.  one of my daughters had unlimited soup, salad and bread for lunch.  Hmmmm.  So I went up front and asked when that became a thing because in the past 20 years I have NEVER been charged for a second loaf of bread.  They said only a thing with to go orders!!!!!  Clearly we were not to go!!!!  Anyway she had a HUGE chip on her shoulder and we will not be back!!!!  Wasn't going to let it ruin my daughters birthday but it certainly was a downer.  I understand we all have bad days but in the service industry you can't let it show!!!",

When they walked us back there were empty tables everywhere.  We soon discovered why there was a wait...not enough waiters!  From start to finish at this restaurant we spent a total of two hours and 10 minutes.  The service was extremely slow and the food was mediocre.  My MIL's dish was cold.  My dish stated that it came with broccoli...it failed to state that it only came with two florets.  Definitely not enough to satisfy my broccoli fix.  Our waiter was friendly but not attentive.

So, don't except what you had in Rome, when in Phoenix, this is where it's at.  With less Yelp food photos than photos of the restaurant, you know it's a cool place. They sat us in the stationary/makeshift train in the middle of the restaurant. Even though it was Happy Hour and that was only available at the bar, we were content in our super cool seats.   It was a pleasant surprise to see Makers Mark featured in their star cocktails, including the Old Fashioned. Although I can't say it was anywhere near the best Old Fashioned I've ever had, this ain't Kentucky and I must give them credit for effort.   I was torn on whether to order the clam cream spaghetti of ravioli and so was my friend, so I ordered the Gourmet Crab Stuffed Ravioli and she ordered the Pot Pouiri. I wasn't a huge fan of the clam sauce based spaghetti, so luckily she was completely content with her entire order and raved about it the entire trip back to train ride back to Tempe. The ravioli was excellent, but could've used a tad more sauce and wasn't as large of an order than I'd expected.",

We got there and it was relatively busy which was to be expected for dinner time. We waited for about 30 minutes to get a table and that was totally fine. We knew there would be a wait. When we did get our table we ordered a bottle of wine for the table and our meals. We didn't see the server again until after our food had already been dropped off. So we had gotten our food but still hadn't gotten our drinks about half way through finishing our food he comes over and asks what bottle we ordered again and then left. About 15 minutes later the manager Gabby came over with the bottle and when we simply said we were already done with our food and didn't want the wine anymore she rudely rolled her eyes, didn't say a single word and turned around and walked away.  I have never in my life been treated like that by anyone at a restaurant let alone by a manager! We did ask her as she was walking away for some more water and she shouted she would let our server know as she was walking away.  I don't know how long Gabby has been a manager at this place but she should definitely be demoted back to the bottom so she can learn something about customer service and how to be a good human. I won't be going back to this location. I'd rather drive to Scottsdale then ever be treated like that again.",

Being students in college, we try to not eat a lot of expensive restaurants to say the least ha ha. But anyways, the restaurant itself is decorated really nicely. There kind of an old saloon theme going on which I thought was pretty cool. The food was also good, nothing too special but it wasn't bad. My roommate and I both got pasta which to our surprise was apart of their three course meal. It includes a soup/ salad, the entree, and ice cream. Considering how much food I had plus my drink, my bill was under $20 and that's pretty cheap to me! The reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because the food was pretty average and we were also sat next to this ceiling high stack of barrels that kind of isolated us from the entire restaurant. Personally, I like being able to look out at the rest of the restaurant and see what's going on, so this table wasn't my cup of tea. However, if you're in the mood for Italian, you should try this place out!",

[I truly respect his opinion on eating out]. But my bestie Jason and I were meeting a few friends to attend an N2T production and this was the closest open restaurant on the light rail.  Yeah, this is a chain and probably a step above Olive Garden. But what impressed me was the Garlic Mizithra:  Brow butter. Mizithra cheese. Garlic. Bacon. Especially the bacon; I'm a sucker for bacon. Not only did I eat the entire bowl of pasta, after digging into the wonderful sourdough bread and putting a serious dent in the tapenade, I left wearing some memorable stains from the butter. Meh, that's why I brought a scarf.  While I cannot say I'd add this to my regular rotation, I wouldn't not return.",

We grew up, went to college and got married and started taking our kids there.  They both married tgeir high school sweethearts and this restaurant has become special to them too!

I ended up giving this place two stars as the setting is fun and the old street car is really cool. Too bad you have to have less than 4 people to sit in it.",

I always ate at the location in Fullerton and New Port Beach both in California and when I found this one in Phoenix I was thrilled.   The service, however, wasn't too great. We sat at a very awkward table behind a pillar in the restaurant and did not even get acknowledged until about 10 minutes of sitting there. We simply ordered 2 waters and cheesy garlic bread to start and the bread came out before our waters. The service the rest of night was extremely slow and there was a crowd of guests being extremely rude and obnoxious the entire night.   I will go back because I love the food so much and you get a lot to eat, but the service needs some work.",

In the 1940s, the Coles bought the Baker house, and combined the two houses into one.  In the 1970s, the Barrow family bought this structure, and turned it into the \"Spaghetti Company,\" and was in business until the mid 1990s, when it was sold to the current owners of the Italian restaurant chain, The Old Spaghetti Factory.  Local Phoenix legend has it that the place is haunted.  In any event, the building itself is worth the visit to see.  It is almost like a museum with all the memorabilia on the walls, and the huge trolley in the middle of the place.  As for the food, I really like their pasta and marinara sauce, and they have great bread and sausage.",

    "text": "So yesterday my boyfriend and I decided to try this place for the first time and definitely the last time. We ordered the bread and toasted ravioli for appetizers.. the bread was undercooked and just dripping in in grease, and the toasted ravioli tasted like it was frozen and put into a microwave.  Then our salad comes out, and I've never complained about a damn salad before at a restaurant but this was AWFUL. The lettuce just tasted like it's been sitting outside the fridge for days and it had barely any dressing at all.  After this we waited a WHOLE HOUR for our food.. Mind you other people around us getting their food, tables of 7 even that came in AFTER us. We sat there just about ready to get our check and leave until it finally shows up. And wow!!! What a huge disappointment!! My boyfriend and I both looked at each other and thought the same thing! \"I'm paying $17.00 for a plate of that?!?\" Literally maybe a SCOOP of spaghetti with a pathetic side of chicken is what they call chicken Parmesan. I ordered the crab ravioli and it was cold, looked like it was thrown together and sat for an hour. I'm sorry but if we're going to pay almost for a $100 meal for two, I want to get my moneys worth and this was something that I could have bought in the frozen section at Walmart if I wanted too.  The manager comes over and proceeds to tell us we got \"pushed behind\" and large banquet they were having that's why it took so long and she made it seem like that was our fault and or our problem? Also tells us that the food is already pre-portioned which basically means its portioned out and frozen.  All I can say is was a huge disappointment, we were looking forward to this and it was supposed to be my birthday celebration/date night and it just turned out to be a huge waste of time.  I will tell people to stay away unless they want to spend a fortune on freezer food.",

Service is spotty, sometimes it's fast, other times it's slow.  The food is similar. I had the \"Unlimited soup and Salad\" ($7) for lunch. The salad was a disappointment, it seemed like it came out of a bag. The in-house dressings were great, but did not redeem that salad. The soup was also a disappointment, it was minestrone and it did not taste fresh. The bread that came with it was the same as the previous 2 items, it was a sad sourdough baguette. It didn't even look appetizing.  My second visit was slightly better, I had ordered the \"Garlic Shrimp Fettuccine\" (nearing $20), everything was wonderful except for the shrimp, they were extremely tough and rubbery.   When there are authentic Italian places nearby like Forno 301, or Pomo Pizzeria, you really can skip this place. I will reiterate that it really is beautiful so while I might not come back for Italian food, I will definitely come back for drinks at their bar.",

Tonight they messed up my daughter's and my meal (they didn't give us the gluten free we requested) and had to remake it.  By the time they brought it back my husband was mostly done with his dinner.  (Super disappointing as it was our anniversary dinner.). Our drinks also did not come until after the appetizer was served.  Drinks were also not refilled in any timely manner.  My chicken dish tasted bad and I had to send back.  We often get frustrated with the service here, but tonight was the topper.    Spaghetti factory you have good food, but you REALLY need a stronger management presence.  In the 30+ years we've been coming here a manager has NEVER touched our table to ask how our food was, etc.  (I used to be a restaurant manager, so this is super disappointing.). It often seems servers are in the corner chatting, etc and not watching their tables.    We will be looking for another restaurant for anniversary's, birthdays, and dinners.  So disappointed that one of my favorite restaurants I've been coming to for almost 30 years is not of the quality it used to be.  :(.   Please go back to the service and quality you used to be.",

We were staying in Phoenix and since we made the 14 hour drive, we didn't feel like going out. After reading many reviews stating that the portions were huge and the food was awesome, I placed an order for a spaghetti dinner and a lasagna dinner. The order took 45 mins to deliver and the cost was a staggering $50.   First, the salad came in the smallest Chinese food container and it was just plain salad mix from a bag. Nothing else added. This was a $50 meal for two and the salad was exactly like the bagged salad mix I buy at Walmart for $1.39 a bag. The two entrees tasted ok, and only ok. In addition, the size was a total joke. It came in a round disposable tin that was the size of my hand; not a large portion but a child size portion size. The bread they sent was awesome, but the rest of the experience was a serious disappointment.",

When we checked in at the host stand, we were told the wait was going to be about 40-45 minutes.  There were about 7 small groups sitting inside, so I found that a little strange.  So I asked if we could order at the bar. The employee said if the bartenders weren't too busy that we might be able to order an appetizer, but that it wasn't guaranteed to do even that.    We ended up ordering our food to go. The employee who helped us with picking up our food was pleasant.  When we got home, the portions were tiny compared to what I've had at the restaurant.  I've never finished my food when dining in.  In this case I finished everything and was still a little hungry.  The tiny Chinese food container had like a scoop of salad and a separate sauce container with 5 croutons.   Disappointing visit and not sure I will feel positive about this brand anymore. :(",

    "text": "So last night my wife and I came here to meet with our family for my Father-in-Laws birthday extravaganza!  We had made reservations for 7pm and our whole party(8) arrived by 6:45pm.  My wife and I got there at 6:30pm to make sure we confirmed the reservation that we put in earlier in the week.    We sat in the waiting area just outside the bar and we noticed that there was a table for about 10 people that needed to be cleared.  I told my family that it was going to be our table because it made the most since.  45 minutes later at 7:30pm We inquired about our reservation and about 2 minutes later they started clearing said table.    After sitting at the recently cleaned table for about 15 minutes, a waiter came by, asked us if we'd been helped, and sadly we had not.  A few minutes later the bar waitress came and helped us.  She was fantastic, she stayed on top of our order and let the evening progress smoothly.  Had it not been for her, this birthday extravaganza would have been a complete loss.    By the end of the evening my in-laws were happy anew.    My wife and my family have been coming here for years, we even looked for the Spaghetti Tree.    The waitress was great but overall this is my most disappointing trip to the Spaghetti Factory.",

We both ordered the lunch specials chicken parmigiana sandwich.  The bread was not toasted, not much sauce a little cheese and the plate potato chips. The chips were stale. The chicken was cold the sandwich was dry.  My wife a quarter of the sandwich, I eat the chicken with the sauce.   Told the waitress about the chips and the sandwich, she replied \"I don't know about the chips, as they don't let me eat them all day.

Swap the carby pasta for broccoli ($2 extra)!   I know what you're thinking, broccoli isn't as good as pasta! And you're not wrong. But if you try to eat broccoli thinking it's pasta, you're kinda dumb. If you eat broccoli knowing it's broccoli, you'll be really impressed by how it carries the brown butter and how the mizithra texture shines. I'm so excited that I can order this as a side for take out, or go to dinner with my non-keto husband and still feel really happy.   Btw, that pesto salad dressing is amazing.",

    "text": "When you read reviews about The Old Spaghetti Factory, it seems that many people have fond memories of going here when they were younger, only to now discover that it's either went downhill, or perhaps was never really all that good to begin with.  I had only been here once, which was over three years ago and had never developed the urge to go back until recently. And while their knack for renovating old buildings definitely has its charm, I feel that OSF isn't really much more than just your usual franchise Italian food that is mostly on par with what you'd receive at Olive Garden.  The ever-so-popular mizithra cheese and brown butter is something that always tastes good on the first bite, but eventually, the cheese and more so, the butter, become so incredibly overpowering that I find it extremely difficult to finish. I ordered an extra meatball just to try them, which was just average, but cold.  Traditional spaghetti is just okay, using mostly bland sauce. Their whole three-course meal approach is nice, enabling you to receive a loaf of warm, but somewhat salty bread, as well as a soup or salad. Salad is pretty basic, similar to what you might receive at a place like Texas Roadhouse.  The ice cream is fine. Last time we came, spumoni was the only option, which I don't really like. This time, we were offered three options between vanilla, sherbet, and spumoni.  The food is cheap in comparison to a lot of places and the portions are pretty large, although some report that they were even larger in previous years. But despite this, that's not really enough to really earn them any more than a very generous two stars.  If you dig chain food made in bulk and just like eating in large quantities, then I'm sure you'll like it. But if you're aware of what other pasta options we have in Phoenix, then you obviously know why this would never be a top choice for most of the well-informed locals in Central Phoenix.",

Old folks abound, perhaps reassured by the gimmicky old tyme nostalgia, with the trolley, fake tiffany lamps, etc. Instead, it transports me to the 1970s, to sprawling east coast chains off the turnpike I'd get dragged to as a kid - with waits, bland food, very young staff going thru the motions, and crap on the walls to distract from the underlying mediocrity.   It's not horrible, and will appeal to that handful of Americans actually older than me, but I've little interest recapturing the sleepy era this factory is shooting for.",

I get that working the lunch shift may not be lucrative, but yesterday I was with a group of approximately 15 and our waiter was incredibly rude and disinterested in serving us. He was banking on the fact that he would get an automatic 18% from each of us, which is unfortunate because for good service I will tip more. Beyond the lousy service, the food is not good. I had the fettucini alfredo the first time I ate at OSF and it was drowning in alfredo sauce...yuck. The salad looks like something you get from a bag. Yesterday I ordered a caesar salad as my entree. First, it had tomatoes in it. I really don't like tomatoes in caesar salad. Second, our waiter brought it out with the other salads. So that meant that when my group got their entrees, I had nothing and basically had to watch them eat. Since when were entree salads brought out with starter salads??? Lastly the wine selection is pathetic. There are only two white wines by the glass and the Riesling I had yesterday was much too sweet.   For generic Italian food, go to the Olive Garden. At least their salad and breadsticks are decent.",

The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :(",

From California to Washington where we frequented the Seattle and Tacoma locations for years and on to Phoenix, I have always been satisfied. Where else can you go for decent Italian at their prices. The food is consistently fine, although I am embarrassed to admit that I have never ordered anything other than the \" Meat Lovers Special\" after all these years. Just spaghetti with marinara and a couple of meatballs and Italian sausage. try it, it's great. The wife always orders the spinach tortellini with Alfredo and the kids order off the kids menu. The atmosphere, although varying from location to location is enjoyable. The kids love sitting in the trolley, give it a shot. maybe I am not saying much, but it beats the Olive Garden any day of the week. The service can be spotty, but keep the bread coming and I am happy. Went recently for my 9 year olds B Day dinner ( His Request ) and we all had a great time. The service was excellent and the meal ended with a complimentary piece of cake for my boy and enthusiastic singing from the staff. What more could you ask for. Great job OSF !",

    "text": "We always make bets on the way to the Spaghetti Factory whether or not the service is going to be crappy or not.  Sometimes it's great; sometimes it's downright awful.  But that mizithra cheese keeps us coming back for more.     We got there at 7pm on a Sunday night.  There were a few girls working at the front desk and one of them asks how many are in our party.  We tell her '3' and then she disappears.  Minutes go by.  I think her shift might have ended and she took off.  Who knows.  So now another girl asks us how many and then tells us it'll be 10 minutes.  I can sense that my fiance is getting irritated so I remind him that this was his idea.  We go sit down to wait.  Not even two minutes go by and they call us.  I don't know where they learned how to estimate time, but at least it was in our favor.  Everything else went off without a hitch; the food was delicious (you gotta know what to order though---we always order the same thing...chicken marsala with the mizithra cheese spaghetti and the eggplant parm) and our server brought applesauce and milk for our toddler.  Which reminds me-- it's a great family place; we are always relieved to be at a place where there are other kids and babies being noisy.  Less chance of us being the ones making the scene or anyone noticing our toddler flinging her applesauce off the spoon.  Sorry to the people sitting next to us, by the way.  In summary--it's good, it's cheap, it's a classic, it's family friendly; it's weird; the service is spotty, but in the end...we'll go back.",

It was too scrumptious and can be dangerous after a few. **DRINKER BEWARE**  The environment is cool, very 50's furnishings, there is a sleigh in one of the front windows.........not sure what the meaning is behind that. Also you have to check out the Pasta Farming Paraphernalia  Parking can be a little hectic as well",

You get plenty of food, soup or salad, your entree and desert for a decent price. Of course, this isn't authentic Italian food or anything, just really good pasta. The interior is rustic, lots of seating and room in this hardwood floored refurbished old house. The decorations are old family photos and playbills. But be warned, don't expect to be in and out in an hour for lunch. Service is slow for whatever reason. I learned after a few times that an hour and a half was the norm for lunch.",

Even with this I still would come bringing my family trying to relive my happy childhood  memories.  So on Saturday  4/11/2015 my family  and I drove the 25 miles to get there and when we arrive there was a few families  waiting. I checked our family  in at 5pm for a party of 7 and the hostess stated it will be a 45 min wait. I agreed and as 5:45 came around my dad went to check to see if they ready for us. He came back and stated that they told him another 15 minutes. As we are waiting the restaurant  starts filling up and we notice many families  that came after us were being seated. At 6:00 pm I went to check to see much longer and the hostess looked at the clipboard and stated it will be another 20 mins. I couldn't believe it, and what was worse there were names below mine that were highlighted off because they have been seated. The hostess stated that they had reservations and we should have called since our party was so big. I requested a manager and one came out and i expressed my issue but the manager whose name is not even worth mentioning gave a heartless apology and stated it will be another  20 minutes.  With that I thanked him for his time grabbed my family and walked out. So friendly tip if you have a party of 7 or more call in for a reservation otherwise  prepare to wait.",

So to say this place had the worst food, trust me it was that bad. My friend commented on the lasagna that it didn't even taste as good as Stouffers frozen. The Chicken Marsala I ordered was so tough, I couldn't even cut it! I definitely could have done 100 times better. The atmosphere is great, but the service doesn't support such a cool looking restaurant. I'm not sure how long it took to get a glass of wine and beer from the waiter but it semed like forever! There is no parking in the front so you have to drive around to the back which is a tad unsavory honestly. How do you mess up Italian food THAT bad?? Really! Go somewhere else. Do not take anyone but your kids here and order something like spaghetti and meatballs!! Then cross your fingers!",

We arrived at about  7:15PM, finding the parking lot almost full (usually a good sign). We checked in with the hostess and were told we would be seated in a few minutes. Shortly thereafter we were seated at a table in  the main thoroughfare. Not a huge problem, but things got worse from there. Our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly. We all ordered our meals with the minestrone soup. We were offered bread and it was nice and hot. The server told us on two occasions that they ran out of soup, but more was on the way and offered us a salad instead (should have taken her up on that offer). The meals came and still no soup. We were offered more bread and then were told they ran out of that too. I had spaghetti with meat sauce and my wife and son had chicken Parmesan. We all felt the spaghetti was tasteless and the chicken was rubbery. The soup finally came after we were done with our meals and in our opinion was inedible. All in all a very disappointing meal. The prices here a similar to most Italian chain restaurants. I personally will never go to this chain again",

    "text": "Underwhelming experience to say the least.  I met several friends for a birthday here, Saturday night. We reserved for a party of 8, ended up being a table of 13 by the time we ordered any food. ALL of the party has worked in restaurants or customer service so we knew that because of the party size service may be a little slow, being in no hurry this wasn't a problem. The restaurant was, at best, less than 2/3 full the entire time we were there the (room nearest us wasn't even open).  None of our food came out together,  bread came as half of the party was finishing,  a few drinks came from the bar after all of the checks had been paid. I don't blame the poor service all on our server, the food runners had no idea what any of the food was and were baffled by requests for pepper and Parmesan cheese. The food it self was less that great, my blue cheese dressing had no flavor and seemed watered down, no one in he group that had Alfredo sauce liked it (tasted jarred) and everything was so smothered in grated cheese it was hard to taste anything beyond it. The Birthday girl and her husband were the only ones of the group that had been there before. We chose this spot for price, atmosphere and location. On an upside they did have a great atmosphere and good prices. My check for 2 was about $40 including the added gratuity. Maybe an off night? I probably won't go back to find out.",

But I always get the sensation that if it were a little easier to make an unsatisfactory pasta dish (I'm not too picky with the basics), they might do it here.   I've eaten here many, many times and have never walked away disappointed or let down, but I think the trick is that this is one of the first Italian restaurants I ever went to. I can't even tell you how many birthday parties in the trolley I attended and came home with spumoni caked on the front of my Hypercolor t-shirt.   Now, having been to a few more restaurants of all varieties, I can unquestionably say that food here is not bad nor good, but it's great if you're a six year old who doesn't know the difference.   Post Script/N.B.* My girlfriend has informed me that if you call ahead for a kids' pasta meal, you can get a healthy portion of pasta, side salad, loaf of bread, and a carton of milk for $4. Be advised, they may look at you funny when you pick up your meal, unless you are indeed a child rather than a starving college student, in which case you shouldn't have a problem.",

This time we placed our order, received our drinks, ate our dinner salads, and then (a full 30 minutes after we placed the order) the server informed me that they were out of gluten-free pasta. Apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order. So not cool. We just paid for our drinks and left.",

With it's popularity, there can be quite a wait on some nights. 3. I can't really think of a 3, but I wanted to have at least 3 things here...  Positives: 1. Food is good, and everyone can find something they will like.  Nothing to experimental, too trendy or too expensive. 2. The decor.  They could serve McDonald's food and the decor would find a way to save them from one star hell.  The much-mentioned trolley car in the center is fun, but I love even more sitting in the library room (or so we call it).  Or at one of the big tables with the big velvet chairs.   3. Great for when you have a lot of people in your party, and/or when there are kids.  I'm kind of stumped when I see folks mention this as a bad thing.   4. Even when you are waiting, there are awesome chairs and sofas in multiple rooms where you can mingle.   5. Ms. Packman!  How it is no one has mentioned this?  We've had Ms. Packman competitions while waiting for a table several times.  6. The place is really huge.  Why is this good?  Because if you go at a non-peak time, while not typically a date kind of restaurant, if you ask to get put in a quiet spot, it can feel like you have the whole place to yourself.   7. Location.  How much family friendly fare is down here?  Another reason the place is always packed. 8. Spumoni or sherbet is included with your meal.  Heck yea.  Listen, this isn't the cool and chic place to be, but it's nice, kinda fun and pretty well liked by most people.  Very kid friendly.  And who knows, you just might like it too.",

You will be eating your salad when the main meal comes out. We are not paying for a four course meal.  The atmosphere is kitchy and its fun!   The location in Seattle is my favorite but now living in Phoenix, I make the trip to get downtown. I finally convinced my boyfriend to take the trip last sunday and he was very impressed with quality and price. So much that when we woke up this morning he said he wanted to go there again for lunch today. We usually make our way straight to the lounge so we do not have to wait to get seated and so we can watch sports on tv while enjoying our meal.   We had the same server last week who is very quiet but prompt.  Do not expect the best service, as a past server, smaller checks (food is cheap) means smaller tips and servers are not as frantic to help you out.    As far as the menu, get the cheesy garlic bead, get the ranch!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is mixed with pesto.  I will sometimes ask for a to-go container just so I can have some at home. JESUS DEAR LORD it is amazing.  All of the pasta dishes taste about the same but make sure that you get brown butter Mazitha pasta.  After having this years ago, i make this at home but it is still never as good.    I will always come back to this place.  I love it.",

Hubby and I waited only 10 min on a Saturday night at 8 pm. We both got the lasagna, the bread they gave us was super hot and yummy, I got the minestrone soup and the hubby a salad. The salad tasted a tad funky, my hubby said the ranch dressing tasted weird.... I got the minestrone soup which tasted home made, filled with veggies. We finally got our lasagna; kind of small portion, Tate's like your standard homemade pasta, nothing special... It was okay, we were looking for the pizzazz of some sort... Price was great, for the both of us it was 31 dollars. We probably wouldn't come again tho, it was a nice experience to try something new and different.",

There's a Trolly in the middle, which is always a treat to be able to sit in.   The service is usually stellar, in fact, the last young lady (I feel awful for forgetting her name) not only joked along with us, but we danced the Charleston together!   I've been coming to this place since I was a child, and I was devastated to find out it's a chain. But this particular location earns it's credibility back with the great history, and the consistent food and service.   Anywhere I go, I hold the Mizithra standard to This location. I always eat too much, and never regret it.   It's always nice to know there is a scoop of ice cream for desert after, especially when connecting with old friends, and wanting time to leisurely chat over desert.   I will continue to visit, and enjoy myself at the Old Spaghetti Factory.   (Side note: I recently went on a Haunted Bus tour of Phoenix, and apparently this location is Haunted by the ghost of a child, who like to poke people in the behind! I have never experienced it, but watch your fanny! haha)",

We had called ahead about 30 mins before to let them know and they said that although it was too late to make a reservation it wouldn't be a problem to seat us. So we get there and it takes about 15 mins to seat us even though the restaurant is not that busy and smaller parties are getting seated before us. Okay, fine.   Then we get seated and it takes us another 20 mins and a chase down with a waiter for us to get our order taken and even get water. Our food came out fast enough after that point and the waitress was great about dividing the check but it seriously should not take 35 mins to get your order taken on a Thursday afternoon at a restaurant like this.",

It makes for interesting conversation pieces. The food is good. I usually get the \"Managers Special\" which is pasta with your choice of 2 sauces. I always get half clam sauce and half mizithra cheese with brown butter. Yum! All of their dinners include fresh baked bread, salad or soup and a scoop of ice cream. The prices are great, but the service can be hit or miss. Great for large parties or kids! There's even a real trolley inside. The food is good, not great, but good. 4 stars for good food, great atmosphere and reasonable prices!",

    "text": "I have been here three times with large parties (I.e., bridal, birthday, business). Those experiences were wonderful. However I always had to eat what was on the prepared menu for that party. I have wanted to try this place alone for some time.  I choose the l late afternoon lunch hour being quiet and empty. My server was Jim and he was wonderfully attentive. He suggested the  Mizithra with browned butter. I selected that with lasagne and broccoli. The meal came with bread, salad and spumoni.   The salad was good, average, and the Lasange was ok. The portions were excellent in comparison to other restraunts. The bread was a bit hard. However it is sourdough roll and typically they are. It was hot and had a great taste. The Mizithra was phenomenal. Must try if you stop by. I'm glad he didn't tell me it was sheep/goat cheese first or I may not have tried it. This must be their signature dish because I would return for this and the service.   I would have given five stars if the lasagne was as good as it was the the time I came here. Too inconsistent   The best part was the Mizithra, server Jim, and the spumoni. The ambiance is nice too.. Very calming.  In my opinion, the Old Spaghetti Factory is much better as a large party or catering type establishment.   I will definitely return",

    "text": "This restaurant has to be one of the worst experiences I've ever had in the food industry. I was in the area for an event and my party of 7 decided we would go to the Old Spaghetti Factory, it's safe to say we made the wrong decision. My party consisted of 5 adults and 2 children. The children both ordered off of the kids menu and the rest of us ordered from the main menu. Two of the people in my party including myself ordered the chicken parmigiana and it's was absolutely terrible. The pasta and marinara sauce was great but the chicken was horrific. The chicken tasted as if it was old and even smelt funny. I took one bite of my chicken and spit the other bite back onto the plate because the chicken was so foul. I told by my waitress who was named Carolina, that a manger would come talk to me. So I guess I was wrong in assuming that the manager would apologize and comp my meal. After we got our checks, we called the manager over because multiple things were wrong our my party's tickets. I was charged for the chicken parmigiana that I sent back as well as the other 2 people in my party. One women in my party was really upset and stated that she should only be charged for spaghetti with marinara since she didn't eat the chicken. The manager named Brittany was so rude to the woman in my party. Brittany argued with the guest in my party stating she didn't send her food back, instead she was simply done. So Brittany took off a portion of her bill for the chicken(she only took off 3 dollars). However since I took 2 bites of my chicken, she wouldn't comp part of my meal. The 2 children in my party ordered directly from the kids menu and on the kids menu was a milkshake, so they kids decided to order one each. When the check came they price of the milkshake was almost double the price of the milkshake on the kids menu. When we asked the manager about it, she said \"well the kids received their milkshakes in regular cups instead of kids cups therefore we charged you for the regular one\". Even though the kids ordered off of the kids menu they charged them with regular menu prices. The manager Brittany refused to correct the price of the milkshakes. Not only was the service bad almost all of the food was terrible, not just the chicken parmigiana. One of the children ordered pasta and it made her so sick after she ate it, she had to run to the bathroom in the restaurant to vomit. Also, all of the people that got the chicken parmigiana and tried the chicken, are violently ill to our stomachs. I think it's safe to say I will NEVER EVER go back and I hope that you don't either because I wouldn't wish this terrible experience on anyone!",

    "text": "A good friend and I were in downtown Phoenix at lunchtime.  I was excited we might eat at one of my favorites along Central (Postino, Fez, Windsor).  But, since it was really my friend's day, when she asked about restaurants, I deferred, \"What did you have in mind?\"  She said \"How about The Old Spaghetti Factory\".  I tried not to let my lip curl in disgust (I dislike all chain Italian restaurants).  But, again, deferring to her, I said \"Sure, I always like to try new places.\"   We were seated fairly promptly.  The decor was kitschy, but we had a nice table with comfy chairs.  Our waiter brought bread and took our drink order.  I asked if their iced tea was caffeine free, he said \"Oh yes, we brew it ourselves.\"  WHAT?!?.  Just because they brew it instead of taking it from a soda gun doesn't guarantee it's caffeine free.  Having been there before, my friend knew she wanted the lasagna.  Being Italian, I never order lasagna in restaurants as I know mine is better ( I make 2 kinds of lasagna, regular that just takes a few hours, and then the grand dame,  lasagna bolognese, which takes 2 days, with all the braising and creating 2 separate sauces).  I had a bad vibe theirs wouldn't hold a candle to even my \"lazy\" lasagna.  I chose spaghetti with mizithra and brown butter, supposedly their signature dish.  All entrees come with bread, soup or salad, and tea or coffee.  Our waiter took our order.  My friend asked for the lunch portion of lasagna.  The waiter replied \"Oh, we don't have lunch portions of the lasagna, just dinner size.\".  My first thought: it's FROZEN.  My second thought: nice way to up-sell buddy.  She had cream of broccoli soup and I had salad with pesto ranch on the side.  Our waiter delivered the soup and salad, but forgot the dressing.  He said he'd be right back with it.  When we flagged him down 5 minutes later, he was surprised I had no dressing, saying \"I told the busboy to bring it to you.\"  This must have been the same busboy who was so busy doing anything but his job that a nearby table remained uncleared during our entire meal.  Soon, he dropped off a small silver dish containing a pesto ranch popsicle.  Yes, the dressing was FROZEN.  I had to stir it so it would thaw enough to pour.  The salad was a big plate of pedestrian iceberg, cabbage and carrots with packaged croutons that appeared as if they had been chopped in half to stretch them.  My friend was sorely disappointed with her lasagna, saying it didn't taste like she remembered from past visits.  I told her it was probably because it was frozen pre-packaged, which was why they couldn't cut it into lunch portions.  My spaghetti with mizithra was so bland, I'm sure any finicky toddler or nursing home patient with a digestive disorder could have tolerated it (and I'm not insulting seniors or anyone with digestive issues, as my husband suffers from one, I'm just commenting on the utter lack of flavor in this dish).  Where's the garlic?  Where's the nutty goodness of brown butter?  I don't think what they used ever came from a cow, I'm quite sure it was industrial grade margarine.    Sadly, even their bread wasn't all that flavorful.  It looked and smelled good when it first arrived hot to the table, but shortly after, it seemed extremely flavorless and the \"butter\" added nothing.  All I could think was \"Robert Irvine would have a field day trying to fix this place on Restaurant:  Impossible!\", then I remembered he doesn't work with chains.  As Daniel D alluded, Olive Garden would have been a better choice.",

    "text": "The more things change, the more they stay the same!  First started going to OSF (Or was it Spag. Co??) on Mill Ave as a teenager. Dad and Mom had just split (temporarily) and Dad didn't have a lot of money. He'd take me here on payday, and it became a bit of a tradition for us. Back then, it was a place where we could have a \"real\" sit down dinner with soup or salad, entree, fresh bread and garlic butter, drink and dessert for CHEAP!  These days, it's a place where you can have a \"real\" sit down dinner with soup or salad, entree, fresh bread and garlic butter, drink and dessert for CHEAP!  Love the historic building.  Love the furniture, decor, antiques and mock-antiques.  (Granted, I didn't know any of them were mock until I met the man who does most of the stained glass that I *thought* was vintage.)  Even though there's a huge capacity, it's split up to feel much more intimate.  Is any of the food amazing?  No, but it's not trying to be.  This is good, old-fashioned Italian-American comfort food.  Sure, there's a couple updates (pesto ranch dressing, gluten free pasta) - but for the most part, it's the same menu you'd see in an Italian restaurant anywhere in America in the 1950's and 60's.  No risks taken on the menu - all very safe, middle of the road fare.  But sometimes - that's *exactly* what I want!  Service is always friendly, food is always fresh, I've never left hungy.  Oh, and it's CHEAP!",

Why the renovation? I don't understand how they are still in business.",

The ambiance is fun and family feeling.   Maybe it's because the food is just okay but I want it to be better because I want to like the place.  It's holds some nostalgic memories for me as well as the the quirky atmosphere that some would call old, but I like it. It  makes me enjoy actually being there, maybe not eating there though.   This is a pretty lame review actually.  What was the point of this?  Not sure.",

The building was cool... a former house, I guess. But the interior was pretty cool, lots of small steps down and up every here and there.   We had a large closed-off area for our group. No issues with the timing of the food or anything, as we had a couple servers overlooking our party of 20.   I had the lasagna - -which was great! For dessert, I think we all had the mocha pie (or something like that). It was awesome!  I'll come back again another time with my husband. Good times!",

But I also felt overwhelmed as if it was a labyrinth of Italian food - but I also understand its been their for a good amount of time so that has no bearing on the star rating.  Anyways. Service was really lacking here.  Ordered a beer when we sat down and didn't get it until after the appetizer.  Got the artichoke dip.  It was good but the value for what we paid wasn't worth it. Free bread was good. Nice and warm and tasty.  Entrees came and were good too.  Pasta cooked well.  Got the brown butter with cheese, very tasty. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food as well.  When server brought entrees said shed be back to refill water glasses, that didn't happen until desserts came......., so why even come? Not only that but our cheese dispenser was empty when we sat down, was told by runner that he would bring a new one, waited for 5 min, then I just got up and took it from another table.   Not sure if it was just bc of the specials they were running and thus slowing down service but I would go back bc of the price point of the food. But if the service was the same I'd probably not come.",

If you are looking for a nice Spaghetti Factory try this one instead of the one in Chandler. Chandler is horrendous. Phoenix has never done us wrong and is always good. Chandler has common dirty dishes, extremely hard bread and the staff seems to be at a level of incompetence to drive a customer crazy. Unfortunately the only word Chandler store seems to get right \"I'm sorry.\"  This Phoenix location is in the habit of saying \"see you soon.\" Great food and they know it. This probably also explains the fact that we always have to wait for service in Phoenix where Chandler is always immediate seating. Apparently, I am NOT the only person who prefers the Phoenix store.",

Of course all their meals come with bread, soup or salad, a drink and a scoop of ice cream or sherbet at the end. And I think my entree was like $12.99. Total pasta score in my book.

The place is awesome, very big and large, filled with low lighting (Keep this in mind) and a lot of historic decor. Wooden floors that creak and crack, and memorabilia on the walls. Sadly, this doesn't really do justice since the food was plain 'Meh'  2. I had better food. In fact, the Olive Garden serves better food then this place. The Chicken was warm inside out and the meat sauce tastes a bit sour, like it was getting bad. My SO had the meat balls, but the low lighting made it hard to tell if it was cooked our not. After opening one of the meat balls, it was a bit red. A Manager came and told us, this is how it is due to how the meatballs was cooked.   Like my 2 star rating indicates, I've experience better food. If it wasn't for the decor, I would give his a 1 star, but the feeling of eating in a old house feels great. It's just too bad we had to eat this kind of food here.   As for the service, it was okay, not too bad or too good.",

The server proceeds to tell us \"sorry the other server didn't want this table because you have 7 kids here!\" Uh really there is literally not one other patron in the place. Took drink order and brought kids all cups with no lids. Food came out fairly timely. I had pick 2- lasagna was fair but the chicken Marsala was horrendous. NEVER AGAIN!",

    "text": "The restaurant reminds me of a quaint little countryside cafe.   It gives me that homey feeling like a mom and pop store instead of the chain restaurant that it is. I like how whatever entree you order from the menu; you can get a complete meal from it.  Each entree comes with a drink, bread, soup or salad, and their spumoni ice cream for dessert.  However, if you want \"Italian\" food, you're not going to get it here.  It's a very Americanized version of Italian food.  They do have all the classics: the pastas, lasagnas, etc.  I've been here several times and tried a few of their dishes.  Spaghetti Vesuvius:  cute name to start off.  Spicy chicken sausage and meatballs with mushroom.  I didn't think it was that spicy, but it was extra salty.  It's a very flavorful dish, however the individual tastes are all mushed together.  The noodles are a bit tough for me; perhaps undercooked.  However some people like it a bit tough.    Gourmet Jumbo Crab Ravioli:  There's not a lot of ravioli pieces in the dish.  The edges that were not covered in the pesto alfredo sauce was dry.  I did like that they used fresh crab meat in the ravioli.  The creamy sauce was not bad and it wasn't too overpowering in my mouth.  It was able to taste pesto sauce and still enjoy the texture of the crab.    Baked Lasagna:  This is the best of the 3 I've had.  It has 4 kinds of cheese, ground beef, and pork.  First of all they gave you a huge piece of lasagna. Then they topped it with mounds of marinara sauce.  You may have to remove some of the sauce if it's too much for you.  The noodles were cooked tender enough for my taste, but it was still able to hold its shape.  And the meat was blended well with all the flavors of the dish.    I do like the cute little serving they have of the spumoni ice cream.  It's a great blend of pistachio, chocolate and strawberry.  And it's just the right amount after a large meal.  Maybe one of these days I'll go back just to try their chocolate desserts.    If you like an American spin on Italian food, then you would like this place.  It's a convenient place to eat after shopping at the mall and their quick service is great if you're crunched for time.  But the food is just average and not that special.",

It was so bad that both myself and one of my party offered to help clean so we could have a seat! 4 hostesses all standing around not doing much and busers taking their sweet time cleaning tables joking around with the management staff women working. 2 hours later finally seated and they squeeze us (10) into a small room. When I asked about the bigger table they said nobody was staffed there. Arrived at 7pm seated at 9pm. Only person who did a decent job was our waitress. At least she was the only one that tried.",

I usually can't finish a full meal in one sitting but it was so good I somehow found room to eat every last bite as well as share a dessert. I got the baked chicken which had good seasoning, but was a little dry. The dish came with a side of pasta and I got the spaghetti with mizithra cheese and browned butter. It was amazing!The dinner comes with free ice cream or sorbet but I opted to pay extra to get the mud pie. I have no regrets in doing that! The dessert was delicious.

This was a disappointment because we have eaten here in the past and the food had been very good. We don't know if it was because we were part of the murder mystery group or maybe just an off night. I had the spaghetti with mushrooms and it was very bland. I had been expecting a mushroom sauce however all it consisted of was a basic marinara sauce with about four sliced mushrooms on top. We only received one loaf of bread during the salad course between six people and was not offered anymore during our meal. They brought our plates out in piecemeal fashion so those that got theirs first became cold while we waited for the rest of the table to receive their's. In addition we had to ask for parmesan  cheese and it took forever for them to finally bring it so by the time it came our pasta was even colder.  The murder mystery portion was good and it made for a fun evening and I would definitely recommend it to others.",

The salad was dumped out of a bag onto a plate. Over priced cafeteria food at that.. I have tried this place twice now just to give them the benefit of doubt. I even ordered the spaghetti this time thinking that maybe that would be awesome since after all you are the spaghetti factory.. nope it's disgusting",

Now a days if you enter your cell phone in the ipad at the entrance they will send you specials via text message.   Would always order the Managers Special and get half clam sauce and half met sauce. The meal comes with salad or soup and dessert ice cream and use to include ice tea which is a dollar now.  Not the most incredible pasta you will ever have but good especially if you can get a 2 for 1 special.  Will always come back for more but will try to take advantage of the specials to maximize the dollar.  Service is generally good and the parking is limited in the front but there is plenty in the back.  Will be back again and again",

We choose this restaurant for my special needs sons birthday., I stress this point only because we put in a reservation a week  early and I called the day before and the day of just before we left to ensure everything was ok and taken care of. So when we arrived my wife let the hostess know we were there for our reservation they told us to have a seat and the would seat us.WE WAITED 25 MINUTES AND NO ONE TALKED TO US OR EVEN APPROACHED US. Needless to say my son's birthday was ruined, and when I asked why we had not been seated THEY SAID WE HAD BEEN PUT ON THE \"NO SHOW\" LIST .... REALLY WE SAT HERE FOR 25 MINUTES.. never again will I ever go to this establishment... HORRIBLE",

Call ahead reservations are encouraged on the busy nights, otherwise you could wait a good long time to be seated. Recommend this place to people who want a good meal on a reasonably price budget. Also great for families and parties.  Decided to come in again tonight. They had a BOGO and had been awhile since last visit.  This one is not starting off well when 4 people are standing at the checkin booth   The. We get seated next to the kitchen because a server was able to add us to his list of tables.  Should have just walked out then.  Server comes by and acknowledges us and says will be right back.  Yeah 7-8 mins later.  Then try to order house salad but with the dressing Casar.   Cannot do it without N up charge of 1.50. Ummm, say what.  We were not asking for the Ceasar salad, just the dressing.  Anyways, again did not get custom service.    Since our last visit they have changed the sour dough bread and not for the better.  Also now using aluminum take away containers.  Not microwave friendly.",

I opted for soda and my husband had the wine. We were charged for the soda even though I cannot have wine. We also were asked if we wanted soup or salad, I chose a Caesar salad but was not informed that there was an upcharge. Anyways, all in all it was a great price and the food was decent.

I ordered the shrimp alfredo which originally doesn't come with artichokes so I told the waiter to add artichokes and he says yeah yeah I can do that the only problem is oh yeah he didn't! We then asked the manager to come over and he tells us that he didn't want to open another can of artichokes just for my meal he was too much of a cheap skate.   Also I ordered a Long Island and the lady looked at me like I was from Mars and the manager says oh she was the hostess she doesn't know about drinks cuz she's underage nice defense doesn't make any sense it's common knowledge.  So then I finally get my Long Island after waiting 35 minutes and they bring me a Blackberry flavor Long Island like I'm a little kid or something I wanted a regular Long Island. I didn't want to wait another 35 minutes so I just drank it tasted like a virgin Long Island with crappy BlackBerry flavor   Overall horrible experience would not recommend to anybody over price food Olive Garden would have been better",

We came for his tenth birthday and of course, he had the spaghetti and he LOVED every bite. (He went with the version that had the mizithra cheese and browned butter sauce). They made sure to sing to him and bring a desert wich is always appreciated. My wife had a seafood stuffed ravioli and I had the chicken Alfredo and both really enjoyed our food. My daughter went the spaghetti route as well and we were all full and satisfied.   The inside has a fun yet old antiquey type feeling and decor, pretty cool in its own way. We made reservations ahead of time and we're seated quickly. The wine menu was limited but prices were better than expected and we really enjoyed the bottle we selected. I really like the location they sat us at because it was mostly enclosed on 3 sides with a sliding curtain and provided a little seclusion and privacy and the server could just come and go. Overall a great experience and the kids have already asked to go back. 4 stars for our visit",

Service however, I went there for the first time not too long ago with my (now) fiancee. I was impressed by that server and the food, gave a 20% tip,  and so I came again. This time was with my parents because I raved about it, but the bread was so hard we could have hurt someone with it, but the server gave us a different one and it was better.. not perfect, but better. The server was not very attentive, letting us all have empty cups of water (it's 110 degrees out, got to stay hydrated) among other things.. I went again with my fiancee and her family, this time everything was great from the kitchen, but the server never took empty bowls or plates away so we were pretty crowded, drinks were hard to come by, and even after the check came not a single plate or soup bowl left our table. And the last attempt was with my fiancee and different family members.. the same exact thing happened, different server, but this time we got a italian cream soda with a keepsake glass, and I asked if we could take it home and he said yes.. but I know for a fact they are supposed to give you a clean one as I had inquired about that with a different server.. so I had to take a dirty glass out of the restaurant and bring it home to wash it..  Overall good food and prices.. but service needs some working on",

It is Wednesday 5:30, not busy at all. We had an appetizer of spinach artichoke dip, it was okay. The bread it was served with had an old taste to it. My husband enjoyed his minestrone soup and unfortunately my salad was nothing but a ready made salad thrown with a couple of croutons. :( Our entries arrived and my husband was very impressed with the lasagna and its size. My chicken parmesan had a very good flavor however was a little over cooked. The spaghetti did need more marinara, more was provided upon request. Then came the scoop of spumoni. That was a nice yummy treat. I know I sound negative and I do not like that but I am only being honest. Oh I forgot before dinner I went to wash my hands and a homeless woman went into the bathroom and started to use the sink as her personal bath tub. Ewwwww! I did let them know.

We arrived around 5:30 and were seated. For five people during the early dinner hour it should have been a breeze. Our bread arrived fresh out of the oven too hot to handle and our food arrived about an hour later cold to the touch with hot sauce.  Since this was out of the norm for a table of five early in the evening we kindly told our server Shayna that the food was cold. She kindly collected all of our plates and told us they would remake our food. The next round came out lukewarm at best delivered by the manager who could barely reign in her disgust that we would be so bold as to complain. When told that this go around was also cold save for one plate, she  in all her young haughtiness told us the food was \"at temp\". This was such a disappointing experience. The women's room was a hot mess and still after an hour the paper towels had not been restored. Apparently the best time to come is when it's busy. Last week during the dinner rush the food was great and HOT.",

The 3 course meal makes you think you're getting a deal but to me it's not worth it if the  entree isn't good. We all liked the bread, salad/soup and scoop of ice cream for dessert more than the meal itself. I got some spicy dish with three different meats, my bf got a ravioli platter and our friend had the lasagna. When they first came out our plates were barely warm and I looked at my friends lasagna and the meat layers looked so stiff. Took a bite of mine and the meat was cool, like they didn't even warm it up enough with the sauce. My bfs ravioli didn't have the cheese melted and mixed evenly with the sauce. Friend took a bite of his lasagna and said it wasn't cooked all the way. Told the waiter they brought out new ones and theirs were warmer/reheated but mine still had \"cool\" meat.... I just ate the noodles and left the meat. Meats that haven't been warmed/cooked enough just makes me think of bacteria. Also, these were the saddest looking entrees and the portions were small compared to OG. So no thanks, I'll give my money to Olive Garden instead.",

Then I noticed I've been to many of the locations listed on the menu. So it hit me, I need to type up a review for each location I've been to. But the truth is that they are all good. The food is yummy and I think the home made salad dressing us the best. I love the atmosphere and of corse the garlic bread. If you have not been to one of the many locations I highly recommend you give them a try. If your in vacation and want a fun family restaurant give them a call and bake a reservation because some times the wait is long.",

If u look at my other reviews you will find I never really rate badly... I try to rate things I like not hate... But she was annoying maybe it's cuz I'm from Los Angeles and in that city we have a lot of respect for our clients... Not only did she lie and say we r at our reservation time (which we did time ourselves it was 15+ min over 30min which was the original time) but she was snippy and rude and was defiantly not what I want to see when I'm being greeted. The waitress was nice she took out order and smiled she took 5 min to say hello but this place looks pretty busy so that was ok. She was very sweet! And she was super quick with the rest of the meal! Food was Out in maybe 15 tops after we told her we needed to rush back. Her name was Tanika and she was wonderful! She really turned our experience around!   Also the sinks in the girls room would not stop dropping and that's really wasteful... Conserve water people...",

I had the spaghetti squash with spicy marinara, it came with soup/salad, bread and spumoni. The bread is a sourdough loaf, not my preference so I didn't eat it. I can't eat lettuce/cabbage and they only had minestrone soup with cabbage and salad as the side choices...they offered me a child's applesauce as the only possible alternative; I opted out. I was very hungry by the time the spaghetti squash arrived, but it was over-cooked and dried out plus a significant lack of sauce. The waiter was nice enough but barely saw him and when I did he was pretty rushed and frantic...there really weren't that many people there. I had to ask for the spumoni at the end of the meal after paying the bill.",

I was with 2 of my 4 children and had asked for bread and was told not until you put in your entree. What sense does that make so my kids have to scream and starve because you can't get them bread wtf. Like that wasn't bad enough she drops the food and that was the last time I seen my waitress. I waited over 20 mins for her to return and she never did so i had to ask someone else for my check. But she must have had checked on the table behind us every 2 mins flurting and bull shitting. I couldn't even get my water refilled. Besides the fact that the 2 chicken parm sandwiches we ordered were burnt but no one cared. I get my check and tell the floor manger how horrible the experience was and the food that was half eaten because couldn't force another bit down due to the horrible taste. He takes my card says sorry and charges me for everything. On the way out I proceeded to inform the big manger how my experience was. His response I'm sorry next time you come back let one of us know and we will take care of it. Mind blown next time there will never be a next time and I made that clear. He obviously just didn't feel like addressing the problem. I would never recommend this location to anyone the service and food sucks. If you bring it up to management don't worry they don't care and won't do anything anyway. Don't waste your time or you money going here. The only good thing was the decor.",

In the women's bathroom, you do feel like you're being watched, every step of the way. =)  We have sat in the trolley and in the booths. Bring a flashlight because it's way too dark. The menu resembles a newspaper. If you get overwhelmed by the menu, remember that you can always get spaghetti.

I love the wooden decor, the tables and chairs, and the antique lighting.  The service is fast,  friendly and attentive. Wait times exceeded my expectations both times.  I had the browned butter and mithyra spaghetti, which is so insanely good and buttery that I had it both times I went there. Next time I will try something else, but I can confirm that it is consistently good! The chicken marsala is pretty tasty as well. It was moist, thick, and perfectly cooked and seasoned. The salad and soup are average, but the breadsticks may be a little on the tough side. I've had a bit of trouble cutting them with the dull cutlery provided. The spumoni was delicious and a very nice nightcap to a good Italian meal.   I would recommend this restaurant as a good place to take family and maybe friends from out of town. Maybe not a good restaurant for a first date because of all the kids running around. But I went here fully expecting that, and it didn't bother me much. It's a very good value for the money (about $30 for 2 people).  I will continue to dine here when I crave Italian.",

    "text": "I'm being generous with one star! My step daughter was leaving to Texas for Airforce basic training and we had a party of 12. Our reservation was for 5 as she had to be back at her hotel for briefing by 8p.m. The hostess staff was very cold an uninviting in general. We were seated and waited for our server who must have been lost. Bear in mind the place was nearly empty with staff visibly standing around doing nothing. We put in our drink order and appetizer order, no drinks for at least 15 minutes... After 25+ minutes we finally got our cheesy garlic bread and shrimp scampi. Bread was fine, the scampi was a few small shrimp swimming in a bowl or luke warm butter with little to no flavor. Our water glasses were empty for almost an hour then we finally were served our entrees. My husband did not touch his chicken fettuccine and my brother in laws meat balls were dry and needed a sharp knife to cut. I almost forgot to mention our server arrived with the entrees sweating like he had run a marathon, appetite killer for me. Our server never came back to notice the majority of the party hardly touched their food or to ask if we needed anything. I had to go ask the very rude unaccommodating curly brown haired hostess if she could get us some crushed red peppers since I could not find my server. The best part of the meal was the free ice cream at the end which everyone ate because they were still hungry from not eating their food. It is now 740 and my daughter needs to be back at her hotel by 8 o'clock and my server is nowhere to be found so again I go to the hostess desk and stand there while she's chatting with another employee waiting patiently for her to acknowledge my presence, I say excuse me can you please go find my server we need to get going. All in all very disappointed and we will not be back. Lesson learned always check yelp before visiting any restaurant.",

We had a reservation for 6:30 granted we went early to see if we could be seated earlier but no luck needless to say we did not get seated till almost 7. The hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved. My kids did not like to food at all and they love spaghetti and meatballs. Food did not come out hot at all. The food was also average nothing special about it. I would not recommend this place and will not be coming back.",

The Lasagna was slightly cold and the chicken marsala had a rubbery/fatty bottom that I ended up cutting the chicken up and not eating it.",

    "text": "I don't know why I like this place!  The food is average- not craveable. The service is consistently bad. I'm sorry, but I have encountered so many clueless employees at this place that are too pathetic to even complain about.   That aside, I like the way this place feels. It's fun to take my younger family members from out of town.  What kid wouldn't want to eat lunch in an old-time train car? Plus, ice cream is free with a dinner- can't beat that! Don't expect your waiter to be a wine expert- or even know what a mimosa is during Sunday brunch- but, it is a cute little place with lots of fun memorabilia.  Like I said, the food is not going to knock your socks off, but it's not that bad- just forgettable.  Stick to the basics that are hard to mess up, like lasagna, and enjoy that free ice cream (I suggest the spumoni).",

    "text": "This place is like your fave tried & True shoes. You know the ones. Yup those! Priced right, good sized menu & helpful staff. Love this place & have since I was a kid. I've had the pleasure of eating my fave mizithra with brown butter since I was a teen. Not sure why I chose that as a teen after my years hooked on the spaghetti with clam sauce but there you have it. They've since added another way to consume my fave by adding bacon & mushrooms to an already yummy dish. The bread still included & served hot with the garlic butter to shmear all over the place. Bleu cheese dressing still good too. Some things you just don't monkey with. In addition to how good everything tastes (not just my fave btw) the food is priced right. Where else is your drink albeit iced tea or milk included with your entree & desert too?  No where. So your next trip check out the Old Spaghetti Factory.",
